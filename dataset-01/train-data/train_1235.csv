5,Great Single,The piano pieces 'All the Girls Hate Her' and 'Over It' make me want to take up the piano. Definately a single anyone should have.
3,Tori Amos - God,"Tori Amos meets God meets Carl Craig. A match made in heaven? The Joy also put in their piece of divinity, a spaced-out ambient track that grows into a funk workout. When Carl Craig takes the reins for ""The Rainforest Resort Mix,"" he drops in a mid-tempo house kick drum and slows the vocals down until to a husky growl. It's not until the halfway point that the Detroitian synths come in. In his ""Thinking Mix 2,"" he keeps the vocals intact, but both mixes opt more for minimalism, rather than full sounds. While the mixes overall don't reach heaven, you can still dance in purgatory."
3,Tori COMPLETELY solo!,"If you want to hear beautiful classical sounding music, done by tori, then this is the CD. I do not really care much for home on the range, but the solo songs are really beautiful. God is God....however..I think this is the one tori CD single you can miss."
4,Shake your hips to this remixed favorite!,"God becomes a hip shaking mix set to a heavy drum beat [The Rainforest Resort Mix], you also have a beautiful piano suite [All the Girls hate Her] even without words this song ""speaks"" for itself its beautiful and Melodic. A perfect addition for any Tori fan, or for anyone looking for something truely different."
2,Not her best,"I love the song ""God"" from Under the Pink, but I don't usually buy singles. Tori Amos is my big exception, I'm trying to buy all her music. I bought this because I thought I'd enjoy ""Home On the Range"", ""All the Girls Hate Her"", and ""Over It."" I was unpleasantly surprised to find that the last two songs were just instrumental and there was no singing at all. Tori played very well and all, but I buy her music because I like her voice and lyrics. Home On the Range was nice, but it's just that--the song ""Home on the Range."" Nothing spectacular. So, this was not Tori's best display."
4,Good space opera,"Lost, pursued by hostile aliens, his ship disabled, Commodore Abraham Briggs has one last hope. Beneath him lies a strangely beautiful world. From it he may refuel his ship, find his bearings, and plot his course home.But the Ecolog, masked ruler of a feudal empire, has other plans . . . and on this remote and contradictory planet, she is omnipotent!"
1,No.,"I can't quite believe what I read here. I truly love Glass, Riley or Reich. But this here is nothing - it is on the same level as Cage's nothingness, except that there is one tone."
2,Slowest Order!,"I've been purchasing products from Amazon for a long time and this is by far the worst experience to date. The product is nice but it took 3 weeks to receive it. I purchased the expedited shipping method to surprise my girlfriend for mothers day, but it still took almost 3 weeks to process this order. I highly recommend contacting the seller for processing details."
3,Air mattress,This air mattress is as advertised. Not too expensive. It works and inflates ok but the initial smell of rubber was overwhelming. I put a mattress cover on it and the smell eventually got better. It still had a definate odor when I stopped using it after 7 days.
5,One of the best!,Talent is one of many good words that come to mind when you read this book! Brandon Cavendish's parents prove once again that opposites attract!
3,Well made however I question the high price,"This is a well made tunnel. It can be used with the risers and supports to be a covered bridge or put flat on the table to be used and a tunnel. The graphics are greaat, which is typical for this brand. The riser tracks and supports fit well together and is pretty stable. I have not had problems that soem other described. Howevr I do use those suretrack clips at the bottom of the risers which give it more stability.My only gripe is the price. With no moving parts I'm not sure how this tunnel can retail at $25 which is the same for the water tower and just a bit cheaper than the mine tunnel. Of course it can be had for cheaper here, but still a bit pricey for a simple tunnel."
5,Absolutely Adorable,The OSU romper was a huge hit at the baby shower. The mother-to-be loved it. She can't wait for the baby to grow into it.
2,poor quality,It is a new lighter weight than the last pair I had. I liked the fit but in less than a week there was a hole along the seam on a leg.
3,fit and finish,"I meant to order 34x34 but ordered 33x34 by mistake. I found that they fit a little snug but I guess I liked that. It reminded me of my Levis jeans I wore all the time in the ""70s.(oh well) I read some of the reviews about them being made in different places around the world, so I was cautious about ordering another pair. I ordered the same exact ones so as to have the same exact fit.The first pair however, after a couple days, I noticed that the seam on the right leg didn't go down the side all the way but curved around toward the front of the leg. It's extremely easy to return though, and they sent another pair out before I even returned these. I don't remember where the first pair was made but the two I have now were made in Nicaragua. They both seem to be good. thanx..."
2,Not what I expected,"I always wear the Levi's 505 straight leg jeans. However, these are of a softer, inferior fabric than I expected. I have myself to blame. I have learned over time that jeans are the one thing that should not be ordered online. It's always better to go to a store (I use Macy's downtown location in Washington, D.C.), try them on, and make certain the fabric is what you're looking for and the size is right. I will wear them, but I don't care for them. (I hate returning products. Just do not like to return.) The main reason I didn't go out and buy a pair is that Amazon had such a great price -- and now I see why. At no place on the page from which did I see anything saying these were not the stone-washed denim jeans I prefer."
1,the jeans i ordered,"i am sure you hear this all the time,they do not make them like they used to..the delivery was prompt and handled professionally,just wrong size,at all.has worn the same size for 30 years,oh well.."
2,What has happened to Levi's?,I believe that I have just bought my last pair of Levi's. They have been my favorite jeans brand for years but these are not what they used to be. The fit is awful and I'm not even sure that the denim fabric is the same. I'll admit that I haven't bought a new pair in several years but these seem like an entirely different brand. I plan to start shopping around to find another brand that I will like better. It's sad to say goodbye to such an old frriend.
2,Streaks,After second washing there are major streaks across both front pockets and crotch as if fabric color faded due to poor dye?
2,Could be better,"These jeans fit very well. However, the fabric's inside finish was extremely rough, making the jeans uncomfortable to wear. Comfort improved slightly after several washes."
4,"The pants are good, but I had to adjust","Even though they changed the 505's name back to regular fit, it still feels like the straight fit (a little slimmer). I'm not really comfortable in slim pants, so I really disliked that after a year, my last 505 pants shrunk to the point of being uncomfortable to wear. Levi's usually last me over 2 years, before I have to donate them. This time I bought 1 waist size up to make up for the modern, slimmer straight fit. The pants feel like a half size bigger after the up size, but it's nothing a belt didn't fix. After a year of washing, I'm sure the pants will eventually feel just right. Too bad levi's are getting more expensive..."
1,Levi's 505,The color and weight of material was way inferior to what the stores carry. The price was no better than what stores advertise for their sale price. Either the pair I received was a second or was made at a different quality per Amazon's contract with Levi.
3,Light Weight Fabric,These jeans fit well but the denim is too thin to use for actual work or riding a horse. They wouldn't last under those conditions. Fine if you like the look and need a pair to go out. Was surprised that the Levi fabric isn't as tough as it used to be.
3,Well....,"I do believe your thoughts and feelings control your body over anything ""on the outside"" but this author has a lot of typos, she repeats the same old thing, and really doesn't get to the meat of it...I did enjoy the few essays from other people about how they manifested some desires. OK book. I recommend Holographic Universe by Michael Talbot for the more intellectual reader who wants more details."
5,Better than the 1st,Craig & Day-Day make it all work in Rancho Cuchamanga!This one was much better than FridayUncle Elroy is the king!
1,LAME,"I've been using the Firm workouts for over 10 years and still find the classics to be the most challenging and effective. This lower body workout is done strickly on the floor,(despite the picture on the cover) requires little effort and moves at a very slow pace. If you're looking for a workout that will challenge your lower body, this is simply not it."
1,slot machines?...where?,the title starts with slot machines. well there's only ten pictures of slot machines and three are blurry and two are drawings.i went through it in two minutes. don't buy for the slot machine part.
1,Chocolate Memorabilia,We recently purchased this book along with several others from Schiffer for resale in our antique shop. We were very disappointed with this book and would not recommend it to anyone. The book is poorly written and lacks any kind of insight into the history of chocolate companies other than Wilburs. The book misrepresents itself as a book on chocolate memorabilia. There were dozens of chocolate manufacturers during the turn of the century and we would have liked to have seen others represented. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!
5,gorgeous pics & essential baking guide,"I decided to buy this book after flipping through a copy my mother had. I LOVE it! It has beautiful pictures, I would buy this book for the pics alone! The recipes are all yummy (except for the macaron recipe. I'm on the fence about it.) It's a sturdy substantial book and makes a great basic baking book."
5,Excellent resource,Quintessential Martha. Excellent resource book as well as fabulous recipes. Highly recommend this book for all bakers from novice to expert.
4,great recipes/great hints,"great book, the only recommendation is for it to be spiral bound so it is easier to follow recipes and cook."
4,Pound Cake Recipe Error?,"I got this book for Christmas. It's beautiful! I too have been a MS fan forever. But, I made the pound cake recipe, baked as specified, and, when it was supposed to be done, the cake was nowhere close to done! I'll reserve any further criticisms until I try more recipes... I have so much faith in Martha that I'm sure this is the only mistake!"
5,"A good thing, simple and delicious.","This book contains some of the best receipes. I've used so many cookbooks but have never seen one like this.Martha Stewart and her team have created a book not only for beginning bakers but also long time bakers. It includes tips and tricks that will make baking much more simple. Each receipe is EASY, yes easy, and turns out wonderful. There is almost no room to mess up in these recipes, so the end result is beautfiul and delicious. You must try the cakes when you buy the book, they're to die for."
4,Detailed Enough for a New Baker,I had never baked anything except box cupcakes which I iced with can icing before I bought this book. I made cranberry-pistachio biscotti. The best biscotti I have ever eaten. Next up was the parmesan-Rosemary crackers. Both were well worth the effort and looked just like the pictures in the book. Today I am making the blackberry roulade. I would highly recommend this book for anyone new to baking. I cannot speak for those who are experts in baking.
5,Excellent Buy,"Was surprised, but she is a perfectionist and you can't argue with a good recipe. Truly one of the best baking books I have, and will try others of hers because of this one. You can't lose with this, especially if you are cooking for a crowd. The gingersnaps are the best I have made (so says the old man in the rocking chair), and the coffee cake has been made several times in the last year (a no fail recipe - topping is great). You won't lose weight on any of these recipes...:)"
5,Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!,"When I bought this book, I read it from cover to cover. There was so much to learn, without even baking something.I have tried several recipes from the book, so far I haven't found one person who didn't think the brownies were to die for. For the first time ever I baked myself a birthday cake and as fabulous as it looked in the book, it was even better in person.To the person who wrote about the ingredients and not knowing where to get them, my copy of the book has a supplier list at the back, maybe yours does too.This book was worth every penny (even when converted to Australian dollars)."
5,the best!,"I got this for our own household from Borders. We loved 90% of it, so I got one more for a good friend of mine. There is one recipe in there that was awful(the coconut cake) but all the others are amazing. The breads are very good, the cookies...some are delicious, some are OK, I guess it's a matter of taste. The good part about this book, is that it gives important details, that proof to be decisive for the success of the recipe.Buy it, it's a good one, you will not be sorry!!!"
5,Beautiful Book,"I do love this book. I sat down and read it cover to cover, in fact! The photos are the best part, absolutely gorgeous. So far, the recipes I've tried have been excellent. I especially appreciate that recipes note how long items will keep once baked. I wish more cookbooks would include that info since I like to know how long I can expect to keep the food!Overall, this is a thorough book with MANY recipes and truly beautiful (and useful) pictures."
3,Double check ingredients,"I purchased the book based upon ""Ms. Perfect's"" reputation. The first recipe I tried was for Baguettes on page 312. The bread was so salty it had to be thrown out. The recipe indicates 1 1/2 tablespoons of salt. In retrospect I'm sure it should be 1 1/2 teaspoons. I wrote to Martha, thinking she would want to know. (yeah, right). The form letter I got back was about cooking at different altitudes. It was obvious my email had not even been read. What was even more interesting to me was the line (probably in all her form letters) that read,""The recipe is correct"". I wrote the publisher who indicated my letter would be forwarded to the editor. I have heard nothing back. The book looks great and I would assume that the vast majority--maybe even all the other recipes--are correct."
5,A Loss for Words,"There are not words enough to describe how good this book is. It is not just a baking cookbook. This is a baking reference--for me, the new authority on baking. If you want to master pie crusts, pies, cheesecakes, breads, cakes, cookies...even homemade croissants, scones, puff pastry, and on and on, the recipes and techniques are beautifully provided in this book and in many cases with step by step, color photos to help you along. This book is classic Martha Stewart. It is thorough and beautifully presented. Worth every single penny."
5,Indespinsible for the first time baker AND 20 yr baker,"This cookbook conatins all of the standard, time-honored baking items- and EVERYTHING comes out perfectly. Also, Martha gives you ways to change the time-honored recipes just a little. The book is beautiful, clean looking, and, just like Martha, well organized. It should be re-titled ""Martha's Baking Bible-"" and that is my only complaint.There is also a helpful section on different tools used in the recipes."
4,great condition,"the book was in great condition as stated. Took a bit longer than i expected , but it was the holidays so..no complaints. It was a gift for my sister and she loves the book. The quality of the paper is very good and great pics too."
4,Great Cookies,"I haven't tried any of her cake recipes but the cookie recipes are good. Of course, I put my own twist to the recipes and they came out even better! I am very excited about that. I am going to try her brownies and cakes over the weekend. I am looking forward to purchasing her Wedding Cake Book"
5,Wonderful baking book!!,"A wonderful, comprehensive book of baking. Easy to read and follow. A lot of fun just to read. :)"
4,"Quality Book, but not a Favorite","I think this book deserves 5 starts because it is a great cookbook, but I do not ""love it."" The recipes turn out great. No room for complaints about the finished products. However, it does not appeal to my preferences in baking for a number of reasons. (None as a matter of quality, all of personal preference.)"
1,Not a WonderCup and very flimsy,"I had a KitchenArt version of this cup that eventually got warped in the dishwasher. So I thought I'd buy a gen-yu-wine WonderCup. The actual cup that arrived in October doesn't look at all like the picture. It's all white and there's no writing (other than the measurements) on it. In fact, there's no brand name or other identifying mark. I've used it once and now the outer sleeve cannot be made to fit over the inner sleeve. I consider that a failure and today I ordered another KitchenArt. I rely on the cup for measuring molasses, peanut butter, the usual suspects. I just hope the new KitchenArt is as good as the old one. But this one was a gen-yu-wine Dud."
4,Cool watch,"This is a very good watch! I liked its features and design. However my only concern is the watch strap, which may go bad if used in water!Timex should take care of these contrast features!"
4,"Good for the price, but needs a better band","I have used this watch for some time and have no complaints. It is fine for basic timing for sports, including lap counts, timed activities, splits, etc.I do wish the band was a standard watch band. Mine is still intact and seems to be fine, but I'm not sure how to replace it if/when it finally falls apart."
1,to complain,"I have problem with the water , its burry and misty .Timex Men's Ironman 100-Lap FLIX System Watch #T5E261Timex Men's Ironman 100-Lap FLIX System Watch #T5E261"
3,"Nice watch, but the strap???","Like another reviewer said, the strap on this watch leads much to be desired. It is sewn to the watch, so presumably if the strap goes, the watch goes. And since I purchased it to use when I work out/excercise, I wonder how the cloth/velcro will react to sweat over time.Regarding the watch itself, I'm very pleased. The time is displayed VERY LARGE which is kind of comical...but it does the job.EDIT: After about a month of use, the paint is starting to chip/scrape off around the face. And the watch has seen no abuse at all."
3,Cons - Pros,"Things I DO NOT like about this watch.The strap is velcro, which is a plus, but its not a simple strap you have to pull it thru a plastic connector to loop it around to strap it on. This connector is slightly smaller than the velcro and its a pain to get the watch on using one hand, also its a little on the small side but not too small.The timepiece itself is little on the large side than other timex pieces I've owned.The velcro strap is physically sewn into the timepiece, I hope it never breaks you cannot change this strap.The flix system requires you to shake it extensively, I found myself unable to do it comfortable so I wont do it at all.What i DO like about it. The display is extremely easy to read, even at night when you press the indigo. I was able to set this watch up completely the moment I opened it, no manual needed, even tho its included very simple to operate."
3,Needs longer Strap!,"Have had a couple of Timex watches before and since I work in a grocery store, I usually buy fairly inexpensive watches every couple of years that look nice, sporty and have a easy to read face, w/ day/date and alarm clock. Saw the Timex T5E261 and knew that would be my next watch. Arrived from shipper, NY to Sea. in about 7 days after ordering(pretty darn good). Took the watch out of package and looked it over. Loved the watch, but the velcro-strap itself has a bit to be desired. Most annoying thing is, that it takes quite a bit of effort to squeeze/pull the strap over my hand. If I take the strap(loop it through and velcro) all the way apart, it's a hassle to get it back through the loop. Band feels good though after wearing it for a couple of days though. Overall, I'm pleased with my purchase till I have to take it off or put it on. Strap aggravation costs this 2 stars. BTW, I wear mens med. cadet golf gloves if that helps."
4,"Best watch ever, worst strap I've owned","I've worn this watch for a year now and still amazed at the functionality. This is an incredible watch. The alarm even can be set for everyday, weekdays, weekends or once. I would like to be able to put a better strap on it but I can't figure out how to get it off. It may not be replaceable.EDIT: Now it's been almost two years. I had to replace the battery at 1 1/2 years (half than the advertized 3 years). The last 3 months before I replaced the battery the light was so dim it was practically useless.NOTICE: It was IMPOSSIBLE to remove the back without removing the strap as part of the rubber extends over the edges of the cover. And it's very thick, so removing the band proved to be very difficult.Still the functionality of the watch has me still recommending it and I am very hard on watches, getting it dirty while working in the yard, changing oil, washing my hands with it on, etc. It is built very well."
2,second rate,The watch seems second rate as the strap broke after one week and the coating on the face of the watch is peeling off.
3,timex watch,Timex watch is as good or better as the timexes I've purchased for the last 30 years - instructions are easy to follow and so are the functions; night light is an improvement over past models - wrist band is poor - it is difficult to slide the two ends together as the velcro end is too thick to fit through the rectangular eyelet and the band itself is tight around my wrist. I'll replace the band within 6 months.
5,good choice,"This is my third purchase of this model watch. However, it was my first online purchase. Very good experience and I would highly recommend the watch and supplier."
1,Not what it claimed to be,"This watch was a real disappointment. It claims to be a watch built for the active lifestyle but fails to perform. The screen is great and it displays the time pretty well too, I'll give it that, but the watch itself is built for someone with a desk job. The band literally snapped off the watch within 2 days of receiving it, and it never stays on the time either. With any wrist movement it will start shuffling through the modes and then snap off your wrist. It looks to be sturdy in the picture but watch band tie-in is a joke.Horrible watch for $50.00. My advice is take your money elsewhere. This watch is a piece of junk."
3,Less than great.,"I'm sorry, but I didn't think this book lived up to the hype.I don't mind low quality art if the story is there, but the level of art in this comic is particularly low and the story doesn't excuse it. The story is good, but I'd only give it a 3. The whole comic book feels like a rough draft. As though the author had a really good idea, scratched it out fast and sloppy and intended to go back and beef up both story and art, but decided to just publish it as is.I do not think this book as re-read potential. It just wasn't worth what I paid."
5,Great Art Great Story,"I love this book. The art is great on every page. The story will draw one in and keep him intersted all the way to the end, and it's a thick book."
4,"High energy, brilliantly performed fusion.","Once again, the Johannson brothers (Anders and Jens)have put together an enjoyable fusion effort. ""Fission"" contains guest appearances by axe specialists- Shawn Lane and Mike Stern. Stellar mucianship combined with intricate compositions make for a great listen. Standout tracks- ""Hooded Strangers"", Acrostic Shibboleth"" and ""Race Condition""."
2,not very good,"the basics are great but the book is SO vague on anything more than basic. Get one of the ""DUMMIE"" books or something like it."
4,Great Book,Dug out my old AutoCAD 2005 program and needed a refresher course. This book and author did the trick. Great tutorial.
1,Insidious,"What a shame. I was really looking forward to reading this book after reading what the blurb and introduction claimed it was -- a balanced academic history that presents for the first time an unbiased account of Jerusalem's history.Unfortunately, it is anything but that. All of the ""scholars"" come from one perspective and many of the ""facts"" presented are at best misrepresentations of facts. What makes this book so insidious, however, is its very claims to balance and even-handedness. But simply claiming that you are unbiased and balanced does NOT make you such. And just because your scholars come from different countries does not mean that their views are diverse or more universal.If a KKK member wrote a book describing in academic-sounding terms how blacks were inferior, and then wrote a description of the book that described it as well-researched, balanced and even-handed, it would not cease to be a racist book."
5,"A Combination of Tatum, Peterson & Garner","What more can I say about Bernard. I dedicated my book to him!!! I have 10 hours of live performancesof him when he played at the Painted Bride in Philadelphia, PA. His best LP has ""Rondo"" which he composed.The next LP-out of print-is one that has Prelude Fugue and Trio on Lullaby of Birdland!!This CD has a few numbers that are not on any of his previous LP's. Check out ""Formidable"" which is a newCD that has all of his great numbers. Unfortunately, he was not known to many and hardly ever mentionedin any jazz book!!!!Arnie Fox-author of Compendium of Over 2000 Jazz Pianists"
1,disappointing,this isn't a book... it's a pamphlet ... written by someone who is very bitter toward men... it doesn't explain to girls the importance of anything except to be spiteful -- I was embarassed by this book and would not give it to a teenager.
1,Miss-informed,"I was totally misled by the title of the book. I thought this was going to be some red hot advice on how to ""whiteant"" your female friend's current relationship with some other guy and, you know, make her ""your own"". Instead, this is a whole bunch of advice apparently from mother to daughter about how to avoid having sex. Like, what's the deal there?"
1,Weak and misleading,"I am absolutely shocked by the quality of this ""book"". I've seen more informative pamphlets in the pediatrician's office. I was looking for something to provide some insight to a teenage girl, instead I got a weak collection of lines that teenage girls should beware of, followed by way too many blank pages for her own notes. A waste of money."
2,I don't get it...,"I had to read this in 8th grade health class. But what I was wondering the whole time was why doesn't anyone get the GUYS' side of things. I'm a girl and it disturbs me that girls have so many books for them, but guys have little to none. It's not as common, but girlfriends do pressure their boyfriends to have sex too. It's not completely unheard of, people. It's not a bad thing to have virgin boys!Overall, the book was just a disappointment. I wasn't expecting much out of it since I was reading it for school, and wasn't wrong with my judgment either."
3,"Three stars, but some great stuff, and one masterpiece","I got this after hearing ""Around 12:15."" One of my all time favorites. The title song and Yearning for Love, an old Gap Band song if I'm not mistaken, are great too. The rest hasn't yet grabbed me the way those songs do. But I'd buy it just for them.Note: I hate grade inflation. Others would probably give it four stars."
3,Mellow,"I bought this CD for one song ""Yearning For Your Love"". I heard it at a wedding reception and inquired. Anyway, ""Piano in the Dark"" is good and the others are mellow."
1,Institutional,"Thank God I became a huge Alex Bugnon fan AFTER this album. Had I heard this one before the rest, i'd never listened to him again."
3,Good and bad,"The picture quality is very poor, which is almost understandable for One Million BC (aka Man and his Mate in the UK) but less so for the much later Wild Women of Wonga. The former is a reasonable film and Carole Landis is hot. The latter fails on all levels: plot; screenplay; acting; special effects - just occasionally it is so bad it is funny but mainly it is just dire. Mercifully my copy of the DVD started to break up but unfortunately it came back."
5,great product,"This product is ideal for people with dry/damaged/color treated hair. It protects hair from the sun and blow-drying. Since I started using it, I found that I have less breakage and my hair is easier to manage. Pleasant scent."
1,Not what I was expecting,"Well - I cannot say that the product has significantly help my ""uv"" protection for my hair, nor helped with breakage.I can say that the product smells very badly and although the back description uses the words ""detangle"" - it is NOT what-so-ever an aid to detangling. It's smelly water in a bottle.I would never buy this again."
2,not bad but could be much better,"The purpose of having a dual language book is to help learn a language, but the English and Japanese are so different in translation, almost ridiculous, that it is useless for this purpose. Also the print could have been better, the print is too small and only takes up about 10% of the page. They could have made the print larger and easier to read and still have left plenty of space on the pages. Not very well thought out."
2,A kids book that my kids dislike...,"My wife bought this and one other Japanese children's book for our kids for Christmas, and none of my three kids enjoy this book. I will give you that the art is very well drawn, but this is simply not an enjoyable story for a young child. The story makes very little sense to a western 5 year old.I'm not an expert on the Japanese language, by I do have several years of formal training in the language, and there were many parts of the translated story which were very suspect in the translator's word choice and pacing. Artistic license is one thing, this was kinda pushing it.Overall, a book that will be useful to my wife who is currently studying Japanese, but not one my kids enjoy at all, so I feel we could have just as easily bought a random Japanese newspaper subscription for my wife and have been just as well off."
5,Wow!!!!,"Great Writing.Family Affair is the best story I have read in a long time.Give me more by this author,Tracee.this story had everything in it.WOW!!!"
4,Nine by Starr,"Nice, brief selection of early Kay Starr recordings displaying her pop sentiments beautifully. Sound quality it superior on these nine sides. A nice, budget addition to your CD collection"
4,Not bad for one penny,The book is a little out of date but somethings don't change. It had some good common sense information and I couldn't beat the price...
5,A Lifesaver!!,"Very detailed and extremely helpful. Gives Island by Island details of where to visit and wonderful places to eat. I highlighted so much, you would have thought it was printed on yellow and pink paper!! A very good value and a must before you take your trip to the Islands!"
2,How far they fall,"The good news is that this is a hundred times better than the X-Factor. That's not saying much.The bad news is that Janick Gers still flails worthlessly, ""producer"" Steve Harris still hasn't found the knob to turn up the guitars, and Blaze Bayley still hasn't sprouted a pair.A couple of the songs should be OK, but the vocals are ruinous. And the boppy keyboards on ""Angel and the Gambler"" are the most putrid thing I've ever heard. The lyrics aren't that great either. For my money, the best track is Como Estais Amigos, which Gers cowrote.I have no idea why these guys are putzing around like a bunch of weary old men while Dickinson is tearing up like he's still 18 on The Chemical Wedding. Oh, what I wouldn't give for a new IM album produced by Martin ""Not Steve Harris"" Birch."
4,IRON MAIDEN STRIKES AGAIN,"Iron Maiden release a new album, which is very good. Good music and great solo. The lyrics aren't so much awesome, but it's a great job. Blaze Bayley isn't so good as Dickinson, but he is a good singer. FUTUREAL and THE EDUCATED FOOL are SUPERTRACKS and unique. This CD is heavy metal, but not heavy as Powerslave(a weak album) or The Number Of The Beast(a great album). It's worth buying. Buy it!"
5,A great album,"Many people say Blaze Bayley isn't a good vocalist, but I think he fits Maiden's style perfectly. The bonus tracks on this album are well worth the extra money the live versions are great that are bonus tracks are excellent and the rest of the album is great as well."
1,Steve Harris finally found the truth...,"I thought all hope was gone, when I heard Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith returned to Iron Maiden. This CD is the second with awful singer Blaze Bayley, and it has Janick Gers (the man who can't write one really pretty, harmonic or melodic guitar-solo, nor can repeat them twice!!) on guitar also. With this formation, Iron Maiden couldn't get anywhere. It's not their fault, only. The compositions by Harris, with Mi, Re and Do major all the time, are outclassed and boring. Maiden finished after ""Seventh SOn of A Seventh Son"". I hope they come back with their next album."
1,Game Creation - Not Awesome,"The book is fine - but don't buy the book for the CD. The entire CD is almost all trial software. The only full versions are very old, buggy, and a few of them won't install on Windows XP.The book is more a tutorial of the trial software included on the CD than anything else. If your looking for a way to create your first game ever and don't care to go farther than that - this is the book. If your looking for a road to a 'good' game - then go get something else."
3,Not Bad,"This book is pretty good, but as mentioned by another reviewer the software is pretty much out of date now.The book is for anyone who wants to make games without the need to learn how to program. So it's aimed at teens and above. Very simple to get into, and not heavy like all the standard programming language books.If you are interested in this book I would recommend looking at the alternative book - ""Make Amazing Games in Minutes"". The Amazing book carries the latest version of The Games Factory (Version 2 - to be released in 2006),while the Awesome book is running a very old demo version 1.06 (released in 1996). The new version isnt limited to 256 colors like this one.Theres not alot to choose between them, so Amazing comes out the winner, being the newer book and running a newer version of the product."
2,For Six-year olds (with pixelated guns),"Elementary graphics stuff. Beginner material about how games came to be - and are. An acceptable resource for developing 2D games (sans programming), though the 3D part is pretty dated."
2,Only Thomas toy we own that BROKE,"The magnet that is suppose to pull the other trains around came out and was unrepairable soon after we purchased it. The magnet is a choking hazard, too. This tow truck does not fit well under the bridges either."
5,Butch the tow truck,"If your child likes playing with Thomas & Friends trains, Butch the tow truck can be used for towing trains and cars back in place whenever they derail. Then the engines can get back to work.I don't know why people are writing bad reviews about Butch's crane arm breaking off. I've had my Butch for 3 years straight and his crane arm has not broken off yet. Because of Butch's durability, I would recommend using him as a good tow truck for your collection."
2,Almost nothing new with fourth edition,"The fourth edition is basically the third edition with a six page addition listing his 13 best choices including a paragraph or two of commentary on each choice and a few ""you might also want to check these"" suggestions. The book does have some useful general suggestions if this is your first time for buying a used car. If you are looking for specific models to buy, go to your local library and copy the last six pages."
4,Fighting the good fight in a losing battle,"Readers familiar with Nichol's other works might be surprised by On The Mesa. The book differs from anything he's published in the past and more nearly resembles the reflections of writers better known for non-fiction works than for fiction.On The Mesa is the story of one of the skirmishes in the long war over the encroachments of 'post-modern' civilization into Northern New Mexico. Those battles are usually portrayed best in fiction works because they constitute an epic. Bradford's books, Red Sky at Morning and So Far From Heaven are two of the first of this genre, followed by the several Milagro Beanfield novels by Nichols.On The Mesa lacks the penetrating humor readers find attractive in the fiction books by Nichols, but they'll probably be pleased by the reverence, the maturity of tone and the underlying sweet melancholy recognition of an inevitable loss in a noble fight to preserve a facet of the past."
3,A Quotable Carnival Indeed,"A fun grab-bag of quotes, not especially rigorously sourced or verified. Rosten quotes himself more than is seemly, but ""He that tooteth not his own horn, the same shall go untootethed."" A fine souvenir of the mensch who popularized Yiddish culture in America. Hours of fun & sharing guaranteed."
5,Good product ... Great shipping!,"A week before Christmas my mother-in-law told us how much she wanted a New England Patriots jacket. Not being in a position to spend another $100 or so we checked on Amazon and found this jacket. I opted for expedited shipping but I was amazed when she got in two days! Mom loves it, she didn't want a real bulky jacket and this one is perfect. She wears it a lot, it has become her lucky jacket. Hey, the Patriots are still in the playoffs aren't they!"
1,80lb Beginner Weight Set,"Pitiful I mean Pitiful. Ordered weight set came in a box with no packing, just 80lbs of weight, no bar or keepers. Scuffed all to purgatory, called customer service said they would send the rest of it right out. Got it, but no keepers again, ended up going to a local sports store to get the keepers. Would not recommend to my enemies"
4,Timex watch quality drops,This is the 4th Timex watch I've purchased and I was a little disappointed in the quality of this watch. My previous watches were exactly like this but I noticed a few things that made me think this one was more cheaply made. The color is a little off (which is no big deal) but the strap (which is what broke on the previous watches)is even more cheaply made. Not a big enough deal to return it but they don't make things like they used to!The delivery was quick and the transaction was smooth.
4,Great,"It was recieved during the time allotted for shipping. The start/stop button was pushed in a little and still is, but works fine."
3,Limited time span,"I have had this watch for about a year. The back light went out in the first three months. Now the whole watch is dropping the time, or the date, or just resetting to midnight on Jan 1. The watch itself is pretty and comfortable, but, I would like to have it work for more than a year."
4,Great - but not what I need.,"It took about a week or so for the watch to arrive and the watch itself looks great. Although, I am returning it because it does not calculate my heartrate as I wanted. I thought it would read my heart rate real time, but instead I must click a few buttons, count my heart rate for ten seconds, then press stop. This is not what I was hoping for. I want to be able to look down and see my heart rate at any moment during my workout."
3,Skip it,I've owned two of the Timex Rush watches & loved them. This one has some small flaws that I dislike.1. The watch band is too long.2. The clasp does not sit flat - it stands up and catches on things.3. It was not programmed for leap year.
5,Awesome watch!,"I love this watch. A great size, especially for women. I have had several over the past 10 years or so because I wear it daily! It has all the features of the pricier watches but is very simple to use and I love the pre-set countdown timers for helping me keep track of my time. Very comfortable watch to wear. One reviewer mentioned a too long band, but I have small wrists and the tab on the band holds the extra length of the band just fine. It lies smooth and comfortable and I hardly know I am wearing it. Durable too."
2,Timex sports watch died,"This watch performed well and is a cool, sleek watch, but it died within one month, I will try to get a replacement battery for it, but I shouldn't have to."
1,Timex watch purchased through amazon.com,"I thought this has been a good experience, but the first time my daughter wore the watch into the water (supposedly water resistant to 50 m) water appeared under the chrystal. Was the watch not really a Timex? Was it jsut defective? I am now trying to figure out, ""what now?"". Frustrating!!"
4,Easy to use running watch,"Intuitive buttons and functions. Very lightweight and perfect for running. The band needed to be worn in a bit because the shape was a little uncomfortable at first, but after several weeks it feels fine."
1,Not really waterproof,"This would be a great watch, if it actually was waterproof. As it states on the display, it is supposed to be water resistant to 50 meters. However, it is not. I swam with the watch a few times, and after about the third time, water got in the display to the point where I cannot see the numbers. This is second time this has happened with this model. I contacted Timex, who were no help. I will not buy this again, and I do not recommend purchasing it if you intend to get it wet."
4,Great Practical Motor Control Book!,"I'm currently working on a project developing a vector control application for an AC induction motor. This book has been a great source of practical information regarding motor control. Although it does not give an in-depth derivation of vector control (plenty of other resources for this, i.e. ""Vector Control And Dynamics of AC Drives"" by Novotny and Lipo), it does give a great overview which has been very helpful for me. Where most books on the subject focus on the theory, this book focuses on the practical information. I'd highly recommend this book to anyone that is fairly new to motor control, and it would probably serve as a great reference to seasoned motor experts as well. Great Book!"
3,"All Right, Not Great",I guess they didn't have that many hits! There are only 2-3 great songs on this CD.
4,Worth a try,I had serious doubts about trying this with our 6 month old daughter. I had been getting up 3 times a night with her and the doctor suggested letting her cry it out. I just couldn't do that so we decided to give this a try. In just a couple of night there was a huge improvement. I am amazed at how quickly we are seeing results. This is DEFINITELY worth trying.
1,Yet another Cry it Out advocate,"An exact quote from the video says it all: ""She will never learn to fall asleep unless you let her cry."" I can give you the advice of the video in three sentences: Put your baby in her crib. Let her cry. She'll eventually fall asleep. Not advice I'm willing to take. Very disappointing."
1,Video goes against every parental instict!,"The other reviewer on here got it exactly right, This video just tells you to let your baby cry it out and then they will sleep. My wife an I thought this video would be informative but the statements the ""expert"" makes in the video go against every instict that a parent has to pick up their baby when they cry. Don't waste your money. Parents are the real experts of their babies. Trust your insticts and your baby's cries."
1,"Read Ferber's ""Solving your Child's Sleep Problems"" instead",I found this to be a very simplistic video that left me with lots of unanswered questions. Ferber's book is more complete and uses the same approach. END
5,This Book Launched My Career As A Consultant,"If it wasn't for Dr. Jeffrey Lant, I wouldn't have been able to launch my own business... 20+ years ago. His book was instrumental in starting and running my consultancy, especially over those first few months of difficult transition from corporate employment. Kudo's to Lant and mega-thank you's!"
2,"false advertising, can size is not correct","the product is a good product, however the advertising of the size of the can's is not correct. The can size is acually 18 OZ not 24OZ as stated in the ad. Price of product has gone up and size( amount of product ) has gone down. False Advertising."
1,airtight tea cannister,"Too, too small and not worth the price + shipping. Didn't hold a full box of tea."
4,Stainless steel is the way to go.,"I have used an aluminum Bialetti pot for several years, but grew tired of how grungy it became. The stainless steel pots stay much cleaner. You could probably run it through the dishwasher, though the directions call for only rinsing with plain water.Looks good, works well."
2,Julia Quinn should have written all the stories.,"Plot descriptions on this book's Amazon.com page. I disagree with the reviewer from Redwood City, CA. The only story that was really good was Ms. Quinn's and it wasn't long enough. Mia Ryan's story was slightly unusual but I couldn't warm up to the heroine. As far as the other two stories, same old, same old. There was something missing, I just can't put my finger on what, just that I was disappointed."
4,Fairly good for an anthology,I'm a big Julia Quinn fan. Liked the Lady Whistledown series. Thought the four books were fairly good. They were an easy read.
3,kind of boring.....,"I think each of the authors do better writing when they have time to develop their characters. The stories were kind of vanilla, not that exciting."
1,georgette heyer fans beware!,"I was tempted to read this thinking I might find something similer to Georgette Heyer, considering this novel boasted being a ""regency romance""I was instead shocked, not only because it comes no where close to the quality of Georgette Heyers work, but also because this is no different then the other trashy steamy romance novels that talk about explict sex instead of romance. Only imagine that in a stiff and formal era these novels are supposed to be set in, the main male and female charecters manage to have sex while they are courting (sheesh!). Georgette Heyer would turn in her grave!Perhaps these esteemed(..?) writers should devote some time to studying the era they claim to be writing about. Unless you like trashy novels, stay as far from this as you can!Neither in vocabulary nor taste is this book even close to being a quality read. Would not recomend this to anyone!"
3,A little to short,"I have loved all of the Bridgerton books by Julia Quinn and was anxiously awaiting this anthology, but I ended up slightly disappointed. Don't get me wrong .. the stories were good, they had some great ideas for a plot, but were in my opinion way too short. I usually stay away from books like this because it seems just as you are getting into the story ... it ends. I think each of the short stories in here would have made great full length books. Oh well. All in all though if you like books with short stories ... this is a great read. They are interwoven perfectly through the use of the column and are all in all a fun read."
1,great book for high school students,"I took the FE exam in April 2000. I used this book to study for the afternoon electrical exam. I felt confident because I understood all the problems in this book. Unfortunately, only 1 or 2 of the 60 problems in the afternoon exam were addressed in this book. Luckily I did well on the morning exam and I passed.This book did not prepare me whatsoever for the exam because it did not cover relevant information such as boolean algebra, FETs, and modulation equations. Spend some money and get a better book."
2,"Not worthless, but not much help","This book gives a collection of assorted problems from the Electrical/Computer Engineering curriculum. I took and passed the exam this past October (2008) after graduating in May of 2007. I can't honestly say this book helped me a ton, though; I see it as good to look at in 2 scenarios:1. Work the problems FIRST, then you will have some idea as to what you need to extensively review.2. Work the problems as a sort of mock afternoon exam, a week before your for-real F.E. exam. It will get you in that test-taking mindset.Unfortunately, there are quite a few errors I noticed in the book, and even without the errors, this book is by no means a ""good"" review of 4 years of ECE studies.I can't say this book is 100% worthless, but I hope you still have your textbooks."
3,cute,"This is a cute product, it just doesn't look like the picture that is up (the picture is of the full sized one, not the mini). less spaces for fish to swim through and they've got to be tetra-ish sized"
4,Hard to use,I was able to clean the sensor on my d-70 I wish it was sized for each model . I used 4 swabs.but it is now spot free. I will be sending my camera out for a cleaning at a camera store. I bought a second body and now don't change lenses. If the swabs fit better I would have rated a 5
5,When the Right Words Won't Come....,"Often in a difficult situation such as divorce or infertility or with elderly parents or any type of loss, the right words don't seem to be there. You are trying to write a brief note and have nothing to say. What do you do? You want to reach out to this friend or neighbor or family member but you are stuck.Here's the perfect reference tool. Get this book and have it on your shelf for these types of situations. Everyone needs a copy of Lauren Briggs' book. She will help you know what to do--and what not to do in these key situations of life.I highly recommend this book."
5,"I certainly recommend ""The Art of Helping"" by Lauren Littauer Briggs","I heard about this book on the radio. I decided to purchase this book because I knew it would be helpful in the volunteer work I do for our Health Ministry team of our church. Part of the title is, ""what to say and do when someone is hurting."" Because I found this book to be so helpful I have recommended it to many. Our parish nurse purchased some as a gift to the women serving on the committee. I have also shared it as gifts. It is outstanding. Thank you Lauren Briggs for writing it."
2,Steam Powered SIN,"Get this: you get the original game but it can only be played by activating it through Valve's tribute to intrusive software, Steam. The funny thing is that the original game can be played without having to mess with that garbage (if you have the original SIN CDs; I do). So what piracy of SIn is Steam trying to prevent?Steam is simply spyware, I disable it as soon as I get Emergence launched.The Emergence game CD will not install properly if you have older versions of Steam installed in a custom location on your computer. Re-install this spyware before installing SIN, if you really want to play this game.Emergence will crash the first couple of times you try to run it; and will continue if your video card drivers have not been updated recently.Personally, I am sick and tired of having to check in with Valve every time I want to play one of their games. These crazy control freaks at Valve are ruining the computer gaming industry."
4,Preplay-review revised,"I haven't played this game yet, but from everything that I've seen I want to. I am writing this in reply to one of the others writing a review, and to let someone who wants this and decides not to get it because of their review. He said is was short and had a weird ending. Thats because it's not the ending. If you notice it's call Sin Episodes. There are going to be about seven of them. What's great is that, if you get injured, it will carry over to the next one. If you haven't deleted you save games."
2,Just A Good Budget Shooter,"This isn't really a review, but a warning to parents. Do not let your child download the tweak that allows you to see the female characters in the game nude. There are no sex scenes in the game like GTA4, but beware. Otherwise this is a good game."
3,If you are a fan of the origional.....,Origional ideas at work here if i didn't play HL2 first....PLUS:1. survival/arena mode2. origional idea in how/what you get health with3. evolving AI to your play style with variable scale difficulty setting4. uses the source engine5. interesting way of achieving bullet-time6. interactive enviroment7. Comes with the origional SiN for the whole experienceNEGATIVE:1. ONLY 3 WEAPONS IN THE WHOLE GAME!2. needs ALOT more cinimatic experiences3. needs more interaction with enviroment4. same 'ol FPS stuff5. cheap AI in some cases6. stole some stuff from HL27. Blade doesn't talk as much in SiN:E as the first SiNI would have gave it a 5 if it was a budget title.
1,wast,"Small decals no need for them, looked like full size decals when side was shown I was thinking 1 decal I needed them for a stock car not I got stickers for my kids to put on things"
2,NOT like the photo,"Although the wig came promptly, it was not at all like the photo: the hair color was much darker, longer and curlier. There is a heart jewel but it really isn't visible against the hair. This wig looks very much like the glamor long wig. Disappointing!"
3,3 and 1/2 Stars,"This is Spielberg's novel version of his more famous movie. It's not a bad book but, being Spielberg, it reads more like a movie screenplay than an actual novel. It's not that the writing is dry or boring (it's actually quite well-written and captivating in spots), but it doesn't go into extreme detail on some of the more mysterious and awe-inspiring scenes, as good science fiction invariably does. Of course, this was reconciled in the movie where you could actually SEE what is merely being described in this book. Still, this is a fun book, and I reccommend it to you for a rainy day or something of the kind. It's nice, quick read that you'll enjoy."
3,A Mixed Bag,"Steven Spielberg's novelization of his groundbreaking movie is a bit uneven. It's impossible to know whether the book was entirely written by Spielberg himself, or whether it was partially or totally ghost-written. The writing is very good in spots, such as the depiction of Roy Neary's obsession and its effect on his family. In other places it reads more like a movie script, or even a treatment. There are a few instances where there is a little extra background informantion that is not in the movie. Unfortunately, the grandeur and scope of the climactic final scene does not come off anywhere near as powerfully as it does in the movie."
1,The new version is terrible!,"I just bought a case of the ""new & improved"" mini munchies and they are horrible! The original munchies were just mini rice cakes and I loved them. Now they have changed and added corn and puffed the rice and I call them puff maggots because they are puffy and tasteless and gross. Don't buy these. You will hate them! If I could give them 0 stars I would."
2,no help or support from help/support desk,"I purchased this software CD based upon Amazon reviews. The application loaded correctly and everything appeared to work until i attempted to run the live update. I found out that the product was not registered on their server. I twice contacted their help-desk (ANNE) via their web site. I twice responded via email to the questions/response they requested. I then contacted their help-desk again via their web site requesting their help in getting this product to run the updates. No help what so ever since then I can connect to their servers 66.192.12.30 (http(80)zerospyware.com) and (68.82.4.8, domain(53)) but then get kicked off and disconnected. Until they fix their help and support desk which they crow about, this product is not worth the purchase price. I have been unable to fully test it to see if it really works. recommend buying some other product."
1,Does not detect spyware properly,"Beware that this program actually does not detect spywares effectively. I have been using this software for 3 months and set it to autoscan daily. The reports showed that my PC was clean without any spyware everytime. However, when I recheck my PC with Spy Sweeper, I found several spyware programs(including a notorious one which logs my keystrokes) that Zero Spyware never caught."
2,Different recipe? This soup is not the same.,"Having enjoyed several other ""Chicken Soup"" books my daughter & I were disappointed in this volume. Not all of the entries are personal anecdotes from people. The ones that are, are not that interesting. I would not recommend this particular volume to anyone."
2,Disappointing.,"Okay, I'm a sucker for a good sob story that pulls at the heartstrings. Unfortunately, this didn't do it. I own many of the Chicken Soup books and this one in particular had the potential for hitting the zenith of Chicken-Soup-ish-ness. But the stories seemed fake, not particularly heartwarming, and contrived."
5,SO GOOD,AGAIN DON PENDLETON DID A TREMENDOUS JOB IN THIS SERIES AND AS I CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR #23 THE PERSHING GAME FOR COMPLETE SET OF STONY MAN LOVE IT!
1,Girl Interrupted,"Adolescent ramblings of a 30 something woman. I can't imagine this book providing insight to anyone. One thing that is obvious, is that this woman needs to start taking responsibility for herself, and stop blaming her adoptive parents, her birth mother, the school, the Hospital, etc. It will probably take a chunk of therapy. This woman has issues! This in not your typical adoptee."
5,Book Jacket Comments,"Clear-eyed and knowledgeable, John Gerdy demonstrates that sports has become an American Frankenstein's monster, far removed from its origins and corrupting every level of society it touches. You could not have a better guide to the world of sports in this country, or to the overwhelming need for its reform.--Hodding Carter IIIPresident and Chief Executive Officer, John S. and James L. Knight Foundation"
3,"Okay, others in the series are better","Plenty of okay designs here, but I have found other books in this annual series with more interesting and beautiful designs. The dragon design for Chinese New Year is a European rather than a Chinese dragon; not good. There is a fine Jesus and the Children design for Christian stitchers. Also a nice landscape for Father's Day and bird design for May Day. I haven't seen all the volumes, but prefer 1989 and 1990 to this one. Try to get a look before buying."
5,Useful in Academic Settings,"I've used this book when teaching a human-computer interaction (HCI) course in an engineering psychology program. While there are two extensive texts on HCI I found their emphasis too much on the engineering side. Bailey, while including good technical material, also provides a perspective that fits well with engineering psychology. His information combines well with that in books by Wickens.Bailey's material goes well beyond PC issues and provides good understanding of various system design techniques. For exampe, his descriptions of ATM system design gives good direction on how to do design. He provides a good foundation on such important topics as human limits, human senses, memory, usability assessment, task analysis and ways to help people work better.While this book isn't cheap, it is worth every penny (or kronor).It is on my shelf."
3,"Avoids cheese, did you say?","I'm sorry, did I read a comment here that describes Pseudo Echo as having ""[avoided] cheese""?As far as I know, Pseudo Echo is nothing _but_ cheese. Yes, enjoyable cheese, in a retro-camp sort of way, but cheese nonetheless. And I'm still awaiting the reissue of their debut album ""Autumnal Park"" (or simply ""Pseudo Echo,"" here in the US), which is the most enjoyable of their three albums. It's quite faithful to, and almost singularly representative of, the wiry new-wave synthesized stuff of the early to mid-eighties, which, at this point, is more dated than any music from any other era; the kind of music that evokes visions of pink mohawk spikes, subway graffiti, and leather jackets on girls. Sadly, Pseudo Echo's two latter albums are complete garbage, particularly ""Race,"" which is one of the worst albums of the '80s (in which the band infamously apes Van Halen in the worst way)."
3,A nice read,This book is quite interesting as it explores the influence of the press on those living public lives. Sometimes I felt that the writer had a little too much sympathy for the people in the spotlight and therefore pointing a finger at the press. But over all the book was very enjoyable in the way it explores a relationships from the beginning and through hard times.
2,"Neither cold not hot, but lukewarm..","I had high hopes for this book when I saw it in a bookstore. But it is largely disappointing -- the author simply doesn't muster enough intellect when he compares Christianity to Zen Buddhism and finds them similar. Sometimes he is writing a memoir, sometimes a comparative study, and sometimes a religious history: mostly he just points out superficial similarities in the Zen Buddhist and Christian (here Catholic and Orthodox) traditions. He seems more of a Zen student, with his faith in human perfectibiity through meditation, than a Christian of any sort, and most of his history is speculation."
2,"Great tunes, lousy setting","Chicago's earlier albums were full of songs that probably changed the face of pop music forever, and some of those great songs are here.This album does two horrible things to the songs, though. First, it strips the songs out of their environment - the first several albums, at least, were complete works; as terrific as they are on their own, the songs work even better as part of the original whole.Second, this album contains eggregious edits to wonderful songs. Screamin' horn intros, interesting bridges disappear and radio-friendly three minute versions of wonderful 5 minute songs appear.This is a good album for someone who needs an introduction to Chicago. For someone who's a real fan, though, it's a disappointment."
4,All The Chicago Anyone Would Ever Need,"This is the real, honest to goodness Chicago, before the Peter Cetera pop 80's power ballads turned the group into a national sellout.This is the Chicago that I remember hearing as a kid on the radio, and I still love listening to these 11 songs.If you're curious as to the other material that is on the albums that these songs that make up the first Chicago's Greatest Hits Album, which are Chicago Transit Authority, Chicago II, Chicago V, Chicago VI, Chicago VII and Chicago VIII, it is best to save your money. Chicago's albums are okay at best. Chicago III and Chicago IV are not on this greatest hits album, because these are live albums, and from the reviews I've seen they're not very good. It was these 11 pop songs on this greatest hits album that are Chicago."
3,chicago 69-74,"some good early hits. price was good. got a little too "" poppy"" later on in their career for me. It's OK"
5,Best of the Greatest Hits Series,"Personally, I feel that this is the strongest one of all the Chicago Greatesy Hits albums(exclude the Heart of Chicago ones). ""25 or 6 to 4"", ""Beginning"", and ""Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?"" keep coming at you , hit after hit, and this album is definitely full and contains plenty of magnificent music. One of the origins for those who wish to try out Chicago music."
5,The whole album is familiar,"I've always liked the Chicago sound but never before had bought an album. Every song on this album is well known, unlike other ""greatest hits"" albums where you know perhaps 1/4 of the songs. Highly recommended."
4,Pretty good selection,"Having grown up in the 60 - 70's with this band, there is obviously nothing new or improved about the selections contained in this compilation. I pretty much purchased this CD just to have some Chicago music around should I care to listen.As with a lot of music from decades past, this is not something I will listen to very often because of the ""burn out"" factor of hearing the songs so many times over the years. However, if someone were looking for a good cross section of Chicago hits, this would be the CD to purchase.Chicago is definately a ""superband"" worthy of distinction even if over-played."
5,Willllberrrtttt,"If you are reading this, then I am shocked. If you are like me, and have a kid that is Thomas crazy...then you really don't have choice when it comes to this engine. If your kid asks santa for a wooden wilbert...what other option do you have? This one is made as well as all the other wooden series trains.Come on...Wilbert? If you are buying this one, your kid has way to many Thomas trains already. Wilbert is pretty low on the Thomas food chain. Of course, we are running out of Thomas train options, as we have gotten every other one.All of that being said, after we got this train...my kid stopped playing with Thomas stuff. Yes, I blame Wilbert."
3,Let me cry,"The first song I heard from this cd was Freed from desire. And I liked it. But when I heard Let A Boy Cry I concinved myself that I had to have this cd. So, where did I found it. Right here in amazon.com. The lyrics are very rich, and the strange but beautiful voice of Gala makes this a awesome dance album."
4,Nice CD,"I have heard the voice of this beautiful lady about 3 years ago, in one of the commercials I watched. I was so into it, so searched hard to find out who she was. At last I managed to buy her cd, It is a very dance album, with manupulating lyrics influencing the listener deeply. Cool beats and sound, they attract you at the first time. If you like dance albums, this one is a definetly must buy one."
5,the greatest dance song ever!!,If you ever been to a club especially in terceira then you know this song is off the hook...the beat is fast and it makes you want to groove!!
2,"other than the title story, it is pretty boring",the title story is awesome. my daughter loves it. but she has no interest in the other stories. they are boring.
2,Not impressed,I bought this to for my 2 kids and my neice and neph (all under 4) They really liked the book (so do I). The movie was boring and they don't watch it. The books are worth every penny the movie is not.
2,My two year old son did not like it,"Just that, He did not like it, He prefferes Cat in the Hat, Dora the explorer and little Einsteins, maybe a little young for this staff"
2,Does NOT include Trashy Town,"I bought this as a replacement to another Scholastic Treasures DVD which included Chicka Chicka Boom Boom and Trashy Town. The DVDs I received did not include Trashy Town. Although my son enjoys all the books on these DVDs, the one we were really purchasing this for was Trashy Town. We were disappointed the DVD was not the same as the original one we had. Following is a list of the titles on each DVD:Chicka Chicka Boom Boom1. Chicka Chicka Boom boom2. Five Creatures3. Wild About Books4. Inch by Inch5. Blueberries for Sal6. A Story, A Story7. Millions of CatsChicka Chicka 1-2-31. Chicka Chicka 1, 2, 32. Emily's First 100 Days of School3. How Much is a Million?4. If You Made a Million"
4,Scholastics Dvds are the best!,"I love the Scholastic DVDs and books. They are clean, educational and fun to watch/read. There are no unnecessary evils, bad language - just simple and clean fun. This set is very well thought of and it consists of number of good stories which keeps kids entertaining while educating them. This set and Chrysanthemum Dvds are must haves for your collection."
5,My kids LOVE the Chicka Chicka songs,"I bought this becuase our existing DVD became too scratched up to use.This time around I made a custom DVD with just Chicka Chicka Boom Boom and Chicka Chicka 123 and Alphabet Jungle (from Sesame Street) playing over and over again and all my kids (age 2 to 5) will just watch it forever if we let them.Since reading and math is key and understanding letters and numbers is key to reading and match, this works for us. The more interest they take in letters, the easier it seems for them to learn to read and be excited about reading. Of course having tons of books around and reading with them every night and candy math is probably key as well, but my custom DVD provides a good hour of babysitting when we really need to we get stuff done."
2,Bear in the Big Blue House Vol 3,This volume is my 18 month olds favorite. He always laughs when Treelow is listening to the radio in the first episode. Since my little guy likes to dance it's cute to watch him wiggle with the different styles of music they play. Mom & Dad enjoy it too. Not near as annoying as Barney or the Teletubbies. If you were to buy only one video get this volume. I've gotten some others at the library that he doesn't find as entertaining. When bear zooms in and sniffs him at the beginning of the shows he does the same to us.
2,"Very, very short","If you wish to buy this CD because you want to listen to something inspirational while driving do not buy this. It is 29 minutes long - talking is 14 minutes long, the rest is meditation. I believed I am buying the book on CD but this book would have to have 2 pages only. The message on the CD is also very basic like ""YOU HAVE TO ASK ANGELS TO HELP YOU IF YOU NEED HELP or how Doreen's family manifested their car"". Those are things we all learned when first book from Doreen Virtue hit the market."
3,First time I've heard of the term progression.,"I like her voice. She has a soothing voice for the hypnosis/progression. Overall I like the CD, but other forms of manifestation work better. I recently got Eldon Taylor's ""Self-Hypnosis and Subliminal Technology"" to try hypnosis with another person to see if it would. I listened to the CD first because I'm familiar with his other (subliminal) products - I absolutely HATE his voice, but that's for another review. Doreen has a soothing, nurturing type of voice. It's relaxing. You can really go into a deep trance, but alas this method doesn't work. I've kept it to work with it at another time. I'll revisit this review then.I also like her introduction. At least she explains why and gives an example."
3,needs a do-over and a slow down,"It's time for Doreen to redo this. A do-over! It is way too fast, or maybe my angels are too slow LOL. She will ask a question and right when I start to get a picture, she'll ask another question and it knocks me out of 'receiving'. I have ALL of her guided CD's and they are great, except this one."
4,"Great cassette to use for ""progression""","Doreen explains how to get in touch with our angels on side one and takes us into an excellent ""progression"" meditation on side two. We learn what to be aware of and what to pay attention to. An excellent tape for learning how to appreciate and become familiar with the angels and the valuable lessons they have to share with us."
1,Really bad BD,This program recorded in SD and sound just 2 channels.Most TV programs better quality than this.I have many documentary blu-ray discs and this the worst of all.
3,Big surprise found in disc. A 3D review.,"I borrowed this disc to try out my new Panasonic TC-P65VT50. The disc started and a message popped up on screen. ""3D signal detected"". Nothing is mentioned on the disc that this is a 3D blu-ray. I have never seen a 3D movie in the theater or on TV. I put on my new for 2012 Panasonic 3D glasses and was underwhelmed. I put the TV in THX 3D Cinema mode (which only becomes available when a 3D signal is present).This lightens the screen which is good since the glasses are fairly dark. The 3D effect is subtle. There is a feeling of depth in many of the scenes, but not all. Nothing jumps off the screen, this is not Disney World. 3D adds very little to the enjoyment of the disc.The disc is nice to watch, once. Lots of sea creatures. Beautiful colors. Good music (listened in Logic 7)."
3,PLEASANT BUT PREDICTABLE,"Danielle and her mother are in financial difficulties, they will soon have no home. They have sold all their valuable belongings but there is nothing left. Since their fall from grace, they were also social outcasts. Once they had graced the upper echelons of society, but no more. Even their lingerie business was going downhill.Danielle has requested an appointment with their landlord Rafe Valdez, to ask for extra time, before they are thrown out on the streets. Rafe puts a proposition to Danielle marry him, as he wants an heir. He does not have the blue blooded background that she has, but what he does have is money. Seeing as he is not short, fat, bald and ugly, but tall dark and handsome she of course agrees.This was an okay read but quite predictable. As usual Ms.Bianchin has her trademark crazy ex-lover interfere in the two main protagonists relationship. Although her actions at least livened up what was quite a bland offering."
1,Cloning - alive and well in Bianchin's books,"A friend of mine built houses; he had two blueprints, and basically built the same two houses his whole life, just changing the trim, the color, etc. Bianchin does the same thing.I read one of her books and found it mildly interesting, then stopped in my tracks when I saw her name in the grocery store books section. There was another title, and the blurb described a story exactly like the only one of hers I'd read. I bought it out of insatiable curiosity, and -- it *was* almost the same book. The names had been changed, situations tweaked, but the same story. Like something built from the same blueprint, just given different shutters.This one sounds like another variation on the same blueprint -- heroine in impossible predicament, becomes a prostitute for the noble cause of rescuing a parent... I won't waste any more money on anything by Bianchin. She needs to buy a new blueprint. Or to start cloning something more interesting -- like sheep, or Brad Pitt."
3,the satiric comedy adds a different perspective of English g,Gulliver simply tells us of a satiric view of sixteenth centyury England
1,Attacked by censors...,"This book has been ""attacked by censors""?! I read that ALA lie all the time. yet, nobody has been able to point out a single book that has been CENSORED or BANNED (another ALA con word!) in the US. Yet, books are banned and censored in communist countries daily and no word from librarians, teachers, book critics nor ALA. How interesting... So much for ""censorship""!"
2,meh,"The overt sexism made me cringe - such a different and (thankfully) more tolerant world we live in today! My favorite part were the meteors - all the same size and shape and I would almost bet my next paycheck that they used popcorn for the effect. My second favorite part was where they all had to lean when the ship was turning. The ending? I didn't care enough about the charachters to really care, and that to me is the biggest failing of this movie. Who the actors were didn't matter - anyone could have said the lines."
2,Bad stitching. High price.,"I just recieved my Dust Bee Gone dust mask. I'm dissapointed on the stitching on the mask. It was sewn poorly and the stitching by the nose came undone. For the price you pay for this product, it should come in perfect shape."
3,So-so,"Other than the story about the medusa fountain, I didn't find much to get excited about in this book. The stories are mostly about average people caught up in unusual situations, but with few interesting twists.The writing style is OK, but mostly I felt ""Is that it?"" at the end of each story."
3,Some Funny Lines,"A nice little pick me up about aging, although sometimes it does border on sentimental. Makes for a nice small present for those of us who are aging."
4,Good humor,"Its a nice little book with good humor.I got it for my mother when her health starting declining, she loved it and ordered some for her friends.Definitely irreverent... 8-)"
3,A Lesser Effort,"These guys put on a good, if lowbrow show. They feature guest comedians and have an in house group of very competent musicians who excel at making parody adds and sick songs. A few of them are not even ""sick"". Even so, this is not their best work. Almost all of their work is juvenile (delinquent) in nature but this recording seems more so.There are plenty of laughs on the two disks but they are not as plentiful or as hardy as on most of their other recordings."
5,A real bargain at $20! Beautiful and interesting.,"Haywood's book is not the best of the world history atlasses, but easily the best bargain. For twenty bucks you get a beautiful, large, full-color book, with clear, accurate maps. I might prefer that the text was a bit more general, with fewer obscure historical details--at times, the text is oddly esoteric. Still, the book offers broad brushstrokes about agrigculture, technology, world religions, and empires. I also appreciate the diversity of the discussion: Africa and Asia get a healthy amount of attention, so that the book feels more truly like *world* (and not European) history. I could quibble here and there with parts of the book, but the book is gorgeous, pleasurable, and at the price, this is an outstanding achievement."
5,Absolutely Fantastic!,"This is a terrific gem of a world history atlas. As a history undergraduate, I wanted an atlas that would give me an opprotunity to explore a multitude of historical periods with inpsiring maps and elegant prose. Do not be fooled by the price on this fantastic Atlas, it is worth its weight in gold.The atlas starts with early human history and migration, moves into the prehistorical world, then the ancient world, then the medieval period (my personal specialty), the early modern period, and finally the modern period. The scholarly aptitude utilized in the writing of this atlas is beyond comparision. The maps are vibrant and extremely well-done.Truely, I can not recommend a better book for anyone interested in gleaning an overall view of world (Western, Eastern, and everything in between) history."
5,Good History Atlas that is affordable for anyone,"This History Atlas is probably the best generally available. I find it to be very good as a general overview of history timelines with maps and charts. It doesn't really dig deep; it is the proverbial two miles and two inches deep view of history.For a through understanding a reader should move on to other books. That being said any true student of history needs to have a good overview of things before they can dig into the details. And this good gives a great overview of the major topics. Which is why I would recommend it to people.One group that could really benefit from a book like this, of course, are high school students studying history or social studies or whatever they are calling that class now a day. A provides a way to understand an outline at a glance which is very useful for a student. I know I wish I had something like this book in high school or even college."
1,TOO BIG!!,"The dimensions given for this loveseat cover are WAY off... It is a sofa sized cover in a loveseat bag! I bought this at the store itself, brought it home, and now have to return it because of all of the extra material in this thing!!! Look elsewhere if you want a nice looking slipcover!"
4,Works Well - Great Price,"These are identical to bulbs for which my local hardware store charges 30% more. I wasn't sure about ordering bulbs due to risking breakage, but all arrived well-protected.So far so good!"
1,Miserable failure,"Replaced an equivalent 35W G9 bulb that had lasted 2 years in under-cabinet lighting. Burned out in under a week, down near the root of the evacuated part of the bulb. Won't be buying this brand again."
5,This is a work tool for me,"The headlight comes with both a stretch fabric headband and a rubber helmet band (with suspension hooks to keep it in place). There are two switch settings bright and brighter. I was working in a control space where we were testing a backup generator switchover system -- I was using a small Pelican flashlight which was not adequate for the size of the space when the lights went off. I put on the headband light, turned it on -- good light; I switched it to high power and it provided light for everyone in the workspace. Great light."
5,Awesome...,"This cd rocks!!! That is all that needs to be said. It has it all. Hard rockin' songs like ""Follow You Home"", ""Animal"", ""Next Contestant"", and ""Side Of A Bullet"". Coupled with some really good ballads like ""Photograph"", ""Savin' Me"", ""Far Away"", and ""If Everyone Cared"". It took a while for Nickelback to grow on me, but with this album it shows that they are one awesome band.There is not a bad song on this album. Go buy it and enjoy!"
3,Good effort but too much more of the same.,"I am a NB fan. Have been from the first time I heard one of thier songs. This latest release has a few really good tunes on it. There is no deviation from previous NB releases. No experimentation. I find that I listen to about 3 of the tracks the rest sounding a bit too much like the last NB CD. If you are an NB die hard fan you want this CD. If you are a casual fan this is not the CD for you. Nothing with the power of ""How you remind me"".""Rockstar"" is cute and alot of folks will relate.""Follow your home"" has a good groove to it.""Fight for all the right reasons"" is well worth listening too.""If everyone cared"" has the catchiest hooks and is a hit waiting to happen.""Savin me"" is a really good tune as well. A bit too much like previous NB releases musically but I liked it quite a bit anyway.The rest did not impress me but was not unpleasent on the ears."
4,All the right reasons,"Been listening to Nickelback more and more lately. Two of the best tracks seem to be ""Photograph"" and ""Far Away"". ""Fight for all the wrong reasons"" has a solid beat. ""Rockstar"" is a rocker about what it takes to be a rock star, well written and catchy. ""Savin' Me"" and ""If Everyone Cared"" provide a great finish."
4,"Out of my normal buying realm, but good.",Photograph introduced me to this band. My taste generally runs to Michael Buble or Norah Jones but this cd is fun and I'm enjoying it a great deal.
5,Before this I wasn't even a Nickelback fan,"Until I heard photograph I wouldnt have called myself a Nickelback fan, sure I had liked a few of their songs but not enough to buy a cd, but this is definately one to buy their are several very good songs but in my opinion the very best is PHOTOGRAPH and that song alone makes this cd worth buying"
2,Sugary Country Rock,"I've listened to this album a couple of times now, and there's only one song I believe has staying power - that is ""Photograph"". The rest are either melodramatic, sappy or Nickelback songs I've already heard before. I'll admit I got a rise out of ""Next Contestant"" for the first few listens (I thought it might be another steller track like ""Do this anymore"" on the last album), but the sugar buzz quickly turns to a hangover.Sorry, but you'll find no substance here."
1,nickelbad,"nickelback is caricatural of what is american rock now, pretty cd cover, pretty face, good musicians, but theres is nothing inside , songs are horrible , i'm sure that i can find better riffs, this album is bad bad bad..."
1,Who Are You?,"If you own this album I think you need to ask yourself who you are and what your purpose in life is. Currently, the answer to both questions is probobly 'I haven't the slightest idea'."
1,No way.,"These guys are crazy. They're like ""Now yeah see me, now ya don't""And then your like ""Sweet.""And then here they are again.And you're like, ""Oh no, here comes Nickleback doing the same thing...good old Nickleback.""And it's the worst.The worst is when you are forced, becasue of friends, to go to a bar.And you're like ""I just wanna get outta here becasue they are playing Nickleback.""4th Wave Grunge is so bad.But people love it.But then again, look at people. They are fat and dumb and smelly.I guess Nickleback is an ""American Band""Eventhough they are from Canada.My question: Can you be a tough guy and listen to Nickleback?No.But that is the main reason why people listen to it.Dude.Led Zepplein is still sold in stores. If you want the same old good rock and roll...Please call your local record store and file a complaint against Nickleback...We have an election coming up in 2 years and we can't let NaSS Car Nation win again.Stop the hurt."
4,Good tunes,"I've listened to this several times, as well as an older Nickelback. I think this one's better. The earlier one I've heard is harder rock. This one's more my taste - a mix of rock/ballad stuff. Great sounds."
4,Awesome CD!,"I was really impressed with this CD. My favorite songs are Photograph, Savin' Me, and Far Away. These songs are really well done, along with several other Nickelback songs on previous CDs. I'd really recommend ""All the right reasons"" - even if you've never heard of Nickelback, they did a nice job on this and it's worth a listen or two :)"
1,"Typical ""Vanilla"" Rock band","Nickelback has taken people by storm, and even though they write radio friendly pop rock, there are 100 bands that are on the pop charts that are better then these guys. First off, they sound like a total rip off of Creed, which already gives them 2 Strikes, second off, the musicanship is horrid, and the only good thing is there is a solo done by ""Dimebag Darell"" which was sent in by Vinnie Paul, for the band to use. Even though I will admit, they do write some catchy tunes, its something that we have all heard a million times before, and like most of these flash in the pan bands, they will be long forgot in a few years. I really cant recomend this band to anyone, except maybe to teens and younger, that want some real simple rock, otherwise its just awful"
1,Poor album,"not what i expected, i should return it, these 1 hit albums could become the death of album buying for many !"
2,all the wrong reasons,"All the right reasons nickelback now first things first I did not know anyhting about nickelback until one of my friends told me to listen to rockstar a very good song by the way I did not expect much but I heard that all the right reasons was n't anything you wanted to listen to. To be honest I don't think that chad kroeger is an amazing lyricist anyways I found 4 out of 11 songs very likable Rockstar, Savin me, If Everyone Cared, and Next Contestant I gave it 2 stars but I think it deseves two and a half I mean other than those four songs I thought it consisted of depressing lyrics and a lyricist that was not meant to be singing It was good that I only borrowed it ."
5,This cd rocks,"wow!! this cd is fab. all 11 songs are great... topnotch. my favorites have to be nickelback's slower songs like Photograph, Far Away, If Everone Cared, and Savin' Me. Rockstar is probably my most favorite song just because it has a different sound....everyone should buy this cd if they even barely like Nickelbacks sound. It is probably their best cd right now."
1,garbage..,"How anyone can rate this music any higher than a 1 (not even worth that!) has got serious issues with taste. If you want some serious rock check out The Tea Party and for god's sake, stop listening to the radio! Go out and find music that Clear Channel doesn't approve of!The band Porcupine Tree said it best with their song The Sound of Muzak:""Hear the sound of musicDrifting in the aislesElevator prozacStretching on for milesThe music of the futureWill not entertainIt's only meant to repressAnd neutralise your brainSoul gets squeezed outEdges get bluntDemographicGives what you wantNow the sound of musicComes in silver pillsEngineered to suit youBuilding cheaper thrillsThe music of rebellionMakes you wanna rageBut it's made by millionairesWho are nearly twice your ageOne of the wonders of the world is going downIt's going down I knowIt's one of the blunders of the world that no-one caresNo-one cares enough"""
3,"Ok, but not for everybody","I liked a few songs on this CD but, there was too much hard rock that I didn't enjoy and the song selections didn't transition smoothly. Good for some, not for me."
1,Bland.,"The trouble with Nickelback is that they're too apprehensive and catering. You want a preachy ballad? No problem. You want a more teary-eyed ballad meant to be played at high school graduations? Nickelback delivers that too. A standard hard rock track? They have that as well, they just colored it as a Dimebag tribute. ""Rockstar"" unpredictably satirizes the ""rockstar mentality."" You know, as opposed to Nickelback actually being rich rock stars. Nickelback is spoon-fed emotion, and they represent a gaping void in radio rock where there used to be a soul.- Thus says the Pellington"
5,NICKELBACK ROCKS!,"TO THE REVIEW TITLED ""ALMOST HURLED"", HURL UNTIL YOU FEEL BETTER THEN BECAUSE I BOUGHT THEIR ALBUM FOR 3 SONGS AND ENDED UP LOVING THE ENTIRE CD. I ORIGINALLY BOUGHT IT FOR 1.) SAVING ME 2.) FARAWAY AND 3.) ROCKSTAR AND NOW I LISTEN TO ALL THE SONGS. MY NEXT FAVORITES HAVE BECOME ""FIGHT FOR ALL THE WRONG REASONS"" AND ""ANIMALS"". I'M USUALLY NOT ONE TO LISTEN TO HARD ROCK BUT NICKELBACK IS THE EXCEPTION. NICELY DONE GUYS! OTHER SONGS I ENJOY BY THEM ON DIFFERENT ALBUMS ARE SOMEDAY AND HOW YOU REMIND ME. IF THEY HAD A #1s ALBUM WITH ALL THE SONGS I LOVE, I WOULD'VE BOUGHT THAT FIRST. ANYWAYS, EXCELLENT!!"
3,Review,"The case of CD was not in the condition it was noted the case was cracked and the case does not seal closed as the tabs were broken,"
5,Their best ever!!!,"If you like Nickelback, you'll love this one... every song is solid, solid, solid. You will NOT be disappointed!"
5,Fantastic,"I loved this CD. I just think it's funny how Nickelback can connect perfectly with girls' PMSing moods. You know wut i'm talking about ladies! You get tired for all ur damn cramps take time and listen the the soothing Savin' Me or Far Away. Then if your pissed as hell, you can take it out with Fight for all the Wrong Reasons and Side of a bullet. Then when ur really horny u can listen to Animals and Next contestant.As far as the poor reviews on this page i just have to say that of course the songs are nasty and tasteless. Wut the hell do u think rap is? At least this guy actually has a GIRLFRIEND and not just some chick he found on the street like almost all of the popular rap songs today. So if you don't like Nickelback's style, then shove it.Overall i love this CD and i'm totally ready to rock out at their concert!"
2,This New Album Was Dissapointing To Me,"Wow. I don't really know what to say about this album. I have to say that I was very dissapointed. I went out and bought this CD the week it came out so I could save a little money because I knew it was going to rock, but boy was I wrong. Variety is something that I look for in a band and the band certainly lacks this on this album. Dont get me wrong, I am a Nickelback fan, just not of this album. One of the songs sounded like country to me(Rockstar), what in the world?? Some of their songs off their new cd are cool but yet they sound like songs off the previous album; this isnt good at all. So if you like listening to the same thing over and over by a band then go ahead and buy this cd. If you dont, then i wouldnt recommend this cd at all."
4,There's the Nickelback I know,"After the enormously disappointing ""The Long Road,"" I was ready to turn my back on Nickelback and never look back. When I first heard ""Photograph"" on the radio, I was anticipating another bad album because the single bore a striking resemblance to ""Someday,"" single #1 off of ""The Long Road."" Fortunately, ""Photograph"" sounds nothing like the rest of the album, and it's hard rocking riffs complimented by Kroeger's gritty vocals took me back to the days of ""Silver Side Up."" I was also blown away by the appearance of ZZ Top on ""Follow You Home"" and Dimebag on ""Side of a Bullet."" This is possibly the best Nickelback album to date. Don't be fooled by the radio-friendly vibes of ""Photograph."" Nickelback is still very much a hard rock band."
5,NICKELBACK- NEED I SAY MORE?,ANOTHER AMAZING CD!!! GREAT PRICE WELL WORTH $. EVERY LAST SONG ON THIS CD ROCKS!!!
2,I am so sick of Mainstream Rock,"Two years have passed since the release of Nickelback's The Long Road, and Nickelback has absolutlely nothing to show for it. There newest album uses the same melodies and chessy guitar riffs as they have in the past. Let's face it, the beloved songs, ""How You remind Me,"" ""Someday"", and ""Photograph,"" all sound exactly the same. There newest album seems like they didnt put any effort into it at all. I just dont understand why a band chooses not to mature their sound and lyrics. Front man Chad Kroeger still uses his cheesy, uninspired lyrics. Nickelback isnt the only band that does this. Other bands that do this are, Trapt, Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit, and Theory of a Deadman. I dont even need to describe the album, fans who own Silver Side Up will know what the album sounds like."
2,"""Photograph"" is good, but the rest: pretty awful for the most part","Wow-I can't believe I am the only one not impressed with this CD-but from the looks of the other reviews, I seem to be! With the exception of a few songs, I think this CD is really weak. I forced myself to listen to it in its entirety, and when I got to the song about his stripper girlfriend being groped by other people, I was overcome by the urge to return the CD for a refund. If I hadn't been suckered into buying the CD it would have been funny. Some of these songs are absolutely awful and suffice it to say, I am NOT impressed.I would say about half the songs are ok, but the other half are horrendous. And sorry, but that's not good enough, especially when the songs that are bad are laughably, ridiculously terrible. When I spend my money on a CD, I expect better than this, and it seems like Nickelback should be able to deliver, but they certainly didn't this time."
2,This is horrible!!!!,"Wish they broke up like Creed did.I think nickleback are the worst ""rock"" band right now. Did you see what happened to them at a live show in portugal? LOLAnd btw, yes I've listened to the album like 10 times. Photograph is a good pop song but the rest is really horrible and repetitive."
1,Pretty Sad,"I'm sorry if I offend all of you people who think Nickelback has talent, but I just can't see where. This type of meaningless boring music should be played at the prison camps in Quatanama Bay to inmates for punishment, but it would end up punishing the soldiers way too much plus it would be more inhumane than just about any other tactic. Please save your money and time and check out some real meaningful talented bands."
1,Hey Kiddies!,"Nickelback's got something extreme to offer! That's right, something extremely sh*tty, that is! Canada's answer to Creed has 11 brand new tracks of nausea, and vomiting may be induced, on ""All The Wrong Reasons"". ""Savin' Me"" could possibly be the track that sounds like ""How You Remind Me"" and ""Someday"", which are both the same song, and ""Photograph"" just makes me wanna cut my arm off so I can toss it at the radio. And I thought Creed was bad enough. Nope, Nickelback is the prime reason why you should stop listening to your radio and discover underground music. This works best as either a drink coaster, skeet shot, or a frisbee, and the booklet makes good use as toilet paper.(...)"
1,Horrible Album,"How is the cd ranked a 4 out of 5 stars? I must be the only person that notices that all of their songs sound exactly alike. These guys used to be good and have an edge to them, that is the first two albums of theirs.Now I cant stand it when they come on the radio. Photograph, Rock Star and Saving Me, all are pop songs. Anyone could write those lyrics. Chad Kroeger's voice is also getting really irritating on every album and the guitar playing isnt that great either.I wish they would go back to their old ways and start singing the darker songs they used to be known for. Their last 3 or 4 albums have all been dumbed down radio friendly efforts."
1,Sobrevalorados?,"Nickelback es el grupo más sobrevalorado del mundo, todas las canciones mantienen la misma estructura de sonido y suenan prácticamente igual, ¿y estos señores son multiventas? Yo particularmente prefiero guardar mi dinero para algo mejor que para alimentar a estos pseudomúsicos y a los directivos de su compañía de discos. Un absoluto bluff."
5,All the Right Reasons,All the Right Reasons to order more products from this vendor!...excellent service-no problems! Rec'd in a timely manner and CD in great condition. Thank you!Cynthia
1,AAAAAHHHH!,"Sitting here, reading you guys trying to justify listening to- and actually enjoying- one of THE ABSOLUTE WORST BANDS OF ALL TIME is somewhat funny to me. ""the lyrics are thoughtful and the music is sooo catchy"" bullsh*t. You guys are only cheating yourselves out of good music by wasting time listening to this garbage. Is this band ever going to tire of making songs that sound exactly the same? probably not, since people like you go out and buy this album for yourself and all your friends.. no matter what. Please do yourself a favor and stop supporting this band and not digest everything pop radio throws at you."
1,A Poor Man's Everybody,"Nickelback Musically to me ain't worth a Penny. sounds like another Album of a Poor Man's Creed,Stone Temple Pilot,Pearl jam,etc.... One Lucky Garage,Karoke style Band.the Lyrics,arrangements,instrumentation is Yikes!!!! to me ears. how they are getting over is beyond me."
1,You suck....for all the right reasons,"Ah Nickelback, they're back again, and they've lowered the standard once more (if that was possible). The gem on this album has to be the tune ""Rockstar."" Chad Kroeger singing about being a rockstar is like Mother Theresa bragging about her criminal record."
2,If you like meat and potatoes of rock...,"then you will like this band. It's ok if you do, but you should probably check out some other, more inovative bands. You may like this kind of rock music because this is the best kind of rock you are exposed to, but there are so much more out there that you guys don't even know about. Look into some better music"
5,Great price for a combo!!,I got this cd in a combo pack with Nickelback's new cd Dark Horse. Fast shipping and great price!
5,Nickelback all the right reasons,This is the best CD I have ever bought. I am literally wearing it out. I love every song.
3,"A classic......and hey, chicks dig 'em.","The perfect CD to get your girl into heavier music. Strong hooks, nice melody, and above all....consistant. With Nickelback you always know what you are getting, and I appreciate the consistancy. The new Fozzy CD/DVD All That Remains Reloaded is just as consistant, and has Chris Jericho from the WWE as the singer!!! Check it out after you get this CD, and you'll never take either one out of the CD changer!!"
2,"generic, yes","I tend to agree with a reviewer who described it as ""generic"", or something to that effect. The group sounds like a Soundgarden wanna-be, combined with other sounds that you might hear these days in hard rock, with very little creativity and horrible, I repeat, horrible poetry. I suppose this is heavy metal for the masses, just going through the motions with not much else happening. Oh dear ..."
2,more of the same,"sometimes when i listen to the radio in the states nowadays i wonder to myself if bands really care anymore. i mean im not going to hate on these guys saying they are talentless wretches, but i mean, as much as they dont suck, they dont rule either. they are just that. plain old average. nothing spectacular. nothing new, or original, nothing that stands out. i mean i listen to the radio and i have no clue whos on any more because they all sound alike. staind, creed, nickleback, hinder...it seems like all these bands are the same band, with ever so slight variations to them. they know that this sound sells records, so why take risks to strive for originality, strive for excellence? stay save and go with whats proven. maybe these guys are happy with mediocrity. more power to them, hey if you enjoy staying in the shallow end of the rock echelon, then so be it. its not for me though, so ill swim out to the depths, and support the true bands of rock-which is all about living dangerously."
2,Dissapointed,Compared to thier other C.D's this one is barely worth listening to. The lyrics you could find being sung by any other band and it appears as if Nickelback has lost all of thier originality. A song about an old girlfriend is good once and awhile but Nickelback kind of over did it on this C.D. Perhaps thier next C.D will be better.
2,5 Chords + Radio Contracts + Big Label Promotion = Big $$$$$,"That must be what the record companies were thinking. Yes people, Nickelback's back! With the same 5 chords and song structure, Nickelback have put out another album too many.I liked Photograph for the emotion. That's about it. The rest of the songs are the same whether you look at them from teh 4/4 or teh same 5 chords.Peace.P.S. Nickelback fans, realise radio and MTV are the advertising jingles for their money making, catchy, pointless rock groups."
1,terrible,"I purchased this music and did not know that I had to have the ""Cloud"" to actually receive it. I had no choice and tried to cancel my order because I refuse to buy the ""Cloud"" and still got charged for the music and I still have no access to it.I WILL NOT buy any more music from here!"
1,Named themselves after Starbucks..??!!,"You have to be KIDDING ME!! They named their band after the nickel YOU get back from buying a cup of swill from Starbucks. I can't stand these clowns. The only reason they make music has got to be that they knew they could release this crap and get a truckload of tail. It physically pains me to know that this unholy garbage has received 5 star reviews. 1 star is WAY to many stars. If the lead ""singer"" was standing here right now, I'd kick his ass. If you ever want to know what good music is, see my other reviews. Nickelback..? God help us."
1,Generic as it gets!,"This is as generic and bland as rock music can get. This CD is immensely boring. This album basically embodies all the stereotypical radio rock elements you can image.If you want the monotonous truck-commercial sounding riffs and awful wannabe-Pearl Jam sounding vocals, you have it all in this album.There's honestly A LOT a band can do with 2 guitars, bass and drums. What drives a band to produce a CD of music which seriously sounds like it was made specifically for the radio? Probably money. Don't buy this album if you're a music fan. Leave this one for the casual radio listeners."
5,Finally...,"FM radio introduced me to Nickelback, thus my reluctance to purchase any of their discs. After their 3rd or so hit, I succumbed and bought Curb and The Long Road. I was still unimpressed. It seems like Chad Kroeger has stumbled onto a ""formula"" for hook-ey three and a half minute songs that will be hits.But this album changed my mind. Yeah, I know-the ""hooks"" are still there, but so is the musicality. This is probably their heaviest album, and that's why I'm enjoying it.Vinnie donating a Dimebag solo didn't hurt either (Side of a Bullet had me googling and discovering Pantera and Nickelback were solid friends).So....If you're the 2 star reviewers complaining about redundant formulaic rock...yeah-it's still there BUT it's a bit heavier and more musical.I gave it 5 stars because I can't get 3 of the songs out of my head. That's an achievement in itself with my listening habits."
5,a band that just gets better,"i bought this album with the usual high hopes i have when buying nickleback albums and once again i have not been dissapointed! good guitar riffs amazing bass lines lyrics that just get more catchier as they progress and songs that just get better and better!!! stand out songs for me are: far away amazing for anyone who has been in a long disstance relationship, photograph, animal and do it again. if you have not got this yet get it now!!!!!1"
5,My one and only CD,"I don't buy CD's any more and right now, this is my only CD. I love Nickelback and I have been a fan since they first came out. I wanted this CD because of the song ""Far Away"". I love this song because it came at a time when I was apart from my kids and husband. If you love Nickelback, buy this CD."
5,Truly a kicking album through & through!!!,"If you like Nickelback you'll love this CD. If you buy it for the hits or ""All the Right Reasons"", guess again. There are currently songs on this CD that I believe will be big hits in the near future to come such as ""Rock Star"". Great songwriting through and through. Five star CD without doubt!!!"
1,Another Consistent Effort,"Of all the post-grunge rock bands, Nickelback is the one I seem to always come back to. I couldn't stand Creed and Nickelback at least seems to be able to take over the throne that Creed once sat on. On one hand, if you're a Nickelback fan, you'll love this album. Kroeger is very talented at writing consistently catchy rock songs. Some folks either love or hate his voice, but it's something I can get into pretty easily. Lyrically, these guys aren't breaking any new ground. Every album they've released has some juvenile wordplay and you wonder if Kroeger actually ever slaps his inner child back into maturity. That flaw aside, if you're a fan of their last major releases (Silver Side Up and The Long Road) you'll probably be as happy with this as I have been. Catchy and upbeat? Definitely. Though-provoking and ground-breaking? Try System of a Down. (By the way, I meant to give this 4 stars, it just didn't save that way.)"
4,Love Nickleback,There are som super geat tracks on this album. The only reason I give it a 4 instead of a 5 is because there are a few songs with erotic language that I wasn't expecting and I think Nickelback is too great of a band to have to sing about explicit content. Leave that to the one minute pop sensations.
1,This album makes me sick,"Basically everything I said in my Hinder review applies here since the music on here sounds exactly the same. This is terrible monotonous slop posing as ""rock"" music. If you wanna listen to grunge listen to the real deal and avoid this boring overplayed radio rock."
3,Dimebag Is Still Alive In Our Hearts,"I didn't buy this CD and don't intend to. ""Photograph"" is an OK song but it is hightly overrated. The reason to buy this, if any, is to hear ""Side of a Bullet"" or something like that cuz Dimebag was a beast. Hands down. I respect Chad Kroeger for admitting he was influenced by one of the greatest bands ever: Pantera."
1,Sad,These guys are pathetic. Another no talent band selling records to the lost souls that listen to radio pop.
4,Nickelback,this cd is great....these guys are great in concert. have seen them twice. very impressive and awesome music.
1,Defective CD?,"Nickelback was a band I had heard of, but I'm not very into the modern music scene. My friend suggested this CD to me.I ordered this CD with high hopes. When I got it and put it into my laptop, everything seemed normal. There was every song, different names, different lengths.I listened to the first song, and all was well. I then moved on to the second song.It was the exact same song? I knew I couldn't be mistaken. Surely every song would have its own unique attributes to differentiate from the others. I went on to the next song, and then the next...but every single one was the exact same.I called my friend who had suggested the CD, but she said her CD was fine and that maybe something was wrong with mine. We got to talking about music videos and she told me her two favorites, I went and looked them up online.IT WAS THE SAME SONG FOR BOTH VIDEOS.I'm completely confused. Why are all the songs exactly the same?"
4,Got this for my hubby....,"I bought this cd for the hubby. He thoroughly loves it. I only found it ok. The songs that have been released as singles are great, the rest of the songs on the cd aren't fantastic, and a little to heavy for me personally. But all in all not a bad cd."
4,Mainstream rock at it's best.,"Nickelback are modern rock royalty by now. By no means are they one of my favorite bands, as I think they get overplayed. But they don't make bad music. All of their albums are pretty solid and they definitely write some catchy hooks.For some reason I always feel embarrassed of the fact that I own their records though. I don't know if it is because most of the stuff I listen to is really heavy or what.Oh well. It's another solid record, anyway."
1,Worst band in mainstream history.,These guys are the biggest joke of all time. Just throwin' it out there. Don't waste your money on this garbage.
1,Are they really serious???,"In all honesty, these guys are the worst f**king band I've ever heard. Completely unoriginal, cookie-cutter pop (NOT rock) that years ago would have qualified as ""corporate rock,"" the concept of bands starting to write radio-friendly songs to make money off of, instead of staying true to the music."
4,Excellent Album,"I bought this CD because I liked four songs on it and the snippets of the other songs sounded good, plus the price was low. After listening to it many times, I still like to listen to all but one of the songs, and even that one is OK. This CD has a good balance of hard rock songs and smoother, slower, rock ballads. The booklet has the lyrics to all the songs on the CD, which is nice. If you like Nickelback's recent songs, you will probably like this CD."
3,The Right Truth Of This Album,"Nickelback's 2005 effort All the Right Reasons is a decent album at best, but you've heard it all before. It's not a bad CD, except you people seem to be going too far on criticizing this band. They aren't that bad; they're just decent. I agree that some of the lyrics on this album are bad, but not crucially bad. Just enjoy this for what it is.Rating: 3 stars/5 stars"
3,Nickelback,"Oh Lord, I bought this for my sons. They LOVE Nickelback. I saw them in concert and at the time they rocked. This is a good CD, but EXTREMELY overplayed. Buy it if you want to party like a ROCKSTAR!"
4,Solid listening for the road,"While some might say that this group is a slightly formulaic, you can't deny they do it well. The lyrics, instrumentals and vocal work show a band that has earned it's place. I have several of their earlier albums, each showing improvement. The music is a mix of rock with a touch of grunge for spice. Looking forward to seeing these guys on stage someday."
5,Nickle Back has done it again!,"Nickleback have done it again. This CD rocks and is awesome. Nickleback have made all there songs on this CD great. Some of my favorite songs are "" Someone that you're with"" and the other song that I think is a really good song is ""Side of a bullet"". One thing that I think is great that Nickleback does is that they spend lots of time on their CD's and make sure all their songs sound good. I don't really like it when other bands make 1 or 2 good songs then rush through the rest to make a CD. Nickleback always is making their CD sound awesome. They have done another great rock CD again."
2,Surprised,"The songs from this album that I have heard on the radio made me want to buy this cd. However, when I listend to it all the way through, it seemed like all the other songs were very hardcore alternative which is something I am not a fan of. I would recommend listening to this cd on iTunes before deciding to buy it or not. The hits on the radio make it decieving."
5,You have all the right reason to listen to this cd on this cd,"All songs are really great.Lyrics range from sexy , teenage, romanticevery day to rock.Never boring .That's a promise!Would recommend it to everybody because there is something for everyone on this cd."
2,Not quite what I expected,"Since this had no measurements I assumed that ""half size"" was relative to the full size commercial sheet pans. The actual measurement of this rack is only 10"" x 8"", my mistake, but it is very hard to tell from the photo that it is so small."
1,Disappointing Meditaton Audio,"I have listened to many of Bernie's meditation recordings. I found this one to be repetitive and boring, actually. I was quite disappointed that it did not seem to live up to his previous work."
2,He is a lovely man...,"Bernie Siegel is a lovely man, a good doctor, knowledgeable about mind/body interactions. But get your meditations from someone who does meditation."
2,MISSING TOTAL # of CD's,"Nowhere in the product description do I find a TOTAL NUMBER of CD's included in this ""Audio Book"".A BOOK normally contains more than one LEAF."
4,pretty good,"I enjoyed this book, but don't think it is for everyone. Black Mirror is about a girl named Frances who was a resiprient of a scolarship program. But after her brother Daniel commits suicide, she just can't get over it. She feels that it's some how her fault. But all isin't quite what it seemes: something deeper is going on here.All in all this was a pretty good book. I've read better, but also much much worse. It's a some what dark book about a depressed young women trying to find her way. Black Mirror has a well thought of plot, though it can be somewhat confusing at times. This may be a good book to try just for the sake of trying it. Hope you like it!"
4,Taking it up a level,"Nancy Werlin's Black Mirror establishes her place as an interpreter for angsty teenagers everywhere. The interesting, tightly woven plot serves as a background for an exploration of depression, self-involvement and discovery that allows us a look inside that often forgotten misery known as high school. She creates well-realized characters that, while not always likeable, are often loveable. Can't wait to read the next one!"
4,Book Gets Better,"This is a great book. In the beginning I got a little bored, but when the plot started to speed up I got more and more intrested. I would say that you should definitley read this book. If you like books that are mysteries that take turns and curves then you will like this book. Nancy Werlin is a great author and writes good books. I will read more of her works in the future."
5,BLACK MIRROR,"Frances doesn't want to look in the mirror.She has hidden from the world and herself for years.She had a brother name Daniel who committed suicide and he left behind a note for his girlfriend and no one else.Frances thinks Daniel has been murdered. Daniel appears in her mirror and speaks to her...""Black Mirror""is really good book to read. It was so good that I just want to read all of it in one day.If I had to read a book 3 times, I would read this one."
5,Nancy Werlin is in a class by herself!,"Ms. Werlin has a sure hand with psychological suspense and for creating and relating to teenaged characters. Frances Leventhal is another unique creation in YA literature, and Ms. Werlin pulls no punches in telling Frances's story. If you want to be on the edge of your seat but still care deeply about the people you are reading about, you can't go wrong with anything by Nancy Werlin."
5,black mirror,It was the best book I ever read. I thought that is was dramatic but yet calm at times.
3,...not what I expected,"yes, I'll admit I liked this book. It was well developed, mysterious, and had two twists - one that was unexpected and the other that you could probably figure out. But, there was ONE thing that I didn't enjoy...the cursing and foul language. I feel that some of it was completely unessecary. Overall, it was a good book thou."
1,Dont buy this they just flat out lied.,This has more bubles than any other product and I want my money back!
5,This book rates more than 5 stars!,"I am a reading specialist, and our school is just beginning a new intervention program for phonics. This book is indispensable for teaching phonological awareness. It has loads of activities for all the ""rungs on the ladder"" of the phonemic awareness continuum. These include activities for:Words in a Sentence, Syllables, Rhyming, counting phonemes, etc. Blackline masters for pictures, etc., used in the activities are included. It also includes activities for teaching phonics (phonological awareness does not include printed letters, but phonics does include print.)I highly recommend this book for teaching beginning reading skills."
5,THE BEST for P.A.,"I have been a teacher for 10 years and this is the best book for assessing and then providing FUN instruction for phonemic awareness. The activities come on cards with directions, PERFECT for parent volunteers in the classroom or to send home as home activities. This book keeps the learning fun. I actually already own this book but I can't find it so I am ordering another!! That's how much I LOVE IT!"
5,Full of great ideas,This book is full of great ideas for literacy centers in the primary classroom. There are great pictures and games that several students can do on their own. This is a must have resource for those that teach early reading.
4,great,"Another great book also written by the same person who wrote Getting Ready to Read. This book was filled with easy fun activities that don't take long to put together. Great book for busy teachers who want good ,practical and fun activities.."
3,Not as good as the first...,"I was so disappointed with the monkies talking in this book! I don't know what but this one little detail made is so much less realistic. The same themes are present in this book as in the last and it did make me smile, and left me thinking (until i fell asleep) but quite honestly this book did not live up to the first. I bought this at a used book store for quite cheap and I am happy I read the sequel to MvR, but overall it was a little disappointing."
5,Mythology in California,"Volcanos, native American myths, Australian myths, intrigue, murder and mayhem...all these and more will be found in this second book of the Glass House trilogy. I couldn't put it down."
1,No no no no! How could they go so badly wrong?,"Boy oh boy. Walden Farms is really a hit and miss operation.I think this stuff is probably my least favorite of their products I've tasted so far. What makes no sense is that the ingredients that might add alfredo-esque taste, if they would choose to employ them in the recipe, aren't caloric. Spices and salt would go a long way toward making this stuff edible.I will add that though the sauce is also as thin as h-e-double-hockey-sticks, I can deal with that in a zero-cal food. That's a sacrifice I can live with. But it's the sickly-sweet flavor and the lack of any sort of savory component that makes this stuff such a startlingly-awful flop. I suspect there's a whole lotta Splenda goin' on in this stuff. Give it a pass and just thin out some other bottled ""lite"" alfredo sauce using fat-free milk."
3,Not too bad,"I found that it was pretty tasty expecially on whole wheat pasta. Yes, it is thin, but a little goes a long way. Both my husband and I thought for a diet product this was okay."
2,A different view of the grill,"Not particularly amusing. Does, however, provide some different cooking results from the normal. I'm not certain I would get another one if mine disappeared."
3,"""Disappointed""","Book has VERY few recipes - just a handful or less in ea. category. Might be ok for someone just learning to ""grill"" as they are very easy & require only a few ingredients. But title is really misleading as book is not really funny - or fun-just a few basic recipes."
1,UTTER DISAPPOINTMENT,"After reviewing the book, u can definitely notice the editorial staff must have put a huge amount of afford in this book, trying to project something proper from all those utter mediocre material from mr. testino. Instead of the signature nicely crafted testino shoots that he's known for, we got tons of over-blown blurred cityscape snap shots that wouldn't even fit the wall of a DKNY shop! If this is another publication that is supposed to show ""the other side"" of the testino spectrum, like his previous books. Then it only shows that even a god can be mortal if he doesn't try.completely overpriced with a un-necessarily large format to round up the disappointment."
2,Not the best of Testino,"This a one of the books that I find disappointing. I prefer his work on other publications and if you're a lover Mario's work, buy Visionaire or the V magazine instead."
1,Old fashioned musings,"I got this because I love Designing Women, but I was disappointed.This book is poorly written. A lot of the sentences are tortured and long winded, with lots of extra adjectives and adverbs, etc.The other problem I had is that there was very little about designing women and its making. Major parts are about her childhood, etc. which was of no interest to me. Much of the book are her opinions on things that are of little importance, and her ideas on everything are very old fashioned. My guess is that the only women who will like this book are in the 65 plus range.The one part of the book I liked was that she copped to having 2 facial cosmetic surgeries to be on Designing Women.You would do better to just talk to any older woman over 60 and ask what her childhood was like, and save your money on this book.If you are interested in Designing Women stuff, the Delta Burke book has more info on that."
4,"I liked it, but....","Every Peter King book is a delight. However since I'm somewhat familiar with the geography of Austria, Germany and Hungary, I resented the liberties the author has taken in describing the route of the 'Danube Express'. (Time and time again, locales were transposed and places attributed to the wrong countries)The description of the meals is, as always in a Peter King book, superb and the plot and atmosphere are interesting."
4,"Love the brand, watch is great - but not perfect","I am a big fan of the Locman brand and this watch was a great price. I use it as my day to day watch primarily. The face is great (big, but not too bulky) and relatively simple. The only complaint I have is that the band is a bit small."
3,Lackluster follow up to a wonderful novel.,"What more could you ask for in setting and plot? Staging a mystery among the ranks of Alexander the Great's troops, during the early years of his reign. It should be a sure fire success, especially for such an esteemed writer of historical fiction. But the drab Israelite Miriam, who is the sleuth in these tales, serves as a voice of criticism of a culture that the writer clearly doesn't understand.I mean this in the fact that the 'history' is excellent, the plotting is well done, but the constant remarks deriding Greek culture and religion is simply ignorant. A shame.Add to this the distraction that the reader is constantly assaulted with mispellings and errors in grammar every few pages, showing that some editor should have lost their job over this one. :)"
3,Yet another Paul Doherty pseudonym!,"Yes, Paul Doherty, UK's busiest history/mystery writer, pops up in a US edition only for his newest (and last) pseudonym. Apparently from now on all his books will be published under the DOHERTY byline but I'll believe that when I see it. Perhaps this particular period is not his strongest-readers of his first Apostolou pointed out some mistakes-but followers of this highly successful writer will not need much encouragement to have a go at this title."
2,not good,"I would have liked to give this book a 2.5, but that option is not available & it's not good enough for a 3. That said, I am an enormous fan of Paul Doherty, but not of this particular series. His more recent series with Alexander is far, far better. There are just too many historical inaccuracies and too much license taken with actual historical facts. Miriam (the detective) is a dreary, drab, unbelievable little squab of a character (Jews at the court of Philip? Female at that? I doubt it!!).However, Paul Doherty is a wonderful writer and I would give everything else I have read by him a 4.5 or 5."
1,dishonest marketing,"As has already been pointed out, all the 5-star reviews below are shills. One is even (apparently) posted by one of the d'Andrea brothers who founded the Hooah company; the language of his review is mostly lifted from their marketing copy.As to the supposed facts, calling maltodextrin a ""complex carb"" that gives ""long-lasting energy"" is totally disingenuous. Maltodextrin has a glycemic index of 137, meaning it raises blood sugar even more rapidly than the high-fructose corn syrup in typical carbonated soft drinks. If you want complex carbs, eat whole grains."
5,"Once Again, Way To Go HOOAH","I must say, this is the best energy drink that I have ever tried. My 8 year-old son races Motocross and drinks energy drinks on busy race days. He often has me take a sip of whichever one he is drinking. He loves to see my face crinkle up and laughs when I say, ""How can you drink that stuff?"" There was no funny face when I tried this one. This drink tastes like lemon water. It doesn't have that ""thick syrup-y"" texture that many others have and there is no bitter after taste. After tasting it, I read the label. No Caffeine, 45% of the daily value of vitamin C--Hooah. You can bet that these will be in my fridge next to the milk and OJ. I have finally found an Energy Drink that I can confidently pack in the motocross and cheerleading gear bags. My 5 year-old even likes it and feels like ""a big girl"" because she is permitted to drink ""Motocross Soda"". I am sure I will be breaking up many fights over who gets the last Hooah! Thanks Hooah!!"
1,Sugar Water,"This stuff is just sugar water. If you look at the ingredients, all it has is a few different kinds of sugar and vitamin C. What good is an energy drink with no caffeine? It would be cheaper to just drink some orange juice."
1,"Not an energy drink, just a marketing [...]",There are no energy drink ingredients in this stuff. It's sugar water with a miniscule amount of vitamin C.A completely pathetic rip-off marketing hype which sadly is being sold as a troop supporting product.Supporting the troops should not involve buying garbage sugar water at high prices. If you want an energy drink try Rockstar or Monster. If you want to support the troops buy a savings bond.
2,good for one time,"These were fine for one time, but they got a hole in the toe after wearing them for about 3 hours. I liked the top though. It was nice not to have to deal with a garter belt."
1,Garbage,"These panty hose were a bunch of garbage. They came with a run already in the very thin nylon. The only good thing about them, I was able to return them for free and get my money back. I would recommend purchasing the MUSIC LEGS 338 Spandex sheer suspender pantyhose instead."
2,Didnt work,These were basically useless and were nearly impossible to mount in any sort of balanced way. I didnt like them the end.
2,"[Two and a half stars out of four] Not bad - violent yes, but Carradine turns good performance & look for his daughter, Calista!","Carradine stars as ex-Agent now livinggood life, operating restaurant, playingthe piano and drinking expensive wine un-til an unexpected visitor (muscleheadFrank Zagerino, this generations 'WingsHauser', B Movie star) shows up and anno-uces that the dreaded 'Elias' (LorenzoLamas, m.i.a sice the disasterious 'Snake-eater', w/ Larry Csonka, unbilled) shows upand stars killing people and kidnapping folk-es Dave and Frank like. He thens gets his com-euppance! Pretty gory at times but great senseof humour keeps things moving. Calista Carra-dine, a dark haired temptress is looking goodin here as well. You did good work there Dave!"
3,only okay,"This book is not what I really expected. It's in a drawing/cartoon form. I was going to give it to my father-in-law for Christmas, but instead, will be giving it to my step-son. It does have neat inventions."
4,The last great album by Chicago,Every song on here is very good. The arrangements are well thought out. After this corporate America ate Chicago and the rest is reflected in their music. Their best song writer Robert Lamm started his frustration tail-spin after this and burned out by Chicago 8.
2,What a sad decline!,"I bought Chicago V because I was so overwhelmed by Chicago's ""Live at Carnegie Hall"" which I have rated 5 stars, and because I read some good reviews on Amazon.com about it. But what a disappointment was Chicago V! Whilst technically no major slips (hence the second *), it is very dull, no umpf, no excitement, nothing to compare it with the ""Live at Carnegie Hall"" triple CD! As I understand from some reviews, their later albums are even worse... (if that's possible). I'm not listening to Chicago V anymore. I also bought Chicago I (Transit Authority) which contains a lot of the songs of the Live album. This one is OK, say 4 stars, but is still clearly inferior to the Live Album."
1,re-recorded...by who? - get the original cut,"This is one of my favs from back in the day. but this is either an atrocious edit or a bad cover. either way, do yourself a favor and get a different version."
5,Rob Base & D.J. E-Z Rock C.D. Album,"This updated c.d. album is not the original album that released in the late 80's early 90's but the songs & tracks on the updated album are the exact same tracks on the original. You would pay around $50.00 for the original before shippping costs. The updated album is just like going to a music store & buying a new album released in todays 2009 world of music for usually under $20.00 after taxes in the majority of the 50 states in the United States of America. You can't go wrong with this updated version. Only difference with this album you would have to purchase online or ""special order"" the updated version through your favorite music store if they didn't have in stock. (In most cases) So if you're old skool like me get this c.d. than listening to the complicated or different styles of music today that most ""teens"" listen to that (I) rather not listen to."
3,This Kansas record deserved a better fate,"Other reviewers have already told it like it is: Thisis not classic Kansas as rock radio would have you remember, but there is some meaty stuff here, and it's a shame theband isn't doing more of this material. Steve Morse waslost here. ( I've asked him; he admits it. ) Not wasted,just lost. There's some sweet fret work, but his stylenever meshed with Rich Williams, and besides, this isn'ta two guitar boogie band; this band needs keyboards and..well not Steve Morse. Morse is doing extraordinary workwith Deep Purple because he is a featured player, not someonewho can work into the rotation with another player.Anyway, spend the 7 bucks. Get this CD,if you like Kansas. Steve Walsh is in terrific form, the material is solid and occasionally superb, and they really sound like they meanit."
4,"Good album, but not the best one","Although I live in not English speaking country, I am an old fan of this band. So, I have recently bought this album, but I agree with the other cumstomers' reviews who pointed the lack of violin here. Despite of it, I consider this album good enough. To compare, one can see my reviews about ""Leftoverture"" and ""Drastic Measures"" albums of this band."
5,great grip - good quality,"28.5"" girls basketball. tried to find a good, quality ball at decent price. this fits tehe bill. good job. a"
2,Poor quality.,"Kinda disappointed of the quality. Right from the get-go you'll notice that the materials used was fairly cheap. I've had great spalding basketballs prior to this one. This just doesn't compare I guess they don't make quality spalding basketballs anymore except for the highly priced ones. I'm sorry to say this but, ""made in china"" says it all. Pretty much wasted money on this one. You're better off buying wilson basketballs, though they're also ""made in china"", they use far more better materials. I play competitive basketball, indoors, once a week and I shoot around and play pick up about 3 times/week outdoors. If you really wanna go for this basketball I recommend just using it indoors and always make sure to keep it clean. Or you could just go and grab the wilson jet."
3,one flat ball (out of 5),I ordered 5 for my youth basketball team. 4 of the 5 are great...one won't hold air. Overall I'm disappointed in the purchase. Feel like I should have purchased at a local sporting goods store.
3,Good to great for a casual player,"I got this for my son who is still little. The ball has a good enough grip for a smaller guy. I've only used the ball indoors so I can't comment on other reviewers who have said that the ball lost it's grip. For all of our indoor play, the ball has been fine. But I can see that playing outdoors, the ball would get more gritty and eventually lose it's tackiness.Then again, it stays inflated, is a nice ball and goes through the hoop. No complaints from me. If you play a lot, I would give some of the other reviews some more credibility though. Sounds like the soft tack fades."
3,Decent Bball especially for Indoors,"Nice looking basketball and does have that tacky feel for better grip. It is ready to go straight from the box. Although it can be played indoors or out, it seemed to do better indoors for us. We worry about the tackiness getting dirty outside and losing its grip but my grandson likes it well enough and he and his dad have great fun with it. He tries to play with me but I am not very good. For the price, a good investment."
2,"stays inflated, thats about it","Had the ball for a couple of weeks now, only pro I can about the ball is that it stays inflated pretty well, but you would expect that from a new basketball.Out of the package, the ball felt great, but after a few mins playing at an outdoor court, the ball lost all its grip which is very dissapointing. Feels like a ball that is worn down already. I've owned bballs that haven't got worn down like this after 6 months of use. I play around twice a week so I'm not putting that much ""strain"" on the ball. Totally not worth the cost of the ball, extremely dissapointed!!!"
3,Meh...,"it's ok... Nothing special. Your typical cheap basketball. If you play outdoors, I could see this ball working alright. But for indoors...the grip is bad/slick. It doesn't wear into better grip from what I can tell. This ball also bounces off the rim like none other. If you play on a court with a ""new"" spring rim then you will have a heck of a time shooting unless it's absolutely pure. Luckily, I mostly play at an older gym... like from the 70s. It works perfectly fine there. For the price, it's ok. But I wish I would've spent the extra 20 and bought a real ball."
3,Probably better for indoor.,I've had this ball for a few days and so far I'm a little disappointed. When I tried it in Modells the grip felt great but after a few times playing on an outdoor court the ball does not have much grip. I wouldn't say that it lost the grip but I've noticed that it attracts so much dirt and dust and it all comes off on your hand. So the ball becomes slippery and so do your hands. I would choose a different one unless it would only be used on an indoor court.
1,Disappointment,"This ball felt great out the of packaging. I used it for a total of ten hours within 3 weekends. The ball has virtually no grip on it. Its smooth as a baby skin and feels like there is a coat of oil on the ball.I would not recommend anyone to buy this ball.If I had used this ball outdoors I can somewhat understand. But for only 10 hours of indoor use, this is ridiculous. Go buy a Nike ball instead.Very unhappy."
3,A Good Buy For The Price - Use Indoors Only Though,"If you are looking for a decent ball to use indoors this is a good, affordable choice. It feels great out of the package the ""tack"" on the ball responds well for shooters. I found that the ball rotation was better with this than a well worn basketball. Here are the grades:Weight: C- , could definitely have been heavierInflate Quality - B+ , Holds air wellFeel - B+, more tacky than other basketballs, but feels greatBounce - B, GoodOverall - B+Durability - C- , I would not use this ball outdoors. It does not have the right feel and I think it would fall apart after a few uses. Stick with indoor ball and its a good choice.Good quality ball for the indoors, recommended."
5,Great!,Great for playing in either indoor or outdoor conditions. I've already improved my outside shot practicing with this ball. It has a very good grip and is fun to shoot baskets with.
4,Great Grip,Got this ball for my 7 and 9 year old sons who have loved this ball. It is great out of the box and is a great weight. They boys have been playing with this ball outside all over the neighborhood for weeks now and the grip is still great and the ball is still inflated.Worth it.
4,nice puzzle,Got this puzzle to do with my girl freind. she loved it. It does take a long time to do. it is really nice puzzle going to hang it up.
1,Where are all the edge pieces,So i was so excited to receive this with no wait at all... I got it open and started to separate all the edge pieces from the other pieces in the box that were not edge pieces.. I have gont through the box 10000 times and still have barley any edge pieces.Also some of the pieces are very oddly shaped and small others are smaller than others and the pieces are definitley not the same size at all... what now? i have this puzzle that has missing edges and pieces that are so abstract it seems impossible... Destined to finish it i will attempt to finish it but the way its going .. no go..:(
5,Good Soundtrack,This Is a good soundtrack with Some Feeling to it. Almost all the songs on it are very good...And this Soundtrack is worth buying. If you like tenchi. you should get this
5,An awesome cd for an awesome movie!,The movie tenchi muyo: tenchi muyo in love was a very good anime movie and had very memorable music and characters. If you have seen the movie then you know that you can't be without this cd.
4,"A very, very good instrumental CD with one flaw","I saw this movie a few weeks ago on the sci-fi channel. Well, actually I set the VCR to record it at 3 am, which was when it was on. Not a bad movie, but not legendary either. The thing that caught my eye was when I noticed Chris Franke, whom I am a big fan of for his Babylon 5 stuff, had done the music. Wow. I didn't even recognize him until I watched the movie again (That glittering sound- B5 fans know it- always gives him away). So I decided to buy the soundtrack, and really, they underuse Chris in the movie itself. ""Tenchi's Decision"" is one of the best tracks, but in the movie you barely hear it... ah, well. The one flaw in the CD is the vocal track, ""Alchemy of Love."" Ugh. Chris, the music is nice, but the lyrics and singing are bad, bad, bad. Don't do vocal anymore, okay? Chanting and choir is fine, but No Vocal. Got it?"
1,Not worth $170 (new) for this book.,"I bought this book for my boyfriend's Christmas gift last November for $170.70 (new) from Any Book Via Amazon.My boyfriend is a serious Gretsch guitar collector, so I thought this book will impress him.But when I received this book, I was so disappointed.It was so small & thin with terrible photographs.It doesn't worth $170.70.What a rip off!Don't buy this book.There are many other fantastic books on Gretsch guitars out there that are much less expensive and have great contents & photographs.I returned this book immediately."
5,Great read for Gretsch enthusiasts,"I bought my first Gretsch guitar about a year ago and fell in love with it. I was so enamored by the look and feel of it, I became a bit obsessed with Gretsches and soon after purchased a Gretsch White Falcon. The sections about Jimmy Webster and the inventive ideas he came up with were so fascinating I read the book 2 times in a few days. It was like reading about Q from James Bond, if Q was into guitar making! The back of the book contains a useful chart for gauging the age and origin of a lot of Gretsch models. The pictures were fantastic. I'll hang onto this book forever just based on the photos alone!"
4,"out of all the Soulfly albums, this one is the best.","its pretty much common knowledge that Max's best work by far is the music he made with Sepultura. no Soulfly album will ever live up to that. this is an undeniable fact. however, I honestly believe that the new Soulfly album ""Dark Ages"" is definitely the best post-Sepultura work Max has ever done. the song Frontlines by itself is Max's greatest track since the Roots album. I would say that most of the Soulfly albums are good. not great, but good. this one however sounds like Max has a renewed vengence and power that has injected some brutality into a band that is beginning to hit a plateau. with next year's 10th anniversary of Dana's death coming up in August, I remain hopeful that maybe it will spark a potential Sepultura reunion with Max. we can only hope."
4,Arise Max! Arise!!!,"Buddy of mine played this for me in his car the other day-I couldn't believe it. I found ""Prophecy"" to be very interesting, but I ws in no rush to buy it...however a year later Max is back with this brutal, and oh so very metal effort. Like everyone here is sayin', this truly is a return to true thrash metal form, back to the ROOTS. Sorry, had to do it. Check it out-if you gave up on Max years ago like I did, this should put a smile on your face and faith back in your soul-all our metal heroes don't have to die, but when they do, some actually come back. Fav moments are the trippy breakdown of ""I and I"" and the beautiful last track ""Soulfly V"". All the rest is pure riffin, baby, tearin it up old school. Sweet."
5,This is metal done right with a twist.,"This is not your standard Soulfly. This is metal but does have the standard Max twist. I would disagree with a previous review that says Max got flack for leaving Sepultura to create a ""nu-metal"" band. That was the direct Sepultura had taken and was not a big suprise when Soulfly made the music it did.This album is a change of pace. I prefer The Prophecy and prefer Soulfly's ""standard"" music, but this album makes me think there is hope for metal these days. I personally feel there has been an extreme lack of good metal for the past 10 years.If you are a Soulfly fan you should like this album. If you are a metal fan you should like this album. If you are an old school Sepultura fan you should like this album. If you like the weak new school Sepultura you wll not like this album."
5,Hell yeah!!,"Welcome back, Max Cavalera. The metal world has missed you. Whatever it is that's made him revisit the brutal music he made with Sepultura, he should let it ride. Of course, it's not just all brutal... he's picked up a few tricks from his time in Soulfly, with the world influences. Oddly enough, as much as I loved Sepultura, I could never get into Soulfly (the first album featured Fred Durst, after all), but I can't stop listening to Dark Ages. It's hard to pick a favourite track... hell, each and every one of them will stomp a mudhole in your ass. But I gotta give it up for his rather cool tribal-infused take on Prodigy's 'Firestarter' (renamed 'Riotstarter'), and 'Arise Again', which is definitely a nod to his former band... Viva La Max!!"
4,Another album like Roots,"This is another good album . Its as good as Roots and Primitive. IT has metal songs and relaxing songs thet are all very good. If you give it some listenings and <<you get its meaning>> you will definitely like it. I cant say love it , but Im sure you will like it. I like their formula and this album is better then their previous album -> I ho[pe they continue like this or even better."
2,I would have to disagree...,"Everybody is saying this is so heavy and yadda yadda. Sure this is a great Metal album, but thats it. Its just metal and the band has lost the edge it had with there first three albums. There a lot of metal bands out there and this sounds just like all of them. Max lost what he started in the Sepultura album Roots. I sure wish it would come back but its not looking like it will."
4,"not so ""BLEAK""","I think it was on my third listen of this cd when I discovered that it was AWESOME! First time I thought it didn't live up to the reviews. Second time I was like ""eh, not too bad."" Third time BAM Hell yeah! Max picks up where Roots left off (before the tribal chanting and what not) I'm not gonna describe every song but I will say track 6 is kind of weak and the last 3 aren't as good as some of the others. With 15 songs you're bound to have a miss or two and for that reason this album gets a 4."
5,Max Found Himself Once Again,"Soulfly steers away from the defunct nu-metal bandwagon and proves that Max didn't sell out with ""Dark Ages"". This brings back the days of older Sepultura and, once again, no help from any musicians for the 3rd time. Marc Rizzo is a hell of an amazing guitarist and can shred really great. There's less tribal influence on this one, but if you're a fan of modern thrash/groove metal, pick this up. You will be blown away."
5,Sepulfly,"Awesome! Aside from Cavalera Conspiracy, this and Conquer are Max's best work since his Sepultura days! Any fan of the original Sepultura, Soulfly, or all things Max should thoroughly enjoy this release. Very heavy, no weak sh** here! This album, Conquer, and 3 are my favorite Soulfly albums, but even Soulfly at their worst is better than any Sepultura album with Derrick Green! Sepultura should have changed their name to Green Hell when Max left and Derrick stepped in, but that's another story."
3,Max's best effort post Sepultura,"I am sure that there are plenty of Sep fans that have lost their patience with the quality of Max's releases post Sepultura. Whilst this album is no classic B.T.R., Arise or Chaos A.D. the sound of this album definitely lends itself to the above mentioned albums. Max this time around has decided to follow his thrash roots with a much faster paced album. The incorporation of more solos will also bring a smile to many fans of Max's older stuff. Unfortunately Max again on this album displays his self indulgent side by including the terrible Innerspirit and Riotstarter (Nobody wants to hear this Rubbish Max - Leave it for a B-Sides compilation you can release when you are 60). These songs only take your attention away from what is a fairly solid metal cd. So if you have missed the old style seps then it might be time to jump on the bandwagon and purchase Dark Ages."
1,Most dreadful tarot deck I've ever used,"As the owner (and user) of over 40 tarot decks, I can honestly say that the Tapestry tarot is the one deck that I wish I'd never bought. I paid $5 for my copy, and that was $5 too much. The pictures are simply ugly..dim colors, and poor quality photographs. The tapestries bear little resemblance to anything related to tarot symbology. There are needlessly huge white borders around the photographs on each card, which makes the deck look even worse. The card stock quality is poor, and the cards are awkwardly sized...large and square, with square corners instead of rounded off corners as most decks have. It is nearly impossible to shuffle these cards. I tried to use this deck a few times but quickly grew to hate the sight of it."
1,Its an experience,"I am a tarot reader and enthusiast and have been for a long time. I have never found a deck that actually repulsed me. I opened the box and the feeling of revulsion to these was incredible. It's definitely not a deck I can use--and most of the people I have shown have had the same reaction. Some of the cards are downright creepy. The tapestry theme is a great idea and the cards do look like mini-tapestries done as a collage--colors are vivid and clear but its not a ""friendly"" deck to me. I can't even do a reading with them to try them out how they feel in that manner. I wish others better luck than me."
2,If I hear global capitalism one more time...,"I approached this book with some hope that it would yield help in understanding the great truths of ""Christ in you, the hope of glory"", the ""new self""; and many of the other profound distinctives of this letter. I was even open, as a stalwart conservative evangelical, to stretch my orthodoxy to make it more generous, but what I got was an effort to make every word of Colossians fit the neo-liberation theology agenda of its authors. Let the book say what it says, not what you had hoped it would say."
4,A Good Read,"I stumbled on I, Maya Plisetskaya by accident, through Amazon.com, and immediately snatched it up because I have always wanted to read an autobiography of this fascinating, enigmatic, and exceptionally talented ballerina of The Bolshoi Ballet.I, Maya Plisetskaya was a joy to read. The book goes into detail about how she was hounded by the KGB; her father murdered by Stalin's goons; her mother imprisoned; and how the [then] Politburo, under Leonid Brezhnev and Nikita Kruschev, forbade her to travel abroad with The Bolshoi Ballet, for fear she would defect.The book's pages are liberally sprinkled with poor grammar, repeated words, and meandering text. However, to me, reading this book was like sitting at a table with Ms. Plisetskaya, and over good food and drink, listening to her tell her life story from her heart and soul."
5,Interesting,Plisetskaya is my favorite dancer and that's why I wanted to know more about her. I have studied ballet and I'm familiar with the life of dancers. Thus her artistic devotion was something I have read and seen with my own eyes before. The most striking description in this book is that of being an artist in the Soviet Union under the communist rule. I felt clautrophobic through out my reading. Overall I highly recommend this book.
4,"interesting, revealing",I loved the book even though at points it was hard to follow. Sometimes it got a little too confusing with lot of russian names and positions. But it was great reading about her life and ballets.
3,A decent album,"Chicago X features some good music. I recommend it solely for the first half of the album--it's excellent. The second half is weaker, but still listenable. If you're new to Chicago's albums, get the first three albums before buying any of the later ones--you can't go wrong with them."
1,This book stank.,"This book succeeded in being weird while at the same time remaining completely pointless throughout. To make matters worse, it had pretensions of contributing to the serious and well established genre of the ghost story. Of course, how good could any novel be in which the main character is a part time Hollywood producer part-time adventurer named ""Richard Storm""? Or sentences such as: ""He clasped Sophia against him, felt the warmth of her body there, drank the warmth of her body in with his."" This book has ""pulp"" written all over it. None of this would be so bad if this book were more fun and not so gross and violent."
2,"Ultimately, Who Cares?","I finished ""The Uncanny"" last night. After a promising start the book became long, mysterious (not in a good way), muddled, and boring. Although there were flashes of good descriptive writing, I didn't feel that the story held together. The characters were vague and uninteresting people. And no final, acceptable explanation of the ""why"" behind the mystery emerged. Who was Iago? How/why did Storm's movie create him? How did he react when the triptych burned?? Who--or what--was ""the Uncanny?"" I was left feeling like I'd walked into a private conversation and was never included in what was going on, and ultimately I grew tired of reading and didn't care. Klavan needs to be a little less mysterious in future efforts to hold me as a reader."
2,A Pale Ghost,"Andrew Klavan is a talented writer who has given us two really exceptional books: ""True Crime"" and ""The Animal Hour."" In those books, Klavan created characters and situations that were complex, puzzling, interesting, and original. With ""The Uncanny,"" Klavan attempts to revamp the traditional ghost story by setting it in modern times and giving us ""hip"" characters like Richard Storm and Sophia Eberling. Somehow, for me, it just didn't work. The setting at the ""Bizarre"" magazine was novel, but not all that interesting. The ghost story itself was lame and poorly conceived. Although the book has flashes of brilliance, they are far too few, and overall, you're left with a rather unsatisfying ghost story. Read Peter Straub's ""Ghost Story"" for better chills!Michael Butts"
3,"Fun, but not as interesting as hoped...","Upon reading Andrew Klavan's True Crime, I figured that anything following would be of equal caliber. Unfortunately, the author missed the mark with this novel. The characters are interesting but just barely, the plot lacks a certain thrill and the ending left me with some unanswered questions, which may have been Mr. Klavan's intentions. I would not classify this novel as a horror/ghost story, maybe not even a thriller or mystery, as most reviewers have. Instead I think this book needs to be placed under the ""Possible TV Movie of the Week"" section."
4,The only Divinyls album that mattered.,"I used to listen to this album in the early eighties and loved it. All of this songs are meant to facilitate dark weekend nights alone, rolled up in a torturous ball on the floor, knowing all along that you are ridiculous. Oh, I guess that was just me. Anyway, the songs are catchy enough for most and dark enough for those who care. There isn't a bad song on here."
3,macabre true stories = depressing yet compulsive reading,"'A Rage To Kill' is the sixth installment of Ann Rule's ""Crime Files"", and I fear the series is running out of steam. While the others in the series focus on one main story followed on by shorter stories, this book only contains short-ish (30-50 pages) stories. And so we don't have the pleasure of Ann Rule's great research and insight, as found in her single story books (eg, 'Dead By Sunset'). It is as if the author didn't want to sweat the details and simply wanted to tart up police reports, and then stuff them into a book.Having said all this, Ann Rule does write in a very fluid style. Her books are always a fast read. And while the stories here are most definitely morbid and horrific, they are fascinating (much like viewing a road accident).Bottom line: empty calories for the brain. But like junk food, hopelessly addictive."
4,A Disappointing Read for Fans,"I've read quite a few of Ann Rule's crime files editions, plus other stories and this one was really disappointing. Having read the back cover, it sounded really compelling. It said that Ann ""uncovers the motives"" of Silas Cool. I didn't think she did that at all. As a matter of fact, I turned to the last page and was highly surprised. It seemed as if she couldn't be bothered to finish the story. I felt as if none of my questions had been answered regarding this case. It certainly wasn't deserving of the title case. It should have been one of the bonus stories, in my opinion.Having said that, the other cases in the book were classic Ann Rule. They were well written and interesting. I gave this book 4 stars because of the bonus cases. If you are going to read it, don't expect much from the first case. The rest are very good."
4,"Easy-read, interesting but troubling","This was my first Ann Rule book, having just gotten hooked on true crime a la Vincent Bugliosi (And the Sea Will Tell), Carlton Stowers (To the Last Breath), and Dennis McDougal (In the Best of Families). Rage to Kill is an easy read, well written, and each ""short"" story can be finished before falling asleep so it's like starting a new book when you pick it up again. This book would be particularly interesting to Washington state residents since all the cases happened there. Rage to Kill will make female readers afraid for themselves and their daughters so upon finishing this book they should quickly turn to other subject reading (like horse training or gardening) to get Ann's evil incarnates off their minds."
4,a little disappointing,"i am probably ann rule's biggest fan, and think she is by far the best true crime novelist around. however i was a little disappointed with this book, for 2 reasons. i live in seattle and the silas cool incident which happened less than a year ago is still fresh in my mind (he shot a bus driver, causing the bus to go off the aurora bridge). the entire city was perplexed as to why he did it, and i don't feel that ann really answers many questions about his motives. maybe it's because this book was on the bookstore shelves too soon after the incident. also, she profiles christopher wilder who abducted girls from shopping malls. he has been profiled before (i can't remember by whom) so this story isn't really fresh. the rest of the book is fascinating as usual, but you do get the impression that maybe she's trying to catch up to stephen king, pumping out one book after another."
3,Ms Rule Misses again!! Snoozer,"I used to buy a Rule book without even opening the cover. This book taught me, you can't judge a book by it's author. I love Ann, but all these cases were very shallow, boring and poorly written. I am terribly disappointed after years of enjoying her work, please Ms Rule, please slow down and give us more quality"
2,A disappointment for Ann Rule fans,"I became an avid reader of Ann Rule's true crime, but her case files seem to be thinning out. Worse yet, she seems to have been distracted while writing this paperback. The name of it suggests that the major story within is called ""A Rage to Kill"" but there is no such story in the book. She has some minor gaffs in the writing (pleading guilty by reason of insanity?) that make you wonder if she proofread it. The Bus to Nowhere could have been called The Story to Nowhere, because she didn't go any further into the killer's motives than pointing out that he was a sloppy housekeeper with no job (I fit one of those qualities). While her earlier works were derived from more sensational stories, these are little more than cleaning out the closet."
2,Chakra Clearing gone wrong . . .,"I agree with the writer from Arizona. This CD could be much better. The concepts are wonderful I would've just liked more clearer guided visualizations with pauses. Doreen Virtue seemed to breeze through the exercises and talk so much that I found it difficult to relax and visualize what she was saying. True, her need to properly enunciate every syllable in every word was distracting and her voice is not the soothest, unfortunately. A more relaxed approach would've been great instead of her reading off her script. I think I'm going to go with the other writer and possibly just make my own tape."
3,Yes and no,"Pleasant book, very easy read, with a few basic exercises for working with chakras. If you're looking for more in-depth information, try another book or search the web. Note: if you're not a Christian, you may want to seek another book, as the author relies heavily on a Judeo-Christian cosmology with God and angels; this makes it less accessible to some of us, even when we substitute our own beliefs in written or spoken word. (More difficult when you're working through the audio CD and the author mentions God.) This is said without disrespect to anyone; we're not all the same, and we're not all comfortable with Christianity. The author seems like a loving, centered person, and that's worthy of respect."
2,Poor Quality,"The content is fine. But the music, if you can call it that, is just terrible. It sounds like it's warped or something. Doreen's voice does not soothe or flow. She tries to enunciate every word properly, and that makes it sound artificial.I do like the content though, so I will write it out and make a new meditation tape for myself, using some really nice music, like Angel Love."
2,dissapointed,"I purchased this book ""used"" and it was supposed to have a ""meditation CD"" with it - it did NOT. Also, the book was very meditation oriented with not enough substance on the chakras themselves. Very dissapointed that I did not get the CD."
3,Good beginners guide,"This is a good beginners guide. My only bad comment would be is that I was looking to purchase the version with the audio cd too, but appears the cd only comes with the hard cover version - so was disappointed that I didn't get it."
3,Expected more,I think the meditations are too short or the CD should have more meditations for the price. The content is OK.
4,Quality of this product!,"I like this product very much! It's very beautifully put together. My only concerns is the quality of it. It has a very good content and information, yet I feel as if Doreen's voice was a little rough for the purpose of this tape. I feel as if the product in it's physical state was not very protective to the tape. Listing to the tape, I felt a little rediculus at moments because of the tone Doreen used. It did help me to full fill what I origionally intended, yet because the format could of been a little more professional, I rate this product a 4."
2,Ok For Very Basic Intro,"Having listened to this CD I was not impressed at all. Doreens voice is very monotone and the sound track just ok. I became uneasy listening to this meditation after one listen.May I strongly suggest Colette Baron Reids CD ""Journey Through The Chakras"".I have found no chakra CD even remotely as superb.Colettes voice is angelic and after many weeks of listening I still find her refreshing. The sound track is heavenly and deeply moving.Her website has many meditations free for listening.You will NOT be disappointed.I guarantee that you will be fulfilled.JG"
5,Listen to the clearing CD over and over again,"The author suggests playing the CD in the background, and even while you're away. I like the energy of the CD and the feel of my environment after I play it. The book is not all that profound, but the value is definitely in the CD."
2,I have a better suggestion,"Doreen writes wonderful books and creates beautiful card decks, but she should leave sound healing to those who really know what they are doing. Trust me, the sound quality and voice in this recording are NOT condusive to clearing your chakras!! For an excellent chakra meditation with soothing, clear voice, serenely healing crystal bowl tones and angelic healing vibrations, give yourself the gift of ""Crystal Voices"" cd, its the quintessence of chakra healing meditations (Amazon has it)."
3,Its okay,I have a hard time listening to her voice. Some other say the music is cheesy but I just cant get over her voice. I do listen to this CD and it does relax me at night if I tune out the monotone of her voice. Very strange. She needs to have someone else do the talking. I recommend Kelly Howell. She has a great voice for this.
4,"Easy, relaxing and harmless","This is a great gift for someone wanting to discover chakras and become aware of them in daily life, play with them and see what happens. The CD has a morning and an evening track, about 20 mns long, perfect for daily commute, easy to follow."
1,Very basic for beginners,Love Doreen but gave this as a gift to someone else.Look at Cyndi Dales book about chakras for great info.
4,chakra healing,"Everything was good, in good condition. Was disappointed that it did not come with the CD like the description said"
4,Chakra Clearing,Purchased this book from BooksforU and CD was not included. The problem was promptly addressed and I was issued a full refund. I want to thank this seller for their professionalism and prompt service. I will not hesitate to purchase from them again. Thank you KB.
2,Missing CD,"I ordered this book in the believe that even it was use it will come with the CD included but to my surprise the CD is missing and this was one of the reasons why i bought it. Unfortunately, I did not get what i was looking for. Next time when they display a product; they should put more information about the conditions of the item so people is aware . When, i bought it, I did not see any information saying that CD will be missing from the book or pages will be torn. If, I would have had this information before hand I would have got it new instead of used."
1,Extremely Unhelpful Material,"I once believed in the possibility that angels existed and would guide, help,and protect someone if that person asked them for help. I used this audiotape and based on my personal experience--and the extremely painful results--strongly recommend avoiding this tape."
1,Pure pseudoscience,"This belongs squarely in the science fiction column, as do most of the books at the top of the 'non fiction' list. Totally irresponsible to pawn this mental credulity as 'non fiction'.Pure baloney."
2,Chakra clearing CD,"I have ordered the book and CD but when I got it, the CD was glued/bound in to the binding of the book. To remove the CD it ruined the binding of the book and broke the CD. Although I have requested a replacement for the broken CD, I haven't heard anything yet."
4,Good Advice,"I friend suggested that I purchase this book and when I order it I didn't originally pay attention to the fact that it actually comes with a CD as well. That is a great added tool. We all get ""out of balance"" in life and this book helps teach you how to clear your Chakra so you can put yourself back on track. Good read and great CD, would certainly buy from this seller again."
4,It works. That's what matters.,"I have used this CD for its meditation journey less than a dozen times over the last 2+ years. Personally, I find it a bit cheesy and I don't like the music in the background. I can get over the cheesy music, because it's really about how grounded and clear I feel. And the effects for me really work. The guided meditations, going through my chakras, going within, quieting myself, listening and relaxing, clearing myself. It really does what it says ~ It has helped me in a few tight moments where I was a bit tweeked out and needed to ground and feel clear again. It's a special tool for special occasions, and I'm not surprised to see that it has received so many other positive feedbacks. It was recommended to me by a psychic that was 100% right on when she did a reading for me. Cheers!"
2,Lots of fluff little substance...,"I am an intermediate when it comes to developing my meditation practice. I am looking for something that gives me some spiritual context or theory around which I can build a deeper awareness of my practice. Although the authordoes a good job of explaining the basic idea of chakras in layman terms, to the more knowledgeable practitioner, it comes across as a lot of fluff that has no grounding in any context. The meditations are mix of self help common sense and don't really go much deeper than that.I really don't know how this got so many 5 star reviews. Either people have reallylow expectations or mine are way too high."
5,Very Great CD + Book!,"I read some of the issues that people had with this - I don't really agree. Doreen voice doesn't sound ""rough"" to me. I rather listen to her words and embrace what she is telling me to do. Whenever I listen to the night CD I fall asleep 1/2 way through it. I always used to wake up durning the night as well, and now, whenever I listen to this CD I don't! There is basically a morning and night version. Both are very fantastic and completely energize my spirit. I have got her angel cards as well which have really helped me with my spiritual experience with the Divine Creator!Just to keep in mind the book is short. It has a lot of great information, but isn't for deep, detailed information on the Chakras.Very highly recommended for the person who is tapping into the Chakra world with amazing energy!"
4,"Short, Simple and Effective!","Chakra Clearing: A Morning and Evening Meditation to Awaken Your Spiritual Power By Doreen Virtue:If you are looking for a CD that includes two meditations in one CD(one for morning, and one for evening) that are short and simple, that dont take a lot of time or effort, which has a morning meditation that just refreshes you and prepares you for your day, and then an evening meditation that relaxes you and helps you let go of any negativity from your day, then this is a good CD to have in your collection!Both meditations focus on Centering, Balancing, and Clearing your Chakras, first: for maximum potential during your day, and second: for a restful recooperative night sleep."
4,Insightful,"At first I was skeptical, however after some practice and meditation, I find myself feeling more calm and relaxed. Hopefully as I get better at meditation, other benefits will come. Amazing how difficult it is for me to get still!"
1,This should have been better,"Okay, Chicago had two legendary albums on their heels, and they turn around and record this turkey. Not a single song stands out as memorable. The only ones even worth a listen are ""Flight 602, which as another reviewer said, is similar to Crosby, Stills, and Nash, the first three minutes of Sing A Mean Tune Kid, Free, and Lowdown. The rest are sadly terrible. James Pankow is a genius, but even his Elegy suite fails to catch fire. Terry Kath's Hour In the Shower does not justify his guitar wizardry. This is one of the few times that I can honestly say Chicago put out a really bad album."
3,im not sure if is dynomax muffler,"these it's the first muffler that I buy and I'm not sure if is from dynomax because don't say anything on the muffler, any way these muffler decrease a lot the sound in comparisons with my other broken muffler, it's cheap and it's works, also looks like aluminum."
5,Ken Burns National Parks. America's Best Idea,"This series of six DVDs can & should, be watched by all who are able to do so. The beauty of the photography of our National Parks and the narration that accompanies these pictures is amazing. I certainly recomend it for all family and public viewing, as it has been on PBS. It is a great addition to my video library, and will be viewed over and over again.Being a Yosemite Native, born and raised in that wonderful Park, I have a special place in my heart for Yosemite, but still find all the other National Parks amazing places to visit and treasure."
5,National Parks by Ken Burns,This series is amazing. I watched it on PBS and then purchased the series for our collecion.
5,Best Documentary EVER,"The Very Best Idea, with the best research and photography.What a lovely way of seen again all those specials places, where you can be with your god or try to find yourselves, or see the history of THE EARTH.Far away the best North americans legacy!!Omar Babul- CHILE"
5,"Wonderful Series, Even Better in Blu-Ray","I ordered these DVDs after my husband had watched most of the series already on TV. He switched to the Blu-Ray discs and was really impressed with the clarity. As usual, Ken Burns has done a wonderful job of telling ""the story behind the story"". I have been to many of the national parks featured, and learned a lot of new information about every one of them. If you like nature, history and beautiful photography, you owe it to yourself to watch this series."
2,Not a Documentary about the Parks,"This is NOT a documentary about the parks. It is about the history, an during the first 120 minutes (I just could not make it any further), it is a random collection of people marveling abut the parks. Absolutely boring.I still gave 2 stars because had I read the description more thoroughly, I should have known that it is not about the parks."
1,Disappointed,"Ken Burns: National Parks Set - America's Best Idea (Set of 6 DVDs Plus CD Soundtrack)If you are expecting a visual tour or even a current description of our parks, this is not the series to select. You will be bounced back and forth from park to park, often with old black-and-white photos. The focus is on the politics of park establishment and the philosophy and theology of the founder of the Sierra Club. The monotonous fawning of this founder by those historians and writers chosen for interviews is pitiful. The series is not an armchair visit to the national parks."
1,defective....,"the 6 cd product i received , had 2 completely bad cd's. not very happy at all with the product. now , the fun will begin with returning 1 dvd , and getting another , without being charged double...."
5,Masterpiece!,"This historical work is a real eye opener. Thank the good Lord for inspiring those great American nature lovers. Every good gift and every perfect gift comes from above, from the Father of lights. What great foresight to preserve our country's great natural wonders. Ken Burns, I applaud you, your team and PBS for this great gift. I am watching the entire series for the second time in two weeks. Some parts I have watched 3-4 times."
2,A long documentary that misses the main topic,"For a foreigner who loves National Parks, I choose this documentary to learn more about them. This doc uses the storyline of the NPs to diverge on the ideal of United States, the so called American way. I do not think it is the place of a pretending documentary to incline its storyline so much in favor of a society's aspiration and dogma. It is also clearly biased in terms of religion, refering way too much to Christianism concepts.I gave it 2 stars because it still does cover the history of National Parks, but it could have done it in more elegant, neutral and factual manner."
4,Nice flick,Nice show...I'm a Ken Burns fan. You won't go wrong with this one. If your a prime member its free..so why not watch it?
3,almost got this,"I *was* going to buy two copies of this as a gift for myself and one for a relative, but they hiked the price from $38 to $70, I'm assuming just in time for the holidays."
3,"sometimes interesting, sometimes dull, could have been better","overall, the series was informative, but i found the narration & pacing a little dull. i think if they added more live shots of the parks & also featured more of the park animals, it'd would have been more rewarding to watch like the Planet Earth series, which was never boring to watch."
5,Priceless,"I was fortunate to be able to see the premier of National Parks on the big screen at the Telluride Mountainfilm Festival this year. I had intended to see only the first show of the 12-hour series but was so blown away that I planned the rest of my weekend around the series and saw them all. While the cinematography is absolutely outstanding, what impressed me most was the human drama that unfolds in each episode. Ken Burns can tell stories like no one else can on film. It is truly an amazing and inspirational film series that should be seen by anyone who loves nature, history, people, politics, and the overall drama that unfolded as our country developed."
5,The National Parks: America's Best Idea,I can highly recommend this series. I watched it on TV and enjoyed it so much that I wanted to own it.
2,National Parks yawn,"I bought this DVD set for my husband with high expectations, having read some fine reviews.Normally, we would both love this kind of thing, certainly love the subject matter but we were both fast asleep after an hour!The pace of the filming, the repetitive style, the dreary music without any change in the rhythm.. both of commentary or filming, made the whole thing drag.While I can see the need to take a slow amble through the nature's wonders in order to appreciate its riches when you are out there in the midst of it all, it just didn't work for me, in my arm chair, watching my TV!!Disappointing!"
1,Misnamed and Poorly Done,"See my full review under the DVD version.This is not really about the National Parks; it is really about the people and politics of making the National Parks.You will not be seeing much of the actual National Parks here. And what you do see will be repetitive, archival, and poorly done.Rent it.Check it out from the Library.Borrow it from someone that has it.See it on TV.But don't buy it until you HAVE seen it, and know for sure you want it."
2,Good history-----too much politics,i have a complete set. It is a thorough history of the creation of the National Parks with beautiful scenery. If only they had toned down the sappy Sierra Club propaganda which is inserted throughout by PBS environmental sycophants.
1,the national parks: americas best idea,the last 3 dvd's of a 6 dvd set will not play. the first 3 dvd's do play. the same problem occured with the previous set that was returned. not very good performance for an $80 outlay. Amazon shoul question their supplier.
3,Not what I expected,"Thought this would have unique insight into each of our national parks with a great deal of footage. Instead it was a history of the creation of the parks with most footage being very old, very little current content. If you are looking for this type of history, you will be happy with this set, but if you are looking for videos and descriptions of our parks to whet your appetite for visiting them, look elsewhere."
1,Skipping dvd,Sadly this video was defective and I will have to send it back. Whenever there was a shot of an individual talking the words were unintelligible.
2,ugly twanging guitars constantly playing in the background,"I looked forward to watching the program on PBS but after half a hour I turned off the TV and went to bed. Why? The program that could have been marvelous was completely ruined for me by the incessant background noise, ugly noise, of twanging guitars playing on and on and on and on and on, even when people were speaking. It was so obnoxious and my relief was so great when, for a short while, the noise stopped, that I decided I simply couldn't take it any longer and turned off the TV. If somehow you could keep the narration and get rid of the background noise the program would be fine. But I am sure that can't be done."
4,Chicago VI is a good album,"I enjoy listening to this album. It includes two classics: 'Feelin' Stronger Every Day', and 'Just You 'N Me'. I have to laugh every time I hear 'Jenny'. The only dissappointment for me was that I would have liked to hear more of Terry Kath in this album."
5,What can i say...,"Now I'm not gonna sit hear and try to lay out all the reason's one should listen to this CD. What i will say is just get it and listen to it,you won't be disappointed!!"
5,CD of Soul,"I've enjoyed CHI VI for the more soulful songs, Darlin' Dear, Hollywood and Critics' Choice, but what a surprise when I opened the re-master today! Yes it is Al Green on the final track, yes Chicago is jamming on Tired of Being Alone! This CD could'nt be any better, in addition, there's track 11, Beyond Our Sorrows, more Terry !! Yeah !! It's great to have ""extra"" songs after Feelin' Stronger Everyday, and the sound is awesome. I'm waiting for the next re-master release....."
4,Chicago`s Greastist Achievment,"With tracks like `just you and Me`& feeling stronger everyday this is Chicago at their best. A Very good balence of mid tempo rock & moving ballads makes this recording a real treat to listen to. Peter Cetera`s Cool smoothing voice was at its height here, this was the first recording i have heard of the group and its still my faverite. It is one of my faverite album of the seventies when music was realistic and fun to listen to and had more purpose on the changing times."
3,"A bit poppy, but still plenty of fun","The cracks in Chicago's armor began to appear on this album, although they would have one more truly great one on their next outing.How you feel about this album may depend largely on how much you like the singles. ""Just You 'N' Me"" and ""Feelin' Stronger Every Day"" are both fine songs, but not my personal favorites. I actually prefer the fast soul tune ""What's The World Comin' To?"" (which opens with some random studio sounds and a voice -- is it Lamm's? -- saying ""we can cut it in ANY key,"" before Lamm, Cetera, and Kath evenly trade off lead vocals ... there may even be a fourth singer doing the bass interjections).As one reviewer noted, ""Jenny"" is just kind of silly. I would add that ""Darlin' Dear"" is a little too cutesy. Other cuts are merely okay. ""In Terms Of Two"" is a big clue of how Cetera's songwriting would come to dominate the band's work in the future.One had little clue how great the next album would be."
2,Still Chicago but strays from the style of previous albums,Still a Chicago sound and worth a listen but not the driving sound of previous albums. After purchasing VI and VII I quit buying Chicago albums as it didn't sound like the same band. This album was a disappointment to me
4,What ... are you smoking?,">Remember for all you CHICAGO fans,this is the next to last>album you will hear Terry Kath,playing guitarReally? I thought that would be X? XI was the last one with Kath.CTA and II are my personal favorites."
3,Inconsistent but Still a Must-Have,"Some of the songs here are so bad they're painful to listen to (such as ""Critic's Choice"").But there are some brilliant ones here, too, meaning that you have to get this album. ""Just You And Me"" is some of their best singing and instrumental playing, for example.""Darling Dear"" is strong albeit a little compromised. ""What's This World Coming To"" offers a strangely optimistic message which is hard to resist. ""In Terms of Two"" is great fun and very listenable, if a little unusual as an admixture of styles.And then, ""Something in this City Changes People"" is the first inkling of the downer stuff to come - expressing disillusionment with the fruits of success is honest, but not necessarily interesting.[sigh] You just have to buy it, whether you want to or not..."
2,Doesn't Measure Up,"Although ""Feelin' Stronger Every Day"" and ""Just You 'n' Me"" were big hits, the rest of this album has a lot of weak material. In short, Chicago VI is a weak and uninspired album that can--and should--be ignored by Chicago fans.The only other songs on this album that merit some consideration are ""Something in This City Changes People"", ""In Terms of Two"" and maybe ""Critic's Choice"". Other than that, there's not much here on this album to recommend it to any serious Chicago fan."
2,Terd Sandwich (aka How I Wasted a Perfectly Good Night),Twas the night before Columbus DayAnd all through the houseThis game is f***in terrible...No that's it.This game sucks.
1,Save your money,"Save your money, this DVD only covers very basic things at a very high level and is more like a sales brochure than an actual instructional video. You are better off reading ""Speed Secrets"" or ""Going Faster (Skip Barber book)"". Most of the content is also freely available to watch on the HookedOnDriving website. Save your money for more seat time at track days with the instructors where you will learn a whole lot more."
2,"Great Gift, but should not be used for brewing.","This is a beautiful teapot, but I recently purchased a lead test kit and used it on the teapot's exterior out of curiosity. The paint used contains lead, so much that it showed positive in the first swab. I would not recommend this product, as well made as it is, to be used for anything you ingest."
5,Cast Iron at a bargain price,The tea pot arrived as promised and holds a good amount of tea which was important as so many of the cast iron pots are very small. The cost was very reasonable compared to many of the specialty tea shops and I was able to find matching cups and saucers elsewhere to put together a lovely set at less than half what I would have spent.
3,"Nice teapot, bad packing","This teapot is very nice. The shipper does a poor job in packing a heavy weight item. The exterior box was undamaged. The interior box holding the teapot was broken in two places by the teapot when it was subject to normal shipping forces. The teapot was in good shape with the exception of scrapes exposing bare metal from shipping. The problem is two fold one not enough packing to keep the interior box from sliding around in the exterior box; two the scrapes could have been prevented by bubble rap around the teapot.I just touched up the teapot with paint and let the vendor know the above, I did not ask for exchange.Bottom line, if you purchase anything heavy from this shipper expect it to come damaged in minor ways. Only a real problem if you are sending it as a gift."
2,Not for me..I'll keep looking,I am willing to spend the money because I have sensitive skin if it is a good product. . . but this one caused me to break out.
3,Must have been a bad tube!,"I have always loved Laura Mercier products. I have extremely oily skin. So, I am always looking for oil free foundations that will cover. I saw this was a new product and couldn't wait to try it. When my Amazon order arrived, I opened the tube and squeezed it, I noticed all that came out was a clear liquid. Eventually, some makeup did come out. Anyway, the watery substance continued to spray out each time I tried to use it. Finally, I visited a store and asked to see the same makeup. The makeup was perfect! I ended up buying a tube at the store. Now that I have good tube, I love the makeup! Check your tube as soon as you get it from Amazon. Maybe you can return yours if you notice the watery substance spraying from your tube."
2,Very disappointed!,"Since Laura Mercier seems to be a respected name in cosmetics, I expected a lot more. The appearance was fine but I found the foundation very difficult to apply. I tried with a sponge, with my fingers and also with and without foundation primer and I found it difficult to apply smoothly. It took a lot longer than my regular foundation (L'Oreal) to apply and the end result looked basically the same~ for a lot more money. I will definitely not buy this or Laura Mercier's primer again. I usually use Bare Essentuals or Smashbox primers and this foundation was easier to apply with them but still not satisfactory."
4,Great for acne/scars/blotchy skin,"I've been looking for some good makeup to help cover up my moderate pitted acne scars on my cheeks and lower jaw. I also get the occasional zit that leaves red marks. I'm on day one of using this stuff and so far I'm really impressed. It doesn't cover everything up completely (I was hoping it was magic!) but I guess I can't expect miracles. My skin looks really, really, good.The only thing I'd say is make sure you skin is well moisturized before applying. I had some dry patches from using benz. peroxide on acne and it became a little flaky/cakey. Used the fairest shade (even though I have pink undertones) and love that it's not too orange for my skin tone.Definitely worth the money--a little goes a very long way and spreads out evenly. I don't know what I was thinking buying bad drugstore stuff for so long when I have the kind of scars/skin tone I do. Invest in something good!"
5,awsome is all I can say.,"this is great make up...it covers great and makes ur face look so smooth,,I love it awsome is all i can say"
4,Great Foundation,So I bought this for my sister because I know she loves it along with tons of other girls I can't personally say how this product is but everyone I know loves it. An the shipping was great and very fast. 100% Authentic product.
3,Not for sensitive skin,"This is a high-quality product but is not suited for someone with sensitive or oily-prone skin. It caused a lot of patchy bumps on my skin, feels heavy, and makes my skin very shiny, causing the need to powder throughout the day."
4,Good for mature skins,"Laura Mercier Silk Creme FoundationThis foundation is also excellent for the ""more mature"" woman. Use it over the Laura Mercier Hydrating Primer for easy application. I do not use a sponge to apply it because it wastes the product. Instead I use my fingers. A very small amount gives a lot of coverage. You can dab on a little more on areas that are hyperpigmented from sun exposure to completely hide them. I am nearing my 70th birthday mark and haven't had any ""work"" done on my face so I see lines emerging and getting deeper. I had used Alexandra DeMarkoff's Countess Isserlyn prior to Laura Mercier for many years but started to find it too oily and so switched. Be careful about sellers charging over 57 dollars for this foundation. It retails for 42 dollars at Bloomingdales."
3,I love Laura Mercier products,I love Laura Mercier products but this wasn't my favorite as I'm not sure I got the best color for me. I got Bamboo beige & wasn't as happy w/it as I am w/tinted moisturizer. It cakes a little I think as well.
1,Lipsticknet retailer,"Ordered this item from lipsticknet. This company not only never sent me my item but sent it to an entirely different state then when they realized it and spoligized they said they would immediately send me out a replacement since I was waiting so long. Waited another week and a half contacted them they said their inventory was depleted and couldn't send me a replacement that I had to wait for them to get the original item they sent to the wrong state to come back to them !?! Wtf? Horrible customer service, I sincevthenbirdered the product through Macy's and it came slmost immediately! Lipsticknet will never get any business from me again. My product from Macy's was just what I expected and I'm in love with Laura Mercier products!!!"
5,Best New thing To hit the USA,This CD is awsome. The band members are also very cool. They are very nice. The songs on this cd are really great and should be heard by everyone. I bout 6 just so my friends can hear this cool band. I am going to spread the word at my college about them. The Song Rescue is a great song.
4,Don't order from Champs Sports,"Shoes are great, but don't order from Champs Sport if you have any other option unless you don't mind receiving you item well after you need them. It takes at least a day before Amazon gives them the order and then another 2 days before they even process it. Shoe hasn't even left the warehouse. I ordered it on a Wednesday and didn't even get it shipped out of the warehouse til Monday and expected time to get to my place? 11 days. Item usually ships in 24 hours. Be mindful of the word usually. Yes I am bitter."
4,great video,"I had seen Martin Hale's ""Wild Gardens"" on KVCR and enjoyed it so much. I was thrilled to be able to purchase a copy to share with my family and friends. If you enjoy being out in nature, you will surely enjoy this series. Can't wait for the rest of the series to be released."
3,NOT THE BEST !,I have seen ten different compilations of this band and here the track selection is not the best. There are some better comps.
1,Not the Noah's Ark Little Golden Book I was wanting,"This was a lightly used book and couldn't complain about that, but it was not the version of the Little Golden Book Noah's Ark I was looking for. I had the book when I was a small child and although the year published seemed about right, the words were entirely different. I had no idea there would be more than one version published."
3,Reasonble balls,These Basketballs are reasanoble but not great. I ordered them for the basketball team Penta (That's in the Netherlands) but these balls are not great as indoor balls. Next time I'll order the official NBA balls only those are more expensive.The leather is not great but if you're looking for an allround ball you can order this one. The silver NBA is vanishing very fast by the way.excuse me for my bad English but i'm not a US citizen (I'm Dutch)
4,Nice approach (for physicists),"If you studied Mathematical Physics or if you like the mathematical approach that physicists used to write their papers and lectures, it 's a pleasant book to understand wavelets."
5,Good Book,"Before reading this book, read the wavelet chapter fromDigital Image Processing (2nd Edition)by Rafael C. Gonzalez, Richard E. Woods"
2,disappointing,"If you read the product description and are intrested in this movie then I guessing you probaly interested in the potential for titilation. Unless you're someone who thinks spanking is the best thing that can happen in a movie, the you'll be disappointed by this movie. There is no nudity, no S&M, and the acting isn't as good as what you can find in a porn movie. The only reason I gave this movie two stars instead of one is because the storyline, its twists and turns makes you wonder who really is the villian, and what motivates certain characters."
2,misbehavior,it was not worth the money. was not what was expected. would not have rented if there were more reviews.
1,Dumb Da Dumb Dumb Dumb!!!!,I will agree with Ally....this movie is not worth purchasing and also even if it was free I won't even watch it. I also think it was a waste of time and money.
2,not very good.,"It wasn't the worst movie ever, but overall it wasn't very good. Had some spanking scenes, but hinted at more."
2,A weird and only intermittently interesting story,"This seems to be about naughty schoolgirls getting their comeuppance from a kinky teacher. Then it turns out that at least some of it is consensual and others are involved. DVDs are being made, and by someone the main girl would least suspect. At least it is a bit entertaining."
4,Sweet and moving story (B+ Grade),"Mary Spencer writes a wonderful story with two remarkable characters. Margot has a horrible stutter but doesn't let that limit herself. Ever since she was a young girl, she has loved Eric who was kind to her when others were mean to her because of her stutter. Now he comes back into her life to protect her from a foul villian who wants to marry her for unscrupulous reasons.Their loves grows as they journey from her home into the safety of his. There are also many wonderful secondary characters such as Eric's brothers and Margot's best friend.There is also enough passion but doesn't go too far for those who are squemish with steamy love scenes. Overall a sweet story. Margot is a gem and Eric a true hero.If you like stories set during the Middle Ages with intrigue, passion and unduring love, check out The Vow.KatiebabsHonor"
1,Not worth the time it takes to read it,If you find the computer animated Cita from the BET show Cita's World offensive then this book won't change your opinion. It reads like it was written for and by semi-literates. If you think rap music and it's lessons are true representations of black life then you'll love the book. For anyone else it's not worth the time or money.
5,The Diva Is Back!,"This is one of the best dance songs out there and it's not surprising with a voice like Vicki Sue singing it! This is a great song, a great mix and her voice is amazing. We can only hope that this is just a preview of an album to come."
1,Not worth the money,"Toner does not adhere, you can wipe it off with your finger. Pay the money and get the real thing!"
4,Interesting and vivid look at sexualized violence in Weimar Germany,"This is a fascinating book that deals with sex and violence during the Weimar republic in Germany (1919-1933). This is not a book for the lay person, it's an academic study. I found it extremely interesting, and at times disturbing. It's primarily an academic text, however I found it interesting and accessible even though this historical period is not one that I've studied."
2,And you wonder why they fired Guercio?,"This album would be perfect if James Guercio spent less time ensuring that every conceivable concert photo were given to the consumer in the original LP box set and spent more time checking that the vocals and horn section were mixed properly. The recording problems detract from what otherwise would be quite a comprehensive collection. Try ""Live in Japan"" instead."
3,Overwhelming; too much of a good thing?,"It seems like they tried to fit almost everything in one package this time, a 4-LP live set with wall posters, etc., following on the heels of 3 double-albums. But between including possibly TOO much, I'm afraid it suffers from a lack of sound quality that MOST live albums of the time had. While 3 CDs are much more convenient to actually PLAY than 8 LP sides (especially if you have a CD-changer) I'm afraid this still takes a poor second-place for me to the CHICAGO LIVE IN JAPAN album, recorded only a year or so later."
3,"It's not too much, it's too little","...too little attention paid on the behind the scenes work that went into developing (or not) this project. This set contains many of the great tunes that Chicago put together early in their career. It's just too bad that the sound on this set doesn't do the band justice.This CD set is for serious die-hard fans, but there are better live recordings to choose from."
2,"Do yourself a favor, avoid this CD","This CD, while very comprehensive, is woeful to listen to. The recordings sound like papercup and string quality, and the performances on the whole are well below standard. The band itself is ashamed of this set. Buy the ""Chicago live in Japan"" CD to enjoy them in a high quality sound, and good perfomance setting."
2,CD packaging leaves much to be desired,"Much of the fun of this release on vinyl has been lost in the transfer to CD. First, the 12-page ""booklet"" notes the original album photographs ""could not be properly reproduced."" What a LAME cop-out! I find this impossible to believe. Also, the original ebb-and-flow of the original 8-side set is spread across 3 CDs. There should be at least some note of where the original album breaks were.The actual recording is worthy of 3-stars, but this ""bad old days"" CD transfer lowers my feelings about this set to 2."
2,Pomp & Circumstance,"After releasing three consecutive double albums, Chicago did the unthinkable by releasing a four record live album. Chicago IV (Live at Carnegie Hall) is the record that Chicago bashers love to point at as the height of the band's bombast. To a degree, the critics are correct in their statement. The album does contain some fine renditions of hits like ""Beginnings"", ""Colour My World"" & ""Questions 67 & 68"" as well as lesser known tracks like ""Free"" and ""Lowdown"". But mostly it is an overblown affair with no better example of excess than the five movements of ""It Better End Soon"". Chicago have been unfair whipping boys for the rock press through the years, but on this release, they help give ammunition to their critics."
5,Jewelry Lapidary Reference,Oh my goodness! Such a great resource for information on all aspects of lapidary and jewelry design! This is a must-have reference!
1,Old fashioned even when it was first published,"I was looking for a basic introduction to lapidary work to actually try to cut stones and found the book old-fashioned and outdated. Many of the illustrations, however, were hilarious. Not a clue on how to cut your own stones and a waste of time and money from this standpoint, but if you are interested in grainy pictures of late 19th century stone cutting in Germany, this is the book for you."
2,A beginning book.,"This book is so basic that it is almost useless. Each subject matter is introduced so briefly that very little help is provided. If you know absolutely nothing about working with rocks and minerals then it is a start, otherwise choose a better book."
3,"Not bad, not great","For the title having the word welcome in it, I felt this book could have been a little bit more interesting. It was quite informative, but it was a little dry and boring. All the facts are there, but I think as an introduction the church, it should have been more captivating."
4,excellent intro to the episcopalian church,"The Episcopalian Church has a rich and varied history that I was unaware of until I read this book. Unfortunatly, the episcopal Church is going through a rough time with some left wing political types. As shown in the recent ordaining of that openly gay bishop."
4,Interesting but reads like textbook,"Very informative!! Main complaint is that it reads like a textbook. If the book is a ""welcome"", it should have more spark. However, information within the book is well organized and presented . Having become a member of the Episcopal Church some 30 years ago as a teenager I found the book very interesting and informative. Would recommend it to both church members and non-church members."
2,Wheres the OOMPH and the feeling? Not here...,"As with many follow ups this year Nonpoint disappoints, straying from their roots of in your face, yet melodic, rap-rock. The only hard song on the album is Excessive Reaction, and is softer than the softest song on Statement (What A Day). Had this been their debut, it could have gotten 3 stars...but I know that they are capable of so much more. Hopefully they can bounce back in 2004 with a new opus"
5,GREAT STAEMENT,"THE NEW CD IS A MASTERPIECE OF GREAT VOX AND GUITAR RIFFS ,THE BEST CUTS ARE CICLES AND MY OWN SAKE, THERE IS GREAT GUITAR RIFFS ON EVER SONGS RANGING FROM THE SOUNDS OF SEVNDUST TO KORN"
4,Statement was good and so is Development!,"i got this cd the day is came out and at first listen when i was completly done, i noticed that this was not as hard. But still i love it every song is growing on me. I seriously think Nonpoint are the king of hooks. All their songs are really cathcy and get stuck in your head. Every song on this cd is good in its own way. If your dont like this Nonpoint well then you didnt like them from Statement as much as you thought you did. The reason i give it 4 stars is because its going ot be hard as hell to top Statement which was an incredible cd. And also what a better way to learn about frogs! The cd has little scientific loops about FROGS it goes through the whole cd, i think its pretty cool,it was a good idea."
2,No way!,"I can't believe it. I was so excited about this release that I almost wet myself when the 25th actually did roll around. I haven't actually awaited a release since BOC's ""Club Ninja."" Well, as with that musical fiasco from '86, Nonpoint's latest really disappoints.Let's discuss ""Statement."" What a wonderful album. Not a weak song on it. If you already own it, you know what I'm talking about. If you don't, buy it instead.Now let's discuss ""Development."" Uh. Um. Boring. First song rocks. Er. It's about frogs. That's about it. Other than to say that, at times, it sounds kinda like some throwaway alternative from the late 80's.Gone are the wonderful riffs, melodious hooks and edgy vocals. Gone is any singing in Spanish. Gone is anything with any real punch. Gone is any interest. My head's hung as low as the average beats per minute on this album..."
1,What happened to these guys?!!,"These guys used to have a pretty heavy sound - they had some killer guitar riffs on their first national release. They were originally a very heavy band, then they softened up a little bit for their major label debut, but now they sound like freakin' Hoobastank. If you appreciated the heaviness of ""Statement,"" then do not, I repeat DO NOT waste your money on this album. Pick up the new Soulfly album instead. If, however, your idea of ""metal"" is bands like Linkin Park and Papa Roach, maybe this CD is for you."
3,Great Single... but that's pretty much it,"I'm gonna shoot this one straight. Nonpoint's first single off this album, ""Your Signs"" was definitely one of the best songs i've heard last year. In an age where it seems harder and harder to find good nu metal bands, this band seems to pull through... HOWEVER, the rest of the cd was nothing more than a dissapointment to me. It's nothing compared to their older stuff: Victim, What a Day, Endure etc... But despite all that, I'm still a Nonpoint fan... just because of ""Your Signs"". If you're trying to find GOOD nu metal where bands have more than a few good songs on an album, look into Lifer."
3,"Going, Going, Gone!!!","Well, it seems nonpoint, a band who I had high hopes for, has become the latest metal band to reach mediocrity. Don't get me wrong, this is not a terrible cd, some of the songs are well done (mint, the last track, comes to mind). The musicianship is tight, but the songs just seem to be missing something. This album is considerably less heavy than statement, which was disappointing to me. You nu-metal guys will love this stuff, eat it up."
2,Staement on meds,"I got Statement a couple years ago and it has been one of my favorite rock/metal albums in my collection since. I picked up Development when I saw it on sale at a local music shop. What a disappointment. The title track is pretty good but the rest of the disc does anything but rock. It's mostly the lyrics/singing. It doesn't sound like the same singer from Statement (maybe it's not). This album has none of the intensity of their former. There are choruses like ""Making mountains out of molehills"". WTF is that?! It apears the singer has been on some type of medication that has taken off the edge. It might be good for his personal life, but the music suffers. If you like Statement (which I would recommend to any hard rock/metal fan) you will most likely feel let down w/ this one."
2,Biggest disappointment of the year.,"I thought Nonpoint's CD ""Statement"" was one of the best CD's in 2000. I rocked non-stop and kept the heavy riffs grinding. But here on ""Development"", things are just too slow and mellow, almost as if Nonpoint were trying to be something they're not. Now I know mellow isn't always a bad thing, but doesn't it seem as though too many artists these days are turning to melodic styles to not get labeled as an immature nu-metal band? Nonpoint even said the reason they went mellow was to get exposure. If you are a true Nonpoint fan as I am, you should get it. Otherwise, invest your money in their first CD and hope that this was just a case of sophomore slump."
3,What happened?????!!,"This album really let me down. I was expecting something awesome here and it just didnt do it. Dont get me wrong I am a huge Nonpoint fan. The cd does have some cool tracks on it. The import has 2 extra tracks on it, but Evil Walls is the better of the two. Overall this cd is cool but (in my opinion) there are better Nonpoint albums out there like Statement, and Recoil, and To the pain."
1,Development doesn't even deserve even 1 star,"This CD is a disgrace to all music. I mean the lyrics are very cheesy and the song structures are sorry. I used to like this disgrace of a genre known as nu-metal, but I grew up and started listening to the real stuff. If you want to listen to real metal or anything like it, just listen to bands like Suffocation (I know some of you may not like death metal or any at all), Nothingface, Nevermore (awesome American power metal), or Kataklysm.Edit 9/6/2012: This album fell into the ""sophomore slump"" even though at the time I wrote the review I was being pretentious but my overall opinion still stands. Their subsequent albums are a lot better than this one. Please take a look at those and even their debut before looking at this one. This is my least favorite album by them."
1,I WANT MY MONEY BACK!,"It was the worst instructional video I have ever seen. The camera used was of the poorest sort, probably a personal handycam. The entire video mostly showed the head Sensei going through forms in rapid succession, that is it! No insight into proper form, no helpful hints, nothing about how to properly hold the attackers hand when doing certain moves. All in all about the same as watching an Aikido demonstration from a distance. Save your money"
2,LACK LUSTER,"IT WAS BORING, OVER MUCH OF THE MOVIE WAS THE CROSSING OF THE DESERT.NO RECOMMENDATIONIT WAS A WAR MOVIE, POOR EXCUSE FOR AN WESTERN"
2,"A regrettable, forgettable effort","I finally saw this film in its entirety recently, being a fan of much of the cast, and was mightily disappointed. Little to recommend here, save the cinematography and the breasts of Claudia Cardinale. Robert Ryan has hardly any lines at all. Woody Strode has a demeaning role as an errand boy for the white actors around him. Lee Marvin is so taciturn it's almost like he's imitating himself. Some of the dialogue is laugh-out-loud bad. There's a lengthy, nonsensical standoff between Lancaster and the chief bandito. And the ending will have you scratching your head as well."
3,"It's no ""Magnificent Seven...""","Another western. This has the promising markings of a pleasantly formulaic film -- four men, each a specialist in his field, are hired to do a big job in Zapata-era Mexico. Unfortunately, the movie is plodding and emotionally uninvolving. Robert Ryan was too old for his role; Lee Marvin, Woody Strode and Burt Lancaster are all adequately cool, but nothing really catches fire here. It's kind of nice to see the aged, yet ever-oily Ralph Bellamy in a later role as the tycoon who sends the heroes off on their mission; Claudia Cardinale also stars as a Raquel Welch wannabee. Some stuff blows up and todos los banditos hablan espanol. But no big whoop, really."
5,Whole > Parts,"The cast is superb. But ... the story is so-so, the direction is blah, and the dialog is trite. Nevertheless, this film is outstanding. It's a case of the whole being much, much greater than the sum of its parts. To this day, this picture belongs in the same company as The Magnificent Seven, The Dirty Dozen, and The Wild Bunch ... desperate men on a desperate mission doing desperate things. Lee Marvin is excellent. Burt Lancaster is Burt Lancaster. Woody Strode always brings integrity to every role he plays. Robert Ryan is perfect as the stoic horsey expert. Add Jack Palance as Jesus and you've got two hours on film that makes today's Hollywood look stupid. This film has passed the test of time. You are reading this review 40+ years after the film was released. Do you really think lots of people will be sitting around in 40 years (if there's anything left to sit on) talking about a Heigl and a Kutcher?"
5,A classic Western beautifully presented on Blu-ray!,"I bought this after reading about it on the net, having never seen the movie. This is a man movie, make no mistake. Burt Lancaster. Lee Marvin. Jack Palance. What more needs to be said? The characters are cool, the action is well scripted, the dialog near-perfect, and the cinematography is beautiful. The sound is surprisingly good for a 40+ year old flick. Sony did this Blu-ray right...no nasty DNR to smear away details and remove grain here...you will believe you are watching film. I didn't notice any video artifacts on my 50"" Sony A3000 SXRD HDTV. Lee Marvin's line at the end of the movie is priceless. And it's only $19.95 on Amazon. Great movie, great Blu-ray transfer, great price. Buy it."
4,Old Times,"I remember wathing this movie on tele with the family. Then, there was censorship for delicate ears and eyes. Now, I can hear the ""primetime profanity"" and see the slight nudity. One thing that lets this flick ""outshine"" most of today's cineramic fare, is the depth of the quality of the acting."
5,One of the best movies ever made!!!,"This movie has it ALL! Taut direction, beautiful cinematography, sweeping musical score, an incredably literate script with the catchiest lines ever spoken on the screen, and the best acting of the experianced casts' careers. From the opening scenes to the unexpected conclusion, this movie grips your attention all the way. Just when you think the action can't get any better, the plot turns on a dime and off you're off in a different direction at breakneck speed. I am a consumate movie buff and have seen thousands of films, but none with the powerful punch of this one. It is the only film I sat through twice in the theater. I couldn't believe the realism, rugged beauty, and magnetism of these veteran stars. This one can not be topped."
4,classic flim to have.,"Great western flim, classic story and great actors in the film too.a must have for your collection. I like it."
5,One of the best,"Burt Lancaster, Lee Marvin, Robert Ryan and Woody Strode make this flick great. Hired by a train baron to bring back his kidnapped wife, they soon find that all is not what it seems. The acting is terse and intense and, for all the twists and turns, you're still left wondering what happens next when the movie ends. Not a lot of gunfights and explosions, although there's enough to satisfy. Instead, it's the mental game of cat and mouse that takes the forefront here and delivers pretty good."

4,Unusual and welcome,"As I read more and more about old jazzmen, it is striking just how many died early or unnecessary deaths. ""Jazz and Death""fills an unusual and worthwhile niche.The only complaint I have is that Dr. Spencer tends to editorialize at length on the justifications for marijuana laws, etc. Not that I don't agree completely. He also (in the introduction -and- the conclusion) draws attention to the very tenuous links between the history of jazz and the history of medicine.A wonderful and engrossing read."
3,[sic]...Indeed!!,"Please, Mr. Spencer, considering the research you must have put into this book, you could at least spell Thelonious Monk's name correctly. You used ""Thelonius"" throughout the book, so it wasn't just a typo. Or maybe, your Editor was to blame?"
3,"Good, but dated and not for all artists","This is a good starting overview of how to get started as a serious and/or professional artist, as long as you keep two things in mind:1, it was written in 1997, and certain sections (particularly promotion) are too dated to be helpful in the age of the Internet.2, it is written from the perspective of the ""art world"" scene, and if you aren't a painter, or perhaps a sculptor, you are not going to get a lot out of this book."
3,USB supplied battery pack - Older model,"This model has lasted me well for about two years now. The only issue I have had is that the small plastic switch has broken off, meaning I have to use a sharp car key to turn the power on and off. It will charge my 2nd-gen iPod classic twice before being completely discharged, or provide power while the device is in use."
5,iPod battery Energizer,Very satisfied with the product. Works very well on coast to coast flights. Recommend.
3,Hey! At least its an improvement over Chicago 13.,"Chicago XIV stands for the proposition that the whole may be less than the sum of its parts. There are no bad songs on XIV. Some actually show that some energy still remained in the group. The overall album however reveals a tired band. Perhaps the commercial and critical self inflicted black eye from Chicago 13 took its toll. The standout contributions are Lamm's ""Manipulation"" and ""I'd Rather Be Rich"". Both contain an aggresive rythym and horn section, along with Lamm's cynical wit. Pankow's ""American Dream"" showed there was still some politcal commentary bubbling under the surface. ""Thunder and Lightening"" also has some energy. The simple lyrics and production of ""Song for You"" will tend to draw the listener to repeated playbacks. Its worth seeking out, after you have bought most of their other selections."
2,I Just Don't Get It,"Everyone keeps telling me this is a classic. I think it's just awful. It reads like it was written: a rambling, unedited, ill-considered, weakly plotted piece of whimsy jotted down by an ailing old lady... was riding her reputation here - Macabea is just someone who comes and goes. This novel just isn't finished."
1,Oh God,"I could barely get through this book when I read it. My IB English class made us read it then analyze it like any other books, but this one was just horrible. The narrator contradicts himself all the time and the misused punctuation? Unbelievable. It drove me crazy.I love to read, but I honestly just want to burn the thing. Completely useless and a waste of paper in my opinion."
3,"Ok, but not a greenlee","This bit works ok in soft woods, but bogs down in hardwood (with a 18v cordless drill) whereas the Greenlee naileater just keeps going. The temper of the metal used in this bit is not very good for nails either."
4,Good information and how to tips........,A very good book to have in your library or tack room. Good information and directions. Handy reference for years to come.
5,WAY better than the local GF Bakery,"While you can't make bread like it looks on the cover, you can make simply awesome bread with this mix. You don't even have to toast it, or slather it with butter or other toppings. I LOVE it. It's also so easy to make."
5,Great GF Bread,"While the texture isn't exactly like real french bread, this bread mix makes a really good tasting gluten free load of bread. I followed the directions exactly (using the melted butter and sugar) and really enjoyed it. It's crusty on the outside and soft on the inside w/ no icky gluten free aftertaste. It's not gritty like most gf breads are either. I probably wouldn't use this as a pizza crust but for a nice loaf of bread - I'll def make this again. It does have a hint of the french bread taste but it's not exact and don't expect it to be. Some people who try these mixes crack me up because they get all upset when it's not exactly like a gluten filled product. This is probably as close as you can get with a pre made mix and it's easy to make, too!"
5,The best GF bread I have had yet!,"Let's face it, most GF bread is disgusting! Who wants to eat something you have to nuke or toast to eat it and it still is awful? Not this bread. Very easy to make (although my rising time is a lot longer than 40 minutes). I cut the bread thin to make sandwiches. The only drawback is the bread is crumbly. The taste more than makes up for this."
5,Great Bread!,I have been eating gluten free for 5 years and this is the best bread I have found. It turns out great every time. I use a Kitchenaid mixer and a glass baking pan to make a large loaf. I slice it and freeze half. It tastes best toasted.
1,Not Recommended,I did not like this bread mix. The texture is grainy and almost greasy in your mouth even though there is very little oil in the recipe. I would not recommend it to anyone and I will not buy it again.
4,Not french bread - but super tasty,"I bought the mix in hopes that I could create a bread for myself to use at Easter dinner. It does not taste like french bread but it does taste better than any gluten free bread that I have bought. It can be sliced thick or thin and it makes great french toast, sandwiches, garlic bread...you get the picture. It was not hard to make, though I did let it rise for too long which meant that it came spilling out of my loaf pan. I did not have time to dig out my breadmaker, but if it has a gluten free setting, I will be ordering this fantastic stuff by the case!!"
5,Better be hungry for pizza!,"Be sure you're hungry for pizza. It will make a large cookie sheet sized crust or 2 round crusts. Directions are very vague. Just use your instincts and it works fine. Haven't tried it as French bread yet, but I'm guessing it will make several loaves. Tastes pretty much like the Glutino Favorite Sandwich Bread - like potato bread. Works well. Good price on Subscribe & Save."
3,boh,"i dont know what to say. i tried in 3 different ways, none each lead to perfect results.Flavour is ok, very good but doesn't grow and gets soft enough once cooked"
2,"Good biscuits, not french bread","I bought this case of Gluten-Free Pantry Country French Bread mix because I have not had french bread in a long, long time. I know french bread and this, ladies and gentlemen, is not french bread. If made per the instructions it is a lot more like a loaf of biscuit.The bad part is that it is nothing remotely like french bread. The good part is that if formed right, it makes pretty good biscuits. Really, they are pretty good biscuits. I make drop biscuits and put an egg ring around them to keep them from spreading too much. Then I bake them on a pan (I only make a quarter of the mix at a time...the biscuits do not store well once cooked) and presto, biscuits.Calling it french bread is like calling a cat a dog.Richard"
2,Not so great,I was so excited to get this mix. That being said this does NOT taste like any like french bread it might be alright as pizza crust.Pros:- baked up nicely- nice crust- nice looking loaf/slices- was palatable after a good dose of garlic butter and then toastedCons:- does NOT taste like French bread- funny aftertaste (when plain)- did not smell good baking up
2,More biscuit than French bread...,"I was so excited to see the crusty looking French bread on the front of the box - I bought it and went home to make it IMMEDIATELY! However, I was very disappointed because the texture is more like buscuits than the bread on the cover and it looks nothing like the cover in texture either...I will not be buying this again because I have a better biscuit recipe - no need to spend the money and not get the expected result!"
1,Weapon of mass destruction!,"This breadmix is a sorry excuse for BREAD.I followed the instructions, the dough did rise, and scent from the oven was quite good.However, the finished product can be lethal.It is a heavy, hard, rock like bread when finished, and the manufacturer should changed description to ""WARNING, WMD!""Stick to Bob's Redmill homemade wonderful bread mix. Now that's a real bread!"
3,"Fun, but didn't wow me","This first book in Tarr's 'The Hound and the Falcon' trilogy is a work of alternate history, taking place in England during the reign of Richard I. Alf, a monk at St. Ruan's Abbey, is an elfin changeling left there as a baby, and despite his fair looks and that he never seems to age, only a few are aware of or suspect his true nature. When an injured rider arrives at the abbey one evening, it becomes Alf's turn to play the part of messenger and ambassador to Richard I in order to prevent war among neighboring lands.Although I wasn't completely wowed, I like Judith Tarr and I'm looking forward to reading the next part in the series."
4,Wonderful bit of musical history,Nice song selections from one of the first radio stars of popular music. The quality of the sound on these ealy recordings is (generally) remarkable. A very enjoyable album.
4,One of Chicago's Best,"Out of the 13 Chicago albums I have, this one is the best. Terry Kath is smoking on his two numbers ""Missipppi Delta City Blues"" and ""Takin' It On Uptown"". Lamm's songs are typical filler songs from him, and are politically oriented. Peter Cetera only has one ballad, the pleasent ""Baby What A Big Surprise"". The gem of the album, as indicated by some of the other reviews, is Lee Loughnane's ""This Time"". Terry's time with Chicago ends with the epic Moody Bluesish ""Little One"". If James Pankow wrote a few more Chicago albums, this would have been perfect. If you are a new Chicago fan, I would certainly recommend buying it."
3,This is where the band starts to fall apart.,"Chicago is one of my all time favorite bands and this is in my opinion the album that shows they were going down hill. A lot of people say Chicago went down hill becasue of Terry's death, I disagree. There is even signs of weakness in Chicago X. Chicago ran their course."
4,A fine end of one era.,"This album represents the last Chicago album to feature Terry Kath's musicianship as well as James Guercio's production techniques. Chicago's music since this album, while not neccessarily less worthy, is clearly different in terms of the group's production style as well as their changing membership. All of the songs are gems. The album shows that Lamm's sense of humor remains intact on the cynical but upbeat""Vote for Me"". Terry Kath provides some tremendous performances on the rocking ""Taking It On Uptown"" and ""Mississippi Delta City Blues"". His soulful voice is prominent in the backing vocals on the reflective ""Take Me Back To Chicago"" as well as his lead vocal on ""Little One"". It is an album worth seeking out. P.S. Contrary to popular belief, this album was a commercial success. It rose to #6 on the Billboard chart where it quickly achieved a platinum certification. They all can't sell as much as ""17""."
3,Good Moments But Not Quite Over The Top,"This last recording to feature guitarist Terry Kath. Even with Terry's presence, this Chicago release is truly a mixed bag.I know every reviewer seems to like the opening Mississippi Delta Blues number. Whereas the guitar and horn stylings are quite appealing, the melody is quite unmemorable. The Second track Baby What A Big Surprise is more tuneful and features some pretty horn and string touches. However its oh too sappy for my tastes and was badly overplayhed on AM radio.Truthfully the best tunes on this collection are the soulful Take Me Back To Chicago, the passionate Little One, and Lee Loughnane's finely arranged This Time. The other non mentioned tunes are decent but certainly not spectacular. Unfortunately after this release, it would all go downhill."
2,Disappointing Treatment of Ancient Empires,"Secrets of Ancient Empires collection is a disappointing 5 DVD-set compared to say, Secrets of Archeology. Secrets of Archeology, a six-DVD set, introduces viewers to twenty-seven amazing archeological sites spread over Africa, the Americas, Asia, and Europe.Secrets of Ancient Empires tries to cover too much ground in a very short time. The running time of each DVD is just 50 minutes. The series successively covers the first civilizations, cities, merchants, armies, and beliefs. The computer-generated imagery used is repetitive and does not seem to be state-of-the-art. Some DVDs like The First Cities feature some lousy acting that makes watching it a chore.To summarize, this DVD-set can best be forgotten due to its superficial treatment of key subjects that should allow viewers to better understand what they owe to the ancient empires."
2,"Nice idea, but not at all durable","It would be just fine if not for the fact that the case tears easily. It is made of thin vinyl and cardboard. It wouldn't be a problem if not for the fact that the handle falls off easily, and it doesn't close tightly. Unfortunately, I haven't seen more than this one and the 48 box for the Hotwheels, which is much larger which makes it less portable. This one annoys the heck out of my wife and I, as the handle falls off while carrying it and the cars spill all over the place at inopportune times."
1,Not as pictured,"Item received was a Hot Wheels (wheel-shaped) case, not the Matchbox case pictured. Yes, the ""wheel"" case is shown if you go to the additional pictures, but the title and primary picture were Matchbox and that's what we thought we were buying. If the vendor had been clear about what they offered, we would have passed. Deceptive and disappointing."
3,Just ok,"The fit was alright. I am a very small evidently cuz the top is a bit big, I wear a 34 normally. The bottoms fit good. The quality left something to be desired but at least I didn't have to shop all over the place for a pair of stockings to match. Overall, cute and sassy."
3,"Very Good, but not as good as Last Jihad","This book starts out explosive, but seems to get somewhat intrenched in backstory and tends to go on with long periods of time between action sequences. An excellent library read, but maybe not a purchase for those saving money. Joel Rosenberg is an excellent writer, but this novel seems to leave you wanting more."
5,Are we in the last days?,"Of all the fiction novels that I have read, this is by far one my favorites!!! In fact, I would say it is either #1 or #2. And here's why: It hooks you from the very first sentence drawing you into a plot to assassinate a well known leader. The gripping action that follows has you on the edge of your seat (careful...don't blow out your aorta!) and forces you to turn off the also intense and thrilling 2003 World Series between the Yankees and the Marlins (go Marlins!). Just when you think and expect things to slow down, Rosenberg takes you further into a world and into the minds of those filled with darkness where evil prowls around like a roaring lion seeking to devour its prey. Similarly, you are taken into the minds of those who seek to make peace, who seek the good of all men. The struggle that follows is powerfully intense, timely, heart-pounding, and insightful!"
2,A Navy Sergeant?,"Not a review exactly as I have not read (and may not read)the book. I picked it up and while skimming through it happened to notice in the Cast of Characters section a ""Sergeant Hunt, Navy SEAL."" Now unless this obvious error is explained somewhere in the plot (in other words it's not an error) this makes me wonder what other obvious and easy to check errors the author has made in this book and others he's written. Just sayin'."
1,Sins of omission,"One of the most blatant omissions in TLD was any reference to the US nuclear strike. NOTHING AT ALL is mentioned...as if it didn't even happen. And the funny part is the suggestion that meetings/press conferences take place in Sadaam's palace. Now, first of all, the city was nuked. Secondly, concern for radioactive fallout isn't even mentioned (either regarding the targets of the nukes or the neighboring countries). Nothing along these lines is addressed. If this is a follow-up to ""The Last Jihad"", then please refer to the very last page of that book...TWO nuclear bombs are dropped by the US (TLD starts up two weeks later...the Prez is still in a wheelchair from the attack on him in Denver). If we mere citizens can ask these questions, why oh why can't Mr. Rosenberg who is a supposed expert? And why should the US come across as being blatantly cavalier about nuclear devestation?"
1,"I like his politics, but this is terrible fiction!","I have enjoyed Rosenberg's writing in World Magazine and elsewhere. He is an insightful writer of non-fiction. But this is really bad. There are serious errors and the plot is simply unbelievable. Joel, return to non-fiction and I'll read everything."
4,Fact/fiction... or both?,"So I continue my love of this series with this book. I only gave this one 4 stars because there were times where Joel would explain certain things in the story and it would REALLY slow down. I understand why but still... OK OK OK, I would give 4.5 stars because this was a non-stop (pretty much) thrill ride from start to ""finish"".Now about the fact/fiction debate. To me it's not a debate at all! There is evil in this world and it needs to be exterminated! Period! Joel paints an all too real story about the United States, her allies, and her enemies. Awesome read for anyone and just not for those of us who are on ""this side""."
4,Involvement at Every Level,"This book is amazingly on-track with current affairs and technology. It is action-packed in a Clancey-esque style. Laced throughout the storyline is a blooming romance for those who like the softer side. The development of a spiritual comprehension and conversion in a man who lived only for money is subtle and invites readers to think about such matters. The only detractor I found was the author's detailing of modern weaponry, military forces and strategies. When the action is going at a fast pace, I don't like to be slowed down to understand the technicalities that make this book so authentic."
2,Not what I expected,"The book was very slow, only really keeping my attention the last few chapters. The description sounded like it would be action packed, but just moved very slow. Should have put as much effort into the entire book as he did the final chapters."
1,BREATHTAKING in its stupidity,"If this is what the CIA, FBI and Secret Service are like, then heaven help us. Obvious things nearly knocked me over. When looking for Jon's mom (she decided to take a week off to be by herself), did they bother to check w/ the post office to see that she'd stopped her mail? Of course not. And would any agent (especially Erin, who is supposed to be top notch all the way) let Jon and the others (herself included) roam freely, shopping and dining and paying w/ credit cards on the very rock that hides the peace talks? No agent worth his/her credentials would allow such a breach. Such blatant stupdity is, indeed, breathtaking!"
2,Not for Me,"I was given this book as a bithday gift, and I may have to have a talk with my sister in law. The charactors are way too shallow for my tastes, and the plot, at least as much of it as I could stand to read, borders on being absurd. What annoyed me more, though, was that the book seems to be written with an eventual movie in mind. The perspective constantly shifts from person to person, and I could imagine the ease with which this tripe could be converted to a screen play. I do admit that I stopped reading the book about a third of the way into it, but that was all I could stand. I only read that far due to the book being a gift.Of course, it could just be me. I definately think this would be servicable as a movie. Maybe a late summer release with a 70 minute runtime."
1,bad condition,"This book was advertised as being in very good condition. The bottom of the book looked like a rat chewed on it and the cover was torn and missing a chunk. To me that is false advertsing, I was very disappointed in the condition when I received it."
3,in spite of the people quoted on the dust jacket recommending this,"joel's rather bizarre beliefs do not get in the way of the story, though he does falter when he quits the action and gets down to saving the world. otherwise it is an interesting story to read and a lesson on how far people will spin themselves when they really start to take their religion that seriously. what nearly turned me off at first were the people he has writing blurbs for the book; a drug addict now under felony indictment, two convicted felons, a reporter whose ideas are so skewed that real reporters make fun of him publicly and on air, and a rich guy who thought that just by having inherited all his father's money that he could be president, till he got laughed off the stage. this is not a crowd one would want to be seen with in public"
4,Interesting,"A sequel to The Last Jihad, this book lives up to the interest of it's predecessor in many respects but gets fairly tedious in laying out the Plan for Peace in the Middle East. Getting to the Peace talks alive and getting out of them alive are really what this book is about. And while the story is about that it bounces along in fine fashion as Jon Bennett, the President's ""point man"" for the Peace Process and Erin McCoy, his CIA protector and love interest endure more perils than Pauline ever imagined. Those that liked the first book will enjoy this one, for the most part."
3,The Last Daze,"Certainly an engaging read, filled with the right buzz words, and enough detail to convince the reader that Rosenberg knows his stuff. The story, nonetheless, requires just a bit too much of a leap away from reality to be credible, and the number of ""coincidences"" conveniently used to ""make things move along"" so that things could proceed really detracted from the quality of this book. Even the fundamental premise regarding the central character just doesn't cut it--one week, the guy is an investment banker, rolling in the dough, and the next week, he is negotiating peace in the middle east with a president and a prime minister, rolling in the dust and dodging bullets. Come on!! Get real. Not as good as The Last Jihad, and hopefully, not as good as Rosenberg's next hurrah."
3,So-So,"The writing fell into two categories: top-notch for disaster (explosions, use of technology) scenes, less-than-good for people he (tries to) portray(s) who become stiff, unbelievable actors. However, this series is fascinating because of the way Mr. Rosenberg perceives how the Second Coming of Jesus Christ MIGHT occur. His character Mordecai is the only character I wanted to read more about. Somehow the narrator caught the cadence of Mordecai's accent, and he was portrayed as a warm and wise patriarch. The citing and quoting of specific prophetic passages from the Bible were exact and precise."
5,Great Author!,"Love the books in this series (I think there's 5 of them). Good fun reads, action packed, with a small hint of a love story (nothing to make me gag as a guy :)"
5,A must read!,"Received this book in great condition and very timely. Have read the whole series by Joel Rosenberg and definitely recommend. Not only are great fiction novels that will hold you spell bound, but his research into the actual possibilities of coming true are phenomenal in his non-fiction, EpiCenter."
5,the last days book,wonderful book. It is like you are there with the characters. Face paced. hard to put down.
5,Book Review,"Outstanding book from series by Joel C. Rosenberg. While fiction, it includes many scripturally-based prophetic references that are revelationary. Would recommend book to anyone that is interested in the end-times."
5,it's coming true!,"Joel has an uncanny way of writing about things before they happen, by following Biblical prophecy... Reading this book will make you raise your eyebrows as we see what is transpiring in the world today - October 2012...."
5,The Last Days,"This is a must read! As usual, with Joel Rosenberg books, you can't put it down once you start reading."
2,Low Quality,Many of the pieces were only chocalate.Equally many of the pieces had lose or partially open wrappers.
1,mdp,I didn't even watch all of this movie because it was so bad. The one thing i did notice in the opening rescue scene was that most of the footage was from the 1990 Charlie Sheen movie Navy Seals which is a much better movie.
1,DESERT BLUNDER,Good thing I didn't pay for this DVD. This movie was a waste of my time. The Baldwin guy is given a job to stop a mad man from launching a missle. He puts together a crew to fly aircraft and prepair them for battle. This movie is low budgit and corny. When they fire at eachother you hear the gunshots but when they hit the person they die with no blood on them not even a bullet hole on their shirt.
1,I would like 87 minuets of my life back.,"This movie was the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. It had no plot and no story line. The actors were terrible and so were the special effects (all in consideration that the movie was made in 1998).If it is posible I would like to ask the director for the 87 minuets of the my life back, that I wasted watching that stupid movie. (I even hate the name ""Desert Thunder"")"
1,I would like 87 minuets of my life back.,"This was the worst movie I have ever seen. I am very suprised that it is still being manufactured, because it is the worst move ever. It had no plot, no story line, and the special effect were terrrible.If it is posible I would like to ask the director for the 87 minuets of my life, that I wasted watching that stupid movie."
5,Book: On Sarpy Creek,I thoroughly enjoyed this book and recommend it to anyone who is interested in the hardships and triumphs of a family living in rural Montana during the early 1900s.
2,since Ironias is downhill...,"He does one famous remake: Como quisiera Decirte that made Los Angeles Negros famous. My favorite remake though was Coccianti's Bella Sin Alma. Victor Manuelles's voice contains passion. But musically this cd is very bad compared to Ironias. He needs to get a good arranger. The arrangement on the songs are monotonous not only within the cd but within the salsa scene. Well,, time keeps on going he is getting older and his potential dimmer...."
4,Sensational Salsa,Victor is definately a sensational Salsa man. This CD is the latest of many hits. You will be able to play the entire CD without the thought of skipping a track.
5,This is an excellent album,"One of the best album for Jean Louis after TELEPHONE's adventure. Great sound and melodies, with some really originals lyrics. You need to understand french to appreciate some songs. Je recommande chaudement ce disque à tous ceux qui ont aimé TELEPHONE car on y retrouve beaucoup de l'ambiance de ce groupe. Beaucoup de chansons douces dans ce disque et quelques perles à écouter, vraiment."
3,"Nice, strong story, likable people","Back Cover description: Sister Tabitha was an efficient nurse, but when it came to matters of the heart she was less sure of herself. So when she fell in love, she had no idea how to deal with her feelings. Was that why the Dutch surgeon Marius van Beek called her Cinderella? If only Marius would ride up on a white horse and ask for her hand in marriage. But people lived happily ever after only in fairy tales, didn't they?Typical but nicely done. Strong heroine, likable hero. If you read Betty Neels, you have some idea of the way the characters react. This is a pleasant, warm-hearted story. Nothing new, but that's not why we read these."
2,using uncooked - doesn't remind me of pistachios,"I'm using this in vegan ice cream, uncooked. The flavor is exotic, but reminds me more of Pinesol than pistachios -lol."
5,all of twelve......... one of twelve,moment to momentpage to pageword to wordall togetherseperatedeeply rooted joy in the truth of it allsisters of nightmeet in the pagesreturning homepure
3,Low budget cheapie with genuine suspense.,"Shadowzone is a cheaply made sci-fi movie which, conveniently, isolates its B-movie cast (veterans Louise Flecther and James Hong, Shawn Weatherly from ""Baywatch"" and David Beecroft from ""Falcon Crest"")in an underground facility and predictably are trapped when they are menaced by an unseen force. The movie makes the best of these circumstances and actually builds tension that gets you into it. Cast is knocked off one-by-one, but it it extremely well made for its budget and squeezes its cast and effects for all their worth. If you like suspense, sci-fi, horror, thrillers or just the wierd, you'll enjoy this."
2,OLD SKOOL HORROR,NOT AS AS GOOD AS I THOUGHT YOU COULD NOT SEE NONE OF THE DEATHS WHICH WAS VERY ANNOYING TE ACTING WASIN'T BAD
5,"On The Dark Side Of Dreams, A New Terror Takes Shape!!!!!!!!","There's no escaping the Shadowzone. While there, even thoughts can betray you. That's a lesson learned too late by NASA hyper-sleep researchers. They've broken the boundaries of dream-sleep, unveiling a parallel dimension. And through that dimension comes an alien invader unlike anything you've seen before. It's fiendish. Pervasive. Cunning. And it takes the shape of each person's most morbid fear. David Beecroft (Falcon Crest) and Oscar-winner Louise Fletcher (One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest) confront an intruder of unrelenting ferocity in Shadowzone-a headlong plunge into a new dimension of unparalleled terror."
3,I love Gore,"Although this is NOT widescreen and only in stereo, this is the kind of movie for gore-lovers. Compare it with Xtro if you like, it's the same kind of movie. Of course there has to be a bad acting mad doctor who drives everyone nuts. The rest of the cast is not bad. Shadowzone is about breaking the boundaries of dream-state sleep and tapping into a parallell dimension. And when the mad doctor taps in, an alien appears. Of course the alien is not very friendly. For sound i rate this DVD 2 points, for picture, although NOT widescreen, i rate it 4 points. Not a lot of extras, but who would expect that anyway. So if you like horror, gore and B-movies, buy this one. For this price you should have an entertaining evening."
2,"good battery, useless solar functionality","I bought this to cover me during longer power outages (even short outages are thankfully very rare in my area, but it seemed wise to be prepared). It works fine as a battery -- plugged into the wall or into the car -- but the solar panel is so useless that even in a fully sunlit window it effectively does nothing. Buy a non-solar battery and get the same thing without the useless addition...or move outdoors and close to the equator so that the panel might actually charge the battery."
1,You'd have to pay me to keep it!,"This product looked really new and innovative, so I decided to purchase it. However, this product does not charge laptops well or other pratical items. I returned this pieace of junk and received a full refund.Save your money and the hassle at the post office!"
1,Highly Rated,"I wish I could rate this at less than one star. It represents a terrible waste of money. When I moved out of state, I left it uncharged for about 4 months. It no longer takes a charge by any means and no longer works in any way, shape of form. The solar panel can be disconnected so I may be able to salvage it for use with another device."
1,Came with the damaged battery not charging met my expectations not even reach 10%,"Bad battery not charging met my expectations not even reach 10%,was a purchase for garbage ,I am disappointed in this article"
2,Batteries failed at time of need,"Not the best for emergencies. Expensive item for what it does. Fancy cell phone charger. It failed when we needed it for a power outage. Doesn't work, not worth fixing."
2,Are we all returning the same unit?,"I ordered a new unit and received a used one (retailer: Summertime26) and it was pretty much a piece of junk. Wanted to check it out before returning and found it would only charge to 60 percent and then during use would immediately drop to 40 percent charge. I didn't bother with the solar panels.I wonder if those of us who are experiencing the same issue I mentioned have all had the same exact unit...I'd really like one of these for emergencies, on the condition that it works well, of course."
3,don't break the plug-in charger,"I'm using this to power a 12v fan to make my place liveable at night (no AC there, and I do live in Tennessee)The booklet said that it would take days under good conditions to recharge using the solar panel. No thank you.Fully charged, I can get 8 hours or so with the fan on low. Which was fine. Two days worth of fan. Until the grid-connected charger broke.But it's got a less standard plug-in. An aftermarket 12v charger, using the correct plug WILL NOT charge it up over 40 per cent after 24 hours. And, as other people have mentioned, that drops (to LOW in this case) the second you start using it--or turn it to AC.I suspect that the problem is that the 12v chargers are really twelve volts. Not the 13 or so that probably works better for these biggish batteries.Lots of solutions. But this was so easy."
2,Batteries dont fully charge.,"I got this unit and only 1 out of two fully charges. they hold their charge for a long time so its not really a problem. I actually ran a 110 volt light all night and not until the am did the battery finally quit. So, I keeping them for Power outages. For that they are fine."
3,Awesome for my setup but likely not your NEEDS...,"This is a awesome idea in my opinion but the cart got a head of the horse.. There is something I'm seeing with these reviews and my own in regards to it saying 100% charged, then immediately dropping to 60% or so when you turn it on. I have solar panels at home that charge deep cell batteries which I use to charge battery banks, phones, my laptop, etc, and this is good to do for building off of that.JUST DON'T EXPECT TO SIT THIS OUT FOR A DAY AND HAVE IT CHARGE ANYWHERE CLOSE TO 50% AND IT LOOSES CHARGE IF NOT USED RIGHT AWAY....HOWEVER, a plus to this is that you can charge it via 12 volt plug like in your CAR (cigarette lighter) which is great for the business man/woman on the move a lot.."
1,"Cool concept, but the company's claims fall way short","Quite simply, this thing looks great and the concept is wonderful. However, take all the best case scenarios and cut them in half on average. The company should be ashamed for publishing numbers that are not in the same ball park as the real numbers on my machine. I will say, it does make a great paper weight on a windy day and next time I'll just by an extra laptop battery (much smaller & cheaper & lasts longer)."
3,power regulator(110V-240V),Xantrex Xpower Powerpack Solar #852-2071In my review on this product if possible you can make power regulator that takes 110V/AC-240V/AC for international use.
1,save your money,Look if you want to learn to use solar energy don't buy this product. Get a book and use that for starts. This products solar panel is only a 5 wat panel so you get nothing from the sun practically and you will always have to charge from the wall. This product sucks trust me and don't buy it.
4,"good, not as good as the original","I purchased the original version at the Museum of Modern Art in NY about 20 years ago and believe it really does deserve recognition as an exemplar of excellent design. I wanted to get a back up even though the original one is still pulling out corks as well as ever.The current model differs in that the handle attaches at one end inside of in the middle. One might think that this would provide better torque, but added torque isn't needed because of the success of the overall design. Instead the offset handle creates more instability while turning it. On the other hand, the new version encloses the sharp point of the corkscrew better, which might be a benefit if one anticipates carrying it in a pocket."
1,Not what it's supposed to be!!!,"This is supposed to be a corkscrew made by Screwpull. It says so in the heading: ""by Screwpull"".I purchased this as a wedding gift for $27.99 instead of the lower-priced Le Creuset-branded corkscrews because my 15 year-old Screwpull is still functioning perfectly and I wanted to give the bride and groom a corkscrew that would last.The package just arrived and, instead of saying SCREWPULL, as is shown in the item description, it is branded LE CREUSET.It is decidedly shoddier in construction and has an AWFUL, serrated foil-cutting knife that doesn't even open fully as the one on the Screwpull does.To make matters worse, in the week that has elapsed since I ordered it, the price has dropped five dollars. NOT RECOMMENDED!!!I'm sending it back."
2,"Nice while it lasted, which wasn't very long","I liked this corkscrew, though the ritual of using it is prolonged: take it apart and put it together to use, then take it apart and put it together to store.One of the plastic arms that hold the screw in place broke after about six months of use. I might have been able to get more mileage out of the thing by applying some superglue, but my wife quickly bought an old-fashioned metal corkscrew that folds up like a pocketknife -- the kind we've seen many waiters use.Feels solid, and it's easier to use. We'll stick with that."
2,Screwpull Wine Cork Opener,"My wife and I are regular shoppers at Amazon...so, when we ordered two of the Screwpull pocket openers we were most confindent we were to receive reliable product. It didn't happen this time. We took the first Screwpull out of the package and began uncorking a bottle of wine. We got the cork about half way out of the bottle and then the Srewpull turn handle suddenly snapped off and desentigrated into pieces. I am hoping that Amazon will read this review and either send us a replacement or refund our money for this item. Meanwhile...we are using the second one we ordered and hope, each time we use it, it doesn't break like the first one. We've always trusted Amazon...We are sure Amazon will correct this.Lare and Karen Austin"
3,Corkscrew,"This is not the answer. It pulls the cork just fine, but the sloppy fit of the handle lets it fall off while turning. I glued the handle on but this makes it less portable and looks bad. A snug fit would have made this unit a success."
5,Best corkscrew I've ever owned - this is my second in 20 years!,"Reliable, easy to use, and sturdy. And luckily, goof-proof for a klutz like me! So easy to open corked bottles with this contraption -- and unlike the Rabbit at five times the price, few moving parts that might break or malfunction.I've owned at one for decades and it finally gave up the ghost. I ordered two this time!"
2,Simple elegant efficient,"At first sight, I thought I overpaid for a flimsy plastic corkscrew. But because of its surprising durability and design, I'm now confident of a good purchase.Insert the metal tip into the cork, and simply turn the handle. No pulling, no spilling, just keep turning and the cork automatically pulls up out of the bottle as you continue to turn. Okay, so I miss the little 'pop' at the end, but you can improvise!Let's update and knock this rating down...I don't use corkscrews much, but after perhaps 10-15 uses over a couple years, it broke. Yes, guess it was flimsy after all."
5,I love this beast!,I opened the package without looking at the instructions. I had no idea what to do at first. This is different from the standard corkscrew I'm used to but I'm a manly man and I don't need no stinking instructions ( I said to myself in a growling Spanish accent). Instinctively I knew what to do. Nothing would stop me. I wanted that bottle of 2005 Kendall Jackson Grand Reserve Pinot Noir and this baby wanted to open it.It guided my hands in a way that was strange but felt so natural. The bottle was opened in seconds. The wine was mine for the taking ... and I took it. Now I find myself trying to write this review.This honestly was the easiest cork puller I've ever used. It looks weird but it really works. I feel it should last. Certainly longer than this case of Pinot Noir. The Screwpull has a 5 year guarantee. Thank you Mr. Jackson and thank you Screwpull. Now back to my case of Pinot Noir.
5,This is a MUST HAVE!,"I am pretty new to wine drinking but I can tell you I hated fighting with the cork and the corkscrew. So I bought this and it is so easy to use, its an amazing contraption. Might seem a little complicated at first, but it really isn't and I am so glad I purchased it. Definitely worth it if you don't like fighting with your wine bottles."
5,Best wine opener,Used this wine opener at friend's home while in Arizona...couldn't wait to order some for me and friends...THE BEST DARN WINE OPENER ON THE MARKET!!!
4,Good Corkscrew,"This corkscrew was purchased to replace an identical unit that broke after a couple of years of fairly heavy service. The original worked well enuf that I was happy to replace it with what seems an identical unit.As long as you have one finger that can be held rigidly, you can remove a cork from the bottle and removing the cork from the corkscrew is a matter of putting a modest squeeze on the body and reversing the direction of the turning of the handle. I have some pain in my hands and this is the easiest to use of those I've tried."
5,I love this corkscrew.,Super easy to use and light and small for picnics. Had my last one for 6 years before it cracked. Buying another.
2,Get the Table Model Screwpull by Le Creuset instead,"Really, the Table Model Screwpull by Le Creuset is just as portable, and it's the best corkscrew I've ever used. I'd prefer a cheap ""wing"" type or waiter corkscrew to the Pocket Model. The Pocket Model is very awkward in the hand turning the screw, while the Table Model is a delight to use."
5,Best EVER!,"This is the absolute best wine opener I have ever owned. I can no longer find them in stores anymore, so I had to search on line. My product arrived quite quickly. I bought an extra one in case I wanted to give one away."
4,Works every time.,"Works really well. Easy to use, Stores nicely. And priced right. If you open a lot of bottles you might want one of their larger models. But if you open a bottle once in a while for special occasions, this is the way to go. You'll throw it in your gadget drawer and won't ever break or push a cork into a bottle again."
5,Corkscrew,This is a great corkscrew and very easy to use. It is very compact and we carry one in our luggage.
5,Screwpull cork screw,"I had difficulty finding this item and that is why I ordered two. The screw pull is easy to use, easy to store and I carry it on all my trips. The folding feature is just great for lite packing, fits everywhere and works every where. One problem is that you have to keep an eye on this one, a lot of people like to borrow and forget to return.Best and easiest to use"
3,"Dated, awful string orchestra","I could probably stop with the title, since you probably know what I mean. If you like having Spector's ""Wall of Sound"" touch applied to every last bit of music you own, you'll probably appreciate the ""other half"" of this disc. Not me. A little over half the tracks are straight-up pre-war and Chicago blues classics that get just the guitar/voice/and minimal percussion touch, and those are really well done. Nothing special, but they're tuneful, tasteful, and solid. Hence the 3 stars. But the rest have some truly cheesetastic string orchestral sounds behind them. About as ""Mississippi Delta Blues"" as Seals & Crofts. No thanks."
3,Spyder Bottom Line Screw and Washer,"The screw diameter and thread size were correct, but it was too long. I cut it and fixed the threads and then it worked perfectly. The screw is still in the paintball gun after all these months and I have not had any issues."
4,William Blake voyages throug time,"Seer, mystic, prophet, artist, genius-he was visionary poet William Blake. And Kate, a grocer's daughter, adored him. She loved Blake enough to become his wife. She loved Blake enough to follow him into poverty, into madness, into hell . . .And then into Time.Because all of William Blake's angels and monsters, from dread Urizen to the immortal Zoas, were real. Beings of unimaginable power, power that they offered to Britain's finest minds . . . and as a joke, to poor dowdy Kate.But when the power grows evil, when horror engulfs the world and deadly terrors clasp the man she loves, then poor dowdy Mrs. Blake challenges the gods to rage through time-a tyger burning bright, in the forests of the night!A thrilling science fiction novel from the author of The Ecolog and Then Beggars Could Ride."
1,Does not work in seated position,I purchased this item because it is advertised as working in a seated position. It does not. It slipped off my head when the weight of the water bag was applied no matter how tight I had it. There were no instructions with the halter.
3,Good to Start,"This book is a good primer for those just getting started in fleshing out your family tree, but for most advanced genealogists this book is full of information that you knew already. If you have a friend just getting started in their quest, by all means buy then this book."
3,More of the same,For subscribers of the previous mastering Delphi series this book is not going to add much to your knowledge of Delphi.I have the Mastering Delphi 4-2005 and I haven't really opened this one as it offers nothing new.For the beginner in Delphi this would prove as useful as Mastering Delphi 4 was for me; invaluable.
3,Insufficient coverage of .NET,"I am pretty disappointed by this book as I bought Mastering Delphi 7 by Marco. The .NET topics are hardly covered. Furthermore, the ECO chapter is only introductory. More would have been good. I also do not see much ""new"" with the book for the topics that have changed from Delphi 7 to Delphi 2005. A lot of chapters have been revised, but it still does not seem as ""round"" as the book for Delphi 7.Marco offers new chapters that deal with changes from Delphi 2005 to Delphi 2006 on his webpage, which is quite nice. However, I doubt I'll buy any other book in this series as the number of changes made do not justify the price.If you have Mastering Delphi 7, I'd stay with that and use blogs and other online sources for the changes and buy a book that focuses on .NET instead (Xavier Pacheco e.g.)."
5,Bought 2 more,I have had a pair of these for about 5 years now and I love them. I have a handful of other diagonal cutters but when I can't find this one it drives me crazy. Today the spring broke so I was forced to buy another pair. I love them so much I bought two of them. For small jobs you can't go wrong.
5,Wire Cutter / Diagonal Cutter Small,"IRWIN 4-1/2-Inch Flush Diagonal w/Spring 2078925- Great small compact cutters, great for close quarter cutting zip ties, zip ties and more zip ties, cuts right through the bulky head of a zip tie with ease and small gauge stranded and solid soft core wire."
2,Too soft for watch stem cutting,"I really hoped these pliers could handle cutting down the stem of the ETA/Unitas 6497-1. Unfortunately, it seems the stem is too thick and too strong for this little tool. Each time I made a cut it dented the blade.Stem cutting is a slow process of trim-fit-repeat until the crown is flush with the case. now this tool has a serrated edge. According to Otto Frei website, The Lindstrom brand is highly regarded amongst professional watchmakers. But those retail at around $40! I'm wondering if Klein tools is good, also. I guess I'm going to have to get one of those the next time I put together another watch in a few years."
5,A Real Man's Tool,"They really work great for clipping a real man's fingernails.The clippings fly farther than any clippers I've ever used.Oh, yeah, they are well built."
2,Worked well for about 10 cuts,I returned the pliers to amazon as they stopped cutting after about 10 cuts.As a mechanic I know you need to have the right tool for the job. I got the Irwin pliers to cut .020 stainless steel annealed wire which does not damage the blades on any of the small pliers that I have.After ten cuts I had to hold the Irwin pliers closed and bend the wire before it will cut. I was thrilled with them until they stopped working. They are made in China.I now useXuron 2175 Maxi Shear Flush Cutteras Xuron makes quality tools that last and work the same from the first cut on. I use the Xuron regularly and they still work just as good as the first cut. Xuron is made in the US and has a lifetime warranty.
5,Love this cutter!,"I bought this cutter because the reviews I read all said it was tough and it cuts relatively flush to the surface, and the reviews were correct! I use this ALL the time in my craftwork. I use it to cut the backs off of buttons (glass, plastic, shell, and metal), and it does a fabulous job. I will be watching this item for future sales because I would like to have another one for backup (I'm hard on my tools)."
5,Wonderful Story to Share,This book is one of my favorite holiday stories! I am a first grade teacher and have shared this story with my students for the past several years and will continue to share it for years to come. You will not be disappointed with your purchase!
3,lula's ebay,this is the best thing i have ever heard of and i will tell all of my friends about it. i wish i could keep it but it is on my neighbors computer and i do not hasve the money for it right now. but i wish there would be a miracle and i would one day find at my house already paid for or an angel came down to me to guide me3.
4,great family fun,Loads of family fun. Once you get hooked on playing you have to make yourself stop.
4,I love this game,"I was at a friends house and we wanted to play a boardgame. We were actually looking for Risk (another great game by the way), when we stumbled upon this game unopened in his closet. Apparently he'd gotten it as a present and never tried it. So we decided to try it as a joke, as we had done before with Harry Potter's Quidditch board game, which was terrible. After a few trial rounds we realized...hey! This game is really fun!Now I'm addicted. Sure it's not really that much like eBay bidding. Sure some of it is chance. But it's such a great game of reflexes and good bidding skills. If you need a good 3-4 player game, this is definately worth your money."
2,press resume to do what?,Although I'm sure some people in this world enjoy trying to figure out how to play a game I am not one of them. The instructions are poorly written and quite honestly I put the game back in the box and played uno. It's not a game you can play with two people and by the time you've taught everyone to play half the party has lost interest and/or fell asleep. Not a good no brainer fundamnamentals game! stick with rumicube.
3,Item is NOT what is pictured,"The detail on the product image is amazing. The product image clearly shows leg muscles, the long ""bump"" on the back of his head, definition in the arms, and I can go on. It looks identical to the one I saw in my friends home.The Product Features state ""details will vary slightly"" which is understandable since this is a hand carving.I have been anticipating this purchase for quite some time. When I opened the box, wow, was I extremely disappointed. What I received looks nothing like the Product Image. There is little to no detail like the image.Now I am curious, where did you get the product image from? That is the Weeping Buddha I want!"
4,Too Easy Applications,"This book comes with dozens of useful, not trivial applications for ASP.NET web applications. I enjoyed the book and each example made me sit down and learn more about ASP.NET. The entire book is well organized and keeps you hungry for the next example. The source practically ran right off the CD. I did have a little trouble with one or two examples, but there were dozens that required me to simply create the database table. I definately recommend this book to ASP.NET Developers."
3,VB Only?,"I just wish I would have know that all of the examples use VB.NET to power the applications. It doesn't really matter if you already know VB, or if you want to. But if you are more familiar with C# make sure and buy a book that specifies the language."
4,Cute addition to the bedroom,This is a cute phone and it looks like a landline but is a portable. I bought two of these phones. I like it so much better than the phones that offer one or two extensions because the range is so much better with its own base. AND it is so much more affordable than the Panasonic and works much better too. The price is about 50 cents cheaper than Target and there's no tax and no shipping charges if you have Amazon Prime.
3,Cute but the display LCD does not last long.,"It is definitely a cute and unique looking phone that adds an accent to your home, but the LCD display faded in an year or so. I wish there were more variety in ring tones."
3,Good if you just want to read the stories.,I have to echo the other comments that reviewers have made on this book. The stories are great and brought back a lot of childhood memories.The reproduction of the colors leave a lot to be desired. Most of the shades were way too dark and that made it difficult to enjoy the art/pencils. Wish the publisher spent a little more time with this.
4,Last of the great Procol records,"Starting off with ""Is it on Tommy?"" Nothing but the Truth! The cover is beautiful and some nice tunes here with only a couple of duds, which is very good. The best w/o Robin Trower lead guitarist extraordinaire!"
2,Fresh fruit?,"I was concerned upon ordering this that the great reviews here only represented the views of diehard Procol fans. After listening to this album, I'm afraid I was right. Actually I liked the b-side ""Drunk Again"" the best. More than a few songs are unspeakably bad. ""Fresh Fruit"" is neither sweet nor fresh.Quite a disappointment for ""A Salty Dog"" fan. Not sure whether to take a chance on ""Grand Hotel.""I own the Friday Music remaster (not Salvo)"
3,not that bad,"The absence of Terry Kath(Chicago's lead guitarist) and Guercio (their producer) definitely had a noticable effect on the quality of the music on this album. Some of the material is good, and some isn't. I think the band did the best they could given their situation, and I'm glad they didn't quit."
4,carving abuse,This item took the abuse of being used on 13 watermellons and 10 pumpkins in two days. This product held up to the demands of my industrial kitchen
3,Superficial but enjoyable,Swinging bachelor Johnny Gains (Bixby) one day learns that he fathered a boy 17 years ago when the bright eyed lad shows up at his doorstep. The mother has passed on and Johnny has some tough decisions to make and learns in the process that he has some growing up to do himself.Lighthearted TV movie of the week goes by all too fast (clocking in at 73 minutes) and only superficially touches on an important subject. Bill Bixby is very likable (as always) and despite all the short cuts the film is quite enjoyable. Just don't expect too much.One thing though. The DVD is not very good with heavy grain throughout and not even chapter stops. It's acceptable...just.
4,"""I am a man!""","I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I tuned in to watch this, but I knew that Bill Bixby would not disappoint. He played the part of the charming, immature swinger very well. He's such a fantastic actor and one of my favorites. I really appreciated the focus on the lifestyle differences between the father and son. BJ was raised a mild, small town boy, he goes to church, he doesn't drink or engage in casual affairs with women. In many instances B.J behaved more like a mature man than his father. It's a lesson that John painfully learns by the end when things start somewhat caving in on him. I liked John's parents, aside from being comic relief, their treatment of John shows us why he is so laid back about life and responsibilities. Sure it was frothy at times, perhaps it glossed over issues, but it was still just a TV movie of the week. I enjoyed this very much."
1,Not Courtship of Eddie's Father - disappointed,This movie has the same actors/actresses in it as the weekly show so I took a chance thinking it may be about the same - not at all like the sequel. So I was disappointed.
3,as expected,The price was reasonable and shipping was quick. I was very happy the product was as descripted new. My son will get a great deal of use at his wrestling matches.
2,didn't work for me,"It looked like it would do what I wanted to but even with adjusting it, it still didn't fit right and with the cost for shipping it back, it didn't pay to"
5,confidence,Bought this for a 4th grade player on our basketball team who has constent nose bleds. With this shield he has the confidence and no fear of getting hit.
3,not practical,Protects your nose but you cannot realistically play a sport. It blocks vision at angles such as seeing down while playing basketball.
1,too narrow,I read the reviews and decided to try it anyways and all of the reviews that said it was narrow were right on. I could not wear it without quite a bit of discomfort.
4,"Worked ok for soccer, as long as you modify it","My daughter broke her nose playing soccer, and needed this protective device in order to continue playing. The biggest issue to overcome for soccer is the interferance with periferal vision. Depending on what injury you are protecting, you can increase the vision range by easily grinding out some of clear plastic (and even the black padding) using a Dremel tool or similar rotary tool. Use your head; if you are protecting an injured cheek, don't grind out the cheek area."
2,Basketball use of nose guard,"My 7th grade son used the Bangers nose guard face shield to protect his broken nose when at basketball practice.He said it was not very comfortable and it bothered him because he couldn't see as well with peripheral vision.He only had to wear it for one week though and wouldn't have been able to participate in his basketball practicewithout it, so he was glad to have it."
1,One size does NOT fit all,"This product does not protect a broken or bruised nose. As a matter of fact there is more chance of further damage if the guard is warm and is not a perfect fit (which for most people, will not be)."
3,Solid protection,"This product protects the nose very well, but the reason I gave it 3 stars is because it's difficult to see the soccer ball at your feet. It might work well for other sports, but not for soccer."
3,Blocked vision,My 17 yo daughter broke her nose playing soccer and needed to wear a mask for 6 weeks. She's a goalie and she found that the mask blocked her vision. We had to remove a lot of the black padding under her eyes so she could see the ground. She also complained that wearing the mask made her head hurt.
5,Perfect for cheer!,My daughter broke her nose and needed protection for all-star cheerleading. This fit the bill and wasn't too clumsy to wear.
2,Meh....,"This book contains most of the important musical elements of ""Hair"". Most. As is typical of many second-rate Vocal Selections books, many of the songs are re-arranged, truncated, and, generally, bastardized. It was published as a tie-in for the film version of ""Hair"", and this book does for the music what the movie did for the stage show: no favors. A must-miss for any serious ""Hair"" aficionado. Two stars because it is, after all, still ""Hair""...."
5,TWO GLOCKS UP!!,"This has got to be the best in the HOOD documentaries every made. Everything you see on this DVD is REAL and RAW and IN YOUR FACE! You see everything from drugs..to guns...to REAL THUGS in some of the roughest hoods in America.I can't even describe one scene that stood out because the ENTIRE DVD is RAW and GRITTY!Pick this up and see this because it's educational, in a way...TWO GLOCKS UP!"
1,Boring,"Very disappointed. Just ""dudes"" talkin' talkin' talkin' about nothing really -- no action; no inside look at anything ""illegal"" going on or what gangsters really do. I'm selling mine."
1,BORING,i am dumber for watching this.just a van going from town to town. with kids talking about how 'bad' their neighbourhood is!! nothing happens. just dumb people talking some sort of english that is barely understandable....1 star...
3,2 glocks down from a 5,this dvd wasnt all that great. and that racist comment game made about latinos. that got me madhe sumething about latinos that are so condindent. that aint true.the y say tat wat ever type of spanish b*tch you are. yourare a snitch. and that was very racis.
1,disappointed,I was disappointed that it was a library book. I didn't know that and cannot now give it as a gift.
4,It works!,"Quick and easy replacement, this is the same brand and model number you would get at any auto store but for about 50 bucks less. Quality seems good and no more leaks from our 2005 town and country minivan. Had it in for a month now, no issues"
3,"New Kimba, not Original Kimba.","Kimba exists in two versions. The original version, which older fans remember, is now out in a big box set. This DVD contains the 1993 version, which has a new soundtrack with new voices and music. This 1993 version is currently being shown on some TV stations, so if you have watched Kimba on TV recently, this is probably the version you want.There are three episodes on this particular DVD: ""Rumble in the Jungle"" (original title ""Battle at Dead River""), ""A Flood of Grasshoppers"" (original title ""Insect Invasion""), and ""Egg Hunt"" (original title ""Scrambled Eggs""). These same episodes are available on other DVDs made by Genius Products, but they were transferred properly on this Bazooka Joe DVD, and look pretty good (the other Genius DVDs of Kimba look very bad).The packaging is strange: it has a lot about Bazooka bubblegum, but not much about the Kimba shows--not even the titles. The extras on this DVD are trivia about Bazooka bubblegum as well."
5,Not sure which order I did....,"This is a great sealer but I thought sure I ordered the breadboard making pen, I needed them both and it does a great job so if you repair or make your own boards and need to seal them for protection you can't go wrong with this sealer."
1,This book is in the wrong catagory,"This book is fiction, through and through.Anyone who has studied this case will realize that themystery is not if Bruno H. was involved, but did he workalone? Did his wife help him?"
1,Get The Facts,"Jim Fischer'sLindbergh Caseis a comprehensive, well documented exploration of the Lindbergh baby kidnapping. If you want to know the whos, hows and whys of this case do yourself a favor and read that instead. The facts speak for themselves - and they don't agree with Kennedy."
1,Fantasy,Those who have read this book and felt terribly sorry for Hauptmann should now read Jim Fisher's The Lindbergh Trial to see what really happened. There was no miscarriage of justice and Hauptmann deserved his fate. Kennedy's book is a mishmash of sentimental reasoning and special pleading. Just one example: he pretends that there was extreme prejudice against Hauptmann because he was German. The fault with this theory is that in 1933 there was no widespread hostility to Germany and Mrs Hauptmann herself denied that she encountered any such problems. Fisher points out dozens of similar examples of faulty reasoning from Kennedy.
3,"Nice photos, but light on biographical or climbing information.","I first became aware of Ron Kauk through the article that Sports Illustrated published about him back around 1986, which I partly credit for sparking my own interest in rock climbing. I recently bought this book online, hoping to read more anecdotes and climbing tales of the sort I'd read in Sports Illustrated years ago (and like those contained in works by Roper, Long, Ament, Krakauer, et al). However, the text of the book consists mainly of philosophical fluff, tinged with native American attitudes toward nature, that has about as much substance as cotton candy. Not to belittle Kauk's viewpoint--I'm sure he's sincere, and in certain ways I envy him his lifestyle (not to mention his climbing ability)--but I was expecting literary meat and potatoes and was left salivating."
5,It's a battery. It works,Just going by their website I hoped it would be the right thing.I have a Honda 65kw generator. This battery fit. It worked. It starts the thing. What else do you want?Check me next winter. Will I be pissed that it died after a year? Yes. So I hope not to be pissed.Zen.
4,This value guide has real value,"I have been interested for a long time in the history of golf clubs, but there are few good books on this subject. Pete Georgiady seems to be the only real expert out there who has put it in writing. In addition to lots of good information about many club makers, he supplies almost 300 pictures to help identify old clubs. A great aid to any serious golf club collector!"
3,Its cute,Its cute but the opening is very small and its always hard to get any of my ferrets in it. I only have one ferret who doesn't mind being in it after a bath. My 3 other ferrets hate being put in this and try to escape from it. Half of the time they actually do escape. One of my ferrets hated being in this thing so much he poo'd in it as soon as I put him in it. A few times my ferrets have gotten a claw stuck in the mesh also. I quit using these and now use a thick towel instead. My ferrets like using a towel better then this and I think the drying sack just stresses them out.
1,Picture does not match the product,"I had the white drying sack for years. I wanted another one. When i ordered this one, I received a blue/duck drying sack. the whole is not big enough to get a wiggling ferret into it. I do not like the duck design either. Wondering if they still make the white drying sack, if not wish they would make it again."
3,Not worth it,"We bought this to help dry our 2 ferrets, it is very small, our older ferret doesnt fit in it. Its very cute and the little ferret likes it but it doesnt last very long."
3,Delta El Greco Ceiling Hoist,"Fair for the investment.Installs easily. Ropes will fray immediately, so how long they last will depend on have often you use. Makes storage better and lifting the bikes is no longer a chore."
4,Happy with hoist.,"I purchased bike hoists to lift my bikes up 14ft to the recessed area in front of my a/c unit. Everything worked perfectly; from the latch system to the bikes lifting evenly on both ends. The only frustrating part of mounting the hardware, was the fact that I did not realize that the hardware is hollowed out on the backside of the pulleys and I was mounting both hardware pieces to same beam. So, instead of using a sold piece of wood between the two hardware pieces and be exposed. I had to cut two pieces of wood to fit under the hardware only and mount them to the ceiling first then mount the pulleys to the ceiling. Everything works great and the bikes are holding strong 1 month later."
4,Delta Ceiling Hoist a good product,Received the 3 sets on time and in good shape. Installed with out any problem for three bycicles. I used the ropes. For now they are fine. I rope is avarage. But system is OK with good price.
4,Great Ceiling Bike Lift,I used a board between the joists to mount the rack. Then screwed the rack into the board. The rack works great but I agree with 3 privious reviews that the screws are that great. I used deck screws instead. Easy to put up and works great. Because I've only had it up for 2 weeks now I don't know how durable the cord will be. Easy to operate and I'm ordering a second one.Terry in OregonRacor PBH-1R Ceiling-Mounted Bike Lift
4,Works As Advertised,"Product worked well and was easy to install, once you locate the joices / studs. Screws aren't up to par with the rest of the product just as other reviewers said. Drilling pilot holes helped."
4,Getting Organized,This product mounted great. I had to use my own screws. The screws that came with the purchased product were cheap and the heads stripped easily. Other than that I am pleased.
3,bike hoist,"love the product. Its inexpensive and does the job, I bought four of them. The only negative thing is the rope started to fray after the first few times of use. Needs a better rope."
4,Rocketbox finally out of the way,"it took a little while to get the hoist installed but that was because I hate being up on ladders so its not the fault of the product. Love having the huge rocketbox finally up and out of the way. It was tricky to hoist the box as one end would go up and the other wouldn't, had to do it in small bits, raising it by the rope then leveling the box then hoisting again, repeating this until it was up. Did have a bit of screw stripping issues but was able to work through it..."
4,meets the need,I bought two of these to mount both my son's bike and mine in the garage. They are easy to use and seem very secure. I would recommend this for both adult and children's bikes. The only complaint I have is that the cord is extremely long and puddles on the floor.
5,Bless Me Indeed!,"I absolutely love this book and highly recommend it. I'm teaching 2-5 yrs old during the summer in Sunday School and when I found this book, I knew this was it! I am actually ordering one for each member of my class because this is a prayer they can use their entire life. The person that gave this book a bad review needs to read the original Prayer of Jabez. There are blessings for us, if we just ask and I don't want to miss out on one! It explains it in terms that little ones can understand."

5,Motown Does It Again!!!,Another antholgy album!! The music is fresh as usual(but come on) how many more albums or collections do we need Baby Love on!! I love the Supremes but dislike what Motown is doing to them. Give us the original albums on CD. Release one or two a year bring the Supremes back to the top!!
4,something missing?,"Geeze, this thing has 'em all, you might think...problem is, without ""Love Is Like An Itching In My Heart"" why bother! Wouldn't it be *brilliant* of the folks @ Motown (there is still a Motown, isn't there?) to remaster and reissue all the LPs from the ""golden age"", 1964-70? Seems like good business..."
5,CLassic Material,Talk About Music that Captures a TIme Period? Great Supremes Material&Great Solo Diana Ross Material.Timeless Quality Material.When Words&Music Mattered.
4,okay,"Thought the story jumped around alot. Was suprised when they took care of the spider lady so early on. I was wondering what they were going to face for the next 350 pages. Still a good book with alot of action. I had to read the sea dragon/mermaid part twice to truly understand what was going on and how he came to life. Pretty cool regardless. Really interested about the romance. When or if anything is going to happen. So is Clemens going to put the readers out of their misery?! Hopefully in book three, which is what I'm about to start on now."
5,Even better than before...,"I waited impatiently for the arrival of this book and will have to do so again for the next volume. Clemens adds depth to his original work and surpasses his own standard. There are treasures to be found within his writing technique and style. The imagery is rich.The plot-twists are intriguing.The details are precise, concrete, and thourough. He ends up anticipating the reader's own imagination. James Clemens: You should be so ****PROUD*** of your achievement!"
5,Darker and Nastier than the first! In other words I love it!,"Usually the second novel in a fantasy series is the weakest.This rule is broken in this sequel to witchstorm as Clemens returns us to his world of awesome good and terrifying evil!Our heroine come one step closer to fulfilling her destiny and dark forces against her are more determine than ever to defeat her.The author introduces us to more characters and one scene a character is killed in a most shocking manner! Word to the wise:this novel has depictions of creatures straight of nightmares and those who suffer arachnophobia might steer clear of this novel.Other than that pick up this book be prepare for another dark,twisted and unforgettable ride!"
4,Wit'ch Storm,"Clemens does a good job of surprising you. It was fast pace reading but kept my attention. I am awaiting the third book in this series to see where Elena and her companions are off to next and what adventures, triumphs and tradgies await them."
2,Won't be reading the sequels,"I bought this book based on the great reviews on Amazon, but I just don't get it. I thought the writing was below average. There was a lot of action packed into the book, but I found it dry and the characters just didn't come to life. I won't be reading the sequel."
3,Fair Collection of Hits and Misses,"Not nearly as worthy as Volume One, this CD places some big hits next to some oddities. Many of the tracks were only minor hits (""Alive Again"" and ""No Tell Lover""), and some were just non-hits (""Gone Long Gone"" and ""Happy Man""), but listeners seeking the uber-ballads ""If You Leave Me Now"" and ""Baby What a Big Surprise"" will find them here. No liner notes"
3,Could use more songs but I really like If You Leave Me Now!!,I love the song If You Leave Me Now which I had heard on the radio several times but never knew the name of the group until I saw the CD in my sister's CD club catalog and I found out it was Chicago I got the CD and basically for that song and also discovered they also sing Baby What A Big Surprise which I had heard once on the radio so not knowing all that much about Chicago I couldn't say if this compilation is very flawed or not but I guess it could use more than 10 songs but anyway I like the CD as I mainly bought it for If You Leave Me Now which is one of my favorite love songs.
4,Worst of the Greatest Hits of Chicago,"Translation:This album doesn't stand among their other ones, but this one still has charm, and helps prove that Chicago is a great group. ""Old Days"", ""Baby What A Big Surprise"", ""If You Leave Me Now"", ""Take Me Back to Chicago"" and ""No Tell Lover"" are the great ones on here."
4,Cute USB drive,I love this thing! It works well and other's really like it. The hole to put a key ring on is a bit small which took one star off.
1,Will break,I would not recommend this flash drive. it is very slow and it broke in less than a year. i lost all my data....
3,"Chicago, in the Disco Age...","Although not on of Chicago's best recordings, this CD is a lot of fun! The brass ROCKS, and it's neat hearing Peter Cetera do disco! If you're a die hard Chicago fan, this CD is a must! If you love disco, you'll be amused, so buy it for the novilty. If you like the Chicago songs you hear on the radio, you might rather look at the new ""Heart of Chicago"" CD's instead!"
2,One of the worst Chicago albums,"I'm sorry. But this is not Chicago's best work. It's not necessarilly a horrible album, but the Chicago from 6 years before is simply not there. Three songs save this album from being a one star wonder. The first is Mama Take, one of the most underrated Cetera songs during his Chicago tenure. Donnie Dacus's Must Have Been Crazy is his best song from his unremarkable stay with the band. ""Loser With A Broken Heart"" is a pretty decent Certera ballad. The other songs fall flat on their faces, and are a disgrace to Chiacgo's legacy, especially the incredibly lame ""Street Player"". Chicago can't do disco."
1,Disaster strikes.,my uncle got me this when i was a kid. i put this in my cassette player and i was dissapointed. this is when you mix Chicago with disco and you get this terrible album! don't buy it! it stinks!
4,The Crew,"Great read, I wasn't expecting the outcome, find out for yourself will be looking for more books by Doggie Brimson in the near future.Paul C."
1,Good thing it was free,"Cliche after cliche. One dimensional characters.I couldn't read this. Prefer his non fiction to this. Not good enough, at all"
3,Why World War I started.,"A nice concise summary of why World War I started. As the author related, in 1914 the European continent had solved many of the issues that caused possible war situations. In several situations, Russia had backed down on possible conflicts with Austria-Hungary. However, a visit to the Balkans by the heir to the Austrian-Hungarian throne resulted in the assassination of him and his wife. Parkinson relates the different conflicts that proceded the actual start of the war and explains how they were resolved. The result of the murder of Franz Ferdinand resulted in the deaths of 13 million people.This is an OK read about the start of World War I. There are many good books out there on this subject, and this is just one of many. A nice concise summary read."
5,your kids will love french litterature .... at last!,"For the first time, Marguerite (11), Louis (16) did understand and appreciate what Proust means for the rest of us! When I brought them to Illiers (the actual name of Combray village, near Chartres)we asked the ""boulanger"" for ""Proust-madeleine"" cakes. But he does not make them anymore. Some shops are for sale, there. Maybe one of Amazon.com readers should settle down and start a ""Proust-cake"" business there. This book is terrific because the graphics are as ""bon-got"" as the text."
5,Charming and fun!,"This was a surprise as you swear you are watching something that the great Hayao Miyazaki did, but this isn't anything from Studio Ghibli.If you like Spirited Away, or My Neighbor Totoro, you will love Kamichu!"
5,Worthwhile Reminder,"This history book reminds us that the Irish were mistreated in their homeland and in the USA when they first arrived. It tells of the heroic efforts to help the impoverished, illiterate populace and of the failed attempts by the British government to deal with a culture so foreign to their own.It is a reminder of how far the Irish have come since the Celtic Tiger is rampant and people from Eastern Europe and the third world are going to Ireland for jobs and better lives.Cecil Woodham-Smith is a British woman."
4,"The mechanics of the famine, short on human aspects","This is a very detailed account of how the famine happened, extensively researched and well supported with historical facts. For all of its detail of budgets, expeditures, and grants, the book fails to fully capture the human side of the tragedy. I found the most moving part of the book the description of the emigrant experience to Canada, where the agony of the fever-sticken, starving Irish was strong and convincing."
3,The Great Hunger,Very good history of a terrible time in Irish history.Book in reasonably good condition for a 50 year old book.
2,What is this?,"I love Schenker, but this cd is just a showcase for his guitar and everyone that ever sang for MSG. It sounds like one long song. There's just no feel to it. It's hard to get into. But hey, if you worship this guy then it's for you."
2,VERY - VERY - DISAPPOINTING! -,I've been a long time UFO & MSG fan (well over 25 years) and sadly I've e got to say this MSG project is a major let down. This concept had so much potential but fell way short musically. The songs with former vocalist are the stronger ones on this CD but are still pretty weak at best. I've never been a huge Robin McAulley fan but his contribution to this project is respectable and probably the only song actually worth listening to more than once. The new vocalist Jari Tiura is absolutely wrong for this project (Michael what were you thinking?) and the guitar solos and hooks are only average at best. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! Sorry Michael... Perhaps next time!
2,Below par,"The guitar work maybe solid but there are only like 2 good songs on the whole cd and most of it sounds the same. Rather boring, yes I a HUGE Schenker fan."
3,"Good effort, mainly for the fans","Most of the 90's MS went to ""holiday"" and suddenly start to produce like nuts.Looking back at his musical achievements and his personal problems, it's good to recognize the consistency but, let's start to be selective.""Tales"" have a few highlights (3-4 songs) mainly the one with Graham Bonett, Robin Mc Auley and two more with the latest singers. To stick all the songs was not a good idea.This record it's for the fans and most important, MSG took the time and effort to celebrate his 25 anniversary.What I ask is, what ever happend to the so call ""musical heroes""? Destiny got them in a exceptional place but, where are the ideas and time to give new music to their fans?Even if they prodeced something ""very good"" in the past, it's lack of enthusiasm make them stink even more and put them like an opportunistics that live of the past. (ej Van Halen, Motley Crue, Poison, Black Sabbath, etc, etc.....)In the end, you have the final choice of buy or not to buy."
2,"19 songs, about 2 are good","I like the creativity for marketing this album: take MSG line-up #862, record a dozen or so songs, and then add a track or two with each MSG frontman on vocals. That's pretty clever, but it doesn't overcome average songwriting.For the Michael Schenker guitar fans, this album will not disappoint. But for those looking for solid tunes, this album is pretty weak. Not surprisingly, the Robin McAuley tune is the stand-out on this offering."
2,Great Guitar Players Are Just That...,"& shouldn't be confused with anything else. All the songs on here are OK, but nowhere near his early stuff w/UFO. Some of the reviews are way too long & too in-depth of this record. Graham Bonnet's tunes are probably the best, but Schenker offers nothing unique or Schenker-esque on this thing. The solos on the endless ""Thank You"" albums are better than these. Re-connect w/UFO (which probably won't happen) or re-form a solid band... w/ either Logan or Bonnet & get a good song-writing partner & do what you do best--play unflattering, mind-bending songs with lyrics that take you places. This record really doesn't do that-----in my opinion. OH, this is cheaper on CD Universe as well."
5,Amazing music,"This CD is a must-have for anyone's collection. The music stirs the soul and takes it to great heights and amazing depths. It is the music for the finest and the most perennial of all human emotions. It speaks of triumph, love, defeat, death, laughter, and rising..... Beautiful and definitely one of the finest set of scores I've ever heard! I listened to it for a few days - nonstop! Captivating!"
5,amazing amp,"this amp is great it goes good with my ltd ex-50 and i love how marshall amps sound, its a great amp with evrything your lookin for the effects sound nice, the fdd feature is great , but the OVERDRIVE is pure metal beast if you lik to play metallica and maiden etc. If not, the clean setting is excellent as well, its a little heavy though."
5,Great replacement!,Great replacement part for the beer tap. Thought we would have to get rid of the the tap since it got broken but found the perfect replacement!
3,Soccer Halfback by Matt Christopher,"Great, but in the middle plot gets dull.Jabber Morris chooses soccer as a sport to play, but his brother, uncle, mother, sister and the town think he should play football. Jabber likes to play soccer, but his family thinks differently. Jabber buys a pair of new soccer shoes, when he does that Pete, his brother, thinks its final that Jabber is going to stick with soccer. Jabber and Pete have the same thinking for one sport and that sport is Hang gliding. But after an accident and his mom talking to him, Jabber rethinks what sport he is going to play for the rest of his life.The realistic fiction book Matt Christopher wrote was ok, but Matt has wrote better sports books. I liked this book because it is about soccer, my favorite sport, but I disliked the book because it didn't keep me into the book. The book is ok but if you want a really interesting book check out some of the other books Matt Christopher. (by Howard L. in Torrance CA.)"
3,"I have to admit, this book was good, but a little cheesy.",Ok. It's about a kid that likes soccer and he plays halfback. His mom and siblings want him to go for football (A little cheesy.) because that was his father played before his recent death. The ending is when his mom says she'll back some hamburgers with some other junk and ketchup. I though that was cheesy.
4,Soccer Halfback,"This book was full of energy. As you know this book is a sports book and is very exciting. The book seems as if the author tells the story with play by play action, making sure you don't miss any action. The book is mainly about a boy who plays soccer, but some of his family really wants him to play football. It is his first year of soccer to and he is very good. That's why it is such a hard decision for him. I recommend this book to middle school kids. The vocabulary isn't hard and it's really just a book that's fun to read."
2,Socer Halfback,"Jabber Halpkins is in the team, the Razorbacks. Throughout the year he and his team play against the Blue Jackets. The team goes through team problems with injuries and people quitting, but they win and beat the toughest team ever and make some new friends. I recommend this book to book worms that like sports."
5,A Thrilling Book!,"I think that the author, Matt Christopher, was really imaginative when he wrote this book. This book kept me in suspense. Jabber, {the main character}was very sad and unhappy at some points in the book, but he was very happy in the beginning and in the end of the book. I wanted to know which soccer team was going to win. This book is filled with fun and excitement! I would really recommend this book for third, fourth, fifth, and sixth graders. It was very hard for me to put Soccer Halfback down, and I don't think that you will be able to put this book down either!"
3,"Well, it has a small audience that wasn't me...","While short and sweet, this book will tell you how to create only one kind of Biblical sermon because the author makes clear that any others are sinful and against the word of God. I found his chapters to be easily laid out and well supported with biblical interpretation, but I wish he'd quoted some other homeletics scholars because he sounds a little prideful about his work. This is a great book if you already agree with him."
2,"Paced FULL of info, but.....","Very annoying to use because all of the questions are in front of the book and the answers are in the back, so you are constantly flipping back and forth from question to answer."
5,On top of my list for all-time best exercise books,This book was given to me as a present and I loved it so much that I already have given away three copies to friends and I am back to order more.I have been power walking for many years and I find it a great and strong form of exercise. But it always upset me to see other people/friends walk without proper guideance and consequently not achieve the full benefits.This book is wonderfully illustrated and a joy to leaf through.It gives great instructions and addresses everything.I bet you'll love it too.
4,inspired me,This is a great book to get ya going! Lots of good info and great pics. I refer back to it all the time.
2,Signs of Life,"After several mediocre outing recently, it would appear that this veteran and elite jazz group has decided to foster a measure of creativity, energy and a measure of passion, although a tad more passion would have improved this CD immensely. Moreover, one would hope that they both maintain and expand on their latent (on this CD) creativity, energy and passion to continue to produce the kind of music that these truly gifted musician are capable of producing, if history is any guide a return to form is definitely in the offing."
3,nostaglic comic,"This a video for baby boomers who grew up reading superman/superboy comics in the sixties. It's a nostalgia trip. Unfortunatly, it's probably too slow for young people today."
2,SuperCheese,"I loved it for nostalgia sake, but even so I have to admit this wasn't classic animation by a long shot. Having been in the animation industry back in the late 80s, I recognize this genre as ""TV animation,"" or ""Saturday morning animation"" and certainly wouldn't have made Walt Disney proud.Which brings me back to this particular ""Superboy"" collection. OK, so why am I drawn to this material? Well, in the late 60s, I was a huge comics fan, particularly of DC's ""Super"" franchise. Plus, the theme song....while fairly cheesy...was so thrilling! I remember renting this video for my son in the late 80s, but I was the one who ended up darn near wearing the tape out!"
4,Entertaining and Intriguing,"If Walls Could Talk begins with the murder of Raymond, a childhood friend of Detective Joe Johnson, who is found murdered in his bed after an obvious sexual encounter. Raymond's fiance is pregnant and is considered a suspect along with several other people, including people that Raymond may have crossed or interfered with on a professional level. To complicate matters, Joe becomes attracted to the twin sister of the pregnant fiance, and is torn between protecting her feelings and finding out the truth.If Walls Could Talk is entertaining and intriguing. The book is full of interesting subplots including Joe's possessive girlfriend who becomes his ex-girlfriend once Joe meets Sierra. There is an interesting twist in the novel when it turns out that Raymond was also bedding his fiance's mother. If you like drama mixed with mystery, If Walls Could Talk is a good book to curl up with on the sofa and dig your eyes into.Reviewed by Zane"
5,If Walls Could Talk,When I first started reading this book I said to myself I have never read anything like this before. I read the very first chapter and was glues to the book ever since. The way that Vincent keeps you in suspense through out the whole book is great. I wanted to help the detectives out through out the book. I found myself saying it couldn't be her and who left the message on the machine. I really enjoyed the book and look forward to reading more of Vincent's book in the future.
4,Twisted Desires among Twisted Folks,"If Walls Could Talk what would they say ,about the night of April 17th and the Dupree family ! Just who could , would , and did kill Raymond Tyler? This murder mystery was one I enjoyed especially because of the romance ! I love a good mystery with some romance . There were so many suspects to predict and I was pleased my prediction was the right one ! A good murder mystery with twisted desires and twisted folks . There were clues along the way ! No I will not tell !"
3,Victorian Travelogue,"I've loved the musical and movie versions of this story since forever, so it was a no-brainer to finally read the book. As with many memoirs of travelers from this period, the story was less plot and more historical and cultural details of Siam than anything. The book's story is familiar to everyone and the style is full of Victorian British Exceptionalism and rife with unconscious bigotry - but that part is to be expected.If one appreciates the Victorian writing style, then this is a good example of and worth the read. If you're not familiar with this style, it's still worth a read, but it's probably not what you're expecting."
3,"The British Women, Anna","This is one of a few books which are written by Anna Leonowens herself as a English teacher in Siam. For those of you who wants to know more about Anna herself and her dairy, should read this book. It describes the Siamese court from a historical point of view, bring you back to 19th century."
1,Bunch of Hooey!,"This book should be listed under ""historical fiction"" or ""Mere Opinions of an English Imperialist Victorian Woman"". The book upon which the fun movie ""The Kind and I"" is based, is only the very jaundiced view by an arrogant Victorian Englishwoman of Thai life in the age of Imperialism and not in the slightest a reflection of the true reality. Her portrayal of King Mongkut (Rama IV) borders on libel. Instead of the ignorant barbarian she portrays he was actually an incredibly cultured and sophisticated and enlightened man who, among other things, saved his country from colonization (only Thailand, Japan, and Ethiopia were not subjected by the imperialist powers in the 19th century) by playing the English off against the French while cultivating good relations with them. For a true portrayal of the kind and the times, read MONGKUT, KING OF SIAM, by A.L. Moffat, not this book."
3,"Art is gorgeous, but...",The art part of the book is outstanding. Beautiful. Can't say enough good things about it.The hint book half leaves a good bit to be desired. The print it tiny. The clues are confusing. The information is incomplete. You'd be better off just using the first part (about the dress-sphere and garment grids) and the last part (about the mini-games) and forgetting the middle part.
2,Disappointed fanatic,"There are 5 tracks on this disc. The first is an album version, followed by three techno versions which barely contain any content from the original song, and the last track which is a chopped version with a slight groove to it. The only song I bother listening to is the last one. As a true fan and avid collector, I was disappointed."
5,"Lewis Wetzel,Indian Fighter: The Life and Times of a Frontie","It's been over thity years since I've read this. As a child it was spell binding. Full of suspense and intrigue, I could'nt put the book down until it was finished! As it was, it required a written letter and several phone calls from our hometown librarian to demand the return of this publication back to the library!As it turned out,a Lady in the vicinity,(who happened to be a direct descendant of Lewis Wetzel) refused to hand over the book.There was only one copy of this publictionin our library. So I to wait like, almost an eternity to read this book!"
1,GODD OLD PENT.,"THIS IS MORE LIKE THE PENTHOUSE STORIES THAT ARE FUN TO READ. NO ONE EXCEPT RIGHT WING RELIGIOUSPEOPLE SHOULD BE UJPSET AN KEEP IN MIND, THOSE FOLKS SOULD NOT BE READING THIS TYPE OF BOOKIN THE FIRST PLACE. RATED B"
4,"""Hot"" Something New","This release is not the typical release from ATL or anywhere else down south but, Needles show skills with tight flows and they rep their spot (ZONE 3) to the fulliest."
3,Do Not Try This Book At Home.,"This book is dense in the sense of Rudin (actually much denser); it packs a lot of material into a little space and that material can take hours for a grad student to decode. In other words, its the perfect textbook for an independent study! As a reference book, this is a good introduction to the state of differential equations *before* Lorenz equations were understood. Keep in mind that this was written in Russa during the Stalin era, and so some of the terminology is different. In particular, they refer to Gromwall's Inequality as ""The Fundamental Inequality."" The proofs are not that elegant, but they'll give a modern student a good idea of where some numerical techniques come from. Without guidance, though, an untrained reader could be left completely confused as to the state of differential equations in the 1990's. Don't try this at home."
1,"stupid, dont buy",this movie was a waste of time and money its too bad that they dont let u view it before u buy it. i dont reccomend it.
3,If you have nothing else to do...,"There are many scenes that seem completely pointless. Fortunately, this movie is only 58 minutes long so you don't waste a lot of time on it if you don't like it. The element of a surprise ending doesn't exist. The dialogue in the beginning of the movie pretty much spells everything out for you. If you like horrible horror movies, you may enjoy. Otherwise, don't waste your time if you can't find the humor in it."
1,granny,This is the worse movie I have ever seen. The Actor's have no talent. A big waste of time. WARNING!!! Don't rent this movie. You will waste your money. They should pay you to watch it.
4,beginner Oracle DBA,Good book for a starter. I have SQL 2000 exp and wanted to get a quick overview. Could have added a chapter on installation and tools installation ? Oracle installation has always proved to be a dog on Windows environment.
3,A little too basic if you have any Oracle background at all,"I thought that this book was O.K. Unfortunately, I ended up taking it back because it wasn't quite what I needed. I would suggest this book to anyone who has absolutely no clue about being a DBA or Oracle8.x. The first 100 or so pages are dedicated to providing the reader insight into the world of database administration. This book gives some worthwile information on db setup, and not as much specific information as I would like to see on the actual job(s) that a dba does. My suggestion is to combine this book with another (Oracle8i DBA reference or Oracle8i reference). Overall, this book gives decent elementary knowledge of the world of Oracle, but unless you are a complete novice to Oracle/dba buy another book, or look for something more intermediate."
2,May Not Very Good,"I have not been able to complete this book, but I do think that it is rather difficult for a beginner doing self-study. Please, look elsewhere!"
1,Not recommended for a newbie,"I bought this book to use as a guide to beginning to learn Oracle. The first chapter was great but that's all I can say about it. I have a little database experience but was still very confused and frustrated by chapter 3. Haven't even been able to use it as much of a reference, either. I'm going to try to trade it in, probably for a text that comes with a CD. I, too, was VERY disappointed."
1,confusing,This book is very confusing for a first timer. I don't think the author put any real effort in to helping newbies learn Oracle. I am very disappointed with this book. Don't wast your money!
3,Oracle DBA 101,"I seldom wrote any book comments due to my poor English writing. I consider myself as an Oracle DBA beginner and want to lie on my resume. Though I have completed the whole book I still feel confused about the Oracle architecture and basic Oracle DBA commands. This book is not a good reference book for a starter. Besides, this book doesn't cover some preliminary but important topics such as Oracle Network and background processes. If you just like me want to cheat on your resume to get a DBA job, get a different book."
1,Please don't buy this if you're brand new to Oracle!,"I chose this book because it claimed to be written for complete beginners. It lulls you into feeling completely comfortable with chapters on how the authors really want to help others through the rough early stages and then, pardon the language, all hell breaks loose. Almost as soon as it starts into the technical aspects, it will jump way over your head. Although I finally understood the first several chapters, I tossed the book aside when I realized I had to read and reread most of it, which, as an overworked Systems Engineer, I just don't have time for. Now that I've gleaned some knowledge of Oracle, I use it as a secondary reference for commands and such. Please do yourself a favor and look for another book if you need to get up to speed quickly and easily."
1,New to Oracle? Skip this book!!!,"I'm totally new to Oracle and have purchased this book after reading all of the reviews at Amozon.com. Unfortunately, this isn't the book you need if you have no idea about Oracle. As someone mentioned already, first two chapters were OK, but that's all. Starting from the third chapter, everything gets very confusing and has very little explanation. The language used in this book is way far from being easy to understand, and is very hard to follow for the newbie."
4,Doing Business As.........an ORACLE DBA,"I just got ORACLE 101 and haven't put it down. I have been a DBA for quite some time and this book has added value not just for beginners but for everyone. Even if you know it all, it's good to go back and review the basics. Or to speak to the non-DBA types using the analogies that this book provides to convey ourselves and what we do."
3,Not sure about this one for beginners,"I have a bit of experience with Oracle and thought that this book would be great for me since I still consider myself to be a beginner DBA. This books seems nothing but confusing. It does do a decent job of speaking in layman's terms but also assumes to much of the reader. It also doesn't do much in the way of visuals. I thought many of the topics should have included print screens for visual affect, I did get quite a bit out of the book but much of it I had to go directly to hands on to really understand what the heck they were talking about."
2,Too basic to be really useful,"The text is too basic to be a realy useful reference. If you've got any Oracle experience, you'll probably skim through most of the text. Sure, you'll pick up a pointer here and there--but that'd be the case with nearly any book.I guess if you're not an Oracle user but want some familiarity (say, you're a technical Project Manager, or you're an experienced SQL Server DBA moving to Oracle)--maybe then this would be a good review. But otherwise, it's too simple for even a ""101"" rating."
5,"At last a book for beginners,Oracle DBA 101","Of all the books on the market Oracle DBA101 helps the people who trully need help, the beginner. There are few books on the market that help the beginner get started on the right foot. Most books are geared toward the Oracle Guru and totally bypass the novice. Most authurs expect you to have years of experience, this is the only book on the market that helps you get started right, learning Oracle is no easy task and this book pulls no punches. I have read books that say they are for the beginner but leave you more confused and fustrated then when you started. Oracle DBA 101 is the only book on the market that will help you de-mystify the wonderful world of Oracle DBA. I have found the book to be worth it, it has personaly helped me on my way to becomming an Oracle DBA and I KNOW IT CAN HELP YOU! There is no doubt in my mind that this book will be the standerd that all Oracle DBA books will be judge on."
2,"Concepts, not details","This book explains Oracle concepts very clearly and conversationally. But it doesn't actually tell you how to *do* much. It tells you what some of the steps of creating a database are (for example), but not what the commands to do them are. It reminds you what parameters you need to set to appropriate values, but doesn't tell you how to determine what an appropriate value might be. Examples are erratic -- sometimes it gives you a script and doesn't show you what the output will be, or shows you a table and doesn't explain what it means.This might be a useful companion to a syntax-oriented class, or for a junior DBA who's been performing steps by rote for a few months and wants to understand what's really going on. It's a pleasant read, very friendly, uses lots of analogies (some of which are not really useful enough). But it will *not* help you get started actually doing Oracle DBA work, nor would it make a good reference book in my opinion."
5,I've not found a better starting block,"I have not finished reading it yet and I consider myself a ""newbie"", but it's the sort of book I wish I had come across before many others I've explored. I would say it's an excellent book for beginners. It's not a complete reference but I've not found a better starting block."
5,Essential how-to guide for the Oracle DBA,"If you're a new Oracle DBA and you need a thorough how-to guide and a concise reference, this is the book for you. The authors explain what you need to do in real-life DBA situations, and why. I teach Oracle database administration at the university level, and have found that this book is the best available for teaching my students how to be a successful Oracle DBA - and they don't need to sell the book back at the end of the semester!"
3,Not for beginners,"I agree with some of the other reviewers in that it starts out with very basic(OS concepts, disks, etc.) and immediately delves into intricate ,complex detail. It tries to illustrate too many concepts by scripts, which is assuming the reader is a proficient PL/SQL programmer. I found myself having difficulty following the concept because I couldn't understand the pages and pages of scripts. I could see that the scripts would be helpful later on for daily administration. Also, it would help a lot if there were more drawings to illustrate ideas."
3,Bought it for the iron-on,"Chicago's always great. I already had it on CD but wanted the iron-on (included with the LP). Mine had worn out from the first purchase. This LP's not on the same level with the first three but there are some great cuts here: ""Brand New Love Affair"" (a jazz musician's heaven) and ""I've Never Been in Love Before."" Didn't really care for the hits on the LP: ""Harry Truman"" and ""Old Days."" Chicago's at its best when it mixes jazz with rock. Love those horns!"
3,"""Average""-- but still Chicago","I guess everybody has ""off"" days, and of all the albums put out by Chicago while Terry Kath was still around, this may rank only just above ""Carnegie Hall"". Somehow no less than 3 singles were pulled off this (""Harry Truman"", ""Old Days"", ""Brand New Love Affair""), yet NONE of them made a dent in the airwaves. So this tends to get overlooked as Chicago albums go, which is a shame, as it's not without its merits. Like the driving, almost hypnotic ""Hideaway"", Terry Kath's bizarre excursion ""Oh, Thank You Great Spirit"" (which apparently describes the journey of a man who's just died-- and goes to meet his maker with a smile on his face!) or ""Anyway You Want"", which would have been MY pick for a hit single. Things like this often make me wonder WHO picks the singles off some albums?"
1,The group's worst ever recording,"There is one good song on here-the RAY CHARLES like Brand New Love affair.Everything else is horrible. Robert Lamm started burning out about now and Terry Kath began his plung into depression and finally suicide. Poor guy,poor band. One good thing about this album;we didn't have to listen to Pete Cetera singing his sickening balladesque music."
3,ehhh...its ok,"If I could do it all over I would spend the extra twenty and get the wilson evolution. I'll end up doing that and using this for an outdoor ball. Its heavier than Id like and throws me off because Im a 3 point assassin. So when I warm up with my ball and then switch to the game ball, I have to make adjustments. DOnt be cheap like i was, go ahead and buy a better one."
5,Great ball.,"I see that the price of the ball went down since I bought it, which is even better! Except that at $24 and change, it is not valid for free shipping. Definitely satisfied with the ball, nonetheless."
2,Got the Wrong Size,"Spalding has been less than impressive to me. I bought this one and it turned out to be a junior-size basketball (oops, that was my fault). So I bought the actual NBA-size indoor/outdoor one and the skin on it wore off after about a month of usage. I wouldn't recommend it, I bought a different brand afterwards, (Under Armour) and their basketball has held up much longer and better so far."
5,Great gift for a teen,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for a teenager. He loved it, he plays with it constantly, it's a good alternative to video games."
2,Get the Spalding Tack soft.,i had this ball and it was ok. on a scale of one to ten its about a 3 or 4. too much cushion and feels weird when bounced. the tack soft on the other hand is a much better ball.
5,May be a nice ball but,"This seemed like a nice ball, but it had a crease in it when we got it. My husband tried to blow it up to try and get rid of the crease, but it would not go away so we had to send it back and try a different one."
2,Nice ball but ..,"Nice ball it come inflated, but looks like anyone check it before sending the item come irregular and not bounce properly."
1,Don't Be Fooled,"Don't buy this ball thinking that you're getting an ""official NBA game ball"" - it's not leather, it's a composite. Anyone interested in a genuine leather ball (for indoor use only) should look at the Official NBA Game Ball that retails from about $75-$90. Spalding makes the official ball but it's just not this one. I can't speak to the value of this ball, never having played it, but most indoor/outdoor balls have short lives - go out of round and develop lopsidedness within a relatively short time."
2,How long should a ball last?? 1 day?,"As a keen Ball player for over 20 years, I would think I know a little about quality Basketballs.I'm not going to waste anyones time here, so here are the facts;The ball looks and feels great, it grips real well and has that dark tan leather look about it.First time I used it on hard wood (indoor court)the panels started lifting! I didn't use it in a game this was for warm up before the game so I maybe got 20 minutes light use out of it!I took it outdoors and to no surprise it shredded.if you're looking for a ball to hang on a mantle to look good with some superstars autograph on it; this is your ball, but if you actually want to get any playtime out of it, look elsewhere! I'm sending mine back."
2,Spalding 64-497 Official NBA Zi/O Excel Basketball,This model seems to be a cheaper version of previously purchased models. Not sure what the reason for the lower quality is.
5,Love!,This is Christmas gift for my son. He loves to play basketball.He plays for his school. He is always dreaming about seeing NBAstars and watching they play games. He carries the boy everywhere hegoes. I am proud of him.
3,decent but a little too rubbery,"This ball handles pretty well and still has most of its grip after about 3 months of outdoor play (a couple times per week), but it's a little too hard and rubbery for my taste (especially when it's chilly outside). In the future I would prefer something a bit softer and more leather-like such as the Spalding Tack Soft model."
4,still goning,"We have not playing this ball that much since received, due to the winter weather.It is still going strong."
4,Great Basketball,Bought two of these for my son so they could play a game requiring two basketballs. Both are great quality and really good for outside on the driveway. I am satisfied and happy with these balls.
3,great in the beginning but loses outer grip,"It was great for the first few months. I play outdoor 1-2 times a week but after about 4 months, the great grip that was on it was pretty much all worn out. It's not that great anymore and slips out of the hands quite easily now. I played outdoor exclusively though. For the price, it was okay."
5,Nice feel,"This is an excellent indoor/outdoor ball. I bought it a year ago for my son who plays basketball year-round, and I use it when we play together. It is as good as any of the 20 or so balls I've had over the years of playing and coaching. It is softer with a better feel than most outdoor balls, with a pseudo-leather texture and grip. It's not quite as good of a feel as an expensive indoor leather ball, but those balls would be ruined by outdoor play. It has held up well over the year of abuse. I don't know of a better indoor/outdoor ball, regardless of cost."
2,Build Quality,"Got this ball last night. The grip felt very good. Took a couple of dribbles on the hardwood floor down in the basement, to my surprises, one of the panels started to tear, showing yellowish color from the edge. It's quite a disappointment given I'd been waiting for this ball for almost a week and was ready to get some play time with it this saturday. I am returning it now and going to my local store to find a wilson ball now... btw, I am not sure if it is an issue with spalding quality control. The spalding official street ball I bought more than 10 years ago still shows no sign of any tear."
2,Review For This Book,"I agreed with one of the previous reviewers. This book has a lot of information, but very little pictures. This book can be made better by including a picture with the descriptions of the weapons. Curiously, the book has a small section, O.k., barely there, on Smith and Wesson Pistols and Revolvers despite the important contributions of this gun manufacturers. What little there was on this manufacturer was from pre-World War II, nothing from the latter part of the 20th century. Although I had read and own other gun books by Ian Hogg, I found this book disappointing even though Mr. Hogg is considered to be a notable authority in the areas of firearms through his work with the publication Jane's Infantry Weapons."
2,Not really a lot of data in this book.,"If you like me you like to see the pictures of the firearms as well as a description. This book does not. It has plenty of information on guns and a list of guns and their specifications. There are only a couple of pages of photos in the middle of the book but can't make up for it. All in all if you need information on gun calibers, manufactures, and gun vocabulary but without the pictures you should get this book but i don't really recommmend it there are much more better books out there like some of Ian's other books."
4,So This Is How Chicago Started Out!,"There can be few people who have not heard some of Chicago's superb ballards from the mid 1970s onwards, Wishing You Were Here, If You Leave Me Now and many others.This debut from 1969 would appear to have been recorded by an entirely different band, in fact although at the time they were known as Chicago Transit Authority, basically the same personell were responsible.This may be the first debut double album ever released and it includes some experimental rock/jazz fusions which are anything other than predictable.The 12 tracks are mostly over 5 minutes long and they range from Free Form Guitar, which is what it says, to I/m A Man, which takes The Spencer Davis' Group's song and make's it there own.At just under 80 minutes, all on 1 CD, this may be too much to listern through all at once, nevermind it bears hearing time and again, it's loud and brash, no wonder Jimi Hendrix was a fan!"
5,A brilliant beginning,"I actually haven't heard Rhino's remaster release of this gem, but I just got a hold the ""Chicago Records"" issue. I had forgotten how great this album was. It truly borders on genius with wonderful arrangements, inspired guitar playing and great performances. I remember as a kid being baffled after listening to this album and then comparing it to the weak pop albums that came later on.The sound on the Chicago Records release is worlds better than the Chicago II CD. Still not great, but quite listenable. I would recommend this to anyone who likes hard driving rock with some vibrant horns."
4,Good... but not Chicago II,"Chicago is one of the best alternate rock bands ever to grace the vast and exciting ocean of rock'n'roll. Their musical style, a blend of rock, classical, and jazz is... of course unique, but its also very energetic. This, the bands first album is good...really good, though its not quite as good as there second album. The best songs on this album are, ""I'm a Man"", "" South California Purples"", and ""Liberation"". Buy it, listen to it all, then buy Chicago II."
3,"It's OK, but not the best","Well, it's a good start for the band, but it's too much noise and senseless tracks here. It could be a great single album instead of a double one."
2,DISAPPOINTING,"THIS ALBUM FAILS WITH TOO LONG OF INSTUMENTAL SECTIONS IN MANY SONGS. THAT MAKES THESE SONGS VERY DULL. OF COURSE, ""LIBERATION"" IS COMPLETELY INSTRUMENTAL AND VERY BORING. ""BEGINNINGS"" AND ""QUESTIONS 67 & 68"" ARE THE ONLY SONGS HERE THAT ARE EVEN THE LEAST BIT MEMORABLE. MOST OF THESE SONGS JUST DON'T GO ANYWHERE. THANK GOODNESS CETERA, WITH SOME HELP FROM DAVID FOSTER, EVENTUALLY GOT THIS BAND RIGHT WITH HIS UNERRING SENSE OF MELODY AND SONGCRAFT. THAT CREATED THE NEW AND 100 TIMES BETTER CHICAGO."
5,There it is a origin of Chicago.,"If you want to know real Chicago,you cannot pass this CD.This is their first album appeared to our world with a great shockwave.It has passed almost 30years since its first release,the originality of this first album has not been vanished in there recent albums.You can find out their origin in this CD."
5,Best Chicago album...down hill from there,"The CTA album was great. I went about 25 years without listening to it, and hearing it again was great....this was their best in my opinion, they had their moments later on, such as parts of Chicago V, but there came a point when they should have just ceased and assumed their rightful place in our collective memories. It makes me cringe every time a group called Chicago appears in concert. But once again, CTA was a wonderful, and even cutting edge, album."
3,"Pretty good, not great.","It is divided into two books. One containing the maps which are not connected to the spine, and the other with the list of places and events on the maps. I'd probably recommend this to a younger reader or someone just starting out reading Tolkien. The maps are nicely done yet not really what I expected. Really more of a poster art. The book(s) aren't bad, just not what I expected and I wasn't really impressed."
3,"beautiful, but not what I expected","I purchased this on impluse before Christmas as a gift for my husband. While the maps are beautiful and the book, what I've read so far, interesting, I was really, really hoping for a more detailed map of Hobbiton and environs. The cover of the boxed set implied, to my eye, there would be more detailed coverage of the places in The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings. That said, it is still a nice addition to the library of die-hard Tolkien fans. Just don't expect to study the maps and then be able to day-dream of walking trails in the shire or following the footpaths of the Fellowship through Middle Earth in detail."
2,Children Oriented Poster Maps For 1st Time Readers,"Being an experienced Tolkien reader, having read The Silmarillion, The Hobbit & The Lord of the Rings Trilogy Books several times each, I was very disappointed by the lack of real map-like detail contained on the 4 separate maps. The only thing that was clarified for me by these maps where the position of the ""Eryd Luin"" (Blue Mountains) between the 1st age in the Beleriand Map & the same mountain chain which were shifted in terms of their relationship to the Western Seas in the map of Middle Earth during the 3rd Age due to the opening of the huge Chasm after the fall of Numernor during the 2nd Age."
4,Beautiful and Perfect for Framing,"If you are not ""collecting"" this book to keep forever, the maps are beautiful art and are perfect for framing. I love the colors, so very earthy rich and nature oriented. There are two books in the hard slipcover. The first book is really only a hardcover jacket and contains four loose maps. The maps are folded, which I think is the only drawback to owning these poster maps because when framed, the fold lines do show somewhat. (But I'm only decorating a den with them, not a fancy room.) The second book contains text corresponding to the maps. I think my money was well spent on these beautiful maps. But I am not saving them, I am using them."
5,Very entertaining,"This book is covered in a nice hard-bound, and has nice detailed maps. Looking at the maps can really pull us in to the world that Tolkien created and also i am able to track the progress of Frodo and his ""Fellowship of the Ring"" like being part of the Fellowship itself. I wish that this review will encourage you to buy this book. Alas, more praise should come with this book than i can write."
3,WHERE'S THE COTTON ! ! ! !,WHERE'S THE COTTON ? ? ?I USED TO LOVE THESE SOCKS. EXCEPT NOW THEIR MADE OF CHEAP ACRYLIC N NYLON ! YUCK !WIGWAM....PLEASE..... BRING BACK YOUR 100% COTTON SLOUCH SOCKS !
3,Not like the original ones..,"These socks are okay, but not the same as the original slouch socks from the 80's-90's. These are not soft or stretchy. They are stiff & tight around the top. They don't make your feet warm. I loved the old version much better."
5,Durable and comfortable too.,"These socks are quite nice. They fit well, feel soft and washed up well. I bought this item in white."
4,Good fast read,I read this book for book club and it was a great diversion from our normal reads. If you’re looking for a moral or so profound meaning you’re not going to find it in this book. What you will find are will written witty funny antidotes which make the book good read.
1,"Slow Moving, Badly Edited, Bad Reading","Thought I was in for a thrill and this was pure swill...completely didn't fulfill. TV show was great, fast paced a little racy but warm hearted. This on the other hand was scattered, unclear and in need of firm handed editing and re-writes. It made for a at times dull read even with the spatterings of sex. Of which some may disagree, but could get, at times, slightly disturbing. Although it is clear that the author has a good base in the English language, I wouldn't rush out to buy this. Just didn't meet my needs, I fancied a lighthearted read and this left me slightly despondent and not in the good Wuthering Heigths way."
4,Very exciting and erotic! little mundane at times,I was into the book for the first severl chapters but towards the middle and end found myself skipping the aspects of her personal life and just wanted to read about her sex work life! I enjoyed the alphabet-diary style.
2,I wish I knew about just reading her blog,"I could have just gone to her blog and read it for free.Alas. I bought the e-book and it wasn't a disappointment. It was an all right read, not anything I didn't already know about call girls and escorts (there was a great article online somewhere, about 5 pages that went into a life of a call girl in Toronto who had 2 kids and how she made it work), but it was a good piece of fluff.Would I buy it again? No."
2,How misleading.,"This book was, frankly, a pain. The first part is exactly as advertised: interesting, informational, basic details and protocols for her work in London as a WG, or working girl. This follow's the book's synopsis, and was really what I wanted to read about. Just enough of the way into the book for me to feel obligated to finish it, about 10% in, the book changes to details about her many exes and how she is a perfect ex and all of their other exes are horrible. I quickly grew sick of the many descriptions of going to the gym so she could look at sweat on people's necks. She's vapid, shallow, and uninteresting. I really wanted this to be a femmepowering story of ""I work in the sex trade and I don't have self esteem issues and no one should slut shame me,"" but instead, you receive too much information about all the heart's she's broken and complaints about why she's still single. Disappointing."
3,Diaries,"Well, diaries are always a bit jumbled as they are thoughts and feelings but this was all over the place. Some parts were good as they explained in detail places and events so you could get understanding. However I just found the story line a bit repetitive."
5,Very entertaining!,This is such an entertaining book! Her story keeps you reading and you don't want to put it down. I would love to have lunch with this girl! It's no wonder this was made into a TV show.
3,Books from Blogs,"Sex books from blogs are the thing of the future. As writers reveal their secrets and put them on the web, it is inevitable that the best of them are turned into books. The two best I've read so far are this one and Abby Lee's Diary of a Sex Fiend: Girl with a One Track Mind. Both are English. Both are sexy. Both are ""stimulating"" and honest."
4,Like candy -- naughty and delicious,"I first became interested in reading this book when I started watching Secret Diary of a Call Girl on Showtime. I really like Belle's voice. She's frank, often funny, and not at all a bad writer. Do I think all of her stories are true? Not hardly, but who cares? This was a fun, escapist read. But if you don't enjoy detailed and explicit talk about all manners of sex, this book is not for you. If you've read this book and enjoyed it, I recommend the Showtime series. They've managed to capture the voice and attitude perfectly."
2,bkb,"This gal would have a interesting story if she would have left her boyfreinds out of it which is 60% of the story, her going out with her many boyfreinds."
3,Kind of upsetting,"For once the TV series is much much better than the book! I found this book to be wity sometimes and rather dull the rest... While the author makes some great points she never ever finishes her train of thought, which makes it rather boring! I'm just going to stick to the TV series from now on, since she does a much better job then the actual real life character! So much for a good ""guilty pleasure"" read!"
2,Untitled,"This book left me feeling deflated. She is brutally honest about some of her work experiences, however it is obvious she is embellishing some pieces and not being totally honest with others. In other cases she is contradictory or naive. She is certainly articulate and educated and spends her time with powerful cashed up customers, who can pay for any whim they wish, as long as she agrees. Lets face it, this is the oldest profession in the world and Belle de Jour seems to take to it with a relish. It is written in colloquial English. The style of writing is at times difficult to follow and sometimes irritating. However she seems to think she is quite clever with this. In summary OK for a once only read.PS I did like the series with Billie Piper."
1,A disappointing read...,"Whoever wrote the narrative on the inside cover flap did a fantastic job - it made me immediately purchase the book. I kept reading, thinking that maybe there might be more interesting plot, story, anything. But alas, I finished the book bitterly disappointed. If thats all it takes to get published these days, I have 70 volumes of mind numbing journals I want to get published as quickly as possible. I hate to say it, but it's one of the worst I've ever read."
1,Don't purchase this,"This was not what I expected. I just bought my Kindle and downloaded this diary. It is not a memoir. I have tried to delete this off of my Kindle and I am having trouble. This is a disgusting blog,not a story about someone's life and why they fell into this profession. I want my money back!"
1,Very BAD couldn't finish it,"I am a memoir fanatic, and I purchased this book thinking it would be an introspective peak into the emotional drama of a call girl. It was NOT. All it seemed to be was a girl bragging about her unusual and disturbing sexual habits, and I felt so grossed out reading this book, that I can no longer be in the same room as it. I tried skipping around the chapters and gave it multiple chances, but this book stinks in my eyes."
1,disappointing,"If you are here because you love the Secret Diary of a Call Girl series, please DO NOT buy this book; in this instance, the book is not better than the screen adaptation. The book's Belle is not one quarter as charming or likable as the show's Belle. I tried multiple times, but I could not finish this book.If you decide to purchase, you can look forward to:a) descriptions of the undergarments Belle wears day-to-dayb) sex scenes that are far from juicy or even intriguingc) Belle describing how irresistible others find herd) Belle reminiscing about her failed personal relationships"
4,Not what I expected,"I was glad the book was available (thank you merchant!) but the read was certainly not what I expected. I was a huge fan of the Showtime series, and the interview with the author (revealed a few years ago). Interesting read, nonetheless."
4,Love Belle de Jour,"Aside from being an accomplished and desired escort, the author is an excellent writer. Her stories are amusing and detailed. I would have liked less details from her life and more from her work, but oh well."
4,A must read for any baseball historian.,"Anyone who feels that Pete Rose should be reinstated to baseball should read this book. Pete Rose was a great player, but a zero as a human being."
3,a touch of lounge,"A hard to get album that was - to my knowledge - only released in Japan...Yasmeen's voice is ok but not strong. Her songs are more dreamy and have a touch of lounge-music. This fits her voice. For a soul-album I would expect something differently though. So it is a bit obvious, why it was never commercially released. Anyway, it's a good gem for your soul collection."
1,disappointed,I'm very disappointed in this product. Some photos scan with a dark line down the middle when there's no dark line in the original photo. Other photos scan so bright you can't make out the people.
1,Disappointed,"Working with emergency communication using a ham radio, I needed a portable scanner. I expected to be very pleased, but instead, was very disappointed. After scanning a few pages, I packed it away.The next time I attempted to use it, the motor ran, but it would not grip the paper to take it through the scanner. A friend opened it and did something. It worked once, then the next paper became crooked. After waiting, I pulled it gently out which involved about 2"".The gripper doesn't work anymore.I'm looking for another brand. Found one Amazon.com is selling that has 5 stars. I'll try that one."
5,The Sinatra Solution-Metabolic Cardiology,"Amazing book,Essential for anyone who has CHF or heart disease. My husbandfollowed the nutritional suppliment regime and his Cardiologist is impressedwith the improvement. We even purchased a copy of Dr Sinatra's book for the Cardiologist."
4,Metabolic Cardiology,Very good. The best of a few books I've read on the details of treating cardiology problems metabolicly. I'd read a friend's copy and wanted to have one of my own.
4,Metabolic ardiology,"Metabolic Cardiology is an amazing insight of creating a healthy heart, or at best, strengthening the heart. I am truely impressed. Some of the information is hard for the average person to understand, but has huge amounts of suggestions to improve hearts. A must read!"
3,A Technical Read,"After hearing Dr. Sinatra on NPR, I immediately ordered this book. Unfortunately for me, it is packed with so much technical information I found it difficult and a little boring to read.Although he sums everything up in the last chapter with guidelines for everyone from couch potatoes to elite athletes to people with heart disease, I wouldn't recommend buying this book unless you are truly interested in the bio-chemistry behind his recommendations."
5,Buy it ... you won't regret it,"This is an excellent book if you have any concerns about your heart. I read it first from the library, then bought the kindle edition for myself and the paperback for a friend. I am 83 years old, live by myself and like to garden as much as I can. I have had congestive heart failure for six years and since I started taking the recommended supplement suggestions my energy level has improved considerably. I wish I had read it earlier. Its so good to have enough energy to get through the day and do some of the extra things that I like to do. I highly recommend this book."
3,Good information,Especially if you have a background in organic chemistry. Read Reverse Heart Disease now for more accessible advice. This was a tough slough to get through.
4,Educational material,Read several times to let it soak in good. I have implemented changes to my supplement list. Worth the read just for the education.
4,Interesting,"The doctors writing these books spend a lot of pages telling about how the body works and how you get these conditions. I think most of everyone who has a medical problem knows all that already and are just interested in learning the alternatives to treatment and cures outside of ""normal"" medical practices. All that is really needed in this one is the last pages with the vitamin formulas for your specific problem."
4,Cool,"Make sure that the 8/32 hole for the ejector is completely tapped. If the screw meets any resistance go to the hardware store and get a 8/32 threading screw. It is a cheap fix to ensure your lack of headache length doesn't matter your taking it back out anyways. That should help with the shallow notch on the provided screw. Sometimes mossberg doesn't thread it through all the way. With the mounting plate and the screw through the trigger guard DO NOT OVER TIGHTEN! you will strip out the small aluminum threads then the saddle will swing all along the side of the gun.I've done all the above, Hope this helps. Other then installer error. It is a sturdy tight design and I like it. :)"
5,Great Book on Prayer,"COMMITTED BUT FLAWED is the best book on prayer I've read in a long time. Mr. Murphey gives superb insights and tips on how to pray with fresh eyes and an open heart. I would highly recommend it to anyone and everyone. The author's writing style is simple and easy to read-the mark of a talented craftsman-and he shares his own struggles to pray more effectively. Rather than preach to his audience, he leads them by the hand, showing them the steps he has taken, and helps them to overcome obstacles."
1,bogus ines dela fressange,"disappointed!!! i didnt get the one i ordered.. the old ines de la fressange is the one i wanted, but instead i got the new version totally different scent!!! and im very specific with the one i ordered."
3,Misleading Title,"This book focuses on the author's experiences in a Spanish prison and his efforts, decades later, to get another junkie into rehab. It does not deal directly with the author's own struggle to overcome heroin addiction.The prose accounts of the author's first-hand experiences are more interesting (and in my opinion more skilfully written) than his poetry. I would like to see these prose sections expanded. The book could also benefit from more copyediting."
4,Helps You to Get Inside...,This small journal of an heroin addict certainly helped to broaden my awareness and sensitivity to some aspects of addiction. This book resolved my personal issue/question of real people wanting to regain control.
4,Good MD player but the price is too high,"The only bad thing about the MZ-R55 is the life of the battery.The rechargable bubble gum stick battery only last for 4 hours. Ifyou want a better MD player made by Sony, wait for the MZ-R90 or the MZ-R91. They both cost around $350 and are coming to the US very soon. Probably before March."
4,Minidisc,This player is pretty good. Not really worth the money and the way things are going everything will be on memory sticks of some kind. I wouldn't buy this unless you have money that you don't know what to do with. If you do purchase this product be careful of the remote is a peice of junk and breaks easily.
2,Advice from a norwegian outdoorer.,"I think this product stinks. This is a to fragile player. If you, like me, acctually take this outdoors, you will be amazed over how few real beatings it can take."
3,Super CD Player........as long as you don't exercise with it,"This is one of the best CD players I have ever owned. It makes excellent copies when recording your own CD and the quality of sound on the playback is excellent! However, I can only give it 3 stars because when jogging with it - the main reason I bought it - it skips constantly. It can play nonstop for 20 minutes and then skip for the next 20 minutes. I have tried to wear or hold it every way possible when running and haven't found a solution yet. But if you're looking for a mini-cd that you can make your own CD's with and have a small player with great sound to carry around.....this is the one to own!"
2,WAY TOO FRAGILE,"I've been using it for about 6 months, and I love the sound quality and everything about it.....except its duribility. I dropped it about three feet to a carpeted floor, and now it skips horribly. (hopefully sony will redeem their warranty)"
3,Not the one to get,"So, you're interested in a Minidisc, eh? Good choice! Minidiscs are just great, beat the pants off CDs and MP3 for portable music. After learning to transfer MP3s to a Minidisc, I'll never go back again, I have seen the light!Now, about this particular player. The size is wonderful, if you have had one of the larger players, you just won't believe the size of this. It is small and light and wonderful to carry around. However, as others have mentioned, battery life sucks. There really are better choices. I personally went with the MZ-R90, and it is superb. Tiny, tiny recorder/player with excellent battery life and great features. Unfortunately, Amazon.com does not carry it yet, but there definitely are places you can get them now with a US warranty. Check around."
2,NOT for an active lifestyle,"If you want this unit to go out biking or blading or running, you are out of luck. I bought mine last May; by the end of Summer, and after a couple of accidental normal pulls the headphones stop working. At the juncture of the cable and the plug from the remote the inner cables became exposed. Then I dropped the unit from a 3 feet hieght and it stopped working all together. I'm really sorry I bought this thing."
4,A good MD device,"It's really light, the design is very nice. the sound is good and it doesn't skip at all, but the headphones are horrible (if you buy this, buy a good headphones too) and the volume of a non optic output recording is very low comopared to a volume of a normal cd player... that's bad. still it's a good device."
3,Quite an adventure - says a lot for youth leaders.,"I liked it - a real adventure! As a youth leader who as led similar outdoor adventures, I think this movie has a powerful message. Sometimes, adults are not as secure as they seem. Kevin Bacon plays an ""expert"" outdoorsman and youth leader who struggles with the strong will of an inter-city boy. This was a fun movie with an appropriate PG rating."
3,Sorry but I like this movie,"This is one movie that I like with Kevin Bacon, because he isnt such a pretty Boy and he is a jerk in it. Plus the cast is pretty awesome (Corey haim Baby!) Anyway, you gotta at least watch it. If you like the wilderness and camping you might like it!"
1,if only they'd not been rescued.,"few movies are this annoyingly, cloyingly awful. Always be suspect of a film that 'bookends' the main story with a narrator, moreso when that narrator has aged two or three years from the time the rest of the story was filmed. I'd love to find out the story behind this one, but never, ever, ever want to see it again."
3,"The best ""B"" movie I've ever seen","This movie is definately not Blockbuster/Oscar material but how many films that do well in the theaters really are? As long as you know ahead of time that you will be seeing a ""B"" movie with some ""A"" list stars out in the woods doing some male bonding you'll love it. Remember this was made in the 80's before Kevin Bacon really hit it big and when Sean Astin was a hot commoditiy among teen and pre teen girls like me. It also stars ""Boner"" from the tv show ""Growing Pains"" and the assistant director is Kevin Renolds who went on to direct ""Robin Hood Prince of Thieves"" and other blockbusters. With a better script and some marketing this could have been an 80's hit. The scenery is breathtaking, the action harrowing at times, the soundtrack rocks with Bruce Hornsby, Journey and others. It really makes you want to go camping, breath in the fresh air and enjoy God's beautiful creation. If you were a child of the 80's and haven't seen this flick get it ASAP."
3,Excellent Study of Male Bonding,"This is a movie for anyone who remembers the bonds formed with friends, when a camping trip ""goes wrong."" It is a story of male bonding, and how boys can discover hidden strengths when confronted by adversity. Forget the absurdity of carrying a canoe on a backpacking trip in the mountains (an addition, not in the original script.) The story is in the relationships, and how they develop."
4,80's Reveisited,"I purchased this movie from Amazon.com because you cannot find it in stores anywhere. The scenery in the movie is fantastic, and I also like the eighties soundtrack, having grown up in the 1980's. All the actors in the movie were great. Kevin Bacon does a good job in the movie as the unlikable, Camp Guide, and it was ironic that the kid he persecuted the mostwas the one who had to help him. Ir you like the outdoors, music from the 1980's you will love this film."
5,Sectional sofa,"Read the previous review , everything she said was right pillows are not attached which I like, fabric is nice and soft love the fact that it is American made. I wanted a sectional that had a center that was curved so that it wasn't a waste for seating space, size and color perfect. Love it!"
5,Do you know what you have in Christ?,"Is your focus on Christian service (law) or Jesus Christ (grace)? Dr. McVey writes in everyday and down to earth language with examples of how to ""Say Goodby to Mr. Law,"" how about ""Knowing God's Will,"" or ""Living for Jesus."" These are just a few of the chapter titles. All of Dr. McVey's explanations are backed with carefully thought out examples and scripture. ""A Smiling God,"" Chapter 8 was the turning point for me. On page 147, ""Grace is the voice of God saying 'I will bless you until your behavior does improve!' When grace rules a man wants to live a consistently godly life style."" On page 200, Galatians 5:1, ""'It was for freedom that Christ set us free; therefore keep standing firm and do not be subject again to a yoke of slavery.' The battle is over and you won because of Jesus."" This is a book about hope and joy and Yes, GRACE."
5,GRACE RULES,"Once again Steve McVey has broadened our understanding of Grace. In Grace Rules McVey shows us how to not only to live in Grace but how our lives will be different when Grace Rules in all areas of our lives. Like Grace Walk and Grace Amazing, McVey just gives us more indepth understanding of God's Awesome Grace. I highly recommend this book along with Grace Amazing and Grace Walk. McVey has hit the target again in helping us understand God's Grace. Grace Rules is a must read."
2,Oooey Gooey Christianity,"This book is so syrupy that I could barely get through the whole thing. I did finish it because I kept hoping for some ""meat"" eventually to turn up, but it never did. The basic message was that one can do whatever he or she wants as long as they have christ in their heart because of The Savior's ""grace"". This kind of commercialized christianity makes me sick because it gives people the false impression that they do not have to be obedient to what the Heavenly Father has set forth in the Scriptures. If one truly abides in HIM, they will not subscribe to living and doing whatever they want, but rather will try to please HIM in a loving, fulfilling relationship acknowledging that HE is our Creator and Savior, and while yes, HE has granted us much grace, and yes, we will fall short, we are not given carte blanche to behave however we wish."
5,Worth reading more than once,Steve McVey presents the meaning of complete surrender. How to allow the Holy Spirit to express The LORDS will through us. Doing our thing in the flesh is worthless to God.
5,Great book!,"Bothered by ""Christian"" rules? This book is a great clarification of what God's Grace is all about. You will benefit as I have."
1,Don't Read,When there is so much about grace that makes it great we do not need to add the misinformation given in this book. If you want a biblical view if grace please move on.This book is false teaching by a false profit. It got 0 stars because you had to choose 1.
3,atleast the live show is still fun,"This album lacks something, I don't know... defiently not their best. ""Veritas Aquitas"" pretty much owns this album itself, lol, not knocking the band or anything, they are defiently one of the better groups in a genre that concists of imitators and what not."
3,....,"First, if yer a fan of older Darkest Hour (pre-Undoing Ruin) than this album is not for you. But if you are a fan of Undoing Ruin then I am sure you will love this.. this... garbage.I feel as though this album is so watered down and boring compared to any of their other material. The biggest change someone will notice is J. Henry's vocals. He is using more clean vocals like he did on a few tracks on Undoing Ruin. my only problem with this is that it sounds like the singer of Sum 41, and that's very bad.The solos have improved while the actual guitar work itself is boring and nothing too exciting.Best tracks: An Ethereal Drain, Stand And Receive Your Judgement, Deliver Us.Don't throw away yer money, just download the album.For new fans who have only heard Demons and were like ""zomgzzz soo br00tal!!!11!!11"" dont waste yer time. Go pick up Mark of The Judas and Hidden Hands Of A Sadist Nation instead."
2,complete waste of time,"being fans of the genre this film claims to be part of (post-apocalyptic), and having no reviews to help us decide, we chose to take a chance on this film.For the next person in our position, we wanted to provide some insight.First they don't make any secret that this is a SHORT film, about 14 minutes I think it was. So don't feel cheated if you were hoping for a feature-length film, it isn't.We watched the story and again with the commentary. It seems to me they spend all their time bragging about how the film was shot without any resources, time, or effort. It shows. They don't mention it, but they also appear not to have a script, a vision for what story they wanted to tell, or talent.I'm not sorry I spent the money, because now I know I wasn't missing anything before I knew what was on this DVD."
1,A Huge Disappointment,"This purchase was a HUGE disappointment. Don't bother wasting your money buying it. I had high hopes for this item when I purchased it, but it turned out just to be a meditation CD basically with the author talking through it. Big disappointment considering the other items the author has produced."
3,Solar Lantern,"I only like the amber light it gives off, but it does not last long each night no matter how much sunlight it is exposed to during the day. Some nights they do not even burn although they were exposed to plenty of sunlight and were recently purchased. I do not recommend them to anyone and wish I had returned mine. The plastic housing look cheap compared to others I bought last year. Those are out of stock, but still work very well."
2,Kind of useless,"I've had this meter for about 2 years now and still haven't found a use for it.A real DMM (or even one of those Nano o'scopes) is much better at just about everything this one does.Also, the grounding clip on this is too small, and it has too many accessories (ironic, since it doesn't seem to have much utility in any event)."
1,Self-Published Hysteria and Hyperbole,"Seems like the goal of this obviously self-published work is to scare you into using the Lodmell's asset protection services by talking at great length about the ligitation problem in America (in case you somehow missed it).The problem is that the Lodmell's don't seem to have any solutions other than the ordinary family limited partnership stuff that thousands of lawyers do anyway. The descriptions of techniques in here are readily found all over the internet; really, what was so disappointing is that in all of those pages there wasn't a single new idea. So, save your money."
4,"overall, a pretty good beginning","If we leave out the introduction, there are 9 essays in this book that attempts to discuss female-female relationships from Bronze Age Greece through Late Antiquity in Egypt. Of these 9, three are outstanding works of scholarly deduction and clear writing; another two are very good though they wander a bit or lack a clearly defined conclusion. The topics covered include visual representations on a variety of mediums, writing from women, drama and satire, and finally religious connections between ""correct behavior"" and control. This is not a book for anyone with a casual interest in gender and sexuality in antiquity -- the more you already know, the better your own Greek and Latin (at least), the more good you'll get from these studies."
3,If you leave me now,"I like only one song, If you leave me now. But this song is very special for me. Peter has most beautiful clear voice on the earth. Don't you think ?"
3,Great Precurser to the Compilation Era of the 1990's,"Columbia attempted to cash in on Chicago's runaway success in the mid-80's circa ""Chicago 17"". Another swell collection."
1,Not The Critic's Choice,"A hits album hastily thrown together. A poor cover design and peculiar song selection. Even at a budget price, this is not worth it. Stick to the more mainstream anthologies."
4,Recorded in Extended Play Mode,Another great Family Home Entertainment video for children. It teaches lessons about pride and sharing credit with others. The voice and songs of Bobby Goldsboro.Unfortunately this tape is made in Extended Play and may not work well on newer inexpensive VHS recorders. I copied it to DVD so the grand daughter could play it as often as she likes when she comes to visit. (We have a high quality 1984 Pioneer VHS tape recorder that ignores Macrovision.)
4,leaky tank but good service from Bissell,"I recently purchased this model and used it to clean the wall to wall in my house. It did the job well but I discovered the ""tank in tank"" system was leaking. The dirty waste water mixed with the cleaning solution. I called Bissell and they are shipping a replacement tank free. The cost of a cleaning service to come to my house and clean 2 rooms cost more than the reconditioned Bissell price!"
1,reconditioned? used and uninspected is more like it!,"I bought this product because I've had decent experiences with reconditioned products in the past. However, Bissel does not seem to do even a cursory inspection of its reconditioned products. The product I received not only looked used, but was also defective: the water container had a leak in it. If they had actually tested this product they would've caught this defect right away. To me, it means that when Bissel receives a return it simply repackages it and sells it again as ""reconditioned"" without testing or fixing it. Maybe their non-reconditioned product is good; stay away from this one, though."
4,Great deal & works well!,I was amazed at how well this cleaned our disgusting stained carpet in the house we just bought!
3,A Nice Souvenir,"If you visit the theatre and take the tour, this book will contain only a little more information than the English Language tour provides. It does contain glorious photographs which are not permitted during the tour; however, it does not contain photos of any of the basements - which would have been nice.The book contains both Spanish and English Text."
3,An eerie history lesson for young and old alike,Phantoms of the Plains takes a look at Texas hauntings as well as it's history. Ms. Williams starts each story with an overview of the land and it's people.This is a great book for teens or anyone who wants to know more about the ledgends and eerie going ons here in Texas.
4,A Nice collection of the mysterious happenings of West TX,"This book is an interesting collection of mysteries of west Texas, some well known, such as the Marfa Lights, and others not as well known. There are a variety of haunted houses, hotels, schools etc mentioned as well as old forts, scenes of murders, ambushes and the like. This is a wonderful book for reading on a stormy night, or as a source for campfire stories."
3,live from the underground pens,"I bought this CD from the artist personally, who was in Times Square (NYC) hustling to get his name out. He explained that he doesn't rap about guns and drugs, and indeed his topics are refreshing and down to earth. I think he has a lot of potential but, sadly, corporate America (and indeed the mindless masses as well) seems mainly interested in shallow, talentless garbage like Tony Yayo, Ying Yang Twins, etc. Luckily, though, the pendulum usually swings back in the other direction, which means that before long there will be a return to the essence of what quality hip hop is suppossed to be."
4,Perfect!,"We moved into a condo and in our room we needed a triple toggle switch plate.Many places you go only have single or double. We found the perfect one! It added a lot to our room so we could remove the old white one.What I like also, there were designs to pick from also."
2,Doesn't work on its own.,"I use this product under my eyes to lessen the dark circles. However, by itself, I don't see a difference. I still have to use the secret concealer for any type of coverage/lightening of the eye area. Also, the packaging for this product is very bad. It's hard to get the right amount needed and I end up wasting quite a bit."
4,"innovative product, not for covering up discoloration","i got snookered into buying this and the matching super secret super brightening power at a neimans one day when i was weak and tired. the powder is awesome, but very messy, by the way (moderately super). this brightener is interesting, it has a halo effect, and is at its most effective when coupled with the matching powder. but it does not do any covering up; no concealing of any kind here. i used up my pen in an astonishingly short period of time, which sort of irritated me, but i learned how to use brighteners i the course of owning it, which was a new technique to me. if you need color under your eyes in addition to brightening (which i sometimes do), you can easily replace this product with benefit's ooh la la lift."
2,Not as pictured,"A friend of mine has this game, so I already knew I loved it when I added it to my wish list. My sister saw it on my wish list and bought it for me. Cool, right? Yay Amazon.Well, unfortunately, it's not as pictured. My friend has the version that's pictured: a solid black base made of wood, aluminum dividers, birch squares and actual marble playing pieces. It's a pleasure to handle all of the pieces and parts.The game I received is all plastic, as shown here:[...]The four rotating square sections are mechanically connected to the base, and the mechanism sticks, which is annoying.Honestly, I find the lower-quality ""toy"" aspect displeasing and will probably not play Pentago very much as a result. I'm disappointed that the high-quality item I wished for (and that my sister paid for) is not what I received."
1,We know already,"How many times is this clown gone say his name and phone number?! It was cool the first thousand times, but now its just ridiculous. I'm about to put this cd on ebay for a penny. The chopped and screwed version is ok though. Work on them lyrics homie. Holla at ya boy. Memphis born and raised. Don't buy this album unless you are a retard and need to be told who mike jones is over a hundred times."
1,Joker has no idea,"The reviewer below me with the title of joker is a total moron. Just because you don't enjoy rap music has no right for you to write a review and condemn everyone that listens to it. This review for this cd is for people that have boughten the cd and would like to inform people on how they liked it. Not for people like you to tell them how dumb they are for listening to a genre of music. The bands that are ""struggling"" are struggling because they don't make good music. If they made good music then people would buy their cds and therefore they would be struggling no more. So to you I say go review your preshish pink floyd cd and leave this one alone since you probably have never listened to it.P.S- I really do not like this cd."
2,((Dang Homie Stop Repeating Ya Name It's Annoying!! Well Its RenagadeZ!),"Ayo Whutdadrillz Yeah Yeah Its Me Once Again No One Betta!! Aiight I Admit I Cop All Of Tha Hottest Wunz And This Was Not On My List Fo A While And Yeah Still Tippin Is Hot But That Was $lim Thug's Joint!! Im Not Feeling This Cd! It's Annoyin LoL But He's Gotta Make Sum $$$ Some How I Wish SomeWhurr Else But Hey I Cant HAte Tha Man And You Should Know His Name By Now.. LoL Mike Jones, Mike Jones, Dang SHut Ya Mouff. Well You Should Cop It For Still Tippin And A Couple Of Joints.(((((HERES MY TOP FAV JOINTS))))))))Still Tippin'Flossin'Screw ThatTurning Lane...What Ya Know AboutWHISPAH BAKK AT CHA GURL!!"
1,truthfully,"this guy sucks, ok. his rhymes are garbage, his habit of constanly repeating tha same line ova n ova again is annoying, as well as his habit of repeating his name n numba. so i give u this advice... mike jones is an embarrasment 2 rap, n there are much betta artists from tha souf. ""People's Champ"" by paul wall is comin september 13th. ""Sound of Revenge"" by Chamillionaire is comin october 4th, n if ya cant wait til then he has ""Mixtape Messiah"" n ""Man On Fire"" mixtapes out. Honestly i feel that Chamillionaire is tha best artist in Houston so i'd buy one of his rather than this crap.utha southern rappers 2 pay attention 2 are Slim Thug, Killa Kyleon, T.I, David Banner, Lil Flip, Lil Scrappy, Z-Ro, n sweet James Jones aka Pimp C. U ALREADY KNO"
2,Who?,"Maybe he has very short term memory loss, maybe he doesn't want us to forget his name. The audio production and the fact you can't give it 0 stars saves this album from that fate. Quite possibly the worst Houston Has To Offer, seeing as his DJ Paul Wall Flows better and mike jones, who? has the worst verse and performance on still tippin'. I'm still tRippin over the fact i'm the only man in america without a record deal, what do they have contracts on the back of cereal boxes, some gold teeth underneath the lucky charms, with a few cliche temp tattoos, in there too?"
1,whats his name?,This moron actually thinks hes gonna sell more cds by saying his name over and over again? what is with this half assed attempt to be famous this guy is a joke his flow and styles are weak. want my advice stay away from this crap.
1,Dyke Jones,"This Cd is the worst cd to come out of texas and i know cuz im from texas. Nobody in texas is feeling Dyke jones, For people who dont know Chamillionaire ripped dyke jones on his last mixtape the ""Mixtape Messiah"" if you dont have that mixtape go get it. Dyke jones cant rap, he repeats his lyrics, he's not lyrical, He doesnt rep for Texas like he suppose to. Overall this cd is horrible and the only song i like on here is ""Still tippin"" Because of Slim Thug the Boss and Paul wall. Dont get this album cuz i dont recommend it."
1,"Monkey ""music""","rap is music for morons that dont know how to play instruments plain & simple...Mike jones"" who is mike jones"" is plain garbage atleast learn how to rap before doing it. If you like this ? changes are you'll enjoy fat joe nelly and all those radio frindley f*ggots. Want good rap? listing to necro,goretex & kill bill and support the undeground hip-hop scene not this mainstream bullsh*t."
2,"I'm Mike Jones, I'm Mike Jones, I'm Mike Jones, I'm Mike Jones,","No, I'm not mike jones, but that's about what the album sounds like.Never in history has a rapper mumbled this much, and he talks about the same bland and stupid topics adressed in EVERY SINGLE MOTHER F**KING RAP ALBUM SINCE 1994!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm starting to think maybe these rock fans are right. Maybe rap really is mindless garbage. I mean I'm not counting the good rappers, like Nas, 2pac, Outkast, etc. But, I AM talking about dumb ones like Lil' Jon, and all the other ones with ""Lil'"" in their name. They all suck c*ck. Next thing you know he'll be calling himself Lil Mike. Ha ha, can't wait to see that happen...."
2,This album is weak,"Mike jones repeats himself to much and says his name to much. No one cares about your ice and your cars, dont u got anythin else to say. He is a disappointment to Houston. The only reason i gave it 2 stars is because i like that song with Big Moe"
2,Annoying,"He does have a good song, ""still tippin"". But after that, all he raps about is how he got he major record deal. And he say his name in every song, about 5 or 6 times! And he says his telephone number about 2 times every song! (Which if you call it, dosen't even work. And when they say a line in the song they repeat it sevral times. So my advice, is not to get this CD! It's not really that good, at all! I hated it!"
2,One of the Oddest CD's of 2005,"I try to give every artist a honest listen, but Mike Jones, cares more about self promotion than rapping. Repeating the same line constantly, shows lyrical layziness. Now, let me be honest that Still Tipping is a BANGER!!(mainly because of Slim Thug), but a banger none the less. Mike we know who you are now. So get back in the studio, and do the damn thing...."
3,Who?????? Mike Jones,"If you don't know his name already, then you are probably deaf. The cd is straight except for he says his name to damn much. He acts as if you have a bad memory or something. But other than the name calling, its a pretty decent album. would have gave it four stars except the name calling messed him up."
1,"What, I can't give it ZERO stars?!?","This cd sucked. I threw it out my window after one spin. It's ignorant southern trash. Luda brings style. Outkast is the sht. Banner is smart and brings the thunder. 8Ball and MJG are tight. Young Buck shts all over this crap.Q. Who is Mike Jones?A. Unfortunately a rich pathetic marketing hype created ""rapper"" that is already making his next cd, which will sell like 2000 copies after this disaster of a, dare I say it, album?!?!DONT BUY THIS GARBAGE, buying this BS makes them think they can make more of it, Mike Jones as a rapper is worse than a preschooler sucking his thumb."
1,Poprap,"Being from Houston TX, I never really like alot of southern music unless it was like scarface or the getoboys...The south may be popular now because it's a easy way to recongnize just get some wack club beats and talk about clubbing or ice you got a hit...It's a easy sound to get like junior high kids to lsitened to what happened to the gutter rap about hustling and gangbanging and what happened to actually good production like rap from the 90's...The g funk beats need to come back street talk needs to back when rap was about pushing the boundries not being a bunch pussy like 90% of rappers are nowday's...And for the record 50 cent not a gnagters rapper he makes trl songs for 13 year girls and boys well g rappers dont do that(candyshop) that;s hardcore please...He might been shot 9 times but he doesnt rap like hood rapper...."
1,i would of gave it o stars,who sigh mike jones in the first place his music is garbage nothing but nosie and sound a horrible sound this should not be considermusic and he can't rap and he saids his name over and over aginno one cares about his name hes lame
1,ummmm who?,"literaly who? does mike jones think he is? hes a bad rapper but a good promoter though. If your looking for real houston, texas rap stick to the geto boyz or at least chamillionaire.PEEEEEEAAAAAAAAACEEEEEEE"
1,who is mike jones? i could care less......,a little breif history bout mike jones.......back then nobody wantyed mike jones now hes got an album out and nothing changed no1 still wants u
2,Chamillionaire is betta,"i aint even gotta put up a whole paragraph tellin people why chammilionaire is betta, just listen to some of chams music first."
1,porque?,"yo i cant believe this, is hiphop is dead ?cuz come on its about flo n nusery rhyme lyrics look as a fan have the right 2 criticize b cuz 15 for cd thats not wrth it ok , i can comend mike jones for his and getting paid i will give em thatt i can destroy him freestyln lotta cats can,so if u a tru hip hop fan buy at your own risk n i know jigga didnt give him a shout out cmon quit lying"
1,Horrible,"The only people loving this disc, are either from Texas, or know nothing about hip-hop. I heard still tippin' and couldnt wait for this disc. I got it last week and it SUX!! Other than still tipin' this disc horrible...take it from a true hip-hop fan, dont waste your money on this disc like i did....hopefully Paul Wall will come thru....werd."
2,"Who is Mike Jones!!.. a piece of crap, thats who.","I nearly threw up after listening to this garbage. After hearing him repeat his name for so many times I swear I felt dizzy. Repeating your name so many times wont make me buy your album Mike. His rap flow is weak and his ridiculous repetition of his name isnt necessary. Back then is pretty cool but the chorus is lame. ohh and not to mention when he opens his mouth every single time to show us his bling. Every other rapper has a gold grill in there trap,you aint the only one, its not impressing. Get some lypo instead.. it will do u better. Someone give me some Haterade, quick! I just hated a whole lot."
1,Sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If I could give this clown 0 stars, I would. Him and the rest of those sweetnerhouse fools give Texas a bad name. Scarface is probably pissed by now. Even lil Flip's no talent having self must be mad at this. Listening to the rants and raves on the CD is like the sound a person hears when sitting in a car with holes in the muffler! Mike Joooonnnnes!!! As a matter of fact, I rather poke holes in my muffler and listen to it! [...]"
1,Are You Serious..???,"first off....man...This guy is WAAAAAACK..How could someone so wack be so famous.?? His voice is annoying, his phone number is annoying and this album plain out SUCKS...DONT WASTE UR MONEY...trust me!!!"
1,no talent,this cd is garbage. this is some of thie worst rapping i've ever heard. don't waste your money
2,Who? I don't wanna know,"Everyone knows hip hop is firstly about the lyrics and on that side Mike Jones is straight rubbish: He constantly repeats the same few lines over and over again, there is nothing lyrically new or innovative on this cd and Mike is constantly outshone by his guests especially Paul Wall and Slim Thug. Some of the beats are real tight especially ""Still Tippin"". For true hip hop heads this is definitely one to avoid simply because there are so many more talented rappers in the south right now."
1,Mike jones worst rapper alive? yes he is,"Mike Jones is just like young Jeezy terrbile, Mike Jones constantley says his name a million times and his phone number, which is pretty stupid,,,, Mike Jones basically cant rap and he is definatley the worst in Swisha House...... only good song on this cd was Still Tippin but only because Slim Thug was on it and Paul Wall did a ok job on it too......."
2,yeah i messed around and bought this mess,"i wanted to like it. the dude seemed to have potential. i really didn't like the single but i had heard some underground stuff that sounded pretty good but this album is horrible. i really got baited in by his new single ""back then"". that's a hot joint but that's about it in my opinion. i knew lyrically he wasn't that great but he could have least came with hot beats. i would call him and tell him it's garbage but he probably would just call me a hater.this cd is so bad i really don't plan on buying anymore. bootlegging is back in effect for me."
1,This Crap is so wack its ridiculous!!!!!,Yo this crap is so trash its ridiculous!!! This idiot can't rap he repeats himself over and over who really wants to here a person brag on some things that he doesnt have...This is a worthless rapper talking about nothing.......The ablum sucks and I said that I am from Houston TX.....YO MAN WHOEVER BOUT THIS WACK ASS ALBUM IS AN IDIOT AND THEY DONT HAVE NO TYPE OF INTELLEGENCE BECAUSE THIS RAPPER DOESNT TALK ABOUT ANYTHING....THIS AINT NO HUSTLER NOR A RAPPER NOR A BUSINESS MAN IF THATS THE CASE ANYBODY CAN BE A RAPPER.......
2,Leave this out with your other trash on saturday morning,"This SH$% is garbage. Who is mike jones? well u'll kno by the third song all about him. His ringtones his, telephone number, and the name for his album. Im from Houston and its hard defending trash ass rappers like Mike Jones, when there is real talent coming from Houston. If yall want to hear some class and real rap from houston, go pick up Z-ro. It really doesn't matter which one because all of his albums are classics but ""let the truth be told"" is definitely something special. (...) ! Holla"
2,I know who U R,i understand that originally him saying his name was part of his way of promoting himself. i like his style of rap he has some decent skillz. truly a tx hardhitter not as tight and hard as his counterpart current beef King Koppa The Chamillion. I get tired of hearing MIKE JONES MIKE JONES MIKE JONES MIKE JONES MIKE JONES it takes away from some of the good production work and vocal skillz dont get me wrong if da shyyyt is sellin roll wit it 2 the wheelz fall off PLAYADA TIREZ GOING FLAT ON YOUR RUN FLATZ IF U DON'T FIND SOMETHING ELSE 4 ME PLAYA
1,One of the worst gimmicks I've ever seen,"This is by far one of the worst albums of the year. ""Still Tippin"" is the only good song on here. Everything else is just trash start to finish. The Dirty South has some good music but this is just an example of everything that is wrong with that scene today. Other than Slim Thug, Swishahouse is a talentless geek show from start to finish. Chamillionaire should be happy he's now longer affiliated with those clowns. Avoid this and that dreadful Paul Wall CD as well. Go get The Sound of Revenge for good H-Town rap."
1,I want my $15 Dollars back!!!!!,"Amazon, you guys need to make a 0 star option, because this album really deserves one. I'm gonna make this brief....MIKE JONES IS WAAACK!!! This has to be the biggest disappointment in HIP HOP HISTORY!! Man, where do I begin? MIKE JONES says his name 10 billion times. That don't make no sense what-so-ever! That ain't hip hop!I can't believe yall down in Houston like this dude!! The beats are HELLA WACK!! I'm sorry, but I can't be bumping this cd in my car with those LAME lyrics and beats. After I heard ""Still Tippin"" I had to waste my money and get the CD, because I thought it was going to be off the chain. Now I want to beat this cd WITH a chain. Nuff Said. Mike should change his number to 1-900-WIGGIDY-WIGGIDY-WACK (Kris Kross)"
2,3 years waitin for dis crap,"I waited 3 years for this album.3 YEARS!!! I been hearin da same stuff all the time.Who Is Mike Jones comin soon.WHO? Mike Jones Who? Mike Jones.I been hearin da same stuff for 3 years.The cd finally comes out.And I hear the same stuff.Most of the stuff he talks about,I have heard before.Nothin new at all.And if he keeps sayin his name,i will choke him.For the people who dont know Mike Jones,dont get this cd.All you gotta do is listen to some of his mixtapes like ballin underground or king of the streets.its basically the same stuff.Crap"
1,281-330-8004 Call him & cuss him out!!!,"I don't know this phone number because I have called him, but because he says it, I don't know, about 500 times!!! Who is Mike Jones? Another terrible rapper that needs to repeat himself four times to fill out 16 bars of a track. I gotta give him credit, his marketing is tight! Every person I know whose name is ""Jones"", I have to say their name like that, because it's permanently stuck in my brain. Seriously, I bought the CD because of ""Still Tippin'"" and it was one of the worst things I could have ever done. This CD is so terrible I wouldn't insult my friends by giving it to them. We should've saw it coming though. I mean ""Still Tippin'"" is only tight because of Slim Thug and Paul Wall, not Mike Jones, who? Mike Jones.If you want real rap look elsewhere. If you want garbage, either teach your dog to rap, or buy this CD."
4,"281-330-8004 Hit Mike Jones Up On The Low, Mike Jones Bout To Blow","The album is nice. I liked the screwed version better. The beats are tight and he had the right people on the album. His lyrics were alright but still needs work. Other than that, cop it for the club nights and bang it hard because thats what it is. Look out Slim Thug's album, Already Platinum. It drops on the 12th of this month. It is going to be way better than this. I Already know. Ya feel me. Its Beezly folk!"
3,What you know about that Lone Star State?,This album is ok and could have been better if some better beats were put down. I wanted dig in some these ole hoes bicthes that ain't feeling the south and the screwed up sound.If you down one love. Scarface ain't the only one that done put it down for the south. All these south players gettin picked up by major labal so EAT ONE.I can't even listen to nothing from the from the east cuz most of it sound the same Back to the album I wish swisha house could get over they issue's and would drop some track it would have cracked. I think Jones 2nd album will be better
3,Cruisin' Music,"He's not the best rapper, but he doesn't have to be. I listen to everything from hip-hop to classical and have learned a lot from and about music the past few years. Mike Jones makes up for his lyrical shortcomings with an entertaining flow and style. Beats are very solid too and definatly have that H-town flavor. Cd is just about what I expected, a solid B. Great music to cruise around to. I think most album's are overrated by the customers. Just because a cd isn't a four or five star album doesn't mean it sucks. Some music is just meant to be fun and that's exactly what Mike Jones brings. I for one am happy with my purchase and the screwed and chopped version is an added bonus worth ten bucks on it's own. I'm out."
2,Pretty bad,"After I heard ""Still Tippin'"" and ""Back Then"", I was expectin a good album. Got a free burned copy from my friend, put it in the stereo, and realized they were the ONLY good 1's on the CD. The rest ranged from mediocre to horribly. ""Grandma"" was a nice idea, but it creeps the s### outta me. He talks about kissin her and huggin her, but he makes it sound like she's his boo. That's sick. Neway, DON'T get tricked into buyin this crap. If u want good H-Town rap, cop Chamillionare's new album."
3,Back then mike jones was hot!,"This is a below average cd on the part of mike jones. All those who knew of mike jones ""back then"" would agree. Mike has the potential to be so much better. Alot of the songs have been around for a while. I have had still tippin for 2 years now."
3,Waited over 3 years to hear Who Mike Jones again and again!,Who.........Mike Jones! If I hear that one more time I might scream. this album was not worth the 3 year wait. For those who are Texas natives such as myself know that Mike could have came better than this. It seems that most of what I heard on the album I've heard from him before on other Swisha House mix tapes. I thought we would have got to get better. I'm not hating cause marketing to the rest of the world this guy is fresh but for all my Texans yall know the deal this was not a great album!
3,"""Mike Jones: 281-330-8004""","Who is Mike Jones is a slightly above average CD with several good tracks and two monster hits.The best tracks are the albums top two singles: ""Still Tippin"" and ""Back then"". Other notables include: ""Flossin"", ""Type of N**ga U Need"", ""Grandma"", and ""5 years from now"".What prevents this album from really suceeding is it's lack of originality and Mike's constant reciting of his name and cell phone number -- throw in the fact that most of the albums hooks are below average and you have an OK album that is better than most, but not one of the best. Don't expect this album to overwhelm you with style or originality."
3,Stop,"I ain't hatin on Mike Jones, but neither him Slim Thug or Paul Wall put Houston on the map. Has everyone forgotten about UGK, Lil' Flip, Scarface & The Geto Boys?? No hate to them Swisha House boys, but they didn't originate this movement."
1,are u guys serious?,he promoted a CD for 3 years.........and its horrbleits got old songs on theirstil tipping? wow 1 year old...and thats not really his song its slim thugs...sowed up is a remix of the old sowed up with the same lyrics but differnt instrumetal...type of nikka u need...is ice age...and the rest just blows.... come one now guys...u paid for an album that has songs that u paid for b4 this Cd came out
1,Mike Jones and Lil Jon should team up....,"I mean seriously, the guy can't rap so why not try to save himself with some humor, just think about it...I'm Mike Jones, What? I'm Mike Jones, What? I'm Mike Jones, What?Excuse me? I'm Mike Jones, What? I'm Mike Jones, OKAAAAY.by the way, in case you don't know what the hell he's saying in that song all over the radio, the lyrics go like this:Back then, they didn't want me, now I'm hot, hoes all on me...Apparently he likes us to go to great lengths to figure out what he says which is why he makes his voice sound like a guy in prison named Mama......"
3,die hard fans only,"i prefer cham to mike jones but have to admit some of jones' songs are likable (still tippin/back then) i think that the guest apperances and beats make this album ok, though mike jones consistant repeating of the same line/his name gets annoying to the point where after 1 or two songs that aint still tippin or back then i turn it off. if you love him buy it if you think hes aiiight dont buy it i wish i hadnt."
1,Who Mike Jones? Who Cares?,"Mike Jones isn't anything different. Still Tippin is talking about what every other rapper has already covered. Who cares if your ""tippin"" on 4 4s? All the other songs are just basic rap songs with no real meaning. Also, how many times does this guy need to say his name or give out his phone number?"
1,I wish I could give negative stars,"I've never written a review, but I just wanted to let you know if you buy this album you are a complete idiot, and you're killing Hip-Hop. Stop killing my music!"
1,Mike Jones is Crap,Is this a joke? I was forced to listen to this by someone who was giving me a ride. You can't help but feel sorry for people who make and endorse crappy (mainstream) music like this because they are so obviously clueless.
1,Mike Jones! Mike Jones! I'm a reteard! Mike Jones!,"It's pathetic that this can pass a rap. All this dick does is repeat his name like he has a speech empedimate. The first time I heard this, I thought Dave Chappel was making fun of someone! If your really in to rap, get 2pac.HIP HOP SUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Joker.,"Somehow this guy has a platinum album...who can ya blame? MTV!!!!!!! The route of all evil!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Rappers are just a bunch of crack addicted retards who are crushed whentheir albums don't go multi-platinum and go on a killing rampagewhen they don't win album of the year. They also convince 10-year-old kids that it's okay to join gangs and smoke pot and sexually harrass women and kill people...EVERYTHING MTV STANDS FOR!!! It's just so sad that whenever a rapper releases a new album, it'll go multi-platinum when there are millions of hardworking, struggling bands that will never get respect because they don't play on MTV and most kids will therefore think are bad 'cause they don't get played on MTV. Say no to this crap, Buy a Pink Floyd album instead."

1,Awfully cheap & extremely small,"I brought this as a Christmas present for my daughter. I didn't want to buy one from the local retailer b/c the strings were always flimsy and customers and kids have played with it in the store. Avoiding all of this I came to amazon in hopes of getting one that had better craftsmanship and quality. After opening it, I found that it had neither. Avoid purchasign it you will be disappointing. My daughter is 7 yrs old. This guitar looks like a banjo. If it wasn't because it was a 'Santa' present, I would have sent it back. Please consider this review before purchasing."
1,Mildew smelly. Strings don't all work.,Do not recommend this for anyone. The case came covered in mildew and had to be cleaned over night. The strings do not hold their tightness at all. Cute guitar if you just want to mount it on a wall. Not worth more than $2.00
2,Not solid,I bought this guitar for my 3yr old. I am disappointed that I wasted almost $35 (including s&h) the strings are hard to tighten and then it breaks easily. They put extra strings but it really doesnt work. I will rather buy a better guitar. I dont recommend this guitar.
1,do NOT waste your money,"I bought this as a present for my nephew. We were VERY disapointed. The finish was bumpy, had nicks in it. Very cheaply made. This belongs in a dollar store."
1,Total Garbage,"Bought this Guitar for my 6 year old Granddaughter. My son tried to reach at least a partial tuning. Strings continued to break. When I tried to return it, Austin Bazaar went into annoyance mode giving me 5 days to photograph the problem and send it to them so their product review section could ascertain whether or not it was legitimate. I simply threw it in the garbage and went to a music store where we were treated right and got her a guitar that she is enjoying."
1,Beware- Not a Quality Product,"My toddler received this as a holiday gift and it has been a huge disappointment. The strings are not tight enough to strum, and there is no means to adjust them properly. We took it to a guitar center to see if they could improve the situation, and they said it would cost $50 to replace all of the fittings to make it usable. I would not recommend this to anyone."
1,Just a toy,"The price of the guitar was cheap and that is exactly what you get for the price. The guitar isn't made well and it's very hard to tune to the correct sounds. I bough this for my daughter because she wanted to play guitar with me and her being so young I didn't want to buy her an expensive one yet. This is just for show, not real acoustic sound will come out of it."
3,okay,It was okay I thought it might be a little fancier than I thought. Next time I will be an electric guitar because this was just a little too simple.
4,"Perfect, but it will have to do....","I've been using Adobe PhotoDeluxe 2.0 for years. I've tried other photo editing programs, but I keep coming back to this one. It is so simple to use, and so versatile! I love the special effects buttons, and the ""one-click"" ability to convert photos from color to black-and-white.The ONLY problem I have had is if I try to open it in Windows XP (Service Pack 3) after I have been running other programs, it freezes and never opens. If I make sure it's the first program I open after booting up my computer, I have no problems with it.I will be DESOLATED if the day ever comes when I can't use this program anymore!"
1,Not compatible with OS9!,"Please. If you have Mac OS9 beware! My Mac freezes every time I try to use this software and I have spent hours trying to resolve the problem. Be sure to review the user group entries on Adobe's website before buying this software! You will find many frustrated OS9 users and no solutions. GOTO ...(their website). Enter search and enter ""PhotoDeluxe OS9."""
2,Troublesome,"I have found PhotoDeluxe to be very cumbersome. Many of the features are hard to use if you're a novice. PhotoDeluxe for Dummies was helpful and explained quite a bit but why should you have to spend money on a guidebook? Also, changing the print setup leads to constant crashing (Windows 98). I have plenty of free disk space and available RAM so I don't think this is the reason. I'd say spend a bit more for a BMW and stay away from this Chevrolet."
1,don't buy this,I purchased this product and when I tried to install it an error message came up saying that it couldn't load it because the classic environment is not supported I'm using a MAC that meets all the requires listed by the product so I now have to return the item and start all fresh. I recommend buying software directly from MAC so this won't happen to you.
5,Really cute game,"I've been playing this game online for years, I think it's very fun and entertaining. I was looking for a game for my parents for Christmas and this fits the bill nicely. They will enjoy playing this game a lot, it's not too complicated to learn and it's just the right amount of challenge to keep them interested."
1,IRRELEVANT,"I bought this book on the recommendation somewhere of some agent, in a list of books he said every novelist should have. But I found it irrelevant. Too left-brain for me. The question about writing fiction is this: How do you make it all come together -- the story, the narrative voice, the main character in motion, some kind of meaning, realistic detail, etc. -- to create the magic that is fiction? We want to lose ourselves in an imaginary world. How do you make that happen? I didn't find the answer here."
4,The takeaway is to have others read your fiction,"The takeaway is that you need to have others read your work and you need to put away and then reread it weeks later. What emotions are you trying to touch as a writer? What thoughts? He calls this ""prelibation"" and this is important since fiction without the reader getting involved emotionally is bad fiction."
2,"Bizarre, self-indulgent book","The author spends a great deal of time listing the many flaws of his peers (sometimes abstracted into personae such as 'Senior Editor') and then proceeds to outline his crank theory of the elements of fiction. The book is not a total loss-- the ridiculously overblown prose is amusing in its own way. And there are a few useful ideas here and there. Still, given that this is the distilled wisdom of thirty years of experience, there's a certain pathos. The book is almost totally irrelevant."
5,Beautiful book,Excellent book and had just the information I was looking for including a complete chapter on my relative from the late 1800;s
4,Henry I: Yale English Monarch Series,"Learned scholars tend to have all-encompassing analysis in their books, and this book is no exception. In my opinion, the last two sections of this book are not geared for a history buff such as myself and are dry and dull material; I know that scholars feel they have to be complete in their analysis, but the difference with books geared for history enthusiasts is that these books are exciting to read, from the first to the last page, and this book falls short in this regard, but to be fair about this, I think the majority of this book is exceptional and compares with any historian in my vast collection; the law and governance section was interesting to a degree but was dry as well. This book is complete in detail and goes beyond the perspective that historians employ on their readers."
3,A quick one..the Who's second album..pretty good songs,"I'm a hardcore Who fan who owns virtually all the Who catalogueminus the last two Who studio cd's ( Face Dances and It's Hard.which in my opinion weren't worth the vinyl they were pressed on.On this outing.A quick One( Happy Jack).my only complaint is that the remaster here doesnt include Happy Jack! What was MCA/ Polydor records thinking! They did do an about face.and they included the rarer acoustic version of Happy Jack instead.Best songs.Run Run Run, Boris the Spider,Cobwebs and Strange,So Sad About Us and A Quick One While He's Away. There's several great bonus tracks included here as well..Batman, Disguises,Man with the Money and the quick version of My Generation/ Land of Hope and Glory..Rule Britannia!I wonder if.MCA/ Polydor will make a deluxe edition of this and upgrade this cd to two cd's..( as with the Who Sell Out)I bet there's more unheard of demos and rare songs that are still in Universal's vaults.Cheers mates"
4,Spotlight Review Incorrect,"The spotlight reviews state that the ""title track"" Happy Jack was removed from this title. That's only half true. The original UK album, A Quick One, didn't include Happy Jack (Singles were generally released seperately from albums over there). When the album was released in the US, the record company renamed it Happy Jack, and that song was added to the end of the album while Heatwave was dropped. Since the album here is the basically the UK version, it is somewhat misleading to state that the title track has been dropped, although I agree that given the bonus material, the inclusion of the original version of Happy Jack should have been added to this release."
3,"A mess, more or less","The Who's second album suffers from weak material. It's not just that each of the band contributed material: Roger and Keith's material is filler, pretty much, but Pete's 'Don't Look Away' and 'Run Run Run' are too. The cover of 'Heat Wave' by the Vandellas is a throwaway curiosity. Which leaves John's songs, both very strong -- the rumbling 'Boris The Spider' and the very funny 'Whiskey Man' -- and Pete's 'So Sad About Us', one of his strongest rock/ballads, and the hilarious 'A Quick One While He's Away' (a cross between the Odyssey and an Ealing comedy). It's all very dated now, and sounds like a band flailing about looking for direction. Luckily for the Who, the pop art brilliance of Sell Out and a certain deaf, dumb and blind boy lay just around the corner."
3,Only place to find A Quick One,"Now if you want every Who tune, you must get this one. Aside from""Happy Jack"" and ""A Quick One while He's Away"", the album is not that great. But if you are a die-hard fan, purchase it. By the way, the Entwhistle classic ""Boris the Spider"" is also featured here."
5,Work in progress,"This album is, I would contend, much overlooked in the Who's catalogue. Yet, 37 years on, there is a freshness and energy which many of their later albums lack. Who fans will be familiar with all the tracks on the CD but the question is do the remixes work? I say the amswer is an emphatic YES. Most tracks are in crisp, clear stereo for the first time. The original mono vinyl album always sounded a bit ""muddy"" to me, though no worse than many others from the mid 60s. The title track, in particular, sounds much better in its stereo mix. It is a pity, though, that Polydor couldn't squeeze the single mix of ""Happy Jack"" onto the CD as well as the mono acoustic version which is an interesting curio rather than an essential. My favourite track is ""Disguises"", originally from the ""Ready Steady Who"" EP...but, again, where is ""Circles""? This is the Who striding confidently along the highway that led to international acclaim...it's a great album to have in your collection."
2,no no no!!!!,"there's one big drag here: ""a quick one"" is the tepid studio version, not the terrific, rousing performance from the Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus film (you can find it on the ""Rushmore"" soundtrack--thank Wes Anderson for bringing that song back!). the acoustic ""happy jack"" is pretty good. the who are no the kinks. get pete townsend's solo albums..."
5,One Damn Good album From The Early Who,"This is a damn good album that everyone [...] on and I never understood why. It's the only album that all the members pen their own material. It was actually a step up for Pete, John, Roger & Keith to do something different. Sure Happy Jack isn't on it but so what, that doesn't make it any less of an album. It's got a lot of good cuts such as ""Whiskey Man"", ""Don't Look Away"", ""So Sad About Us"", & ""A Quick One, While He's Away"", & bonus tracks like ""Disguises"", ""I've Been Away"", & ""In The City"". I personally don't think The Who never made a bad album and I think the 60's Who is the best decade of the Who. But don't get me wrong, I love 70's Who, as well. Quadrophenia(My personal fav) , Who's Next, Who By Numbers are The Who at their greatest!"
1,Don't believe stickers claiming stereo,"I just bought a copy of A Quick One with a sticker that said it was re-mastered in stereo. It is not. It is the same mastering as originally released in 1995. The only songs in stereo are Run Run Run,I've Been Away, In the City and Man with the Money. Also Whiskey Man is in fake stereo. If you already have A Quick One, don't be fooled by claims of new stereo re-mastering."
3,ok,"It's worth having, but it seems as if The Who didn't know what kind of music they wanted to play, it's the last beatle like album."
5,Quick One The Who,"I love the Who, and this CD is just one of the best. Although, I really don't believe they made a bad album."
5,A Fine Example of How All Re-issues Should be Done!,"I was delighted (nay, ecstatic) to find this gem among the train wreck of the Who's early re-issue catalog. Let me say right off that the sound quality of this UK import is consistantly top-notch all the way through. And, as advertised, it IS almost entirely in true, authentic stereo (I suppose we can forgive the three minor songs that aren't). I purchased the 1995 US version of this CD a few years ago and was outraged to find that even though the disc said STEREO right on it, it was mostly in mono. And the sound quality, like much of the other re-issued material, was shrill and distortion-ridden in places. But this UK release does not suffer from those problems. This much-overlooked album disserves to be heard like this. ""Boris the Spider"", ""Heat Wave"", and ""So Sad About Us"" in particular have a fresh, clean sound in wonderful, wonderful stereo! Happy listening!"
2,No Happy Jack? How unhappy!,"I really can't understand how a person can't include the title track. Well not exactly the title track, but when it was first released the album in the U.S. they changed the album title from A Quick One to Happy Jack. But anyways, it's outrageous not to include the original recording of Happy Jack. It's like not including Simon and Garfunkel's Bridge Over Troubled Water on the album Bridge Over Troubled Water. It's like not including Bob Dylan's The Times They Are A-Changin' on the album The Times They Are A-Changin'. It's like not including the Beatle's Magical Mystery Tour on the album Magical Mystery Tour. I think I made my point. It's a shame. I suggest downloading the tracks that were on the original album from iTunes to make your own A Quick One/Happy Jack."
2,The Who's second stumbles,"The who havn't quite got it yet, it loses focus, and doesn't adequately expresd it's ideas. they would come back with a vengeanceon their next LP, The Who Sell Out"
3,Middling Who,"This is probably the worst Who album of their first decade, simply because the whole band was encouraged to write songs. Now, with Pete and John, that's fine: Boris the Spider, Whiskey Man, Run Run Run, So Sad About Us and the mini-opera title track all rule. But it's in the other two's songs where this falls apart: I Need You and See My Way are two of the wimpiest, most sterile Who songs ever, Cobwebs and Strange is stupid, but not in the ""stupidly fun"" sense, and their cover of Heat Wave is as bad as the two James Brown covers from the first. And Pete's Don't Look Away falls in the same category as the Keith and Roger songs. So if Townshend and Entwistle had written this whole album together, it would've been great. Now it's only lousy. And Happy Jack should've been made a part of the UK LP as well as the US one..."
4,Very Helpful for the Person Interested in Homeschooling,"This book is 25 years old,and I think we've learned a few things in 25 years, but overall the basic principles in this book were eye-opening and thought-provoking. I'm no longer so fearful of the homeschooling idea and have gained a desire to know more as a result of reading Home Grown Kids."
4,"Good Sticks,","These are good sticks but I dont like the finish, when you get going they get a little slippery. Heavy weight and durable though."
4,Good but not enough discussion of birthparents,"My almost 5 year old really likes this book, and I like it also because it discusses adoption from a spiritual perspective. However, I was left uncomfortable with how it only lightly touches on the important role of the birthmother (and doesn't mention birthfathers at all). The use of the words ""birth lady"" felt awkward to me, since I think birthmothers deserve more recognition than that. Besides that point, I would highly recommend it for adopted children."
5,Finally a book on adoption that shows the positive and beautiful side!,In 2006 we adopted our beautiful daughter from birth and were told about this loving book. We could barely get through it the first few times we read it because it helped put into words the love we felt for our baby before she was even born. In 2010 we adopted our beautiful son and our family is truly God made. The glow in our heart is the only glow some women will ever have and these angel babies bring more love into our lives then they may ever know. I hope that kids who are adopted read it as older kids so that they will know that it was God's plan for us to be a forever family and that it is the greatest gift one woman could give to another. We LOVE THIS BOOK and I am giving it as a gift to a couple who is about to receive their heavenly baby in a few weeks.
1,Amy Angel Goes Home: A Heavenly Tale of Adoption,"I really do not like giving bad reviews on things. This book though, was so ridiculous, I did not read it to my son, I threw it directly in the trash. Perhaps I am too much into something more realistic as I bought 3 books and the other two were darling and I loved them as did he. This book, I felt, was annoying from the start. It was flaky and not aligned with my beliefs. My Mother tried to read it as well and thought I should not read it to him as it was like some Angel was in charge of things and not the Lord. So sorry for the bad review, but the other two books on adoption I bought were fantastic and I will rate them accordingly."
2,longwinded and boring,"she has some very cool ideas here and therebut for the most part, these books just drag on and on and on serving only to make some personal moral/philosophical statement that i think could have been saved for interviews or personal discussion"
5,You cannot believe it is one dude playing one guitar!,"At first hearing, you might think these are pleasant enough renditions of elevator-ready Marley covers performed by 3 acoustic guitarists. Then you realize there is only one fingerliscious cat playing bass, rhythm and lead simultaneously in real time on one guitar! The subsequent look on your face -- as though recently lobotomized and improperly medicated -- owes to futile mentation, to attempts at envisioning what Bub's fingers are doing to make it happen with such drive and touch. This is the real deal holyfield."
4,A Book not just to be read at Christmas Time,"As its tiltle suggests, this book is primarily centred on Mary the mother of The Lord Jesus Christ. The book comprises four parts: ""The Idea of Incarnation"" ""The Maid and the Miracle"" ""The Way Miracles Happen"" ""Learning to Grow with a Miracle""From reading this book, it's apparent that any attempt to suggest that Mary was, or is a Saint is very much diminished, but by the same token her humanness and her ordinariness are accentuated. The book is interspersed with personal accounts of how aspects of Mary's miracle have been applied to circumstances faced and encourages the reader by covering areas most believers have encountered.At the back of the book, there is a section entitled ""Questions for Reflection"" where you can be open and honest with yourself and allow the Holy Spirit to minister to you."
5,Great!,"Excellent overview of America's most scenic and sometimes breathtaking terrain (did you know Death Valley has a park?) with stunning cinemaphotography, commentary, and interviews with park owners, managers, forest rangers, employees, etc. All the major parks, with their lodges, chalets, and cabins are brilliantly photographed, inside and out, in this colorful PBS production. I enjoyed this DVD set immensely. So will you!"
4,Very moving collection,"This really reminds me of how lucky I am to be an American. Some of the songs are a little cheesy (can you say ""Coming out of the Dark"" and ""Lean on Me""!) but they all have the sentiments we need right now. Hope, resiliance, love for our country and one another....Celine Dion's version of God Bless America is wonderful, the choir singing the star spangled banner is fabulous, too.And Land of Hope and Dreams, which was always a very special song to me, took on an unparallelled patriotic beauty.I would have perferred an actual CD of the telethon lineup, but this one will nicely suffice in the meantime."
3,Celine's Song is the reason to buy this,"This compilation is good if you like the artists featured on the CD. The reason I bought this title was to get Celine Dion's fabulous rendition of God Bless America and to finally get a copy of Lee Greenwood's God Bless the USA. Frank Sinatra's America the Beautiful was also good, but the rest I could take it or leave it."
4,God Bless America...an appropriate title for this cd.,"In light of all of the events of the past two months, both here and abroad...this compilation appeals to the patriot in all of us. It has songs that comfort and inspire...the opening ballad of ""God Bless America"" is sung by Celine Dion. Her voice is soothing and comforting...Then there are contemporary songs such as ""Hero"" by Mariah Carey and Billy Gilman's ""There's a Hero"" that are a tribute to all the men and women who risked and lost their lives on that tragic day...September 11. And Lee Greenwood's ""God Bless the U.S.A."" has a way of making you proud to be an American, no matter what your country of origin may be. This is not just a compilation thrown together at the last minute to cash in on the patriotic fever sweeping the nation. It is well thought out and a joy to listen to."
2,Wait for the real thing,"I'm waiting with great anticipation for a CD of the actual telethon, which had some of the most amazingly graceful musical expressions in response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attack the country has heard. This CD seems like a ""cheap"" attempt to cash in on what was truly a work of national art. Some of what is on this CD is certainly patriotic, and some of it is fine music on its own, but unless what you want is a set of patriotic elevator music, wait for the real deal."
3,Song Incorrectly Listed,"Overall this is a pretty good CD. Just to let you know, however, that the song ""America-My Country 'Tis of Thee"" is listed as being on the CD. It is not on the CD; in its place is ""We Shall Overcome"". Since ""America"" is the song I was really looking for, I was disappointed when the CD arrived."
5,Very Nice Contemplation,"While you will be hearing nothing that you haven't heard before on this album, it is a very nice contemplation of songs in rememberance of this tragedy. I have listened to the entire thing multiple times, and it leaves a smile on my face each time I listen to it, just because it makes me happy that such beautiful music can come from my fellow Americans. This is probably one of the best contemplations out there of music in rememberence of everything that has happened, especially if you are into mainstream/rock/adult contemp. music."
4,Patriotic Sounds for Emotional Times,"I bought this CD because I wanted a strong instrumental rendition of many well-known American Patriotic Marches. For the most part this CD meets that expectation. I especially liked the individual U.S. military branch marches. One Critism, which doesn't make this CD bad -- is the second track, America the Beautiful, which is part instrumental with intermittant vocalists: Its would have been better in my opinion without the vocalization. There are also some other themes toward the end of the CD, like the 1812 Overture which are performed well, but not what I was looking for in this CD -- I wanted more of Sousa."
2,Missing Songs,Where is Neil Young's version of Imagine? Where are the songs from Billy Joel and Tom Petty?This CD is missing some of the best songs of the night.
3,a substantial portion of the proceeds,"Does this album need to be reviewed? Just reading the artists and the song titles tells you all you need to know. Dylan is great, Springsteen is great, Celine stinks, Mariah stinks, etc.What we need to know is why ""a substantial portion of the proceeds received by...Sony will be donated...""? Why not ALL of the proceeds, oh great corporation?"
1,not satisfied,"This sounds terrible, good cause though.If you want a good patriotic cd, go with Lee Greenwood."
4,Gut bustin' comedy.,You won't get much on this cd that isn't on the others but who says that's bad?. It's more of the same. But I enjoy this one more because they got rid of the Roy Fishin' reports.
4,Good phone for the money,"I have had this phone for 9 months, and the only thing I can say wrong with it so far, is the weight and look. It is not bulky but they could have given it more of a sleek look. The phone does have a few features that are nice. It allows you to place the handset on the base either face up or face down, this comes in handy since it has Caller ID capabilities. It also allows you to always have a charged spare battery right in the base and out of sight in case of power failure. Sony phones from my experience are pretty good. I have not needed any repairs as yet but I did need general info and they (customer service) were helpful. Since I last purchased this phone the price has dropped a little so shop around and check for a good deal."
5,Sleepless in Portland,"I tried every tip in this book but nothing worked. Nonetheless, it was a great book. It's funny and well written and the doctor has obviously thought a lot about this topic and done a lot of research. But, he never knew a kid like my kid. HE SAYS EVERYTHING AT TOP VOLUME! And mostly, it is screaming. However, I gave this book to my sister and it worked like a charm with her baby. Go figure!"
1,It would be better in hardback,"A rollicking good read! I laughed, I cried, I ran the whole gamut of emotional experience. Unfortunately, my baby kept crying no matter what I did. And since the darn thing's a paperback, it wasn't even that effective in knocking the kid cold when he wouldn't shut up. Anyone who thinks this book is useful must either be a relative of the author or someone he owes money."
3,For class,"This is for one of my classes so it is serving it's purpose. It is also a okay read, simply and easy to understand."
3,Patterns help but still need the notes,As an extremely amature musician I found this book very helpful. After working on scales and chord progressions this method helped me round out some of the basic jazz patterns. I found that the repetition of the patterns helped engrain them in my mind.I would recomend this book for anyone who would like to learn improv.
4,Lady Saw,"Great cd! If you are a Lady Saw fan, then you have been waiting for this cd. A must buy for reggae fans!!"
4,"So far so good, but heavy","Received the ladder about 10 days ago and have lugged it around the house for small jobs. It is heavy, no way around it. This is the Type I ladder, which weighs about 5 lbs less than the IA. Ladder is very sturdy, have not put it through its paces yet, only used it as large step ladder, no use for extension ladder on my property. I have watched the video that came with ladder and people on tv are opening and closing with ease. I have not found that to be 100% true, it takes some effort and pushing on the hinges to get them open and then snap in place. Bought the ladder through Amazon and Ladder Mart shipped it to me. It was on time, but might have not been a new one, a little dinged and scratched, their customer service was courteous and responsive. When I emailed them during working hours, they emailed back within a few hrs. A good experience"
2,"Good quality, but too heavy for one person","I bought the Little Giant ladder (22) and while it's a great quality ladder, it's simply too heavy and I'm in good shape and work-out regularly. Even w/ my teenage son (19), we sometimes had problems moving the ladder. I hear they've come with a lighter ladder series, but from what I can see it only saved 4 lbs. (42 lbs for the Classic to 38 lbs for the XE)We returned our ladder to Costco because it was just too heavy. If you have the smaller LG ladders, then maybe you won' have a weight issue, but be careful about the LG 22 models!"
2,A better option,"As another person suggested looking for another media player/recorder I found one here, and actually bought 3 for each LCD TV in my house :)MyHD Media Extender and Recorder BM3030"
2,Nice quality sound but accidently turns on easily.,The poor location of the on/off switch facilitates accidentally turning on the unit. Frequently replacing batteries diminishes my enjoyment of this otherwise fine product.
1,Wrong color,"I have purchased this particular knife because of it's translucent ruby color, but they've sent me a regular red one, offensive, but I had to tolerate there is no other way, since I live a lot thousand miles away from the delivery place."
3,an excellent 80's B movie!,"Mind killer is one of those great forgotten direct to video 80s gems. The story is totally wacky and bizarre. A nerdy librarian finds a manuscript about mind control and puts into practice what he learns,(with gooey gory results of course). working with an obvious low budget, mind killer still succeeds. I was never bored watching this. Mind killer draws from other b movies such as the manster and fiend without a face giving it that fun low budget horror spirit. This wont ever top anybodys horror movie list but for what it is it works. Would make a great double bill with the video dead."
1,"nope, not what you think it is.","This movie was completely and utterly stupid. I rented it at a Hollywood Video and was expecting a good bad b movie, but all i got was a bad b movie. If i remember it right, a guy watches a tv program and notices he can read minds, then as he continues to watch it, he can cause things to move and so on. His friend is a total nerd, and in the middle of the movie gets turned into a dog boy, what? Then he almost chops his friends fingers off with a paper cuter. At the end of the movie, the guys head gets enormus and shoots out pus and goo in a bathroom scene. With his big head, he starts chasing his girlfriend and then, when you least expected it, his head explodes and a midget, claymation monster comes out and starts running around, then the girlfriend zaps it."
5,A compact and sturdy choice,"One hundred thousand synonyms, 252 pages, hardcover, and a small compact size - a perfect pocket size thesaurus. About the only bad thing is that antonyms aren't listed alongside the synonyms. Of course, then it would be a much bigger book. If you'd like to have a sturdy compact thesaurus this is a perfect choice."
2,Poorly designed watch,The watch itself runs and looks OK. The real problem is when setting date and day. The screw in the crown has been poorly designed and it is a real a chore to set exact day and date.
5,Awesome Product,"The table arrived alittle behind schedule, but nothing too horrible. LOVE THIS PRODUCT! The table is well made and very beautiful. The picture doesn't do it justice. Would definitely recommend this product to those wanting a nice table in their kitchen or rec area."
2,Damaged top,"Very nice table for the price, but when it arrived it had a hole in the box . I was hoping top was not damaged, but after unpacking sure enough it had a large scratch on top . Kept table anyway due to using placemats to hide damage."
4,The Walker Sisters,My husbands family is from Appalachia so I always have an interest in this area. The Walker sisters were extraordinary women that lived in a harsh environment. Good read.
3,good art but the printing sucks,"The art of joe madureira is cool but ,the printing of this collection is really bad, the color is dull, the 'black' is not black enough, it's much more obvious when compare with magazine form, which's color is much more brilliant."
4,Good comics!,This has some great art and some great stories. The issues where Wolverine and Archangel team up are really cool. They are really hard to find in comic stores and they introduce some really important Psylocke Continuity. I would buy this volume if you like great art and cool characters on a mission to save their friend. This volume is cool because it has a good Wolverine/Archangel story but it is also cool because it has a great Gambit/Sabretooth story. Buy this comic if you love the X-men! I would have given this book five stars if it didn't have such a weak cover. The cover fell of the volume I was reading while I was still in the store. This isn't for the fan that sells his graphic novels later in life. This is just for people that don't really care what condition their books are in.
3,Great Art But Fell Apart,I'm a big fan of Joe Mad! He's art is very eye catching and appealing. So when this book arrived today ahead of schedule I was quite happy. I had went to bed and unable to sleep I picked it up and began to read. I already own all but the last two books in this collection so I started readying at the second to last. I did flip through to notice duller colors than in my original books but that's okay with me. As I ready holding the book in the normal manner suddenly I noticed in my hands the book had crumbled. I inspected the cover to find that it was no longer attached. The sections it appeared are sewn and then the groups are glued together. The glue gave way not after frequent use but through my first read! If there is a hard cover edition buy that instead! Otherwise be prepared with plenty of superglue! I hate to give a Joe Madureira collection only three stars but the fact that the book near instantly crumbled makes it so.
4,"Great, but still lacking","This was a great graphic novel. Joe Madureira is the greatest comic artist that ever lived, but I have one problem with this book: where is his final issue, Uncanny #350? After all, how can u have a collected edition, if u don't have the final issue?"
3,great joe art..,"Now that book is awesome.. joe art work at his prime when he was with x men.. MY GRIPE , is with the book's printing. This book will come apart from the cover at the spine. anddddd pages will fall out. As soon as you open the book you can hear the crackling of the glue and how the pages seemed to be tightly pressed together as if no one should ever open this book at more then a 45 degree angle :(Maybe in the future marvel will re-release this collect with avid readers in mind who like to fully open up their graphic novels/collected works and not just finger through a few pages and then let the book gain dust on the shelf."
1,Disappointed. Very cheap quality. Returning it now. Don't buy.,Title says everything. I doubt it will last even a month. Very cheap quality. Does not deserve even single star.
1,Air Flow meter was faulty/ Returned twice,"I ordered this item for my 2001 Nissan Pathfinder, the fist one after installation made the car buck & run horrible, Returned for a replacement & I believe they sent me the same one back.. I installed anyway & the car would not stay running.. Put the old meter back in & car runs fine exept for the SES light that wont go off.. ( error code indicated MAF) I would not buy this unit as I had 2 & Neither one worked correctly.. I will have to buy the $400 OEM one...I tried in a friends who had a working MAF & it did the same thing... Product is Faulty or not designed for 2001 Nissan Pathfinder...Time invested should have only been 30 Minutes, Instead I spent a good two hours with 2 non working MAF's... Very Unhappy... RC"
4,A great trading/sea battle sim.,"I love this game. The ability to trade, pirate, own business, fight for a goverment is great. It's really fun when you get your own parcel of land to be in charge of! The only downside for me is the sea battles, I don't understand why the enemies get to use all their attack ships at the same time while you're limited to just one. Seems a bit unfair. Oh well, overall a very good game!"
5,Port Royale 2,"Excellent game! My husbands favorite. Most people have trouble loading it on windows vista. So did we! Downside? He has to play this game on our old computer. Not so hot, when you just got a nice new computer.But I know for a fact the game is fantastic if your into strategy games."
3,Not s good as I expected,"The first time I used it, There were spots of ice on my windshield underneath the cover. Not enough to require scraping though."
4,Windshield Cover,"Was a great purchase for the price. With the Winter weather here, this makes a perfect choice to prevent ice and snow on my windshield."
3,It's ok,It is pretty thin and light. The magnets are not big enough to hold down on a windy day. Could use more magnets.
4,truck windshield,"We ordered this for an F150 based on the size. While the product worked well for the smaller cars it did not fully cover the truck windshield. We measured the windshield first before ordering so we were both a little suprised it did not fully cover the glass. We will keep this around for other vehicles as it does work well, but don't expect this to cover as much glass area as advertised."
4,winter warrior windshield cover,This produced worked very well. The suction cups were a little bit of a pain so I didnt use them.
3,Ok...but,"This helps whenever you have ice or snow forecasted and you don't really want to scrape your windshield. However, I wasn't really happy with the way the suction cups didn't seem to want to do their job by attaching to the inside windshield. Took a lot of extra effort."
3,Good For 3,"I bought this CD because of my insatiable appetite for Eva Cassidy's songs.The first 3 songs are so good I still get goosebums listening to them even 1 month after the purchase.the rest of the songs are very average,not to my taste."
2,"Good music, bad sound","I completely agree with the previous review. I like Alan Price's music, but his sixties hits on this collection sound terrible and the best seventies songs are inferior live versions. Don't buy this cd!"
4,"Buy This, Lots of Music, Little $$","a great deal indeed for this 2 cd set. 4 and a half stars. start of price's early years to 1980. wonderful songwriter, great live singer! his voice might sound goofy at first, but not bad at all.some of prices late 70's stuff were not too good, only a few songs are here from that time period.Not at all like his ex-band mate eric burdon!"
5,Historical fiction at its best,Every time I read one of the Thoene's books I learn a little more about history. I always wonder which of the characters are fiction and which are real life.
5,Key to Zion was a must read!!!,"This was an excellent example of Christian, historical fiction. The book has solid, real characters and after reading the whole series, I felt that I just returned from 1948. The history I learned through out was an added bonus. You will not be able to put down this entire series( 5 books in all)! It is so exciting how the scenes play out. There were several sections that I was surprised how the scene played out. I can usually tell a plot line a mile away, but this time I was kept guessing. I would love a movie made of this. Excellent, excellent book!"
3,Technology changes faster than a book can be reprinted,If this book was a dynamic work on the web it would be one of the best assets to IT management in healthcare. The challenge with any book published about technology is that many of the technical aspects have changed by the time it hits the shelves. The aspect of this book which redeems its value is the way in which they map out the functions of managed care to help it make sense.
5,Gamma lead tape,The tape sticks nicely and is easy to cut. It smudges a bit onto your hands so be sure to wash them after using the tape.
5,Just what I needed!,"Gamma lead tape is awesome - I have used several packs of the stuff on my tennis racquet, and it makes a great difference. Do some research online about properly weighing your racquet, but if pondering which lead tape to use, look no further. Sticky, does not peel off, easy to apply, easy to cut and reshape...good stuff!"
4,"Good, but flawed.","As difficult as a book like this is too science-y, this is the main problem of the book, and it gets progressively worse with each chapter. Not to say that I didn't like the book, I really did, but it was at its strongest when Ehrlich is applying his formidable abilities to more common-place topics than astrophysics.The analysis in last three chapters (involving time-travel, faster than light particles, and the big bang) was difficult to understand, and I went to one of the top engineering schools in the country. Ok, ok, I failed out, but I'm more likely to understand all of that than the layman."
1,Ehrlich trips over himself.,"Joel Kauffman's review is as close an honest reality check you can get for the contents of this book.I was skeptical about many of Ehrlich's own skepticism. When he appraoched and debated John Lott, I knew that Ehrlich's prose was more about convincong himself that his own sacred cows are beyond reproach. Lott dismantled most of Ehrlich's criticism to the degree that left Ehrlich stnading there in his tidy whities.This is not to say that a good share of what Ehrlich writes about here has underpinnings but even John Stossel knows better than to make some of the mistakes Ehrlich makes."
1,Very low level of sophistication,"The level of data analysis in this book is somewhat above op-ed writing, but not very much. Crime rates are analyzed without any other factors being accounted for. The analysis on energy is no more sophisticated. The guy should stick to his areas of expertise, but this is really poorly done."
2,Decent but nothing special,Bic makes good pens but this one isn't.My problems with it:1. The line is too bold for me. Which is a personal preference.2. The bigger problem I have with it is the rubber grip is too thick making it uncomfortable to hold.
5,These are wonderful!!,My son had one of these...and used it for the longest time...we looked in stores all over and could not find them...thank goodness we found them on Amazon!! We ordered several packs. They write so nicely!!
5,Great,"I bought 2 copies of this CD. One for our school and one for home. My children, (2 4 year olds and a 3 year old) just love listening to this in the car and they are now learning all the words to some great patriotic songs. Children relate very well to this music because it is young children singing rather than the typical adult choir. I would recommend this CD for any family with young children who want them to sing and be musically active!"
5,Plenty Good Room is an excellent first novel!,"I thought Plenty Good Room was magnificent. The characters made me laugh, cry and remember. Poor Bay Dawson tried so hard! But, alas, his reunion with his father was not as he had hoped. Teresa McClain-Watson is an excellent writer. I enjoy the book thoroughly!"
3,"Works fine, limited uses","I ordered this as a backup tool, for which it works fine. I find it strange there was not much info in the description from the company. I was worried it would be metal-colored plastic, but in fact it is steel.I don't like the extra holes it leaves, and the single-head nails went straight into the trash-find some small screws and avoid some stress."
1,Non-receipt,I may review this DVD -- IF I EVER RECEIVE IT. It ia almost two months since it was ordered.Please reply if is tp ne shipped.
5,Climb Aboard!,"The early fifties saw the end of the great MGM musicals. ""An American in Paris"" and ""Singing in the Rain"" are masterpieces in their own right. ""The Band Wagon"" was made at the same time and contains a treasure-trove of wonderful songs. The screenplay by Comden and Green has the same spark as ""Singing in the Rain"" but it deals with the viscisitudes of a Broadway (rather than Hollywood) production. While the show is full of zesty numbers, one has to wonder why Oscar Lavant was cast in his role. Aside from ""Louisa,"" his pianistic talent goes untouched, as does his acting ability (which no one would touch with a ten-foot pole). Otherwise, the score is wonderful (""Dancing in the Dark"" is superb) and the dancing is delightful. If fact, MGM used an actual used a shoe-shiner from LA to co-star with Fred Astaire in ""A Shine on Your Shoes."" The second disc contains scenes from the movie and a retrospective on Vincente Minelli--all worth watching!"
3,"Good, but not great","First, the good points: Fred Astaire is ... Fred Astaire, and Cyd Charisse is an all-time great Hollywood dancer. Some numbers, such ""The Girl Hunt"" and especially ""Dancing in the Dark"" are simply great.But the story doesn't even vaguely hold together. Almost none of the songs in the ""show-within-a-show"" have anything to do with either show, or advance the plot in any way. Jack Buchanan is fun in spots, but has an odd grimace when he dances. Oscar Levant just isn't that funny, and Nanette Fabray doesn't have much to do. The storyline about the disastrous production has great potential, but ........At times, Comden and Green are clearly trying to have it both ways - entertaining while making fun of a musical genre, but too often they don't quite make it on this one. There are some terrific lyrics, but it never makes it into the pantheon of great musicals."
5,"Hands Down, The Best Musical Ever","You will not find better talent, music, dancing, or production in any other film. Some are nearly equal - An American In Paris, Singin In the Rain, and down the road a ways perhaps All that Jazz.Pay no attention to the nay-sayers about this movie who want more plot and more dancing and more ... That is ludicrous. The best musicals always have...thin plots. Did you ever read Phantom of the Opera? Talk about a...story that was turned into one of the most popular musical stage productions ever.Enjoy The Bandwagon for what it is on the surface - loads of campy over acting and a great bunch of song and dance stars putting on some of the best on screen performances ever. Its pure 50's escapism that will hold up in any era. That's Entertainment!"
3,Questionable quality,"After using this product for only a year, it konked out on me. I didn't use it every day, either. The sound quality was fair to good, but the rewind/FF was pretty slow. The tape counter was a nice feature. I'm not too sure about Sony's product quality anymore. A few other electronics I've purchased have not lasted very long at all. This recorder just stopped working for no reason. Changing batteries didn't help and it was never dropped or damaged."
1,could not be shipped to Israel,"Probably very good item but I cant check, they do not ship to Israel. I spent some time choosing things, none of them could be shipped to Israel. Very disappointed.Please provide the list of permitted destinations to save customers time!"
5,Great Stix,"Great, High grip stix. I am new to this and these stix are wonderful. easy to use and cool colors. Quality made as well."
5,"Very sticky! Nice length, not too long.","Just got these in the mail (Master) and I love how sticky they are! I used to make my own with recycled bicycle tires and sometimes racket balls, so I was a little nervous buying a commercialized pair, but so far so good. I wish I could of picked the colors, but I guess that is why they are $15 cheaper here on Amazon than elsewhere."
3,BGM only,"Like the heading says: BGM only. This CD was one of two that were released for this anime series. The music is moody, melancholy, and uses the piano as one of the main musical instruments. It should be noted that the opening theme and the closing song ""RTB"" is not on this CD. That CD is even harder to find. If you can find it, it includes variations of ""RTB""."
3,Not quite what I thought.,"Live overseas in the BIG DESERT. Got four of these bottles in my bag to increase water intake at work. You can drink more in a sigle pull off of the nalgene bottle then a regular bottle of water. Got this for easier access. Down side is the decrease consumption rate. To much ""sucking"". Did what it was supposed to do but not what I was looking for."
4,"Great, funny, twisted movie!","I seen this movies back in the 80's! Absolutely loved it! Very funny comedy. Been looking for it for years. Of course I find it at the great, almighty Amazon!"
4,Principles Still Applicable Today,"This book was written long before digital photography, but the principles of composition haven't changed that much. Good reference for anyone wanting to learn more about photography."
5,Perfect in Jericho 941 FSL,"Hello, in this article my big fear was the position perfect in the gun, the pistol Jericho 941 FSL but is perfect in all sense, really is made to reference indicated. Now the iluminated dots, it's great, the time so I can say anything because I don't have time as years for probe the tritium but in the moment is very iluminated in total oscurity, I do the test in closed room, in the night, any light present in the enviroment. Thank you so much."
