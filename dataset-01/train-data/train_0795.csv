5,Must read,A must read before planning your own golf or vacation to Scotland. All the useful info one is looking for. An excellent book and reference guide.
2,Sub Par L & H,"""Lost"" for over two decades, L & H's fifth talkie offers little to talk about, unless you're a very serious fan/historian. One might expect some fun with Stan playing Male Nurse to Ollie's ""patient"", but the depressing premise, lame gags, and ""claustrophopbic"" set are not conducive to the kind of comedy the boys are capable of. I am happy to own this videocassette but I've watched it only a few times."
2,Stan and Ollie's Fifth Talkie,"After the excellent ""Men O' War"" and ""Perfect Day,"" Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy take a major step back in this early talkie. Depressingly claustrophobic, ""They Go Boom!"" (1929) moves at a funereal pace and offers few laughs. The climactic sight gag with the air mattress represents the sole highlight of a rather weak two-reeler."
4,Blast from the past,"This was an album that I enjoyed more years ago than I care to admit too.Great music from the past. The brass included by the Sons I beleive inspired many inovations in rock. ie. CTA,BS&t and more. It was good to hear again. If you are 60 years old,and loved music as a true HIPPIE, You will love hearing this selection once again."
1,A piece of junk!,"I received this supposedly factory reconditioned scroll saw today and set about putting it together. First, not all the parts were there. Second, the tilt table gauge was bent nearly 60 degrees out of whack. The variable speed knob just spins around and around and has no effect on the speed of the unit.This thing belongs in the trash can. If I don't get some satisfaction from Delta and The Tool Crib, it's sayonara to both of them.This saw is junk when it's brand new. Buyer beware!"
2,Reconditioned Delta Scroll saw,"The product is less than I had expected; basically a poorly engineered blade fastening system..Breaks blades with great frequency and discouraging to operate.Instructions for the model make references and photos of component parts not part of the saw. Name tag felloff, taped it to hold in place.Since purchase have observed new scroll saws for the same pricing.Bill Cunningham"
1,Music Match Jukebox,I had MM jukebox on my other computers for years and I love it. I purchased a new computer and could not get MM jukebox to download from the internet so I purchased the cd but I couldn't get it to load or run properly. I do love Music Match and still want it but I don't know what to do as of now.
4,Use with The Right Products,"If you use this iron correctly you will get great results. I use a little hair at a time and spray the hair with a soft mist of half water and half Ouidad Styling Mist. This solution sets the hair and makes each section shiny and bouncy and a little stiff. You want the stiffness. After you do the whole head let it rest for 10 minutes and then fluff it up with your fingers. Gently. The slight stiffness will disappear and the curly waves will last a long time. Don't burn your hair. Experiment. It takes a while at first but with experience it will go swiftly. There are other sturdier Triple Irons available, but this one is half the price of the ones that are bigger. You have to experiment, though. And be patient."
3,"It works, but....","I bought this iron with high expectation that I can change my hair style. I counld't wait to try it since it seems like a fancy iron. It does make waves but don't expect to look like the girl on the cover(or unless someone can help you, I guess). My hair tends to be dry after each use, so try some leave-in conditioner before use the iron. The build-in stand rest doesn't stay cool at all, and watch your ears when you iron the hair around them. However, it does make my hair fuller(but not waves), and it's a good looking iron with reasonable price. I wouldn't use it daily, but just for fun once a while. For daily use, I still prefer my traditional hair rollers."
3,Not quite right,"I was so excited to see this finally reprinted, I immediately bought a copy for myself and my one-year-old niece. Upon it's arrival, though, I was deeply disappointed to find that it is not an exact reprint. Several stories, including two of my *absolute* favorites, are missing. So, if you adore ""The Christmas Lamb,"" ""Mr. Hedgehog's Christmas Feeling,"" or ""The Lion's Plum Pudding"" beware that they are MISSING!!! I really wish another review would have mentioned this, because I would have thought twice about it, so I felt I must post this so you know exactly what you are getting. It is still a lovely book, and I cherish many of the stories that are there, but the ones that are missing leave a very big hole as far as I'm concerned."
4,LOTS of words!!,"Just know that this book is a very wordy book. I got it thinking it would be good for our almost 2 year old. She LOVES her Richard Scarry books so I thought this would be great to have for the holidays. It's a cute book with interesting stories, but it's not for age 2. It says reading level 4-8, I see that now!! :) We'll keep it for a couple years and bring it out again when it's more age appropriate! happy holidays."
5,a terrific book club choice,"What do you want from a novel? What I want is entertainment that makes me think. If your expectations are similar, I know you will find that ""Pope Joan"" delivers. Was Joan ever the Pope? Maybe, maybe not. The author, you must remember, is not trying to sell a history text (although she does a great job of taking the reader back to the ninth century).My book club chose this as its last read, and believe me, we had plenty to discuss! The result was an engaging, spirited debate about gender, religion, and the merits of historical fiction -- perfect! The fact that the author agreed to join us via speakerphone (an offer she extends to all book clubs) was icing on the cake."
3,"Came in like a lion, went out like a...well, it went out!","The story of Hrotrud the midwife is riveting, but it is just the beginning of the book! After that I thought it got too much like it was writen to become a movie. It became, for me, an overrated romance novel."
5,"Excellent portrayal of historical time, place, character","Pope Joan is an excellent book-- a real page turner. Character of Joan truly comes alive. I choose to believe the historical person did exist, and I hope she was even a little bit like the person Donna W. Cross portrayed in her novel. The time period of the Dark Ages-- the lifestyle, mores, and culture are illuminated. An excellent contribution to the genre of historical fiction. I am glad to know it will be made into a movie-- one I will definitely rush out to see!"
4,wonderful historical fiction,"I thoroughly enjoyed Cross's depiction of such a controversial figure. I am not enough of a historian to know if Pope Joan did or did not exist, but the possibility is a fascinating place to explore. I thought it was perpelxing that Cross's version of Joan rose to the high ranks of the Catholic church without being portrayed as particularly interested in spirituality. Her obvious preocupation was intellectual. It struck me that she seemed more likely to make her way into a medical education than clergical. Excellent reading material, like all good historical fiction, it makes me interested enough to research the subject further."
1,The ending was terrible,"The ending of ""Pope Joan"" was quick and sudden; an ending that did not do justice to the outstanding beginning portion of the book."
1,Religious prejudice on parade,"This novel about the fictional Pope Joan is a highly offensive caricature of medieval Catholicism. Catholics are presented as superstitious, immoral, violent cretins. The cloying narrative presents the medieval world as a fearful place inhabited by witches, goblins, and menacing bishops---everything but the tooth fairy.Although the author clearly knows (as every serious medieval scholar knows) that the legend of Pope Joan is pure fiction, she insists on pretending that the fantasy may have some basis in fact.A disturbing read, marred by raw religious prejudice."
1,Absolute Fiction - Spurious Anti-Papal Clap-Trap,"Okay Dan Brown fan's, pick this one up and have a good time reading about the fictional life of a ""Pope Joan"" who was the invention of Protestant polemicists in the 16th century. Simple minds will always want to believe such clap-trap in the same vein as Dan Brown's better reading ""The Da Vinci Code.""Fact: The interregnum between Popes Leo IV and Benedict III was only about three weeks - not the two years necessary for ""Pope Joan's"" alleged papacy.Fact: There is no historical evidence of any mention of a ""Pope Joan"" until the middle of the 13th century some 400 years later. This despite the many enemies of the papacy during the early Middle Ages who would have loved to have made use of such a scandal.A better read would be French Historian Florimond de Raemond's Erreur populaire de Papa Jane (""The Popular Error of Pope Joan"" 1587). But then again why bother reading the truth when a fictional account better supports one's prejudices."
1,"When history is confused with fiction, people are misled.","The first and most important thing to remember when reading this book is this: It is a work of fiction, which incorporates historical elements. It is not historical.It is fictional.Any good historian, whether Protestant or Catholic, knows this, and can easily demonstrate it.Keep this in mind."
2,poor woman,"I thought the idea of a female pope sounds nice and interessting. But for some reason I felt dissapointed. Poor pope joan is allowed to have sex only once and then immediatly suffers the consequences. I definitly disliked the part of the story that tells about her relationship. She seems to be to intelligent to be true but then loses herself totaly to a men, who of course is also better than believable. I would have prefered a different interpretation, after all, its fiction, isnt it?"
5,Creatively written,I am not going to summerize the story since that has been done already in the many reviews. This book was definately a page turner. I thoroughly enjoyed the story. Bravo to Cross for doing an incredible amount of research then creating such an interesting story based on folk lore. This book will entertain you and offer some insight into life during the Middle Ages. Definitely worth your time.
4,Interesting Theory,"Based on the legend that a female served as Pope between Leo IV and Benedict the III, Cross explores the woman that may have been and how she came to sit on the throne.What Cross does an excellent job of doing is using historical fact, characters, and events to construct a plausible story for the reality of Joan. I also really enjoyed her presentation of the arguments for and against the existence of the female Pope.What kept me from giving the book a five is that the story drags a little in the middle and I was unable to emotionally connect to Joan after she heads to Fulda. I loved the child of Joan, however.I was completely unaware of this ""event"" and enjoyed learning about the possibility."
5,Didn't expect to like it,"I'll be honest - the first couple chapters had me kind of grimacing. Let's face it - the dark ages were HORRIBLE. I'm not a big fan of (for lack of a better word) dark or violent books. Maybe I'm a wimp. But whatever the case, I thought for sure I wouldn't finish this book. Something happened around chapters 4 or 5, though. And soon I looked at the spine and realized I was 2/3 of the way through. ""Hey, I'm LIKING this book,"" I thought, surprised. And then I'd discover I was reading for an hour or more in bed before falling asleep, unlike my usual 7-8 minutes. And when I finished, after reading the author's notes, I realized this was one of the better books I've read in a long time. My only gripe (and this isn't related to the book), is that the note on the author indicates she's working on a new novel - how long must we wait?!?!"
5,Great read - pass it on and share it!,"This book was recommended to me and once I had a copy, it sat on my table while I read another. Once I finished the other book, I looked at ""Pope Joan"" and thought, ah, maybe not....However, the next day I started it and could not put it down! It was just such a great read and fun. I certainly hope the basis of the story is true. This is a book that I will be buying for Christmas for others, everyone should have a copy."
3,"Great history, so so book","The idea of Pope Joan is fascinating. To think that a woman could completely disguise herself to her peers and rise to the position of Pope! Cross obviously did a lot of research on the time period, as historical aspects fill the book. However, the story is just not there. It's like a stone skipping across the surface of a pond. There is no depth or feeling to the tale and the reader is practically told who to like and dislike. It reads like a superficial account of one's life, moved forward by historical events, but with no emotional commitment. The story has encouraged me to read further about Pope Joan, but all in all, I was not impressed with the story"
5,POPE JOAN - COMPELLING DISCUSSION NOVEL,I started reading Pope Joan in self-defense because all my friends had read it. I ended reading Pope Joan in awe. It is inspirational in that it brings to light the social problems existent in a yesteryear so equated to today's male/female soicio-economic structure. The religious philosophies of bygone days portrayed in the book are adherent of a structure not so unchanged in this 21st century. The story brings to light the steadfast desire of a young woman to become educated; it follows her entrance into the religious life as a disguised contemporary of the ruling male populous of the church. Joan accomplishes what no other woman ever has - but who is to say that it cannot happen again? Excellent reading. I now discuss this book with my friends. Read it and do the same.
2,Interesting historical curio in a badly written book,"Full disclosure: I'm not a fan of historial fiction in general, so I went into this book suspecting I wouldn't like it, but hoping to be surprised. And while I have to give the author credit for creating a rich storyline from just a sparsely documented and highly speculative piece of history, the writing just doesn't stand up as a piece of quality fiction in my mind. This book elicited many groans of ""ugh, seriously...?"", with a plot that is just too convenient and coincidental for smart reading. The character of Joan is well constructed and her good heart and dedication to learning are inspiring, but I'd recommend going to a piece of nonfiction or just reading the author's note in the back."
5,Great Book! Hard to put down. A real page turner!,An amazing woman. The story behind Pope Joan is very interesting. Always made you wonder what was around the corner.
1,Dreadfully written and researched,"I read this book through a Book Club, and that is the only reason I finished it. The historical research is dreadful and inconsistent. One of the pivotal scenes in the book has a Warrior Bishop and his attendants celebrating Mass unarmed! The explanations by the author in the rear of the book are very much in keeping with the paranoia of conspiancy theorists. The writing style was uninteresting, and the plot line was loaded with unbelievable coincidences. There may or may not be any truth to the medieval story of a female Pope, but this book does nothing to help solve the question."
2,a big disappointment,"I have to give myself 5 stars for finishing this simplistic, predictable effort.The premise is fascinating but the author didn't develop a believable read - and the romance was just too much for me - more like a Harlequin romance novel. I can't see this author rising above this level of writing, so I won't be purchasing any more of her books."
4,Complex and Fascinating,This was the first I've ever heard of 'Pope Joan' and I found the story to be no only interesting but written with tender truth. Tender truths not just about the character but also excerpts that you can apply to your own life. There's wisdom in this novel.
2,Disappointed,"After reading the glowing reviews, I was ready to sit down to a good read. I must say that I was terribly disappointed. It seems that the author took a good opportunity to tell a fascinating story and enlighten readers about a time unknown to most of us -- but fell into the trap of telling a love story. Glad I read it before my book group purchased it -- it didn't live up to its hype."
1,Poor re-telling of a ludicrous conspiracy theory,"""Pope Joan"" is a contrived rehashing of a late medieval fable circulated originally (centuries after the underlying events were supposed to have occurred) to attack the church from a distinctly non-feminist perspective. This book updates the legend in a way that illustrates two curious phenomena: feminist carelessness with historical fact and the appeal of outlandish conspiracy theories. The events described in this book neither happened nor could conceivably have happened, much less been covered up by some sort of wide-ranging clerical conspiracy. You will not find a serious historian who believes this story even remotely plausible. In contrast to effect of the best historical fiction (e.g., Robert Graves' I, Claudius; Sigrid Undsett's Kristen Lavransdatter; Marguerite Yourcenar's Memoirs of Hadrian) this book hinders rather than contributes to a deeper understanding of the rich reality of human history."
4,Okay; it's a novel,"4, not 5, stars...I felt the beginning sections needed some tightening up. It's possible that I would have preferred literary journalism to ""historical"" fiction. In some ways, Joan was a slighter character in her own story...always (or mostly) more virtuous, smarter, and cleverer than all around her. Cross gives us a huge amount of background information about the environment and various parts of society. This is an entertaining book. I now want to read other treatments of Joan."
4,So it's a page turner as the reviews say!,Pope Joan is perfectly immortalized by the lines in the book- a novel that documents the travails of a woman who lived in the medieval era and sought to defy all the rules that prevented women of her time from climbing the social and economic ladder. Pope Joan is one book you would want to read over and over again. It's one book you would want to have in your bookshelf and brag to friends.
4,Good People,"Be she real or not, Pope Joan inspired me. The story was compelling and provided a variety of good life lessons. It empowered and inspired. It combined conspiracy with historical fact. It was well balanced and I was sad for it to end. A good read regardless of your religious beliefs."
4,Enjoyable if you suspend your disbelief,"I really enjoyed reading Pope Joan. It was a well written book, the pace was good, and I found it difficult to put down.Part of the reason this book appeals to the masses is that the heroine, Joan, is so thoroughly modern. Even if you believe that a woman did actually attain the papacy (which I can believe), that woman didn't probably also discover germ theory, create modern concepts of legal due process, and discover modern medicine!! The author imbues her heroine (and the heroine's boyfriend) with modern logic, values, and tastes. In contrast to the other characters in the book (which are firmly stuck in the 9th century), we naturally cheer for Joan and Gerold.So, while this very thinly disguised tactic annoyed me at times, it also made this book fun to read in a way.Overall, I'd recommend this book. But I wouldn't recommend relying on this book to learn about social customs and values in the 9th century."
5,A VERY SPECIAL GIFT,"The Pope Joan book was a gift to me; not just of a book, but of a very special story; a gift of reading about an era where women were totally subservient, male-ruled and in dire need of education. From the reading of Pope Joan, one senses the urgency, desires and struggles of Joan to obtain an education and the dratistic measures she utilizes to procure that quest right down to surrendering her womanhood and garbing herself instead, in masculine identity. Her trials and tribulations in the face of adversity culminate in Joan achieving her highest goal. The pen that wrote Pope Joan has given us a gift. It has broadened our own education to an otherwise hidden part of history in the catholic church; a gift of insight and a gift of tremendous reading pleasure. Ms. Cross has achieved sucess in this wonderful historic novel. Give yourself a gift and read Pope Joan."
1,Good story -- terrible terrible writing,"Pope Joan is one of those books which make you think based on its concept; unfortunately, the writing and characterization is awful. If Danielle Steele were to write historical fiction, this would be it....The concept is fascinating; a woman, disguised as a man, becomes an inspirational doctor and eventually the Pope.Could it have happened? Blows my mind to think about it. Cool stuff.Could it have happened as written by this author? No, not at all. The depiction of Joan as a youth is terribly unrealistic; the language she uses is not authentic, not even for a gifted child. There is a romantic sub-plot which is not believable, and seems to be thrown in. It is not consistent with the overall characterization of Joan.If we're lucky, maybe it will be a movie-of-the-week with Tori Spelling sometime soon.(Note that the afterward is surprisingly informative)"
5,Riveting!,"I just finished this book and cant wait to pass it on. It is definitely one of my top 10. If you liked ""Girl w/a Pearl Earring"", ""Birth of Venus"", you will love this story. It is beautifully written, I couldnt put it down. Pope Joan has a strength and wisdom to be admired. This is a story of oppression, a heartbreaking love affair and another scandal in the catholic church. I will be the first in line when the movie comes out!!!"
5,Thoughtful historical fiction,"Pope Joan is a richly textured historical novel set in medieval times. Ms. Cross makes the life of the time period and women in particular come alive. Documentation says there really was a Pope Joan, making it fascinating to consider and read about this woman's gifts and life in a man's world."
4,A good read,"I really enjoyed this book. It was picked by my book club and I knew nothing about it. I'm glad I didn't read reviews before reading it. Yes, there are some plot elements that seem rather convenient, but the merit of the book is its research that the author blends seemlessly with the story she has spun. I felt like I learned more about life, not history, in the middle ages while reading this book than I ever did in any class before. The book is thoroughly enjoyable - a real page turner. By the end you'll wonder if it's fiction, non-fiction, possibly true, etc. I'd say that's the great part of this book. Much like the DaVinci Code, it makes you think about the history of the Catholic Church and Christianity in general and the title character makes it memorable!"
4,Women and The Dark Ages,Pope Joan was a spellbinding novel about a woman living as a man who became Pope for two short years. It provided a lot of insight into what it was like to be born a girl in that era. It provided a glimpse of what village life was like in the Dark Ages and how hard it was for people to survive. In some ways it was tragic that she was scared to go back to being a women and being able to enjoy a good marriage and children with the man that she loved. She did have a lot of guts and determination to pursue her love of learning and using that knowledge to minister to the sick. This was a very good read.
4,"Slow, but worth the read","The novel drags in spots, obviously in an effort to create a believable setting. An interesting peek into 14th century religious politics...not much has changed in all those years. Although the plot stretches somewhat to fit the argument that a woman served as pope, the author weaves in enough historical events to create a plausible story."
5,Pope Joan--loved it!,A fast read; it's a very engaging premise and presents a fascinating historical perspective. At times a bit fanciful--and the protagonist could use a flaw or two--but overall a compelling story. I enjoyed it very much and have recommended it to several friends.
4,Intriguing fiction,"The author admits this is a work of fiction, but apparently there is a legend of a female pope. Could it have happened this way? It's unlikely, but we'll probably never know whether it really happened.This is a terrific story that required a great deal of research to weave all of the historical characters, locations and events."
5,Pope Joan,"Our book club, for the first time ever, all agreed that this was a terrific read. It kept our attention and raised some very interesting questions. The author joined us at our meeting via speakerphone, and we discussed the book with her for 45 minutes. It was a great learning experience. Although it's a fictionalized story, it is based on meticulous research and made history come alive."
3,"Good read, but.....","I just read the last page and the first thing I thought was ""I'm finally finished, now what do I read?"". I liked the book but several times found myself comparing it to one of my all-time favorites ""Pillars of the Earth"" (which is much longer, but a book I didn't want to put down even after reading it twice) and it just couldn't compare. I enjoyed the character of Joan and found her to be a wonderful example of a strong, goal-minded woman but became quite bored with the ""can't be with the one you love"" scenerio between her and Gerold. The book became a bit predictable and I found myself skimming through many parts at the end so I could complete it only to find that I had successfully predicted the end midway through the book. Don't get me wrong I really did like it and probably would have loved it if I wasn't such a big fan of ""Pillars of the Earth""."
2,Try something else,"This was a quick read and somewhat interesting. The author certainly did a lot research. However, there was just something about the book that did not grab me.Also, to steal a friends a comment, ""Joan seems like too much of a superhero."" Honestly, is there anything she cannot do? Heal the sick, rescue people from floods, and play lawyer? Its a little over the top."
3,Not What I Was Looking For,"If you're looking for a book about the real Pope Joan, this isn't it. Though fairly well written, this is a novel and it reads like a standard romance novel. Lots of rules being bent or broken to accommodate the characters and plenty of drama.The author clearly did a great deal of research on life in the middle ages and incorporated as much reality as possible into the story, but if you're looking for information on the real Pope Joan or how a woman could have become Pope in that era, this won't be what you're looking for."
4,pope joan,Although lacking any scientific evidence the book presents a very interesting scenario that shows numerous clues for its authenticity.The fact that the catholic church denies all references to Joan makes the subject all the more intriguing.I'd have no problem recommending it for a read
5,"You go, Girl","I am not a Catholic, and have absolutely no stake in anything to do with The Church. So I read this book with interest, but no preconceived opinions.I found this fascinating.Joan is a girl of her time (~800AD) who is extremely driven and who, by a stroke of luck (good or ill, one cannot say), finds herself acting as a boy - her brother. She becomes a monk, healer, scholar, and finally...pope.There is some historical evidence for this myth, apparently. To this day, a new pope's tested for... wedding tackle.Whatever the amount of truth, this story was a wonderful read.(*)>"
2,"2 Stars for Idea, -3 Stars for Execution","What a great idea for a book! A female pope! An actual true story! What a bonanza for the author. But despite the early promise of this book, the story dissolves into some insipid dumb romance between our scholar lady character and some guy with some sword. (Who cares!) Yes, I am agreeing with some people here that she seems to have not one blemish upon her character. And her father is hilariously cardboard evil. EGADS! I am so mad at the author for squandering such a great idea for a novel, only to succumb to some re-hased fuzzy hued post-feminist garbage, chick lit conventions when it comes to character, and third rate plot. I guess we will have to wait for another book about ""Pope Joan"" that will reach the depth of character and artistry that you find in Toni Morrison, A.S. Byatt, and other great women authors.So a word to the author, if you have a great idea, make a great book just as good as that one idea."
4,"Very interesting, and made you think","This book was a selection in our companies book club and at first I was quite skeptical about reading as it was a subject I normally wouldn't read. Once I started reading the book it became a page turner, always curious to see what was going to happen next. My only complaint is that the author should have expounded went more into detail at the end but otherwise, it was a great book. I definitely will be reading more historical fiction books."
5,Fascinating story and fascinating author,"We recently read this for our monthly bookclub and everyone thoroughly enjoyed it. It had so many dimensions that we could have discussed it for a long time. We liked the fact of how Joan was such a strong willed lady and that it was her intelligence that made her the heroine and it was a book that everyone could enjoy and have the same desires that Joan had--to improve her position in life. What made the book even better was the fact that Donna Cross, the author, called us while we were having our discussion and chatted with us about the book, the movie, and herself. It was a fascinating story set in a time where many women were left in the background and Donna Cross is just fantastic in her efforts to call book groups discussing her book and share her thoughts."
2,Disappointing,"Great idea, but a little clumsy in the execution. Cross fills out the sketchy details of Joan's life nicely, making her an interesting and sympathetic character. However, there were a few too many melodramatic made-for-TV moments -- a character dying suddenly just as he's about to betray Joan, a Viking attack disrupting a wedding just at the crucial moment. Also, most of the supporting characters were one-dimensional and predictable; the ""bad guys"" (and there were quite a few) had no redeeming qualities whatsoever, which made them much less interesting. I did appreciate the author's afterword discussing the historical evidence supporting the existence of Joan; it's nice when historical fiction states just how historically based it really is. However, I was disappointed overall; the subject of the book really piqued my interest, but the writing was a bit too awkward to make it a truly good read."
4,Clearly Embellished but Entirely Fantastic.,"WONDERFUL story!! The author obviously had to take liberties when filling in the gaps of this historical anomaly because there is virtually no definitive documentation in existence to validate the legend. Unfortunately, several of these embellishments took the form of literary cliches (forbidden love, feminist grand standing, etc) but taken as a whole, I adored this book and read it in giant gulp-fulls."
4,Joan or John?,A sad and beautiful argument for the presence of a female upon the throne of Rome. Woolfolk weaves a tender tale with much description of the inner workings of the early Catholic Church. Her dialogue is insightful and assertive allowing the would-be character of Joan to truly be felt.
5,Best read!,"This has to be one of the best books that I have read. It is right up there with Ken Follett's Pillars of the Earth and World Without End. I did not want it to end, and then it did with such drama! The writing, the history, the intensity were breathtaking. I am waiting for another from Ms. Cross of this quality. It is a once in a lifetime read."
3,Refreshing but .........,Reminds me of the younger Astrud Gilberto. Refreshing and precise but a bit mechanical. Quite interesting none the less.I would buy her next issue though !
4,A Remarkable Find,"Orna has a unique voice and great band on this recording. I hope she makes more, because I really enjoy listening to this!"
5,Peanut Butter Duo Bars,I have half a bar with my coffee every morning before my workout....The best protein bar by far.
4,Its a heavy suppliment,People who want to build body real serious can go for this one.Its bit heavy food.Tasts is not really great but has 3ogms of protein.
5,Worth the price,The bag is the perfect size for my Gamo Wisper .177 air rifle. It was difficlut to find a quality bag that was large enough for the Noise Reducer. In addition the bag is padded so it protects the gun and has a good moister barrier as well. I also like the fact the zipper can be locked. Well worth the price if you value your rifle.
1,Disapointing... Trent's gotta be mad...,"Dude, this album is terrible. Vocals are lousy, musicalization is poor. They even change the lyrics of the songs. What was in the head of the girl who sings Closer? It's like ""the 'rated' version of Closer"". Instead of ""I want to (F-word) you like an animal"" she sings ""I want to call you my animal"". Does she even know the song? Has she ever heard NIN? I doubt it.Looks like they gathered a bunch of punk teenage garage band kids and asked them to record their covers and make some money with it."
3,Would've been great as an instrumental album,Weak vocals and censored lyrics detract from these otherwise polished acoustic recordings of NIN. Would enjoy this album more as an instrumental.
4,Great first RC toy!,"Got this for a friend's 3rd birthday. It was a hit at the party, and continues to be a hit almost a month later - though her poor dog does get chased by this little ladybug occasionally. It is very easy for little hands to control. My only complaint is that it runs a little loud, but what toys aren't loud these days? I think there will need to be one of these in our home when my little guy turns 3."
1,Died in <5 minutes,"We purchased the ladybug and inchworm buggies for our young girls. The girls raced each around the room for lots of fun. However, the fun lasted less than 5 minutes as the radio-controlled aspect of the ladybug stopped. Nothing changed. No appliances turned on in the home or phones that rang. We tried several ways to reset it to no avail. We plan to return it for a replacement as the inchworm has worked just fine. Make sure you have alternate gifts or plans if you buy this one!"
5,Do not read while drinking milk.,"I'm always grateful for the chance to use a Random Obscure Word Not Normally Used in Everyday Conversation. Like ""paroxysm"" and ""stentorian."" That said, ""The Book of Ratings"" literally sent me into paroxysms of stentorian laughter. It should really come with a warning label--""Do Not Read While Drinking Milk or In a Public Place Unless You Want People to Stare Curiously At You."" My favorite rating is in the Wizard of Oz Characters section--the Wicked Witch of the West: ""If water were the one thing that could kill me, I certainly wouldn't go leaving big buckets of it around my evil castle. ... And yet the WWW seemed so surprised. 'Oh, gosh, I'm dying here. I don't suppose there's any way I could have forseen this? No, because I'm dumb.'"""
4,Aspects of this Book,"Humor [and]Laughter is the best medicine, according to Reader's Digest - and who am I to argue with the Gods of bland, abridged, vaguely religious psudeo-news clips? Lore dishes out the laughter in steaming shovelfuls, thus keeping us really healthy, or else making everyone else in the same room somewhat uncomfortable over our intermittent cackling. Either way, it's a good result...The overall rating may actually take a bit of a nose dive because of the almost excessive randomness of some of the quizzes included, but it's offset by a Xena:Warrior Princess reference in the ""Greek Gods"" rating. So it's a wash...There are pictures! They're cool!"
5,yay! everyone loves brunching!,"brunching.com is one of the best sites ever, and now they have their own book! I got it the first day it came out, and it's really funny and witty and great. go buy it! it will make you roll around on the floor from uncontrollable laughter !"
2,add this to your book,"this book gets a D-it wasn't terrible enough to fail.. but it was darn close.if nothing else, it's a good addition to the rack of reading materials in the bathroom... who cares if you accidentally piss on it."
1,theyre ugly,I do not like these dolls they do not look good and they look like they are on a starvation diet overall i do not like these dolls but thats me to you they may look pretty but to me they look like they are trying to be cute
5,Another Great Edition,"As with the previous Tours I've purchased, this one parallels the same basic format. As some people think showing the mountain stages close to their entirety is a ""waste of DVD space"", I believe they do this specifically because these stages hold a higher interest to most people. It is in the mountains where the tour is won and lost. They show the highlights of the flat stages, and all of the sprint finishes, however the majority of the time is spent in the mountains. Once again the commentary is done brilliantly by Phil and Paul. If your a Tour fan, you'll definitly enjoy.Thanks."
3,Poorly edited,"This DVD set consists of 6 x 2-hour DVDs covering 21 stages of the 2004 Tour. If you missed stages 12, 13, 15, 16, and 17, you see them in almost their entirety as they eat up about 8.5 hours of the 12 hours. The 2 hours or so of downhill coasting that you see uninterrupted throughout those five stages is wasted DVD space. The first ten stages are crammed onto one DVD. My guess is that DVD one is the same in both the 4 hour and 12 hour versions. Additionally, the set would have benefited from a highlights montage of all the stages linked together with music at the end. Not a lot of effort put into this DVD set."
1,terrible stories,I expected more from this guy but this particular cd is not entertaining at all. Whoever said he was a great story-teller
5,Great EDC keychain tool,"I carry my Squirt S4 all the time on my keychain (except when I am flying). It's a crying shame Leatherman discontinued this tool. Thanks to leverage from the handles, the scissors are actually usable, unlike those on most other multitools, and I find that a much more useful item than pliers. I wish Leatherman made a shears instead of plier version of their larger tools. The knife blade is tiny and the only use I can find for it is to slit packing tape on boxes. The other tools are too small to be of any use."
5,Spiritual Enlightenment,"The Celestial Blessing -- ""For eight days beginning at midnight of December 28, 1999, while most of the world was welcoming the new millennium, the 17th Gyalwang Karmapa was fleeing his homeland across the roof of the world and over Nepal's frozen passes. On a journey fraught with risk and danger, one starry night at 5000 meters the 17th Gyalwang Karmapa heard the Divine Mother singing. The celestial melody soothed and emboldened his heart during the cold, silent journey."".... I was deeply touched by this sweet melody of joyful aspiration. I listen to this CD while practicing Qi Gong every morning. It soothes my mind as well as lifts my spirit. If you are troubled by this tumbling world, if you are looking for spiritual enlightenment, this is the music for you....Yuki from Japan"
1,LOW PERFORMANCE!,"My old Sharper Image trimmer is better than this! It has a hard time trimming ear hair up close and sounds like it will stop when I trim. It is advertised as 10,000 rpm, but sounds and feels like 100 rpm. You get what you pay for in the end."
2,not really as promised,I learned of this item as it was featured in Men's Health magazine. I am not real pleased with the performance. The motor is strong but the cutting performance is poor and the pivoting head more of a gimmick than functional. I have yet to find a good trimmer that does not rip hairs out and does what it claims.
2,Conair Nose Trimmer,"This bugger has power. The head is a bit larger than most, and it is LOUD. It does an ok job, but not as good as the Panasonic I had before. It doesn't trim as close as I'd like. If the size and attributes of the Panasonic could be combined with the power of the Conair, it'd be perfect."
5,RayOvac Roughneck is a tough one,"I own several of these flashlights. One was used at work and dropped from the top of a 40 ft tank with no damage. After years of industrial use it looked rough. The switch finally would not work so I sent it to RayOvac and recieved a new replacement. They are waterproof, have ajustable beam, and easy to carry. Not fancy, no frills, just tough."
3,Not bad...,"Sylvie Montague is in Scotland to catalogue the gems from the estate of a recently deceased drug dealer. Unfortunately for her, her bag is switched with that of a jewel thief, Luca Colceria, and Sylvie discovers she is now in possession of the famed Katerina's Blood. Katerina's Blood is a cursed jewel and Luca is scared to possess it for fear the curse will befall him. Luca informs Sylvie that he was paid to steal the gem by Paul Maigny, Sylvie's childhood love and savior, but Luca now wants to return it to its home country of Romania. Sylvie is torn between the two men, both wanting to possess the gem, while she only wants to turn the gem over to law enforcement. This book is packed with non-stop action although I found the overabundance of car chases somewhat distracting."
1,Even Weaker Than I Am,"This item snapped after one month of use, with pieces flying across the room - could have been dangerous. I was only stretching it slowly while gripping the handles in each hand, and I'm not particularly strong."
3,Harder resistance than I thought,I'm quite out of shape and could have used even less resistance. But I'm sure it is fine for most people.
4,Mind Candy,"I call it Mind Candy and for a good reason. You don't have to overthink it, you don't have to worry about plot twists. You see it for what it is: an escape from reality. The men are easy to look at, funny and smart. The women are people you'd like to know - not someone who would completely overshadow you. These are feel-good movies. There's nothing wrong with that."
3,Too political,"...the producers of this film did a great job of showing real women giving birth naturally without excessive medical intervention. ...this video showed what I wanted to see.I was annoyed by the persistent political message about the importance of midwives and how America needs to move away from the sterile, medically assisted births and unnecessary C-sections so common throughout the past 50 years. I found it particularly odd that they featured a woman illegally practicing midwifery to support their claims."
4,Yo!,"I love the beat to this song, but I'm very annoyed with the fact that he has to diss him MOM on this track. That's what Eminem's doing, and Mr. Bubba just sounds silly ripping (the awesome) Eminem off. Moving on, the lyrics are O.K. (good, nothing life changing), I like how they sing the chorus. Good rap song, I reccomend it for rap fans, but everyone else, thsi won't change your mind."
5,Masterpiece,After Mothership Connection ... where could they go? HERE! All the ingredients that make the PFUNK experience irresistible. A little lighter and brighter.
5,funkenstein is here r u ready to funk,george is truly gifted to me he predicted the rise of rap music which artists have cloned every good and bad piece of funk from the good doctor funny as hell the mob was banging iv'e been watching you is a good ballad too bad parliament did'nt do many love songs thank god bootsy did glen goins singing is superb too the whole concept is blazing may the funk live on r.i.p glen
1,"Weird, Wacky And, Well, Bad","Sure he was important, but he still [stinks]. This album is Rocky Horror meets Barbarella meets well, funk. F"
4,Good and Bad,"Season 4 finally makes it's debut after what seems an age and months after the European and Australian versions. The cover is different than it's foreign counterpart and appears to look like an amateur has designed it with cheapo software. The episodes for most part are very good, but there seems to be an obsession for disguises and make-up. There are some awful episodes but the serious ones make up for the bad ones. Can't get used to David Soul sporting that moustache though."
4,Show is on DVD,"i was happy to see this show is on DVD because i have a family member who loves the show, watched it on TV as it was new and wanted it on DVD."
5,The last season of a great show!!,"All I need to say is that it is wonderful to be able to watch these darn fine final episodes of what had been one of the finest cop-shows we had back in the 1970s. If you mlike Starsky and Hutch at all, then you have to purchase and get lost in this, their final season of fun and mayhem!!!"
5,Out with a bang!,"The show had a short shelf life but Season 4 got back to more of the gritty police cases mixed in with hot chicks. Season 3 seemed quite political with issues like homophobia, USA vs USSR, etc. It was a fitting end to the 70's seeing as shows like Magnum and Simon and Simon were more innovative and took over in the 80's."
3,Top supper club singer,"Bob is great form. Still looking for Hank Jones,Ronnie Bedford,George Mraz in the video. Did I miss something?"
5,An Insight on a Future Revolutionary.,This is a great book that gives an illuminating insight into the events that molded a future revolutionary leader...and the most inspirational of the writings on his young life I have found. His special relationship with the lepers of the South American continent lends a human aspect to the rose-colored life of this future revolutionary.
3,"A humourous moving adventure, embellished with time","I found this book entertaining and interesting yet I could not help wondering how much of it WAS written by the 22 year old Ernesto and how much of it was written by the older ""Che"" in Cuba. I felt that too much was added in hindsight for the book to truly work. It felt like I was being presented with an ""On The Road"" copy mixed with why a young medical student became a great revolutionary.... and don't get me wrong, I admire Che enormously. I feel the book should not be taken as a great work of literature or philosophy. The only importance this book holds is that it was written by a great man whose memory will live on a lot longer than the memory of ""The Motorcycle Diaries"". Not everything a great person does is great, sometimes the things they do can be, in this case, just ok."
3,Lads on the road,"The text of the original motorcycle diaries gives a strong sense, much more than the movie, of the factors that influenced this artist/activist as young man. Idealistic, cheeky, sexually libidinous, political, strong minded. Che and his older companion set off on a wild journey across South America. The wretched poverty they witness across that continent - especially when he shares a blanket with a destitute beggar high up on the Andean Sierra - strikes home, as well as some of the aesthetic beauties of the wild and mystical land, such as the Inca ruins around Cuzco, Peru. Che's description of the stonework at the Sacsaywaman fortress rivals the greatest travel writings of Robert Byron, Bruce Chatwin or Patrick Leigh Fermor in its stylishness and accuracy of description.In places the narrative drags though, obviously written at points of sheer exhaustion, or boredom, or lack of inspiration."
3,A personal portrait,"What surprises me most about this book is how much more real and good and personal Che Guevara seems to me after reading it. I have seen the movie and expected the Diaries to be much more political, but there is actually only a single passage in the Diaries about a unified Latin America. He is moved by the conditions of the people he encounters and specifically notes aspects of healthcare that desperately need improvement, in addition to economic factors like how the mining industry impacts communities, but his notes seem to be much more personal than political. It is his personal voice that really impressed me and makes me want to know more about Che Guevara as a leader."
5,Che Guevara on his motorcycle journey to see Latin America,Che Guevara details his journey as he moves from Ernesto to Che in his revolutionary travels. Also what is his effect on the rest of the world.
4,The Motorcycle Diaries,"A good book but I didn't find any evidence of this being a ""Movie Tie-In Edition,"" unless it's the pictures on the cover."
2,A Let Down,"This book is said to promise excitement and wisdom, but in reality it only scratches the surface. Che's remarks about both indigenous and black people is pretty shocking as well. I found myself wondering where the insight regarding the plight of the proleteriat was (aside from a few fleeting observations already given to us in the introduction) amid his pseudoanthropological observations. Perhaps Alberto Granado will offer something more fulfilling!"
5,This book gets into the mind and personality of young Che.,"The Motorcycle Diaries makes us see the early Ernresto Guevara. His ambition to seek new adventures while trying to survive under poverty makes this book fascinating to read. His rebellious spirit and willingness to seek justice shows up in this book, which gives hints about his legendary future.For more information about Che Guevara read, ""Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life"" by Jon Lee Anderson."
2,Interesting character but writing is bland,I understand that he was an important historical figure but his adolescent writings are pretty uninteresting.I much preferred the movie over the book.
5,the best book ever,"this is the best book about my idol ""che"" guevera which was the best person to live since god and that his assasination was underserving and messed up they should kill the people who killed ""che"""
2,a bum and a con-man,"It reminded me a little of Mark Twain'stravel books and some of Hemingway. They were both better writers.The translator appears to be British or Canadian which doesn't help a lot ( lorriesall the way through for trucks or whatever else they were?).You can't claim he was a civil right activist: his commentsabout the South American Indians show he wasn't very much interested in other than those withSpanish heritage. I've read Hitler's book from prison , Gandhi's works and some of Marx.All are better political writers than Che here.This fellow comes off as an opportunist who happens to be a doctorwith a bad case of asthma. I think he was an educated man and very intelligent.Is there some other better example of his mature writing?I don't think this does a fair job of representing him.His only redeeming feature was his involvement in treatment of leprosy.From this book he comes off as a bum and a con-man."
3,Is Che Guevara a hero ?,"Brad Delong, Matthew Yglesias, Armed Liberals and others have been having a discussion about whether Che Guevara can be considered a hero. Here is the hero in his own words:""During the night I had a bad case of the runs and, being ashamed to leave a souvenir in the pot under my bed, I climbed out on to the window ledge and gave up all of my pain to the night and blackness beyond. The next morning I looked out to see the effect and saw that two metres below lay a big sheet of tin where they were sun-drying their peaches; the added spectacle was impressive.""(From The Motorcycle Diaries)Sorry, but I see nothing heroic in sticking one's arse out the window and letting drive onto a pile of fruit. I would never do that- but then, I'm not a communist.I was recently in venezuela ... I wish the people well. But I sadly fear that there are going to be a lot of tears shed when all is said and done."
5,Spanish Class,I use materials like this to make my Spanish class more interesting. The life of Che is filled with controversy and adventure. It is good for students to be able to read his diary to be able to understand the man.
1,the book is not well printed,There is something wrong about the book. I think the book was just reprinted from an old copy with labels and marks on it. It is not a new book. There are so many print problems on this book. I wish I could show you some pictures I took from it. I was upset about it. Could anyone contact me to solve the problem?
1,It's always old news by the time it arrives.,"I agree with the other reviewers, the magazine never arrives on time. It took 3 months to finally get started and now I go 3-4 weeks before a few finally trickle in. I never get them all. My address label is always placed on top of someone else's address label. I have called customer service (800-228-4957) many times and nothing has ever been resolved. I subscribe to other weekly magazines and do not have this problem with them. I will never subscribe to Life & Style again."
2,Never know when you'll get it,"Decent magazine as far as content for fashion and gossip, but I also agree with another reader with the fact that you don't know when/if you'll get one. I won't get one for two weeks, then I'll get three at once. Then nothing for two weeks, then one will come. Very sporadic. I emailed my complaint and will see how/if it gets resolved. I've never had any other issue with weekly magazines."
3,Life & Style Magazine,I am disappointed that the magazine comes so late by mail - almost one week from the time you can buy it in the supermarket.
2,Needed a Strong Editor,"This is an extremely complex book, where FD indulges in frequent philosophical digressions, indulging a few personal vendettas (notably Turgenev) along the way. These are tedious, in places, and grind the already creakingly slow plot to a painful crawl. The book was originally published in a periodical, and in a hurry, so presumably without the strong editor it desperately needed. However, the aimlessness and intellectual bankruptcy of the atheist nihilists is crystal clear (FD's purpose in writing the book), as does the sense of panic throughout Russian society: the unrest among the serfs and young radicals presented a problem for which the ruling class had no solutions.In itself, that was poor reward for wading through nearly 700 pages."
2,Needed a strict editor,"This is an extremely complex book, where Dostoyevsky indulges in frequent philosophical digressions, indulging a few personal vendettas (notably and most amusingly against Turgenev) along the way. These are tedious, in places, and grind the already creakingly slow plot to a painful crawl. The book was originally published in a periodical, and in a hurry, so presumably without the strong editor it desperately needed. However, the aimlessness and intellectual bankruptcy of the atheist nihilists is crystal clear (FD's purpose in writing the book), as is the sense of panic throughout Russian society: the unrest among the serfs and young radicals presented a problem for which the ruling class had no solutions. That in itself did not make the book worth reading or indeed writing."
2,A hellish book,"I must confess I do not care for Dostoyevsky and this is probably his weakest and least probable book. This is the book that he wrote as a kind of apology for having once been a revolutionary. While I can agree that the people who populate this book are scoundrals and this probably is accurate, the ending is just horrible. Here we have the old revolutionary, ""People's Will"" stalwart marching through the snow having been discarded by everyone and on his deathbed crying out for the gospels. I just did not buy it and do not think anyone really can suspend disbelief to do so either."
2,For fans only; early L & H effort isn't typical,"Stan and Ollie are cavemen in this silent farce comedy filmed in 1927. Laurel and Hardy weren't yet a team, so they appear mostly as solo characters: Stan as a sissy and Ollie as a bully. There is some decent visual humor (including a shot of the prehistoric ""flying elephants""), but the soundtrack for this tape is terrible, as a single 78-rpm instrumental is heard for a mind-numbing ten consecutive times. Turn the volume down and enjoy the sight gags."
2,skip this package,"YESTERDAY ONCE MORE is not representative of karen carpenter's best work.Several cuts on this 2-CD package are horribly dated 70's bubblegum tracks.(sing,calling occupants,sweet sweet smile,etc).a few others are mediocre album cuts(those good old dreams,because we are in love,etc).Much of her best material was not included,and some of these remixes are noisy and BASS heavy.INTERPRETATIONS is a more cohesive compilation of her best work."
4,Excellent buy,"This CD includes the full version of ""Calling Occupants"" with the radio DJ satire in which he answers the request line and winds up talking to ET.Sounding better with age: ""Superstar"" written by Leon Russell."
1,Power module stops working after a year or so!,"Olevia's have a specific problem that shows up after about a year. The red light blinks once when you try to turn it on, then won't turn on. The internet is filled with these complaints. I just paid $110 to have it fixed, and it's doing it again. I did see a Flickr video instruction on how to fix it yourself for $15, if you're handy with tools. A real dissapointment! As far as I'm concerned, a piece of junk!"
1,TV did not last 1 and 1/2 years,"Last May, (2007) as a gift I received a 32"" Olevia TV, Model #LT23HVX. Two days ago it stopped working with only the little red light going on. This TV had a 1-year warrenty so repairs will not be covered. Regardless, I think a TV should last at least 5 years, NOT LESS THAN ONE & A HALF YEARS! After asking a few questions and having us change the cable, flip the master switch on and off 10 times, etc. Olevia/Syntax Customer Service reps concluded the TV needed a new power supply installed at our expense. The 32"" Olevia by Syntax TV is now sitting mute with its screen dark. You may want to think twice before buying a 32"" Olevia by Syntax TV (Model #LT23HVX )."
1,NOT HDTV,"i dont care what the box or this ad says (or the kmart ad, or the staples ad) it is not hdtv - it is etv - there is no option to change the aspect ratio or screen format [480i or 568i max (whatever 568i is]).it might be great for dvds (didnt try it), but i packed it back in the box about 15 minutes after i hooked it up - spend a little more and get a true hdtv tv - thats what i'll be doing in the next 2 hours."
1,Good clean fun!,"You must be joking. This has to be the most ridiculous garbage i've ever heard. These parents actually want their kids to be subjected to this corperate souless trash? Kids can not sing. How is this even considered ""music""? It's just a marketing scheme. Where does one draw the line? I can see some big record executive easily making an ""Oldies"" version of these pop songs,sung by old people, if they thought it had a good chance of selling. Where does this stop people?Do me a favor, and if your kids want to get into today's ""pop"" music,introduce them to real music with real heart, such as The Beatles. If you think ""integrity"" is a value you want your kids to understand, turn off the radio and MTV, and buy some music with merit before your kids start dressing like pop diva's and acting all sluty for attention. Remember, young kids replicate what they think is cool."
1,For Little Kids?,"I have to agree with the other review I read on here. I seen a commerical for this CD on TV and was shocked. Songs about sex and what not that I'm not even sure I would let a teenager listen to being geared towards little kids. It's just disgusting. I have to wonder, can Liberals stoop any lower to demoralize the youth of America?"
2,A Really Annoying CD,"Ok, first of all, why ruin the songs with little kids singing over them? Why don't you just make a mix of those songs WITHOUT the kids?!? And also, the music videos with the kids are really stupid and annoying. Most of them don't even have the real subject of the song in them! So in conclusion, this Cd totally SUCKS!!!"
1,get super star kidz!,"at least the super star kidz have more talent! you have to buy it on tv, but who cares! the 4th one will most likely be better though. it has better songs. hey baby sounds ok, but dont listen to complicated, it nearly killed me."
1,Kidz Bop 3,"Five words: do not buy this album. Or any of the other Kidz Bop albums. I have the first two. Big mistake. They turn great songs into horrid performances. I mean, Avril Lavigne's care-free tomboy feel is completely lost in their version of 'Complicated.' It sounds like the singer is the kind of person who's concerned with their hair, makeup, and face. The kids are terrible singers (off pitch, off melody, off key, and plain way too high) and the lead vocalists are horrid, too. If you like people like Avril Lavigne and think the album will sound just like her, you're wrong. Buy the real album, not this horrid CD."
1,Kidz Bop STINKS!,"If you love music and love listening to all the new pop hits, I have a few words of advice for you: DON'T BUY KIDZ BOP! don't buy vol. 1, 2, 3, Christmas, or any others that come out. The kids sound like a broken record or nails on a chalkboard. They don't even sing the songs in the right tune. So, if you want to music, get the albums that come out made by the actual artists. Don't waste your time and money listening to a bunch of stubborn mules sing! But, if you like listening to awful music, (well you can't really call it music. Let's call it screeching!) the Kidz Bop series is the one for you!"
5,5 year old,I like all the songs on Kidz Bop 3. I have the other CD's and I listen to them all the time. I like that they are recent songs but have some words changed so that it is appropriate for my friends and I to listen to them. My older cousins like to listen to them also. I would recommend these music CD's.
1,this is VERY ...(and I Mean it),"The reason this ""music"" is stupid is because I know what they are doing.The stupid people who made this GARBAGE can't aford the real person , so they get real bad immitators(ex. soak up the sun and a thosuand miles sound nothing like the real people).My little brother gave a thousand miles (w/out little kids) a C. He thinks ""kidz bop"" rocks.I also noticed that in the comercial,they can get the real people to sing,but can't get them to sing for the c.d.!Don't buy this,it is a waste of money. Simon will go Deaf if he gets it.Leading to a tone deaf america: Kids Bop 3"
4,Great POP for Early Rockers,"I think it is interesting that most of these reviews are by Pre-Teens and Teens. It is called Kidz Bop and not really meant to be ""professional"" renditions of the songs. My 4 year old is just learning to explore the world of Pop music and she loves it. Obviously some of the words and phrases in the original music are not suited for little ones so... as a mom of a 4 and 2 year old I think it very appropriate that the words are changed. Good clean fun for early exposure to the world of rock. My 4 year old daughter gives it a big 2 thumbs up!"
1,OH NO!!!!,"Could you be anymore [silly] than to buy this cd?!??!!! Even the thought of creating something like this just makes me wanna smack whoever... tought of this! Do you think it really makes sense to have 3-6 year olds ""Singing"" songs by artists like Nelly, No Doubt, ect. Can you imagine? God this is like my worst nightmare, if the sound of lil kids singing isnt bad enough they gotta make em all sing mainstream songs ment for older people that arent even appropriate half the time! What ever happened to mickey mouse sing alongs??"
1,Servers are down,The PC and PS2 servers were shut down. Nothing will run. The game won't even allow single player story mode. This should be removed.
2,An MMORPG with no people.,"The problem with this product is not the game, but the platform.If you want to play this game, don't play it on PC or PS2. The PC/PS2 servers are merged and the servers are divided by continents, whereas the XBOX 360 version is much more populated (albeit with many idiots) and stretches beyond countries. Not only that, but the PC resolution and controls are weird. To access the menu, you hit the HOME key, and to attack with any weapon, you hit the DOWN arrow. Seriously.Aside from that, the game itself is tons of fun, if not flat and repetitive. This is a game for people who enjoy the ego maniacal pleasures of making a detailed character and buffing them up to level 150. :)"
2,This game is extremely annoying,I played Phantasy Star online for over ten years. i decided to give this one a try even though I heard plenty of complaints about it. The storyline mode is extremely annoying. It does so much pointless talking and there seems to be no way to skip it. If you die in this game you have to start all over from your last save point. That means you have to watch the annoying chat parts over and over again.The game play is very difficult. You have to keep changing weapons because they power down. The magic is total crap because you need to put it on a weapon. So to change magic you need to change weapons. Also very annoying.This is not a game for a beginner at all. I spent 7 dollars for the game and shipping and I think I over paid. I reached a lvl 29 and got bored.
3,Too Bad,"I picked up this product, even though the game is no longer supported for online fun. I picked up the DS game Phantasy Star Zero, and I picked up this one wanting to play it on the computer, too. Similar style to the DS one, and it's definitely easier to play with a controller. When I read why it shut down, the official announcement mentioned the 'future' of the Phantasy Star franchise. I can only hope it will be coming soon."
3,Good Game,"It's pretty fun, but not nearly as good as PSO. If you have the first PSU and play online, definately get the expanion, it's worth it. That said, the game gets stale pretty fast, new content doesn't come out much, and it involves a lot of grind. Overall, it's not worth a monthly fee, just go play Phantasy Star Online Blue Burst on a free server."
4,Good cookbook for breads.,I had this book years ago (when I was a stay-at-home mom) and it has the best pizza crust recipe I've ever had. Somewhere over the years I lost the book and now that I'm retired I wanted to make good homemade pizza again. I was so glad to find it online. The pizza crust is just as I remember it and it's so simple to make.
2,CONAIR DELUXE THERMAL SPA BATH MAT,"Mat was on time, But Not as Expected. I thought Thermal ment Heated Air Bubble from the Mat,& Plus The Mat Will Not Stick to Bath Tub Floor Surface. Realy thought The Thermal Bath Mat was a good BUY:"
4,Rushed,"I am a HUGE Sopranos fan. I have all the seasons except this one...While I did like this season, it was kinda disappointing to me. I have heard all the arguments about the end or whatever, but I just thought the whole thing was too rushed. They tried to throw too many new people and things at you. If anything, I would have wanted them to make two more seasons.This season was very dark and depressing, but it was good. Bittersweet.The end was just that, THE END. You can choose anyway you want to decide what happens to the fam."
1,Absolute Worst Sopranos season EVER !!,This was a NIGHTMARE from Start to Finish..Wow it would take me a long time to List Everything that was Wrong with this season...Did I mention the Ending ?? Wow what a Rip Off..So Many Things were Wrong !!! Tony Soprano came Off as a Fat Slob...Poorly written season..and that's saying something..
3,Time to end.,"Not too crazy with the final-ending, but I guess it was time to end the series. Would probably go to a ""Sopranos II"" type of story line, but there aren't any strong characters left."
3,Season 6 part 2,"This is the worst of all of the Sopranos sets, but a must have it you have the other years like I did."
3,broken disc,disc 1 broken - packaging was just fine. Please contact me to resolve if possible. I would like to hear from you.
5,AWESOME,"The writing and acting are just as good as ever. These episodes continue to take the viewer down that road where really sick pathetic bad guys sometimes do sensitive, kind, and humane things...If you like looking into the shadows and trying to figure out where the grey area ends, this dvd offers a lot of material for discourse and study. Great stuff!"
5,Sopranos DVD season 6 part 2,Loved it. it ends just fine for me. Not as I expected but no other ending could have been better.
5,Great Product,Great product works like magic and i would deffinitly recommend this to a friend or family member. Very great product
2,Sales,"Saprano's, season 6 in my opinion was not as suspenseful nor had the intensity of especially the first three! In fact season 6 seemed to ramble...... The ending really left something to be desired. It was like the producers ended it not knowing if they might write more."
4,Sopranos DVD,"I received the package in excellent shape. It was like new. Unfortunately I did not realize that you need an HD or Blu Ray player to play HD rated DVDs. I will be returning them. However, the service was fast and the response to my question about why they didn't work was very timely and courteous."
3,took us for a ride!!,"i sort of agree with the 1 star guy. we kept watching thinking it's going to get better . there'r in a slump. its hard to keep up with the great stories they've givin us in the past. i would have settled on them(chase and co.)taking another year or two to get it right. but for the time they made us wait (almost two years a piece for the last three seasons.)and not get it back on track. but they didn't.unexceptable! they should at least not charge as much for the inferior seaons. anything over 35$ is absurd. the way i would have changed or fixed the show would be TO HAVE TONY , UNCLE JUNE,MEADOW, AND PAULY ...(fade to black. __________________ Directed by David Chase.................................................."
3,Shipping,Make sure you know how long this will take to get and the method of shipping you have requested
3,Review of Sopranos Season 6 part 2,"My iten arrived on time and was purchased for a good price (new) However once the DVD collection was opened I found that 3 of the plastic ""disk holders"" had come loose and the fell to the floor. This item was purchased as a gift for someone and it was rather disturbing to have them open it and and watch half of the contents drop to the floor."
1,stink,i thought the sopranos season 6 part 1 and 2 stinked..the worse sopranos of all of them and I have them all. That stupid ending at the restaurant meadow running to the shop and it ends..What??????????????????
4,Che peccato...,"It's not the best series of episodes from the whole series, but as a huge fan of the show, it gave me great pleasure to watch these last installments. I also love the fact that, in true Sopranos tradition, the end didn't succumb to cheap cliff-hanger tactics. It ended as all episodes did: with some unresolved issues and no schmaltzy morals."
5,"Completes a ""television era"" of entertainment!","This completes my Soprano's series and it was a great program from the beginning. It always left you ""anticipating"" the next season. I will say that the very last episodes were somewhat disappointing when compared with the over-all drama of the entire series. It was well worth it though!"
4,A little bit short.,"For this Sopranos fan, Season Six, part 2 was hightly entertaining and well made but failed to wrap up an entire 10-year series. As long time fans already know, this season was another in the Sopranos saga and in and of itself, was a very good continuation of the format from the previous seasons. However, a great deal of previous plot lines were left hanging in the balance and as most fans can attest, the final scene of the final episode was very much of a let-down. Season Six, part 2 : A great season on its own, but as a series finale, somewhat disappointing!"
2,Quite Dissapointing...,"I had heard that the last season left a lot to be desired and I have to agree whole heartedly. I was very dissatified with the entire season...if you haven't seen it yet, you are not missing anything."
3,SAD IT'S OVER,NOT AS GOOD AS OTHER SEASONS AND A BIT DISSAPOINTED ON HOW IT FINISHED.SAD TO SEE A GREAT SHOW END.
4,9 episodes on FOUR discs?!?!,"This is a great DVD set, but why put 9 episodes on four discs? The previous seasons were 13 episodes on four discs. That was four episodes on disc 1 and three episodes on discs 2-4. So, on this set, why couldn't HBO put 3 episodes per disc? This would reduce the number of discs to three discs rather than four and would therefore, reduce the price! Oh, I think I know why! HBO wants to charge the same amount, that's why! While the content on this DVD is great, I give it 4 stars rather than 5 because HBO is trying to rip us off."
2,My all -time favorite program!!!,"I will shed more than a tear when this is over (for me, watching it as I do only on DVD here in my home town)Really fabulous series!"
1,The ending?!?!?!?,Dont think I need to get into the ending too much. I wish it would have been better. Those who bought the entire season should be given the movie for free when it comes out!
5,The Most Proper Finale To An Unpredictable Series,"How did mot people really expect this to end??? People awaiting a Scorsese-like ending should take a deep breath, and realize this isn't Goodfellas....I believe this is exactly how this series should have come to an end, and quite fitting if you watch from Season 1 to the end. Cheers to a classic mobster series with humanity, which these sociopaths show in their inhuman way"
5,Sopranos RULE!!!!,I loved this entire Season...although the ending left a lot to be desired. I am hoping the writters left this open for a possible comeback.I have the entire Sopranos Collection and I am never dissappointed.
4,"The Sopranos, Season 6, Part 2","I liked the show very much, really didn't expect this ending. Did they leave it open for a comeback??? Who Knows!!!"
5,dont stop believin,"I finally have the complete set. I have watched a few episodes of this set and am taking my sweet time as the end is near. Quality and suspense of these episodes has been excellent. This show defines what television programming should be. My only regret about this set is that it lacks bonus materials. I wish they had put more on it, farewell tributes, cast interviews or something since it is the last season. If they make a boxed collectors set then hopefully more bonus features will be included on that."
5,Easy to clean and use.,"My daughter recently acquired 5 Coturnix Quail which she keeps as pets in a large cage. This watering tray fits nicely on a large mason jar and is easy to clean. My only advice would be to set the tray up on something to keep it away from any cage bedding if you're going to use it in a cage. The quail have a habit of kicking their bedding into the water, which makes the water more like mud. If it's up on a wooden block or similar that greatly minimizes the problem. The quail are quite adept at reaching their water even when it's a few inches off the floor."
4,Bloody Awesome Album,"When a childhood buddy recommended this album to me I knew it couldn't miss. Three Japanese girls singing street punk is truely exciting by all means. Thug Murder isn't one of those poser punk bands living in a garage saying whatever will sell them a cd. These lovelys earn their beer money with arse kicking songs that hype you up like true punks is suppose to. Make your well deserved four clics on the mouse and purchase the bloody cd now, you won't regret it....."
4,"Barely five foot, Japanese trio taking it to the Street!","This female Japanesse trio sound tougher than railroad spikes. The vocals are all in english although it's somtimes hard to make them out. A lyric sheet is included so you'll bealbe to figure out what their saying, but some of it still won't make sence. Yet, I still find my self singing along to songs like ""Calling"", ""13th Round"", ""Dice"", ""Restart"", ""Double Fisted"" and thier cover of ""I Fought the Law"". Thug Murder play better street punk than half their American counter parts."
4,Great Entertainment,"by David WilbanksWilliam Meikle is a talented storyteller who'll keep you turning pages, with ISLAND LIFE's rousing narrative, in order to find out what happens next to his sympathetic characters. And he is equally skilled at producing smiles or dread in a reader (be wary halfway through this book if you're afraid of heights!).The story takes place on a foggy Scottish island where ancient evil erupts into the inhabitants slow-paced lives. Murders and disappearances perplex the characters who find out to their horror that they're dealing with terrible creatures and powers beyond imagining.Any novel that contains short chapters from the dog's point of view earns extra points with me. If this type of story sounds appealing, grab it. You're in capable hands."
1,Typical Michelin,"As pointed out in the other review, Michelin books are organized alphabetically. While they may be good for laying out a web site they are frustrating and inefficient to use to plan a trip. Unless you travel alphabetically."
3,More paranoid than informative,This book was interesting but not overly informative. Bruce could have fit the actual useful information into about 10 pages. It also left me with the feeling that Bruce is more than a little paranoid. Yes I believe in the unseen and the importance of psychic self-defense but this book was well on it's way to sitting in the basement with a tinfoil hat on paranoid. Even paranormal subjects need to be approached rationally. I suggest looking else-where for information on this subject.
1,Strange,"Ok I can make this real easy for a potential buyer of this book. The whole premise is NEGS in the ground chasing after you looking for a weak point to get into your body. The good thing to know is they can't travel very fast and can't pass through,over or under running water.Many times the author states using a garden hose with the water turned on and carry a possessed person over the hose to break the connection. This is constantly repeated throughout the book.Keanu Reeves could of used this in the movie""Constantine"" would of saved hemself alot of pain."
4,Best of the pre-Warner years...,"Murmur is REM Mark 1 at their very best. It sounds like they'd been recording together for years and this sombre, reflective album is seamless and assured. Not for everyone, and it takes a few plays, but Perfect Circle and We Walk rank among the band's greatest tracks."
5,This is your life.,"You're 15 years old. Hanging out, drinking beer in some deserted parking lot, when someone puts this tape in. By the time you hit ""Shaking Through"" you realize that nothing will ever quite sound the same again. This has been the soundtrack of my life. It carried me through high school, college, my first girlfriend, my first boyfriend, and all the weirdness in between. Oddly, it still sounds as amazing today as it did that first time almost fifteen years ago..."
2,"LANGUAGE, MR. STIPE","I DO NOT LIKE GANGSTER RAP. IF I WANTED A 2 LIVE CREW ALBUM (UNCENSORED!!!!), I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT ONE. MICHAEL STIPE'S CURSING ON HERE IS NOT SOMETHING I LIKE. I BOUGHT THIS ALBUM BECAUSE I ENJOYED THE (GOOD) SONG 'STAND IN THE PLACE WHERE YOU LIVE',,, THIS ALBUM IS NOTHING LIKE THAT.THIS ALBUM IS AGRESSIVE AND NOT AT ALL LIKE THE B-52s (LOVE SHACK) WHO ARE ALSO FROM GEORGIA."
3,Not a bad first CD opener for REM,"This CD has some good songs, and strong music beats. It shows the listener be he or she a fan or a music buff the future of REM. They get better with each album they produce. Perfect Circle was my song pick for this album."
3,"Good album, but overrated","There is no doubt that ""Murmur"" is a quality effort. ""Radio Free Europe"" and ""Talk About the Passion"" are the two most talked- up tracks from this. But the idea that VH1 would rank this album in the Top 100 of all time is rediculous. It is true that R.E.M. has/had a sound all their own, and I have collected most of their recordings over the years. But the idea that this record stacks up to the likes of ""Synchronicity"" by the Police or ""The Joshua Tree"" by U2 is laughable. It seems like this record gets much attention because it was the first released by this Athens, Georgia quartet."
3,Maybe It's Just Me,"I don't think I've ever seen a bad review of this album. I just don't get it. Admittedly, I ignored it when it came out, mistakenly thinking R.E.M. was just another 80's Techno band that would fade away. I finally purchased it in the late 90's, after R.E.M. conquered the world. ""Talk About The Passion"" and ""Perfect Circle"" are top notch, but, for the most part, most of these songs wouldn't have made the cut on any other R.E.M. album."
2,We all have one...,"I know Murmur's listed in many a ""best album of the 80's"" list, if not ""best ever,"" I know it was a breakthrough for a particularly progressive sound, I know people worship at the temple of Michael Stipe, but I HATE this album. We've all got one - that album that everyone tells you is brilliant, but does absolutely nothing for you. This is mine, an album that provokes near violent reactions in me (""Radio Free Europe"" excluded). Stipe to me has a snoozy, self-loving vocal ability that borders on pompousity often, and the production is soporific at best, full of its own low-fi eagerness. Songs like ""Moral Kiosk"" are preachy, poorly constructed, and don't age well - this song sounds like it was made in the early 80's by people who thought they were revolutionary. They may have been right - now, it only recalls 100 more interesting albums that came after its release."
1,If you have money to burn...,"I love REM but this just wasn't worth the money. Don't get me wrong I love their music and I suppose I wanted to ""collect them all"" but this changed my mind about that idea. I'm actually upset that saved up for this. Forget about this import and just save your money for the next album."
5,Epiphany!,"This album would have been a great debut for any band at any time, but coming as it did in the MTV infested wasteland that was pop music in 1983, it was an epic achievement. Moreover, Murmur has stood the test of time. Radio Free Europe was and is an anthem for alternative/indy music, but each song is incredibly well crafted (especially considering the band's somewhat limited range at that point in their career). Buy it and you'll have trouble listening to anything else for weeks."
4,the father of alternative rock...,"if you are an R.E.M. fan and you don't have this CD, then you are missing something... The only way you can get the lyrics is to look them up in the internet. But it is just what makes it great! Mistery! Try Reckoning too, which I would say is a 5 star album..."
5,Worth every penny plus...,"What keeps bringing me back to R.E.M.'s ""Murmur"" is that I can still discover something new each time I listen. Whether it's some noise buried deep in the mix, or a new interpretation of a lyric, there's always something. For longtime fans of the disc, I strongly recommend Mobile Fidelity's Gold Disc. The reproduction from the original masters is far superior to the regular discs - especially in the bass and drums. Pick this one up and you'll enjoy rediscovering a favorite all over again."
5,Spectacular Remix,"(Re)discover this album, one of rock's finest, in a nicely remixed package. Download this, plug in your best set of earphones and just enjoy. I've become a big fan of digital downloads, as I could care less about packaging, etc. and this is one of the best (re)discoveries a discerning listener could hope to find. The live half encapsulates the joyful energy of these guys, but doesn't quite compare to the beauty of the first disc/half. The excellent remix of the first disc/half however, is worth the price alone. No need to complain about the high cost like the folks who purchased the CD- just download. Very highly recommended.Up the stairs, to the landing, up the stairs and to the hall, oh ho ho."
5,"Awesome is not a word to overuse, but it fits","Late May, 1983. I've just returned home from college for the last time. I've left behind my first love and dozens of irreplaceable friends. I feel lost. Then, on the radio, there is music in which my exact emotion of the moment is realized. It is so beautiful it hurts. A lyric repeats: ""Did we miss anything? Did we miss anything?"" I cry.It still makes me cry."
5,Great!,"I had purchased the album on vinyl back in 1983. I hadn't listened to it for some time, and just recently got around to getting it on CD. It was like listening to it and discovering it's greatness for the first time again. It's a truely beautiful album that really rocks as well. I've always been enchanted with Peter Buck's guitar playing on this album and ""Reckoning"" - it's kind of an anti-grunge style - no noisy power chords or solos - just shimmering, folky strumming and picking. This, along with Stipe's hushed, slurred vocals, Berry's steady drumming, and Mill's melodic bass playing (which is reminiscent in it's role in R.E.M. s songs to Paul McCartney' s bass lines in the Beatle's music) create a wonderful, unique sound. The melodies and hooks are gorgeous - ""Pilgrimage"", ""Talk About the Passion"", ""Perfect Circle"", ""Shaking Through"" being some of the most obvious examples. A classic that I will be listening to 20 years from now."
5,Very Pleased,It came in a timely manner. It was a better stick than what I thought it was going to be. I didn't know that when you turn the stick around it has graduations on the back for calculating heights. Nice product. I'm glad I got it.
2,Ok,Feels flimsy and buttons stick. an old tape measure stapled to a stick might be nicer then this. I'm now convinced that extruded aluminum surveying equipment shouldn't bought.
5,I've seen how this book can help,"As a clinical social worker and psychotherapist at a large university hospital, I have found this book to be an extremely powerful healing tool for several clients who are in cancer treatment. In fact, the insights and information Dr. Geffen provides can be hugely beneficial not only to people dealing with cancer or another serious illness, but to anyone looking for a compassionate and effective approach to life's challenges. Professionally and personally, I agree completely with the endorsement on the cover from Joan Borysenko, PhD: ""This is the best book ever written for people with cancer and those who love them."""
2,Gangsta King,"Given the subject matter, one could hardly expect a high budget production but what Gangsta King delivers is little more than a modern day blaxploitation docu-flick. Understandably Greg ""Batman"" Davis is seeking to portray Raymond Washington in a favorable light but putting it out that Raymond was totally against guns and never carried one is taking it abit far. Contrary to legend, the crips were violent from day one as were the L.A. gangs which pre-dated their emergence. The most interesting thing about this documentary is Batman's photographs beyond that this is one documentary you would be best served renting or borrowing from the library. The historical recreations of past events is terrible due to poor acting and this sums up the rest of the video. Low budget, low quality, low class."
3,KEEP IT REAL BATMAN,I ENJOYED GANGSTA KING THE INTERVIEW WITH GREGG BATMAN WAS NOT EXCLUSIVE .I ORDER THE DVD FOR MY 11 YEAR OLD SON. MY SON MALCOM WANTED TO SEE HIS FATHER GREGG BATMAN DAVIS.GREGG REQUESTED A DNA TEST WHEN OUR SON WAS 2 YEARS OLD THE TEST WAS POSTIVE . I FEEL GREGG BATMAN DAVIS DID NOT TELL ALL THE TRUE FACTS ABOUT HIS LIFE.
4,Good,The product was delivered within a few business days and the seller communicated through email to ensure quality service. My item looked as expected and I was pleased overall.
4,would buy again,"Quality product, however remanufactored doesn't appear in the title description. Nonetheless it is like new and is happily installed on my classic rambler."
1,Ma per favore...,"E ora? Questo brano è la copia sputata di Jaded. Ripigliatevi, cari Aerosmith, così proprio non va. Cosa ci dobbiamo aspettare a breve? Un duetto con Britney Spears?"
1,"EVERYTHING WILL""C "" ALRIGHT","LOOK THESE BRANDS CAME OUT WITH ANOTHER ALBUM. YOU SLOBS DON'T QUIT. DENVERLANE, CRENSHAW MAFIA, IFG, BRIMS, QUEEN ST, VAN NESS GANSTAS, KILLABRAND. NATIONWIDE RIP RIDE"
3,Maybe too basic for the serious student of the bible,"Lots of big pictures and some interesting factoids, but surprisingly light weight for its lineage (Collegeville Press). Has not proven to be the resource I was looking for, but a nice ""bathroom"" book."
2,Mr.,"I Like the music of TD. But this CD is only a reproduction of the original and the ""additional traks"" (more as 1) is only 1 additional track, known from other compilations. Nothing news."
2,Not that great,"Lame. Patterson's other works are much better. This seemed rushed, full of holes. The Amtrak scene was terrible. The author should have taken Amtrak so he would know what he was writing about. I was disappointed."
4,Exciting,"I'm pretty surprised at the all the differences in the reviews of this book. If you like Patterson at all, what's not to like here? The pacing is fast, I really enjoyed the back-and-forth between first and third person narratives (first person DOES take away much of the suspence, after all), I had no clue as to who-dun-it, and as for the ending that so many seem to be bothered by ... I was blown away. Normally I would find an ending such as this bothersome but not this time. Somehow I can't think of a more appropriate way to close this book. The villain in ""Roses Are Red"" is so completely evil as to be almost indestructable, and this is the sense I was left with."
2,Not Patterson's best work by a long shot.,"I have read several of his books, they have all been better than this one. The ending seems to me that he figured, ""Well, I've written enough to sell a book, I'll end it right now."" One of those ""...and then I woke up"" endings."
4,Alex Cross is Better than Ever,"""Roses are Red"" by James Patterson gives us a better-than-ever Alex Cross. If you like the series, you'll love this book. Interesting plot, great characters, great dialogue."
3,Probaly Alex Cross's Worst.,"Roses Are Red the new thriller by James Patterson is quarenteed to creep out, and terrify first or second time readers. But if you have read more than 10 of his it will be un suspenceful and a little dull.I am Beggining to think that James Patterson is actually a bad writer, because he seems to write the same stories over and over. This one is like he put Kiss The Girls, Jack And Jill, Cat And Mouse and Pop Goes The Weasel in a blender and came out with this one."
1,What the hell?,"I've been a big fan of books since I was a kid forced to read them when I was in school. Ironic as that statement sounded, i do like books. I also like movies. I watched Kiss the Girls and Along came a Spider. I figured the plot seems out of the ordinary and the protagonist has the intellect of Da Vinci, the books would be great, too. I picked up a copy of Roses are Red and thought, ""What the hell?"" The storyline was weak and it was poorly written. Nothing was as fanciful as I thought it would have been. When he finds out who the antagonists are, it was nothing like I would have imagined it. It seemed like he found them out by imagining out in his head. Most writers would put description of the clues their heroes found. This one didn't. I was pretty upset by this book. I'm going to try another one later, but for now, one Patterson novel seems enough for me."
2,Bogus ending,"While I generally enjoy Patterson, Roses are Red was disappointing. While a twist at the end is expected, Patterson really cheats the reader. As there are people who may read reviews prior to buying the book, I won't write more.The book was written on par with other Patterson novels and other than the disappointing ending it was a decent read and what I've come to expect from him."
3,Alex Cross has had better days!,"As much as I enjoy all of the Alex Cross series, I found this particular book to drag on a bit. I must admit though that the ending was a total surprise and I do look forward to reading Patterson's next novel, Violets are Blue. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the read, but Patterson has had better."
3,Ridiculous,"I enjoyed this novel for its characterization, hence the three stars I assigned it. However, Patterson needs to go back and re-read Agatha Christie to learn to prepare his readers for a logical, plausible ending. Really! The ending made no sense. It was as though the author was already focusing his attention on a sequel. That may be fine for everyone familiar with Patterson's other novels, but this was my first, and I do not feel that I was rewarded for my emotional investment in the book."
2,Disappointing until the last line,"I am trying to read the series in order, and this is the first one out of 6 that was disappointing. I thought it was sloppy. If the so called Mastermind knew what Alex Cross looked like, why would Alex then go and try to work in the hospital where the Mastermind was a patient. Of course he would see Cross and begin to run or cover his tracks. Dumb!!!! Yes the last line was a shocker, but seriously, that was the only part that sparked my interest. As far as Alex's personal life....what a mess! I will continue to read the series, but I hope this one was just a bump in the road."
4,Whoa...another great read from Patterson!,"This one's over the top! The ending (no spoiler here) will absolutely guarantee your immediate purchase of the next Alex Cross book. I was horribly saddened by ""Christine's"" inability to function again after the year of kidnapping. I thought initially she was a gutsy lady, but she disappointed me. I will say I'm terribly pleased with the way Patterson writes female characters. He's got it down...they're tough, but loving, sweet, kind and generous and they can be big shots in their own professions. Susan Isaacs writes great female characters and so does Patterson. Unfortunately, many mystery writers are unable to grasp female characters without making them self-centered [...]. I've actually stopped reading Kellerman, White and Cornwell because I could no longer stomach their female characters. ROSES ARE RED is a great ride...I simply loved it, can't wait for the next one."
4,Not the best one written but pure Alex Cross,"This book took me 5 hours to read. I could not put it down. Patterson really makes you sympathize with Alex Cross and his loss of Chrsitine.This is one of the few books that I had no idea who the killer is and keeps it open for a sequel (we can hope). I really enjoy Alex Cross and hopefully he'll find a woman one day that can stay with him. If Alex can't, maybe Sampson can!"
3,"I'm a big Alex Cross fan, but...","I give the book a generous three-star rating because the writing, right up to the final chapter, is up to Patterson's usual high standard. However, the ending has an almost farcical, tacked-on-at-the- last-minute feel that was profoundly disappointing and unrealistic to me. Sorry, but this one just doesn't do it for me. Suspension of disbelief is totally lost in the last chapter. I hope Mr. Patterson gets back to his old standard in his next Alex Cross novel, because I've enjoyed them all up to now."
1,Dreadful!,"As a long time Patterson fan, I'm convinced this book was written in a week's time. Sloppy character development, trite language, and a ridiculous ending. You can just do so much with the noble Alex Cross and his precocious children before they start to wear thin. The characters may have different names, but the story is same old, same old. It's almost as if Patterson picks the crime and the names of the characters out of a hat and then attempts to develop a plot.It appears that Mr. Patterson is resting on some very old laurels and no longer feels the need to engage his readers. It might be time for Alex Cross to consider early retirement to a condo on the beach.My only solace is that I received this book free from a book club. Rather than spend YOUR money, donate it to a worthy cause instead. Ugh!"
2,Not the Old Patterson,"I have been an avid fan of James Patterson for years and have read, or rather, listened, to most of his books. After reading POP GOES THE WEASEL I couldn't wait to read his next book. Thinking that CRADLE AND ALL was the natural title for its sequel I was quite disapointed to find out that the book totally deviated away from Alex Cross and his normal thrillers. Then I was elated to find that Alex was back in ROSES ARE RED and couldn't wait to get my hands on it. I hate to say this but this book reads like one written by an amateurist James Patterson. The plot is not intense, the language school like and the suspence weaker then the punch line of a poorly told joke. Also, the person reading this version left much to be desired in the way of entertainment. So often it is the reader that makes the book, but this edition leaves much to be desired in both the reader and content. Sorry, Mr. Patterson, but you left an ardent admirer down with this one!"
2,Much ado about nothing....,"This was my first experience reading James Patterson and his protagonist, Alex Cross. I had to try to grasp some of the characters which had figured in previous Cross novels. it was a fast read because of the short chapters, some a little longer than a few paragraphs. The ending seemed rushed with another murder and an unsatisfactory twist in the last chapter. This was just a vacation read, but I felt baffled and cheated when all was done!"
2,predictable,This is the fourth book I've read by James Patterson and the last. I was okay with it up until the last quarter of the book when it became a typical ending for him. His writing is just too predictable and Alex Cross' kids CANNOT be that perfect.
1,Patterson mails this one in,"I've been a Patterson fan from Day one. I have read all of his work to date but ""Roses are Red"" is just a stinker. The story line has great possibilities but goes nowhere. There is absolutely no resolution in any of the twists and turns of the story. Though you eventually find out who the murderer is, he is still at large at books end. Patterson will have to pony up a better story next time or fans will be jumping ship bigtime."
2,These roses are wilted.,"I'm a Patterson fan, but didn't find this to be one of his better books. The book had a promising start, but never delivered."
2,Not Much Effort,"Patterson's latest book, ROSES ARE RED, is a huge disappointment to me. It falls far short of his previous books. Very little character development, very little plot development. Jim should be ashamed to push such a simple story line and cheap ending on his readers. Too bad. This is the last time I will buy one of his book in hard cover. I'll wait for the garage sale, 50 cents, copy in paperback. I won't be burned twice."
3,Enjoying James Patterson,"I have read almost all of Mr. Patterson's books and have enjoyed them. I was a little disappointed in this one. I felt like it lacked three little words at the end of the story...to be continued. I really do not like to read to be continued stories until the next installment is out. If I like the book, I want to be able to go to the next one right away. If Mr. Patterson's intentions were not to make this a two-parter, then I was left with a ""and then..."" feeling."
1,Roses Are Red Not Patterson's Best,"I have just recently begun to read James Patterson's Alex Cross stories and loved ""Pop Goes The Weasel"". I couldn't wait to read ""Roses Are Red"". Shortly into the second chapter I realized this book would not be worth my anticipation. Fast paced is an appropriate term here, the writing is rather sketchy, the chapters short, the characters and plot underdeveloped. Mr. Patterson wasted no time in getting this book to his readers, perhaps more time spent on it's content would have been appropriate."
4,James Patterson does it again,"In ""Rose are Red"" James Patterson once again crafts a story that is fast paced and exciting. The twists are always there with Patterson and this book is no different. I found that Patterson what trying to hard to create some personal relationship story lines here that really did not fit very well with the story. Again a fast read at 4 hours, and the last few lines will have you on the edge of your seat for the Next Cross Novel! Over all well worth the short reading time."
3,What Happened?!,I am an avid James Patterson fan. I was totally shocked and disappointed at the way this book ended. It was as though James Patterson just got tired of writing the story and just quit and let it be published. It reminded me of reading Gone with the Wind and wondering just why I bothered reading just a dynamic book with a stupid ending. I trully hope that this isn't a turn for the worse in his writing style.
1,What happened ?,"I have to say that I was extremely disappointed at the end of this book. Far from being a surprise twist at the end, it felt more like Mr Patterson was struggling to meet a deadline and had run out of ideas for the bad guy. So, at the end of the book, nothing ties in, the motive isn't clear and its inconsistent with the other Alex Cross novels. Without tying up the loose ends in Rose are Red I wonder how a sequel would work, assuming the fans of the Alex Cross series don't give up after this one.Up until the last chapter it was fairly decent, not his best work but good all the same. However the last chapter ruined the whole book and left the impression that it was poorly thought out and a very sloppy ending. Sorry !"
3,In the end it feels manipulated.........,"Roses are Red is a fast paced tale of serial murder and a personal vendetta. Alex Cross is called upon during his son's christening to help track down a family's murderer that occurs in connection with a bank robbery. Alex Cross feels a need to assist with the investigation. This in effect destroys his relationship with the mother of his son, Christine(who was kidnapped for a year in a previous novle).As Alex follows the trail of the criminal who calls himself the Mastermind, the action is non-stop and clues seem to be revealed, yet nothing seems to be leading in the right direction. With each new discovery, Alex seems to be getting closer and yet, in the very end, there is a distinctly flat feel to the inconclusive end. Patterson does a remarkable job in creating this ""bad guy"", but when the identity is revealed it feels manipulated. James Patterson has written many terrific books, this one however is not one of his best."
2,Doesn't Make the Cut,"I found this book to be disappointing. It just didn't live up to the level that James Patterson has established for himself. The book was an easy read, and held my interest. Which is the worst part, because I invested a few hours to read the book and I was enjoying untill the ending just ruined everthing. Just when you thought you knew who the ""mastermind"" was Patterson threw at you a new ""mastermind"". When you finally found out who the villian was it was just disappointing and unbelievable. I hope Patterson's next book is better than this one."
2,What a disappointment!,"A thick book but a quick read without much 'meat'. I was very excited to get this book and ended up completely disappointed in Alex Cross, his kids, his nana, his ex and his new lady-love. Not a whole lot of interesting stuff going on in this story, folks."
1,One of the worst of its kind.,"Yuck. Terrible. Two and three-page chapters, one dimensional characters, senseless plot, serial killer with no apparent motive, etc. I've read all the books in the Harry Bosch and Jack Reacher series and was looking for something new, but I don't even know how this got published."
5,I can't wait to read the next book,This is the 1st James Patterson Book I have read and it was WONDERFUL! I could have read the whole book in a day (and trust me that would hav been rare). I could not stop reading it.... could not put it down. Every free moment I got at work I picked up my book.
4,Page Turner...Don't Read to Fall Asleep!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book - I love that the chapters are so short. It is easy to say, ""Just one more chapter..."" and find yourself 50 pages down the road because he left you wanting more after that ""one more chapter"". I thought it was sneaky that they printed the first few chapters of ""Violets are Blue"" at the end of ""Roses are Red"" ....after reading them I had to run out and buy the hard cover of ""Violets..."" which I normally don't do! I read that in a day, too...what's next? ""Sugar is Sweet""?"
3,The trouble with book series...,"Sooner or later, in the life of every series, the need to publish a book on time seems to outweigh the author's ability to produce. That's when you get a book with an unfinished or rote plot, very big fonts, and a new chapter every 2 pages (and lots of white apce in between). This book is very readable, but there's not much to it."
4,"Not his best, but not bad","I'm a huge James Patterson fan and was looking forward to his new book. This book was the same fast paced, page turning book that Patterson always writes, but it wasn't up to par with ""Kiss the Girls"" or ""Cat and Mouse"". But if your a Patterson fan it's a must read. Hopefully, in the next book he'll back to true form."
1,God...why did I ever read this book?,"I think Patterson should simply stop writing books and save us the time..I read this book and I was soo angry with my self for reading such a idiotic story it ruined my whole day...Here there is a guy called Mastermind who can be anyone ... with a very weak reasoning surely patterson could ve find a better mastermind than what was mentioned in the last page..actually I thought i was NANA MAMA..it would ve made more sense..if u wanna read some murder mysteries which makes any sense read some hercule poirot stories like ""Murder of the roger ackroyd""..this novel deserves to be taken out of the shops..I wonder how come they advertise this as a no.1 bestseller."
2,Disappointed,"I have read every book James Paterson has written, and I anxiously await each new one. It seems Mr. Paterson is writing books to fulfill a contarctual obligation, rather than to generate thrillers like Kiss The Girls & Along Came A Spider. The plot is superfluous, empty, and very sophmoric. What happened to the Alex Cross of earlier books, where the challenges were real and intense. Please don't write junk and expect your readers to buy it. Loyalty goes just so far."
5,Another great Alex Cross novel,"I look forward to James Patterson books. They are always a great way to ""get away"". I have read all of the Alex Cross novels and they never disappoint. You keep up to date on his life, as well as each new murder mystery. Keeps you guessing and on your toes up until the end. Hooray for James Patterson for giving us yet another good book."
1,Disappointing,"This was a book I was looking forward to reading. I thought after Pop Goes The Weasel James Paterson would come to his senses and write a book that did not reach such an obscure story line. Boy, was I wrong. Bab enough Christine is in Bermuda for a year and has a baby, Roses Are Red goes beyond that. When I read the last sentence I thought I had missed something. I actually went back and scaned it again to see the missing clues. There were none. My conclusion is James Paterson could not find an ending to his rambling novel, ergo the last paragraph. I have purchased my last book authored by him. You (AOL) should be giving this book away, not offering a 40% discount. It is truly not worth it."
3,Just another Alex Cross book,"The book is a quick read, and that is the best I can say for it. As always, Patterson's plot is convoluted. Usually the twists and turns come together to make an interesting whole, but this book has major plot lines left hanging."
2,Roses are Red,"Not James Patterson's best. This book was a bit of a let down compared to his others. Poor start, had some holes, but picks up at the end. Some of the story just had no reason to be there. What was that? I finished it because I started it and wanted to know if ANTTHING would happen. Hope the next one is better than this one. Read if you have nothing else."
3,"Patterson's ""Roses"" A Bit Thorny","James Patterson has lost his mystery and entered the world of predictable in his new novel ""Roses Are Red."" The Plot seems too contrived, the ending predictable, and the book reads as though Patterson was in a rush to meet his publisher's deadline. Alex Cross, the main character of most of Patterson's novel's, has lost his luster, and proves to be dull. While the ending of ""Roses Are Red"" is supposed to provide shock, it does little more than pinch. As an avid Patterson reader, I can only assume that Patterson tired of writing successful Alex Cross novels, and needed to find a different garden path."
3,DO NOT read the last page first!,"If you read the last page first you will spend the whole book looking for the clues to the identity of the archvillain - and there aren't any!! If Patterson keeps going like this, someday he'll write a book where his grandmother turns out to be a killer!I assumed his next book would be the sequel, but it turns out to be about an entirely different character. Maybe Patterson painted himself into a corner by finishing off Roses are Red in a hurry with the surprise identification of the villain - and now can't figure out a plausible back story for the character so he can write the next book!Regardless of the stupid ending, I give it three stars because I actually DO like reading about Alex Cross and his rather snakebit life, and it was a fun and easy read (got through it in about four hours). Maybe I'm being charitable because I didn't buy it - got it at the library."
3,"Great attempt, crappy execution","This book had the potential for his usual greatness...BUT... it should have been completed. The ending was nothing more than the beginning of his next book. (I am not happy about the trend from popular authors to serialize their works. Fine. WARN US!) This is as incomplete a book as Black Notice was without The Last Precinct (Patricia Cornwell). The ending here was AWFUL. The book itself was good. Very disappointing that we, the faithful fan, should have to cough up [...] bucks for something that isn't done cooking yet. Put this thing back in the oven. It just ain't done yet."
4,James Patterson is back with a vengence . . . . .,Roses are Red is an outstanding return for James Patterson. If you are an Alex Cross fan you will look this book. As a true James Patterson fan this book was definitely a breath of fresh air. I read it in one day. Alex Cross is back and still in effect. There is a new psychopath killer in town and he goes by the name of the Mastermind. The Mastermind plans a series of bank and insurance companies robberies while in the meantime he takes some hostages life while on his journey. Alex Cross just coming off of the Weasel case dives into this case at the risk of losing his girlfriend (Christina) and new son (Alex). James Patterson marvels you with his twists and turn and a ending that will leaving your thriving for more. This book is a must read.
1,It didn't end!,"I was recently in London and bought Roses are Red for my evening reading. I am a fan of James Patterson. The book was a real page turner right up until the last two chapters. In fact, after the last chapter I turned the page thinking I had stuck two or three pages together. I think Mr. Patterson got tired and just stopped writing. The book doesnt end. It just stops. Thus, the story is simply awful."
5,Roses are Red,One of my authors and favorite character. I started the Violets are Blue and realized that it was the continued from Roses are Red.
3,Alex Cross,"Pretty Good read, enjoyable, quick and entertaining. I haven't gotten to read Patterson for some time, so i am catching back up on the Cross novels from beginning to current."
2,Disappointing,I always look forward to the new James Patterson...this was a pure disappointment. Mr. Patterson gives the appearance that he was behind in his deadline and just had to get something out.
5,Excellent!,Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. I LOVED this book. I love all of the Alex Cross books. I was not disappointed. Thanks for the good read!
2,Is that all there is?,"Doesn't an author owe us a beginning, middle and ending to a story? If so, Patterson doesn't deliver. What a strange and disappointing ending to a book that moved well, albeit mimicking past Patterson plots. Should we not want to purchase the next Patterson/Cross based solely on its merits and not on the fact that we need closure to Roses are Red? This game is not being played fairly, and I doubt I will purchase the ""must have sequel"" to this one. Have you no allegiance to your fans, Mr. Patterson. We're the ones who got you to where you are!"
2,you've got to be kidding....,What a disappointment....I've faithfully read every James Patterson book and especially love the Alex Cross books...but this one was a real let down. Don't read the last page...it will spoil everything. I am still wondering...what will happen next????
5,"Great book, recommend to all Alex Cross fans!","A book that will keep you guessing until the very end! Very suspenseful, Even at the end you still want more but we will have to wait untl the next book! A great book to read!"
1,Roses are REDiculous,"This book was horrible. I was read it in about a day, and the plot was gripping but nothing special. Nothing was challenging about the read, either. What truly ruined the book was the extremely predictable and unexplained ending. The murderer was too obvious that I immediately dismissed the possibility that he could be the Mastermind. I was very disappointed. Don't waste your money on this book."
1,Lousy,"I didn't finish it. Patterson's search for ever-more-horrible villans makes these books more horror stories than detective novels.There is very little reality: criminals can't act like Patterson's bad guys because they need to sleep, need cash, can't anticipate every eventuality, ... His criminals aren't.Also, the number of cops who have had 2 partners killed in succession is zero, much less partners who were lovers.Label it FBI-wet-dream fantasy, but not detective fiction."
4,Another Patterson Thriller,"Quick read, shock ending ~ you definetly don't see this ending coming, but I guess thats why I love Pattersons novels. Another great book in the Alex Cross series - onto Violets Are Blue!"
3,Not Patterson's Best,"I have been a fan of James Patterson's ""Alex Cross"" novels since Along Came a Spider and I usually enjoy them. This book, however, was a little disapointing. There are several large red herrings as to who the criminal known as the Mastermind really is and Patterson throws the reader a bone and shows who the Mastermind is in the next to last sentence of the book. Of course, the criminal is still at large and James Patterson will probably get a fat advance for the next book.Another bother is the love life of Alex Cross. So far, two of his women have died, one was a criminal and two were victims of the men Cross was after. I may have missed a couple too. Does anyone REALLY have that much bad luck with women?"
2,Roses Are Red,"Typical Alex Cross in what we've come to expect - ridiculously overreaching genius unkillable (main) bad guy who can not be touched except by Alex. The Author seems to thrill in running the protagonist through an emotional ringer. Continually setting Alex up with the bad guy's ""outrageous"" ""unthinkable"" vile deeds, continually showing a bad guy with no redeemable qualities, but yet Alex must capture him so that he can escape later to re-terrorize Alex and his family. His action sequences are rarely coherent in a time line - villains are covered by weapons, but are able to so ""suddenly"" draw a weapon and start firing and/or turn lunge and escape. It is more like the author thinks in a turn based system, where everyone gets some action then waits for the other guy to go, and he gets to do all his actions before anyone can react. Very unrealistically described action sequences."
4,a good read,"James Patterson's Alex Cross' books have been a little up and down. This one is ok. I enjoyed reading it,b ut then I enjoy almost any mystery book and don't ask for a lot but to be entertained and I was.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
5,Totally twisted with full of twist!!,"Okay James Paterson fooled me on this, one not once, not twice but three times. Again the ending is shocking as usuaul and left with a cliff hanger!! Alex Cross on the trail of the Mastermind and the Mastermind seems so lucid that there were no clues to track him down. Reading the Mastermind in third person was an exciting element to the book because it made it hard to guess who the heck he was!! In the Alex Cross Series this is my second favorite book!! Surperb suspense!!"
1,Frustrating book.,"I've enjoyed many of Patterson's books in the past, but I have to agree with many of the posts here. Roses Are Red is a complete let down. The surprise ending did nothing but make me angry at the writer. The last thing a writer should do is make thier readers feel cheated, and that is precisely what he did to me. Hope Patterson learns this lesson before his next book."
4,Give this book a chance - I really liked it!,"I can't believe some of the poor reviews this book is getting - sure it is frustrating to read the ending and not be able to read the sequel right away, but it was still a great read. I guess I'm not as smart as some of the other reviewers, because I was totally surprised by the ending. I would have given this book 5 stars if it had been longer! I would love to see Cross have a relationship that can last for more than one book - all in all, I liked this book more than any of his others in the Cross series."
4,"Shocked, bothered by ending","I guess I echo the sentiments of many of the other reviewers. I have become well acquainted with Alex Cross through many readings of Patterson's books, and the ending of Roses are Red, for two reasons, shocked and disappointed. But I cannot help but wonder what direction his next Cross novel will take because of the enormity of the ending. It throws everything out of whack. I am curious to see how the next book in the Alex Cross series fares. I loved the book, until about the fifth to last page."
3,"Thought is was good, until the end","Thought this was a suspenseful, very engaging book but was very disappointed and disturbed by the ending. Patterson could have resolved the ending with the same things left hanging without the last hook. I'm pretty sure a large amount of his readers will feel the same."
3,Cheated,"Alex Cross was as great as ever in this latest book, with all he had to endure with Christine and Janine. But when I finished it, it felt very anti-climatic. The end was a surprise but it felt like it was put in there just to have a surprise ending and to make sure you buy the next Alex Cross book. The book was just too short and the main story not meaty enough. Not as fab as his previous."
5,Awesome,You will never see the ending coming!!! The Alex Cross series is a must read for any crime mystery lover.
4,"I know, another rhyme...","Just keep going. It really is worth it. They are each different, each twisted, each brings you a new plot to unravel."
2,Not his best,I love James Patterson but when reading this I felt like it was rushed. I only got partially through and decided to stop reading.
1,This book makes me see Red.,"I only gave this book a one star because I could not give it anything lower. I am convinced Patterson does absolutely no research for his books. However, this is one of the worst offenders of his books. Patterson's plots using Cross are getting more and more far-fetched. It is reasonable to have one serial killer obsessed with Alex Cross but four or more get real. I also have a lot of trouble believing that no physical evidence would be found at a crime scene. This book was horrible poorly written and researched. If you like reading tripe this is the book for you."
2,"Quick read, but not up to Patterson par","I got this book and finished it in a total of three and a half hours. Although his books are usually a quick read, I became bored with the plot halfway through. Hopefully he will provide criminal motivation and method of thinking in the next book, because the criminal seems totally out of character here. I still haven't decided if I'll read the next one."
3,ANTICLIMACTIC ...,"The only reason I gave three stars is because this book grabs you in the beginning and promises you a wild ride. All your favorite characters are back along with a new sicko serial killer who ""affectionately"" calls himself the Mastermind. I feel the book was very well written and keeps you hanging to the bitter end where it drops you like yesterday's garbage. I was more offended by the ending ... or lack thereof ... than the three sleepless nights I gave up devouring this book."
2,Unfinished Manuscript,"I was disappointed in this book. The beginning of the story caught my attention, even on vacation in Cancun, but I wasn't impressed with the way our hero tried to figure things out. In other books, he played a greater role and used his trained psychologist's abilities to look for a villain. It seemed to me that Patterson was running up against his publisher's deadline and was also looking for a beginning for the next book which will probably be called ""Violets are Blue""; and maybe in that story, the Mastermind will be eliminated."
3,"If you work in the banking industry, DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!!","I will say the book grabs your attention right from the start. Several murders of bank employees and their families (kids included) leave you with nightmares until you finish the book. Even then it doesn't satisfy you with the whole ""Justice Will Prevail"" thing. The real killer never gets caught! Roses Are Red leaves you feeling like there really could be a mastermind out there who COULD get away with the perfect crime. If you enjoy this type of ""criminal gets away"" story, then by all means buy it. I, for one, will be trying to rid my mind of the images it has created for me."
2,Disappointed,I love Patterson's book and was so excited when this book hit the shelves. But I was so disappointed with it and bored. Hated the ending and hope that he'll do better by Alex Cross in his next novel.
4,Another Winner by Patterson,"I have read all the Alex Cross series and found this one to be enjoyable. It wasn't as intense and suspenseful as some of the others. It had the normal characters (Nana, the kids) as well as a few new characters and the story was never boring. There was some twists and turns that were unsuspected. Was worth reading."
2,Very Disappointing,"I got this book for Christmas and was eagerly anticipating another great read from Mr. Patterson as I have enjoyed all of his other books. However, I was extrememly disappointed with the turn of events. The subplots (Cross's daughter getting sick) should have been developed more. It seemed like they were just thrown in to fill up the pages. As for the ""MasterMind"", it made absolutely no sense when he was finally revealed. I felt like there should have been a couple of more chapters explaining it a little better. I can only assume that there will be a sequel explaining it a little better but I am very disappointed that I will have to wait another year or more."
3,Good pace: weak ending,I enjoy Mr. Patterson's books and found this one held my interest to the very end. But unfortuenately the ending was disappointing and seemed to be setting the reader up for a follow on book with the villian free to continue his evil pursuits.
2,"Grisham-style cheap ending, not well thought out.","I had a feeling when I saw Mr. Patterson hawking this book on television ads that this wasn't going to be a strong read. As I was reading, I had hopes that I was going to be pleasantly surprised, but he resorts to a very cheap trick at the end, forcing a sequel. Furthermore, the plot sort of jumps between situations, which is normal for his books--only this time, he doesn't develop either one very effectively. This book comes across as something that Mr. Patterson did under pressure from his publisher."
2,Bad Ending,"I have read all of the ""Alex Cross"" books and this one the worst. The ending was very surprising but yet, it doesn't give a a reason for why the Mastermind has done all of this. It seems like Patterson couldn't come up with an ending and just added this in at athe last minute. I will read the sequel however, to see what he has come up with."
2,Patterson Putters,"The good news is that I finished the story, it did hold my interest till the end. The premise is not all that different than his other books. I always liked the main and supporting characters-unfortunately they are not fleshed out enough. The dialog reminded me too much of words in a blurb written for a comic-book. I will say Roses Are Red is better than ""Pop Goes The Weasel"". Patterson's books are a fast read, they're not meant for book-club readings. His books are fast, quick and non taxing."
3,Not up to par,"It looks like Patterson is looking for an end to the story and could not find it, but vola here it is. A set up for the next version ? Come on let's do better."
2,Disappointed!,"I have always eagerly anticipated the next Alex Cross book and could hardly wait to get my hands on ""Roses Are Red"". To be fair I must say that I did find it to be a page turner to the very end. But I felt cheated and deceived by the ending. It was just not up to par. It almost seems as if someone else slapped on the last chapter or Mr. Patterson felt he had to come up with the most surprising ending he could think of to throw us ""off the scent"". If this was meant to entice us to read the next book I have to say it has had the opposite effect on me. I read because it offers a better stimulation of the mind than TV viewing. This ending seems to better suit a TV movie of the week. Weak. I expected better."
1,Can I give ZERO stars?!,"Granted, my sensibilities may be on the genteel side, but surely NO ONE enjoys reading a first person account of a killer molesting his victim's corpse. I tossed it aside a week ago and I still feel ill thinking about it. Keep on searching, folks; there are literally a million more worthy choices here."
3,roses are red,"I'm a student at Northeast High School and have already read two of James Patterson's novels in class(When the Wind Blows and The Lake House). Both of the books featured short chapters and an easy to read style that turned me on the Patterson's books. I have to say I would never read the rest of his novels. I'm not that big of a mystery fan. This book with it's juggling between Cross' love affairs and childrens problems, along with his tracking of one of the most amazingly psychotic killers I have ever read about make this book extremely hard to put down. I would have to recommend it to someone who enjoys plot twists and really imaginative and bizarre characters."
1,"Patterson is no ""Mastermind""","What's happened to James Patterson? I have read all of his books and enjoyed each and every one...until the last two. ""Pop Goes the Weasel"" was horrible! It was as if he wrote it in an hour! I thought it was a mere lapse of genius, so I purchased and read ""Roses are Red"". His writing is elementary, his story lines so stale and boring, I hesitate to buy another book by him. While waiting for ""Pop..."", I began reading Jonathan Kellerman. Each book was different and exciting. I have now finished every book Kellerman has written. Mr. Patterson should try one to see what real writing is all about! If he's bored with writing, as he seems to be, does he not think I will become bored with reading him?"
5,He is back!.. Its James Patterson at his finest!,I have read ALL of the James Patterson books and love the series following Alex Cross and his buddy Sampson. Roses are Red was yet another excellent story following the killers who are out to get Alex and his family. Normally I am upset at a book ending leaving me hanging.. but this one was great and left me eager to read the next one.. HURRY UP JAMES..
2,"Cheated by the ""ending""...","I found most of this book to be a very good, fast read. But I was terribly disappointed by the ending, where Patterson abruptly pulled not one, but *two* bad guys out of a hat. There's an art to creating a good mystery/thriller; a technique of placing clues & hints for the reader to find, and Patterson for some reason decided to cheat at the end and just pulled the bad guys pretty much out of thin air. Very unsatisfying."
1,Cross's light extinguished,"I waited with eager anticipation for the arrival of a new Cross novel. ""Roses Are Red"" is possibly one of the biggest disappointments of the year. The writing bordered on junior high school essays. There was little character development...just plain shallow. So much for anticipation!"
2,should have been much better,I beleive this is my fifth Patterson book and sad to say it is not of the quality I have found with his other writings. The ending was not expected and not as a exciting finish would be. Seeing all the other reviews I feel I am repeating them. I hope a great writer will see his mistake and come back with a really good novel. Best of luck Mr. Patterson
2,Disappointment,"After waiting anxiously for the release, I was so disappointed with this book. I really disliked the short chapter layout, and short sentence structure. Not the usual Patterson writing. The storyline was vague and it didn't seem like Cross contributed anything to finding the killer. I'm not waiting anxiously for the next one."
3,It's not THAT bad,"OK, James Patterson has some explaining to do. Like the identity of the Mastermind. I didn't expect that one. But the story was fine nonetheless. For those who complain about the personal stuff, like Alex's relationship with Christine or his daughter's illneess, I think this makes the character of Alex Cross more real, more human. Everyone has issues to deal with and those issues often enter into our professional lives. Even Alex Cross has a life outside of the word of forensic psycholgy and the DC police. I am looking forward to finding out how the Mastermind evolved from what he was originally. Hopefully the next Alex Cross book will tell us."
2,Cross needs to retire,"A very disappointing book. I found myself skipping through the secondary story of Cross' personal life. The main story was contrived. After finishing, I found myself re-reading uple of sections to try and find a link between the ending(s). I think this is the last Corss book I will purchase."
2,Worse Patterson book,"I agree with some of the reviewers who were really disappointed with this book. The ending makes no sense, particularly if you've read Patterson's other books. It's like at the very end, Patterson simply said, ""Let's see, who do I want to say is the Mastermind?"" Why didn't he just leave a blank and let the reader fill it in (the Lady and the Tiger). I think I'll pick Nana. Bottom line: Patterson's running out of good ideas."
2,Disappointing,"I started reading Patterson several years ago with ""Along Came a Spider"" and I have bought each new Cross novel with anticipation. With each Cross novel after ""ACaS"", Patterson becomes more disappointing. This novel is a quick read, for sure, but not because of suspense - it is because of the length of each ""chapter"". There is no build up of tension, the Cross children have become ridiculous characters (this book dedicates too much time to them) and the ending, although a surprise, made me laugh out loud. I want to be shocked at the end of my thrill novels, not humored. This may be my last Cross novel."
1,disappointing ending,"This is my first James Patterson novel. I read ""Against Medical Advice"" which was based on a true story and i really enjoyed that one, so i thought this would be great. Well i kept reading and reading because it thought at some point Alex Cross was going to be this great hero, and prove to be a mastermind himself. But his biggest break in the case was when someone blew the whistle on their own father. No amazing display of detective work there.... In fact Alex Cross has NO CLUE until the end of the book... and yet i'm still unsure if he really knew. There was no motive no rhyme or reason for the ending.Not sure if i want to read another James Patterson book again. My husband had warned me that he didn't like james patterson, and i should have listened. Waste of time. Will have to try another author."
3,Good . But the use of GD word is often,This is a book of Bank Robberies and killings of bank managers families and a few detectives . I was able to read the entire book however I found the GD word that used way to many times in book to be a little offensive so I won't be reading anymore of the Alex Cross series .The book would have been just as good without the GD words in it .Lilla
3,"Good, but flawed","This review is based on the six-hour audiobook version of this book. The book definitely keeps your attention and the pacing is very good. However, the primary problem I had was the way Patterson simply seemed to pick the identity of ""The Mastermind"" out of thin air. There was nothing in the book to suggest that this was the person behind the acts being investigated, nor was there any motivation given for why this person was involved in these activities. This is especially troublesome given the nature of the activities and who ""The Mastermind"" actually was. I understand that ""The Mastermind"" shows up in Patterson's latest novel, so perhaps in reading it some of his motivation will be explained."
3,Reasonably happy until the end,"I read James Patterson's books for the excitement of the story. The characters are not usually well developed and the dialogue isn't great but the pace is fast and enjoyable.The ending, however, was a huge disappointment. It was like the author had a deadline from the publisher and simply turned in the half that he wrote. You have to buy Violets are Blue in hardcover to get the ending (I think) though I'm not sure its worth it. He definitely owes his readers more."
3,"""GOOD BOOK----BAD ENDING""","Another good James Patterson book until the ending. Patterson's imagination is wonderful.The book starts great, it grabs you by the throat and never lets go. A series of crimes with bank employees and their families getting killed for no apparent reason. Cross and Sampson take off to try and find the so called Mastermind, who is behind it all. I like the short chapters as I have to quit quite often and it makes it easier. The three rating was because of the ending. I am pretty sure I would have bought his next book but I hate to feel forced into it. If I read 378 pages, paperback, I think I should be through. Shame on you James Patterson for an ending like that. I guess it is one way to string everybody along and sell another book, however, you are a great writer, you did not need to do this."
4,WOW,"Just finished reading ""Roses Are Red""! Awesome! The ending totally surprised me. The Mastermind wasn't who I expected him to be! When's the next book coming out???? Can't wait that long...."
1,"Goodnight, Alex Cross","Alex Cross stumbles into the nightmarish world of deceit, when he walks right past the killer once again, thinking the bad guy is a friend/colleague. This premise from Patterson is getting tired. He tried it in Kiss the Girls, and it made out ok. I was fooled and was happy about it. Got my money's worth. This time was too much, though.Patterson lost a reader in me."
3,The ending stunk!,"I have read eight of Patterson's novels so far and was totally disppointed how he ended this one. It was like the phone rang while he was finishing the novel or he had to be somewhere and just closed it leaving the reader empty. The story was fairly good, but the ending was so rushed. I hate books where the killer is revealed but nothing is done about it. I can only guess that Patterson left it that way to start out the next novel. But I can't help but feel let down and cheated, that the characters in this story were never vindicated."
3,Perfect Crime,"Alex finds himself totally involved with his work and he is having some big issues with this personal life. He has a bank robber that is getting away with murder and the money. The villain is a control freak. He has plans for one last perfect crime of his career. There are many surprises in the story. Patterson leaves some problems to be answer in some future book. By Ruth Thompson author of ""Natchez above the River"""
4,the mastermind is another great villain,James Patterson has the same faults in all of his books his dialogue especially when Cross is involved in a romance can be overwritten to the point of being lugubrious but he has the fast pacing and intense action as strengths as well as his main recurring characters butthe best Ctoss novels have the best villians and the Mastermind a planner of daring robberies which include kidnapping the branch managersfamilies is the best villian in this series.The whole novel flies by and the ending is for once believable but unpredictable. This is the best of all the Alex Cross and would get 5 stars except for Pattersons tendency to spend too much on romance which he is not good at writing
4,"Great Story, with a twist","Roses was a great story. I found it difficult to put this book down at nights and many times i stayed awake hours longer than i should have just to read what happens next. Initially, reading the begining i thought i might be unimpressed with a muderous bank robbing spree, but the character development and the thinkening of the plot really drew me in.Reading several of Patterson's Cross novels now how caused me to really feel for the characters in the story and that is a testament to Patterson's great writing style.The twist at the end this book will have you reeling. I'm still unsure whether i like the twist or not. Nevertheless, it was totally unforseen and i kind of like it when that happens."
2,Quite a marketing ploy,"Although I've enjoyed previous Patterson books, this one was definitely weak and had a stupid, nonsensical ending, which leaves the reader going ""huh?"" At the end of the paperback version of this badly contrived ""cliffhanger,"" which came out in Oct. '01, they print a teaser first 3 chapters of the sequel, due out--surprise, surprise--in November! Forget it, Patterson, this reader isn't going to waste the money, especially on a hardback version. It's clear that marketing was a greater motivator than artistic integrity in this enterprise.I got the distinct feeling that Patterson must be tired of the characters but is pushed by publishers and greed to churn out additional books long after he's too burned out to do them justice. Call it the Patricia Cornwell effect. In fact, both Cornwell and Patterson have focused on their characters' burnout and depression, which seem to mirror their own feelings about feeling pressured to churn out another one. It's too bad."
1,What Happened?,"I usually enjoy Patterson's novels, but like so many other reviewers, I was left baffled by this one. To me, it seemed as if he had no idea how to end the storyline and just picked the least likely person to be the 'villian.' I was literally trying to figure out if my book was missing a chapter or two or a dozen. Also, shouldn't he come up with a new twist by now? Why any of this is a shock to Alex Cross is beyond me, since everything that happens in this novel has happened to him in the previous novels.In some ways I hope he writes a new Alex Cross novel that explains the mess he made out of this one, but I won't be buying it in hardcover, that's for sure."
1,contrived,"does anyone in cross's family have any faults? why does the author tell us somthing, then repeat it in dialogue? where's the editor? the ""twist"" was weak, and the ending was so hollywood. too hollywood. alex solved nothing in this book. all infor was either handed to him, or some snitch popped up for unnanounced when it seemed all was lost. contrived. too many characters are introduced in a few pages. his daughters illnes came and went. contrived. and the short chapter thing sucks, especially when he breaks it off mid-scene. he's misusing and overusing that device."
2,Horrible!,"James Patterson, I think you have run out of steam. It took me forever to read this book, because there was not much suspense for me since it was all in pretty much the usual pattern. This time we are dealing with bank robbers of the most brutal kind and a mastermind behind this robberies. Also, Janie falls ill in this installment and Alex Cross finds a new romantic interest. Unfortunately, the book gives us not much closure at all but sets us up for the sequel. I guess either Mr. Patterson is getting very greedy or he had a deadline to meet."
1,What am I missing?,"A disappointing effort, particularly the lame ending. Most disturbing is the fact that apparently DNA testing is not available in our nation's capital. The villain rapes one of his victims in an attempt to create an heir, yet even when they've apparently narrowed the search down to someone residing in one building, they just can't imagine who it could be. Wouldn't DNA have helped identify the killer here or did I miss one of Patterson's contrived explanations along the way? Save your money, its not even worth buying a used paperback of this novel."
1,Too Retorical!,"James Patterson seems to be striving to become the king of the retorical question. This book is loaded with them!If you are at all interested in decent character development or well written dialog - do yourself a favor and don't spend money on this book.I have read several of Patterson's books, and this is by far the worst - and it will be my last!"
2,A quick ride to nowhere,The best thing I can say about this book is that it reads very quickly. The title makes no sense. The revelation on the last page is contrived and an obvious set up for the sequel. No clues along the way. I'll continue to read Patterson's books because of this track record but Jimmy! Get it together!
4,Roses are red,Had me wanting to turn age after page to find out want was going to happen. Love the way James Patterson writes
2,"James Patterson, please come back !","Like so many other reviewers, I have been terribly disappointed in James Patterson's last several novels! I keep buying his books, hoping that I will be as thrilled with them as I was his first several efforts - but I've been continually disappointed! There is no depth to his characters anymore, they seem very thin and superficial.The stories he weaves are repetitve with never any closure to the plot or the character's situations.I will not buy his future novels in hardcover, until the ""real"" James Patterson returns to write stories with characters and relationships we care about,and a plot that can hold our attention for more that five minutes."
3,A Rose by any other name,"Another Patterson page turner. Short Chapters. Predictable in that the whodunit didn't do it.Shock ending disappoints, leaves many loose ends.Patterson is brain candy. Entertaining not inspiring."
5,"You won't be disappointed, or maybe you will.","I enjoyed this book as much or more than the other Alex Cross novels. Patterson keeps you guessing through the whole book. I never expected the ending, it was a complete surprise! Keep them coming!"
3,Who is the Mastermind?,I enjoyed Roses are Red. The storyline was interesting from beginning to end but I found it lacked a lot of the action from Mr. Patterson's previous Alex Cross series. Finding out who the Mastermind really was came as quite a surprise but it really shouldn't have since the question was poised within the storyline. I believe you'll enjoy even though I found it lacking of its usual style.
3,Roses Are Red,"After reading all of the Alex Cross books and looking forward to this new one, I must say it was not all I had hoped it would be. How can you go under cover when just a while befor you got a letter from the killer...he knows you and you are Alex Cross and you should of known that he knew...I knew. I'm sorry I will hope for a better one next time I don't give up on my writers"
1,Cheap Shot,"The conclusion is of the genre sometimes termed ""cheap shot."" Beyond the fact that it has no merit, it is patently contrived to provide a jumping off for the next chapter in this unending series. Janet Reno and her successor would be thrilled to learn that their title has been changed to ""Secretary of Justice."" Did no editor review the MS? There are numerous similar errors, should one chose to be picky. But the fact remains that such anomalies tend to disrupt the flow for the reader, and demonstrate a lack of respect by the author for his audience. I shall not come this way again."
5,The Best So Far!,I found this book to be riviting...especially at the end. I must say...the end took me totally by surprise!
1,Thoroughly disappointing,"This Alex Cross mystery is miserable. Truly. The detective is hit with disappointment after disappointment, the sociopathic killer is exceptionally depraved, and once this ponderous riddle is FINALLY resolved, the ending is unbelievably contrived and unfulfilling. Also, a note to Mr. Patterson: three paragraphs does not make a chapter. You don't get extra credit because of a high chapter count. I'd settle for a worthy follow-up to ""Kiss the Girls."" It's been several years, and I'm still waiting."
3,Could have been better,"Just finished the new James Patterson and was a little disappointed. Not one of his better novels but still a good read. The plot was a bit predictable. I figured out who the ""Mastermind"" was half way through. Could have done with a few more twists, he spent to much time writing about Christine who had nothing to do with the plot."
3,Okay- if you say so,"This book cruises along like all of Patterson's stuff. Alex Cross finds himself confronted with a murder/robbery spree that just doesn't add up. Eventually, he discovers that a new criminal (imagine that) called the Mastermind is behind this particularily gruesome rash of murders.So far, so good. I mean this is what you expect from an Alex Cross novel. But how many masterminds are there in this book? Two, three or more?I just did not see where the ending came from. Having read Violets are Blue first (which is the wrong order) I knew who the real bad guy was, but I don't see the foundation for this conclusion through out Rose Are Red. It almost seems like Patterson changed his mind somewhere along the way and forgot to put the clues in.If you like Alex Cross, then you know what to expect. I guess that's why I keep coming back for more."
5,"Roses Are Red, Violets Are Blue I loved this and so will you","James Patterson is a writer that gets better with every book, He is going strong with Detective Alex Cross and I cannot believe how good his writing is, I am impressed with all his books, this time Alex is after The Mastermind a ruthless killer/robber, he has planned a series of bank robberies and murders, the book starts off like Pop Goes The Weasel, It introduces you to the killer immediately a person donning a Bill Clinton mask, he kills people in the bank, takes there money and locks the cashiers in the safe, throughout the book Alex tries to stop this killer before he strikes again. Do not miss this and Violets Are Blue"
4,Quick Read,"As usual, Patterson puts together a moving story that involves murder and great detective work. In this book, Detective Alex Cross works with the FBI to solve a string of robberies/murders that keeps you turning the pages. My only hesitation in rating this book with 5 stars was Patterson's tendency to weight this book down with a lot of family/personal problems that the lead character (Cross) was experiencing while trying to solve the mystery. While personal problems are certainly a part of life, I felt it was a bit overdone in this book.Patterson is very knowledgeable of police and FBI procedures and reading his books is always an eye opener to the world of crime fighting. I highly recommend any mystery fan read this book."
2,Horrible ending,"This was a pretty good book for the most part. It's a pretty standard mystery/thriller, but a nice way to while away an afternoon. But the ending completely ruined it for me. It simply made no sense given the way the story plays out just before this ending, which one can only imagine was meant to shock, is revealed. Had the author cared enough to try and explain this seemingly incongruous revelation, I might have liked it better. But perhaps even he couldn't find a way to make it work."
4,"Bums on the run, one of the very 1st L&H films",This is one of the very first Laurel & Hardy films. The boys are a couple of bums who are on the run from the cops and the forestservice who believe that they started a forest fire. They hide in the empty home of millionaire Col. Buckshot. When someone showsup wanting to rent the house Ollie impersonates Col Buckshot while Stan does double duty impersonating both the butler and the maid.This film was later remade as a talking short called Another Fine Mess.
5,One of the year's best novels...,"Nathan Landry is shocked to find the police at his home on his return from school. The shock heightens as his fathers appears, bloody, from the side of the house. The story unfolds as Nate experiences the many ramifications of his father's attempted suicide. He is ostricized from his small ranching community and doesn't even know what really happened to his father, as he was carted away in an ambulance with no explanation given. It is when Nate realizes the next level of his local science fair will be held in Butte, a neighboring town to where is his father is hospitilized, that Nate realize his hope in finding the truth lies in his science fair project.His journey begins with Naomi, fellow outcast, and ends with a statling realization. This book will touch the reader is a endearing way that few books do.Reluctant readers, boys, those will a love of science or anyone who just enjoys a good read, will appreciate this book."
5,Wonderful to read aloud,This is the book that Stuart J. Murphy *wishes* he wrote. It is so rare that a children's book succeeds in merging literature with math gracefully. Seven Scary Monsters would be delightful if I did not have misgivings about the violence evoked by some of the methods by which the monsters are dispelled. This little boy has ray-guns and flame-throwers. It's from the school of children's lit where the coyote falls off the cliff only to live another day to chase the roadrunner.
1,No Steam!,Bought this hoping for a good amount of steam for facials and sinus problems.. hardly any steam comes out and there are too many little pieces and parts. Not worth the $$ at all. I'm back to boiling a large pot of water for steam.
1,Not recommendable,"I bought this product from Amazon only 50 days ago. I followed instructions carefully but the machine did not work properly. Though I set the timer to 15 minutes, the mister shut itself off after only 5 minutes. The steam did not feel warm enough and the cool mist did not feel cool but warm.This is the second time I get disappointed at a Conair product. I had a Conair hair dryer that stopped working in less than 2 months. From now on, I will stay away from any CONAIR product."
2,Nothing to write home about,Rip fence broke almost immediatly. Every part is madedown to price. Look at Sears - for the same price you'llget much better quality.
4,GOOD CD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,THE CD IS GOOD. I WAS JUST EXPECTING MORE FROM HER ON THIS PROJECT. THE DVD WAS HORRIBLE.
5,Excellent resource,"TDP is a concise (just over 300 pages), well-written history of the death penalty in America from the colonial period to the present. The book has no agenda as far as persuading the reader as to the ""for-or-against"" debate. Very informative on both the concrete, legal issues as well as the more abstract moral/philosophical concepts invoked by the topic. This is mandatory reading for anyone with a serious interest in the topic.Highly recommended."
3,"Good jacket, color not as pictured","Just to warn people, this jacket is a MUCH brighter green than it appears in the picture. It was a surprise, but I am otherwise happy.On the plus side, I probably won't be hit by a car while wearing ot."
2,A little disappointed,I bought this book after reading so many falling all over it at several other sites! Falling all over what? Have we reached the point where there is so little original info that anything is great? Pictures that were published in many cases long ago by not only Frank Johnson but several others from the UK as well. To much art work and not enough photographs for the price and to include drawings for so little value from a modelers perspective is even more disappointing. Im a little worried what volume II looks like....I think ill wait for a few more reviews of a more honest nature!
3,Truly a Picture Book...,"A decent photo survey, primarily black and white images. Minimal text, mostly captions for photos. Very little meat here in terms of detailed information on the subject beyond the photos and diagrams. Reprinted construction plans and drawings (from microfilms according to the author) are really too small to be very useful, although generally interesting. Really a scrapbook of photos and drawings rather than a history of American PT Boats. A decent work, but I was looking for more actual information about design, construction, and combat use of the boats."
5,The current photo source on PTs,"Chun's book is THE photographical reference available today. If you want printed information on PT boats you buy two books: this for photographs, diagrams and all things visual and Bulkeley's AT CLOSE QUARTERS for extremely detailed accounts of PT actions. Good job Chun!"
5,Must have for the beginner weaver,"This is the perfect book for beginner, or us not so beginner, weavers. It's small size is perfect for tossing in your project bag, taking along to class, or reading while you are waiting at the doctor's office."
2,The Weaver's Companion,"The card stock it is printed on is very difficult to turn over. It also makes the book too heavy to carry with you, as suggested, on a shopping trip for supplies. It is very elementary, but it was a good idea to compile the information. The form it is in makes it useless."
4,"Good reference, once it was finally published","This book is about what I expected after seeing the Knitter's Companion. The various charts and explanations are helpful, and it will be a good reference book."
5,Beautiful Vocal and Small-Group Jazz,"Vert rare. If you find this one anywhere, buy it. Originally recorded as a vinyl LP titled ""Feelings"" by a local jazz quartet in Wichita, Kansas, it features the amazing vocals of Art Hicks with the Johnny Harris Quartet. Perfect performances by all. Hicks' performance of ""Since I Fell For You"" will send chills down your spine. Eleven hits on this album. This is a remix ""tribute"" album of the original 1976 title ""Feelings"" following the death of Art Hicks in 1994. You really should have this rare album in your jazz collection if you can find it. Not many were made."
2,Have gone back to using regular razor and shaving cream,"Not bad for a quick, not too precise trim, but the traditional shaving cream and regular razor is STILL faster and more thorough. Also, it sits poorly in it's charging base, making it difficult to get a good charge."
4,Great Shaver and compact too!,"I previously used a Remington shaver which broke on me after three years of constant use. I didn't want to spend too much money on a replacement shaver and I saw this one on Amazon. I ordered it and it's been great ever since. It shaves great. It's even okay to use on the sensitive parts of your body. It comes in a cute little lavender pouch and it's the perfect size. My previous shaver was a little bulky, but this one I think is small enough to travel with but not too small in regards to handling it. Overall I think it's a great shaver."
2,dead in less than 3 years,"As a few others have noted, the battery on this is... questionable. I had a Remington a long time ago, and then a Panasonic, and I think I'll try one of those again. I bought this in Feb of '03 here with a Gold Box discount for $36 total, and it seems too soon for it to stop working."
1,this thing sucks,"Besides the fact that its not a close shave the battery life on this sucks so much, since you have to go over each area like 2 or 3 times you only get to shave like a leg and a half. If that works for you then this is just perfect."
1,Conair Shaver,I've used much better electric shavers in the past. I find it hard to hard to get a close shave but easy to scrape my skin.
1,Great for 1st few months,"Works fine for the first few months, but then the battery doesn't want to recharge to full capacity. As a result it doesn't spin fast enough to really ""cut"" anything, it just catches and hurts and doesn't work."
3,"Ok, but could be better.","This is my second shaver, this one works much better than my previous. However- I've had it for almost a year, and can't find replacement cutters anywhere for it. Therefore, it doesn't cut well anymore! I recomend getting something else, and making sure you can find replacement cutters!"
1,poor quality,The battery life is the worst of any electric razor I've ever used. The razor doesn't provide a close shave and mine broke after just three uses. The razor is very cheaply constructed and I would not recommend this to anyone. You're better off spending twice the money to get a durable machine.
3,"OK, but not great","I've had this shaver for about 2 years.It worked well at first, for about 6 months, then it started going downhill. It does not hold a charge well. I can barely get through a good shave of both legs on one charge. The motor sounds noticably 'slower' than it did in the beginning.Also, you probably need to buy new blades for it more often than I do. The shave started getting 'spotty' (leaving uncut hairs) after only about 10 shaves.Again, it's alright, especially for the price. But I think there are better shavers out there with more value."
1,Bad,"stopped working from the very second use. bought 2 pieces, both stopped working. Not worth the money. Totally unsatisifed."
4,Beast of a Movie,"I know this is a low budget quickie, and, as such, would probably be regarded by 'experts' as not having much cinematic merit. But I have to say that, speaking merely as an average cinemagoer, I liked it a lot. I found the storyline to be good, the acting and direction to be more than adequate, and Chris Robinson's spider monster to be genuinely scary. The film moves along at a good pace, and the climactic final ten minutes - in the cave - are very effective. All in all, a cut above the usual horror 'B' movie output of the period."
1,Corman-fan,"I'm not sure how the earlier reviews of this ""Alpha brand DVD"" seem to be describing a better quality DVD manufactured by someone else. This is a pathetic public domain copy with 1.33:1 aspect ratio. Don't be fooled by the misleading reviews that belong to a different product. You can find better junk at the wal-mart or dollar store and much cheaper."
2,"Too little, too late","While fairly well acted for this type of flick, the pacing is awful for viewers who need regular doses of monster scenes throughout. In this case it's too little monster during the first three quarters and way too much monster at the end. The characters move around from place to placetalking endlessly about their lives while we barely even get a glimpse of the Beast. But during the last ten minutes we witness several attack scenes in a row - which left me wondering why we couldn't get more of these scenes peppered throughout instead of just saved until the end. Cool looking monster, but overall tedious viewing."
3,Corman Slipped-UP,"Despite Corman's usual approach(use cast & crew of another film to make this one while filming the other film) this one is actually entertaining.Good Plot,not too badly done(forgive the F/X) monster crude & Campy. Enjoy if you Dare!"
2,This Monster Travels At A Slow Crawl,"A gang arrives in a skiing town with a gold-heist plan that involves blowing up a cave to create a diversion and then making their escape on skis with the unwitting aid of a ski instructor. Unfortunately for all concerned, their meddling in the cave unleashes a hair, spider-like monster that follows on their get-away.If your reaction is to say ""I bet Roger Corman had a hand in this,"" you'd be correct; he was producer of note. With the single exception of Sheila Carol, who strikes the right notes as an unwilling gang-moll named Gypsy, the cast is notably sub-par. The monster consists of a fright-wig and some spider-ish tentacles, often presented in painfully transparent double-exposure. And let us say nothing of production values at all.HAUNTED CAVE is slow, talky, and utterly uninspired. Even hardcore fans of 1950s ""B"" and ""C"" monster movies will be hard pressed to find anything in it. Two stars, and that's being generous.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"
1,Not much of a flick,"This film was a real dissapointment for me. I bought it in a dual pack with another low budget horror 60's film and was just left with nothing. I wasn't really sure exactly what kind of movie this was...an independent film made by some students? Is it a crime/thriller film? Is it a horror movie? Horrible acting, pathetic script, uninventive special effects, and a monster that's in the movie for only about 10 minutes. I appreciate low budget horror films (chainsaw massacre, night of the living dead, the season of the witch), but this one just doesn't cut it for me."
3,Get the Miles Jaye Irresistible CD from Miles Jaye's Website,"I too wore out my Irresistible cassette tape. I decided to look for the CD several years ago and learned that it wasn't for sale on any retail website. Noticing that Miles Jaye has a website from my searches, I finally went to it recently to see if it would explain why you can't buythe Irresistible album. That's how I found out that you can buy the download on his website as well as his other albums."
5,Day of Power is GREAT!,"I was looking for a CD I would enjoy listening to without garbage (you know, ""garbage in, garbage out...""). This is ""my kind of music"" with a powerful Christian message. The musical styles are varied from song to song, which keeps it interesting. My kids are exposed to so much ""trash"" in their every day lives, they (WE) need more alternatives like this to enjoy!"
3,"VINYL review, not content","This is part of MoFi's Silver series because the recording is digital (as the sleeve proudly proclaimed back in the day). I can't recall what the original vinyl sounded like as I gave it away in the glory of the CD age, but I am luke warm about this expensive reissue. Don't bother, it is not worth $30 (or whatever it will fetch in the upcoming years). Very bright, especially the cymbals. Find an original vinyl or CD. The Edsel reissue CDs are supposed to be good too with dynamic range intact."
5,Never gets old,"This is one of those albums that simply refuses to ever sound old. A lot of ""best of"" lists, like Rolling Stone, give more respect to their first album, but good as that one is, this is their masterpiece. ""Save it for Later"" is surely among the best 3-4 minutes ever made, and Sugar and Stress, I Confess, Sorry, and Jeannette are almost as good. The late 70s and early 80s are true golden age of rock and roll in terms of the quantity of music that really endures and no album from that period is any better than this one. I have listened to hundreds of times and while most of the Beatles albums sit on the shelf. Too bad they broke up and never did anything like this as General Public."
4,Reissued but not Remastered. :(,"This is absolutely one of the great albums from the early 80's! And I was happy to see that a reissued edition was finally released, however, once I had received it & listened, it was OBVIOUSLY not a remastered edition. So, if you're an old fan of this awesome group, I'd definitely recommend that you buy a used copy. But, you'll also want to buy atleast 1 of the 3 remastered collections (ie: ""Beat This!"", ""Platinum Collection"" & ""You Just Can't Beat It"")."
5,It's Back!,"This has to be my all time favorite album and I'm happy to see it back in print. I unfortunately sold the album some 4 years ago (I was the poor starving college student) and subsiquently spent 3 years searching for it in every used CD store in the Seattle area. Favorite tracks are Janette, Rotating Head and Ackee 1-2-3 (I only wish samples for them were available). If you're looking for a definately unique sound that never grows old and while forever remind me of the 80's check out the beat :)"
3,Good for 80s type recipes,Great book for old favorites. Not too good for low fat or low sugar recipes. Loved the sweet potato casserole.
4,Childhood Favorites,"My mother gave me a copy of Applehood & Motherpie after she became worried I was going to steal hers. This 320 page paperback is NOT a beautiful cookbook (no pictures, green text on white pages), but it contains some of my favorite childhood recipes:Canoe Crab DipChili CaseosoSusan's Mushroom CroustadesGrandma Ada's Orange RollsApple Cheese TorteAnd the recipe for Strawberry and Onion Salad with Poppyseed dressing is worth the price alone. I would not recommend this cookbook as a gift, but I would recommend it to anyone with ties to Upstate New York looking for a new, old school all-purpose cookbook."
4,Junior league cookbooks always worth having!,"I love the cover of this book - it flips out and creates an easel for the book to lean on. Ingenious! I have prepared many recipes from this book and have loved most all of them. I like their ""little red apple"", which flags recipes that the editors and recipe testers thought were especially good. Like all Junior League cookbooks, you get the feeling that you have raided the best dishes from the recipe boxes of many people."
5,Great recipes for everyone..,"I bought this cookbook in Rochester, NY when I lived their in 1981. I have dozens of cook books and this one sits right in the front row. I even know most of the places of the recipe Authors live as listed on the recipes. Many came from owners of restaurants in these areas. This book won't teach you how to cook hamburgers, but is an awesome alternative to most cookbooks. It has simple to very elegant dishes, my absolute favorites are in the chowders and the seafood section. The recipes steps and ingredients are dead on (meaning if my dog could read it, she couldn't screw it up and it would be delicious.)Really, you cannot go wrong with this one. 10 stars.D. Holladay"
5,Out of this world!,"I have this on laser disc (yes I'm old) and it's in the top 5 concert videos ever. I've been waiting (and waiting... and waiting...) for this to come out on blu ray to get the improved audio. I don't understand why a phenomenal concert video such as this is still not available, but every awful b-movie is. Is it a crime? Yes!Sade is of course flawless in this (bare feet and all) but what really blew me away was the band's performance, super-tight and with tremendous dynamic range. The saxophone on 'Is It A Crime' is truly amazing but by far the best moment is the guitar solo on 'No Ordinary Love'. You hardly notice this in the studio version and even on the 'Lover's Live' DVD it is not as pronounced. But on this version it rocks! I get chills just thinking about it.This concert is a must-have for any collection, don't wait for the blu-ray!"
5,Must Have .....,Great! A concert with elegance (no overkill props and lights). A Must See concert. Highly recommended.
5,Sade is great!,"Great concert. I used to watch the VHS of this while I cleaned up the Hollywood Video. I saw it was available on DVD, so I had to buy it. I used to listen to it while I studied in college."
5,I love Sade,"There are three Sade DVDs, I own them all, and this one is the best. One of the three is a collection of her videos and though they are well done, there is just nothing like watching an artist--especially someone as talented and emotive as Sade--perform her songs live; it adds another dimension to the experience. It is strange that her music is very different than the music that I like, but yet it still appeals to me. I can't even classify her music; there are a lot of musical genres but there is just one Sade."
3,Live?-Don't You Believe It!,"I work in the production industry, and I can tell you - this is not a live recording. It is quite apparent that what you see on the screen is NOT what you hear from the speakers. Does this mean I don't recommend this DVD? Well, I was a little disappointed at first... But, the music score is well done, and it's fun to see Sade and all her excellent musicians. I just think of it as having a collection of MTV-like videos. They're pretending to be performing live.I have been in a few ""mock"" audiences myself. The music played through the PA speakers, and the band members ""lip-synched"" as if they were really performing. We, in the audience did our best to act as though it was a real concert - all for the cameras.If you're OK with a ""pretend"" LIVE DVD of Sade, then buy this. But, if you want a REAL LIVE concert caught on DVD, then this is not for you."
2,Dissappointing,"Sade wrote some good music and that carries it to two stars for me. Being a musician, I was dissappointed to see how little actual content there was to this concert and how little musical talent Sade has. It was more style than substance. If all you want to do is watch her abs (if you watch the DVD you'll see what I mean) feel free to order it. I don't recommend this DVD; just buy a ""best of"" CD and skip the belly dancing."
5,Sade - Live Concert Home Video,"If you love Sade as I do, this video is an absolute must. From her velvet voice to her subtle, silky choreography, this live performance must not be missed!"
5,Drolling DVD,This was better than a football game to my husband. I couldn't interrupt him for nothing while he was watching this DVD.
4,"Until The Lady records again, this video will help you wait.","* * * * * * * * *Celebrate Singers who Write their Own Songs* * * * * * * She isn't just up there on stage looking sexy... She also wrote most of what she sings. And even though Leroy Osbourne-- her lead backup singer-- ""shows her up"" at one point, the Lady rises to shine despite a tour-worn singing voice. As I was swooning over her sway, my wife snapped me out of my spell by pointing out how cute the trumpeter is. That would be Rick Braun. We now have all his CDs as well. But we want more from The Lady. Sincerely, Derrick Tanner"
3,Some critical information missing here,"This book has many helpful insights but I have found one section that needs to be expanded. The subject of Non-epileptic Seizures, especially those caused by sexual abuse in childhood. There is only a couple of lines that mention it but do not elaborate. Overall a good book however."
4,the cover,"At this moment (december 2006)the cover shows a misprint with the wrong Bachianas numbers. The cd really contains Bachianas no. 7,8,9 as said by Amazon. [...]"
1,Doesn't work,"I had my doubts when I purchased it but being tight on money I thought why not, for the price, it couldn't be that bad if it didn't work. Well I was right, it doesn't work. I have used it twice a day, every day since I got it (over a month) and it does NOT relive puffy eyes."
1,More is Better,"In this age of adding value to CD re-issues, WEA has gone the opposite direction. Not only is this latest version missing ""Tears Of A Clown"" and ""Ranking Full Stop"", it contains no additional bonus songs. Why no b-sides, demos, live versions, or (at the very least) remixes? I'd rather spend less and get more by buying a used copy of the original CD release.Shame.[DW]"
5,"I agree...No ""Tear of a Clown""","The Beat can't be beat, but I agree with the other reviewer who chastised the reissue for omitting ""Tears of a Clown"" from this CD!"
2,Not the orignal L.P. release!,"Rip off! Where's ""Ranking Full Stop it"" and ""Tears of a clown""? The whole reason I bought this C.D. is because my five year old broke my orignial L.P. and I need ""Ranking Full Stop"" to help me vacuum the floors. I guess I have to buy the best of too, bummer."
2,Missing tracks,"Tears of a Clown and Stand down Margret are missing from this release! I wore out my tape of this album back in the 80's and was excited when the CD came out. But where are the missing tracks? These two are a major part of why I liked the album in the first place. Once again, I'm very disappointed in the lp/tape transfer to CD. I give it 2 stars for screwing up a great album. Otherwise this album gets 5 stars."
2,Jin has some dirt under his nose.,"This cd is pretty weak. He just doesn't have what it takes. Even the Trio of Joke Asian Rappers at www.notoriousmsg.com are better then him. Check out their ""Straight Out of Canton"" Music Video at http://www.notoriousmsg.com/video/MSG_Canton.mov"
1,"I'm all for having China rapper or Japan rapper,","I'm all for having China rapper or Japan rapper, not this guy.I can't understand him.GOod track is learn to speak chinese, its gives 1 out of 5."
5,Solid Album,"I gotta say there's some bad songs (Kanye West track) but most of them are solid tracks...go cop it, ""Same Cry"" is a great song"
1,great lyricist wrong record label,"Jin the first chinese rapper to hit the game. I think this kid has alot of talent and skills, I knew from the jump that this album was going to be horrible but I bought it anyways to support my fellow asian brother. Ruff ryders is a dead label point blank. I can understanding being a rookie in the game why Jin grabbed the first deal that came his way but come on now dude you need to be foucs no one will see you better then yourself. the production on this album is trash even Kanye's beat sounds like left overs that he never had the chance to finish. Yo Jin if you ever get to read this you need to connect with THE RZA, WU-TANG RECORDS!!...use the asian market, and use rza beats msta killa's last track on his album now that's a beat worth hearing Jin on."
1,This Guy's weak,"THis Debut is wack. I first saw Jin on 2 Fast 2 Furious then he was on 106 and Park with his video ""Senorita"". That is the only song I ever got from this guy."
3,Couldv'e been better,"Yeah yeah yeah, we all know Jin from BET. All his funny punchlines and the way he man-handled MC's with his words. Became a freestyle champ on Freestyle Friday (BET).Pretty much stops there though. When it comes to making a song, its lacking alot of punch. Most of these songs sound very generic. Theres no ""freshness"" with Jin. It all comes down to medicore album that couldv'e been alot better. Jins defintally got potential, perhaps his sophmore album will show his witty word play most of us are dying to hear over REAL beats.Basically the album sounds recycled, bland, and generic. Can't really explain it anymore then that."
3,Decent 1st Album,"He wins a freestyle battle before his album drops. 106 and park champion and he is asian???? His 1st album is good...but think about this...no one is with Ruff Ryders no more....You got D Block, Yung Wun all of them are gone and they had Eve and DMX so he is the only Ruff Ryder left...Decent 1st album though..."
3,A Dissappointment,"I dunno everyone else on here seems to like this album alot, but I was underimpressed to say the least. After hearing Jin kill the mixtapes and burn cats down in battles I expected a better album. No doubt the dude is brilliant off the top of the head Id go as far as to say one of the best ever and his mixtapes were dope, but this cd should have been much better. He is struggling to go mainstream and hopefully next album he'll be more comfortable with the transition and drop a classic album. Until then Ill continue to listen to him kill the mixtapes and drop insane freestyles."
1,"Try ""Starting Over"" And Buy A Different Book","This book was a total waste of money. It was written by a lawyer who admits to not being an expert on careers. ""Let me say right up front: I'm not a career counselor"" (page 2). If you are miserable in your current career, as am I, then do not expect any help or guidance with this book. It was vague and useless."
3,Not all the songs are well known,"I used to own this product , I bought it when attending a Phil Keaggy Concert . The Videos are supposed to also contain a booklet of the video songs as well , written in tableture , chords & notes ! the video without this boolet is useless as learning material . Time is the only well known song . the others are more obscure making the booklet that much more important . I notice none of the sellers are listing any songs & the needed booklet is not mentioned either . The only song actually played on the video is Walking on Clouds , with Phil Keaggy playing with a live band . Otherwise the songs are played slowly & in segments to TEACH a person to play . This is NOT an entertainment Video! One would be disappointed if purchased for entertainment only ."
1,Not a book for Adsense Campaign Techniques,This book is more about the landscape of online marketing and provide very limited Adsense campaign techniques to generate reveune! Defintley not a good buy!
4,As Advertised,"We were needing a larger than standard card table with none available locally. Shipping was fast. This table appears well constructed, if you need a large table and are OK with the white color, we recommend."
3,Quality issues,"We purchased this table due to it being larger than some card tables. The table is very sturdy as expected, but there were some key screws (3)missing that hold the legs on properly. I did not notice this immediately when it arrived. Rather than hassle with a return,I put in the missing screws with some of my own and also some additional ones along the four sides. I expect it to last for years after my repairs."
4,It works for what I need,I didnt have any of the problems that everyone else seems to complain about with the screws and such. This is used as a work table for me for sewing and crafting. It is a little wobbly but not much and I think it will hold up for a long time.
4,Good sturdy table,"After having put up with two cheap, wobbly card tables, we wanted something substantially sturdier. In the short time we've had our Lifetime table, it has been impressive. It's not ""rock solid"" (which is why I rated it a 4 star), although it probably is still in the top tier in this field. Would definitely recommend it!"
1,What a disappointment!,"Exactly what we were looking for in terms of size and function. Yet taking it out of the box yielded a poorly constructed product that was received in numerous pieces-especially where the legs were supposed to be attached. Too much plastic that was brittle and consequently prone to shattering, and that is how it was received. Kudos to Amazon for accepting it back with a full refund."
2,Shipping 8 business days?,"Placed order 0n Jan 2, 2010 on Amazon. Did not receive from Target untill Jan 13, 2010. I have been using Amazon for about 3 years. This order was the most I've ever waited for. Maybe Target needs to kick it up notch."
2,Returned it,"Admittedly this table has a sturdy, good quality top, and as one person stated it's not quite 37"" but that was ok. Our problem was that the the legs were attached but we found several unused screws in the bottom of the box. When we turned the table over to look more closely there were 4 holes that were never drilled (so no way to put the screws in) and the legs were not completely attached. The other screws in the bottom were meant to go into already drilled holes (also supporting the legs) that were so wallowed out the screws just fell right out.Bottom line - we returned this table - somewhere along the way someone or some machine didn't do their job - and apparently no one checks to be sure it's 100% correct. If you do order, be sure to double check that the legs are attached correctly, that way there won't be any surprises if it all of a sudden falls over."
4,Sturdy Table for Inside or Out,This is a very sturdy folding table to use inside or out. It cleans up easily if used outside. My grandsons use it inside the house to put their Lego kits together. I find it has only one disadvantage. It is extremely hard to collapse. One definitely has to have lots of hand strength to get the legs folded up. Otherwise I'm happy with my purchase.
2,Below Standard Quality,"After reading the reviews about this table, I decided to ignore the warnings about screws missing, uneven legs, etc. and went ahead and ordered it. I should have believed them. My table arrived with one screw loose in the box, another one missing. I put the screw in but it doesn't go in all the way. With the other one missing, I have to go find one that will work. The table legs are not straight when unfolded. What is happening to the quality of U.S. made products? Once everything is fixed, the table will work fine but I shouldn't have to take the time to make these adjustments, nor should you if you decide to buy it. If you do buy it, just beware that these are shortcomings you might have to fix yourself."
5,Great for cross word puzzles,I'm very happy with this card table. It opens and closes nicely and has a lovely white top which can be used as an extra table for my family or a wonderful cross word puzzle table. Thanks !!
2,Poor Design,"The table top is great and the hardware, under the table top, is great. But, it just isn't designed very well. Every screw, connecting the metal hardware to the plastic table top was loose. I tightened every screw, but you can't really tighten it that much because the screws go through the metal and through the thin plastic. So there is nothing for the screws to attach to. I think this is why so many people have complained that the screws were loose or fell out. I know I'll have to periodically tighten the screws on my table.My table arrived on time, but the box was damaged. One corner of my table has a small dent in it and one of the metal hinges was slightly bent. These problems were not big enough for me to bother sending it back. The table top is sturdy and it looks great and I need it for a picnic in a few days."
2,Amazon sure does not pack well nor bill of ladings.,"This 37 Inch folding table is great.We bought a few from Amazon and other places at a lower cost basis too.From Amazon they arrived damaged but still usable. It was not packaged well. The Bill of Lading was a JOKE ( I HOPE) as it lacked any details.Why did the other shippers send them in great packages as well bills of lading ?Amazon we rATe 1.3 out of ten (10 ).The shipper AMAZON we Rate ZERO, ZILTCH, NY BAGEL HOLE , ZIP...At least the table we gave/delivered to the Seniors did not have to be in perfect shape as AMAZON shipped damaged goods sold as new but arrived as old used pieces marred.."
2,Freudian nonsense,"This silly book first appeared in 1972. Duffy knew a lot about imaginative literature, and the book is admittedly informative, but then she went and spoiled everything by applying silly Freudian explanations for every poem, play, novel or fairy-tale that she deals with. She saw incest, castration, phallic symbols, and all the rest of it in everything covered. A general collapse in the credibility of Freudianism has left this book sounding like the ravings of a woman with a dirty mind."
5,Life changing!,"I have always been a Tears for Fears fan from their dark synth offerings such as Mad World. They have always produced exceptional records (bar the lame 'Everybody Wants to Rule the World'...funny how this is probably their most popular tune!)I have felt that they matured well compared to many of the electronic groups from the early 80's.Albums like 'Elemental' showed the talent Rowland possess well but nothing prepared me for 'Raoul and the Kings of Spain!' WOW! What a phenomenon of musical genius. Every song is worthy of a standing ovation from the outset of the pounding 'Raoul...' to the tranquil ' Los...'It is a tragedy that the populus will never hear this album as they probably see Tears For Fears as another has been 80's group. Buy it, borrow it, steal it, sell your grandmother for it but whatever you do.. get it!! Your CD collection will be eternally grateful!"
3,Sorry...sorry is right,"as a big TFF fan I feel this was a weak album. There are some great sounds here, but the songs/lyrics were not as great. It sounds like Mr. Orzabal is going through an identity crisis...He needs to bring Curt Smith back and bring TFF back up to speed."
2,Overdone,"First let me say that I am a Big TFF fan, however this release has just a couple of good songs (God's Mistake and Me & My Big Ideas) but it is generally just overblown, over bombastic, and just doesn't connect with me. May I suggest Elemental or Roland Orzibals solo L.P. (Tomcats Screaming Outside)."
3,A dive off a cliff from the heights of Elemental,"Coming off the triumph of Elemental, this record is a dissapointment. Orzibol deciding to go for a concept album (the first for TFF since The Hurting) was a bad move at this point, as he didn't seem to have all the songs together to make it work. A lot of it is just pointless dabbling, or just filler. On the opening track he tries to go progressive but doesn't have the melody to carry it. This CD's best songs, like ""Me and My Big Ideas"" ( a self-parody by Orzibol on his idea of doing a concept album?) are not as good as the weakest tracks on Elemental (of which there are very few). The play-on-word references in the songtitles to the great work of Miles Davis and Gil Evans (i.e. Sketches of Pain) are nice; too bad the music here does not measure up to the level of Miles and Gil. When Roland did his tribute to the Beach Boys (`Brian Wilson Said', off Elemental) it really did measure- and was greatly fitting in that case."
1,False Advertising,"I am a long time admirer of Tears for Fears. Songs from the Big Chair still brings tears of nostalgia to my eyes, however this album like Elemental is a false advertising of sorts. Tears for Fears has always been progressive. From album to album, they have improved the recording quality, and composition of the songs, but slowly lost heart. This album totally lost me. I didn't connect with any of the songs and was even annoyed by listening to it. Still I admire Tears for Fears. I hope any future efforts by TFF transcend this album. Hokey voice effects and sleepy songs on this CD make me feel like I am not listening to TFF but some other incantation. Calling it TFF seems like false advertising to me."
4,Red and not so Red,"Well, I'd definitely have to say that the collection is a great idea with some really great looking girls in it, but has several girls that easily fool me into thinking they're brunettes. Good variety otherwise, and a couple of awe-inspiring girls top this video off."
3,"old stuff, but nice","The Playboy's recent DVD ""RED HOT REDHEADS"" is a pretty video, but old stuff: about 80% of the scenes consists of segments from previous videos. Among the few new things in the video, the scenes with Alexandria Karlsen and with Nicole Lenz are very agreeable."
4,OH yeah NOT too BAD...VERY EROTIC,As far as nudity goes I have seen better but I must admit the Girls do look mighty fine in the video.As the title implies...you are about to be transported to the future in FEB 2001.....so just lay back and imagine you are about to undertake an erotic journey into the future!
4,"If I can arrange flowers, so can you........","This small yet simple looking book, has taught me so many different ways to arrange various types of fresh flowers. Even my 13 year old daughter is able to make beautiful arrangements using this book. This is a great book for beginners. I hate to admit this, but my daughter's arrangements are better than mines......."
4,Excellent soundtrack,"This was the first CD I ever owned, and although it was released almost ten years ago, the music it contains has proved to endure the various phases my musical taste has undergone. This soundtrack is primarily comprised of acoustic, borderline alternative songs from would-be popular bands way back when. To compare, if this CD had been released in more recent years, it probably would have included songs from Avril Lavigne, Vanessa Carlton, and possibly Coldplay. All in all the Babysitter's Club Soundtrack deserves four stars, because of the fact that the true identity of the singers of the final track, ""Girl-Girlfriend"" is never revealed - not even in the CD book - which dissapoints fans of their vocal sound (the Beu Sisters are a good substitute)."
4,Too Short,"This is a great soundtrack. It has a great variety of music. I wish it had a few more songs tho, it only has 10. If you loved the movie, you'll love the songs from it!"
3,A Great Fit,"...between movie and soundtrack. These tunes weren't just thrown together or nudged onto the album with cash under the table, but are integrated with visual narrative seamlessly...my kids listen to Radio Disney which should be playing ""Girl-Girlfriend"" in heavy rotation..."
5,The Babysitter's Club Movie Is Fun And Heartwarming.,"The song being played at Kristy's birthday party on the BSC movie is called ""Hear"" by a group called ""Moonpools and Caterpillars."" And, that other song that goes ""hey ya ya ya ya, heyyyy ya"" is ""Never Let You Go,"" (if I'm not mistaken) by ""jakaranda."" Oh, and I loved the Babysitter's Club movie. Found it in the 5.50 bin and Wal-Mart. I had to search forever to find it, but, I finally did. The only special features are two movie trailers, though. It's in fullscreen, but, the picture is good. You can tell the age, but, still good. And, whoever said that the voices don't match the lip movements were wrong. They do. So, don't worry about that. All-in-all, I say that for a fun, feel-good film from 1995 that didn't win any oscars, the BSC dvd is a good buy, as long as you get it for under 10 bucks."
3,"It's ok, I guess","I don't have the soundtrack, I have the movie, but I personally think the music totally fits the movie."
1,Total Rip Off!!!,Complete garbage advertising. This did not come with the mini-disc or anything else. Just the 10 discs which were great...except there was only 3-4 different colors so lots of multiples.Don't get me wrong...these are great discs at a good price but I figured they needed a bad review to get the attention of the sellers.Don't advertise a mini disc etc if you are never going to include it. Apparently no one gets the mini-disc....see other reviews.Also try to not have so many colors doubled up....I got the feeling they were trying to get rid of some of the less desirable colors.
3,pretty good,"Pretty good album overall. It starts out strong with ""Welcome to my world."" The rest of the songs are pretty average. But this is being compared to their last 2 albums which are really really good. This album still has hillarious lyrics like the past 2 albums, but the music is just not as catchy as self titled and how to meet. if your a fan, pick it up, if you are new to nerfherder, get their self titled first."
4,Classics...you wouldn't expect yourself to love.,"I am writing this in 2010...as you can tell. This album came out many moons ago. I flipped thru my cable and on the Alternative channel they were playing Nerf Herder's Van Halen, I remember the song from back then, so I went to find it online...I came across a host of Nerf Herder songs, now if you have heard Nerf Herder before...and most people only know Van Halen you might think...well its ok...but please give this CD a listen. I read a few titles...Mr Spock? What kind of garbage is that. I gave it one listen and I was hooked. For a band who has childish ADD lyrics about nonsense they write some of the best most catchy songs you will ever here. I highly recommend Mr. Spock, Jenna Bush Army and just about all the songs on the album. They are timeless. If you have time check out the Mr. Spock video online. Its ultra geek rock..that actually rocks. I have since become a massive Nerf Herder fan...8 years late. BUY THIS ALBUM!"
2,Stale cheese!,"This is a pretty average cd by Nerf herder and is not on par with the s/t and how to meet girls but still produces some good songs like Jenna bush army, Mr spock and jacket. The track which insults the fender squire is probably the worst on American cheese as whats wrong with the squire it's the quality of the player what counts and the general concept of the songs pretty dumb. I'd get How to meet girls and the s/t release before even thinking of getting American cheese as it's not really up to the quality that nerf herder usually releases the humours even quite tame on American cheese aswell."
1,upbeat annoying songs we heard before,this band gives me a headache... this stuff reminds me of the the loud obnoxious kid in class that can't shutup.. but thats probably the appeal.. give me two tylenol please.
5,so beautiful,"this was a replacement CD, so I already knew I loved the music. One of my fav Christmas CDs by far."
5,I love it,You can not go wrong with Martina McBride and a Christmas album. This one is great and I highly recommend.
1,I didn't like it...,"I just couldn't get used to this album, but I really liked the Christmas albums from Lynn Anderson and Ralna English."
5,Martina sings old chestnuts - and what a voice !,"All these songs have been recorded many times before by many different singers. However, Martina has such a wonderful voice that I forgive her for not including any original material.From the opening strains of Do you hear what I hear?, the least-covered song here, it is obvious that this is a high-quality album from a singer who is inspired by these songs. Best of the lot is O holy night - although I've heard many covers of it, I regard Martina's as the ultimate performance of this song.There is a huge market for Christmas albums full of familiar songs and Martina knew it when she chose these songs. If you are looking for such an album in an easy listening style, they don't come any better than this.Note that in 2007, a new edition of this album was released containing all these 12 tracks plus four more. This version of the album remains available (at least for the time being) at a lower price than the 2007 version."
5,Puts you in the Christmas spirit!,How can such a teeny-tiny lady have such a powerful voice? Ms. McBride's choice of traditional Christmas carols and hymns is just right. It's 95 degrees outside but playing this CD makes me keep looking out the window for a glimpse of a sleigh and eight tiny reindeer......
3,"Same songs, different CD","I love Martina McBride.........she has an incredible voice and brings such emotion to the lyrics when she sings. However, I was disappointed when I put this CD in only to discover it is mostly a re-recording of the Christmas songs from her first Christmas CD with a few more additions. I was hoping that she would have re-recorded the songs differently....... oh well, I guess I should have listened first."
5,Love Martina,"I got this in anticipation of taking my parents and sister to her concert when she came to my city. Great sounds here, even better live!"
5,It's an awesom CD!,I love the classical songs. I've looked hard to find a version of Silver Bells I liked and finally found it. I love the harp on What Child is This and her version of Silent Night is gorgeous. This CD will definitely get a lot of use this Christmas.
5,O Holy Night,Want to be able to judge a Christmas CD quickly? If they play 'Oh Holy Night'...listen to it. A great vocal range is required. Martina knocks your socks off with this great song!!!
5,One of The Best Xmas cd of all Time!!!!!!!,"(...) Martina Mcbride does have one of the most distinctive voices in Country and Pop music.This Christmas cd IMOP is a tie with Amy Grants Xmas album,as the bset Holiday album ever.I love the way Martina did not put new Christmas songs on this.Instead she went with the classics.Which are better written than anything anyone has come up with lately.So if you want a Christmas cd that is well produced,well sung then get Martina's White Christmas.You wont be sorry."
5,THE BEST CHRISTMAS MUSIC AVAILABLE!!!,"If I could give this CD more than 5 stars I would. For years I've been looking for a CD that would play the best Christmas music in a way that preserves the original beauty of the songs. This CD finally does it. Too often a recording artist will change the melodies, add different rythms, or bend the original songs around his/her own style. In the end the resulting song is ruined by this messing around. Martina McBride simply sings the songs the way they were originally meant to be heard, and she does it with a beautiful style of her own which doesn't infringe on the writers original music. After hearing the CD I bought one for each of my family and friends for Christmas."
5,Favorite Christmas CD - Very Comforting to listen to!,"I highly recommend this cd to anyone.... whether you are a fan of Country music or not. Martina has done such an excellent job on this cd that you can't tell that her genre is Country.For years, I've been on the search for the ""Perfect"" Christmas CD. One that had all the favorites I remembered as a child singing with my family around the Christmas Tree. I FINALLY FOUND IT! :)Martina's voice is soothing and comforting on every song. I listen to it while driving home so I don't get over stressed over the holiday season. It's the PERFECT cd for Christmas morning breakfast or brunch!If you need to listen to any song sample for proof that this cd is a great one.... listen to ""O Holy Night"" or ""Silent Night"" and you will be convinced it's great!"
3,So much more could have been done...,"I haven't bought this, and I don't know that I will. I love Martina McBride, I think she has a fantastic voice, and I bought this CD the first time around. I think that when they decided to re-release this album, they really should have included a lot more than 4 other songs. It's a gem if you didn't buy it then, because you're getting a good deal. Those who bought the album when it first came out are now paying full CD price for basically four songs. I think that with as many Christmas songs as there are, this could very well have been a double CD."
4,Beautiful gospel music,"This is an inspirational and enjoyable work by Rev. Mlton Brunson and the Thompson Commuinty Singers from chicago, IL."
3,Easy until...,Hi my bud has this on Xbox it is fun and sort of easy until you get to the dancing part it is VVVVEEERRRRYYY hard to pass.I hope you like my review!!!!!!!!!
3,This is an older game.,This is an older game and it just does not compare with all the new games that are available today.
3,Keep Moving!-),It becomes rather monotonous rather quickly for lack of imagination in development. Will keep some toddlers busy for awhile but not long. A better underwater adventure game would be Nemo :-)
1,waste of time,this is soooooo dull and boring and the dancing parts are wayyyy to hard and dumb. Throw this in the trash can and get the movie instead
1,Not likeable by 3-year old.,I rented this game for my 3 year old. Who loves the movie. He tried to play it. He like it. I tried to play it & got to the dancing part. I couldn't get past it. I tried for 5 days. My rental time was up. I returned it. I haven't rented it since. This game is way too hard to beat. And my 3 year old got bored with it real fast. I would NOT recommend this game to anyone. Don't waste your money buying it. Unless you are an expert with video games. I'm just thankful that I rented it instead of buying it.
1,"To hard for young kids, too boring for older kids","I would not get this game because it is way too hard. The game is good until you get up to the part where oscar is dancing on the news. You will never make it! Before you get to the dancing part. A crab has to give you instructions. It's really weird, you have to circle around furniture to get it and when oscar is dreaming in someone else bed, you have to swim away from a deadly shark with red eyes. At the end of your dream, you hear the shark say ""hello"". Then oscar wakes up and says ""huh?"" The game was very boring! I don't think it would be good for any ages. It is either boring or too hard."
1,May induce vomiting,"Michael Bolton did it! He redefined the term ""lowest common demoninator"" and set a new standard for mediocrity. He took the worst aspects of Meat Loaf and 1980s power-balladeers and amplified them into total and utter DRECK. But it doesn't stop there! He desecrated the grave of Otis Redding with his soulless rendition of ""Dock of the Bay,"" jettisoning all laws of subtlety and transforming a classic soul tune into mall-ready drivel. I bet Ray Charles had wished that he was deaf as well as blind when he heard Bolty's version of ""Georgia."" This music is offensive to everyone but those with the basest tastes. If you possess even a molecule of self-respect, leave this one in the warehouse, type ""Otis Redding"" into that search box and check out some REAL music!"
1,You can't sing soul if you don't have one,"One of my friends likes this guy. Michael Bolton does to soul classics what William Shatner did to ""Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds."" Fortunately, Shatner was only half-serious. Bolton, on the other hand, seems to think he is actually improving on the original versions. He desperately needs to get a clue. Yeah, I know he's laughing all the way to the bank, but musical success is not measured in units sold."
3,"""Said I liked it....but I lied"".","I have a friend Jim who tried to turn me on to Michael Bolton. He used to listen to harder stuff like Nine Inch Nails, but stopped since he became a ""Bolton-head"". I do admit I like the song, ""Said I loved you..."", but nothing more than that. There are many artist's I enjoy, but none as much as I believe Jim likes Michael... My point is that, though I don't really get into Michael Bolton myself, he must be great because nothing puts a smile on Jim's face like when he listens to ""How can we be lovers, if we cant be friends"" and the rest of his greatest hits."
1,Bolton's Best CD-Shares His Pain Just With You!,"A horrible singer who looks like he is in intense agony when he is singing shares his pain with the audience. Massively successful, with many ""hits"" but the man is totally devoid of talent. It is hard to pick between Neil Diamond or Michael Bolton as the worst act playing today. Lucky Sony has them both!"
4,Should have been more accurate...,"This is the first greatest hits package by Michael and it's missing out on lots of material.Of course you do have most of the hits from all of the albums.Of course you get new material (4 songs, including his version of I FOUND SOMEONE which he wrote on purpose for Cher's 1987 comeback CD and the new Diane Warren-penned THIS RIVER).But what about all of the singles off THE ONE THING?What about all of those precious rare-to-find songs?Thanks God for the extensive booklet and great pictures.Sony really missed out on this one!"
1,please make it stop,"In the words of Bill Walton, ""horrible, just horrible."" This record shows that that Michael Bolton's idea of ""soulful"" means ""screaming"", with a very limited vocal range. All of the songs follow the same pattern: They start slowly, pick up speed, then GET LOUD, as if ""louder"" = ""more meaningful."" There really is no question of whether time will tell whether Michael Bolton is a great soul singer as some have suggested. The answer is simple: No.If you want ""soulful"" music, from a true soul singer, consider Otis Redding, Marvin Gaye or Aretha Franklin."
1,got fiber?,"Contrary to what the previous review said, it is not romantic music that I object to. Rather, my beef is with music that is poorly done and Michael Bolton's renditions are just that.There are many great romantic music artists and among them are Percy Sledge and Otis Redding, of whose When a Man Loves a Woman and (Sittin at) The Dock of the Bay (respectively) are butchered by Bolton into total oblivion.Bellowing at the top of one's lungs as if needing fiber in one's diet is not my idea of romantic. Michael Bolton has no real musical ability, and this causes his so-called vocal stylings to be very painful to hear.If you want music of romance, check out any of the original artists of his remakes as well as Tony Bennett or the King, Elvis Presley."
1,Scrape a folk across a chalk board,"If you take a fork, scrape it across a chalk board you will get a sound remarkably similar to the ""vocals"" of Michael Bolton. It will also be a lot cheaper than buying this CD.Please. Don't let this man ever enter a studio with the equally annoying Celine Dion."
3,"A few winners, some renditions of old hits, et al","I always liked ""Steel Bars"" very much, but it's quite different from all the other songs on this album. Mostly Bolton does ballads in a highly emotional style--which most people either love or hate. Personally, I'm into balance and would give this 3.5 stars if I could--mainly because of the (to me) very poignant ""Said I Loved You...But I Lied"" as well as ""Steel Bars."" Yes, his renditions of some old hits (e.g. ""Dock of the Bay"" and ""GA on my Mind"") are different. So? I don't expect to like every song on an album. Certainly, his own old hits have merit (e.g. ""Time, Love, and Tenderness""). I think ""I Found Someone"" is enjoyable whether you liked the original version better or not. I do think some of his background music is a bit overdone. And yes, he has a bit of a rasp--there are artists lots raspier though. I'm amazed by the extremist views of the reviewers, but then, music is in the ear of the beholder. Or, is it in the mind?"
1,his voice goes hand&hand with an upset stomach,"this guy thinks he is a soul singer.i wonder what planet is he from?boz scaggs can sing but you don't see him runing around saying that he feels like he is the next marvin gaye,or sam cooke or otis redding etc.. or darryl hall for that matter.he is a ok song-writer and after that he's done.when i hear him trying to sing i say it's ok the Pepto is in the fridge just like the rest of his music."
1,"Bad singing voice, bad music","Mr. Michael Bolton rates as one of the worst singers ever. What's with his voice anyway? Got some glass shards in his throat or something? Ugly face, ugly hairline, ugly voice, what else? Tell this guy that he should retire...permanently."
3,My Mistake,"I never really heard Michael Bolton before and though I give it a chance.Sorry, but none of the songs are original and he adds nothing to the old mix or creating trying a new one."
2,Moves you to distraction,Except for the rendition of 'Ooshton Hauston Bergasson' the rest is pretty flat.
2,Crap songs,"There are only 4 songs I like on here. They are Soul Provider, Steel Bars, How Can We Be Lovers? and Said I Loved You... But I Lied. I mean, let's face it, he's not much of a good singer, you don't hear much about him anymore (I'd like to see him make a comeback because his last ""Comeback"" album did not even hit the top 20 - V.poor) and also he tries too hard.Overall - 4 Good Songs. 2 Stars out of 5 Stars. 23%(1 star - 0-20%)(2 stars - 21-40%)(3 stars - 41-60%)(4 stars - 61-80%)(5 stars - 81-100%)A rather rubbish album and a not very representitive Greatest Hits collection."
1,PLEASE make the bogeyman go away...,"Listening to Michael DOLT-on pay his respects to ""Georgia On My Mind,"" ""When A Man Loves A Woman"" and ""The Dock Of The Bay"" is like having root-canal surgery without novocain. Who gave this arrogant, egotistical, no-talent HACK a recording contract?!?"
2,not my cup of tea,Gift for my aunt. When I was a child she would keep michael in heavy rotation in her tape deck I was mad as hell
5,My favorite CD,"I have a gazillion CD's but this one is my absolute favorite. I hate loud music but when I put this on I crank it up, can't get enough of it. No one can come close to the power and soul in Michael's voice. I am a professional singer myself and am a pretty good judge of vocal ability. I strongly recommend this recording."
4,Lovely bracelet for a young girl,I purchased this charm bracelet in silver for my 10 1/2 year old daughter and it is very pretty. Delicate enough for a young girl. Precious Accents was also a pleasure to deal with.
2,difficult to put together,"I'm an eye doctor and I've put together other eye models that are much easier, but are much more expensive. Thought this one would be fun. Not all the pieces fit well together. Poor construction and poor instructions. For the price I guess I should not have expected much."
1,Too difficult!,This product is way too difficult to put together. Directions are poorly written and not helpful. Several adults tried to put this product together with no luck. I can't imagine a child being able to assemble it.
5,So glad I found it,"I got this book from my local library branch and LOVED it. It's the perfect blend of humor and suspense. It's certainly not for young children, but a reader at a 6th grade level should be fine. I'm so glad I found it here because none of the book stores in my area carried it."
3,"okay movie, great performances","The movie's more like 2 and a half but I gave it the benefit of being rounded up. The movie is about a drifter who has an affair with his brother's neglected wife. The plot's been done before but the performances here are great and are what make the movie. Until this movie I had seen two Adrienne Shelly movies, Trust and The Unbelievable Truth. I could tell Adrienne had something but suffered under Hal Hartley's stagey direction. In Grind, she was finally allowed to become the character and show what an actress she could be. Billy Crudup and the the guy who plays Terry as well. They become the characters and I also like fact that the people in this movie are believable, realistic.Shelly is still in her late thirties and I hope that Hollywood gives her ""the role""."
3,Not that great!,"I ordered this because I tried it on in a store and I liked it. When I ordered it it wasn't the same one. I don't like how it was very cheaply put together and doesn't even look right when I wear it. I did however, get it in the mail within a week and it was very convient to have it shipped."
4,Nice,"I wore this under my wedding dress. I tried on a few bustiers, but this is the only one that was comfy and also got the job done. I like that it is seamless, and also that it is longer in front (I am 5'2"" to 5'3"" and it fit well over my hips)."
2,Too Thick & Bulky.,"This will keep you sucked in but it was way to thick and bulky to wear under my dress, I ended up buying another plain strapless Wacoal bra."
4,Great for holding in a tummy & smoothing but does add bulk,"I love this bra. Its definitely the most comfortable out of the 5 I've tried on. I just cant do front boning. It kills me. That being said, this bustier is good for sucking in a pooch. If you are already slim and just want some support, this probably isnt going to work for you as the front is slightly padded all the way through. It will add a layer. I got my correct size and didnt have any problems with the cup. But if you're worried about size you can always go to Davids Bridal to try on but definitely buy it here. 20 dollars cheaper!"
2,"Great cup, bad overall fit","The cup size fit perfectly, but the waist line did not. I have a long normal torso, but the material gave me pooched out hips and the boning was sharp in the back."
2,don't waste your money.,"Way too thick. I bought this to go under a bridesmaid's dress and it was just way too thick. Instead of pulling you in it actually expands you! My dress was a little big and this thing made it impossible to zip! I bought a regular Wacoal strapless instead which worked out perfectly, but this was a waste of $$$."
3,Not sure I like this,"Im not sure if I like this item. The sizing is off, I wear a 40d bra but I ordered a 42c. The cups are too big! But if I wear a bra underneath it it's okay. I have to wear shapewear underneath it or my belly is pudged out the bottom & my ""back fat "" is exposed.Overall I would not purchase again"
3,Readable. Implausible.,"This is quite readable. You do find yourself caring what happens next, you do find the characters stay in character - even if alien. There is a flaw in the whole series, I believe. The galaxy is dominated by beings too timid to pick up a gun, yet alone shoot it. This seems contrary to any selection pressures in any environment. Also humans are blood thirsty and enjoy war - all of them. Compared to the suspension of disbelief needed for the Spell Singer series I guess we can't complain"
1,"This is aluminum,not as advertised!","This wire is advertised as oxegen free copper strands,it is aluminum. Depending on the load of your application ,this wire may not suit your needs,never mind the fact it's falsely advertised. I am not happy at all with this."
3,ALL ALUMINUM as stated in other reviews,"Seems to be right size at roughly 8.5mm diameter, but still aluminum. Metal type needs to be taken into account when deciding proper awg size"
5,as listed,"Nice packaging - not damagedI also bought the red cable in the same footage to run + & -All arrived together in good shapeQuick, fast and as listed"
5,what a amazing film,"this film was amazing. as a actor it is so nice to see a film that truely captures the essence of a true experience. this film had my emotions everywhere from happy to sad. The performances are amazing. Mark is brillant and Laura Linny, you can not keep your eyes off her. Matthew Brodrick is always good and this is his best performance to date for me. the little kid is sweet and you know everything he is thinking. I highly recommend this film. Not a blockbuster but better."
4,a sad but grate drama,I thought some of it was just ok but then there was another some of it that I thought was grate. I say take it or leave it.
4,Surprisingly Good,"Most people never have even heard of this movie, and they are seriously missing out on a very uplifting and charming movie. Laura Linney and Mike Ruffalo play brother and sister. Ruffalo's character is a drifter, moving place to place, only writing to his sister occasionally. Then one day, he heads home, to re-create the bond between the two of them. And also with Linney's son. The movie is absoultely fantastic and everyone should watch it. Amongst the wonderful script and beautiful setting, there are suprising stars like Matthew Broderick. You have to check it out."
2,"camera has poor memory ;,no recommendation for memory card",Infromation on camera did not mention limited memory. Now recommendation for memory card in instructions. Poor job by Nikon. No recommendation for anyone to buy. Should include better manual. Unhappy customer.
2,BORING & LEAVES YOU PONDERING,"I seriously do not understand all of the five star reviews. This film bored me to death. Yes, the characters were believable & the plot was ""life-like"" but the acting was emotionless and the plot was slow, repetative & very dragged out. I sat through the whole movie only because I wanted to see how it concludes but I was sadly disapointed as the ending leaves the viewer wondering what becomes of each of the main characters."
4,Good movie for the family to watch,good for the family to sit and watch Thats about all I got to say.....feel good movie I actually stayed awake
3,Great performances - intimate to a flaw,"This is a story of a brother and a sister and how screwed up people's lives can get, but just a little too realistic for my taste. You really wanted something nice to happen to these characters, but the only thing I got from this movie was depressed. Technically the movie is as good as they get, the acting is superb and you really have to applaud the studio for releasing a little movie like this. As a study of acting and storytelling, this is a gem. But as entertainment - it leaves a little to be desired."
2,The film equivalent of 'Friends',"'You can count on me' is the indie movie 'Friends', where prickly situations about families and relationships waft in a feel-good haze. A case in point is the crucial bout of violence. The films of Shane Meadows usually feature such a scene, which have a tendency to break the fragile nature of the home or society in which it is played out. It's either bleakly final (24:7) or desperately covered up ('A Room For Romeo Brass'). Director Lonergan doesn't quite have the courage of this scene, and neuters it with tears, big smiles and hugs. This is symptomatic of the film as a whole, where even the mumbling are prodigiously articulate. And yet, deep down, the film's circular pattern, where a couple representing Happy Family die in a car, and a couple representing Family That Can't Live Together drive apart, suggests more searching themes. If the excellent Matthew Broderick had been central, you'd have had a more troubling film."
3,Unexpected ending,"There is no end at all. Everything goes back to it's original stage. Sammy is a poor little woman without love, family or anything she ever knew she wants, makes she happy, even his son is a load on her back.Who say this is real life ? This is a life people chose to live."
3,Trite plot that fizzles out,The plot is trite and predictable. The ending fizzles out and leaves you wondering if there wasn't supposed to be a sequel. Character depth is OK at best.
4,"Unusual story, good acting, interesting","The little boy is very good in this movie. I didn't realize it was Rory Culkin. I'm not familiar with Mark Ruffalo but he was great especially in scenes with Culkin. Matthew Broderick was All Too Real as a boss. The characters are all Smart and have opinions, even the child. This is a rare, intelligent movie that explores important subjects. I can't think of a movie to compare it too, so it is unusual."
4,ART FILM WITH BROAD APPEAL,"This is a very sweet, not maudlin, film of a brother and sister relationship forever bonded by love and familial obligation. Laura Linney and Mark Ruffalo are convincing and likable as siblings who share a traumatic childhood which matures them to the responsible (Linney) and irresponsible (Ruffalo) adults they've become. For being a so called 'art movie' which played in the smaller theatrical houses, it is surprisingly lightweight comedy-drama, never very demanding but engrossing nonetheless, amusing and touching. Rory Culkin playing Linney's 8 year-old son delivers an accomplished wry performance as the child at the center of the sibling's storm center. Although much different in dramatic content, I'm reminded of Martin Scorsese's, (credited here as a producer), ""Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore"", in it's similar folksy realistic view of the nuclear American family."
2,The plot is flat and goes nowhere,"I was surprised that so many people rated this movie 5 stars. The story line basically meanders through a short period of time in the lives of a sister and brother... and there seems to be no climax to the plot. It's just flat. It's not that the acting was bad -- I thought the actors were quite convincing in their roles; the story line just seems to go nowhere.I also didn't appreciate how Terry (the brother, played by Mark Ruffalo) used so much foul language around his sister's 8-year-old son Rudy (played by Rory Culkin).I like movies that make you feel good, and this one lacked that trait. It wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen... but I don't think I'd ever recommend it to a friend."
1,server,Didn't get to see movie server kept shutting down and after the third or fourth time ....just give up...movie looked good but the server needs fixed
2,Just ok for me.,"This movie was depressing but I gues more realistic then most movies that I typically watch.I prefer to watch movies that teach me something new (learn about a new place, profession, etc.), are very entertaining or are historical. This movie was just about lives of ordinary people that did not grow up in the best of situations. They did not rise above, they just pretty much existed and made poor mistakes with their lives. I could have done without watching this movie."
3,Good idea gone bad,"I was interested in the reality of this story. That's what got my intention to watch it. But then there were too many unrealistic scenes appearing. The end was a real disappointment. Cut off too nothing, leaving the viewer with hardly being able to imagine an ending. I wouldn't watch it again. Too bad, it was a good idea for a show in reality that happens in this life."
3,Can be based on a true story,Film's flow makes you think whether it is based on a true story. I am sure people would find similar stories around them
1,This was pointless,"You Can Count On Me...Ostensibly a tale of redemption this movie is basically a waste of theaudience's time. Laura Linney plays a successful single mother whoreceives with great joy the news that her rapscallion of a brother, MarkRuffalo, is returning home for a visit. Laura's character has stayed andprospered relatively well in the town they grew up in and Mark'scharacter seems to have hoboed around and spent more than one night injail. Somehow he connects with her son and apparently has an epiphanyand his character changes.OH THE HORROR! The plot was weak, the dialogue was a joke, thecharacters were poorly drawn to begin with and had no moments of growth.Oh wait, I know I said Mark's character had an epiphany but it made nosense and was never explained. The movie seemed to start in the middleof nowhere and ended with no resolution at all. Mathew Broderick hadwhat looked to be an interesting minor role for him and then just becamea waste of camera time. SKIP THIS ONE!!!!"
2,a real mystery,"I saw this movie soon before it was released theatrically. I knew the screenplay had won at Sundance, but there was virtually no hype or word-of-mouth. What I saw was an incredibly bland, boring film, a little dollop of sentimentalism that might have cut it on TV but as a film was a huge waste of time. Then the reviews starting rolling in, and I was totally dumbfounded. What movie was everyone watching? Mark Ruffalo does a great job, and Kenneth Lonergan's acting turn was a highlight -- but the screenplay?I should advise heartily against anyone's seeing it, except for the fact that everyone seems to like it. So here I am, forced to resort to these quiet little displays of baffled, anonymous dissent."
5,An excellent presentation of the subject,"Regardless of your current thoughts on the subject, this book will help you tie together any loose ends. It represents a very clear and easily-readable presentation of two opposite views of eschatology: futurism (dispensationalism) and preterism.Like most evangelical Christians today, I grew up learning and teaching dispensationalism. Many studies in Daniel meant I had the images and calculations down pat. However, there was a nagging doubt involved in stretching the 70th week out for over two thousand years. Suddenly -- and recently -- everything is falling into place.If you are unfamiliar with any other view of the end times, do yourself a favour and get a copy of this book. Both sides are very clearly presented. Read them and make up your own mind."
3,My Granddaugher Would Not Eat Them,I thought these would be similar to Animal Crackers but my granddaughter..who is not allowed to have a lot of sweets..would not eat them.
3,Well crafted,"I agree that Hemingway wrote well crafted stories. He was definitely a master at this. However, writing stories that hold the readers attention, is a quality that was lacking. Overall, the stories were dull and uninteresting."
5,Papa at His Best,"Hemingway, with his unique journalistic style, demonstrates in his short prose the efficient use of word and image to portray deeply enigmatic (and usually tragic) characters, situations, and human relationships. Reflective of both Hemingway's personal angst as well as the demons that haunted his times, the stories outline the love, joy, anger, frustration, and lonliness that have accompanied humanity from the start of time. Hemingway would have spoke to the Homeric Greeks as well as he speaks to us today."
4,A Classic,"I was reading the hard copy from the library, and knew it would take me too long to finish, so I plunked down the money for this one, and have not been disappointed. Hemingway's blunt force of language, describing with power the most mundane events, still inspires me. Read and enjoy!"
2,Library Binding edition incomplete,"Please read the Library Journal review under ""Editorial Reviews"" above. The ""Library Binding"" version is incomplete.Amazon has mixed together all the user reviews of the different editions. Pay close attention to reviews that discuss the quality of a specific version. Sometimes it is hard to know which version is being described."
1,"Hemingway, Ugggggggh!!!!","I had to read these stories in my American Literature class and I dreaded each time I had to pick the book up. Hemingway writes in a series of fragmented sentences that seem as if a 3rd grader wrote them. His stories are cold and unfeeling. My prof. lectures that it isn't what Hemingway writes that is important, it is what he leaves out. If he left out anymore he would have no stories to tell."
2,Short storys of Hemimgway,I am only 35% into it and doubt if I will finish reading it.It is not any fun to read
3,Classics,"While I enjoy some of Hemingways stories, this book is a collection of shorts. Not his best works. A good addition to complete a library. If you are interested in trying a hemingway novel, this may turn you off to an otherwise brilliant author."
4,If you really need it.,"I do enjoy Hemingway, but I don't think the Finca Vigia edition adds very much, except to the price. I could have stuck with the un-finca edition and still had everything important.The Short Stories (Scribner Classics)"
3,Earnest Hemingway complete short stories,"I found these stories a little too dark. Too much death. I have enjoyed quite a few of Hemingway's novels, but the short stories, not so much."
2,Sorry guys... Warren's got a problem,"I agree with everyone here that his music is beautiful, he's a master of pop hooks, knows how to write thoughtful, funny and wistfully emotional lyrics. But the problem is his singing voice. Just not a big fan. He doesn't really have too much vocal range and that's disappointing because the songs he writes are so pretty. Same thing with the Pernice Brothers (although not as bad).-- Mpls DJ"
3,not what I expected,First the classification is misleading.These are Audio CD's NOT Videos to be watched or taught from.I did not get what I paid for.Unless I am missing something only one CD is the learning of remote viewing...the others are guided experiments.I suggest you look for another product if you are serious about learning this...I am disappointed!
4,A long time favorite,"This is one of the best trashy historical romances I have every read. Playboy Paperbacks put out a number of these back in the 70's. This is really a lost art form because authors today just concentrate on the trash and forget the history, characters, plot, etc."
5,Silos Relevant and Rocking,"The Silos have long been carriers of the torch for indie American Rock and their newest release, HEATER, lives up to that billing. From the beauty of ""Thanks a Million"" to the raucous ""Stoplight"", Heater will have you mesmerized throughout. It is easy to hear why so many bands site them as influential in the development of their own sound. A must buy."
1,The Silos Go Insane,"I'm a long time fan of the Silos, all the way back to their only major label album (self-titled, 1990). All I can ask about their latest is, what happened? I could barely stand to listen to it once. Gone is the laid back, country tinged rock that the band cut its teeth on. In its place is what can only be described as, depressing art rock dreck. If you're looking to buy your first Silos album, go with the classic ""Susan Across The Ocean"" or the excellent ""The Silos"" instead. A sad decline for a great band."
4,Attention fans of Genshiken!!!,"This series is loosely based on the metafictional anime/manga introduced in the Genshiken series. Released in 2006 in Japan, this version of Kujibiki Unbalance does not follow the exact same storyline as the ""Kujiun"" OVAs found in theGenshiken: Economy Collection, although it does still follow the antics of Chihiro and friends as they attempt to accomplish the tasks dealt to them by the student council. Overall, it's a cute little anime that stands pretty well on its own. Fans of Genshiken will enjoy watching a fully formed storyline, from beginning to end, involving the characters of the anime/manga that our favorite otaku are obsessed with.Each volume also includes a Genshiken OVA, which introduces Oguie Chika's character into the storyline. Also, for those who aren't familiar with this or the Genshiken series, this anime contains adult themes and, as such, is not recommended for children."
2,Maps,"Even though I listened so many times and tried to be fair as possible, I must say that album has a good start but bad finish. Monotone throughout the album."
3,Bungee Cargo Net,There is really nothing wrong with this item. It shipped in a timely manner and was designed as advertised. The bigger issue is that using this is like trying to herd cats. Perhaps the problem is that long bed trucks are not designed to accept all the hooks on the cargo net. I ended up running a stringer around the base of the truck bed and hooking the cargo net to the stringer. It worked but it was messy.
4,good product,"Good product and as decribed...I have no complaints with it except it isn't quite as ""stretchy"" as I would have thought. However it gets the job done and pricing was good. I would recommend and purchase again if needed."
3,Nice-looking but not exactly what I was hoping for,"These boot covers are nice looking but aren't exactly what I needed for my son's costume. First, they have a silver buckle at the top that is NOT pictured. I was hoping to use these covers for my son's Incredibles costume but the silver buckles make it a bit difficult. The second problem I have is that they are just too big. Although this may not be a problem for bigger kids, there was no indication about the size - just that it's a child standard. My son is a tall 3-yr-old and these boots go up his entire leg and he could easily fit both legs in one boot cover ... this just won't work for the costume. My mom is an excellent seamstress so I am hoping she can work her magic and come up with something usable with these covers. Fortunately, the price is definitely right so I'm not stressing over that. I'm sure these boot covers will work well for some kiddos (for costumes only - too much use will definitely show on these), but not for my little guy."
2,Maybe ok for beginners?,"I am always looking for new FIRM dvds. I have never had one with Ali as an instructor so I bought this one based on Amazon reviews. I did not care for it. First, Ali is very nice but not a great instructor. She miscues or cues too late, and her voice is very sing-songy and annoying. I know that isn't relevant to the workout, but it was something that really got on my nerves. Second, this dvd recycles many of the moves you see in other FIRM workouts. There are very few new moves and even the supporting cast looks kinda bored. Third, this workout just did not get my heart rate up. I used 5 and 8 lbs weights and still was barely challenged, and believe me, I'm no bodybuilder. There is one segment where you do weird dance moves that are not only silly but also ineffective. I was definitely disappointed with this workout. I would only suggest it for beginners and even then, you might be annoyed."
4,A nice step between basic and intermediate work outs,"I purchased this DVD in a case that came with three others - Hardcore Fusion, Cardio Party, and Cardio-Overdrive. This video is a nice blend of cardio and toning with weights (5, 8, and 10 pounds). There are a few odd cues here and there, which tripped me up the first time around. I've done the video about 10 times since then and I have no problem with the cuing. I am certainly stronger now! This was a great way to get me from sitting on the couch to having more energy and stamina. Recommended if you're bored of beginner videos."
2,too dance-y,"I thought this workout was way too dance-y, and the cues were given too late. I've been doing the Firm workouts for years, but had a hard time being able to keep up with the cardio portions of this workout due to the unfamiliar moves. I did this workout after having done Jackie Warner's Power Circuit Training the day before, and Hard Core Fusion didn't feel like I was working much of anything. I think I'm hooked on Jackie Warner's training, and I can already see results of it. Very disappointed in this purchase."
2,Pro Stock Drag Racing of the 70's,"Great photos, but the text has more misinformation than Howard Dean."
3,Nice photos,"Plenty of good photos. Lots of color photos. The b/w photos are from great b/w drag racing photographers, like Charlie Gilchrist (you can see more at [...]).I've docked two stars because of the captions.There are obvious errors that don't correspond to the photos (eg, ""Sandy Elliot"" driving the Sandy Elliot Comet when usual shoe Barrie Poole's name is lettered on the window), plus spelling errors that are evident from the photos, so I don't have a lot of confidence in any information that isn't directly based on the photos."
3,Petra's Best Song - But Not Much Else,"This is probably Petra's most frustrating album to me. The title track is my favorite Petra song and one of my all time favorites in any genre. But unfortunately, none of the other songs have ever caught my fancy. It almost seems (and I know it's NOT the case) like Petra threw together an album of hastily written and produced songs to surround a landmark song like ""No Doubt"". Even with the average remaining songs, the title track is so good that this album gets three stars just for bringing us that sensational tune. Instead of spending the money on the album, LEGALLY download the title track and save your cash!"
4,Better than most,"Petra evolves even further from the talented musicial line up of yesteryear, with an album containing one or two distinct evolutions in their unique sound. God, himself, must have rejoiced upon hearing the band imported a new guitar player to replace aging, spiritual hipster Hartman. Songs like Think Twice and Two Are Better Than One, show brief flashes of Hope. But that pathetic ""more than a thousands words"" song, exemplifies why so many people hate ""christian rock"" and Petra in particular. It's the musical equivalent of a honeydew melon. This album is an embrace of the 1990's which they tried like hell to avoid. A champion effort from christian music's favorite dinosaurs."
3,hrmmm,i was reccomended this cd because i rated no doubt's self tiltled debut (a ska album mind you) 5 stars. i didn't rate it that because i liked the name it had more to do with the music
1,When the Cracks Started Becoming Obvious.,"Petra's decline musically started with Unseen Power in 1991. Brown Bannister gave them a brief shot in the arm with Wake Up Call in 1993, but No Doubt (which reunited them with the Elefante brothers) was a horrible disappointment. The best track on the album is 'Think Twice' which comes close to sounding like Nine Inch Nails. The rest of the album contains a tired mix of formulaic Aerosmith styled rockers with what have to be most soulless ballads ever put to tape in Christian music.Petra have always chosen to take a 'vehicular' approach to its music - ie the music is no more than a 'vehicle' for communicating its message. Sadly, this has resulted in the most mediocre of art."
3,Not their best,"If you're after a rock album to listen to, I'd suggest ""More Power To Ya"", ""Jekyll And Hyde"" or most other Petra albums. The albums is not bad, just not the classic rock album you would expect from Petra. It is all very middle of the road and does not really have any stand out tracks."
1,Beware of books with too-cool titles,"Although the too-cool title made me suspicious, I got this book because I read an excellent review of it (on this page). I was hoping to read a forward-looking thesis on multimedia avatars, but got instead a book which should have been called ""Having Fun with Director."" It's not about programming, artificial life or avatars. If you have never heard of genetic algorithms or object-oriented programming and think the internet is an incredible source of useful information, then perhaps this book is worth a quick read. Otherwise skip it."
1,Requires Caution as the Bits Grab on the way out!,"I have used one of these for a few months in my drill press and I have had several scrapes to my hands. The problem is that the cutting end is very aggressive and as soon as it cuts through the far side of the work piece with the pilot tip, the drill bit tends to break through the material and grab it - spinning it rapidly. I am not exactly a novice with using a drill press. Any bit has some tendency to do this and you need to clamp the work piece, have a backer piece under it, and slow down the feed just before the drill exits the other side.The worse case using these bits is in drilling thick polycarbonate plastic - it's tough and these blasted bits grab every time on the exit. I have had similar but lesser problems in brass and aluminum.I finally gave up and plan to sell the set in a garage sale - buyer beware! I have gone back to the standard point type bits.These bits are an accident waiting to happen in my opinion."
5,best drill bits ever,Very good drill bit set super sharp and they last as long as you keep bits oiled up when drilling thick steel will buy again
2,pros & cons,"all in all the bits set are good , however when drilling thru industural steel studs they break they don't seem to be design for high speed drill (electric drill) they also kills the batteries in cordless ones with just a few drillingsDEWALT DW1361 Titanium Pilot Point Drill Bit Set, 21-Piece"
1,Too aggressive,I'm a home remodeler. I've had this set for a couple years and am not happy. The small bits have worked fine. The larger bits will actually start to thread into the wood like a screw. Being extra careful to apply light pressure the drill will still twist out of your hand. I thought maybe I was doing something wrong so I asked my father (also a remodeler) to try them. He had the same problem. We didn't have the right size bit to drill a hole in our boat. We rolled the dice and use this set again. Not good. Splintered the fiberglass and made a mess. Now I'm looking for a different set.
5,The Deer Pasture highlights family,The Deer Pasture is centered in the rustic beauty of the Texas Hill Country. Author Bass tells the story of the deer pasture and its significance as a family traditon.A collection of 17 essays. Each essary contains a wonderful story of the Bass men and their fall deer hunt. A good read for everyone.
2,Mixed up tail,"Mills and Boon meets Hollywood. Mawkish voice over drives the plot. Confusingly blends European mermaid legends with Stateside Christianity. Neither realistic nor fantasy. Lacks dramatic tension and the plot develops clumsily. Mid life crisis artist (Bassinger) goes to isalnd community where her mother has deliberately chopped of her finger to emulate a mermaid saint. Whilst there has an affair with a monk before finding out the link between her fathers death and her mothers detached finger. The monks sat mending pure white fishing nets in the immaculately lawned Country House hotel which is their monastery must be a metaphor for something, but what? Putting brain into sleep mode recommended before switching on the DVD machine."
4,nice movie,"good movie, liked the book alot and the movie did not disappoint. simple story, easy to follow, a relaxing watch."
2,Terrible performance from Kim Basinger,"I enjoyed the novel this movie was based on - and was quite pleased to find it among the Lifetime offerings on OnDemand. But...what a waste of two hours. Kim Basinger is terribly miscast as the lead character, a woman dealing with painful memories of the loss of her father and with a mother who seems to be going mad. Basinger delivers all her lines as if she's reading a bedtime story to someone she's trying not to rouse, very breathy and whispery, and her emotional responses seem to run the gamut from A to B. She's surrounded by a capable supporting cast, but it's not enough to save the movie from her dreadful performance.At least, there's comedic value in her cheap-home-perm 1980's hairdo!"
5,Great book!,"Easily my favorite out of all the Survival this and how-to that books out now, wish she'd write something else damnit :)"
3,The book lacks what the title says,This book has more of a comical approach to the apocalpse.It was an alright read but don't be looking for good info on survival.This is a fun read not a serious one.
3,this CD does not break any new barries,"Overall, it's an honest work. John Mayall is a British blues authority and an overall British sound and mood is delivered indeed. On the whole, nothing new under the sun. Some songs are catchy and pleasent to listen to, others not very so. Harmonica playing delivers the goods and some tasty guitar work can be spotted here and there (dig the final lick of the solo in ""Sensitive kind"", a-la Otis Rush). Unfortunately, on the other hand, the Korg M1 piano tone is really cheesy, and the piano player is all over the place. You find yourself wishing him fingers arthritis to stop the mess he's doing!"
2,Folklore or a college course?,"I knew this would be a book on King Arthur and the Grail, what I didn't expect was a meandering tale of his mother Ygrane, his sister MorgueLeFey, Merlin, and devils named Lucifer, Loki, and the fairies ( called here as Daoine Sid ). I am wondering about the mention of a dragon slumbering at Earth 's core and a world tree. This story gets very loose in its weave, and uses a lot of ancient folklore magic and beings."
3,Not as tough as other Extreme Kongs,My young lab (less than 1 year) started to destroy this Xtreme bone in under 10 minutes. The good news is that he liked it. The bad news is that this extreme kong is not as good as some of the other versions he has (such as the extreme kong with spikes).
5,Tough to Destroy,"We have 2 English Bull Terriers (think Target mascot). They can annihilate purportedly tough chew toys in under 4 minutes. These Kong red bones are the ONLY toys that last in our home. The dogs pull each other around the house and out in their play yard with these, chew them, and toss them.We actually get our money's worth out of this product."
3,not for power chewers,"8 month old lab puppy has pulverized every chew toy purchased with the exception of his black kongs - so I took a chance on this one, knowing it was the 'medium' size and might be too small for him.That said, I did not expect that it would be missing pieces in under 30 minutes. See uploaded picture.I had hopes that since the black kong toys are the 'extreme' it would prove a bit sturdier."
3,Not as durable as the main Kong Extreme,"My golden retriever/cocker spaniel mix is a major chewer. He's had the Kong Extreme regular treat toy for months now without so much as a dent in it, and he carries it all over the house to chew on. When we got this ""Goodie Bone"", we thought it'd be similar in durability... However, because of the way the holes are cut in the ends, he ripped apart pieces of the bone end within an hour of us receiving it in the mail. Bummer!"
5,"Cute idea, but my dog is satan",I was so excited about this Kong. I thought maybe this one would last with my terror of a pit/lab mix. It lasted about 3 hours. I'm sure with a normal dog this toy would be great but I didn't pay close enough attention and I ordered the small one (mistake #1) then I made the second mistake of actually giving it to my monster jaws of a dog. This would have been perfect with my little mut I used to have. This is a good product though and a great idea to keep the small pups busy for a while.
2,Dog doesn't play with it,My lab doesn't seem to like chewing on this bone as much as some of the other kinds I've bought for her. The goodie slot is only good for specially made ones designed to fit in there. It's been sitting in my dog's toy box for a while and never seems to get used.
3,Good tug toy,It is OK and seems to be long lasting. It took a while for my gog to get used to it and now he likes it more.
1,Did NOT last!,Very disappointed in this toy... our two dogs destroyed it within 5 minutes of having it. We were watching them and they were playing with it when all of a sudden they it in two pieces... very disappointed.
2,Treat holes too small.,"I bought this version because the red goodie bone was starting to break apart after fairly light use. That one had nice holes on the ends that my small treats, <1"", fit into perfectly. This one however has much smaller treat holes. I can't fit anything in there without using so much force the treat crumbles in my hands. The rubber seems much more durable but I'll never know since I can't get any treats in it. I'm very disappointed they made the treat holes essential worthless on this model. Obviously it is made only for the treat paste, which is mostly junk food."
5,Very long lasting!!,"We have a real chewer at home and she has not managed to tear this into shreds and we have it for months, at least. I don't put treats in it and she still loves to gnaw on it and even retrieve it."
2,"KONG Goodie bone dog toy, large",This toy lasted a little longer than most. Took our Lab a good 30 minutes to rip chunks off the end.
2,Not strong enough for my dogs,"Generally I am a big fan of the KONG brand dog toys. They are usually very durable, especially considering my dogs can chew anything to shreds. This bone did not hold up well at all. It was ruined within a half hour of getting it home. If you have a strong chewer, I would not recommend this bone, stick with the traditional KONG or some of their other stronger toys (treat ball, etc.)."
2,Expensive 15 minute toy!,Love most Kong dog toys. Gave this bone to our new large dog to keep her stress level down when we first got her. First time she tried getting the treat out she tore a big chunk off the end. Hmmmmmm. I'll stick with the original Kong.
2,Extreme?,"I have an english bulldog that loves to chew. He's pretty good about just chewing on his toys, so we constantly make sure to have a new stock of toys for when he destroys his current flavor of the week. We purchased this item from the local pet store. Most of these Kong products have seemed to last a bit longer than most. This bone lasted just a day as he quickly had one end ripped off the bone. The best part was that he wasn't able to shred this into millions of small pieces. None-the-less, if your dog tends to go through toys as fast as ours, then you may want to choose a different toy."
1,Not so extreme,"The moment I took these out of the box, I knew our dogs would chew through them in an hour. The holes for stuffing treats gave them a good place to grip to facilitate tearing them apart. What the dogs didn't ingest ended up being marble-sized chunks of rubber all over our floor. If it weren't so inexpensive, I would have gathered up the chunks and returned them for a refund. Definitely not satisfied."
1,Disappointed,"I bought an XTreme Kong long ago & it is the only dog toy that has withstood the powerful jaws of my dog - an XTreme chewer! I decided to purchase a few of the other XTreme products manufactured by Kong, hoping they would be as long-lasting. This product, the ""XTreme Goodie Bone"" was a big disappointment as it was chewed up in a matter of minutes by my dog. I would definitely NOT recommend this ""Goodie Bone"" to any pet owner that has an aggressive chewer."
3,Not for my dog - Very extreme chewer,"We bought this for our yellow lab puppy (just under a year old) and she tore through the entire thing within 24 hours. She's a very extreme chewer and has gone through at least two Red Kong bones as well. We bought the black thinking it was going to be more durable. Won't buy this for her again. If your dog just likes to gnaw, though, and not necessarily tear things apart this is a great brand! My husband's family always used them with all of their dogs and none of them ever went through them. Was hoping for a more durable toy for our pup who can get through anything and this wasn't it. But again, she is a very extreme chewer. Got through this in under a day."
1,Disappointed but not surprised,"We received the dog bone and my St. Bernard mix dog immediately began to chew on it. To my disappointment, within 20 minutes he had broken it into 3 pieces and was trying to eat it so I had to throw it in the trash. Although the product appeared sturdy in nature, it broke apart at the ends with pressure from chewing."
1,torn apart within 20 minutes,Purchased this product for our 4 month old border collie mix. She had the outside of the nubs at each end of the bone completely chewed off within 15 minutes. This product is definitely not for a chewer!
3,little interest,"My pitbull mix dog loves most of the Kong toys, and I like them because they actually hold up under her very strong jaws. However, she has no interest in this bone toy, so it simply sits in her toy bin."
1,Not for big dogs,Bought one of these at the pet store because they assured me no dog can destroy it. My German Shorthair had it in a pile of rubber pieces before we made the 15 min drive home. Not for strong chewers.
3,Not for aggressive chewers,"I stick with Kong products b/c my dog (a shepard mix) can chew through anything in minutes, this Kong bone was no exception. She got through the sides of the bone (where the treats go) by the end of the night. Ok for normal chewers I suppose, seems hearty enough, but not a good pick for aggressive chewers"
2,Not for heavy chewers...,"Good thing these other owners don't own Milo the yellow lab of doom :) If your looking for a better toy hit the westpaw toys section. This lasted about 10 minutes and it was in chunks on the floor and one down Milo's belly. Thankfully he ""disposed"" of it later the next day.Not recommended for HEAVY chewers despite what the previous reviews say!"
1,The Rubber Deteriorates into Goo!!,"I've bought two of these KONG Goodie bones for our Lab (a red one and a black one)and both of them melted on the ends. We had the red one first, and since we tend to rotate his toys to keep him interested, I had put it up on the shelf over the kitchen cabinet. After a while, I went to get it and got gooey, sticky red rubber smeared all over my hand. THe ends of the bone were all soft and melty. At first I thought that it might have been too hot up there, but that didn't make sense....it couldn't have been that hot...I live in FL with the air conditioner running 8 months out of the year. With the black one, I put it away in a different place, away from anything that could affect it, or so I thought. Sure enough after a couple of months, when I went to get that one, it had done the same thing. They both had a bad chemical smell too.Maybe my dog has toxic spit? Who knows, but I would never buy these again."
1,POOR QUALITY!!,"Within 15 minutes, my 40 lb labradoodle chewed through this toy supposedly for extreme users! We have used black extreme Kongs in the past with our 200 lb English Mastiffs with no problems. Kong has apparently moved to very poor quality on their toys. I would NOT recommend this- you will just have to throw it away before your dog eats it!Very annoyed and disappointed."
3,"My dog loves it., but....","My 10 month old miniature Australian shepherd loves this toy. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be tough enough for her. I bought this because she had nearly destroyed all the other Kongs in the house, along with the Nylabone Galileos. I put treats in it, and within about 20 minutes, she's ripped it to shreds. I think she figured, why struggle to get the treats out, when I can just make the holes bigger? I'd hoped to get something tough enough that it would be safe to stuff and leave when she's home alone. This toy isn't it, but she does like it, so we'll probably still use it with supervision."
3,Red vs. Black,"I love Kong merchandise, but am a little disappointed in this particular product (LARGE/RED Goodie Bone). The reason is that it's a big, beefy, thick bone that really seems targeted towards dogs with powerful jaws. I have a medium-sized Vizsla that is a moderately enthusiastic chewer, but by no means above average. The large, red Kong lasted 7 or 8 minutes with him, then split near the goodie holes on both ends. I always supervise him with toys, and immediately noticed when he pulled off a chunk of rubber about the size of a bon-bon so as to prevent him from eating it.There must be a considerable difference between the red rubber of this product and the black rubber of the Kong Extreme, because the medium-sized Extreme usually lasts 2-3 weeks with the same dog. I think the red version is best suited to gentle chewers."
4,Sturdy bone,"Kong extreme good sturdy bone. However, the hole for inserting treats, see protruding star like ends on picture, allows for dogs to pick at and get a chunk of plastic out of pretty easy. If the protruding pieces had been turned inwards my Pip probably would not chewed through this as quick."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this from Amazon for our 68 pound lab mix. Extreme KONGS are the only things she can't chew up, so I thought this would be great - a new shape to play with! However, she had pieces of the ends in a matter of minutes.Although it comes with a tag that says KONG, I question whether it really is the KONG company that made this (it doesn't say KONG on the bone, it says something else). If you have a strong chewer, this probably is not for them."
1,Gone in sixty minutes!,This bone lasted all of one hour before my dog had one end shredded and all over the room! This was recommended to me after my dog destroyed all her other toys. Well another one bites the dust!
1,Still looking for a chew bone for a smart dog,"Seems durable, but it lost to our Cock-a-Poo!This is a nice bone, our dog liked us putting treats in it. But he is an extreme chewer and the area where you put the treats was picked apart within an hour of receipt. Our dog is a 25 pound Cock-a-poo with sharp teeth. Wish I could rate higher...I would love to find some success with a bone for this dog."
3,"Go for the bigger, stronger Kong","I bought the bone-shaped treat Kong for my 115-lb. lab, Riley. He has a huge mouth and very strong jaws and pretty much decimates any dog toy I bring home within minutes. This was no exception. The ends of the bone where the treats are hidden were ripped open and little black bits were left discarded on the floor. So, maybe this isn't the best toy for your strong-jawed pup- but for a more moderate chewer it would probably be fine."
3,Large Kong,"This Kong Bone appears to as strong as they always have. But they have changed the diameter of the opening. It is now about the size of a dime and was previously a little more than a nickel. If you plan to put kibbles in it, it might be OK because it would hold them more easily. But we have always use it for putting peanut butter in it. Because the size is so small, our Golden retriever cannot get to the inside. Therefore there is always remnant peanut butter in it that we must clean out. I'm going to try and enlarge the opening with hopes of making it more like they used to be. But as it is made now, it is not what we need for our purpose."
4,My dog loves this toy!,Kong makes the best chew toys for dogs. This is very durable and fun for the dog. It bounces and you can put small treats in each end of the bone to increase your dog's interest in the toy. This toy also stays very clean and does not get smelly like some chew toys do. My only complaint is that I have to buy the very tiniest treats to fit into the treat compartments on this toy.
3,Not so Extreme after all . . .,"I have a big dog, but not that big (only about 60 lbs) . . .Anuways it didn't take long for him to demolish it . . . In fact, it almost seemed as if my dog's red KONG bone lasted longer than the ""Extreme"" black one . . .But overall, I would say there is little difference between the black bone and the red bone . . .The only reason I gave this product 3 stars is because my dog, Tobi, had a blast with it and as long as he enjoyed it, it's okay with me . . . to a certain extent that is . . ."
3,Goodie Extreme not so Extreme,"I was hoping this toy would last with my dog who loves to chew. Well, it lasted only a few days. She ended up shredding the ends of the bone so I had to throw away. The other kong toy that is round worked well."
5,Great Chew Toy for Tough Chewers,"My dog loves the Kong chew toys--especially the Kong Goodie Bone and the Flying Saucer Kong. Both are really good for tough chewers. For some reason, my dog likes the black Kong Goodie Bone better than the red one."
3,Not as good as the Original,"My dog - a lively border collie - plays endlessly with the original Kong Extreme toy, with and without a treat inside. I purchased the Kong Extreme Goodie Bone Dog Toy as a new chew toy for him, but it did not hold up well. Within a month, he had chewed threw the ends of the bone and we had to throw it away. Meanwhile, the original Kong Extreme Dog Toy looks like the day we bought it."
2,openings can be chewed up,I was unhappy to see the openings chewed up and the bits consumed by my corgi. So much for the extreme kong bone. The beehive is lasting but this bone had to be tossed way too soon for the cost.We will stick with West Paw Hurkey which shows no wear.
2,Not for strong chewers!!,"Kong makes some great toys for strong chewers, but this item is not one of them. We purchased this for our puppy, who also decimates toys, as the other reviewer's dog, and the ends where it holds treats got destroyed quickly. I think the rubber housing for the treats is not of a great design. Dogs with sharp teeth can immediately break off the nubs on the inside where the treat would go, and start cracking the rubber on the ends. Not recommended by us; stick to the original Kong shape."
1,Do not buy,"My 6 month old lab puppy broke this in half, twice. Kong usually has great products but I do not recommend this item."
2,Big Dogs,I purchased this and several other Kong toys for my Pitbull puppy. She had them torn apart within minutes. Not practical for large dogs.
4,would be 5 stars but man it smells!,My dog cannot chew this toy up! He is a 25 pound cockapoo but chews pretty much every toy that I have bought. Only down side is his breath smells like rubber after playing with this/
5,KONG is the King!!,"This is a sure win! Our two dogs play with it constantly! And so far...1 month later... our Golden Lab hasn't shredded it to bits! He carries it around, leaves it out in snow (until he's sent back to get it) and is entertained for hours with a little peanut butter stuck inside the end holes. I should have ordered two!"
2,Not for a strong chewer!,"Santa left this for our runt-of-the-litter yellow lab. It didn't even make it through the day. To be fair, he weighs a little more than the recommended weight, but, comparerd to other dogs we have have had, is not a strong chewer. Definitely disappointed in this particular Kong purchase."
3,Better for a larger dog,My 11 pound poodle does not have the jaw power to properly enjoy this toy. I think 15 pounds minimum to properly enjoy this toy.
5,Good for bored dogs!,I have a golden retriever (1 yr old) and she loves toys you can stuff with peanut butter. I like this better than the original kong because it's easier for me to stuff and it has two places to put the peanut butter. Keeps her entertained for a good while. I like to give it to her when I know we'll be gone for a few hours. All kong toys (except their frisbee...) have been incredibly durable with a mouthy puppy.
4,shower head,this product was sent promptly. It was packaged cleanly also. It was nice to look at by color and detail and fit right in the nozzle here in my bathroom. It has a clean fresh water filled spray. I am well pleased
2,Just O.K.,"I was actually a little bit disappointed in this purchase. The ""flap"" is in the same place on the same side of every page. Not very interesting or challenging."
1,Came in a 3 pack - threw this book out!,"This came in a 3 pack of Katz books (which in general I really enjoy) but although this book is titled Sharing, it does not teach about sharing! It only teaches your kids to give a friend a different toy and selfishly keep their own toy. I only read this once and quickly got rid of it. Terrible message in this otherwise pretty book!"
1,How to compromise..,"This book is NOT about sharing. Every situation offers an alternative, never is taking turns mentioned or even playing with a toy together.I do not think I will read this to my son again."
1,Not sharing,This book gives bad examples of sharing. For example instead of sharing one cookie the author suggests giving a second cookie to the second child...
3,Pages Rip Out Easy!,"I love all the books from Karen Katz but all of her ""Lift-the-Flap"" books' pages rip out so darn easily, especially if you have stubborn little ones like mine who like to read and turn the pages themselves. I would recommend getting Board Books for your little ones."
1,I Can Share,"I purchased this book for my daughter who has loved every other Karen Katz book we've bought her. This book however is NOT about sharing. Instead, this book teaches children that they don't have to share, but just offer another one to their friend so they each have one."
3,Not really about sharing,"This book is okay. I was a bit disappointed in that it's really not about sharing. On each page, the child doesn't want to share the toy they're playing with. On the reveal page, the child ""shares"" by giving the other child a different toy to play with, or something similar to that effect. It would have been nicer, to see the child actually giving the same toy to the other child to ""take turns"" or sincerely ""share""."
2,I hide this one from my toddler,"I understand that we don't always share everything, but in this book even a thing that can be easily shared like raisins is not really shared (the child mysteriously produces another box of raisins). I also hate the way that every page begins ""MY ___! YOU CAN'T USE IT!"" because now my 2-year-old walks around using this language about all his belongings, which he never used to do."
2,"NOT sharing, more like ""Alternatives to Sharing""","This book is crap! I bought this for my toddler and wish I hadn't. My daughter already shares very well and I wanted to reinforce the behavior so I bought this book. Instead, this book doesn't teach how to share but teaches alternatives to actually sharing."
4,Great Introduction to Sharing,"My 17-month old was very familiar with the word ""MINE"" so I bought this book to help us introduce the concept of ""Sharing"" with her. It worked great. She loved the pictures and lifting the flaps and I have caught her ""reading"" this one on her own later. She definitely understands sharing now and this book really helped us show her how much happier everyone is when you share. Definitely worth the price. The pages are a nice quality, too, that won't easily rip.I wish this had smaller flaps like some of her other books, though. It's more fun for the baby to lift the small flap to reveal a surprise instead of lifting the whole page the way this one is set up. The baby doesn't understand how to put the page back down before turning the page, so the whole book ends up with the pages sticking out when you are done and it gets a little confusing. That's the only downside."
2,A little strange concept,"Is this sharing in the 2000s? I found this whole book very peculiar. No, I'm not sharing my stuff with you - but I can try to give you something else instead. I can understand that's how it works sometimes -- but it is it really sharing. Very strange book."
1,A sharing book with very little sharing involved,"We have been given a lot of the Karen Katz books for my almost-two-year-old daughter. I'm not a huge fan of any of them, but my daughter likes the bright illustrations and the flaps so we keep them around. But this one is the worst. Nearly every ""sharing"" dilemma is resolved by something other than actual sharing. You can't play with my doll, I'll let you play with a different doll; I won't share my raisins, but I'll give you your own box; etc. It really doesn't teach kids to actually share AT ALL. Very disappointing and headed to the Goodwill box."
3,Too short...,"This particular one is a foot too short. Unless you are a 5 ft tall DJ, it will be too low for you. And you had better not bump your setup during a gig or this thing is going down. Just not very stable around wild partygoers. Ok for a bedroom Dj, though. I'm sticking with the Double X stands."
2,Less Than Brilliant,It says on the container for this video that it was brilliantly filmed by Bertrand Tavernier. My own view is that there must have been a lighting technician strike. Far from being brilliant the film I saw was dim to the point of obscurity. Many scenes might have been on the radio. This is not good cinema.One wants to see something discernible on the screen. Neither is there anything original about the story except for the eastern European setting.Yes there was a campaign in the Balkans in World War I. Yes French poilus fought there.Yes the Allies won the war. Yes there was an occupation after the war. And yes war brutalizes those who are in it. Kipling wrote a poem about the thin red line of heroes whose successful use of violence is prized in war and deplored in peace. This film doesn't tell us anything new about that. I don't think it could have been new to the French either.
3,good story but movie too dark to be watchable.,Capitaine Conan is a wonderful story about an obscure time in world and military history - the post-WWI expeditionary forces which tried to keep a lid on bolshevism. Good acting too. But half the scenes in this movie are so dark I couldn't see what was going on.
1,Terrible Book,"Someone told me this was similar to Black Lace books. Nope. It's not. I couldn't get into the story, and I don't remember much of it. I just remember being disappointed because it wasn't a good read, black lace or otherwise."
4,Dark Family Drama,"I honestly can't ever imagine giving an Iris Murdoch novel less than four stars. Her books are almost uniformly well written and compelling. This is no exception.The Italian Girl tells the story of an unhappy family on the eve of the death of the family matriarch. The characters include a spartan typesetter, two witchy Russian siblings, a disappointed housewife, and (of course) the Italian Girl.I don't find this novel to be one of her strongest (not compared to books like The Bell or The Sandcastle) but then again, I can't imagine a book of hers that isn't worth reading."
3,The Italian Girl,"It is a huge pity that such a good novel is spoiled as an ebook by so many ""typos"" that come from poor scanning I suppose. Surely there should be proofreading after a book is scanned and before it is sold as an ebook?"
3,"OK, wasn't much to choose from in 2005","At the time, there wasn't much out there so it was all you could get to transfer stuff from one computer to the other. The program kept freezing and I'd have to close and restart often. Worked OK I guess."
5,Cachao: the originator of the Latin Caribbean sound.,"Cachao, a cuban, was the originaot of what is now known as Salsa. His danzones, mambos, and descargas are known world-wide as being the best of the best. He is also deemed one of the greatest bassists of our time. His music in this album is excellent, especially ""Spoon Lips."" Well worth every penny sent."
4,"Before the Drive-By Truckers, there was DNC...","It irks the heck out of me how Drivin'n'Cryin' has been written out of music history. Their combination of eloquent folk/bluegrass stylings alternating with screaming loud Southern metal leveled an entire generation down here where I live.DNC's basic premise was pure genius: that there was nothing inherently wrong with the *concept* of Southern Rock; it simply failed in execution because the lyrics were at best cretinous and at worst racist. So DNC put literate, empathetic lyrics to it and voila: the blueprint of Americana, y'all.""Whisper Tames the Lion"" is a good starting point to get to know DNC. ""Powerhouse"" is one of their legendary showstoppers to this day, and ""On A Clear Daze"" and ""The Friend Song"" usually feature in singer Kevn Kinney's solo performances.Eclectic, dramatic, exciting stuff, and no Americana fan should even think about missing this."
3,They've Done Better,"""The Whisper Tames the Lion"" is a spotty but often interesting album from the Georgia rock/country/folk/blues outfit Drivin'n'Cryin. The sound is typical of the band, though the album itself is not quite up to the standards of ""Mystery Road"" and ""Fly Me Courageous,"" their two best albums. The highlights inclue the excellent afterlife ballad ""Check Your Tears at the Door"" (a fine example of thier quirky side), ""Good Day, Every Day"" and ""The Friend Song."" The album suffers mainly from the inclusion of a number of less than stellar filler tracks.Oveall, ""Whisper"" is a decent album for fans, but more casual listeners should start with the other albums I mentioned instead."
2,Shirtless Men Sell.. Period,"The cover drew me in... yep I'm a gay manand the only thing I liked once the case was open was two tracksif that.. so I'd say if you want shirtless men, buy that booknot this CD..."
3,Good value for Money,"Definitely better than the Q as F Season 2 soundtrack. This has been put together by those that provide most of the music for the show, it is a bit patchy and to claim that none of the tracks on this CD have appeared on any of the official Q as F CDs is a lie. However, what is good on this CD is exceptionally good and even after 6 months its still on high rotation in my stereo."
3,a few good tracks,this cd was a good buy especially used i has a good diversity of songs especilally tracks 4 5 7 8 9a great asset to any house music collection
3,Hodge-Podge,"This video seemed like a few instructors just got together and went through how to use several pilates props. It doesn't seem well thought out, although the technique and instruction are sound."
5,Sugarcane on Fire,"This is a smokin' recording. I actually sent a cassette copy of my LP to Sugarcane in Pasadena after I saw him in about 1997 at Village Music in Mill Valley, CA with Dewey Terry. It was an in-store performance and I jumped at the chance to finally see one of my jazz violin heroes from the 1970's. Sugarcane signed all my albums and asked me to send him a copy of PFDA, which I did. He didn't even have a copy of his own. Incidentally, the one and only Ry Cooder played guitar off to the side with Don and Dewey that day. A remarkable little get together for an audience of probably not much more than 50 people."
4,Fun read - worth picking up,"I definitely enjoyed reading this book and am keeping an eye out for the Corwin's next book. If you're looking for a light, fun read check it out."
4,Morgue Mama gets it done,"This mystery novel moves along at an exciting pace. Corwin brings the characters to life with realistic, every-day traits, yet doesn't bog down the reader with superfluous meanderings. I enjoyed getting to know the sleuths, and had a great time tagging along for the ride as the story raced across the pages to the fantastic ending."
2,Not for the average Backpacker wanting to pack lighter.,"This is not a useful book for the eastern Backpacker, who has been carrying 55-60 lb. on the AT and wants to reduce his pack to a 20-25 lb. pack load, without going to the poor house in the process. The book lacks personality and feelings about why we backpack.This is a highly analytical book on the technical aspects of Lightweight Backpacking in the west. Be less clinical and enjoy the experience a little more.This book is for those who mainly buy at the high end and at a few select sources. It is also assumes that most backpackers live or pack near or west of the continental divide. It does not mention our many fine supply houses in the east, nor the different environments we encounter in the east."
5,THE BEGINNINGS OF SHIRLEY AT WORD,"THIS SHOWS YOU WERE SHIRLEY CAESAR IS COMING FROM . SHE JUST KEEPS ON REINVENTING HERSELF . THE HIGHLIGHT OF THIS ALBUM IS THE WAY S.CAESAR SINGS JESUS IN ""JESUS,HOW I LOVE CALLING YOUR NAME"" I LOVE THIS ALBUM AND THIS GOSPEL SINGER/PASTOR"
4,"Basically well done, though marred by language inaccuracy","Dr. Wise is a learned man and presents his case well. There is, however one point on which he contradicts himself because of his incorrect use of one word,"" penultimate."" Sadly, it is a critical point in his discourse, because this one incident casts a shadow over what otherwise is probably excellent scholarship. His misuse of the word is neither inconsequential nor accidental, as he uses it with emphasis in two places. On page 76 he states, ""Man is the last (the penultimate) creation,"" and again on page 139, set off under its own heading, ""What's Next?"" he writes, "" And now, the penultimate creation--the origin of man."" He may mean ""last,"" but uses a word which unequivocally means ""next to last."""
3,Not a biography by any means,"This book was somewhat disappointing. The author is a friend of the royals, which I knew beforehand, but the book itself is primarily pictorial, with publicity photos of the royal family, but also many photos of each ""era."" The result is a very superficial and non-informative book."
1,"Sick of throat cancer, anyone?","I guess if you're a pimply-faced dweeb who likes having some moron sound like he's had his larynx removed, then this would be for you. All the so-called songs sound the same with this jerk screaming unintelligible rage into a microphone, while some no-talent one-chord idiots bang the same noise in the background. You're better off sticking with Justin Timberlake or some other useless boy toy. At least you can understand what he says.:^D"
5,A fantastic reference,It's hard to believe that one person was able to compile a reference such as this. Anyone interested in the meaning of scientific words should rush to purchase this book before it goes out of print!
1,Wasn't what was advertised,"I ordered this watch because it was shown that it was a ""NEW"" watch. It wasn't. It was obviously a very used watch with an original Valjoux 7750 movement in it which is a 17 jewel and not a newer 25 jewel version. The rotor was not the decorated one but a plain one. The case and dial are the same and this is a gorgeous watch but you could tell the bracelet had been sized and the identifying marks on the back of the watch had been very wore off. I was disappointed it wasn't new. I will still be in search of a new one since this model is no longer in production. It took about a month to receive a refund."
2,sketchy,I paid $500 for this watch and the bezel broke within 6 months. it feels pretty cheap although the movement looks cool through the back. I wouldn't recommend this watch. Also the hands never lined up right...terrible purchase on my part.
4,The Jay-Gee's were down with Kool&The Gang circa 70's,"The Kay-Gee's were younger than the members of Kool and the Gang ,however they included Kool Bell's younger brother Amir-Salaam Bayyan(Kevin Bell),and Kool himself would perform on various Kay-Gee album's alongside other members of The Gang. They were at the time signed to Kool's label ""De-lite"" and managed to produce 4 albums while at that label. ""Kilowatt"" would be their last and most popular album,the track ""Cheek to cheek"" was a popular club track when it debuted in 78'. A mixture of disco and funk,while heavy on the horns would best represent the Kay-Gee's sound."
3,Don't look for meaning on this disc - crank it up and enjoy.,"This is Brian having fun - loud, fast, and showing some sly wit. Don't buy it if you're searching for meaning in your life - you're not gonnna find it here. What you're gonna find is a guitar player just having one heck of a blast. You're welcome to join him....."
3,A deal for the money,"Overall the item performs well. I use it to cut styles, rails and raised panels for cabinet doors. This model includes a dust shroud for chip pickup by a collector which is helpful when using on curves and other applications. Only drawback: When adusting the the the cutter head height I have to estimate additional travel of the head when the cutterhead lock is applied. Overall it is a good deal for the money espectially if you're on a budget or novice wood worker."
1,do your self a favor and buy/build a router table,"I've used this machine on several occasions at the shop where I work. Delta has many great products in its stable, but this is not one of them. First off, the machine is way too light. a router/shaper (...) should be heavy in order to reduce vibration. Secondly, the top is cast aluminum. Good Lord, and with those horrible grooves. And my final point (though I could go on ad infinitum), the table is too small."
5,"One of THE most memorable,and moving, film EVER!","One of THE most memorable films I have ever seen! I think I saw it first in the early '80's and made a vhs tape of it off the Satellite so I could watch it again and again, and share it with friends. Dennis Christopher was great. Was just watching his earlier stand-out performance in ""Breaking Away"" and was distressed to find out that ""Don't Cry..."" was NOT on DVD. What will it take?"
5,I Love this movie,"If you haven't seen this movie, you need to buy it RIGHT NOW. Very touching and gives a different view of what was happening with the orphaned Vietnamese children during the war. An absolute heart breaking yet riveting movie."
3,O.K.,This video is good for children who want to learn about an orchastra. It is hard to keep a younger child interested (2-3yrs). Adults will probably enjoy it with their children and take the time to review the parts of the story with the child so it will stick. I rate it average. Good for kindergarten and such.
5,An excellent multimedia DVD,"Great fun for toddlers, older kids and adults! Even though I find Baby Bear 10 times more annoying than Elmo, I can sit through this one as much as my toddler wants. It's also an excellent showcase of DVD technology with the interactive games and other special features on this disc. One minor issue I have with it though is the menu that requires two selections to get anywhere. (Almost as annoying as an ""Are you Sure?"" dialog box)."
1,Mostly Filler,This is supposed to be an introduction for kids to Peter and the Wolf. Both Peter and the Wolf are overwhelmed by rhe padding needed to make this into a 45 minute DVD. Elmo and his friends trample the story to sell the disc.
2,Please.... mommy put something else in,"This was the worst Elmo dvd yet. It lost my childs attention thoughout the whole movie. Then only part that he actually watched was the very beginning. This movie is nothing like Elmo in Grouchland, or CinderElmo..... which were great and my son will sit and watch both of those over and over again..... they really captured his attention. He loves them!!!! Unike the Peter and the Wolf movie. I would not recommend this at all!"
1,complete disappointment,This disk is a lot of sesame street characters and very little music and very little of the original story. I did not even bother to give it to my grandchildren... just threw it away. If anyone wants to hear the story of Peter and the Wolf read to the original music... get something else.
1,WHAT WERE THEY THINKING?!,"I BOUGHT THIS DVD FOR MY 2 1/2 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER, WHO LOVES SESAME STREET, WHAT A BAD MISTAKE. THE DVD WAS IN OUR PLAYER FOR ALL OF ABOUT 10 MINS, AND I LOOK OVER AND THERE IS I ONE OF THE SESAME CHARACTERS WITH A POP GUN GOING TO LOOK FOR THE WOLF. I TOOK IT OUT SO FAST HOPING THAT MY DAUGHTER DID NOT SEE HER FAVORITE CHARACTERS PLAYING WITH A GUN. SHE HAS BEEN WATCHING SESAME STREET SINCE SHE WAS BORN AND SHE LOVES IT, I USED TO LOVE IT TOO. NEVER GIVING ANY THOUGHT TO THE NEED THAT I WOULD HAVE TO WATCH THE DVDS BEFORE HAND TO SEE IF THEY WERE APROPRIATE, BAD ON MY PART, BUT JUST HORIBLE ON THEIRS."
3,Not enough Elmo for younger toddlers,"This is cute and clever and my older son, who is four, truly enjoys it. This may not be the best choice, however, for younger toddlers who are just discovering Elmo. It was given to my older child when he was 18 months-old and it sat unwatched until he was three because it didn't hold his attention. I've had the same experience with my youngest son, who is now 18 month-old. He adores Elmo and enjoys other Elmo videos very much, but the segments in this story where Elmo himself isn't present, and there seem to be a lot, don't seem well-suited to very short attention spans. The musical segments are a bit more sophisticated and the storyline itself requires a bit more maturity than the other Elmo videos.This isn't meant as a criticism because it is charming and educational tale, it's just a caution that, in my experience, this one is better suited to the video collections of older toddlers and preschoolers."
3,okay i guess,"i dont know this albums alright. its totally not what i expected. now dont get me wrong i love 7 Seconds. but i was more expecting something more like Walk Together Rock Together. this album has some preaty good songs on it, i really like the Sham 69 cover. this album by no means should ever be considered hardcore. i mean this album sounds more like Green Day than Minor Threat. actally it sound a lot like Green Day, very punk-pop. its still miles away from Good Charlotte s**t. so if your going into this album thinking your gonna hear some hardcore you may be disappointed. but this is good punk-pop. if you really want some good hardcore pick up Punks not Dead by The Exploited or Damaged by Black Flag. so all in all an alright album."
5,Good ballet shoes,I bought these for my 8 year old daughter. They worked great! We had to buy a size bigger than she usually wears though.
2,"Good price, but elastic ties not good","The price was good. The fit was okay. The shoes only lasted a week on a very active 8-year-old. Not impressed with the elastic ties. Couldn't get them to stay tied and one worked its way out of the shoe. Researched a solution, and the advise was buy new shoes! Not happy having to replace them after one dance class. I went with a different shoe the second time around."
3,Ballet Shoes Run 3 Sizes Small!,"I bought these shoes for my daughters ballet class 2 sizes too big thinking they would fit. Wrong! You have to buy them 3 sizes too big. They are quality ballet shoes, but the size 13 I ordered were smaller than the size 11 that she currently was wearing. I had to go to Payless to buy here a pair of ballet slippers. Be careful if you buy these ballet shoes!"
4,"great shoe, 2 sizes too small","Thank you to the previous reviewer, who suggested buying 2 sizes up. I did that and they fit perfect. It's a very beautiful shoe with very soft leather."
5,Sooooo Good,Nothing better than a relaxing bath at the end of the day and this Kimono Rose is the best preperation for a good nights sleep.
1,DO NOT BUY,Smells horrible and tasks wrotten. Tried four different cans all the same. HORRIBLE!!! The one star should really be negative
5,Worth the Money!!,I thought this book was great. It was easy to understand and I wasn't overwhelmed by too much information. It has a lot of great ideas but also helps you come up with ideas of your own so your shower will be personalized for the guest of honor. I liked it! It was worth the money!!
2,Just the basics,"I was a little disappointed with the book. It has all the basics, but nothing unusual or innovative. (I also bought ""Themed Baby Showers"", and found it more interesting and helpful. It was only $8.00, had some simple illustrations.) The Ultimate Baby Shower Guide had no illustrations, other than photos of the author's friends' children. It does contain scriptures, which were a nice touch, but I was disappointed the book wasn't more creative. I had hoped for something really unusual."
5,"Fabulous, underrated American Rock Band","Wow---back in 1998, I had the pleasure of seeing these guys live at a tiny show at a Santa Clara University basement. Jeebus they were good! They also hauled around an entire B3 organ to get that ""real"" organ tone. Glad I bought this CD and met the band who were very cool."
5,I WANT THIS THING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is #1! everybody hates this doll compared to how much i LOVE her!i want this doll for cristmas SO MUCH i can barely go to sleep.5 stars, everyone!5 big fat stars!!!i'll share what i like about her if you want.- her eye details are fantastic- the painter did a beaautiful job on the face- i love both her outfitsand much, much more!!!!! there is so much more to write but i can't find the words!!!!! so, SEE YA!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"It's been said already, but...","Having loved the original 'Dark Fall', I couldn't wait to play this one. For the most part, I wasn't disappointed - but I have to say, as a few others already have, that this game is very much let down by its ending. It's not just that the ending is abrupt, or leaves some things unexplained - it leaves EVERYTHING unexplained. While lack of closure is forgivable (if often annoying) in a novel, I really don't think it has any place in a point-n-click adventure game. Never mind not finding out what happens to the missing people the main character is meant to be finding, you never even establish why or how they went mad and disappeared in the first place. Seeing as this is the basis of tht plot, the lack of explanation is a failure which - in a game genre where plot, however far-fetched, is reliably concrete - does not come off as artistically open-ended, but just sloppy."
1,Mixed Genre Disappointment,"This is a game which cannot make up it's mind (I know that people created it) as to what it wants to be. Is it going,as advertised,to be a creepy adventure story? Is it going to be a scary whodunit? Is it going to be a horror filled thrill ride? No,No,& No. It is a boring, plodding sci-fi wannabe,detective story maybe,brain-teaser oughta-be, ripoff! Not creepy,graphically ridiculous (there are more scenes and interesting content in a Mighty Mouse cartoon) with a plot so loose that it needsKaopectate. I love a good chilling adventure but this ain't it!"
5,Adidas Country II,I used to wear these when I was a deep sea diver in the navyback in 77-81. We ran 10k (6.2 mi) everyday. I went through 2 pair back in the day. These shoes feel like a custom leather glove once they're broken in and look very cool w straight leg jeans. They carried me all over the back alleys of Europe. ;-) Can't believe they are making them available. Word to the wise. Mine just arrived. Go up a half size.
2,A Towering Bore,"""The Tower"" is a port of the 1990s game ""SimTower,"" which itself wasn't all that interesting. Here's the entire premise of the game: you place offices, condos, restaurants, etc., in your tower, and you sit back and watch them make money. That's all there is to it. If that sounds boring, it's because it is.The graphics aren't that great, either. This game is definitely not worth your money."
5,sandy patti songs,"cd in great shape, the packaging was great the devilery was very fast and I did not have any problems with the order."
5,"Perfect for anyone, i promise you that","it may look small on the screen but once you get you will be suprised on how big it is, both sides have a nice sound, the materials are very very good and it will be very difficult to stop playing on it, this is worth the price, i actually think i got a bargain for this kind of practice pad"
2,Look for another drumpad,It looked ok - but the padding comes apart after a little while. The glue that holds the padding is no good. It is a shame because the rest of the materials are good and it is a good size. I complained to the seller - but no response. Keep looking my friend - this is not it.
5,No Complaints,"I bought this with the intentions of practicing rudiments before buying a complete drum set, so know that I'm not an experienced drummer by any means. Still, I think it's really high quality and two friends of mine (both drummers) complimented it the first time they messed with it. Versatile, good size, no complaints. If you're looking for a pad, it doesn't get much better than this for the price."
2,"Pad Curled, not the best feel","We ordered this pad and it came promptly, however the edges of the pad started to curl within the first few days. My son found he missed being able to screw this onto his stand. After returning this pad as defective, my son's drum teacher bought a new Acquarian Practice Pad and my son liked its action much better."
5,Hide In The Dark And Fight Loneliness,"Composed by Ghostland, Natacha Atlas and the distinguished Sinead Oconnor; ""Guide Me God"" is perfect for an underground incognito sleazy exotic dance-floor. Suited for individuals who can watch someone run their fingers down a chalkboard over and over while pleasuring from the feeling down their spine. Because that is just what Natacha Atlas's depressed moans are going to do to you...I was surprised to find the imports of ""Guide Me God"" available in the Sates. I'm sure the quantities are limited- due to the limited number of consumers who appreciate this kind of music.There are plentiful remixes for someone to find their favorite one. I was surprised the original song of ""Guide Me God"" was not included. It is amazing to see how different someone can make a song.For people with the same taste as I, may God guide you and find you soon.I'll always know your there,NicholasBasinger..."
5,From this moment on,This is a delightful album with many favorites songs. Richard is excellent when it comes to piano.
5,uplifting!!!!,the music on this CD goes straight to the head and the heart.therapeutic I would say and very uplifting.the price is high the Music on this CD does wonders for the soul.this is a must buy.
3,"Good , but not great.","Let me first say that this is not the first YMAA product that I have ever owned, I am very familiar with their products. This DVD goes into great detail about the origins and history of Shuai Jiao and touches on some of the techniques. In my opinion, they should have titled it an ""Introduction"" because it does not go into much detail. If you are a Sanda or MMA Fighter like me looking to add effective throwing to your fight game this is not the DVD for you. It is geared towards general instruction and foundation training in Shuai Jiao. Also, very importantly, if I spend money on a DVD I expect all this involved to be good at what they are doing. Dr. Yang has to correct his students too often while they are demonstrating in my opinion. I know we all make mistakes but It wastes time on the DVD, time that I paid for. All in all I don't think it is worth the price, there are other good competitive Shuai Jiao DVDs out there."
2,Ehhh.....,"This was a very strange book. I must say that I expected more after reading the reviews. It was not scary, just unnecessarily gory. The only character that was at all likable was Solly the golden retriever. I just didn't like this book very much. For having a lot of action, it came off as a story being told, with cliche wording and odd phrases that just seemed childish, not edgy e.g. ""trying to turn Solly into coleslaw."" Most of the people were wooden and the plot was more ridiculous than anything else, with a lack of motivation/explanation behind it. All in all, this was disappointing."
3,"Almost, Not Quite.","It is very hard to mix humor into a plot involving Nazi spies in New York City. Yet that is what was attempted here, mostly without success. ""All Through the Night"" has its moments with Humphrey Bogart as a big city gambler trying to crack a nefarious crew led by Conrad Veidt. There is lots of sharp dialog, banter 'twixt Bogey and his pals, a fine supporting cast and some tense moments. Watch for cameos with Jackie Gleason and Phil Silvers. The transfer to DVD is also very well done but in the end the mix does not gel. This was the very next movie after ""Casablanca"" for both HB and CV. Perhaps they missed the discipline imposed on that set by helmer Michael Curtiz, a tough taskmaster. It's always interesting to remind ourselves that the stiff-necked Veidt was actually a British citizen in his final years."
4,Clothes are alright,"Winx Club is fun! Some of the stuff is a little hard to get on, but you can NEVER find another toy that even comes close to matching the clothes on the show. Yeah, the clothes here appear on the show itself and I was glad to get this for my little sister's BDAY, she loved dressing her Bloom doll in actual clothes Bloom wears. :-)"
5,great,"Pendant was beautiful. Got it super fast. Was a bit smaller than expected, but was the size listed online. It's hard to judge how big an item is based on given dimensions, but it was perfect."
4,Good but confusing to the beginner,"I haven't been playing guitar for very long (only 2 years) but in that space of time, my love and admiration for the Pumpkins has grown to often monstrous proportions. When I first bought this book, I was excited. I was excited because I was going to be able to play all of these great songs that I've admired for a long time. But when I looked at the complexity of the sheet music, I was overwhelmed. In short, there is ALOT of confusing things in the book. I'm pretty good at reading sheet music (e.g. timing, coda, crescendo, etc..) but I often got lost. If you're not too good at reading music, you might get more confused. But, if you're willing to put in the time, or if you've been playing guitar and reading music for a while, this book is pretty good. The Smashing Pumpkins are one of the best bands around. Buy their cds. They rock."
5,Great Tab book!,If you play guitar and like the Smashing Pumpkins then you should get a copy of this book. It teaches all of the songs and techniques the Pumpkins use. I love picking apart the songs and figuring out tunings using this book. I also recommend the Siamese Dream tab book. If you are considering buying this book do it! You will love it!
5,A Beautiful work of pure Art,"The cover art alone would be worth the price of this exceptional selection, and the music far surpasses that. ""Tonight tonight"" is, of course the big draw, but you can not over look other great selections. It starts with an instrumental that can bring a tear to the eye, and ends with a soft song bidding you goodnight. In between, with songs like ""Bullet with Butterfly Wings"", ""An Ode to No One"", and ""Beautiful"", you have an exceptional album here."
2,Just an average book with come cheesy lines,"The book was fairly good in tabbing out the music. I thought that some of the lines could have been omitted, though, such as: Tons-o-fuzz in Bullet With Butterfly Wings (which is actually a Fender Blender fuzz effect). If you want to learn to play these songs, just listen to the album and do not waste your time on buying the book. All of the songs are easy to play. Just tune down a half step for most of them."
1,Wretched and self indulgent.,"When Carlos Fuentes writes well, he is a joy to read. When, however, he wants to demonstrate how learned he is, his writing is insufferable. This novel falls into the latter category. It is ostentatiously erudite and belches Fuentes' obsessions with highly esoteric questions. It is a cold, inhuman novel, devoid of warmth, fascinated by the process of narration itself and ultimately overly intellectual. If one had to create a list of works that exemplify the death of literature, ""Una Familia Lejana""would have a well deserved spot on the list..."
2,Disappointing sequel,"I found ""A Very Brady Sequel"" to be disappointing. I enjoyed the first movie better than I thought I would, and was excited when I heard they were making another. This movie is sillier than the first, and the script appears to have been written in about 6 hours. It's basically a fantasy movie that has almost no sense to it. The Greg-Marcia relationship would have been interesting in a different type of movie, but not for ""The Brady Bunch"". I guess if you're 16 and younger, you might like this sequel, but that's about it."
3,JUST AS GOOD AT THE FIRST ONE,A VERY BRADY SEQEL IS A GOOD MOVIE IT IS A LOT LIKE THE BRADY BUNCH MOVIE BUT MORE OFA WERDER PLOT STILL A GOOD MOVIE THERE ARE SOME PARTS ON THIS MOVIE THAT THEY DINT NEED TO PUT IN YOU WILL FIND OUT WHEN YOU WATCH IT IT STILL IS A GOOD MOVIE IINSEPT FOR SOME PARTS BUT THE PARTS ON THIS MOVIE IN DOT WHERE AS BAD AS THE FIRST FLIM IF THET DID NOT PUT THE SEXUEL PARTS ON THIS FILM IT WOYLD IT WOLD NOT BEA RATED PG13 BUT STILL IWOULD RECMEND THAT YOU SEE THIS AND THE FIRTS ONE THEY ARE BOTH GOOD MOVIES A VERY BRADY SEQEL IS RATED PG13
2,Not what I thought I was getting,It looks like the DVD I got is from Mexico. Most of the writing on the front is in Spanish.
3,"Clever ending, but don't let little children see it","This movie was okay. It was funny sometimes in spoofing the clean-cut, terribly unmodern Brady family, and it had a clever ending involving other characters from classic TV shows of that era. However, if you've divorced/widowed and married again,and your new husband has a young, impressionable child, and you have a young, impressionable child of the opposite sex from your first marriage, you shouldn't let them see this movie. They (the stepsiblings) might think it cool to move into the attic together, hang a sheet between them, and then coo, ""Are you thinking what I'm thinking?"" And they won't be talking about playing boardgames, mind you! Not a very pleasent thought, is it? This movie was rated PG-13 for a reason! I hope Greg and Marcia didn't fall hard for each other in the episodes of the series on which the movie is based and thus give young stepsiblings of the 70's this idea, too!"
3,"Oh My God, I'm Tripping With The Bradys","Pretty funny film, I must admit. One of the best scenes is on the plane to Hawaii when Greg (Johnny Bravo)Brady picks up his guitar & breaks out into a song. In another five seconds, the passengers would have handed him a parachute & shown him to the emergency exit.True, the critics trashed this film, but hey..this IS a Brady Bunch movie, not 'Citizen Kane.' It's not something you watch for social commentary."
5,"Great, cheesy, funny movie!","This is just a great, cheesy, and very funny movie! The director has taken all of the ""stand-out"" moments in the original series and uses them in the movie with big tongue-in-cheek finesse! Bravo! Even better than the series!"
5,A Riot,"This is probably one of my favorite comedies of all-time. Is it corny? Definitely. So it might take a certain kind of person to enjoy it. Like the first movie, the Bradys are living in the 90's yet them themselves seem to be trapped in the 70's unaware of how bizarre they seem. In this one, Carol's supposed first husband Roy suddenly shows up at the unsuspecting Brady's. Yet meanwhile, as in the first one, each family member is having their own private dramas. Greg and Marsha are attracted to each other, Jan is involved with an imaginary boyfriend, Cindy lost her doll, etc. Shelly Long is great as Carol and Alice does a great job too, but I think Jan steals the show. She's hillarious. So, if you like corny comedy, you can't go wrong with this."
5,Even Funnier Than The First Movie!,"I liked both movies but I thought A Very Brady Sequel was funnier and there wasn't a dull moment in it I especially liked the tripping with the Brady's scene, that was hysterical and Jennifer Elise Cox was even funnier as Jan in this movie. I highly recomend both movies to Brady Bunch fans but A Very Brady Sequel is the one I could watch again and again and not get bored with but The Brady Bunch movie is something I can only watch once n a while."
3,"Funny, Campy movie!","You'll like this film as much as the first Very Brady movie. The rivalry between Jan and Marsha is strong again, and especially funny. You'll be saying ""Marsha, Marsha, Marsha!"" for days afterwards."
4,SEQUAL Hits BRADY Note,"The first brought us into the time-warped world of The Brady's, who unlike any other has is still stuck in the decade of bell bottoms, lava lamps, and peace love and happiness. This time the Bradys are put into a fraud situation when Carol's first husband comes back from the dead. Carol is now torn between the love of her life, Mike, or the the man she dedicated her life to no matter what. If that weren't to make things worse, Greg and Marcia are lusting over each other and Jan is being just plain Jan. Now, I thought the first movie was histarical and that this one was just as good, with a few mistakes ... But we can always get passed those. The take on RuPaul's three same aged daughter's as the Brady's will give a good chuckle and the mistakes Mrs.Brady's first husband makes are quite fun,, all in all I would have to give this one a Big Brady! B"
4,Very good quality for the price,"I was pleasantly surprised when I received this watch. I suppose Accutron is the higher end line for Bulova. They are Swiss made, and feel substantial for their size and depth. It's a sophisticated piece that can certainly be worn with jeans, as well as a suit. Nice simple design overall, quite understated."
3,Great product,Great product. very compact for mobil dj. you can fold it up for very easy transport and storage. The only t thing didn't like from it is that its very short you put your turntabels on top and you hunched over the hole nite making it very hard to do you job
1,bologna,"this product is bullstuff, doesnt work, and it smells burnt like it had an electrical problem before. i cant imagine why because the product is suppose to be brand new..."
1,don't waste money,"It didn't work at all. I checked it through several ways, but it was in vain. Don't waste your money and time. There would be other ways."
5,their best cd that I've heard (I haven't heard ALL of them),"There have been a few rock bands to come out of the Atlanta area over the years like The Black Crows, R.E.M., and stuff like that, but Drivin' N' Cryin' are definitely Atlanta's best in my opinion. Their sound is a little bit of a mix between alternative and maybe country rock. They're well known in Georgia, but I'm not sure how known they are in the rest of the country, so pick up this cd and give them a try! More than likely, you won't be disappointed."
4,Great trim piece!,"I really do like this trim piece overall. It matches other MOEN shower trim kits perfectly. Just wish MOEN's oil rubbed bronze was a bit darker. The product is great, and deserves 4-5 stars, just personal preference on the color. I bought two and they both arrived perfectly protected for shipping and very fast. Would buy again."
1,Mac Software,Ordered Mac OS9 operating system to use Classic on my newer computer. Software would not load on the computer. Questioned the seller and was issued a refund.
4,As beautiful and rare a live recording as her live at the bbc is...,To like this album-an overview of her whole career-you have to get over the change in her voice at this point. This is still the same Marianne of the 60s. She went through a lot and it shows in her voice but every song is well sung with that voice. The music is outstanding and she sings with real feelings. Yes it would have been nice to hear her 60s soprano age naturally but that didn't happen. I like her voice because it shows that Marianne's problems were no myth and she is a true survivor. This is a beautiful keepsake.
4,"""Satisfaction""","I agree with the other reviewers that the sound quality of this CD is less than desirable but that is to be expected of many historical live recordings that were not professional recorded . Its value is that it captures a musical moment that has a looseness and spontaneity not always found when an artist plays with an awareness they are being recorded. The improvised version the Rolling Stones ""Satisfaction"" is a tip of a hat to Otis Redding's take on the song which reflects Guy and Well's closeness to the soul music of the period. The mixing of blues and soul was not well received by blues purists and could account for their lack of success among white blues aficionados much like the luke warm reception of Hendrix's flirtation with soul in the Band of Gypsys with Buddy Miles."
5,Purchased new from Amazon a 40-570 Scroll Saw,"Several weeks ago I purchased thru Amazon a brand new 40-570 Scroll Saw. It arrived in A-1 Condition and I have been totally thrilled with the purchase. I trust Amazon completely. And this saw is perfect for me....it was low-end price-wise, yet has all the features that are important to me....the ability to stop and reset for fretwork takes literally seconds instead of minutes. I would redo this purchase again in a hearbeat. In fact, I'm now looking for a bench-top table saw..... Thanks Amazon, for this rural user you are a Godsend!!!!"
3,Re: Intellectual Dishonesty,"Just some definitional clarification in response to comments made about the ""intellectual dishonesty"" of the authors:CAPITAL OFFENSE - a crime for which the death penalty may be imposed. Black's Law Dictionary, 7th Ed. 1999.Black's is the legal system's most trusted authority on legal terminology, and while it is perhaps unfair and potentially misleading for the authors to have exploited a reader's possible misunderstanding of the nature of capital sentencing and prosecutorial dealmaking, the authors are correct in their usage of the term."
3,"Great Music, Disappointing Voice","Cerveris is obviously a great musician and it shows on this cd. What was missing, though, is his great voice. I'm not suggesting he use his ""show tune"" voice to belt out these songs--it wouldn't be appropriate. But Cerveris goes so far out of his way to hide that booming voice that he sounds like he's whispering, and the effect is detrimental to the music. I find myself yelling at the stereo: ""Speak up! I can barely hear you!"" The music is inspired, soulful, even beautiful. Why not use that incredible voice to make it perfect?"
4,learn what to avoid,"Appropriately, the publication date is 1 April. The authors take a light hearted romp through IT. Dumping heavily on worse case practices. The book is a refreshing contrast to all those breezy, upbeat texts on IT guidelines and [successful] case studies. In reality, things can go badly awry, as you might know. And just in case you did not know, try scoping out this offering, to broaden your education.In a more serious vein, the book has a point. By studying worst practices, it can be as informative, if not more so, as a conventional approach. Learn what to avoid."
5,Intende for Humor but often sadly true,"The book offers a humorous, often negative and definitely sarcastic view of IT Service Support. Unfortunately it is an accurate representation of a lot of IT Service Providers and the attitude that those providing the Service have toward the user community.This would be a good eye opener for students to read before they start real ITIL training."
5,great book for beginners in pspice.,iam a graduate student in electrical engineering. i found the book very useful in my research work. i didn't have any basic knowledge about pspice before.this book has made me some sort of an expert in circuit simulation.very detailed and a great book for anyone who wants to be in the world of circuit simulation.
4,Organization,"I have used this in my pre-school classroom as an organizational chart. I have the students names on crayon shapes (they colored, and we laminated). Every morning the students can check to see what color table they are sitting at (colors are stuck to each table). I can ability group or just organize so that those who do not work well together are seperated. Love it for that!"
2,Software Testing and Continuous Quality Improvement 2nd Ed. Lewis,"Very poorly structured and poorly written book. It seems outdated considering it centers around the Waterfall development method.Unfortunately, this book was a requirement for my course, otherwise I would return it. It is by far the worst text book I have had to read in my studies.A note to prospective buyers: Keep in mind that (almost) all the positive reviews are over 6 years old and the negative reviews are recent. A lot seems to have happened in software development methodologies (including SQA) since that time!Hopefully, the forthcoming third edition is better but it requires a serious re-write."
2,Pretty but not worth it,"I ordered this case for the iPhone 5 in teal, and it's very pretty. I love the look of it, and it protected my phone but not as much I would've liked it too. I tried to take it off, and it is EXTREMELY hard to take off, and broke 2 of my REAL nails. I wouldn't complain if it protected my phone well, but it did not and it's stuck on my phone. Save the $9.15(shipping and handling) and just buy a better case.UPDATE: AFTER ONE HOUR, IT STILL ISN'T OFF, AND IT CUT ME SO NOW I'M BLEEDING."
4,Nice color and cheap,"Not used on iPhone yet, but the color and material are good as of now. i got blue color one for less price on deal."
2,The posted retail price posted is a joke - very cheap product,Misleading retail price very cheap product. It is worth may be a buck. If you want any level of protection for your iPhone 5 look else where.
2,pretty cheap plastic iphone case,"Oh, what a pretty, sparkly iphone case. It's too bad the quality is so poor. Yes, it is cheap in price, but still, it says it is a protective case. The thin brittle clear plastic sides do not offer any protection for the front of the phone. Maybe I have been spoiled though... coming from an Otterbox Reflex. Now that is a nice iphone case!"
2,Pretty piece of junk,"Ordered this for my white iPhone. While it is very pretty on the phone and looks great, there is NO PROTECTION. The case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever. In addition, after a few weeks, the back pebbles began to wear away to nothing leaving a hole of worn down white space in the back of my phone. Not cute."
3,so - so,I am returning this item - it was a gift for my daughter and she found another one she liked better. I don't think there are as many nice looking yet protecive cases for the iphone 4 like there were for the iphone 3. I thought this one looked kind of fun from the picture but I wasn't as impressed once we received the item.
3,nice case,"it was a nice case, but the color was different from the online picture. I thought it would be darker, but it's fine, pretty good case though."
4,"Nice-looking case, but very hard to take off!","The (iPhone5) case is plastic, as described - so I don't expect as much protection as a silicone case. Although, the mosaic pattern on the case is a shimmery gray/silver, but not in a flashy sort-of way, which is nice. The sides are clear and sit flush with the edges, thus giving it a sleek, slim look. The only downside is that it can become quite difficult to change cases/remove the case off for cleaning, etc. because of how snugly it fits the phone."
2,"Preety case, too small","This is a pretty case. That being said, it is to small for the iPhone 4s. Thecase is shorter than the width of the phone. should have returned it."
5,Ghosts hit!,"Ghosts is the excellent followup to Days Go By, but has been unceremoniously been underrated due to the big first single. Not that Days Go By wasn't good but Ghosts is even better. A heady mixture of cool electronic dance with a less autotuned vocal that spells of yearning that ""all I ever wanted was to feel the way you feel.""Check out the two remixes here especially the joeski vocal. They rock the house down. Also contains the video. Dirty Vegas' beut album might not have been terrific throughout but they show great promise, hopefully to be unleashed on their next new record."
1,Terrible,Avoid this CD as much as possibleNo talent here.This fellow has no idea what music is.Baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad!
1,Cheezy music,The guy on the first review is soooooooooo right!!! He's nothing but an overpriced karoake singer. His music all sounds the same. Get a band dude and start playing some REAL music. Don't forget that there are...(people) listening to you.
3,Value product,I bought these for 30 employees. Its a value mug. Good but lid is a bit difficult to put back on but you get what you paid for.
5,Travel Mug,I'm very pleased with travel mugs I purchased. They're a good looking quality made mug. The price was also a good deal.
4,Great Mugs,"We have been very pleased with these mugs. They are good for the price, and hold the temperature pretty well. Great deal for the price."
5,"My FAVORITE Ralph's World CD, and that's saying alot!","If you only buy one Ralph's World CD, this is it. While I find most of Ralph's CDs brilliant but uneven, this one has so many rollicking wonderful tunes, there's not a bad one in the bunch. My kids cannot get enough of the title song, ""Covered in Glue"", ""Go go Pogo"", ""Puppy Dog""...there are some fantastic songs here! Buy it! You won't be sorry."
2,Pass it by.,"I found this housing useful for shooting photos and video at the beach. However the latch seems weak and has already broken once on me, and since damage isn't covered under warranty you'll be out some cash.The Main Problems:You can't turn off and on the LCD without opening the unit which runs down the battery.The lens fogs up after about 45 minutes of use in and out of water."
4,What a topic about endless time.,I first read this book when I was ten. It was part of my fathers library. I just had to get it and read it again!
4,Awkward but very rewarding,"The author seems to have had a lot of trouble deciding what type of book he wanted to write. Hot Sleep begins as a fairly typical future-urban coming-of-age tale of a telepath. It soon degenerates into a B-grade thriller, then jets off into space and ultimately becomes a future history. Despite this, it ultimately comes together to form a very impressive first novel, with the truly epic scope that only science fiction has ever been able to do well, and a beautifully haunting ending. While it's a pity about some of the early parts, the book has a wonderful unity of vision, and it reminded me, as so few books I have read recently, why I love reading sf."
5,Ultimate party survival kit,This is one of the best investments I've made. We used this at my son's wedding reception. It was so fun. Thanks for having this product.
3,static,"I like the smell of this conditioner, though it can be over whelming if you use it on a daily basis. I have also noticed that every time I use this conditioner, my hair has a lot of static."
2,Did not put hair in hydrating condition :(,"I used this conditioner as part of a 5-step ""ritual"". It made my medium-textured relaxed hair a puffy disaster. I expect a conditioner to make my hair feel soft and a wide-tooth comb should glide through with the product in and after it is rinsed out.The only reason that I didn't give it one star is because it did at least undo the matted bird's nest that the ojon ""hydrating"" shampoo left my hair in but I had to work way too hard to comb through my hair.My hair felt extremely dry after using the set and I would never recommend this product line at all and will be returning."
4,Great for busy families!,"I found this to be a great addition to my OT lending library. Since the video is divided into segments (one for each sensory system addressed), it makes it easy for busy parents to watch (and process/absorb) in small increments. Britt Collins speaks clearly, slowly, and in terms that can be grasped by parents."
3,Misunderstood,"I had been searching for this product for years, so I thought I'd finally found it. Low and behold it was a cassette and not a cd, that wasn't very clear when I purchased it. So needless to say I lost about $2+ called a restocking fee. Wasn't very happy about that."
3,Great Concept But Lacks Professional Quality,"Bottom Line: Good for occasional use or shade tree mechanic.PRO: Great idea, affordable price, integral holderCON: Not professional quality - rachet gears wear out or stick after awhile, especially during/after hard usePurchased a set of these a few years ago and use them quite a bit. I love the concept and design, which keeps the user from having to flip the wrench or remove to reposition in tight areas. Open and closed ends of the wrenches fit nuts and bolt heads correctly - not too tight, not sloppy. Although I like these and got them at a great price, I'd caution professionals and heavy users from purchasing because the quality just isn't there. As anyone that makes a living with their tools will agree - it's best to purchase tools from the name brand toolmakers that offer lifetime guarantees and will replace a broken item on the spot."
2,False advertisement photo!,"The device was easy to install and the instructions were fairly clear. We purchased this item primarily for its large display numbers. However, the visibility of the numbers is extremely poor and no where near that shown in the item photo. The screen is ""backlit"" by a light on one side which energizes during a call or upon button pressing. The light increases number legibility somewhat but it is still rather poor. I will return this item and look for a product with better number visibility."
2,Shoulda been a MySpace page,"I guess when you're 59, like me, you shouldn't be buying books written by people under 25. Around the Bloc is sort of the tale of somebody's junior year abroad. Unfortunately, it takes more than a year to learn anything valid about somebody else's culture. So here's a woman who's reaped the affirmative action benefits of being Mexican in gringo America, and when a Cuban asks her what country she's from, she says ""Canada."" That's when I tossed the book into the box for the used book store. This woman needs to go live in the third world someplace for 15 years, without the benefit of a paycheck from the US. Then she can write a book."
1,Nubidu's Anime review,This movie blows. 2 episodes only - which will leave you uncertain about where this is going and where it all began.
5,excellent !!,"It was a fascinating and thrilling experience to read this book. Wallace certainly had great insights and a wealth of knowledge. My impression after reading this book is that Nobel prize winners are not saints not super human beings but just like you and me with hopes fears and human problems but somehow, by luck, their achievements had turned out to be unique and acclaimed."
4,A hardspun ball of facts and fiction that may knock you down,"On the cover IW tells us that the book has taken over 15 years and at least one trip to sweden to accomplish. You just simply have to admire the ambition to tell us such a complete story. In this ambition he takes on the herritage of older storytelling (and also educating) authors. The plot is simple; we follow the nobelwinners of one year from the time they are chosen too the time they leave Stockholm with their checks. In the time inbetwen we get an indepth analysis of the minds and psychological functions of people who are alcoholics, suffer from low self esteem and so om. Also in his pick of personalities IW demonstrates that the goal is to educate the readers, this time moraly. the book is well woth reading both for its facts on the nobel prize, the gossip around the nobel prize and its analysis of different aspects of the meaning of life and how to do it."
2,Less Than satisfied,"I have used this brush head for years. I always purchased them from my dentist. I ordered the flat brush once before and thought one of them was defective. I attributed it to bad luck and decided to try again. Same thing happened! The brush does not spin correctly and stops with even the slightest amount of pressure. As an experienced Rotadent user, I know this brush should perform differently. I will continue to purchase from my dentist in the future."
5,Great Product,These brush heads for the Rotadent Toothbrush are excellent. They are the ones my hygeniest recommends -- they were shipped promptly and received when promised. I would order these again!!
3,Wrong Type Heads,Well I ordered these not realizing that there are two different types of tips that go on the Rotadent. My Ratadent has a round base. These tips have a square base - so I am not too happy! Otherwise they look great!
5,GREAT,I have used many toothbrushes in my lifetime. including water picks etc. nothing has worked as well as this product. I plan to stay with it.
5,dental tips with Rota-dent products,"i purchased the complete Rota-dent toothbrush with extra brushes from my old dentist. i have sinced moved and could not find the replacement brushes anywhere. thanks to amazon, i was able to purchase replacement brushes at an excellent price. i have to admit, my teeth have never been better and my hygienist raves about how clean my teeth and gums are. she barely had to scrape away any plaque or tartar at my last cleaning last week. i will continue to buy my replacement products through amazon and in doing so keep my teeth and gums their healthiest. amazon has always come through for me."
1,Design is flawed,"This head doesn't fit the handheld part well. In fact, I watched it come off on its own while it was turned on. This has happened to several of the same type in a row, yet the device works with the pointed brushes."
5,Rotadent Head,As described and received on time. No shipping charge or sales tax. Would order again from this provider.
3,Does not stick well to my car doors,"I am sure that if all you wanted to do was print medium quality pictures to put them on your refrigerator these sheet could work well. However, I tried to use them for number panels on the doors of my car. The magnetic material is too thin to adhere well and the corners soon curled and lift and or fell off. Also the seem temperature sensitive in that when it was cold outside they didn't seem to stick at all. The semi-glossy surface is a bit more rough than I would like for photo quality printing."
5,One of the best biochemistry book,"I have not seen the 2000 edition yet, but the previous edition is very elegantly written. Compare with some other biochemistry text, this book provides another view into biochemistry. Almost (if not all) all the chapters have a special topic after the chapter text, showing you how we can turn the dry text into useful experimental tools for solving life's problem, scientifically. These special topics also give us a view into the physical chemistry world, which has become more and more important at the time."
5,Wonderful Biochemistry book for beginners,"I Am a high school student that plains on becoming a Anesthesiologist. I wanted a book that was easy to under stand and read without need of previous knowledge of chemistry or biochemistry. This book is wonderful!, I have not read the whole 1500 pages, but the 200 that I have read I fully under stand. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn biochemistry, AND IT INEXPENSIVE! Trust me you will not regret you purchase."
2,"Timeslips: 2, Terrors: 0","A few interesting ideas, but none really pan out. Only a couple of stories were timeslips. One was way too protracted and the other cliché.A fair number of the stories seem like Lifetime TV movies in which abusive, crude husbands are endured by put-upon women. Maybe there's a vampire stripper thrown in the mix, but it really doesn't help.A seeming complete lack of editing also undermines the author's talent, which has promise, but needs a firm hand to cut away the excess and guide the plot to a satisfying ending."
4,Another Serial game,"Yet another game that requires you pretty much do everything in serial order to get through it. Not sure anyone ever actually makes it through these things without some reference to cheats as there is almost never two or more ways to solve anything. How come they build really good games for play station and Nintendo that are so much more complex. Decisions have consequences and they are numerous ways to solve problems.At least it has an interesting story line, so is fun to play through."
4,New style for the series,"It's kind of hard getting used to, it's in 3D, and since Broken Sword 1 and 2 are produced with the classic cartoon-like drawings. But there's continuation from the previous games, plus the voice acting is fairly good. You can play with keyboard or mouse, or a combination of both. There is also a Broken Sword 2.5 that's free to download from the web, I wish I played 2.5 before going to 3, 2.5 is in the cartoon style."
5,LOVE IT!!,"I played this game a couple years ago and have been searching ever since for a game to match the quality and enjoyment this one brought me. I loved that instead of the usual point-and-click, the player uses the keyboard to move the character around, including sneaking, hiding, climbing, and interacting with objects. It felt like I was really a part of the story. And there was real action/combat! I could even die! I remember in the old days, one had to remember to save their game all the time or you would die unexpectedly and have to replay from your last save point. This is a flash-back to those days.Overall, this game was great! I highly recommend to new or seasoned adventure game fans!"
3,"Annoying, with a few nuggets","I found the whole evolutionary psychology bit to be annoying - I simply don't buy that I want to cheat on my husband because I'm trying to ""trade up"" in the gene pool. If that's the case, why am I looking for less attractive partners so that I don't get too involved? I just wanted the rules, not some hair-brained discourse on why monkeys cheat. On the other hand, the rules are very good (and if that's all you want, just start on pg. 121), and they helped me to realize that it would require much trouble and deceit to run around on a guy that I love to death. I'm not going to feel bad about the occasional conference fling, but I'm not going to put any energy into a long time affair. Maybe that was the whole point of the book."
1,Wow. How low can you go,"I have a real problem with the ""how-to"" aspect of this book. It's a training manual for theives, only the things stolen and destroyed here are far more precious than money. I wonder if that's why the author stays as far away from the wronged spouse as possible. Is it because she doesn't want to be reminded of her victim?"
1,"Excuses, Excuses","Let me first say that I listen to Howard Stern and enjoy him most of the time. BUT......This book is written for those of you who do not value integrity which is obviously in very short supply these days. It is no wonder this woman is from New York; the capitol of all things materialistic and narcissistic.Financially speaking it is easier to cheat than to separate and/or divorce? Sure, until your spouse finds out, and they eventually find out. How will things look to a judge then? Oh right, just don't get caught and it's ok. Because we all know the bad part is getting caught, not the actual deed.I am sure the bosses at Enron and other companies we see in the papers thought the same way about stealing millions of dollars. As long as nobody knows, it's ok!You will know and you will have to live with yourself for the rest of your life."
4,I actually learned something new.,"I have been going through some tough times with my marriage and a friend kind of shocked me by giving me this book, not so much because of the adultery aspect, but because she said that there was good information about why we marry in the first place and why we pick whom we pick- and then get tired of them. I had never actually thought about any of this in terms of anything really beyond the romantic myths we are handed as kids. The information here really opened my eyes, being as there are many scientific reasons for getting married and, it appears for wanting to get out."
3,Multiple messages...,"There are multiple messages in this very readable ""Cliff's Notes"" on adultery. Reading superficially, one learns the highlights of the practice. Reading between the lines, a subliminal message emerges: ""What the hell are you thinking?!"" It's disappointing that the book doesn't explore an additional option: honesty. In fact, it specifies the opposite, encourging ""compartmentalizing"" an affair. Assuming that someone contemplating adultery has the foresight to read this book before entering into an affair, they might be well-advised to first approach their spouse and respectfully share their thoughts. At the very least this will spark a lively discussion, and might even lead to a better solution -- for both! BTW, don't believe the author's contention that ""romantic feelings"" cannot be re-kindled in a committed relationship. It just takes work. See marriagebuilders.com website for details."
4,Looking forward to using this.,"While it's not my idea of ""large""--I expected it to be twice the size that it is--I think it will be a good thing, as my daughter will be able to fill up the bank, and achieve her financial goals more quickly than with one of those ""bottemless pit"" piggy banks."
1,CHEAP PLASTIC Interesting Idea Weak Execution,"I looked for a long time for an educational piggy bank and thought I had found a tool to teach my six year old about money. Unfortunately when it came time to take the money to the bank I had to help him get the bills out with tweezers and tape the torn ones. Also had a very hard time explaining the difference between invest and save, just not a concept a 6 year old can grasp.The real shame is it made form two pieces of plastic glued together. I bought two of these and both broke apart. Frankly for the $20 I paid for this the free one I got from my credit union works just fine. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
1,Very Fragile,"I bought these for my two young boys as their first piggy bank. Primarily I liked that they were plastic (thinking they would be unbreakable) but when my 38-inch tall son dropped the empty bank while he was standing (meaning the bank fell about 18 inches to the ground)it broke in several different places. This was on day one, the very first time it fell. Very dissapointed...."
4,Great idea!,We ordered 2 of these. The girls were very excited to save for different things. On the first day one broke right down the middle seam(lengthwise). I contacted the company and they sent one out that day at no charge to replace the broken one. Very good customer service. These are definitely not to play with but do serve the purpose of saving. I need to get one for my husband!!
5,The winderful piggy,"I bought this for my grandson's 6th birthday. He has a reputation for breaking toys in short order. He loved the bank, was very interested in the 4 compartments and, of course, how to get the money out. He hasn't broken this yet and it has increased his interest in saving. I'm glad I went low tech on this toy."
4,very enjoyable but....,"I found this DVD very enjoyable but not as thorough as I had expected. I thought the newsreels were very good but I wish they had included more rare footage, like screen tests, wardrobe tests, commercials and other footage that turn up on numerous documentaries. The collection of movie trailers were great but again some were missing (There's No Buisness Like Show Buisness), and some were of really bad quality (Bus Stop). The audio part of her studio recordings were excellent and thorough, with the best fidelity I've heard so far on CD, unfortunatly I was unable to play it on my CD player as I had hoped. All and all, worthwhile but not as ""complete"" as they say."
3,OVERALL....DISSAPOINTING,"I would not have purchased this DVD had i know what was on it. The best part are the Newsreels but here is a lot of familiar footage also. There are only a few, often seen pictures and movie posters,a large selection of Marilyn's songs from her movies (mostly) and a lot of movie trailers. Standard stuff."
2,Not good enough,"There are not many interviews with Marilyn Monroe which is what I would have liked to see, mostly trailers about her movies and not a thought out and in depth documentary because it is not based on any book out there about her, just clips here and there and so very disappointing."
1,Another failed emissions test,Second set of magnaflow cats that we've installed and the vehicle has failed emissions. They look good installed but are a waste of money. I now have 4 magnaflow cats sitting that are not useable in Colorado.
4,Back in the Hardsuits!,"well I am a major fan of BGC and it's really cool RPG. I like some of the new features in this show. But you gotta dig the 80's animation. One thing, What's up with Leon and Daley? They were one of the best parts in the orginal OAV. And with the hardsuits haveing limited battery time (which I like and will adopt into my BGC rpg campaigns) and the launching of the suits like Evangelions is cool, b/c Evangelion is cool. To new viewers, go and see the first OAV (and maybe Crash and AD Police)."
4,A worthy video,"A great introduction tape that sets the stage for things to come. The animation is top quality and has a very nice feel to it. This tape is a must even for those who don't wish to see the whole story because it gives a good look at the changes between this version and the old BGC. Though the tape is not that fulfilling in and of its self, because so much is still unsaid, it is a perfect launch to the rest of the tapes."
5,Awesome black cartridge,The dataproduct black compatible cartridge for the Epson Stylus Color 760 is awesome. The ink is just as good as Epson's at a fraction of the cost. I bought one after I went through the cartridge that came with the printer and had no problems. I have owned the printer for a year and went to refilling after 6 months but for the first five months I used these cartridges and can say they are well worth the money. I still use these cartridges when refilling. A good investment and saves lots of money over the expensively priced epsons. They don't cause clogging like other cheap compatible cartridges and the black produced from them is just as good as the epson's if not better.
3,Field Goal!,I bought this because I bought a Wilson football on the first anniversary of 9/11 in 2002 the day that Johnny Unitas died and I found out by later watching a Yankees game on ESPN. I am the grandson of a Jewish European Immigrant and I thought the football kickers were always soccer players.
4,Excellent reissue of rare recordings,"The only reason I give this album four stars instead of five is because of the performances themselves. The packaging and the reissue itself by Arbiter records is without fault. And while it is delightful and interesting to hear Francis Planté play works by Chopin, he was as old as the hills when these recordings were made, and his technique was not quite up to the challenge. Do not expect him to be any rival to Michaelangeli or Blechacz. However, it is of unparalleled historical import that we at least have recordings made available to us by this artist who was active almost 150 years ago."
2,Strange Paper,"This is the strangest paper I have ever used.Yes, it is glossy. No, it is NOT photo paper. In fact, using photo settings for your printout will make the output very muted/pastel. It actually works better in BrightWhite settings. Having said that, normal Bright White paper has better output and more vivid color.Although the package says 32#, it is thinner than my 24# bright white and feels thinner than 20#. It over-saturates with ink very easily and dimples. It also usually curls up when it comes out of the printer from the ink moisture. I've never had ANY paper ever do that.If you like to experiment with weird stuff you will really like this paper. If you are thinking, ""WOW! What cheap photo paper!"", you are going to be very disappointed."
1,The paper is good but buy.com service rediculously bad,"I ordered this pack of premium recycled paper - and one pays a premium for this. It arrived in a sorry state. The paper packaging was completely torn, exposing the paper within, with some of the sheets soiled. I returned it.The replacement came today. Battered box, torn packaging inside, curled up exposed dirty edges of the product. It must have been packed already torn - the damage was not consistent with transit.Needless to say I am returning it again."
3,The book is great but this edition was too old,"This is an out-of-print book and hard to come by. I'm sensitive to musty smells so didn't get to read it. Hopefully, someone will once the library in my town puts it up for sale."
1,disapointed,I ordered the 32 oz and received an 8 oz. When I tried to call I could not get an answer and no one would return my call. These people are thieves. CND Scrubfresh Nail Prep 32 oz.
5,The anchor still holds..,This album is so inspiring.. it ministers to the heart. Ray is not a perfect person and has made mistakes.. but each and everyone of us is in that same boat. This music will touch the heart.
5,"Every song tells a wonderful story, great anointing.","If this album does'nt touch you, you might want to check your pulse and see if your still alive."
1,TERRIBLE,"The show Neon Genesis Evangelion is an OK show at best, I would rate a good episode at a 6-7 at best, but contains multiple episodes that recycle animation for 25 minutes with a cop out bull excuse of the character analyzing their own mind. The last two episodes are litterally an insult to the viewer, a metaphorical slap to the face and a middle finger to boot, the end is completely made up of hand drawn slides, digitizes pictures, text slides, recycled animation and voice acting to tie it together, it seems the company in charge of animation lost their budget near the end and had to change whatever end they intended for a completely boring anti-climactic ending that makes you feel like youve wasted your life.Don't waste your money or time on this series, try Yu Yu Hakusho, Rouroni Kenshin, Great Teacher Onizuka, Full Metal (insert word here because all shows starting with that are good), but if you watch this series til the end you will regret it."
4,Three episodes?!?!,"This would be a 5 but.... There are only 3 episodes on this DVD. AD Vision is milking anime fans, Again. There is no reason to put only 3 instead of 4 eposisodes on this. It is not like they included lots of extra features! I Have this entire series on (fansub) but I am tring to support Ginex and U.S. distibuters of anime. It is not like it is hard to get in Tokyo. Bottom line is__ If you want to watch a very good series. You are going to get tail piped by AD Vision."
3,Disappointed J-Pop fan,"If you ask any of my friends, I am a complete J-pop fan. So, because of this I bought JAPAN FOR SALE. It was a complete disappointment. Some of the songs are just background music and a lot of the ones in Japanese just repeat a few words. For example, Yunegiwa Last Boy by Supercar. If you are really interested in J-pop try listening to V6 or if you are into J-Rock try Gackt, you won't be disappointed!!!"
3,Can't get them to stay in place,"These are much better than my stock, carpet floor mats. They hold a lot of water and debris that's tracked into the car so for that they're perfect. I would rate these higher but I can't get them to stay where they're supposed to be, the front ones have a hook to connect them to the floor but these just have little bumps that protrude from the rubber on the bottom."
3,"Pretty, but not durable.","I bought these because I wanted a durable set of mats for my BMW, to preserve the cloth mats. Well, They have already worn out. I can't BMW has stooped this low in quality. I expected German sturdiness."
3,Great fit and material - Poor color match,"The materials and fit are BMW caliber. But, the color match in reality against what is posted on the product page is way off. From the pictures on the webpage you are thinking beige/tan.... product is actually more of a medium brown and a far cry from anything beige. Not wanting to deal with the hassle of returning the item, I will just deal with the color. Other than that, good product."
2,Marginal at best,"The way people wax about this CD in their reviews you would think Blue 6 invented the turntable. Every track sounds the same, which is to say ""not that interesting."" Whatever happened to melodies? Every track, I kept waiting and waiting for the actual groove to kick in. Instead, the prelude/background ambiance just kept coming. By the end of this soporific CD, I was bored stiff."
5,Getting my HOUSE fix!!!,I am a transplanted New Yorker in Atlanta who missed TRUE house from my old club days. This cd is definitely quenching my thirst for DeEp HoUsE!!! I can't wait to see what the other cd's sound like!!!
4,This is a must buy...,"When i first ordered this album i wasnt too sure what to think. i had just gotten started listening to this kind of music and didnt know too much about it. However, when i heard it, it just put me in this mood... i cant really describe. This is such a good cd, very chill and laid back. Everytime i play it for people they always want to know who sings this, or who sings that. I highly recommend purchasing this cd and having it for your collection. This is one of those cd's that you can put on when your going for a drive, or when youve got that sexy female that you want to impress."
4,Good house music,"I am not a huge fan of dance/house music, but this album is nicely done and has a sexy feel to it. It took me a little play time to get use to it, but worth a listen. If you are more into down-tempo/lounge, I would check out Thievery Corporation, Kruder and Dorfmeister and dZihan and Kamien before this one though."
3,"It was good, but I Was Expecting Better","Again, I am another reviewer puzzled as to why this CD was receiving so many rave reviews. Based on a review by C. Runyon, who appears to be well informed about the music he listens to I purchased the CD, but it was not excactly what I had expected to hear. I like the ""chill vibe"" and ""downtempo"" but the vocals are bland almost boring. I was hoping for something similar to Jamie Myerson's ""The Listen Project"", track no. 3. ""Everything is Gonna Be Alright"" or track no. 6. ""Rescue Me"" or even Roni Size's ""New Forms"", track no. 8. ""Heros"", track no. 9. ""Share the Fall"" and track no. 10. ""Watching Windows"". Now those are vocals! I guess I'll keep looking."
4,good one,"Not a waste of money...some very nice songs, maybe too slow.You can listen it over and over and it's not boring"
5,The first House LP I love from beginning to end !,"I always found House LPs were weak and very inconsistent,especially all that French sound, and that EPs were best for that kind of music.This LP must be the exception, it got many good songs, it's very soulful, with great vocalist and real instruments.A must have !"
5,Chill Music with house beats,"Ever since I bought this CD, I have not removed it from CD player carousel. The songs have a house groove that you can dance to or listen when chilling out on the couch. The lyrics are surprisingly insightful for the house genre. I liked the record so much, that I bought Nude Dimensions Vol 1 tru 3, since Blue Six cuts are featured on some of the the Nude Dimension collection CDs."
2,not impressed,"i bought this CD based on the other amazon reviews posted here; let me just say that it's the only time in probably eight purchases that the reviews let me down. i expected it to be electronic, a bit trancy and coolly mellow to listen to. it is mellow, but in an 80s kind of way. the music is pretty boring and predictable and the lyrics are just kind of trite and uninspired. i really don't like the main vocalist's voice either. as far as my comparison to 80s sound goes, i'm not sure why, but i kept expecting to hear stevie wonder sing accompaniment or something.just for a base of comparison, i absolutely love zero7 ""simple things"", massive attack (especially ""mezzanine""), portishead, radiohead, everything but the girl and theivery corporation. i bought this at the same time as ""richest man in babylon"" and that was by far the CD i preferred. two stars. i'll probably sell it to a used CD shop."
2,All a bit boring by the fourth track,"Bought this based on the very positive feedback and my love of ""chillout"" music. Chill has moved a long way from its roots if this is what passes for that category nowadays.My experience was; track 1- Ok, track 2 - er, ok, track 3 - haven't I just heard this?, track 4 - zzzzzzzz. Anyway, you get the point."
3,Overrated,"I found this CD to be a real let-down considering the hype it's received. It's smooth and mellow, but rather understated. Too understated, actually. And some of the lyrics are very simplistic (""Let's Do It Together"" and ""Very Good Friends"" in particular). I liked Love Yourself and Sweeter Love (which is why I bought the CD) but really I think I like the remixes of Blue Six better than the original."
2,really disappointed,"There are some great tracks on here - but if you follow Naked Music, you probably already have them. The new songs are all filler/unfinished."
2,Very Average,"After reading all the other rave reviews and the comparisons with Nuspirit Helsinki and Thievery Corporation I thought this cd had to be worthwhile buying but it's turned out to be very average. Just when you think it might get interesting with new sounds or instruments coming in, it just seems to go nowhere,for eg., keyboards & flute etc just get stuck in (boring) loops. Fair enough, if you're just into background music and not aiming to stimulate your mind too much then this cd may be ok for you."
2,ALL TRAX SOUND TOO SIMILAR...NOT ENOUGH VARIATION!,"WELL.....There is just too much of the same approach for each song to hold my interest.While all the songs are put together well, they all use the same sounds, drum patterns, etc.The BASS sound (sine wave) Jay uses is the exact same sound for all the songs...quite frankly, this bass sound lacks character, and should be used only sparingly.All the tempos and drum patterns are virtually the same as well, leaving one scratching their head---""why do all these songs sound so similar""Jay is a talented writer/producer, but needs to change up his sounds a bit, and try to use different drum patterns, other than the standard 4/4 house beat.The best LP Naked has released has got to be AQUANOTE'S ""The Pearl""--much more interesting and varied.ReenoSPAZZOID ENTERTAINMENTWWW.SPAZZOID.COM"
5,Great Chill Album!!!!,"Had never heard of this Artist, Until Amazon sent me an email of items I might like. Im glad I took the time to check it out because it turned out to be an incredible album, and im looking forward to checking out some more of this Artist's work. Its some Great Chill music, you wont be disappointed!!!!"
2,Not so beautiful Tomorrow,"This album is way too drum machine and synthetic sounding. Very dissappointing and missing a major element that most naked music artists bring to this label.I've heard a few remixed blue 6 tracks that sound amazing, but the artists that mixed them added the element that ""Beautiful Tomorrow"" does NOT possess.I feel only dissapointment 95% of the time while listening to thisalbum."
1,disappointed with my purchase,"I purchased this CD based on the rave reviews found here and while I was initially drawn to the first cut, I have since decided that it is very bland and predictable. I will be selling this CD the first chance I get. I would listen before you buy!"
1,Boring Boring Boring,"Unless you dig sitting in a dark cafe swirling your cosmo waiting for some fool to notice you, or unless you run a gallery of pathetically emotional and jouvenile art, you will hate this album. It is everything the stereotype was created for."
4,live traffic at it's best!,"as we who provide comments here should all know, what we appreciate is subjective. having said that, and having had the chance to see the original and a subsequent incarnation of traffic, blind man and feelin' good are as good as traffic ever was. this is stevie winwood's soul at it's best. if you don't dig this, fuhgeddabout it! four stars because some of the studio stuff is so so."
3,Nothing wrong with traffic,"This album is pretty good. It's not expensive and it's got one of my favorite traffic songs ever on it, medicated goo. While my record was delivered to me in much worse condition than advertised I still enjoy it."
4,Last Exit review,"This is the one item from the Traffic collection that I never had. And since I have most of the other Traffic works (from Mr. Fantasy all the way to When The Eagle Flies), I decided to add it to the collection. I had heard it before back in my college days, but had forgotten how good it was. Typical Traffic sound while Dave Mason was with the band, but you can hear the beginnings of what was to come with John Barleycorn. Not too many tracks, but what is offered is top quality. And now my Traffic collection is complete."
3,more work then I thought,"I was given this item as a gift, it is nice and enexpensive. The only problem is it takes anywhere from 5minutes and up to get a result. Then again, you can do 800 tests, so for the money it's a great item. But it just takes too much time for me"
5,Fresh Water Master Kit,Haven't used it yet but it came on time and it looks pretty good with directions.
3,API was recommended amongst most brands,"PH test kit works. Nitrite test works. Ammonia test works. Nitrate test kit fails. Nitrate results always yield 0 PPM, which couldn't be right since I dose Nitrate in my planted aquarium every other day. Also, confirmed this when I brought my water sample to my LFS and my nitrate was 20~30 PPM as I expected using EI dosing schedule."
5,"Great product, especially when cycling a tank","This is very helpful and a must for everyone who owns a fish tank.There is already hundreds of positive review about this test kit, and it really works!When cycling a tank, keep track of your ammonia level, when it hits 0ppm, keep track of your nitrite level, when it hits 0ppm, your tank is cycled.Highly recommended!"
5,Good product to have if you have an aquarium.,"Good product to test your aquarium water. Bought this at Amazon, it's a lot cheaper than at Petco or Petsmart for similar products. It comes with a lot tubes and you feel like a chemist at work, testing pH and all the other parameters. My kids love it too."
5,It has met my likeing,"simple to use quick to use ,cost was to my reach just right for what i want to do ,good"
5,Easy of use,"Excellent product and very easy to use. A ""must have"". Arrived on time as expected. Enough water testing chemicals for at least 1 year of use for an excellent price."
1,coated in oil?,"I just got my API test kit in the mail. Not sure why but the inside clear box is soaked in an oily substance. I opened it and the test tubes, books, and chemical bottles are all also covered in this oil. Hmmedit: The nitrate #2 bottle had a cracked dropper cap... allowing the chemicals to spill everywhere. And amazon doesn't take returns on this item???"
4,"There isn't a GH or KH test, and the test strip has a Nitrate error","It works great as a product. Gives nice easy readings and is recommended by most fish hobbyists.The issue I have is the description lists two tests not included in this kit. Gh and Kh didnt come with mine. Also, newer kits have an issue with the 10 ppm and 20 ppm Nitrates on the color card being the same. Its not a huge deal, since Nitrates are usually ok under 40 ppm, but kind of annoying."
1,Description is false,"I ordered the test kit on jan 21st and it took tell feb 1st to get which seemed long but maybe i am just spoiled with prime. I did not take any stars off for the shipping time.My main issue is the description is false. It clearly says:""Freshwater Master Test Kit is a complete kit for testing tap water & aquarium water.Tests water 6 different ways to protect tropical fish from dangerous water conditions.Tests include: freshwater pH, ammonia, nitrite, high range pH, GH & KH, 4 test tubes, tray.""Well where is the GH & KH kit? It seems that the description is wrong. It says the kits are included but they are not. The ONLY reason i bought this was because it had the GH and KH kit included and i found it silly to spend the money on just a GH and KH kit when i could just get the other items for a only a little bit more.Needless to say i am frustrated. I waited 12 days to get the wrong thing.I guess i should have read the text on the picture and not the actual product description./rant"
1,um...,"the product description says it includes a gh & kh test. This is not true. I bought this mostly because of those tests, and was very disappointed when they did not come with the test kit."
5,Very Helpful,I bought this product after receiving advice from [...] When I tested for the first time everything came back perfect. I then decided to add more fish to my tank and after a couple of days I had a huge Ammonia spike. This test kit saved all of my fishes lives because I was able to do a water change right away (after finding out that I had Ammonia in the tank.)I also was having a problem with too much Ammonia in my tank even after a water change. I decided to test my tap water and I found out that I had 1ppm of ammonia coming from my tap. That is a crazy amount.Buy this product and you will not be disappointed. The only negative I have about it is that the Nitrate test takes a while. It is a lot of shaking the bottle of test solution 2 and the test tube. It is still pretty easy and you can have all of the test preformed in a few minutes.
5,Wannabe Mad Scientist with a fish tank?,"Then this is the kit for you! Kit includes everything you need to make brightly colored fluids out of your fish tanks' normally clear-ish water. Made me go ""mwah ha ha ha haaa"" the first time. Quality kit, the test tubes are great and having 4 allows for simultaneous testing of the key parameters. Extremely helpful as I did a fish-in cycle and needed to monitor closely to make sure no one died. ;) Thanks to the kit, all 3 fish survived the cycle, and we are now a mature tank!"
3,Good for the price,Very accurate. Definitely good to have when cycling your tanks or checking to see if you need a water change. The only thing I wish it came with was the Gh and Kh tests.
5,Great Buy!,This set of tests is a great buy. The kit is easy to use with results that are easy to understand.
5,Fun and Plentiful,"Plenty of chemical to test many times! I love how useful and fun this kit is!After testing many times, you get to the point of being able to tell by looking at your water that there is something wrong. Having this kit tells you what it is!! :)"
4,"Great test kit, essential if you have aquariums, easy directions.","This kit is wonderful and very accurate. It also saves a lot of money than doing the strip tests and gives you more accurate measurements. I've found it very easy to use, fast to use, and it's helped me keep my aquariums in top condition. The only negative I can see is that it should have included one more vial since you do end up doing all the tests on the aquarium and that way you can have them all at once. It would also be nice to be able to purchase replacement vials since they do break (glass). Otherwise the cards are great for comparing colors, the booklet goes into detail that will help a new aquarium lover to keep their system in top form."
3,Cheap solution for long term analysis,"I really enjoy this product. The convinience to do the analysis almost every day at a negligeble cost. My water has a very veird pH so I have the tendency to keep it monitored almost every day, I don't have nitrogen problems, so I don't care much obut those one.Like the strips it is a colorimetric methods, and sometimes you have an indication of what is your status. I work in a lab, and I have access to a bench pH meter, so every once in a while I test the pH in the lab, and with my surprice this test is much more accurate than the strip one. I use to use the API strips and the pH always resulted higher than the one I measure in the lab, however, whith this colorimetric it can get pretty close.The price of this is good, about 10$ in savings compare to the pet store."
4,Great Testing Kit,"Started a shrimp tank with White Cloud Mountain minnows, when the fish started dying at least one per day after another I was starting to get worried that my parameters were off and the shrimp would start dying soon. So I bought this on Amazon rather than at a petstore because they're double the price listed here. All my parameters were good, I noticed that one fish was kind of bullying all the rest, I transferred him out and nobody died after.Point is is this product is really great in measuring water parameters. I give it 4/5 because they could have added an extra test tube or at least a test tube brush."
5,Awesome product. Must have for fresh water enthusiasts.,"Comprehensive kit that test the 4 most common factors of water quality: Ammonia, Nitrite, Nitrate, and pH (high and low level). If you can find it for the right price, it's a lot cheaper then getting the kits separately, which is what I did in the beginning, not thinking I'd need the tests other then ammonia until all my fish died."
3,"Good kit, good price BUT...","Good deal on the price, however, 2 of the bottles, the nitite solution and the nitrate were leaking all over inside the kit, big stains, big mess, not shipped well.Came from petsmart via amazon, took a few more days, but overall okay. Big save over the rip off fish stores."
5,All the essential tests,This kit has it all. The instructions are very easy to follow and the tests are easy to perform. High quality test kit with all the essential freshwater tests included. A good value.
2,"NO GH KH tests, bad description","The description clearly states that this kit has these two water hardness tests included and it definitely does not. All the other tests are great but if you are like me and really wanted those two tests you will be disappointed. There is another review that states this, wish I had read that ...."
2,So so,The freshwater kit arrived fairly fast:). I began to test my water and found a leak in one of the test tubes. I was testing nitrate and it gave me a chemical burn. I was disappointed with the product. Also the Ammonia test is tricky to do. The nitrate test is even harder. You have to shake bottles and wait several minutes for results. Extremely disappointed.
5,Great product,This product adds more fun to your hobby you can always use the strips for quick checks but this seems to be more accurate.
5,Great test kit,"It does what it needs to, and we rest a lot easier now knowing that our tank is stable. The only concern that I have is a few of the color comparisons look exactly like one another. Not a major issue, but it can be confusing.This should last us a very long time. And anyone who is starting out a new tank should definitely pick one of these up."
5,AWSOME,GREAT PRODUCT AND GREAT PRICE!!! Highly recommend to anybody who needs to test their water to keep their finned friends happy and healthy. :)
5,Great kit,"This kit is a must-have for any aquarium. Very easy to use, the instructions are excellent: you really can't go wrong on how to perform the tests. I think it isn't hard to tell if the color chart matches your test tube, if you have problems try looking at it in different light conditions (I have found it easier on a room with white florescent lightning instead of incandescent lightning, for example) or ask a woman (most woman perceive color better than men!)."
5,Necessity for Aquariums,"This is so needed for any freshwater aquarium. I was doing a weekly water change of 5 gallons out of my 29 gallon tank. I thought my water was fine. Well, when I tested it with this, my nitrate levels were about 45ppm. For anyone who doesn't know, you're supposed to change the water at 20ppm. I was two times overdue the right nitrate level. Buy this kit and save your fishes' lives!Note: does not come with gh/kh tests like it says it does in the description. I wasn't looking for those so it doesn't make a problem here. It does come with pH, high range pH (if your pH is above 8.0), ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate."
3,just meh.,"Just meh.The plastic caps for the glass tubes don't actually seal even when you hold them down to shake the tube. This results in the liquid mixture dripping out and splashing all over. I don't like the chemicals getting on my floor, clothes, etc. Everything else seems to work OK. The high-range PH is hard to read because the shades of brown go from dark to light to dark as it gets higher, so there is about 3-4 degrees where it's hard to tell what it actually is.I'm going to be looking for a new kit soon with better test tubes."
5,Works great!,"As soon as it arrived I immediately tested my tank's water and found the instructions simple and quite easy to understand. Some people are complaining about the horrid ""6 minute wait"" and ""complex operation"" each test takes no more than 7 min MAX. 4 tests times four could set you back a grand total of....30 measly minutes. Hardly a sacrafice for highly accurate readings no? Also, at most, you will be mixing 2 bottles of chemicals with one test tube. It's not rocket science people.One last thing. The seller, for some odd reason, thought it would be a good idea to place the kit upside down in the box. Asleep at the wheel or just uncaring?"
4,Fast and great product,This product I received fast and works great. I thought this kit comes with a hardness test but it does not.
4,A must have for any aquarist!!,Great product and easy to use. Comes with 4 test tubes just in-case you break a few. Instructions need to be followed exactly to get accurate results.
5,Lifesaver!!!,"This handy little kit is crucial for any concerned fish-owner. I found out that despite frequent water-changes and ph stablilizer additions, my tank was still totally toxic with ammonia. This kit has everything you need to test for the big 4 problem chemicals, but it is also suuuper easy-to-use. The instruction manual tells you how to fix any problems that may occur, which is also really really helpful"
2,"Product damaged in shippment, and not able to return due to it contains chemicals.","Product damaged in shippment, and I can not return it due to chemicals related; I tried to use the Nitrate testing kit which seems be ok, those seem to worked fine."
4,Worked fine...,"Works great to get the real scoop on your water parameters. But instructions are a bit off. This is why I gave it only 4 stars. The instructions could be much better. Amazon as always shipped timely, and courteously.Overall I'd recommend this product."
4,"Very Good, vocals dont take away form the music.","When i first heard this cd i was under the impression that it would be just generic pretty Drum n Bass with some stupid rapping going on. Wow was I pleasantly surprised. The music itself is VERY good melodic jungle that reminded me most of Logical Progression 1. The vocals seem to fit perfectly with everything going on, not stupid at all. Very astral and at the same time sensible but not so much as too sound corny. I would like it if perhaps it was a double cd with an instrumental second disc, but thats like asking any record to come with a second remix cd. VERY good record, pick it up if you want to chill out on mars or dance on the asteroid belt."
4,Donna Williams is the best,"again, Donna Williams takes us through the eyes of an autistic person. Shes amazing, but you should read Nobody Nowhere first, because that is the stroy of her life, and it might help you understand this book more."
4,Salin' On The Sea Of Your Love,"Pastor Caesar's best album of the 80's. This album shows you the contemporary gospel side of Shirley Caesar. She starts off the album with the ""going back to church song: 'Lord, Let Your Spirit Fall On Me."" Then calms down with ""Star Of The Morning."" When Pastor Caesar made this album she had just got married to Bishop Harold I. Williams and she invited him to do a duet on the song ""Time To Come Back Home"" one of the best songs on the entire album. Al Greens shows up on the Grammy Winning hit ""Salin' On The Sea Of Your Love."" Pastor Caesar lets you know everything is going to be alright with the ballad ""The Peace Of God"" and haves church featuring her sister Ann Caesar Price on ""Rejoice."" Pastor finishes the album with an sermon/song perfect for Easter intitled ""Sunday's On The Way."" This is one album that lets you know that Shirley Caesar is the ""First Lady Of Gospel."""
5,just fantasic,"If you like soul music, you need to get this album. Goldwax records produced some great music, particularly James Carr and the first secular recording by O.V. Wright, ""That's How Strong My Love Is"", which was covered by the Rolling Stones. There is also some great stuff by somebody named Spencer Wigggins, and a lot of other good stuff. If you like this kind of music, you should get James Carr, ""The Complete Goldwax Singles"" also."
5,do it! get this album...,"i first heard this album in about 1994 and IMMEDIATELY fell in love with it. i am a lover of italian opera and McLaren's interpretion mixing the purity of the opera with some complimentary hip-hop was GENIUS. he didn't cross any lines or anything. my particular favourites are from ""madame butterfly""...my favourite opera of forever! i highly reccommend that you purchase this classic."
2,did not include gaskets which cost me another 5 bucks plus gas and time,"the filter was correct, but came in an openish box, so the gaskets (if included which they normally are) were not in there... took me an additional couple hours to get the gaskets , plus gas, plus 5 bucks"
1,Boring,"I kept reading this book waiting for something good to happen but it never did. Mr. D'Arienzo seems to be too fixated on gore, not coming up with an original story line. Most of his book seems copied from other, older books in the same genre. But with more vivid detail on the violence. That does not equal good storytelling. Also, I want to point out that I felt misled by the positive reviews of this book on Amazon.com. I think many of them have been planted to sell more books. The most recent one points out that the author is good looking, that has nothing to do with whether a book is good or not and besides, no picture is in the book! Honestly, this book is not very good. Finally, the grammatical errors are atrocious, ""Woodbyrne"" is misspelled on every page of the book!"
3,Blood and Gore is good food.,"Although the fighting scenes are impressive and the violence happens constantly in the story, the first of three series, Woodbyrne: The Fallen Forest contains a lot of grammar errors. I understand that this is a first print, but one major mistake is too hard not to mention. On the top of every page in the story, the word Woodbyrne was spelled Woodbryne on the top of every SINGLE page. I do hope that this error will be corrected soon.I enjoy the deaths that had occured in the story. Especiall when Bryam died. Be sure to bring in back in the later stories!"
2,Want my time back,"I just got to the end of this book, I can honestly say this is a bad book. I give one stars to books I can't make it through, I made it through this but would never recommend it to anyone. It's just not good, I don't even know where to begin. Awful."
5,awesome!,"If you see this for sale anywhere, buy it. I paid $6 for it, and am totally glad that I did. All of the games are awesome (FAKK2 and Rune are my favs). Very good deal!"
1,highly unreliable,"The first piece I ordered did not work. The replacement worked but one of the thumbsticks was behaving erratically. After misicing and matching components from the original and replacement set, i was able to make it work. But after a month of sparse use, the unit stopped working again! Until they learn to make more reliabile devices, keep away from these units."
4,GREAT CONTROLLER!!!!!,"i ogt this controller after christmas, and i think it is the best controller i have ever used. the only problem is that before i wore it in it sometimes would just stop sending a signal to the xbox. i thik it was because of the microwave in my house, or the phone on the same frequency (2.4). but it is a great product, more than i expected."
2,It's just OK!!!,"This book was a big disappointment for me. The stories were not that sensual.....yes the intimacy is hot but just not ""sensual or romantic"". This was one of those books where you see your favorite author, read the storyline and think ""hmmm this sounds really good"" until you actually read itIf I had to rate each story then of course Brenda Jackson's story was the best and Ice Princess could have been better...there was nothing sensual, erotic or romantic the entire story. Ms. Dawson's story should have been longer (it took me 20 minutes to read it) I would have liked to have learned more about the main character's dad and the hero's mother.If you want to read something with some very steamy moments then you might like this book........"
2,Poor fit and finish,"The assembly of this treadmill should not take more than 1/2 hour, but it took me almost one and half hour!!! Why, this is due to the poor fit and finish. They were 3 places I could not get the bolts to fit in no matter how I tried. Another place the bolt fitted in very poorly. I left with 3 bolts for 3 different places that I could not get them to fit in! Fortunately, they are not crucial. The poor alignment of the parts are just terrible!!! I have never encountered anything like this before. There is no way that I was going to pack this monster back for exchange because they were not crucial areas. Besides, what makes you think another one would have a better fit? This is the worst Chinese made product I have bought. I just hope the treadmill is reliable for a few years. Good thing that I bought the extended warranty. I would suggest that you stay away from Horizon products!"
3,get it used or on sale,"I didn't find it to be a bad book, but I wouldn't recommend it for planning a trip or vacation pasttimes of any kind. It's good for giving ideas and has some interesting information, also a nice spread of places around the world. It's true though that all the hotels and restaurants mentioned in it are obscenely expensive (another reason not to use it to plan for anything). There are much better books out there for planning a trip, most of which you can find in the travel section of any major bookstore."
1,Terrible,"This is the most pretentious piece of garbage that I have ever read. This guide book is only for those individuals who have a great deal of disposable income and time. The author's dependence on hotels and restaraunts for her ""places"" is worthless. Her complete ignorance of beautiful natural wonders gives me reason to wonder if she has ever been to many of the places she writes about. Anyone who wastes their money on this trash is simply perpetuating the stereotype that this author is a worthy travel writer... which she is not in this humble reviewer's opinion."
1,Pure Conde Nast,"Each of the 1000 ""sights"" is accompanied by a resumee. The first section of these is entitled ""What"" (others are ""How"" etc) - time and time again the entry is ""Site and Hotel"". Have the Hotels paid to be mentioned? I know not but even the most magnificent Natural and Cultural sights seem to get associated with a hotel!If you want to see the world a la Conde Nast then use this book as your bible. If not then start your lifetime plans with the UNESCO World Heritage Site list. Despite its undoubted ""Western bias"" it gives Africa and Asia a better shout than this book."
2,Go Where ... Why?,I love to travel and I couldn't wait to get this book. I have only read a few dozen enties so far but the majority of the places are hotels. Definitely not what I was expecting. Disappointing for me.
1,Useless,"This book is nothing more than a listing of places that we all already know about and know we should see. Nothing here is really 'off the beaten track' - this is just a large compilation of already famous places. You already know you need to visit the places listed in this book (ie South Beach, Leeds in London, San Francisco/Napa)."
3,too Many Four Seasons,"Though I am enjoying this book, I find there are a bit too many references to the Four Seasons Hotels as places to see before you die. While they are all truly lovely places to stay (if you can afford them), their place as a top destination to visit before you die is a bit suspect. I think of historical places, places of natural beauty, and entertainment spots as places not to be missed. Lux hotels will come and go and 50 years from now no one may know what a Four Seasons is, but hopefully the Grand Canyon will still be there."
2,Not Practical,"Thought it would be a fun book to read but too exhausting and not very pratical. Would not buy again. Fun casual ""no thinking"" birthday gift but that is about it."
2,Not what I expected...,"I was very disappointed with this book. The author did not include travel information that was very helpful. I thought there would be much more detail about the actual locations. Most of the entries were spent on which hotels are the nicest (and most expensive) at the location. If you are looking for a travel guide describing what's interesting and unique about various locations, I would not recommend this book."
4,"1,000 Hotels to see before yo run out of money","I liked this book. It has some excellent suggestions of wonderful, exotic, and worthwhile places scattered around the globe that would be amazing places to visit. I have seen almost 200 of them myself, and the descriptions in this book are accurate and useful.However, I was also a bit disappointed that for my personal preferences, there were way too many places listed in ""1,000 Places to See Before You Die"" that were not geographic wonders, but were hotels...all of them obviously 5-Star luxury accommodations. Places like that may be on the author's bucket list, but from my point of view, it made me wonder just how many of these establishments had paid a fee to be included."
4,Excellent service.,"The product was as advertised, very satisfied with what I purchased and the sellers service."
5,Ultimate Travelers Guide,"If you suffer from ""White Line Fever"", this book's for you. This 974 page ""dictionary"" is a must for any ""wanderlust"", who has not completed their journey - And certainly should be the ""Travel Bible"" for those who want to start a journey throughout the Planet. It is loaded with historical facts, statistics and to quote Newsweek, ""At last, a book that tells you what's beautiful, what's fun and what's just unforgettable - everywhere on Earth"". Though it's thick and loaded with information and history, it's easily navigated by State, Country and Region. Definitely is a 5 STAR -- It's so full of information, that even if you don't travel, but want to know about other lands and places, you'll love it. - Use it to put your wish-list together, set a ""Dream Itinerary"" and enjoy visiting unique, wondrous and amazing places."
4,Great Ideas,"This book is so fun. It is neat to be able to look at where you have been and where you want to go. It's also neat to see how many places there are that you never even knew about.it can make you a bit jealous not being able to go to every place but, it is fun to look at."
3,Great places but with poor pictures,"This is a great book of places to go to but you can never really feel the scope of anything here because the pictures are so small and in black and white. This book needs to be coffee table sze, huge!!! big!! and too heavy to carry around. At this size and layout it is missing its potential."
2,I Think I'll Wait,"Like some other reviewers, I found '1,000 Places to See Before You Die' aimed more at my bulging wallet and less at my burgeoning wanderlust. If it's all the same to Ms Schultz, I think I'll wait till AFTER I die. I suspect the places will be far more exotic and far less expensive. And I won't need to sell my share portfolio in order to tip the concierge."
5,What's wrong with hotels.,"I purchased the book just last week and love pouring over its pages. The destinations are indeed classic but there are many off-the-beaten and eclectic places listed. The book has given me many ideas for future trips. It's wonderful!One thing I love to do in any large city is to walk into some of its famous or historical hotels. In just about any city, you can sit and rest in the lounge (it's great when you're beat from walking around) and have a cocktail or coffee at the bar. I've done this at the Walldorf in New York, the Crillon and Ritz in Paris, the Delano in Miami Beach and recently the Balmoral in Edinborough without spending a fortune! It's just one more way to experience any city...You don't have to stay at the hotel to soak up the atmosphere or enjoy its lounges.I think a lot of people have missed the point about the hotels."
1,review of all the world's tourist traps,"Honestly you will not learn anything about any ""off the beaten track"" places. This book gave me the impression that it had been written by someone using a stack of travel guides and magazines as references, not a real traveller. Nothing original, it is a compilation of all the world's tourist traps and overpriced hotels. A crappy, overrated, uninteresting travel guide written by someone clearly obsessed with Spas and hotels. It is blatant that the author of this turkey got kickbacks and free hotels stays by mentioning some names... Sorry lady, a Spa is not a ""place to see before you die."""
3,a fun book to explore,"I really enjoyed reading through this book. If you want suggestions to general ""most-famous"" places all over the world, this is the book for you. However, I would probably just use this book as a starting point and then move to another travel book that covers more specific topics regarding your intended destination. Certain places, such as the middle east, are hardly covered at all. However, overall a fun book and a great gift."
2,America?,"The must see places to see in this book are ( over one half) in America. As an Australian and former European dweller,my feeling is that this book definately favours America.The writer must be very wealthy. The hotel costs are extravagant to say the least, and suggest that advertising hotels is part of the reason for the book."
1,Disgraceful Bias and Shameless Slant,"This is a slanted politically-biased listing with gaping omissions that are simply shameful and unacceptable. For instance, it lists no sites worth seeing in Lebanon, a country that contains 6 of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites; by comparison, for instance, the list includes 10 sites in Israel, a country that contains 6 World Heritage Sites as well (counting the one in Jerusalem as being in Israel, which is disputed still). I frankly can't think of a reason for the glaring discrepancy other than political bias. You'd think a fair and balanced list (not ala Fox News) of 1000 must-see sites would at least include the World Heritage Sites (the total of which is 851 properties ""forming part of the cultural and natural heritage which the World Heritage Committee considers as having outstanding universal value"").I recommend instead the gorgeously photographed ""Unforgettable Places to See Before You Die"" or Lonely Planet's far more comprehensive ""The Travel Book""."
3,More of a coffee table book,"While I agree with some of the other reviews that it seems weird to have hotel entries as places to see, there are still many sights that I would not have thought about seeing if it were not for the book. This book is not for taking on travel that's for sure. It briefly describes the location and by briefly, I mean some have only a paragraph. If for anything, I keep it on my coffee table as a conversation starter because people always ask ""so how many of the 1,000 places have you checked off your list?"""
3,Too many hotels,I liked the concept of a list but I did not like that many of the items listed are hotels. I think I can make my own hotel decisions.
2,It could of been a grand book,Its a good primer on the logistics and a good list of what to go see but thats about it.
3,random samples not too promising,I checked out the book's recommendations for two regions with which I'm familiar: Alaska and Massachusetts. In the case of Alaska the author recommends a couple of places that any 80-year-old on a cruise would be likely to visit. She does not mention Katmai National Park (where you can get up close and personal with bears catching salmon) or any of the other places that an Alaska resident might recommend. In the case of Massachusetts she recommends Legal Seafoods. This is a chain restaurant and if you're hungry in Washington National Airport it is a fine place to eat but it is hard to see how the various branches of Legal's qualify as one of the 1000 top places in the world.
5,THIS BOOK IS TO DIE FOR!,"I want to thank Patricia Schultz for this wonderful book. I am an avid yet average reader of travel literature. I'll read anything that beckons with taunting overseas jaunts and depictions of lively local color. But this book got its hooks in me. The perfectly concise entries, the teasing pictures--uncommon in travel tomes, and the witty, enthusings of Ms. Schultz all served to keep me up reading well past bedtime last night. When, close to 3am, I reluctantly put the book on the nightstand, I made a promise to myself. Through combining local and overseas trips, I am going to do my best to see thirty places in the next year. We'll see how I do. If I make it to them all I will up the ante for the following year. If I fall short, I will lower my expectations next time. However things pan out, I'm excited to give it a try. There truly is so much to do and such little time!"
3,This is the Bible?,"Before buying this book I had been told that it was the ultimate traveler's bible. As a traveling college student, I was excited at the thought of having an outline of possibilities, but found that almost the entire book was out of my price range. It was interesting to see the suggestions, and it was somewhat useful as a platform to jump from, but I could find better information on Lonely Planet or the like.If you are looking for budget travel, this is not the book for you. However, if you are lucky enough to afford the nicest accommodations in each town along your travels, it's a definite buy. As for me, I prefer for my hotel to not be the best thing I saw while abroad - I'll stick to the $5 hostels that make me want to get out into town."
2,A great book for hotel lovers,"This is my first review of a book for Amazon. I just had to write this to tell the truth about this book.For a person who loves to travel, I just had to purchase this book to see what places I need to go to and review places I have been to.According to the author, I missed a lot of places because I was too busy to vistit all the recommended 5 star hotels. For an example, Torres Del Paine, Chile is one of the most beautiful nature wonder of the world with its glaciers, lakes, peaks, and majestic views. Instead of writing this, the author decide to descibe in detail about the over-priced hotel in the park.Author consistently writes about:1. Hotel, hotel, and more hotels. Not just any hotel, but the most expensive accomodation in town.2. Hotels, of course. I have not counted, but I can guess about 250 places to see are hotels.If you like hotels, this is a book for you, otherwise look elsewhere."
2,A thick pamphlet,"I couldn't agree more with Sung Kim's review. I got this book as a gift and not knowing what to expect immediately checked the section devoted to Poland. Not to mention that there is a lot of beautiful, breathtaking places to see, but Patricia Schultz wrote about only three of them. Well, I am disappointed not finding anything about its heritage and the unique sites. I wouldn't say anything if the book wasn't named like it is. Suffice to say the author hasn't been to all the places and what she describes, her book does not deserve the title.If you don't know what to do on your holidays, just buy it. In other cases get a book that is all about the country you're going to visit.Treat '1,000 Places...' as a thick pamphlet."
2,"Good in Concept, Boring in Execution","I was really excited about this book. However, its actually pretty boring- Most things on the list aren't all that exciting that I would want to see them before I die!"
1,Very disappointing book,"This is a very disappointing book filled with too many common touristy destinations and too few surprises. The majority of these places are too touristy to warrant the ""see before you die"" recommendation. What a waste."
3,"1,000 Places to See Before You Die","Have only read about 1/3 of the book so far. It has some interesting places I've never heard of in the book, along with places everyone knows. However, I must say most of these places you can only visit if you're rich, as many cost a lot to get there or to stay there. Also, I would've liked it better if the photos were in color."
3,Decent if you know nothing about a place,"This book includes many places that truly should be places you need to see before you die, but then there are also a number of places that are simply interesting places that make me wonder how they got into this book. There are a disproportionate number of hotels in this book while excluding many fantastic places that will provide you with great experiences."
4,"Too Many Places, Not Enough Information About Each One","This is a fun book to browse listing many interesting places around the world. Since there are so many places listed, you will most likely find one or more in your own ""backyard."" All in all I found this book to be quite frustrating. Due to the large number of places provided there is a minimal about of detail on each place. I would have preferred 500 places with twice as much detail on each place. I think that would have been a better balance."
5,This Is The Perfect Gift,"Of the dozens and dozens of presents for their 30th wedding anniversary, my gift of ""1000 Places"" was my parents' favorite by far - suggested to me by an extremely well-traveled family friend who knew they were at a loss when trying to plan their 2nd honeymoon. I have since gone out and bought another copy for myself - I am not all that well traveled myself, but intend to be, and now I have the best imagineable travel guide ever written - and likely to be the only one I'll ever buy. This one says it all and with all the local suggestions in California and the neighboring Four Corners Area (I'll save all those on the other side of the globe for down the road) I intend to start this weekend - who knew what I was missing???."
4,I HOPE I REACH A 100 BEFORE I DIE!!!,"I hope I'm lucky enough to hit 100 of these places before I go, but no matter what, this book is a fun and educational read. I find the balance of the classic and well-known sites intriguingly balanced with places and things I've never even heard of.Patricia Schultz has painstakingly gathered together an awesome list of places and events around the world - then tells us why they deserve our attention, when to avoid monsoon season (or high season rates) and how to get there or have it arranged by a specialist-outfitter if you don't have the time to plan it yourself.Ms. Schultz' '1,000 Places' doesn't let you down. All the entries are organized by geography and they are further indexed by type, e.g., ancient worlds, culinary experiences, festivals and special events, unrivaled museums, glories of nature, etc., so that I could continue to 'plan' against a backdrop of alternatives to challenge my final choice.A bit daunting, but useful even as information only"
5,My Favorite Book Ever,"Not only did this book take me to so many wonderful places, obviously many of which I will never visit, but it did so in such an easy, enjoyable, informative way I don't really mind not actually going to them.The author has a wonderful style of writing and presents entries in a full but concise, very digestible way. She has included an amazing array of items - something for everyone's taste, location and budget.Not only does she include the usual reference index in the back but she has also created another fabulous, very useful gloabl index categorized by special interests such as biking, sacred places,music festivals, etc. It inspires the reader and also helps give an interesting overview other than the list of contents - check it out first!I never need another travel book - this will keep me entertained and busy for years! I am giving it to everyone on my christmas list."
2,A bit disappointing,"For someone who really enjoys travelling, this book might be adequate, but the author doesn't seem to know anything about actually getting out and experiencing the culture. You can skip this one. wwr@virginia.edu"
2,More pages devoted to just UK and Ireland than entire African continent...,"This is not a good book. Rarely do I give a rating so low to something that's not erroneous or just plain broken. Perhaps if you only plan to travel to Western Europe and the U.S., it may highlight a few bed and breakfasts that you might have otherwise passed on, but there are still many better books out there.This book devotes about 90 pages to the UK and Ireland, and about 50 to all the countries of Africa. It generously devotes 97 pages to the entire continent of Asia. In China, there is no mention of the entire city and region surrounding Shanghai. And yet countless inns and gardens in Europe and the US are mentioned.I love traveling (I've been to just over 40 countries). And there probably ARE a 1000 places I'd like to see before I die. But I certainly won't be using this guide to do it. Hillman Wonders of the World is a great website that highlights 1000 places throughout the world and does so much more even handedly."
4,Been there...,"All in all, a pretty fun, useful book. While it shouldn't be used as the ultimate resource for any adventure, it still offers some great suggestions and tips. In checking out some places I've lived around the world, I was mildly surprised both at the author listing places I wouldn't suggest, and omitting sites I'd rate as don't-miss... but any travel guide would have such shortcomings -- especially one with as broad a subject as the entire world.On the bright side, it's put some locations on my itinerary that otherwise would have been left off -- for that, I thank the author. Each site's cost estimates and best time of the year are great helps, too.And finally, a friend that has lived all over the world with the State Department was given this book as a Christmas gift, along with a rubber stamp to mark the pages with ""Been there... Done that."" I thought that was brilliant."
4,What an amazing place Earth is,"In case you have forgottan, the Earth is a very wonderful place. This book reminds you that there are still lots of places to visit and things to see!However, like all lists you might not agree with the authors list of places to visit. Especially, if you enjoy the ""road less traveled"", you might miss the spirit of exploration in some of these places mentioned here. But well, there is a reason that lots of people go to see the Eiffel Tower or the pyramids. Obviously the best things cant be hidden. Moments of serene beauty off the beaten track, you wont find in this book, thats something you will have to find yourself. Again, its ok, you still want to see these 1000 places mentioned in this book.-Simon"
4,Great travel ideas!,"This book contains both luxury priced and reasonably priced options for places to stay and things to do. I like the options given for travel around the world, even to out-of-the-way places."
1,not worth it,"i agree with the reviewer 'tldoran': one star out of 5.i read about 120 pages of the book, concentrating on the u.s. and hong kong, the two locations i know the most about. and almost everything in these 120 pages are predestrian. one can't help but wonders if the author actually had spent quality time in the places that she wrote about.again 'tldoran' hit it on the head: so much about restaurants and so little about places that one would love to see before dying.in all, the title is the best part of the book. it goes downhill from there."
1,Very Disappointed,"While this book does, indeed, list many worthwhile places to see, some of them unknown to me, a huge number of the entries are just for great hotels, read expensive. I am not a hotel collector. If you aren't either, skip this book. Even the entries for neat places skimp on info about the place in order to include a long plug for a nearby, luxury hotel. There are only a very few hotels that should qualify as places to see on their own; I didn't know about the ice hotels, for instance, and those might be a kick and fairly amazing. This book was maybe not a total waste of money, but not worth the full price, either."
2,Hotels to See Before You Die,"You could eliminate about half of this book and make it ""500 Places to See Before You Die"" by taking out the references to the posh Hotels around the world that you should visit. It seemed more like a book that was written as a result of the comps that the author received than an actual travel book. (T'ain't the way I travel.) I bought the book expecting more and eventually sold it to a used book store."
5,From grand hotels and wildlife preserves to castles,"1,000 Places To See Before You Die chooses the best 1,000 places guaranteed to offer the most to adventure travelers, from grand hotels and wildlife preserves to castles, hidden islands, and more. An organization by country makes it easy to tailor a memorable trip around a given destination, while small black and white photos and clear overviews of attractions make for easy planning."
1,Too Anglo-centric and hotel/resort focused,"I was extremely disappointed by this book and the very anglo focus that it has. Nearly 100 pages are devoted to Britain, Scotland and Wales. Same for the U.S. While I agree there are some very interesting things to see in both places, the world has other more interesting places.Perhaps the author could have devoted a few additional pages to asia for example at the expense of the endless inn's and gardens in England. For example, the author overlooks Nikko, Japan which is a World Heritage site. Also no listings for anything in Korea, a country of amazing heritage, food and art and yet nothing!Better off buying a lonely planet guide and going from there."
1,Is she kidding?,"I found this book weak at best. Alot of ""ritzy"" places to stay and no surprises. I love to travel, but I dozed off reading this book...."
5,The Best Travel Book Ever,"I am a veteran and pretty savvy traveler and even I was blown away by the magnitude of this travel book. No one has ever attempted a book of this scope before - and not only did the author get it all together, but in the most intriguing and poetic way. Her diversity of interests perfectly reflects my own and I love the way she effortlessly mixes backyard secrets (the Du Ponts' Winterthur Museum in Penn.'s Brandywine Valley) to the international icons (India's Taj Mahal, so beautifully described), the cheap and quirky (Chicago's Superdawg)to the extravagant and over the top (Cunard's brand new Queen Mary 2)- and 996 other gems that I've either done and agree with wholeheartedly or look forward to with a newfound enthusiasm. I'm off the couch and on my way!"
5,"The perfect ""idea"" book, but not a guide book",My husband and I caught the program named after this book on the Discovery Channel HD and the view of sunrise over Machu Pichu actually brought tears to my eyes. He picked up the laptop and ordered this book for me on the spot and I have been so happy with it. We have little red dots next to all of the places we've been and it really gives a lovely synopsis of the high points in any given area. As far as we can tell all of the tips have been very accurate and we look forward to finding out more about all of the wonderful places in this book.
2,Money Money Money,You'd need to be a) lottery winner b) famous or c) a damn good hitchiker to go see all these placesI was gutted there is hardly anything about the UK! There are loads more places than mentioned to visit... made me seriously think about writing my own travel guide.There are also some places I have been that are not mentioned in this book yet they are said to be amazing places.I've gone through the book ticking off places we've been to and adding dates but even if I died at 230 I dont think I'd get to all these places!Some good travel tips inside and inspirational for anyone who doesnt know where to go next on their travels.
1,I'd Die of Boredom,"Ms. Patricia Shultz should stick to things she knows best, things ""Made in Italy."" If I took her advice to see all 1,000 places before I died, I'd die of boredom, plus I'd be bankrupt from staying at all the 5-star hotels listed as ""destinations.""Her LIMITED travel experience outside Europe and the North America is painfully obvious - take the laborious 213 pages devoted to North America and 339 pages on Europe, and compare that to the 96 pages for all of Asia, and you'll see that Ms. Shultz was lazy enough to elaborate ad nauseam on things close to home. Either that or she didn't think there was very much worth seeing outside of the western hemisphere."
2,Are you kidding me?,"As a native Missourian, I was officially offended that the ONLY great place mentioned in my home state(according to the author) was a (drumroll...please....)barbecue joint in Kansas City! Patricia, you clearly have not been around this beautiful state enough to know where the ""places to go"" actually are. Why didn't you just leave us out altogether? With all of our natural attractions, historic monuments, national and state parks, caves, museums, and countless other ""secret treasures,"" it seems sad to me that a silly dining establishment was all you could come up with. Sorry, you lost this reader...."
2,Somewhat disturbing,"I've travelled a bit in my life, but have by no means tried to keep up with trends in travel destinations. The whole contemporary craze for travelling itself has more or less passed me by. As I get older, though, I tend to get increasingly anxious about all the places in the world I haven't seen yet, and a book like this is bound to present me with many travel ideas I hadn't considered. The book's emphasis, though, presents a somewhat disturbing scenario to all potential readers. On one hand, it's good that, by making the list so long, the author is encouraging us to live for a long time, but what about those of us whose time is running out? For an untravelled person in their autumn years, 1000 places is an awful lot to be expected to get through, and attempting it could even shorten whatever time they have left. Conversely, younger, well-travelled people, who have already been to all 1000 places, will be disturbed to learn that they have nothing left to live for..."
1,Title offends me,I've seen this book in a number of bookstores. I have terminal cancer and everytime I see this title it makes me wince.
1,Places to see if you're a millionaire or fast food conniseur,"Maybe I'm being a little critical, but I was extremely disappointed with the authors selections. She chose many high-end expensive restaurants rather than great historical sites. Charlie Trotter's in Chicago? Why not spend $1000 less to see a ballgame at beautiful Wrigley Field. You'll be able to spend more time there, plus catch a baseball game while you're at it. Also, I was upset to see that a rib restaurant in Tennessee surpassed Rainier National Park or the Olympic Penninsula as a sight to see. What about the salt mines in Krakow or the Alambra in Rhonda? For the author's sake, I suppose you do become wary after the first 500 places. Eventually you want to go to $5000 a night spa in Jackson, Wyoming (yes it is one of the mentioned places to see) and dictate a travel guide from there."
3,Great places -- mixed with some tourism PR,"Wow -- so many of the places the author describes sound fantastic and unique and amazing. The Pyramids, the Alhambra, the Great Barrier Reef, etc. Great recommendations. But mixed in with all of these are hotels and restaurants, which while good and worthy, are for the most part not you-must-see-before-you-die essentials (in my book). The other problem with including such places is the fact that for the most part, the included hotels and restaurants are completely unaffordable for all but the wealthiest traveller. Unlike Donald Trump, many people have to save pennies to travel, and if I have a choice of seeing an amazing thing while staying in a sub-par hotel, I'd ALWAYS choose that over the ritzy place. But with that minor complaint, much of this book left me drooling to get on the road."
1,Eurocentric and narrow world view,"1000 places to see before you die. . . according to this author, who is unabashedly eurocentric and has a frighteningly narrow world view.184 pages devoted to the USA. Ok, I'll allow this granted the author is American. But. . .38 pages for England and only 9 pages for Egypt?43 pages for France and only 12 pages for China?58 pages for Italy and only 14 pages for India?Need I say more?"
2,"should be titled ""1000 Hotels to See Before You Die""","I love to travel so I grabbed this book as a perfect tool for planning trips. Unfortuntately, while it's certainly interesting for the arm-chair traveler, it's pretty useless if you actually want to see 1000 places before you die.In fact, many of the listings are little more than press releases for expensive hotels and restaurants. For example, out of 13 listings in Argentina, nine are hotels and one is a restaurant, leaving only three authentic sites to visit. This pattern is throughout the book, in every chapter I examined.I guess if you want to stay in expensive hotels around the world, then this is the book for you. But if you actually want to SEE and EXPERIENCE the place, I'd look elsewhere."
2,Is there life beyond USA,You can tell that the author is Americian. An extraordinary number of the places to see are in the US. I'd rather a more balanced book that took me beyond places to eat in USA. Give me some substance.
3,No what I was expecting....,"I know that in order to cram 1,000 different places in the world into one book, you are going to have to be as brief as possible, but still present enough details so that people reading the book might be interested in visiting a particular location. Well--the book gives great ideas for places to see, but just not enough information to keep you from having to go other places to do more research for your trips. Overall--not great, but not terrible either."
3,not sure about practical use,"I bought this book for my son as a graduation gift. Symbolically it is a great gift I think. Practically, the book was very dry. It really is just a list with stats on the places. I didn't care for the format and it read like an encyclopedia. Small print, thin pages."
2,Take it or leave it...,"I picked up this book hoping to be able to add a few more places to my ""need to see"" list. I will admit that I was able to do so; however, it frustrated me that this author seemed more focused on the expensive hotels in certain areas than on why one should actually go there. Personally, I could care less whether I see or stay in some $500/night hotel in, I don't know, Rome, as long as I get to see the sights and experience the culture there. That said, she did bring up some places that I now wish to see, but all in all, I wasn't too impressed with this book."
5,1000 Places to See Before You Die,What a fun book for travellers!!! This book just makes me realize how many more places I have to see before I die!!!!
2,Good idea gone wrong,"This book is poorly designed and poorly organized. Moreover, it assumes that you'd like to go to all of these places as a part of an all-inclusive tour package. I'm convinced that the majority of people who buy this book will never travel anywhere. Like other reviewers have said, this book is really elitist. The weird thing is that the author recommends some seriously out of the way places that the ""all-inclusive"" type of traveler would never want to visit in the first place. A good enough gift, but not much in the way of real, useful content."
1,Disappointing,"the book is more like a publicity, contents can be found in any travel website. Besides, it's missing the middle-east region, while concentrating on Europe and America"
2,Insulting,"342 pages on Europe.45 pages on Africa.As many have pointed out, the list is so skewed and biased as to be insulting. The writing is often not useful, or focuses on misleading aspects of an area. Why talk about the hotels and not the sites?The other review I find useful is that this focuses often on things to see, not things to do. Besides, as another reviewer pointed out, it simply isn't adventerous: often discussing going to locales to see a place, instead of the expereinces of traveling and actually engaging in areas.And just to reiterate:342 pages on Europe.45 pages on Africa."
5,A Great Traveling Companion.,"This book is filled with advice on what to see from the huge life-changing moments, to the small happy times moments. It is a great collection of ideas. And it covers any and every destination you could hope to find yourself in. It is easy to follow and understand, making it accessible to everyone."
5,Great Book,This book is well researched and current. You can plan a trip solely on it and not be disappointed. Excellent read even if you're not vacationing.
5,1000 Reasons This is The Perfect Christmas Gift,"Christmas, graduation, anniversary - everyone on this globe, well traveled or nervous beginner - deserves this hefty tome on their beside table. So what's with all the warped reviews? Ms Schultz is not saying these are the only places to see on this big, wide, wonderful planet, but just her own personal lifelist that she eagerly and gladly shares with us -- and how lucky are we?!?. There are 1000 x 1000 x 1000 possibilities out there, but as far as I know - and I think I've paged through every travel book ever published - she is the first brave list-maker to take a noble shot at compiling an inspiring ""short"" list of things great and humble, serious and fun, in the USA and waaaay abroad, that should get us going and encourage even the most lethargic of us off the couch. I agree wholeheartedly with the 98% of the myriad critics on this site (I've never seen an Amazon title get so much response) who give her 5 stars. Can I arrange for a 6th?"
3,"Cute little gift book, nothing special","Nice to give as a gift for someone you can't otherwise figure out what to get, but honestly, found it quite boring overall and not particularly original. Stuck it on a shelf somewhere where it will now stay until and unless I can't come up with a vacation spot I want to go to without it..... right... that's going to happen."
4,Impressive book,"A useful book for anyone who likes to travel. Schultz has not targeted a certain group of readers, so in the book, there are places for both luxury-lovers and for the low-budget backpackers (well, mostly the first group). If you have no idea where to go, you may try reading this book and then pick somewhere you think you will enjoy.However, if you are a low-budget backpacker, or one who likes the ""hostel culture"", you may find Let's Go series more useful."
4,Great resource,This is a great book! I was surprised by how many places and events I have already been to. The only reason it did not get a 5 star is they don't have maps to give you a better idea of where these places are.
2,Where are the restored versions?,"American Movie Classics restored ""THE LODGER"" from 35mm with original tints, yet the version they showed on their cable channel still eludes the DVD collector. Don't waste your time with this poor quality DVD, wait for AMC to release theirs.As for ""MURDER!"", an excellent version of this was released over a decade ago on Laserdisc by Image Entertainment, why the hold out on DVD? Again, wait until the good copy gets released."
1,"better copies are out there,look for them",both these movies are very good but you would never know from the poor prints that are used here. really very poor transfers hurt stories that both depend on strong visual scenes. skip it
3,Better than most - but not much,"""Murder"" looks at least as good or better than 3 other versions I have. It also includes about 8 minutes that was edited out of Laserlight/Delta's version. You will notice different print quality and tints here and there. They must've used the best they could find (copy).""The Lodger"" looks better than other versions I have, too. It has a new classical score and new title cards- which can be a little distracting at first.I'm sure there are better prints out there based on the other reviews, but for now, it's OK."
5,Read it and sip,"This book is the perfect complement to martini hour. It's filled with interesting historical tidbits, quotes, and photos of famous martini drinkers and the beverage in question. It's a great gift for any martini fan."
4,No complaints,"The book arrived in like-new condition, as advertised, securely wrapped (but without padding, which might have been unnecessary). My only complaint is that ""Media Mail"" is painfully slow, while costing nearly as much as First Class Mail. I would recommend that booksellers spring for the extra 25-75 cents, except when a book's weight otherwise makes Priority Mail mandatory."
5,"Very good, enough to learn and use EIGRP","Very nice, enough to learn and troubleshoot EIGRP without all the other wasted space. Short book, good to use as reference manual also."
5,Lov'n This Little Fryer,"We couldn't wait to use this ""little wonder."" We made apple fritters and it worked beautifully. They were juicy, crisp and absolutely yummy.This fryer is small, and just right for two people, but we have done batches for a larger group, just had to be a little more patient.Sharon & Larry RichardsonLos Lunas, NM"
4,Cuisinart compact deep fryer - Love this little giant,"Very compact, goes with my other cuisinart stainless steel cook-top appliances. Has washable/replaceable carbon filter that removes odor. I use peanut oil and it gets 375 degrees in approximately 12 minutes. Extremely good for frying frozen items like fries, samosas etc. One discomfort I felt is the pan is not removable from the electical unit; so, I can just hand wash. Other parts are dishwasher safe. Also, when the frying basket is in the up position, you cannot close the lid; so you can't prevent the oil smell from leaving your kitchen. I do have the bigger model CDF-250C, which has been discontinued in the US but still available in Canada.Overall, I am satisfied with this appliance."
2,Kimber,Not a great product for the price good only for 1 person deep frying. Have had much better fryers. Plastic lid broke second time using it.I would not recommend it to anyone.
4,Great SMALL fryer,"Have been using for 2 months with excellent results. Quick, simple instructions. It is very small but great for just 2 people.Maximum heat setting is 375 F."
2,Teflon coating is wearing off too much.,This is not a stainless steel appliance as the description indicates. It is plastic with a metal looking trim. It is a very cheaply constructed item. I think you can get a better value in white colored unit. The non stick coating began wearing off after the first use.
1,Horrible Product,"We just purchased this and was so excited to use it... we took it out of the box, filled it up, and tossed the box. When we were waiting for it to heat up, we waited forever! It would not get over 200 degrees. Deeply disappointing and we can't even return since we tossed all the packaging. Don't buy this product!"
2,Not big enough for a family of four,"I just purchased this product, based in part on the reviews I read and because of the great price. However, it is much smaller than it appears and the single basket is tiny! One small potato cut up for fries would practically fill it. I'd give it 5 stars for looks, because it is a nice looking machine, but it just doesn't stack up to my old fry daddy for size. In all honesty, we are not even going to try it out, so I don't know how well it works. This one is going back to Amazon (thanks to Amazon for the easy return process) and we will continue shopping for something much larger to fit our large ""fried-foods-are-our-friend"" appetites."
1,MAD DOG,"THIS IS JUNK IT'S GREAT IF YOU WANT TO BOIL EGGS.I PUT ONE CORN DOG IN FRYER AND THE TEMPITURE DROPS AND IT JUST SITS THEREIN OIL.SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY A FRY BABY.BUT I DID LOVE THE CONCEPT OF THE SIZE AND LOOKS.AMAZON YOU NEED TO TAKE THIS OFF OF YOUR SHELF, BEFORE YOU LOSE MORE CUSTOMER."
3,What is the real wattage of this product?,"Amazon states that the wattage is 1650, the manufacturer's website states that it is 1000. That would equate to an enormous difference. Which one is correct?!?"
5,Don't eat alot of fried food but some times got to have,I don't eat alot of fried food anymore and my family has become health nuts but some times u just have to fry some things because the oven just does not work. It is the perfect size for that little something you must have. I bought one for myself and loved it. Perfect for just me. I also bought 3 more for my Healthy Kids.
5,Best LIttle Fryer in town!,"I have this fryer for myself then bought one for my daughter. We both love it. It heats quickly, cooks evenly, and cleans up just as easy. If you have a large family with a large appetite you will have to make more than one basket full as this is small but it heats so quickly it still may work for you. When we have family over I do more than one basketful & it works fast enough that the first basketful is still warm. I would recommend this fryer to anyone."
4,RIght size!,This is a great little fryer. You don't have to use the basket if you'd like to fry a little more. Just use a non metal dipper. Hot enough for the best fries ever!
4,Nice For Two Servings...,"...but I am baffled as to why a good bit of the batter sticks to the bottom of the basket no matter what. I've used two different batter recipes, have thick and thin-coated the items, use peanut oil, tried heating the basket or keeping it out until loading, cook only 4-6 items at a time, always add items only when it has heated up to Ready...dunno. Other than that, it's compact, stores well, heats up fast and evenly, cooks beautifully, no spatters, easy to drain and clean, no scratches. I almost want to throw food in without the basket and then fish out with a spider or tongs.For the price, a great deal."
4,Very good home frying,"This is a stylish little unit that offers really great tasting results. My one complaint is that it is not dishwasher safe and you have to wash the main housing completely by hand. But it looks good on the counter and produces crispy tasty fried foods, so pretty good for the price."
2,Big loser in a small package,"I have had this fryer since November 2006. At first, this little fryer seemed to be the greatest. My family uses a fryer very often, and we have had several larger ones. That being the reason this one seemed so appealing, the size. There are many problems we have encountered with this. The basket has folded up many times when emptying out hot food resulting in 3 burns. The tab on the top which houses the filter broke off within the first 2-3 cleanings and the plug continually falls off the back. I have also had the oil spurt out the top filter. The size is the only positive thing I can say about this fryer, all the other I have owned were very big and bulky. In the end size does matter, I will go back to the larger one."
2,"Faulty thermostat, low temperature","With the temperature dial set to 350, the green ready light turns on at 280. The temperature continues to rise to a maximum of 305. With the temperature dial set to 375, the oil will eventually reach 350, but go no higher. I tried cooking a batch of small egg rolls - one at a time - and the temperature couldn't get back up to 350 before each one was cooked. I love the idea of a compact fryer, but the heating element in this one isn't up to the task; the food comes out too greasy."
2,Does not get the job done.,"Bought this one to replace my fry daddy. Since my kids have moved on, I dont need a large deep frier. I chose this one, relying on the Cuisinart name. Unfortunately it does not come close. I made one potato cut into french fries, and they came out soggy,(even after using their cook two times method). Be careful when you lift the cover because it flies off and falls on the floor. I should have stayed with my long time reliable deep fry daddy."
4,nice little fryer,"bought this for my daughter in law. I already own one and find it easy to use and easy to clean. Like that it's small and doesn't take up much space. One bad thing for me was that the lid broke off at the hinges (plastic), but it still fits on tightly when needed."
1,Thermostat problems,"I've now purchased two of these units. I like the compact size but both units have failed with exactly the same problem: the thermostat. In both units, after a few months of casual use, the until will not heat above 300, even though the control knob is set to 375. I'm now searching for a replacement unit of a different brand."
1,Big Disappointment,I got this fryer yesterday and was very excited to use it because we have two little ones so we thought it was the perfect size for the amount of food we needed to fry instead of having to heat up a larger deep fryer. Unfortunately our unit didn't get the oil hot enough so our chicken nuggets and fries would sit and soak up all the oil. I've used other fryers before and this one is by far the worst. I'm not sure why it didn't heat up but we are returning this one and going to try out another fryer.
3,I like the size...,"We mainly use this fryer for side dishes like french fries and stuff like that. So, we don't need a big amount and this fryer is the perfect size. With that said, there is always plenty. The basket is 7"" length x 5"" wide ""x 3 1/2"" deep. The only reason I am rating this a 3 star is because it just doesn't get quite hot enough. So, it makes it so you have to throw out your oil after using it only twice or else it just doesn't flash cook like it should. Other than that, we like it. It is very easy to clean. You just add some water and a bit of baking soda, turn the machine on hot and let the water boil in there. Then, you just dump it out and it is clean. We do put the basket in the dishwasher."
4,perfect size,For 2 people it's great.Due to its size it provides you with as guilt free deep fat frying as possible.Lid is a little weak
1,Broke in less than two months!,"We were so excited about this deepfryer. Our previous one broke after a short while so with this one tried to do more legwork. However, within two months it stopped working. We don't know what went wrong but the circuit or something is fried. It won't heat up anymore. And of course it is just past the time we can return it. DON'T GET THIS FRYER! HUGE DISAPOINTMENT!"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"What a piece of junk. Never heated up properly yet said it was ""ready."" Complete Garbage! So after throwing in the garbage, I figured I might as well keep the basket to dip into my pot when I heat oil on the stove. Nope! The black handle still gets so hot that you need an oven mitt to handle it. What a piece of junk this thing is. Good for nothing."
1,Did not like...,"I had a big, bulky but very nice one but we have very little counter space so tried this one instead. Maybe I am comparing my nice old one to this one...and could be why I am so disappointed. The Cuisinart has a turn dial with temp read for 325 and 375 but just dots before 325 so you gotta guess the temp. Which I guess I could get used to. But I went to time my batch of fries...no built in timer. Disappointing. Went to open the lid when done...used the small lip on the side of the lid and burned my fingers as the steam rolled up and out. Still hurts. Went to turn it off...and no on/off switch so have to just unplug. Some of this may seem minor and I guess I was just used to these little frills. But I am going to be looking for a different deep fryer none the less."
1,Evertyhing sticks to basket,Purchased this little fryer for seafood frying. Have tried multiple batters and they all stick like concrete to the basket. Called Cuisineart and they said that you need to use their recipe for batter. Have already tried that and it still sticks. No difference in oils. The fryer is flawed. It does not get hot enough. Save your money!
2,"Heat Loss, Hard to Clean, Food Sticks to Basket","After first use, goes downhill from there. Loses heat, does not get hot enough to make foods crispy and the food then sticks to the wire basket making a mess. Is a pain to clean. They should make the inner container removeable so you can take it out and clean it easily and properly. The whole thing is a hassle to use, is messy, oil splatters all over it and really makes it a chore to cook in it. I dont like it at all. bought it at a local store and am going to return it and say good riddens! also bought a tin canister at that same store to store the oil after use and that too is a mess and a pain. plus this fryer is only big enough for one person and one food in your meal. if you want to fry more than one food - your meal aint going to work. because you have to cook one thing at a time and when you fry food you cannot leave it out because it gets soft and limp."
1,Deep fryer not as advertised,I was disappointed with this item. Number 1 it has no timer as in the description. It is small and takes long to recover heat when you put in food to deep fry.
3,Parts are missing...,"The tab does not have the complete songs...You get either intros, bridges or solos...In fact, in the opening portion of the DVD, he plays the solo for ""One"", but then doesn't actually teach it to you!! Still, on the parts he does teach he plays things slowly and then at speed, so it is a worthwhile teaching tool...My intro and solo to ""Nothing Else Matters"" now sound like they should!"
4,wish it is was bigger,Great pan - i use it on the stove and than it goes right to the oven. This is extremly convenient. It's also looks pretty stylish for serving. So it's kinde of multipurposed. The only minus it has - the size. I wish it was just a little bit bigger.
5,I love this pan,I have several All Clad but this is one of my favorite. I find myself using it almost every day. Great size and of course great All Clad quality.
3,Too small for Cassoulet; but quality made,"I didn't pay attention to size when I ordered this. I'm sure it will work well for dinner for two-three. I hope. But it's not the right size for a ""family"" size casserole. I guess I now know that a Fench ""cassoulet"" is not same a size as typical $7.00 mac-n-cheese glass casserole dish. I'm sure I'm going to get my moneys worth out of this cooking & serving gravies, veggies, & rosato. I agree with the other comments, this is of equal quality as the others products in All-Clad stainless line. So I guess I don't need to by that Asparagus steamer now... Too bad b/c I was so looking forward to it."
4,Great Book for Beginners,"This book is written for novice/intermediate .net developers. Most chapters cover basic topics and don't go into in-depth details. The chapters covering ADO.NET and Data Access are very basic and only someone that has no experience with ADO.NET should read them. However, the book is useful for studying for the exam and covers all exam topics. Experienced users should look for a shorter."
4,Pretty Good Book,"Not for the light reader, the book has one thousand pages of guidelines, detailed information, hands on labs, review questions and quizzes. The final sections of the book contains a full review, an actual exam and a section on SQL basics. Found the book contained many excellent illustrations which delved into the details of Windows Services, Web Services, COM+, SOAP, Remoting and other distributed topics. Recommended over the 70-320 guide by MS Press, but if you have time. Read that one first followed by this one to ""burn in"" the subject matter."
2,Errors & Bugs Galore!,"I started using this book as the basis for my study for the exam. I never completed the book because it became such a waste of my time to try to figure out why the application didn't run. Many of the exercises appear to have been copied from the 70-316 book, but never adapted for the ASP.NET environment. Fifteen pages of errata, and that didn't cover half of the bugs and errors. Stay away from this book! Use MSDN - it is far more reliable!"
1,Not worth the money...,"I found it insulting, being constantly told ""you will learn"", as well as time consuming reading through what I will learn instead of the details needed to learn it. Just present the information and if I read it, I will learn it, if I don't I won't."
5,"Great book, easy to read, very relevent, to the point","The book is very useful. It has lots of practical infomration, yet focused on the goals of the exam. This was the only book I used to pass the exam on the first try. Although I did have practical experience as well"
3,Much too long and slow,"While the information provided in this book seems to be quite good, I gave up on it somewhere in the middle of chapter 2. At the pace of this book, it would really take forever to learn, and I was just bored. The book moved slowly, providing new information in small increments with exercises for each. That could be a good way for many to learn, but I felt it could have provided the information faster, and consolidated the exercises. As it was, I lost patience, and never read most of it."
5,Best Overall coverage of Web application Development with C#,"This book covers all the aspects of Web application development with C#,with step by step easy to follow examples and tips.Worth buying this book not only from Exam passing point of view but as a general reference."
5,Great Book,"This book has everything anyone needs to take the test, either a newbie or one who had a expert knowledge of C# ASP.NET. The CD contains an online version of the book, which I found very useful. For a newbie the examples and practices are very helpful which can be found throughout the book. And I totally appreciate the way the book is organized, is really great.On the flip side, I wish the exam questions behind every chapter to be a little more open (instead of focusing on what have been learned the current chapter so far), since the real test updated on a regular basis.I would definitely recommend this book to majority of the people."
4,Bottom line is I passed the test.,"I used just this book to pass the test with a score of 900. My only disppointment with the book is the exam that comes on the CD. The quality of the questions are not very good; although, I think it is only there to entice you to buy the full set of test that they market on the publisher's website. Other than, though, the book does a great job of covering all the relevant topics on the exam and I found the large amount of exercises extremely useful at driving home the material."
4,Good but need a little more,"I found this book really good, especially when I did not have a whole lot of experience with ASP.Net. The book covered most of the required topics in enough detail and the practical exercises helped with understanding of topics that I had less knowledge of. However, the practice exam included is nowhere near hard enough as a representation of what to expect. I used this book, the included practice exam, along with the Transcender exam and found these were enough to pass the exam first go."
3,Pretty good...,"I bought this book a while ago, read it over the next few months, stopped, continued, did the prep exams on the book, did the prep exam on the cd. I didn't feel to confident but managed to pass nonetheless.The thing about it is though the book contains a lot of stuff that you won't necessarily find on the actual exam. That's why for my next exam(webservices one), I bought a Exam Cram book. I should mention that I use ASP.NET and Web Services almost everyday at work. I got most of the dev type questions right with full confidence but missed quite a few on configuration type ones. I just remember reading lots and lots about accessibility and internationalization stuff but only found 1 or 2 q's on those. Instead I found majority of q's on actual usage of Data controls and found some on C# itself. Quite surprised but better for me. I just can't believe I made sure to remember <html dir=""rtl""> but it didn't show up on the exam :)Buy Exam Cram books if you are a .NET developer."
4,Wish they stacked!!,"I love All-Clad pots and have several pieces. They are the best I've ever had - particularly for my smooth cooktop. However, I'd have MORE if the saucepans stacked one inside of the other! I have a 1-1/2 qt. saucepan and 4-1/2 qt. pan, but my three others are old Farberware because of the stacking problem. Why not change the dimensions somewhat? With all the wonderful things for the kitchen most of us can't afford to give up space to non-stacking pans."
4,Wonderful product--but no lid,"All-Clad is fantastic, and this is a great pan. It retains an even heat, and it is dishwasher-safe. On a more superficial note, it is simply beautiful to look at. I love it.Buyers should understand, however, that it doesn't come with a lid. Not that the promo copy promises a lid, but I think most of us expect a lid when we buy a saucepan. The lid from another All-Clad saucepan I already owned fits this 1-qt pan, so this didn't make a huge difference to me. But I might have been perturbed to buy this and then find out I had to shell out another $... to get a lid for it. People should be aware of this."
4,Nice SMALL pan,"Bought this pan for the great Amazon price. Loved the look and the finish, it's perfect for heating a single serving of most anything, heats quickly and evenly. I did buy the lid (cost more than the pan) but it fits tight and keeps the stove clean. Use low heat and it won't boil over. The pan DOES discolor rather easily, but I make sure the next time to cook something with a tomato base and it's as good as new. I use it for sauces and side dishes. Combine this with the Calphalon pots and you've to a kitchen to die for."
4,"Great Value, Great Pan","OK, I bought this on an Amazon deal. [money]. Wonderful pan, unbeatable at that price or even at twice that. Really thick bottom proved terrific for the first sauce I made. Too bad it's from China as opposed to the good old USA.....otherwise, it's a keeper."
3,Below Usual All-Clad Quality,"Great weight and conductivity. Diameter is compatable with a small electric coil burner. But made in China, not the USA. And the interior has a dull finish instead of the usual All-Clad mirror finish. The dull interior finish creates a detracting abrasive feel when using metal utensils."
3,great oversized butter warmer,"Butter warmers are somewhat difficult to find, and for the price, this is an excellent substitute (where it succeeds in small capacity, it does however lack the 'spout' bend in the rim).I only wish it was made in the U.S. as most All-Clad products are (my purchase was from China)."
5,The Sweetest Taboo,"I purchased this DVD because at the time, her greatest hits CD was sold out. As luck would have it, it was on sale in the DVD section of the store. I won't divulge the price, but I will admit that it was a lot cheaper than the CD! I bought it, and Oh My God! The videos encompass the majority of her hits. What an exotic, sultry siren. Words simply cannot describe this artist. All the hits I was looking for were there. So now I have a choice. When I just want to see her beautiful videos with alluring story lines, I pop in the DVD. When I want to hear her beautiful music, I simply turn the television off. Lucky me! Enjoy!"
5,Absolutely Wonderful,"I have had this DVD for about a week now and I can't stop watching it! SADE is such a diverse band and this DVD covers all of their amazing videos to the T. You can really see the progression of the band in the videos shown on this DVD. From ""Your Love Is King"" to ""Nothing Can Come Between Us"" to Cherish The Day"", Sade Adu seems to get more beautiful.(Stuart Matthewman, Andrew Hale, and Paul Denman are cute too :) This is a must for SADE fans!"
1,a kids revew this game sucks,do not buy this game i mean when i played it i started crying i was so mad i tore the game up ( of course i got in trouble)i went crazy man i starting punching everything in the house the mirror broke the tv fell and of course broke
3,Def. a game for kids!,Def. a game for kids!This game is not very entertaining more like frustrating and am sad to say but I would have been better off buying a different game. It is a bit difficult to get through even the first level even for kids my son cant even get past it and hes our gamer of the house all the way!
1,Finding Nemo with swearing and Rap,"After listening to this dumb game yell ""Oh G**"" for about 5 minutes I turned it off on the kids and they have never even asked to play it again. I am returning it as soon as I get the chance. The shark chase scared my son (who likes the Hobbit... ie. not easily scared by a game) and all the stupid fish kept yelling was ""Oh G**"". It maybe could have been a cute game but not worth it for the play and the profanity. If you find that even games are getting offensive language and hate it send a complaint and return it. I have sent the complaint to Dreamworks and will be returning it!!"
1,Terrible game,"This game is the worst. You have to make it through each level to get to the next, and it's hard even for an adult. It's the absolute worst game ever. They don't even warn you, on the box, that you have to complete each level before you get to the next. My son kept asking when he could play the dancing part, and how he could find Angie. We never made it past level 2 and are returning it immediately."
2,Don't be mislead by the 2163 mg,"The product is fine, but be forewarned. I thought I was buying 100, 2163 mg capsules, but not so! The serving size is 6 capsules, so each capsule is only (approximately) 360 mg each; not the bargain I thought I was getting. I realize that the serving size is shown on the page, but no where does it specify that the 2163 mg mentioned in the product title, ""Vitamin Shoppe - Caprylic Acid, 2163 mg, 100 capsules"", is by the serving size and not per capsule as the product name implies. I feel this is misleading, thus only two stars."
1,RIPPED OFF WITH NO WAY TO CONTACT SELLER !!!!!!!!!!!!!,HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!The product I purchased is showing that it was delivered and I ABSOLUTELY HAVE NOT RECEIVED IT! I paid over 600 dollars for this item and I want to know where it is ASAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!It was a kitchen island. The manufacturer is Michael Scott although I do not know if that is who shipped it.I need answers and I need them now!S. Rice
2,I know a real Hutch,"I have been searching for a Red Hutch. I found it and it does not cost 500+ dollars. It is more modern than this one, has more cabinet space, towel rack, granite top etc... I just think this price is ridiculous for a simple cart like this one"
5,"After a couple of listens, you get hooked...","That's something I think we long time fans forget: we never truly appreciate her work until about the 4th or 5th time we listen to it. Aimee's songs are long-lasting. I still listen to Whatever and it still sounds as fresh today as it did when I bought it (on cassette no less!-- I have upgraded to CD since then).It's an interesting concept album that I wouldn't expect from Aimee, but it totally works. The last two songs (""Clean up for Christmas"" and ""Beautiful"") truly tug at the heart strings and end the album on a positive note. She dedicates the album to addicts and alcoholics, so it's probably a good thing she ends with some hopefulness, eh?"
4,Emotional wallop,"Every time I play this CD it gets stuck in my head for a week. A rare story-oriented album that works as both a narrative and a collection of individual songs. The plot sketched by the songs is elliptical but coherent - a boxer/addict and his long-suffering girlfriend set out on a road trip, try unsuccessfully to outrun their problems, split up on a dark sad night both agreeing it was best (to steal a line from Zimmy), then reunite tentatively and hopefully. The melodies and arrangements are powerful and catchy, and for an old 70's guy like me, the production is stellar. Yes, there are instruments panned hard right and left, and that's just where I like them! I want to hear the piano, guitars, organ, drums, bass and voices interact with each other. I'm no fan of the Spector/Springsteen wall of sound, and although I like some modern production tricks (Wilco in particular), I prefer it old school like this."
5,awesome!,"i love every song on this album. i must say however, that it took me a long time to come to that conclusion. i bought this cd years ago and spun it a couple of times. it didn't wow me instantly so i put it away and forgot about it. about a year ago i dug it out and gave it another chance. i love it!"
5,Amazing Amy,"Listening to her is like turning on the radio in the seventies and hearing great singer/writer cuts that exude warmth and naturalness. The writing as always is trenchant and the production and mixing is absolutely superb. As if that weren't enough, the cd packaging is in book form replete with artwork / lyrics and a photo of Aimee on the back that is as beautiful as the music contained within."
4,The songs stick in your head,"I first heard these songs on iTunes, and I kept visiting iTunes to hear them again, so I got the album. At first it sounded very different from Lost in Space, which put me off, but on subsequent listens, I realized Aimee Mann just keeps getting better and this is the next stop in her evolution.The concept of this album, about an alcoholic boxer and his relationship with a woman named Caroline, is loose indeed. The recurring themes are failure, fear, addiction and unhappiness...and yet the music is not unhappy. The melodies are smooth and beautiful.My favorites: ""Goodbye Caroline"", ""Going Through the Motions,"" ""That's How I Knew This Story Would Break My Heart,"" ""I Can't Help You Anymore."""
4,Aimee Rocks,"Yes, this is album assumes a different approach than its predecessors, but after a few listens, the bluesy, piano-laden, country sound will win you over and have you coming back for more. I have been listening to it for the past two weeks, and its addictive effect has finally overtaken me. Watch out singer/songwriter wannabes, Aimee is coming with the knock-out punch!"
3,"Ok, Liked Lost In Space a lot more","I've listened to this a dozen times or so now and while I do find the themes/tunes memorable, it starts getting a bit bland by the 4th or 5th tune. The problem is that all of the songs sound so similar in composition that no one track really stands out on it's own.A good example to show the difference is to go back and listen to Lost In Space. ""Invisible Ink"" is a slowish pop song - and a very likeable one at that. The very next track, ""Pavlov's Bell"" has a much harder sound with distorted electric guitars, heavier beat, and a faster tempo. In contrast when I listen to TFA, I hear the same mix of instruments and similar tempo in nearly all of the songs. It's that lack of variety that, for me, makes this CD not as good as Lost In Space.I might yet grow to really like this CD, but it's probably going to take a lot more listening for me to get to that point."
5,Activated my son's interest in reading,"Before readng this book my 9 year old son liked the idea of reading but had never taken it up with any gusto. However, he just could not put this book down and as a result wrote his first ever book report entirely by himself, for whch he got an A+ mark.Now my son is hooked-on-classics. Currently he is ready the Three Musketeers and he has Treasure Island all lined up and ready to go when he is done.This is a fine book from a great series. Many thanks."
4,Robinson Crusoe- An Adventure of a Lifetime,"Steve Smith""He felt his lungs ready to burst, his head and hands shot above the surface of the water. As the pull of the sea tried to drag him back out again, Robinson dug his feet into the sand."" Robinson Crusoe is about a man, who is 18 years old, is stranded on an island, and no one thinks he is still alive. He encounters many challenges including cannibals, building a new house, making tools, and making a boat.In one scene he has to build a fortress to protect him from the cannibals. He had wood log fence, a lookout tower, a retractable ladder, and many weapons. His house was very secure from the cannibals, but took him three months to build.I really liked Robinson Crusoe, even thought I don't really like books where people are stranded in the wilderness. I would recommend this book for all ages and usually boys would like it, but some girls would also like it."
2,Very simple edition,"This is really a ""dumbed down"" edition. Since I bought it for my five year old grandson, I'd call it acceptable. Were he ten years old, I would have returned it."
3,This book was good,I saw it in my teachers shelf. I looked at the cover and it looked interesting to me. I read it in the beginning of the year 2003.Robinson Crusoe was sailing in a violent storm and it destroyed the ship. Next day he built a fort to protect himself from wild animals. In the beginning of the story he is on a island alone. But at the end he meets some indians.People who like adventure would like this book.
2,Kindle version: margins wrong,The margins on this book are wrong... the left margin is much wider than the right. I find this very annoying. Just a warning for those of you who get annoyed by such things.
2,Felt like a college assignment,"Robinson Crusoe was my book club's choice for June. Only 2 out of the 12 of us stayed with it and read it. Crusoe indeed did live a fascinating life, but it is told in the most boring, tedious manner. Defoe's style of writing is dry and unemotional. I did remind myself the book was written almost 300 years ago, and was fresh and different from other novels written in the 1600's. I have read many wonderful tales of wilderness survival: Island of the Blue Dolphin, Hatchet, and The Cay, so my expectations were high. Defoe spends too much time on mudane daily activities and not enough on Crusoe's feelings. Most of the ""juicy stuff"" of interest happens in the last 1/4 of the book. I wish I had spent my time reading The Great Illustrated Classic version, this book desperately needs paring down."
3,Robinson Crusoe,"I just finsished reading Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe, and let me tell you what a long story it was. It was written in old english, so at the start it was very confusing and hard to understand. But if you keep reading you get the hang if it. I thought it was a pretty good story. I think it would be so hard to live on this island all by yourself for twenty-four years have hardly anything. Then finally one day save a prisoner that ends up your friend, Friday. Followed by several more joining yor little island. The plot was good, and well written but it seems to drag on. Until the end, when he gets all these companions. The end went by so fast. First, he has all these friends and then they leave for England. He sells his plantation, gets married and has three kids. I gave it three star because it was hard to understand but very well written."
2,Didn't like the language it used,Using archaic English and capitalizing every noun might have added to uniqueness of this version of the Robinson Crusoe but I am not that artistic and personally prefer my books use plain English. That's why I returned the book and will be looking for another version that uses plain English.
5,The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe,"The Adventures of Robinson CrusoeThis book was outstanding!!!. Daniel Defoe writes another amazing adventure of Robinson Crusoe. This book is about an adventurer who get's stranded on an island. His name is Robinson Crusoe, and he was born in England. One day when Robinson and his crew were on a boat there was a bad storm and they had to jump off the boat. They swim for shore and make camp.This story takes place on an island. The main characters are Robinson the adventurer,Friday - the slave, and Friday's father. These characters learn how to be friends and fight and work to get off this island. I recommend this book for anyone who likes action and adventure."
2,Chick filet book,"The book was a book Chick Filet gives out when you buy a kid's meal, kinda chincey, I was expecting a real book."
5,Amazing,"This book is simply a must for everyone interested in the animals of Madagascar. When people think to mammals of Madagascar immediately think to lemurs... but this wonderful book, with incredible pictures and very good texts, remind everyone that Madagascar ain't only lemurs (no problem, lemurs are also described in the book very well, species by species... amazing pictures and interesting descriptions and informations)!! the fosa, the other species of civets and mongooses, the bats, the giant jumpin rat and the other rodents, the tenrecs, the bush pig..Wow! Big up to Nick Garbutt"
3,Change - Phats & Small,"UK CD Maxi Single Track Listing for -""CHANGE"" - PHATS & SMALL ft. TONY THOMPSON1) Radio Edit - 3:372) Phunk Investigation Extended Vocal Mix - 8:103) A Small Phat One - 8:052001"
4,Excellent value for money,"This book is excellent, it explains simple maintenance jobs with well illustrated diagrams for easy understanding. There are valuable hints included along with most maintenance tasks and this is certainly a bonus. Well worth the money and a great item for a new avid cyclist."
2,todd downs book is so much better,"like some reviews have stated, this book may (or may not) explain some things better than zinn or other books. but come on, it is such a waste of space. it spends a lot of time covering really dumb stuff. it's really dated and out of touch as well. its description of a single-speed freewheel: ""mainly used on kids' bikes"""
5,Blue Rodeo-A great Canadian secret...,A friend recommended Blue Rodeo a year ago and I now own all of their music. They have a great sound and really moving lyrics. The Days in Between is my absolute favorite and I'm so happy that their CD's are more easily available in the US. Hearing them LIVE is the about only thing that could be better. They are GREAT!
3,A good effort,"Ok, heres the deal. The opening sequence was very well done, the gothic style and mood to the movie was also effectively achieved. But the character development was horrid and the final scenes of the movie seemed to be rushed. The final scenes, the whole summoning of Baphomet/sex scene and the rise of the damned set-piece could have used some more time I think. And who cares about those characters who were introduced later in the film. And why are the two seemingly main characters almost totally forgotten at the end of the film? Anyway, those are just some of my gripes and considering most italian horror films, those kind of gripes would be pretty standard. Overall it was a decent movie, good gore, good opening sequence and i'll leave it at that."
