5,billy wilder proves his namesake,"an excellent performance by billy wilder, jack lemmon, and shirley maclaine. definitely worth watching for everyone. potent humour and drama all at the same time. the only complaint is about 20-30 minutes of overlength, which is typical of most good movies of the time (i know, a sweeping generalization -- but i find it to be true for most good movies of the 40s, 50s, and early 60s). worth owning"
4,We liked,This isn't a laugh a minute movie with slapstick humor. It's very subtle about an average guy who managed to get himself into being taken advantage of some big wheels where he works. Great acting all around.
4,"""Shut up and deal!""",Lemmon succeeds in business by REALLY trying as he lends out his apartment to his superiors for their trysts. A minor plot point fails in that Lemmon never lets on to the doctor what he's doing. If there's anyone who's seen it all its a NYC doctor who makes house calls. The fact that the Doc never is allowed to know what Lemmon is doing just doesnt make sense. Though he wouldn't approve of what Jack's is pulling it would in an odd way make him more of a MENSCH to the MD. Also the film's last line beats the last line of SOME LIKE IT HOT by a mile for meaning and humor.
3,A Look Back,"I watched this on the advise of a friend who thought this was ""an essential"". Robert Osbourne praised this on TCM too.Robert Osbourn commented it was neither a comedy, nor a drama but something in between or in it's own class. My friend thinks it is ""hysterical"".Everyone has opinions, sometimes they contradict as is the case with my view of this film.I think in it's day, yes it probably was hysterical.I think the problem is its aging badly.Also, I was not convinced a man would really sleep on a park bench rather than keep his job ranking.This is personal opinion."
4,Excellent Movie,"Billy Wilder was one of the great directors of all time and this is one of his great efforts. Great performances by Jack Lemmon, Shirley MacLaine and Fred MacMurray as the boss. It is rather dated now but it is still an underappreciated classic."
4,The Apartment and Crowe's Almost Famous,"The Apartment is one of Cameron Crowe's favorite films, as he has said in writing, and it is obvious to anyone who has seen both The Apartment and Almost Famous. The comparisons are many but the key comparison is in the central role of the woman with a big loving heart being used by powerful men, being treated poorly and discarded. The attempted suicides are parrellel in both the way they play out and their positions in the dramatic structure of both films. I don't want to list all the details but wanted to point this out to anyone who might enjoy looking at the influences and the development of a great work in relation to another great work. All best."
5,Great Billy Wilder Movie,"Billy Wilder made some great ones and this might be his best. Jack Lemmon was terrific as usual, Fred MacMurray had the creep role down perfect, and Shirley MacLaine was just so damn beautiful in this."
5,A gem!,"Jack Lemmon gives an outstanding portrayal of C.C. Baxter, an insurance company employee for Consolidated Insurance in Manhattan. C.C. has been secretly lending the key to his apartment to co-workers so they could bring their mistresses somewhere to have an affair, often leaving him locked out. Fran Kubelik [Shirley MacLaine] is an elevator attendant in the office who C.C. has a crush on. Little does he know that she's been having an affair with his boss, J.D Sheldrake [Fred MacMurray], in his apartment.I have never seen a movie where drama and comedy have been mixed together so well. The Apartment is one of the finest movies I've ever seen. The acting from all of the stars is superb and the writing is wonderful. In 1960, it won the Oscar for best picture, best screenplay and best director [Billy Wilder was great] and deserved all of them.Although there aren't any special features with the DVD [the clarity is great, though], you don't care with a movie this good."
5,A Movie Sensation! Best Wilder Film Ever!,"This movie is an amazing movie. I just saw it yesterday and I must say that this is now one of my favorite movies of all time. This is a timeless tale of love, romance, and wrong desisions. Billy Wilder has done an amazing job with this movie and it is his best in my opinion. Though Sunset Boulevard was excellent, this is better. Many plants and payoffs that work to the greatest effect, timeless lines that come from that golden age of movies, and pretty visuals make this movie great. Also, an astounding performance by Jack Lemmon! I had never seen one of earlier movies when he was younger and now I wish I had! In sight of his recent death and also Billy Wilder's recent death, I also think this is a commemorative movie that they made together. This movie is also known as being Cameron Crowe's favorite film and is known to be shown in History of Film classes for film students for it's impecable excellence. A must own for any film lover."
5,Wonderful performances,Loved the story and the humor in it. Jack Lemmon was fantastic in this one. You loved to hate Fred MacMurray as the slimey boss that gets his in the end.
1,DVD Spotlight Error,"The new 30-minute ""DVD Spotlight"" documentary inexplicably identifies co-star Edie Adams as character actress Naomi Stevens, a real shame considering this was Adams' last appearance before a camera, filmed in the final months of her life."
2,The Apartment - Collector's Edition,"I'm VERY disappointed with this product, because I was misled about the FORMAT as listed in the product information. I first considered ordering the ""Regular"" DVD, but decided not to do so because the format was listed as ""Widescreen"" which I don't use. The ""Collector's"" edition did NOT indicate widescreen - I only learned that AFTER I received the product and read the packaging. Had I known this information earlier, I would definitely NOT have ordered this DVD!"
4,After first play though kill kill,You just kill lots of stuff in this game and they try and kill you!
5,The best single player game for the PS3 as of September 2007,"The PS3 came out with a mediocre selection of games. I still regret having spent $[...] on the system, only to live in frustration for the rest of the year because there is nothing worth playing out there (exception: Oblivion).ENTER NINJA GAIDEN.Excellent graphics, excellent controls, fun to play, good sounds and music. This should be the benchmark for most games.I didn't like, though, the unnecessary enhancement of Rachel's [...]. Too big and bouncy... ridiculous. Also, the need to shake the controller for some actions (increase magic effect, escape from enemies) is boring.However, I really recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun game."
4,Ninja Crappy Controls Sigma,"Yes the controls are the only downfall. it just takes a few weeks to get use to it, after becoming a ninja gaiden gamer you'll overlook this, sort of. for me the controls suckd till the end of the game. I actually think I died more from miss jumps than the enemies...great story, great graphics, looks cool. The other Ninja Gaiden games boss fights should of been more epic like these. pick it up if you want a true ninja warrior challenge."
4,Fun Game,"I was very excited when I heard that the Ninja Gaiden series was coming back. While upgraded from its original side-scrolling action, Ninja Gaiden still retains the hack n' slash mentality as you move through the game. However this time, with good story elements. This game delivers the same type of challenge the originals did back on the NES."
5,This is the best game ever created!!!!,"I just got this game because i needed a knew game to play and when i played i was stuck on it for hours mind you i only finished the first level, this game is extremely hard and fun i am only on stage six up to date (took me a few weeks) my favorite level is the one when you first start playing as the girl i love her weapon it is like a giant scythe. This is the best game i have in my collection (and i cant wait to get my hands on gta IV ). If you do not like games that are 2 challenging then do not buy this one but if you do this is the game for you.!.!. Also if you like this game you will also like God of War."
5,Are you upto the challenge?,"This is the hardest game I've played in a LONG time. But b4 I get into all that, let me cover the basics.graphics: amazing graphics. characters have no apparent edges, and the lighting glistens. A true 3rd-generation experience, especially on a HD set-up.sound: once again great. music is thematically appropriate, and the clank of steel on steel reverberates.now getting to the meat of this review. The game is HARD. Where most action games inevitably become a redundant festival of button-mashing...tecmo has done an outstanding job maintaining a challenge that requires actual skill and reflexes. Most games that are ""hard"", just up the ante by adding more stuff to kill, or making you die easier. This game is hard b/c it requires you to actually have hand-eye coordination.If you are upto the challenge, this game is more than well-worth the money. GET THIS GAME...you will want to replay this game after a few months after you complete it, if not right away."
4,Great game for the PS3,This is one of the best games to come out for the PS3 so far IMO. They did a great job bringing it to the PS3 so that it doesn't feel like a port from xbox. The visuals are stunning the controls are quick and the fighting is a lot of fun. The game is rather hard though and can be frustrating when you are getting overwhelmed with bad guys so be prepared for that.
2,To damn hard!,"Maybe its because I'm not 16 but I think this game is just too hard. I started on normal, as I do most games, and Barely got to the 3rd stage. I can appreciate developing skill to beat a game but this is crazy. I stopped playing because I got tired of dying. Give me God of War anyday of the week. At least they give you a chance to learn before they throw a thousand guys at you at once."
2,Misleading reviews!,"Be aware that, although the graphical enhancements are great, several of the game's cinematic sequences (including Alma's first appearance) have been altered and cut, possibly for rating issues. Also, one of the most attractive rewards upon finishing the game (the movie theater) has been deleted completely, making Ninja Gaiden Sigma an overall inferior game when compared to Ninja Gaiden Black for the XBOX. Get the latter if given the choice."
1,Game is too difficult,I hate the fact that they don't let you select a difficulty setting. The first boss...first one mind you...was really difficult to defeat. This game sucks
4,Much Beter On PS3 over xbox360 minus a few old cut scenes tossed in.,"This game was a great redo. Excellent graphics and sound. The reason for the missing star was due to the fact that some of the cut scenes were not redone for 1080p. there is a mix of old school graphics in with the new on the cut scenes only. You can definitely tell the difference. Aside from laziness of dev. team to redo all cutscenes, the game is great and worth owning. I got the game for $30 a target on a markdown so it was a steal for me."
5,The absolute pinnacle of gaming!,"I have to admit, Ninja Gaiden goes above and beyond the call of duty when it comes to your gaming experience.....This game is an absolute treasure and masterpiece.... Nearly all aspects of this game are near perfect. A true experience, and a true testament to the fact that games can be more than the sum of their parts.....You need Ninja Gaiden in your collection..... and I can say that the sequel, Ninja Gaiden 2, will probably be close to being as good as the original (counting Black, and Sigma)......Continue the legacy and get into Ninja Gaiden today....and don't let the tales of the difficulty fool you.... this game is NOT impossible..... you just need to take a small amount of time and LEARN a few special techniques...... the game is balanced VERY well, and very reasonable for ANYONE to play.....Buy this game TODAY! It's never too late to enter the world of Ryu Hayabusa!!"
3,Not sure why this game is so popular,I agree that this game has excellent graphics moves and everything that you need. However I am stuck with the difficulty level and game play of the game.I believe the game play is quite repetitive and the moves are really difficult. How am I supposed to remember a five or four button sequence just to perform one move. It irritated me. I spent 40 bucks on this game and think it is not worth this much.
3,Ninja Gaiden,"This is a good game. It's the slasher style game, like onimusha or devil may cry. You just have to keep hitting the buttons and blocking at the right time. Not to challenging but enough to keep you playing. The graphics are great and game play and controls are very smooth. There is plenty of adventure in this game but the fighting and many different weapons are all kind of the same. If you like onimusha you'r love this game."
1,Still Wack&Now Playing Catch Up,I have Never Dug No-Limit.I Give Master P Props For Making His Rack.that's all He is About is $.It Isn't Music Or Lyrics.the worst part is that he is now playing Catch up to Cash Money in Production.Looks Like The Army Tank has Ran into a Detour?as if it hadn't already.
3,ummmmmm...,"The 504 Boyz cd isn't bad, its just very repetative. All the songs sound pretty much the same. The worst part about this cd is that it is just a big commercial trying to sell more No Limit stuff. Why bother waste space on your cd with music when you can put commercials for No Limit clothes and the new Mean Green cd. All in all if you like the classic No Limit sound this cd isn't bad, but it just really doesn't have any stand out songs. I would suggest that you get the new Big Tymers cd instead."
4,NO LIMIT'S BACK!,"This album was definitely worth the wait! No Limit is coming back in the Y2G! The best song is Wobble Wobble, but some other tight songs are Roll Roll, Whodi, If You Real Keep It Real, and Movin Things! This is a must-have for ALL No Limit fans!"
5,off the hook,Man my dogs or of the hook ever bout need to get this cd because no limit was falling but now i heard this cd they not falling any more...
4,No Limit is coming back -- Finally,"Finally No Limit put out a hot joint. I waited almost two years for this CD and Master P and the crew didn't disappoint. Though 504 was supposed to be MP, C-Murder, and Mystikal, they've added the rest of the No Limit camp to the record. And yea, Krayzie sounds a lot like 2Pac. But that's a good thing, like Vince Carter's fade-away looks like MJ. Not taking his place, but definitely learning some lessons.And no matter what MP says in The Source, he's spittin' at CMR on this record. ""Ain't no block to hot, we bout to open up shop! "" Yea, we gettin' some static with these two. Not that I want to see it happen, but if it does, this could get interesting.Give this joint 3 listens, and you'll be fiending for the next No Limit release again. Like Mystikal's new joint, which will probably be the best No Limit release since Ghetto D."
3,"Half of da songs R good,da other half ain't good","Dis album starts well wit' 4 good songs,but after dat it goes down 'til We bust,dat iz a good song.Ater dat there's a bad remix of Thug girl,my favourite song Life is serious,2 good songs(although Moving things is sumthin' is an interpratation of 2PAC's Can U get away).After that there's a bad 18th track,one good song-Enemies,'N' after dat thereisn't nuthin' interesting except RBX's sample in Souljas.If U R a soulja buy dat!"
4,2PAC IS BACK,"EVEN THOUGH MASTER P'S MUSIC IS REPEATITIVE THIS CD IS TIGHT BECAUSE THE NEW NO LIMIT SOUILJAH SOUNDS LIKE 2PAC (KRAZY), IT MIGHT ACTUALLY BE 2PAC BUT ANYWAY IF YOU LIKE 2PAC THIS CD IS PERFECT FOR YOU. SNOOP, MAC , KRAZY, C MURDER, SILKK, MYSTIKAL, PEACHES, AND THE WHOLE NO LIMIT CLICK DID A GOOD JOB!ITZ DEFINTELY WORTH BUYIN IF YOUR A NO LIMIT FAN"
1,"Man, whatever...","You wanna know why I hate on so many new commercial albums? Because they all suck, that's why. I don't waste my money buying them, I waste my time making fun of them. That's why I write these reviews, cause all of these groups need to stop. 504 Boyz come with nothing on this album but the same old crap that No Limit has to offer: the same repetitive beats, the meaningless lyrics, and even advertisements for their latest gear. Man, if you found this album even remotely interesting, then I'm glad, cause you deserve the punishment of wasting your money on this senseless waste-of-time they call ""music"" (huh, don't make me laugh). IF YOU DON'T HEED MY WARNING THEN YOU'LL FIND OUT THE HARD WAY."
4,i'm impressed,"it took a while but it's here 504 boys really made an impressing with me with this album actually the songs are hot and he didn't even work with ""beats by the pound"" and that new member krazy sounds a lot like 2pac that's one reasons why it's so good.if you want a good no limit album ge t this one it's hot."
2,Disappointing,"After holding out for the entire CD from the Goodfellas, I raced out and purchased it. Needless to say, I was disappointed. The first few tracks are slammin'. They bring you back to the old ""Soldier Style"", but as the songs progressed, my intrest rapidly faded.Though the story-telling on this disc didn't captivate me. The sound quality and thunderous bass lines did. If you are in search of tracks that can compliment your sound system, this is it. However, if you're in search for P's comeback album, keep looking."
1,Please deliver me!,"Good voices and good musicians, but absolute tripe. Unbridled vulgarity, racism, obscenity, and juvenile posturing. If this piece of trash has any redeeming social value, it escapes me. Is it a reflection of the society that produced it? Only if we are ignorant animals without a speck of morality. Shameful."
2,NO GOOD!,"what kinda shyt is this man 4 real tho,.,.its bad a nuff that master-p's stealin pacs stuff and bader the3n that thay got a 2 pac sounding wannab on the cd' its no good i hope nl digs there self a depper hole u dig thats my hype of the hole deal,.,.the only tight song waz wobble wobble,.,.witch is off magic's disk,.,i wish dezz cash money cats and dezz nl's would leave are quit this rap games real twisted now lol"
1,What is this garbage?,"This is the Worst CD I Have ever listened to, I must have listened to it for like 5 min and threw it out the window. Master P Should committe Suicide! 1 Love"
1,"Disappointing, Boring Rehash","This was a very disappointing book, compared with the 3 CWG books previously. It feels very ""forced"" and contrived. It's also quite boring and discusses boring subjects (when compared to the other 3 books). The ""New Revelations"" are nothing new at all. Just cliched repetitive statements that were in the other books in some shape or form. I think this book really cheapens the other 3 and makes me wonder if it was written only to ring in a cash-cow and make some more money. I dont think there's an ounce of spirituality in this book and I don't think it was inspired by any spiritual forces. I think the author plain wrote it - no ""conversations"" involved. Forget this and read something else..."
1,Really?,This just sounds so overly 'consumer-istically' inspired its sad...G-d and capitalism amazing how strong those visions can be...this is saddening to say the least...
1,A poor excuse for a book...,This is a book for those who try to be so politically correct that it's sickening. Believing in a god that doesn't punish evil is disgusting. If this author had spoken with the true God he would see how far off base he really is. The god he spoke with was either one of Satan's minions or his hunger for money. One can only hope the the true God that punishes evil can work some form of good out of this book.
2,unpleasant surprise,"I was used to Rosetta Stone and Instant Immersion, so I was greatly disappointed that the Pimsleur product is conversational only without any graphic verbiage. I chose it because time was short and I didn't want to spend a lot of money, but it would take lots of time to get any use from Pimsleur. I bought an inexpensive guidebook with excellent instruction on pronunciations and got along adequately. As always, knowing other languages facilitates the learning process, and it's always fun, but Pimsleur was not for me, so I'll out it on Craigslist and hope to get some money back."
4,"Flawed adventure, but invaluable source material for Mystara","The ultimate pulp jungle adventure! Following in the footsteps of X1, The Isle of Dread, this epic sends the heroes into a GIANT wilderness beyond the reaches of the Known World - wild rainforests, dinosaur-infested islands, spice caravans, exotic monsters, and more await them beyond the next horizon. This adventure is commendable not only for its ""Indiana Jones"" mentality, but also because it greatly expands the Known World of Mystara for future campaigns!"
3,Argh !,"I bought this CD because I like James Barbour's voice. I didn't see the show at the Tiffany, but the synopsis inside the CD sounds like a born failure: we're supposed to sympathise with 4 guys, most of whom are married or in committed relationships, who apparently sleep with the SAME prostitute on the SAME night. That's just nasty! They lost me right there.As for the music - it's okay. Not great, but not awful. The recording quality, as has been mentioned before, is poor. Mr. Barbour was in fine voice on the night of the recording, which just makes me want to bash my head against the wall because I could learn to like a lot of these songs, even the ones he's not included in, if I could hear them."
3,An interesting Idea...,"Well, the concept behind The Gift, was to mix acoustic pop music with musical theatre, and create a big success. In my opinion it didn't work... This show makes a better CD to listen to out of context. The music is good, but I could in no way put the story together if it weren't for the synopsis in the liner notes. I'm assuming there is a lot of dialogue in the show that is not recorded. The story as I understood it, was very much like the movie Very Bad Things, but a little more complex and less grotesque content. Five friends go through college together. Everyone has a dirty secret, but no one is telling. Life goes on they all get together again later in life, there's a hooker (played by Alicia Witt(Gertrude Lang from Mr. Holland's Opus))she dies, they panic... they eventually tell their dirty secrets and realize their friendship is still there, and the ""Gift"" is the unending friendship they all have together."
4,Really a gift...,"When I first sat down to listen to The Gift I was surprised by the *rock* sound of the music, but the simple message that each day is a gift to be treasured really touched my heart. The CD arrived shortly after the sudden passing of a dear friend and I found the music reinforced the message that life is precious and what is right here in front of us is often what we've been searching for. Initially I wasn't excited about the story, but it's grown on me and I've learned a lot from it -- including the fact that the real gift is just having those you love around you."
4,Cold journey,A very intresting book regarding a extraordinary journey. A travelers tale of a difference.
5,Faith Movie,"I like to collect movies about faith for a reason, to learn and understand the life of Christian people and wanted to understand it better. And this movie is mainly abut time of create of let me put it that way, Universe. Bible say it was create in 7 days, and Science say it created in billions of year, how was it be measurable of time? That is part of movie. Others are relationship of a hockey boy and Christian girl."
3,"Long on drama, short on facts","A thought provoking and interesting correlation between the scientific and biblical view of creation. Namely, the possibility that the views are the same by interpretating God and man's view of time units as different, but utterly fails to correlate beyond the rationalization that the views MAY be the same with any substantial proof that they ARE the same."
4,Good family movie,"The movie attempts to provide an explanation of how Biblical creation can co-exist with science without contradiction. In this it is fairly successful, though young earth creationists will not appreciate it. The movie has very good character development and has great examples of moral young people maintaining their Christian values in the mostly secular and heathen school environment in which most young people are forced to mature. My one criticism would be that in pulling everything together at the end, it could have been done in a bit more exciting an awe struck way instead of becoming a bit silly. Overall, a great movie and I highly recommend it."
5,an outside the box idea,"presented a new outside-the-box idea. showed some respectful tolerance amidst real-life conflicts, and that everyone should have their views tolerated. we all have the right to maintain our own ideas, our own views. great character tensions and resolutions. educational and entertaining. and with a happy ending."
5,Long overdo,Very absorbing tale. Well thought out story line. I thought the actors were very credible in their portrayals and the overall thesis hit a home run in my book.
2,a bit off...,"Has some great actors (Ernest Borgnine and Fred Dalton Thompson), but unfortunately some unBiblical theology.For a clear take on how this film departs from actual Genesis theology, see the review from Answers in Genesis."
1,They Spammed Me about this trash,More trash on why science is wrong and education discriminates against people with preconceived ideas about creation. A movie that days the world hates Christians because they push their obnoxious worldview.
1,Theistic evolution,My wife and I watched as much of this video as we could stand. It it loaded with theistic evolution with man being a by product of the big bang and over 16 billion years.It does not stand the Biblical record and I heartily DO NOT recommend it.
1,This is an awkward production,I expected a quality film with a clear message.This is not the case in my opinion.The thread of continuity was fuzzy and there was an air of moving too fast near the end.Big disappointment for me!
4,"After the Evangelical ""Attack Christian"" stuff.",The rest of it was pretty good. The time compression theory is interesting and I think might have some merrit.
4,like alot,i like this product havent watched the dvd yet because i saw it before but was very pleased with shipping it came on time. i would recommend everyone purchase this movie.
4,"Title concept seems more sub-plot, but overall movie's great","The GREAT part for me was in the Judeo-Christian family values always upheld here, with Kerry's heartfelt care for Truman in his pain. He didn't share her faith, but soon saw that her loving care was DRIVEN BY her quiet yet solid faith!(what a story, what a LESSON I'm praying many of my own fellow Christians will come to practice!!)I too thoroughly believe in creationism as Kerry and her family, so the above actually made the 'creation-evololution=coexistence' seem more of a sub-plot. My Christian landlord was excited about this part, though, and is already sharing this concept with many of his 'evolution-only' colleagues (you can correct me if I'm not saying that properly).This is a keeper, worth watching again and again."
1,SO UN~BIBLICAL!!,"worst movie EVER!! I have NO idea how others rated it so high!!! well, unless they don't actually READ their Bible!! It goes against scripture AND science to prove a point that is PURE FANTASY!!! The writers OBVIOUSLY don't REALLY know physics!!JEEPERS!"
4,6 thousand or 60 million?,"would recommend this video for anyone that has a curiosity about Genesis and the 7 day theory ofod creation. I will not say it is solid truth, only God knows that, but it is a great story."
3,Poor acting for the topic,Poor acting overall. The topic was interesting but the acting didn't match the potential of the subject.I would not buy the movie.
2,I am all for a good Christian show but this...,"I must put out there that I did not watch the whole movie. I watched most of it but just turned it off from sher exasperation. I was interested in this because I liked the main character who was in the Love Comes Softly series. I knew he could act and there were a lot of big names in this. The acting was my first problem with this movie. Even the people who knew how seemed to have trouble delivering their lines with enough feeling. But hey I knew what this movie was when I picked it up. I hung in there till the whole science explanation started and after about 30 min I got lost and bored and not just me my sister and my kids. So we fast forwarded and fast forwarded for a long while and just shut it off when there seemed to be no end in sight. I blame this movies faults on the editing staff. It would have been a much better, much shorter movie had they left a ton out."
2,Disappointing,"I had great expectations, but the movie fell short. Dr. Russell Humphreys has a much more plausible explanation of the universe using the Theory of Relativity."
4,A movie with broad appeal ...,"I saw this movie in the theater last year and enjoyed the entertaining combination of science, religon and personal relationships. It will appeal to people from high school age through adults. I plan on purchasing a copy for our DVD library and copies for my college age niece and nephew. I hope to see more movies from this production company!"
5,A spectacular tasting of Jimmy,"Jimmy Smith, the reigning B3 player of all time, was instrumental in ushering in the soul-jazz genre. These cuts show off his talents and the talents of his formidable sidemen. Mostly cuts from 56-60, with one from the 80's, they include some of his best solo work and his blazing speed. The Sermon and Back at the Chicken Shack and The Champ all show why Jimmy Smith reigns supreme and proves that his work influenced much of the music of the 60s and 70s. The end of The Champ could be confused as an Emerson, Lake and Palmer cut! If you've never heard Jimmy Smith before, this is the perfect album to get into his music."
5,Orange Pips Prove Fatal In This Entertaining Sherlock Tale,"1945's ""The House Of Fear"" is the 10th (of 14) Sherlock Holmes mysteries starring the inimitable duo of Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Dr. John H. Watson.This old-dark-house adventure features Holmes & Watson investigating the mysterious deaths of several members of ""The Good Comrades Club"".Despite some obvious plot holes (such as the unusually high number of old geezers who would have to be dropping dead right and left in this small hamlet town in order for enough corpses to be available for the perpetrators' use) this is one of my favorite Rathbone Sherlock entries. But, to be completely fair to the plotters of this story's crime, perhaps (unlike Watson's interpretation of the events) these body snatchers were going out of town to dig up a few.Another fun Holmes outing. Recommended highly, along with all of the other 13 Basil/Nigel teamings."
3,The Old Dark Holmes,"Partly based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's ""The Five Orange Pips,"" Universal's eighth Sherlock Holmes entry does not rank among the best. Nevertheless, the Basil Rathbone-Nigel Bruce chemistry and Roy William Neill's atmospheric direction make ""The House of Fear"" (1945) a reasonably diverting mystery. The 69-minute programmer would have fared better without Dennis Hoey's contrived appearance as the dim-witted Inspector Lestrade. Universal horror buffs will enjoy seeing the ""Frankenstein"" sets put to good use."
4,Good Player -- but intermittantly goes to B/W!,"I Like the player, and yes it is as region free as they say. However, the player will intermittantly loose all color in the picture and go to black and white. The only way to get the color back is to ""cold boot"" (turn off the player and turn back on) the entire unit. Heat, time nor region seem to be factors in this intermittant problem. Happens about once a week when played for 2-6 hrs a day but has occured after being off for days and when on for 5 min...even sometimes happens repeatedly in the same day or immediately after cold-booting...Why do I still like it? The price and multi use!!"
5,Sakura Stratosphere Dinnerware Set for 8,The dinnerware set arrived quickly and extremely well-packed. No breakage.It is beautiful and quite different from the usual white-china patternsin that it has a tri-corner shape. It is light and easy to handle.Many friends have admired it.
1,Poor Quality Finish - Made in China,"I received these plates yesterday. I was quite disappointed with the quality of the finish. Specifically - bubbling and pitting of the enamel was evident on over half of the plates. The ones I received literally look like something you'd find at a Dollar Store. The worst part now is having to repack all 53 pieces, and carry the 50 pound box back to the post office to ship back to Amazon. An absolute waste of my time."
4,casual dinnerware,product packed very well. package looked like it had fallen of the track but nothing was broken. there is a desing on the pices which is hardly visible on pictures (i did not expected it!) but i still like it. i can't wait to use it. and one more thing is not light its quite heavy stonware.
1,THE WORST PURCHASE ON AMAZON!,"I ordered two sets of this dinnerware and they arrived BROKEN. You would think they would package it well so the buyer could use what they purchased. I immediately went to Amazon's site and requested it be returned. UPS would only pick up one box and the other box is still sitting in my garage. I have contacted Amazon numerous times, one operator even gave me a UPS tracking number for the second box to be picked up and I still haven't received a call from UPS or had the box picked or received credit. Used my $25.00 reward certificate which was completely wasted. I have work and family and it is extremely tedious to contact Amazon every single day. I have been a LONG time Amazon customer but this is forcing me to look elsewhere to make my online purchases."
2,Not enough Bang for Your Buck,"It looks nice and does an okay job of protecting your Palm, but it's pretty bulky, and doesn't have enough pockets in the sleeve."
2,kids did not enjoy it!,"My kids, daughter 8 & son 5, both Power Ranger & video game fanatics, did not like the PR Time Force game! They have the PR Light Speed Rescue, which is the first play station PR game, which they loved. They were able to fight as a team, two players against the villains. This one does not allow you to play together but against each other. Two players can fight each other as Zords, they say that's boring! They liked it for maybe 5 minutes, that's it. The whole idea is to fight bad guys right? It's even better having another PR to help. They'll play it alone but very seldom. They game itself, I thought it was pretty good, challenging and it had good graphics. But again, I think they should have included a two player game fighting against the bad guys instead of just a single player game"
5,super awsome!,"I bought this game the first day it came out,i was so excited when i got home and popped it in,this is what i thought of it- super cool!I am 18 and this game was action even enough for me. I recommend this game to my age group because the power rangers are still cool and they fight crime in a good lessoned way.Go go power rangers!"
1,Magic Scams,"Every time I think these two individuals--I cannot bring myself to call them ""authors""--can't sink any lower, they prove me wrong. After denouncing magic and other occult practices for years, Gill and Oester now claim it is possible to protect oneself against terrorist attacks--you guessed it--through the use of ""magic""! These two charlatans have always preyed on the gullible, but exploiting the 9/11 attacks for monetary gain is unconscionable.Of course, ""Magic Dimensions,"" like everything else written by Gill and Oester, is full of factual and grammatical errors. People who write books should take a course in English grammar or, at the very least, pay an editor/proofreader to read and edit a proposed book before publishing it."
5,Excellent Book,Dr. Dave Oester and Dr. Sharon Gill are two of my favorite authors of such books. They know what they are talking about. I have learned much from this book.
3,"great looks, so-so comfort","Shoe looks great and is made out of real soft leather. I have the espresso color and it goes with most of my clothes (jeans, skirts) It has non-skid soles which is great since the heels are dangerously high. The inner sole is padded and covered with suede-like material, great for days when you're walking a lot. Not so great is the buckle-design on the straps. It rubs against your little toe when you move. It's not really that noticeable unless you've been wearing them for a while and you're prone to feet blisters which I am."
4,SEE THEM LIVE!,A new sound for TLD. I can only imagine where it goes from here. The most heart felt band in this genre of music. Its all about feelings and emotion. Finally had the chance to see these guys and they were amazing. They are also the nicest guys Ive ever met.
5,My New Favorite Band,A friend of mine when to Cornerstone Festival this past year and came back with this cd. I'm so glad he introduced me to this. I love that it has a dancy vide but yet still dark. Goth and industrial music has started becomming my favorite genres over metal bands. This is sorta a mix of both. WWW.Flamingfish.com carries lots of stuff simular to this. I recommmend their Automata mix cd's to get introduced to more stuff like this.
5,An excellent addition to a traditi,Eson's Haggadah is an excellent addition to this literary and religious tradition. He brings new insights and new explanations to this venerable literature. It is worth reading and using.
2,Better Off with the Original Edition...,"As with Donaldson's homage (or rewrite) of Rivello, the original Perry is far superior to the update by Azar. Perry's treatment of spanwise lift distribution alone is reason to pick up the 1950 edition versus Azar's stripped down clunker. I think the author was up against a page limitation, and simply tossed a few hundred pages."
1,Not the original!!!!!,"Do not buy the 1982 edition. The 1950s book buy Peery in a legend in aircraft structural analysis. The 1982 edition was stripped by Azar, and is not worth the money."
5,Never Too Far from another #1 hit!!!!!,"This new single is absolutely wonderful. In this single Mariah combines her recent hit Never Too Far with her #1 hit Hero to create a medely of the two!!! All the money from the sales of this single go to the September 11th Relief Fund!!! There for it is vital that we buy this single, especially if you are a Mariah fan! She has yet to have a #1 hit in the year 2001, but with thw sales of this single we can get her to #1!!! This Cd also includes a new un-realesed single THERE FOR ME. This song is really good and is defenately one of the best efforts from her since the album Daydream. It is a really good single and it is important to help those who were hurt by the attack on Sept. 11, so by buying it, you can do both....remember....that a hero lies in....you!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Beautiful songs with a Beautiful Message!,"For those who liked Mariah's ""old"" style of singing, you all with enjoy this single. The first track is a medley of ""Never too Far and Hero."" This track is a new rendition by Mariah herself. Her voice is very powerful on this track. The second track is ""There for Me,"" written by none other than Mariah and songwriter, Diane Warren (famous for songs like ""My Heart Will Go On"" or ""I Don't Wanna Miss a Thing"") I especially enjoy this track because Mariah's voice sound exceptionally like how she used to sing. One of my personal favorites, Mariah shouldn't have put this song on the B side of a single! It has great potential! Buy this CD, you won't regret it...and if you still need some convincing, the proceeds from the sales will go to the September 11th fund."
5,This Is What She Is Meant To Sing!!!,I was skeptical at first after I bought this single from a music shop. It was an import here though. But when I listened to it and I was definitely not disppointed from it. I loved the ballad There For Me. In fact it was the real star of the single in the first place anyway. It just moved me. I figgured. why can't she just keep singing songs and stuff like this? She usually so good and has done it for many years. What's more it was where she got her fame for anyway. This ballad reminded me of the Mariah Carey I knew in the old days when I actually started to go all crazy about her music and her voice. This single is a good recommendation if your sick of her latest scoop hip-hop songs that don't even suit her properly. Frankly Mariah please return to us the way you were before. Before we all put you to the shelves if you know what I mean. You were meant for this!!!!
5,Absolutely Beautiful!,"I heard the Never Too Far/Hero medley long before its release and I thought it was great. I also has a listen to the cd quality version of the b-side to this single, There For Me, which is an amazing Mariah song altogether. I highly recommend this for not only your average Mariah fan, but any Pop fan in need of a stocking-stuffer this holiday season!"
3,"Nice case, but shows wear fairly quickly...","I purchased this case when I purchased my green handspring. That was 1 1/2 months ago. The case is very pleasing to hold, feels good in your hand, and provides adequate protection to the all-important screen. But it shows any and all spots that might come to it, be it just the natural oils from your hands, or the lovely gooeys that 2 year olds can plop on it. Being of a nubuck suede, it is quite hard to clean without making the spot worse. Additionally, it does not provide any protection for the corners of the handspring on the side where the snap is. I am currently searching for a good looking zipper case."
3,As good as the movie. Pretty good,"I saw the movie and then picked up the cd and wondered,why don't they make movies like this anymore? Enough of slasher pictures and serial killers,have a movie that is old fashioned scary, no blood and gore,just slightly,quirky"
5,A Good Investment,"It's a great place to investigate Herbie's jazz work and see what you think. I'd recomend purchasing most of the albums that this is culled from too, but the better tracks from some of those records are encapsulated on here."
5,...music to head-hunt to...,"...i love this...i been puttin off gettin his classic stuff for awhile...why?no reason,i was jus bein' lazy that's all...yall know me...anyway, herbie is a genius and it is well represented with this collection! this is perfect for those of yall that love all (or even some) variants of jazz from fusion to downtempo..."
1,Doesn't work with my NEC ND-2100AD,"I have burned many DVDs of different brands without any problem in the past. But this new Memorex DVD+R 8x media does not work for me. Even though the media can be written without any reported error, a 60 minutes DVD movie play starts jittering after 30+ minutes on the same DVD-writer as well as my consumer dvd player. I have tried 3 disks with different movies and they all have this same problem. But the exact same DVD copies on my old Memorex DVD+RW 4x media have no such reading problem at all.I have also updated my DVD-writer to the latest firmware, but the reading problem still exists. So be sure your DVD drive can use this new media before you buy it."
5,this band is better live,"Low Flying Owls have been around for a few years. They are from Sacramento and have made some noise in the bay area. They have self-released a few CDs. Now they are about to get large. They are already getting known. They are much like the recent spate of cool guitar bands like BRMC and The Warlocks, and in a way they are doing their own thing. It's been an exciting year for Stinky Records. They have been able to bring the new rock to the people. What may be new and different about Low Flying Owls are their use of electronic sounds and their use of gritty urban imagery. Jared Southard is much like a William T. Vollmann hanging around the Tenderloin and writing about the street. These songs are like short stories about real life. They are a band that could make something happen in the next year. I have been hearing about the new rock revolution. Here it is, finally."
2,eh.,"i guess these guys just seem pretentious to me. all their songs are downers. i guess i'm not at a point in my life where i want to hear about other peoples problems through music. well, it's the fact they can't manage to do it in an artful/tasteful manner... that's the kicker."
2,not what one would hope for,"I heard the song Georgie Shot Johnnie (track 8) and fell in love. It is absolutely awesome. I rushed out and bought this album and I must tell you, it is NOT worthy. Insipid, generic, boring, lame. These are the words that these songs make me think of. It's hard to believe the same band that wrote track 8 wrote the rest of these songs. Listening to the rest of the songs started making me like track 8 less. Don't buy unless you like bad generock music.I gave it two stars because on amazon 1 star is the lowest I could give it, and Georgie Shot Johnnie makes it 1 star better than the worst you can give."
4,"Go, Johnny (go, go, go)","A really rich album from `66, this is the `99 re-issue from Japanese Blue Note/EMI/Toshiba. It is part of the ""mini-album sleeve"" series being redone by JBN, and features the original Andy Warhol artwork. classic! with sort of the same vibe as Rollins' Freedom Suite album. The title track is an real anthem. A bit pricey, but hey, it's an import."
1,THIS STUFF IS CRAP!,"This stuff should be RECALLED! ALL FOUR CATS ARE BARFING IT EVERY DAY,so we are returning it today!Do not give your cat this stuff, several sites say it's been ""discontinue"", but it's still on the shelves at stores!"
1,This pet food is disgusting,"Yep, that's exactly what I said. Byproducts, grain and diseased animal parts all in one ugly package. I've fed it to my family's cats, they didn't get hairballs but they lost a lot of fur and a pregnant mom cat we took in lost five out of six kittens when fed the formula. Iams makes horrible food; do your pets a favor and don't feed it! (Oh yeah and BTW we switched foods. The happy cats are now on Nature's Variety Instinct.)"
4,Comprehensive Collection,"This is a comprehensive collection of old Methodist hymns and also some of the more modern choruses. The binding is double spiral - this is good for laying flat or wrap-around. The page size is full size, but not overly large. The lyrics, notes, and chord symbols are large and readable. The chord symbol representations are quite good. They are probably in the middle between simple chords and full representation of all the note chord changes. The chord symbols have slash (/) bass note under some of the symbols. This is really necessary for doing hymns properly. I would say that if you are from Methodist or most protestant musical backgrounds this is almost a must-buy. If your background is Baptist, Evangelical Free Church, Bible Church a few of your favorite hymns might be missing."
2,A disappointment.,"This book would have been more helpful and credible had it been written by an objective person. Instead, it is written by someone who calls herself a ""loner"" (without ever defining what that is) and it reads like self-justification. There are no gradations in Ms. Rufus' book. You're either a ""loner"" or you're part of ""the mob."" There is a bitter tone in much of what she writes about nonloners. It's also filled with cliches (the Marlboro Man, Travis from Taxi Driver) that any of us who might think of ourselves as ""loners,"" or those more in need of solitude than the average Joe, would already be well aware of. A good idea for a book, but I was disappointed by the execution."
3,Lots of dry information,"I bought and read this book to feel some solidarity with other introverts who enjoy peace, quiet, nature, books, cooking for themselves, etc.While Ms. Rufus has a sense of humor, most of the book seemed dry as toast.If I was writing a thesis on loners I would have found this good material, but as a person who (ironically) wanted to connect with other solitude seekers I found it a disappointment."
1,absolute perspective,"This book is more of an individual's perspective on her own contempt towards herd mentality and by her examples, if a view is not shared with her, then it's with them. The absolute black and white of the beliefs aren't exactly a balanced view, but do express the author's intent in writing the book (however misleading the description, and title maybe.) The herd ironically does seem to enjoy this book."
1,Pity Party for Loners,"Just put my violin down long enough to write this review. Us vs. them thinking, contemptuous of differences, stereotypes, pejoratives, ridiculous conclusions and assumptions. This book presents an inaccurate unbalanced and very unkind perspective of the differences between introverts and extroverts. The author seems just a little too fond of her clever turning of a phrase and a belief in her specialness as a loner."
5,This Book Tells the Truth About Loners,"If you want to know what a loner really is, not the picture the crime reports on TV paint of them, read this book. I am a loner, and proud to say it. Party of One is extremely well-researched and written in a smooth, flowing style that anyone can follow."
3,just leave me alone,"I'm not an expert loner, but I do try hard. This book makes the loner feel less weird I suppose, but leaves a lot of unanswered questions. I was very much at ease with the writing style, and found the humor to be injected at just the right moments and in sufficient quantity to keep a smile on my face. I too am hoping for a follow-up work which addresses some of the specifics of paired loner homelife. I also feel the author tended to group all loners into one class, which bothers me a bit; I am a self proclaimed loner and love it, but there are some of us who are actually able to put down our loner screen and mingle with nonloners when necessary. The author seemed to suggest no pure loner would be capable of sinking to such a level. Perhaps there are several loner subspecies? hmmm....... Overall, quite a pleasure to read."
2,"A Defensive, Self-indulgent, Rambling Diatribe","I wanted to like this book, since my wife gave it to me as a present. While I strongly agree with the author's premise - that there is nothing unnatural and much to celebrate about being a ""loner"" - I struggle to find something good to say about the execution. The book seems poorly organized, resembling nothing so much as a long and rambling essay that is neither erudite nor particularly insightful. Infused with emotionally-laden terms like ""the mob"" the book seemed at times to be a rant based, obviously, on the author's own experiences. If she is herself a loner, and is proud of it, why the defensive tone that pervades this book?"
4,Party of One,Reading the ''Party of One'' by Anneli Rufus the book started off with the enaging and profound insight of the introvert and how the extrovert world perceives them ..This book dispels the myth that only loud and flamaboyant get ahead rather help introverts recognizes and capitializes their unique strength ..i am sure those who keep the company of self will enjoy this book tremendously
5,Must buy three copies,"Every 'loner' has to have three copies of this book (not in a Catcher in the Rye sorta way) so the next time someone in your family or friend asks ""why are you that way"" you can just lend him this book. Since loners get that question a lot, you will need the extra copies. I loved how Anneli showed how society has changed the loner from a revered pioneer, cowboy, or batman hero figure to the loner who shots up work places or schools. Never noticed it before but it does seem every news report about shooting involves a 'loner' who when you dig deeper is a outcast looking to fit in. Every aspect of lonerism is covered, and the whole Anchorism chapter was totally new to me. Great stuff!"
3,Could have been done in three chapters or so.,"The author makes very good points about the loners among us, but the entire thing could have been wrapped up in just a few chapters. One you get the main theme, which you do in the preface, the rest of the book is simply anecdote after anecdote. Which gets tiresome. I was hoping for something better. Two stars for content with an additional star for effort only."
1,"If you need a venting partner, this is for you.","If you feel pounded into the ground and overwhelmed by a world full of extroverts, and need the company of a fellow sufferer, this is the book for you. On the other hand, for a positive perspective on the art and joy of ""lonerism,"" I suggest ""The Introvert Advantage: How to Thrive in an Extrovert World."""
2,Disappointing,"More of a defensive, us vs. them rant than a thoughtful exploration of the pleasures of solitude. The author also fails to address the paradox of whether there can really be an ""us"" composed of people who are loners by choice."
2,One sided...,"Anneli Rufus has come up with about a thousand ways to tell you loners are the best thing since sliced bread. Its like having your mother compliment your new sweater over and over and over...very tiresome. She writes about ""loners"" in an absolute tense as if introverts, rebels, the anti-social, the socially inept and the quiet all lived the same life. Buy this book if you need a pat on the back. If you are looking for a deeper analyis, or something that inspires reflection, look elsewhere.Ill give her 2 stars for effort, study, and decent grammar."
1,trite,"This book is more a platform for Ms. Rufus's political views than a manifesto on solitude. She resorts to tired cliches rather than doing any useful research. As she sneers at popular culture, she illustrates how much she is popular culture. Perhaps the title should read ""one particular loner's manifesto"". I did not relate."
4,"Insight into ""Loners""","Party of One is a must read for anyone who knows someone who is a loner. It will help all better understand loners and why we do the things we do. The book covers a variety of issues from family, dating, friendships, marriage and true love, the workplace and other situations that loners and our actions are misunderstood. Although the reading gets tougher in the later chapters, i still recommemd the book to everyone."
2,Disappointed,"I had very high hopes for this book. I forced myself to finish it after reading the first chapter. Imagine a book written by an artist trying to describe the same mountain a scientist is trying to describe. The artist would write things such as vibrant flora, majestic soaring peaks, and serene tranquility. The scientist would describe it as: Mount Everest. Elevation: 8,848 meters above sea level. Located in the Himalaya Mountain range in Tibet. It is two people describing the same mountain from very different perspectives. This book is like an artist is trying to describe and explain Mount Everest to the world. Anybody looking for a more logical perspective should pass.It is probably a good read if you're an artist trying to explain yourself to the world. It is probably not a good read if you're a scientist trying to explain yourself to you. I know that's a sweeping generalization, but that's the basic premise of this book. An individual loner versus a sweepingly generalized mob."
2,Did a teenager write this?,"As a person that prefers to be alone, I thought this would be an interesting read. I was disappointed to find that it seemed to be written from the point of view of a teenager. A lot of talk about ""normal"" people and how ""annoying"" they are. I prefer to be alone over being with others, but that doesn't make me better than anyone else. I felt like this book was very divisive. I was disappointed."
4,Fascinating read that cuts across all kinds of topics,"Are loners truly violent, homicidal maniacs? Are loners the same as introverts and shy people? Rufus emphatically says ""No!"" By examining topics as varied as sex, religion, and popular culture from historical time to the present, she paints a picture of loners as mature, creative, and able to be in relationships (if they want to and find someone suitable).As a psychologist, I don't entirely agree with her that her definition of ""loner"" is different from ""introvert""; much of what she describes in the book is, in fact, characteristic of introverts. However, she is trying to regain control of a stigmatized label, and I can appreciate that. This book would help anyone to become more comfortable in their ""loner"" status (although it's perhaps a little more militant than Laney's ""The Introvert Advantage"") or to help others understand why their loner friends and family act in certain ways."
1,Keep Your Day Job,"The book, John K.Daniels, Young Boudicca, is not only poorly written, but unimaginative as well. He takes a look at the young warrior queen's life, by inserting supposed people and partial fact, which is fine for writing fiction. It isn't alright, in my opinion, to write as badly as he did and get published. I guess that makes me more angry at the publisher/editor than anything. The style goes from romantic to adventure to fantasy and descriptions of people become annoyingly repititious. For instance, Boudiccas historical husband, Chieftain Prasutagus, is referred to as ""fat Prasu"" not once or twice, but over fifty times in two chapters! Maybe he (Daniels) could find another adjective; I don't know. Since I am doing extensive research on the Life & Times of Boudicca, I thought this would be a helpful tool, but am terribly dissapointed. In my opinion, it is a supreme waste of money."
5,Great songs to chill out to!!!!!,"I can't believe what a great CD this is! Dark Course just sends me on a floating journey, I love this song! That's what I Get is another gem! The Jesus Song and Last Song, just having those soaring seventies leads that make you cream for more!!!"
4,this book is about the great depression,i thought the book was good. everyone seems to use it for report
1,The Author Is Biased and Unprofessional,"If you are looking for a book on the Great Depression with a left-leaning ideology, this is your book. If you are looking for an objective book on the Great Depression written by a scholarly, unbiased historian who allows you to make up your mind based on facts, THEN THIS IS NOT YOUR BOOK.The ideology of this author is plain to see to anyone. In this book, Progressives and their actions are described with admiration and god-like reverence. Conservatives and their actions are described with disdain and contempt.Finally, the author is unprofessional in his obsession to discredit Ronald Reagan in a book about the Great Depression. His pettiness is also evident in his attack of another author in the new introduction of this book. Thanks for pointing out Amity Shlaes' ""The Forgotten Man, A New History of the Great Depression,"" ISBN 9780066211701."
3,Historical Bias?,"The author uses the Depression of the 1930s as an opportunity to take potshots at Ronald Reagan (who was a teenager at the time). Although I don't know much about the era (hence my motivation for reading the book), it made me somewhat suspicious of the author's explanations for the [conservative] causes of the Depression - and its [progressive] cure. I wanted to read an objective history, but instead wound up with something that sounded more like an editorial."
2,Biased Reagan bashing,"If the author of a book on the Great Depression mentions what he believes to be the problems of a President's economic policies 50 years later than the topic at hand, that's O.K. I'll give him the right to say what he believes...If the author does it twice in the same book, that is really more than necessary and I get the point already.If the author does it three times, I start to sense a problem.This author did this at least four times by my count. I read the entire book several years ago and the only thing I remember from the book these years later was how Ronald Reagan was mentioned in a negative light four times."
3,So-so,"Although the individual interviews and stories were interesting, the choice of stories and the order of the presentation is a bit perplexing. The project seems to lack cohesion."
1,Could hardly be worse,Just awful. So bad that I felt compelled to write this (my first ever Amazon review).This book reads like a transcript of a sophomoric lecture about the Great Depression. One star because there is no option for zero.
3,Biased book but worth a read,"The definitive book on the Great Depression (GD) of the US has not been written yet. If it were, you would see facts such as: the GD was not as severe in term of lost output over one or two years as other past depressions in the US, what the GD exceeded in was unemployment over a long period of time (> 2 yrs); how the Fed. Reserve contributed to the GD; how the ""market crash"" of 1929 actually started out as a routine stock market correction but was made worse by the Fed Reserve; how the make-work policies of Roosevelt as aided by Keynes failed to stimulate the economy out of depression; how the GD was used as a cover to make the US economy more socialist (perhaps a necessary evil in view of the worldwide popularity of communism at the time). And so forth.BTW I have not read this book."
4,Good Stuff,"I couldn't disagree more with the reviewer who stated the comparison between Alan Parsons Project and Royksopp. Trust me if you like Melody A.M. you will like this album. Royksopp has let loose on this album and expanded as well as defined their music into more actual songs.Highlights for me are Sombre Detune, Triumphant, What Else is There?, and Alpha Male.49% is perhaps the low point of the album, but over repeated listens, on a good system, it reveals very subtle layers. Royksopp has taken ful advantage of the studio this time in the best sense. The songs feel more fleshed out, more thought out, and overall more developed.At the very least it will leave your head nodding with a grin on your face."
3,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"After adoring Melody A.M for so long, I received a Promo CD of the Understanding and what can I say? After listening to it for quite sometime now I am somewhat, dissapointed, where is Erlend Oye's lovable voice from ""Remind Me"" and ""Poor Leno"" ? (IF you want to hear a great track with his vocals definitely listen to Phonique - For the time being) Some of the tracks on the cd are fine, but then there are some that are too nordic-pop almost to the point that you can imagine nsync or the abba-teens dancing to it. I dont know, I waited for so long for another Royksopp production and I cant say that Im satisfied with this one. If you like A-Ha and/or Abba , you should like this cd."
1,Nothing big in here...,"What do you call an album that is supposed to be trance or chill-out music but is filled with extended pop songs?Yes, you guessed right! An overhyped album and one certainly not to waste your time on.Only ""Only this moment"" seemed to catch my ear. ""Dead to the world"" is certainly no trance and listenable if you like to just play some soft music while watching the sun go down or gaze at the stars. ""What else is there?"" sounds as if Cyndi Lauper just made a comeback.An extremely poor follow up to their debut ""Melody A.M"" which had more acceptable material."
1,Eech,"Röyksopp have jumped from an ambient electronica groove to a shinier, cleaner place. The manikins wear stylishly dark clothing and are vaguely threatening, but it's ultimately vapid and pointless. This is the sort of album that you would expect a band to have put out in their early years, before they developed their own sound. It would be forgiveable if this were an old album! With The Understanding, Röyksopp have abandoned their t-shirts and headshop paraphrenalia -- they listened to the record execs too much, and ended up as the soundtrack to an ""edgy"" department store display. By all means, skip it!"
2,"A few awsome tracks, mostly typical 10 year old club techno","sounds pretty lame for the most part. Some tracks are amazing! While most of them sound like the crap you hear at most urban teen and college clubs. I guess if all you got going for you is your hips and your gay ass pink furry hat, then so be it.I'll settle for some cEvin Key or Public Enemy over this any day."
1,COPY CONTROLLED,THIS CD IS COPY CONTROLLED! COPY CONTROLLED MUSIC IS A VIOLATION OF PRIVACY AND RIGHTS. DON'T SUPPORT ARTISTS THAT SUPPORT THIS!
2,mmmm.... Karin Dreijer ...... the only good thing!,"Karin Dreijer is ""F"" INcredible..she is AMAZING elsingle ""what else is there"" Es lo mejor del album, Te hace creer que el album entero tendra ese electronico oscro con letras magnificas, si hubiera cantado el album entero hubiera sido magnifico,... pero no se ve realemnte un esfuerzo, como dice una critica esta en el borde de lo bueno y lo malo..."
1,I just cannot get into it.,"When I first listened to this album, I just thought it was awful. I didn't know if I truly found it awful, or if I didn't like it because Royksopp was taking a new direction, and it wasn't what I was expecting.I listened to this album a few more times, and really tried to get into it. I just can't. It's mundane dance pop. The music sounds like background music at the gap or old navy.I can't even enjoy Melody anymore, because I get depressed about what they became. Same reason my Liz Phair CDs have been collecting dust. Only This Moment is an ok song, but I really only enjoy the vocal. The song feels more like a guilty pleasure, rather than a compelling song."
1,A huge disappointment!,"After their amazing debut in 2001, ""Melody AM,"" Norwegian prod duo Royksopp ""sell out"" by producing ""The Understanding;"" an aimless exploration of Euro-pop with not one iota the class and sophistication of their seminal work. I waited four years for their second release, only to be terribly disappointed. The creative muse has obviously left Torbjrn Brundtland and Svein Berge, only to be replaced by vapid trendiness in their quest for wider appeal. I have never been so let down by a follow-up record as I am by The Understanding. I want my money back!!"
1,Not pysched....at all.,"Sigh. I'm so disappointed. I first found Melody AM in Paris, January 2002. Digging it so much, I've listened to it consistently since then. I even bought it again after my first copy got scratched. It never gets old. But this, ugh. I was waiting for this for years! I even had amazon next day it to me when it came out. Sadly, I'm disappointed. It's like generic euro-pop. None of the mojo of Melody AM. And....this is the first amazon review I've ever done. I'm that blue...............Selah."
1,The MISunderstanding,"What happened?I thought ""Melody AM"" was an absolutely brilliant album- with its unexpected combinations of spacey bleeps and bloops, smooth vocals, and chilled out beats. These songs would start out as one thing and evolve into something new in a way that I can describe as nothing but genius.The greatest weakness of ""The Understanding"" is thatwhere ""Melody AM""'s songs changed and expanded to become something fresh and new through each track, ""The Understanding""'s melodies and vocals remain the same (through each song). Truly, what you hear on Amazon IS what you get. If you are able to do so, listen to the whole album before you decide to buy it.In short, this album is fast to become monotonous and boring- it is 180 degrees from Melody AM."
3,The One That Got Away,"THE UNDERSTANDING is that their first brilliant album, MELODY AM, was a fluke. Either that, or they weren't able to grasp what made MELODY AM brilliant. Hopefully they will work it out before releasing their next albumn. (tip: less voice, its not your strong point)"
2,I can't Understand...,"...how I loved every track on Melody A.M., and I struggle to find anything to like on Royksopp's extremely disappointing follow-up. Don't give me any pretentious excuses like ""they're evolving"". If they are, they abandonded what worked on Melody, and are now going in a more pop-like (and in my opinion) WRONG direction.Yes, I have listened to the album several times, and TRIED to give it a chance. There are a few good tracks that are reminiscent of Melody: Someone Like Me, Clean Sweep, and Triumphant.. they're ""ok"". On the other tracks, there are a lot of weak vocals that wreck the songs.Word to the wise: If you liked Melody AM and want to keep your positive impression of Royksopp, don't bother with The Understanding."
2,Extremely disappointing.,"I found Melody AM to be one of the most creative and impressive debut albums of the past few years. Royksopp's new release is nothing more than a typical europop album, along the lines of Frost, etc. While it features 2-3 catchy numbers, I find it to be a very cheesy and trite album in general. I'd highly recommend sampling a few numbers from the web before buying this one if you were a fan of Melody AM. Let's hope that they make some money off of this release then get back to being creative."
5,An excellent book that completely changed the way I see the role of money in our society,"Deeply rooted in history, this highly fascinating book traced the evolution of our current money system back from the days of commodity currencies in ancient civilizations, to the birth of coins in Lydia and to the electronic currency in today's modern world. Along the way, the author describes very vividly the way each society throughout history utilized their form of medium of exchange, giving a complete set of perspectives on people's relationship and attitude with money.Which raise a premature issue, will today's currency such as dollar and yen will soon join in the scrap box of history among ancient currencies such as cowrie shells, salt, guinea, and ducat?"
3,"An enjoyable, light read on monetary history","I wish I could give it 3.5 stars.It's a light read. The author summarizes a lot of history and gives you his opinion. It's not a heavy-duty study of economic history, but great for reading at the beach or on a flight."
3,Enjoyable,"A very interesting overview of money and currency from a historical and anthropological perspective. The book's only flaw is the author's advocacy of out-dated mercantilistic theories regarding the gold standard. However, I certainly agree with his premise that the socialization of risk has led to the increased inflation of housing and financial assets."
5,Absolutely Fantastic,"Weatherford goes over the history of money in a way that does not bog down in too much detail, and provides an overview of a full spectrum of money's transformation over its history in a way that is both readable and interesting. I found it to be deeply insightful on what money is, and how it works. I would recommend it to anyone, whether laymen or people knowledgeable on money and related subjects.Absolutely fantastic."
2,I struggled my way thru this one,"I guess I only finished it becuase I always finish a book I start reading (especially if I paid for it).It was so hard to read, the style is tiring, resembling a ranting inner dialogue more than a book on an economic category, even iof it is from a cultural and anthropological perspective!At the end of the day I can say I know what Aztecs used for money (and how they tortured children to death as children's tears were considered some sort of ""rain magic"". damn, I REALLY DIDN'T WANT TO KNOW THAT!!!) and that coins were invented by Lydians (and a number of simiral pieces of information) but I also have a HEADACHE and am feeling frustrated and nauseated and extremely unhappy.I don't think that is how you are supposed to feel after reading a book on history of money! I don't feel informed or enlightened at all.Having read other people's reviews I guess accuracy of information presented (unless it refers to social or cultural aspects of money) might also be problematic?!"
1,Some facts seem questionable,"I gave this book a try because I am interested in learning how the banking system works from a historical perspective.In short, some basic facts do not agree with what I have read previously.The most striking example that I remember is Weaterford's assertion that money is printed and spent by the ""government"" for ""government projects"", thereby causing an ever increasing money supply and financial problems that will inevitably explode.This is not in agreement with the vast majority of explanations on the central bank and money supply that I have read.I'm writing this as a layman to encourage everyone to read this book carefully."
2,So many mistaken facts,"This is definitely a difficult book to review. On the one hand, the writing is good and the material is interesting and well-handled. The problem is that the book is riddled with errors, many of them blatant, so it's impossible to come away being sure of anything you have read. When the author cannot bother to check simple facts like what sea is between Greece and Turkey (it's not the Ionian), or who was the first Democratic President after the Civil War (it wasn't Woodrow Wilson), how much faith can you put in his statements about the forces that gave rise to Florentine banking or the Free Silver movement?I have never read a book with so many stupid mistakes. On the other hand, I read it cover to cover, and I don't bother finishing books I dislike.Mainly, I'm just disappointed that a good writer with interesting material could produce so unsatisfying a book."
3,"Once again, shaky history","As many other reviewers noted, his history is shaky. Not only that, his anthropological knowledge and understanding of social fabric of many of the societies he reviewed are also weak. It seems that Mr. Weatherford wrote his book without always checking his sources, as if 'out of his head'. My personal favorite flop was his continuous insistence that Lydia was a country located by IONIAN sea. Has he checked his map? Ionian sea is on the other side of Greece and, naturally, modern Turkey in the region where Lydia was located has access to Aegean and Mediterranean seas. I am a little upset with writers who undertake to write sprawling historical analyses without having a solid historical base. He would have gotten a C- in my class. Still his style is entertaining and once you get used to inaccuracies and are willing to overlook them, then it could be an enjoyable read."
3,Leave this one for the book collectors,"""Selections from Adventures in Time and Space"" is a paperback book of short stories selected from a much larger book. There are 8 short stories included. #1 is ""Requium"" by Robert A' Heinlein, about the fulfillment of D.D. Harriman's dream to fly to the moon. (Harriman was ""The Man Who Sold the Moon"". This story is easily available elsewhere.#2 is ""Black Destroyer"" by A. E. Van Vogt. Coeurl, the Black Destroyer, is frustrated and destroyed. Very dated attitudes are apparent.#3 is ""Time Locker"" by Lrwis Padgett. A crime in time, still doesn't pay.#4 is ""Mechanical Mice"" by Maurice Hugi. Man vs robot.#5 is ""Asever was"" by P. S. Miller. Time travel can be confusing.#6 is Quietus"" by Ross Rocklynne. Oops!#7 is Robot""s Return"" by Robert Williams. Mankind has passed.What of his heirs?#8 is ""FareWll to the Master"" by Harry Bates. Who is the Master?The stories are decent, but the book is expensive. It is probably best left for the book collectors."
1,Never worked out of the box,"I bought this dvd up-conversion to go with my new Lns4692d lcd. After hooking it up via hdmi cable, the screen was so distorted, movies were unrecognizable. O.k. obviously the hdmi-out on the dvd player was faulty. With this being said, the remote response was extremely slow, had to press a couple of times for a response, overall this samsung product is very cheaply made. Your paying for the included Hdmi cable. Went out and bought the Sony dvp-ns75h, awesome quality.......order the hdmi cable on line, 25$. You will still be saving about 30$."
2,Good quality picture BUT bad quliaty product,"I was excited when I got my HD960, I had to wait after christmas because every site had it backordered. When I got my ordered after a great deal of confussion on the day it was shipped, I ripped the box apart since I wanted to start using it right away. And then and there all the problems began. It played the first DVD wo a problem. BUt then the 2nd DVD, it froze several times and skipped scenes. OK, I figure must it been the DVD. Tries another one, played fine for about 30 mins and then it crapped out on me!! OK, I told myself I shall give it some time to ""rest"", left the DVD player alone after that and decided to wait until the next day. Parapum! I crapped out on me, ONCE MORE!! By then I figure it could not be the DVD then I decided to give it a couple of other tries but some plays were worst than others. So here I am waiting on the UPS guy to pick this POS!! I think I had too many expectations, dont thin I'll buy another SAMSUNG prod again..."
4,Very nice DVD player,"Even though I can't really tell a difference on standard DVD's, when set to 1080p output from this dvd player, versus it's 720p and 1080i output. I'm running it on the Samsung 61in DLP, which is also doign 1080p upconversion.The real difference is between actual HD content broadcast through my Comcast DVR box, versus watching regular DVD content :("
4,Good Player,"Bought this after reading multiple reviews, It is a very nice player with good picture quality. Features are easy to navigate and the remote is user friendly. Happy with purchase."
3,"Good DVD player, but...","This is a good DVD player (good picture, and low-profile), however, like the other reviews say...it is V-E-R-Y...S-L-O-W. I bought this DVD player because it was one of the first ""non-HD"" players with 1080i & HDMI outputs. It takes way too long to load up the disc once you put it in. Also, the menus are very sluggish, and not very intuitive at all. I would rate this specific DVD player ""AVERAGE"" at best. I would definitely consider other ones first...do your research, and then come back to this one if you don't like anything else.Samsung DVD-HD960 Up-Converting DVD Player"
5,Great buy,"This dvd player most obvious differance is the upconversion process,on new movies the process is still effective but not as obvious as when watching movies produced before HD came along. Watching movies filmed prior to approximately 10 years ago the improvement is very noticeable. Watch the movie ""Zulu""and you can see the difference.Well worth the cost over a normal progressive scan DVD player."
3,Not a multiformat dvd player,I put the vcd disc in and it won't support it.I also tried with a dvd disc with avi files. They work but slow as hell when it first started. I think the LG one is much faster...Not so impressive but it looks so good and I plan on buying the HK amp so they will match perfectly... so not sure if I want to return it or not..
3,Others are right --- don't get too excited,"This is a decent little DVD player. I bought it a few days ago. It plays everything I own and performs quite well. But I get the sense that people are thinking these ""upconverting"" DVD players are some sort of magic answer that make old DVDs look like High Def. Don't fall for that---you'll be disappointed. I have a new Samsung 56"" DLP 1080P TV, and I have this unit hooked up directly through the HDMI port. The picture and sound are great, don't get me wrong. But they are still clearly NOT high def. They look like very clear, normal, DVD signals. Any over-the-air network broadcasting a football game in 720p is going to be a much, much clearer, HD signal. So yes, I recommend this unit, as long as you aren't expecting ""magic."" Buy this product and use it until the HD DVD vs. Blu-ray war is over."
5,I've bought three of them,"I use 1080P Samsung TV's so I bought one of these because I knew it would work well with the same brand TV and the remotes can work both devices when necessary. The picture quality is great, on par with HDTV and the setup and functions are simple and do everything I need. For the price, I decided to get two more and wait until the HDDVD wars are over before I think about upgrading to an HD DVD player if ever. I've been very happy with the product."
2,Does not really upconvert,"I did not find any difference between my old standard DVD player and this one. they are both connected to my new Samsung 61"" 1080P TV."
3,A player is a player?,"I was in need of a new DVD player and read a lot of the reviews on line. This unit was to be one of the better units out there but when I placed the up-converting DVD plaver in line using the required HDMI cable to my HD television I have to say the picture was not any better then the $40.00 DVD plaver I was using in the past. One review stated that a HD television upgades automatically a DVD signal. Beyond that, the unit plays all of my DVD's I own."
1,buyer beware,"I bought the Samsung DVD-HD960 a short six weeks ago, and it is already broken despite careful and limited use. Samsung's reaction? They could not care less that their product went from questionable performance to worthless in six weeks; they just say to mail it to a California location, at my own expense, where it will allegedly be repaired in an unspecified time. This is their full-warranty service. I wonder if, after repair, the unit will be up to its original inferior standards. Be very careful dealing with Samsung; their interest in the customer ends after the sale is completed."
5,Biggest bang for your buck!,"It performs great, looks good, already set up to work w/ Samsung LNS3251D LCD TV remote, comes w/ an HDMI cable, and a fraction of the cost of Blue Ray and/or HD DVD players. No issues with this unit so far, and have been using it for about 1.5 months. You get the ""Biggest bang for your buck!"""
4,Samsung DVD-HD960,"The unit has performed beyond my initial expectations. The picture quality rivals my current digital HD channels. Until the HD/Blu-Ray format battles end, I would highly recommend consideration of this unit by individuals looking to get the most out of their current DVD collections"
2,Player Freezes and Skips,"I looked hard for a player that upconverts to 1080P to match my new television and was excited to find this one. My intention was to use it until the HD format war is settled and the prices fall. However, I have been disappointed with this player and regret my purchase. While the picture quality is excellent, it has a tendancy to freeze at random for several seconds before resuming play and will occasionally skip over portions of the DVD. If I had to do it again, I would have selected another player even if it only upconverted to 1080i."
2,"Trouble with Burned CDs, Unimpressive Upconverting","I didn't realize how important it was that my DVD player music well until I purchased this unit: half of my CD collection is CD-Rs, and whenever I put a CD-R in this player, I got a second of silence for every 10 to 20 seconds of music. I called Samsung, and they told me that the unit was defective; however, I don't think I'll take my chances on trying another unit. The upconverting to 1080i, incidentally, was virtually imperceptible until I brought my eyes to within about three or four inches of the screen. Finally, the build quality of this unit is not impressive and borders on cheap, and the halting tray movement indicates poor design. I'm not sure that I am ready to give up on upconverting quite yet, but I do know that I need to purchase a more robust and reliable player."
1,I wish I could recommend this player.,"First, if you do buy this, do not buy it from Amazon, as it seems they have a faulty shipment.I ordered one for use on a 1080i CRT. LOVED the picture, best DVD player ever (with exception of the slow but livable controls). Then, the picture began switching back and forth with a light blue hue. Most notible in BW movies, but also in color movies. So I send it back to amazon.Second one comes, EVEN WORSE! The screen wallpaper is all ""jumbled"" for lack of a better word. Once the movies began playing, there were yellow artifacts all over the screen.I wish I could recommend this, but I just can't. In fact after the second one, Amazon acknowledged there were above-average return rates on this item. They said they'd be giving me a refund and some money for my trouble. Why they're still selling it is anyone's guess."
5,"Very Good Picture, Great Price","This DVD player is very nice. I have it hoooked up to my Samsung LCD HDTV via the included HDMI cable. The picture isn't quite as good as Blu-Ray or HD-DVD, but it is well worth the price. Regular DVD's look very crisp. If you have the money to spend, get a Blu-Ray or HD-DVD, but if price is a problem get this HD-960. If you play a lot of video games, just fork out the cash and get the $599 Playstation 3 that has a Blu-Ray disc player."
1,never worked!,"This product came highly recommended by our AV guy who was putting together our media room. We purchased it (not through him) and he got it all installed and looked like everything was going well. About 20 minutes into playing the first DVD it ""skipped"". It dropped sound and picture for about 2 or 3 frames. At first we thought it was having a problem upscaling the dvd...but even at native resolution it continued. We contacted Samsung and were told we had to ship it to the service center in California. I talked to another AV guy who said they had an office FULL of these players that have quit working or have this skipping problem. Looks like we'll be buying the Toshiba to replace it!"
2,Blinking every 5 to 10 minutes,"I'm having the same exact problem as another reviewer here. I lose picture and sound for a split second. It's almost like a blink of an eye every 5 to 10 minutes troughout a movie. I thought I could live with it, but I can't. Now I am distracted while watching a movie because I'm waiting for the darn thing to blink again. I'm using the supplied HDMI cable routed through my receiver then out to HD monitor via another HDMI. I'm thinking of trying component cables. Anybody else have this problem??? I suppose the picture quality is good, but not much better than my old DVD player. I'm in the process of returning this unit."
2,Poor performance,The image quality is ok but not great. The most annoying problem is that it will go blank on DVDs and silent on both DVDs and CDs. This happens often and randomly during playback. It also loses the settings and has to be reprogrammed every day or so. I definitly would not purchase another Samsung product if this is the quality to be expected.
2,Glitchy,The video quality (720P & 1080i) is very good. Almost as good as the Oppo. But it is very sensitive with even a new DVD-R or DVD-R DL. Randomly pauses for 5 seconds. Samsung phone support is OK but forget their website for support.
3,Reciew from The DJ Sect,"After reviewing this recordign we here at the dj sect will give this three stars. we here feel that the transitions betwen songs is good but could be better, also their is the length of some songs (they could be shorter, more intence)"
1,Really Cheap,This is decorative but cheap. It comes with no instructions and personally my order had a broken piece. Buy it for the 2-7 age crowd. Otherwise it is not worth looking into.
1,only a child's set,"The image is misleading. this is a child's beginning set, suitable for someone between 3 and 9 years old. the brushes are about 1/3 the size of a normal chinese calligraphy brush. But then what would you expect for $12?"
2,Not good,"I really don't like. The price is really cheap, but it really worth ""every penny"". So be prepare what you pay is what you gonna get!"
2,Cheap,"This product was cheap and some of the parts broken upon receipt. Definitely Seemed to be mass produced, the brush handles are plastic, not wood and were cracked."
4,Chinese Calligraphy Set,"This item comes in a very nice case and has great presentation. It is perfect for a ""beginning"" calligraphy student. My 11 year old son loves his set and was very happy with the items included. If you are looking for something more advanced you would want something with a little finer brushes. I would buy this item again for a child."
3,Chinese calligraphy set,"This is a nice set to get started in Chinese calligraphy. While I enjoyed the novelty of grinding the ink, it didn't take long till I purchased a separate bottle of ink to get to painting quicker. I still haven't figured out how I am going to use the little spoon? :)"
1,Complete crap,"I just got this today. And i thought it was going to be great. But when i opened the box, one of the brushed were snapped in half, the stone stamp is just a block, and the spoon is crappy plastic."
5,Smooth & Flowing,I found this item very helpful in improving Chinese calligraphy. It is ideal for starters. I love the one I have and feel it has been a Godsend in improving calligraphy. It's like the thick pencils for beginner writers of Western languages. These brushes are on the thick end so beginners can get used to the proper way of holding them and writing with them. Excellent for any beginner.
5,AMAZING!,Everything in the kit is perfect! Its everything you need in there to use for chinese calligraphy! I <3 it! I know make lots of art with it!MUST HAVE!it is probably the best you can buy!
2,Guidelines for Nutrition Care of Renal Patients,"This book is not a typical reference to be recommended for dietitic practitioners who wishes to work in chronic dialysis setting. The contents of this book with the given guidelines were merely tables/formats from page to page and nothing else. It's like a body without a clothes on. It would have been helpful if they have provided examples from each guidelines for better application of the given flow charts, formats/tables, and expected outcomes. The supplememental section is not thorough in giving explanation and some acronyms such as FFM was not identified what it's stand for. A further improvement on this book is needed to better assists future dietitians who chooses to work in renal setting. I only bought this book hoping to find more in-depth information in the management of renal patients but what I got were only tables/formats and flowcharts."
2,Graduate Level Book,"I bought this book for a graduate level biochem class. However after spending a couple of months with this book I hardly use it. The diagrams and tables are excellent, but the way the text is written is horrible. Most of my biochem professors do not like the book for that reason (we use it here because one of our professors was an author). Some might tell you that because it is a graduate level text it is supposed to be hard to understand, that is hog wash. I don't recommend buying this book unless you have to, there are much better selections out there."
4,liberon paste wax,"the service was five stars, but the product, a wax product, does not harden fast enough so that the surface can be buffed. It's probably good on furniture but does not work that well on a table top."
4,Fever...,Ronnie Laws Fever is a good disc from a great musician. It's available at a good price these days. Get a copy and get familiar with Ronnie Laws...Fever. Four stars!!
5,Back in Form,"After the slightness of THE NAME OF THE WORLD, and the somewhat scattered ALREADY DEAD, Johnson returns to the form that made JESUS' SON such a classic in this collection of articles. The standout is hands-down the last piece on his f**cked-up experiences in Liberia. Also good are the glimpses you get into Johnson's personal life, including his marriage and subsequent honeymoon in the wilds of Alaska, where they try to pan for the gold from which they plan to fashion their wedding rings; the highly disorganized hippie festival he goes to; the bikers for Jesus; his short piece on his brief stint as a Boy Scout. If you're already a Johnson fan, SEEK is cause for celebration."
3,An OK shoe,Wasnt as impress as some with the fit of this shoe. I also wore it out faster then my ASICS... I average 20-25 miles a week on treadmill/ road. These babies were pretty torn apart in about 3 months. Every one has diffrent needs but I wasn't impress.
4,A must have for beginners,"This book is a big help, specially for those who are beginners in this hobby. Take special note of the aquarium suitability index which is quite accurate. I have bought several fish before which have died within a couple of days. Now I consult the book first before purchasing and so far all the fish are healthy and alive. The only drawback of this book is they could have added more fish species and made the book bigger in size. Otherwise it's a must have. Nice pictures too."
5,Start here!,"This book is a great start when trying to decide what marine fish to buy. It is handy to take with you to the fish store. There are certainly other great sources of more comprehensive & definitive information about specific fish, but anyone looking to buy saltwater fish should start here.The author, Scott W. Michael, is a renowned expert in this field. He has more than 25 years experience as an aquarist and diver. He has written several other books and contributes regularly to Aquarium Fish Magazine.Ron Shimek's Marine Invertebrates is finally available and is an excellent companion to this on. Also, Michael's Reef Fishes series offers a far more comprehensive coverage of fish for those who seek more."
4,Value for your aquarium dollar,"Interested in setting up a Fish Only Marine aquarium? Concerned about fish that will be compatible with the invertebrates in your Reef aquarium? Want to expand your knowledge beyond the 10 basic marine fish that your local aquarium store has in stock? Then this is a good book to consider. Loaded with full color pictures (on glossy paper)of marine fish, the book gives a concise summary of hundreds of these salt water inhabitants. The book itself is easier to handle than the smaller dimension Baensch Atlas and the print is larger. And the price is good value for your aquarium dollar. Bring this book with you to the aquarium store, and when you see that incredibly beautiful marine fish that you have never seen before, a quick read in this book will give you some of the information you will need to make an informed decision as to whether this fish will fare well in your aquarium at home."
3,Keep in mind it is a pocket guide.,"As long as you keep in mind that the book is under the PocketExpert Guide series then you will know what you are getting. The book does have over 500 + popular marine species but doesnt give more than very general information about each species. There are also some listings with no other information than it's photo, scientific name and its tank suitablity rank. In conclusion, its a good general book but I'll probably look for another fish book."
5,Excellent book!! We recommend,Excellent book for anyone interested in marine fish. Amateurs or professionals. The truth was very useful to know specifically each species.
5,A Must Reference,"This is the best fish reference I currently own. It has a great difficulty rating, minimum tank sizes, general animal sizes, and explains important behavioral, feeding, and compatibility issues. For the amount of information, the compact format and price are amazing. I have other volumes that are good for identifying fish due to many pictures, but this is where I recommend anyone who needs a fish reference start to figure out what you might want to stock, and help you in making purchases. Must have!"
3,cheap product,I'm also not happy with this costume for the same reason as the other reviewer. The picture is misleading regarding the hood. The mask is so small that no child with a head larger than a lightbulb would be able to use it. The costume is cheaply made and not what I thought I was buying.
3,Spiderman costume,I am not happy with this spider man costume. When I ordered it online it showed the full hooded mask for this size. I don't think my child is going to want to wear this beanie cap. He's three years old and he knows the difference.I may have to return this suit. Thanks Cindy Wilkinson
3,spiderman costume,"I was disappointed in the costume. The pisture on the site shows a full mask, but the one I received has just a face mask and a hat- It is deceiving!!!"
2,Wouldn't reccommend.,My son received this costume for his 4th birthday. It's absolutely not worth [...]. Very cheaply constructed and the mask doesn't fit properly. It also runs very small. My son wears a 3T and this costume sized 4-6 fit him perfectly. Look elswhere for a spiderman costume; it can't be worse than this one.
2,Cheap Spiderman Costume,"My 4 1/2 year old boy was so delighted when we ordered this Spiderman costume. I ordered it large as I thought they might run a bit small and I want him to wear it for a while. He is a 4T and I got the size 7-10. The 7-10 outfit barely fits him although it is extremely long in the arms and legs. The mask does not fit his head and barely fits his 2 year old brother. The crotch seam ripped out after 2 days of playing - only about 2 hours of wear each day and the cuffs are ""running"". I have not sent it back since he is upset that he would be without it. Purchase a costume from another company - you will be glad that you did."
3,Superman Fanatic - Falls Apart,"This costume was received as described and in a timely manner. But, after a few wears and some ""kick attacks"", the costume started to rip. Quality not the best, but my son still loves to wear it."
3,Runs a bit small,"I ordered this for my son, who was invited to a Superhearo party. He has been in a solid size 6 and sometimes goes up to a 7. I think this costume runs a bit small. It fit him perfectly but if he wore a 7, I think it would be too tight.The costume is of average durability. Parents used to ordering these types of costumes will find it average. If I had to wash this every week, it might not make it past 6 months.I didn't order any gloves to go with this, he wanted them but didn't need them. Unless it's a chilly Halloween night, save your $ and skip the gloves as well.Overall my son loves this costume. He's not a fan of the velcroe back. it bothers him, so we leave the back open, he's usually wearing a shirt underneath anyway.We were going to a party in the spring. The costume is quite warm. The material is thin but the overall effect left him overheated in the sun. Please keep this in mind if you're using the costume in a warmer climate.It is a good value for the price."
1,Do not waste your money,"My son LOVES Spiderman. I purchased this costume last week. It is nine days later and the costume is falling apart. By the third wear, holes and fraying occurred. I have sewn it back together at least five times. It is horrible. The costume itself is poorly made. It is thin nylon material with a mask that looks nothing like the one in the picture.Do not waste your money, the costume will not last past the first wearing."
3,Horrible quality,"I had bought this costume for my son to wear on Halloween. I tried it on him today to make sure it fit. He ran around in it for over an hour, when I went to take it off of him I noticed tears starting from the collar of the costume and going down to the spider on the chest. My son loves spider man and I hoped he would be able to wear it for pretend play after halloween but I do not think it will last very long.My son just turned 4, he wears a size 5 in boys but I bought this costume in a medium 7-8 since most costumes run small. The legs are a bit long but it fits him well, it is not baggy on him. If I ordered him a smaller size I do not think it would fit. So be aware and order a size bigger for your child especially if they will want to wear it everyday. There is only 2 small nose holes on the mask which I plan to make larger."
2,doesn't match the picture,"Was very disappointed in this costume. Admittedly, only find a problem with one aspect - so far. But if you show me a picture of what the product looks like... THEN THAT IS WHAT IT SHOULD BE!!!!! The mask on the toddler size of this costume is only half a mask. It is a cap of sorts with pieces that hang down over the eyes. It does not cover the face or ears!!Would never have chosen this costume if the correct picture had been shown!"
2,Cheaply made,"Although my son LOVES this costume and plays with it all the time, I am not happy with it at all. It is VERY cheaply made. Within one day of use, the seams started to rip and fray. The material it is made out of runs easily (like nylons do). I suppose it's my fault for not reading the reviews more carefully. If your child will only wear this once, then it is a perfect costume, but if he wants to ""live"" in it then I would recommend investing in something a little more durable."
3,"Great idea, Cheap product","We bought this for our son for his 6th birthday - he swore it was what he wanted. We let him wear it for his birthday party and by the end of the party, it was ripped and had strain lines around his neck. The fabric is so cheap and thin that it wore out after only 3 hours? Did they think that children just use a superhero costume for walking around in? We are the kind of parents that let him keep a bin of dress up clothes year around and if we are spending this much money on a costume, we want him to be able to use it more then once."
4,My grandson is so happy,"This classic spiderman put a big smile in my grandson face...that was enough for me. He is 5 years old now, and I try to promote the idea that we need heores. FOr the time being Spiderman is his favorite, and he is wearing every single day. Love that."
4,Spiderman costume,My daughter loves this costume and wears it almost every day. It seems to be more durable than the costumes in the past.
3,happy grand son,"J'ai acheté ce jouet pour mon petit fils. Je ne peux pas le noter, parce qu'il vit trop loin de moi."
3,Spiderman Costume,"We bought this for our 4 year old son for his birthday. He absolutely loves it and wears it often, even to bed. The front is now worn out and snagged. The material is not very durable that's why I rated it 3 stars overall. Nonetheless, if you don't sew,this is a good costume for Halloween or a dress up party, just not something to wear all the time."
3,Spiderman costume,My little man puts this on a hundred times a day and loves it. I have to keep sewing it together though.
3,class,"I need this for class, I will not say its a good read but not bad, however if I did not have to it for class I would not have."
4,In the beginning was a critic...,"I read this years ago, before Schrader was well known as either a screenwriter or a director, but this book introduced me to the three great filmmakers he analyzes here. Hard to believe the same writer would go on to script TAXI DRIVER, HARDCORE, and RAGING BULL. But after you read this you will see the 'transcendental' element is in all of Schrader's screenplays. This book is not for the ""movie buff"" but a more scholarly audience. But if you are a Schrader fan, it is a must read."
4,Fun read.Great for a snow day or a cold winter night!,"This book is a great read - everything that women's fiction should be. It's a lighthearted story about a young woman who grew up at the lower end of the socio-economic scale in Kentucky and is able to achieve her dreams. If you are a twenty-something woman, if you are from Kentucky, WVa or similar, if you are new to the corporate world or NYC, if you are looking for love in all the wrong places, you will relate to and really enjoy the protagonist here. Enjoy."
4,Gen X Comes of Age,"Dish It Up Baby is stylish, cotton-candy pink, big lipstick kiss schmaltz -- with a brain.It's a coming-of-age story, but it's not about adolescence. I'm kind of tired of books about adolescence. It's nice to read about a woman in her 20s, out of college, having been married, working, and coming to terms with herself and the world.This is fiction inspired by a sharp observant mind and spoken from a deep heart. Terrible things happen to the heroine. You know she will survive because she's writing the book, but you don't know how.The story of how she makes it will keep you going from Manhattan to Brooklyn, from the World Trade Centers to the corner drugstore. Details of life in the city are finely drawn. Style is choppy on purpose, staccato like urban movement.At the end of this book you will say, ""Yes, I can see how that happened."" And you will want to read more books by this author."
2,disappointed,"i really wanted to like this book. i bought it because i read the author's online diary and i enjoyed it. i think the book really needed more work. it's essentially the transcripts of her online diary with seemingly very little change. what made for a great online diary, did not translate well into a book. the characters and the situations needed to be fleshed out, given more life and flavor. i think this writer has real potential, but it doesn't show with this book. i hope she continues to write and publish because i think she's capable of much, much more."
1,An absolute disappointment,"I was completely disappointed in Ms. Helm's novel, Dish it up, Baby. The fact that this book was written as a novel, and not as an autobiography, as it clearly should have been, leads me to question Ms. Helms credibility and her struggle with developing her own self. The main focus of the book revolved around Ms. Helms and her personal experiences but by disregarding the other individuals in her life and not developing any of these characters, she totally misses out on the opportunity to prove herself as a credible and respectable author. While her attention to detail and fun witty descriptions of certain events did make the book entertaining to read at times, I found myself feeling emotionally unsatisfied and unable to connect to the protagonist in any way, shape or form. Before writing another book, I truly hope that Ms. Helm will have the ability to be true to herself and develop a storyline and characters that reach out and touch her readers in an honest and true way."
3,Not a friend of Kristie's,"As someone who read Cubiclegirl and now reads her blog at The Dish, it's painfully obvious that the reviews are being written by the author's friends (jeez, just look at the cities listed.) A non-biased review is warranted. The book is quirky, and one needs to adjust to her. writing. style. While she paints a beautiful picture of NYC with her words, the characters just don't SEEM real. I do see real potential here, though."
4,I Loved the Details,"I loved the details (especially the blue shopping cart lady with the banana pudding breakfast) and the lyrical, emotional descriptions, especially the protagonist's childhood in Kentucky. I like the style which allows Ms. Helms to be funny and touching and true all at once, without being syrupy or heavy-handed. She is many things (Southern lady, lesbian, cubiclegirl) and they're all a part of the story. Mostly it's a story of a woman finding her way in the world and choosing to ""live the life she loves"" and then making it happen with grit and determination--in her own words, ""Because the alternative was to allow the world to knock you over."""
1,Because zero stars wasn't an option,"I'm not certain what would possess a publishing company to put on page what one can read for free on screen. It's trite either way, at least you can rip up the pages of the book.It can hold one's interest, for a page or two, then you're like, ""would something just happen already.""You want journal stuff, read Sylvia Plath. She had a life."
3,Teetering on the fence,"On the one hand, the songs are quite good, going back and forth between Tonio K's usual sarcastic commentary and a more compassionate, love-fueled stance. Unfortunately, the early 80s production is extremely dated. The synth programming in particular seems completely at odds with K's aesthetic vision. Not K's fault, really - he was just keeping up with the times and trying to spread his message. But it means the record doesn't hold up as well as I'd like it to."
4,New Jay-Z Fan,"Well I didnt use to like Jay-Z. I thought his music was foul and a big disrespect to women, but I started to like him when he came out with Vol. 2. My friend played it all the time and I've grown to like it! I know, he does talk just about all the money he made, and how he treats women but I do think his beats are pretty good! I dont really care for Amil either, he could of found someone else, if u ask me! But I do think Big Pimpin is good, S. Carter, The Things That U Do................ I think they sound pretty good but his first and second album is a lot better."
3,not his best but its still cool,"i think that hard knock life was his best work. but this cd is still cool. big pimpin, that song w/ Juve and a few more are about the best songs on the cd but its still a pretty good cd. if you rep. tha east coast and you a jigga/jahova fan then you do your thing and buy your s.(dot) carter cd"
5,One Of The Best,"I bought this album when it first was released,it is different than Vol.2 but it is one of the best albums i've ever heard. It is good that ""Jigga My Nigga,and ""Girls Best Friend"" are on this album.The other good tracks are ""Do It Again"",""Dope Man"",and""Big Pimpin"".But it's too bad that ""anything"" isn't on here,but U should still Buy This."
4,jigga,Jay z life and times of s. carter a decent album couple of head nodders to get you bouncin I always liked old jay z todays music sucks 99-2000 the best years in hip hop. MEMPHIS BLEEK BEANIE SIGEL ARE GOOD ON THIS ALBUM KINDA WISHED FOR MORE BLEEK ON THIS ALBUM THE DYNASTY IS GOOD TOO.JIGGA
4,Volume 3: The Life & Times of S Carter- Jay-Z,"I enjoyed listening to the beats from the album. It was about 40,000 copies away from going Gold in its first week, went on to go 3x Platinum, went No.1 on Billboard 200, was rated well by professionals Rolling Stones, Robert Christgau, USA Today, and The Village Voice, had producers DJ Premier, Swizz Beats, DJ Clue, and Dr. Dre, and has a hidden track (Anything). I would suggest getting this CD."
1,ok everyone grow up,"""~this goes out to all the 10 year old kids who are givin' this cd 5 starz and sayin' this album is the bomb. let me tell you, you dont have to say that i like jay z to be cool and look hard. face it you all hate this album and apart from dope man this album is whack. only 10 year old kids who want to look harcore and grown up by this kind of trash. i think jay z should have left the business as soon as he released his first album. 2pac or dmx or even the spice girls. ha ha"
1,Just not good music,"I dont know how this appears under the guise of music. I mean I like rap and all but this Jay Z has 1) no flow 2) wack beats 3) no lyrics 4) poor songs concepts. I bought this CD the day it came out and was very disapointed. I also bought ""2Pac and Outlawz Still I Rise"" CD on the same day and it was great. Cop that one before you get this one because 2Pac's one sounds like they spent time on it, while Jay Z's sounds like some stuff they banged out in a weekend."
2,Save your MONEY!,"Im tellin you, please save your money. This isn't the typical Jay-Z music. It's different because the beats are horrible and boring and the lyrics, well the are no good because it sounds like jay-z is mumbling. This is the fall of Jay-z"
2,Okay but definitly not a Classic,Vol.3 is a bad attempt by the king of new york Jigga. Jay-Hova delivers a horrible effort on this one because it has weak beats and horrible lyrics.
2,Third time is not the charm for this guy,"Just as I thought, only the true Jay-Z fans would praise this mess of an album on this page. I was feeling Jay-Z on his ""In My Lifetime"" and his volumeII, but this third one was...(In the reviewer Mr. T's words)....Bogus and not knarly. It's like a much weaker version of the ""Lifetime"" album. And there is one cheezy song called ""Anything"" that was left out of this album *thankfully*. It sounded too much like ""Hard Knock Life"". It was cute to have the kids on the first song, but did he have to do it again? This shows that Jay-Z is running out of ideas. There was only one song that truely stands out and it's that bada** cut he did with UGK, ""Big Pimpin""! I sincerly hope that UGK use that song on their upcomming CD (which I predict is going to be off the hook!)"
1,WEAK,I GOT THIS GARBO ON BOOTLEG FROM CHEL GREASY ABOUT A WEEK AGO.Jay-z is sleeply he needs to take a nap. THIS BRINGS TEARS TO MY I TO SEE A RAPPER FROM THE EAST COAST BRING SUCH A WEAK CD.
1,same old song,"no wonder jay z&mariah carey are buddys they both write the same topics over&over again.all jay z writes about is diamonds,cars,&money ever heard of race?class? how long does it take for him to come up with lyrics? and his rapping is a joke as well.but it makes sense since he discovered foxy brown? let me guess vol 4,5,6,7,8,9, will have money&diamonds as well? what a great mind that jay z? not!"
1,This albm is dreadful,"when an album like this receives any good reviews you know that hip hop has diedthis album stinks... the beats are terrible... the song concepts are lousy... even the rappers voice sounds like someone who hasn't slept in days and is trying to ""get it over with""...Dont waste your money on this monkey poop."
5,blazin,yo this jay z album was off the hook. who ever doesn't like this album doesn't know real hip hop. Jay z is the best
3,Jigga brings a weaker one,"Jiggas fallen off his game scince vol. 2. hes got some hot tracks on this album, dont get me wrong, but its ovbisly not as good as the untoucable vol. 2. He's got too many tracks abouts his dolla dolla bills. Hes gotten full of himself after an unbelivable vol. 2 and thinks all he has to do is spit rhymes wit somthin in the backgroud, but i hop y'all aint that stupid. his beats are weak, but not horrible lyrics."
2,"Grow up, move on","How long can a multi-millionaire whine about his hard-knock life before people realize he's just striking a pose? How long can he claim to fight the power when most people know that, with his kind of money, he IS the power? The music is this CD is OK - no real edge, but not too boring, either - but the message is so, so tired."
2,Brother Pimping backround music is a ripoff,"The background music of Brother Pimpin (track #11) belongs to an Egyptian musician. I used to listen to that tune years ago when I was a kid growing up in the Middle East. I thought that some credit would be given to that artist, but none was to be found in the JAY-Z's CD. Isn't it illegal for an artist to do that? Or at least a credit should have been given to the Egyptian artist. I just thought that this was just a rip off."
4,rip pacman that is bullsh*t,"ok i can deal with you saying that this album is average even though i feel it is a very solid album not near the quality of reasonable doubt but it is worth picking up and as far as calling UGK ""average texas rappers"" thats like calling 2pac an average west coast rapper thats bullsh*t"
1,I HATE THIS ALBUM!,"This is by far THE WORST RAP ALBUM EVER MADE in my opinion. Only a few good song's are on here: dope man, things that you do, pop 4 roc, big pimpin, and the song he did with Dre.Some like it hot has THE MOST STUPIDEST BEAT I EVER HEARD IN A RAP SONG! Timbaland was straight trippin when he made that beat, and I dont know what the hell Damon Dash was thinking when he put out this album, either he was high or drunk on something, this is the one record that made me leave rap, except for the likes of Eminem, and D-12.So dont buy this album, it is not worth the $16, it is just better just downloading big pimpin off the internet, so that way you save the other $15 for the next 50 Cent album."
1,Thank's to UGK,"There is only 1 good song on this album, Big Pimpin. The only reason it is good is because of UGK. I used to be a fan of Jay-z but he put no effort into this album. Don't buy it."
4,Big Pimpin,"My man Jay-Z has done it and it get's better and better! Jay-Z is one of the hottest rappers out there today and I think it has alot to do with his new c.d. Volume 3-The Life of Sean Carter! The only thing I didn't like about this c.d. is it didn't have the song ""Anything"" on it. Other then that this c.d. was the bomb! It had classics samples on it mixed with Jay-Z's hot lyrics that even made my mom bounce and drop it like it's hot! Don't be fooled by the negitivity that people say, because Sean Carter is a rising star!"
2,Falling off or going commercial?,"I remember when vol.2 came out the big talk was about Jay-z getting 4 1/2 mics and Outkast getting 5. I have both and can't complain, but now after hearing this album you have to ask is he just going falling off or going commercial. Jay-z's quick to tell you that he's just in it for the money and it shows. The beats were tight with a line up of some of the best producers but the lyrics were garbage, little itty bitty childish rhymes courtesy for his new audience. I can say that the only tracks where shows some of the skills that made vol2 so hot are ""Dope Man"" and maybe ""big Pimping."" So should you buy this cause everyone has it or because you're in it for the rhyming skills. Jay-z has the skills but they are not on this album, pick up vol2 or better yet pick up artists like Mos Def, Common and Outkast (if you don't already have that one), but don't waste you money."
4,it's real,"look the man is doing his thing, so what if it gets to his head, anyone with his account and skills would let it get to theirs' too. I've been listening to Jay since ""I can't get wit dat"" and it's obvious he hasn't lost his touch, he's making more money then your average professional out there. I admire and respect him aside from all the S**T talking that is done out there about him. By the way I think you're a beautiful man Shawn Carter I love you, do your thing baby!"
1,I HATE this album!,"After the massive sucess of the hugely underrated Hard Knock Life Vol.2, Jay-Z was decoming the new mainstream darling of hip hop, and deservedly so. I preordered Vol.3 a month in advance, expecting to hear some more classic Jigga bravado. Instead I heard , to summarize, absolute junk. I can't believe how bad this album is; Big Pimpin with UGK is great, but the rest of it is total trash! Avoid this like the plague!"
2,"Wack, but he can do better","Z was at a low point when making this album. It was a bit of a cross over from Hard Knock Life (which was good, not great) to his next album. It feels as though he just put this out so the fanbase wouldn't forget about him. The Dre song (watch me) and It's Hot are pretty good. That's about it. But, as we see later, the Blueprint was well worth the wait and the two mediocre releases before it."
1,It's stupid,Its so stupid it makes me sick. throughout the whole album he jibber jabbers. He is a no talent who makes it in the world by draining the money out of all the people who like him
2,NOT THIS TIME JIGGA,"THE JIGGA MAN JAY-Z IS BACK ON THE BLOCK WITH A NEW ALBUM.SORRY TO SAY,BUT,THERE IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT.THIS ALBUM IS NOT HITTING.JIGGA'S FLO IS TIGHT AS USUAL,BUT BEAT'S ARE CORNY.SUBJECT MATTER IS THE SAME NOTHING CHANGED.OF COARSE JIGGA IS GOING TO SELL,BUT NOT BECAUSE THE ALBUM IS HOT,IT'S BECAUSE IT'S JIGGA.SO, THIS ONE FAILS,BUT I MIGHT BE ONE IN A MILLION"
5,"Jay-z volume 3, the hottest cd ever","Jay-z volume 3 brings to you everything that you would expect from the greatest rapper of all time. This cd is all about The life and times of shawn carter, so its about him. To this cd he brings dope lyrics and it features other rap stars such as juvenile, Dr dre, and other rockefella buddies like beanie sigel and memphis bleek. All the songs on the cd are hot, and one of them is even a mock trial about an event that transpired in his life. All in all one of the best cd's ever, if you dont have this cd yet, i suggest you go and buy it soon. I know i had it the day that it came out."
5,A Dynasty Like NOOOOO Other,This CD like every other Jigga CD is da BOMB! No wonder I love him soooo much. Especially the song w/ Mariah.... joint is HOT!
2,BORING!!!!!!,"whats with all of these irish sounding whistles that east cost rappers have in their music? its ANNOYING!.i bought this cd because of big pimpin,and i thought hey papi was gonna be on here.other then that and maybe the song call theres been a murder this album is kinda so so.jay-z's rap skill is good but i can't get into his above average flow.it seems like he's just talking in rhymes and not actually flowing.every jay-z album i heard there was always just a hand full of trax i like.this album is no exception.fans from his pre in my life time days have long abandoned him.but he has picked up fans from his post reasonable doubt days.whom basicaly just jumped the band wagon.and they jumped rather late i might add."
2,Come on. . .,"He said Jay-Z was dead on the song There's Been A Murder, but he had me fooled with the redundant subject matter throughout the album. All the talk of murder, clothes, cars and women have become played and it's time to move on to something else. I bought this thinking that I would hear something different. The only jams worth checking for are So Ghetto, Dopeman, There's Been A Murder, and NYMP. I used to dig Big Pimpin, when I first bought the album, but the radio stations and video networks have made me hate it because they have played it to no end. After peeping all of his other albums, this album is a major disappointment. If Jay-Z was dead, then he has been resurrected on this album."
3,Jay-Z makes other rappers look like Gay-Z,"This cd is tight.It has 7 nice tracks.Which are ""So ghetto,Do it again,Things that u do,S.Carter,Pop4Roc,Watch me,and big pimpin.The other 8 are okay too.Even though this cd doesn't beat his last one it is still a good cd to own if you are a Jay-Z fan.Plus they are some tight bonus tracks which everybody probably have heard on the radio.I would of gave this cd a 4 if he would of put that song Anything on it.But if you want that song its on the Beanie Sigel cd.Peaceout to all my jiggas all across the world"
4,the jiggaman,"i can tell that jay-z has some rock-n-roll roots in his life on this cd. my favorite song is Do it Again, its just cool to jam to. He uses adlib a little to much just as all the other rappers do, for what reason, i dont know. I'm happy that he has at least more than one jam on the entire cd. I'm also happy that he doesn't have a bunch of intro's and outro's like the other rappers have on their cd. that really pisses me off. Other than that, good job."
5,Again,This one best album of the year at the Grammy's. If it is best album all year how is it not 5 stars.
2,Jay'z Worst album,This is a VERY dissapointing album from Jay-z...Volume 2 was a good record..this is very wack. He have recovered ever since. He hasnt made a good album since Volume 2.
3,Good album but not Jiggas best... Definitly not a 5 mic album...,"""So Ghetto"" (5/5 bangin Premo beat 2nd best song off the album)""Do It Again"" (3.5/5 it's good but I prefer Jadakiss's reply song Put Ya Hands down better)""Dope Man"" (4/5 mics good song)""Things That U Do"" (1/5 mariah Carey should be banned off of rappers albums)""It's Hot"" (4/5 , definite banger)Snoopy Track (5/5 the best song off the album amazing beat)""S. Carter"" (4/5 almost corny beat but still funky somehow)""Pop 4 Roc"" (3.5/5 without Amil this song would've gotten a 4/5)""Watch Me"" (2/5 boring)""Big Pimpin'"" (3/5 okay)""There's Been A Murder"" (3/5 good lyrics weak production)""Come And Get Me"" (4/5 i like this one, it's basicly 2 tracks mixed up 2 one)""NYMP"" (3.5/5 it's straight)the european release is better than the US one has , the EUROPEAN version has got ""ANYTHING"" and ""IS THAT YOUR CHICK"" instead of ""There's Been A Murder"" and ""Watch Me"".I suggest you buy REASONABLE DOUBT or BLUEPRINT or DYNASTY before you feel forced to buy this"
1,THIS ALBUM SUCKS!!!,I cant even begin to descibe to you how much this cd sucks.Same repetitive beats on all the songs and the only song worthy listening to is big pimping.The lyrics are all pointless and stupid as can be expected fom this clown.Do yourself a favor and download big pimping because thats the only good song on the album.DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE!!!
3,What Theee #$%@,Has anybody besides me realized dat jay-z isnt really sayin anything but complex ass sentences that hav nothin to do wit the sentence prior. He jus do it good.Its jus damn ridiculous. Nas is really sayin somethin. Get that album and stop da d&%k ridin!!!
1,Horrible!,"I love Jay Z so I was really excited when this was released. To my dismay, this was one of the worst rap albums I had ever heard. So many horrible songs like So Ghetto, and Do it Again I found myself pressing the skip button after every 30 seconds. Old recycled lyrics, over produced beats, boring flow. You can do better than this! I think he just put this album out because he knew anything made by Jay Z was going to sell.... a lot. So he just put this album out to make some extra money like The Blueprint 2.1. Don't buy this or any other of his horrible albums. Buy the good ones. That makes sense, does it not?"
1,Not his best.,"The only reason I got the CD is because of ""Big Pimpin"" and ""Those Things That You Do"" ft.Mariah Carey. And those are the only 2 good songs on the CD."
2,JiGGa has fallen off!,"This albulm was WEAK! Funny how jigga thought he'd top 1 million in first week sales and he ended up not even selling half that! DMX sold 250,000 more in his first week then this fat lip jabroni did! the cd itself is weak, the first single do it again is one of the dumbest songs i've ever heard. the intro sounds cool and i thought it'd be an upbeat song but the beat is slow and the guest appearances on that song is wack, especially beanie siegel, this guy has no skills at all. overall the rest of the cd is aight, some hot songs but nothing compared to vol 2. jay z needs to hook up with x and ja rule again! maybe better luck next time, and set ur goals lower cuz ur never gonna top x."
4,jay z,"Uh-huh! ROC-A-FELLA YALL! ONCE AGAIN, HOVA HAS PROVEN HE IS THE ""GOD"" EMCEE. EVEN THOUGH I GOT THE BOOTLEG COPY ABOUT TWO OR THREE WEEKS BEFORE THE ACTUAL ALBUM CAME OUT, I STILL HAD TO GET THE REAL DEAL. PRODUCTION ON THE ALBUM IS RIDICULOUS. AND THE LYRICS... "" IT GETS NO BETTER THAN THIS"". FORGET ABOUT THE EVER LASTING DEBATE "" WHO'S THE BEST MC/ BIGGIE, JAY-Z, OR NAS""...WE GOT AN ANSWER!"
1,Save your money!,"Oh man is this CD horrible. I read all of these good reviews on this website but I have no clue how people can think this album is ""Hot"" or a ""Classic."" I love rap and listen to almost everyone but I have to admit i wasted my money. This album has weak beats, and horrible lyrics. Jay-z sounds like he's just mumbling. Go buy DMX or Tupac"
2,A true disappointment,"This album was terrible in comparison to the critically acclaimed classic HARD KNOCK LIFE. The intro of the album makes you think that Jay-Z is going back to the streets a second time, but in fact Jay-Z's just going to the mirror on this one. I mean true he has Primo and Timberland on this album, but that still doesn't save this album. This Jay-Z album packs half-hearted songs that were rushed just to keep his place on top. If he wanted to do that, I'm pretty sure he could've used some unreleased tracks from HARD KNOCK LIFE to do this album... I can't see how this album even went 3x platinum, but this was the foreshadow of what was to come from Jay-Z."
1,THA HELL WIT JAY-Z!,THIS ALBUM IS A SELL OUT.HE TRY'S TO BE LIKE THA WEST SIDE WITH THA BIG WHITE BOAT.YOU KNOW WHO HAS THA BIG WHITE BOAT.HE IS A TROPICAL CROSS DRESSER.I WOULD GIVE IT NO STARS BUT IT WON'T ALLOW ME.THA WEST SIDE 4 LIFE.YA FEEL ME!
1,awful,"This is one of the worst albums I ever heard, I was a fan of Jay-Z before this album came out but after I heard this album I realised that he fell off and when Nas ""Ether""'d him a year later it proved that he really hit rock bottom, don't buy this sell-out garbage!"
4,4.5 stars: Great follow up to Hard Knock Life,Jay's streak continued with Vol 3. He has some of the most potent album cuts ever. His album cuts are tighter than the majority of other rapper's singles. Could have been a classic if he had taken out 4 songs.Top Joints:Hova Song (intro)So GhettoDo It Again (Put Ya Hands Up)Dope ManIt's Hot (Some Like It Hot) (A little heat for 50)Snoopy Track (featuring Juvenile) (Should have been a single)S. Carter (featuring Amil)Big Pimpin' (featuring UGK) Classic!There's Been A Murder (Tight)Come And Get Me (Shots to give)
3,The Real Review,"When I think if Jay-Z, I think of driving the FDR at midnight. New York gritty hip-hop. ""More money , More cash, More hoes"" brought me there. Those gritty beats this album is lacking with the exceptions of a few tracks. I like Jay-Z's style, but I guess I'm expecting too much from the given ""King of NYC"" Don't get me wrong, it's definately worth adding to your collection, just don't go out of your way to get it."
1,jigga why?,"If you are a true hiphop fan, do not buy this album. Jay-Z represents everything that is wrong with hiphop. His beats are sorry and he has got no rhymes. I have yet to find a slower MC. If you want to get a good album, purchase jurassic 5 or dialated peoples. Please stop supporting this hip-hop travesty."
1,LIFE AND TIMES OF A WHACK RAPPER,"I admit I think Vol.1 is alright. But this Vol.3 is just trash. Song 4 song this album had my ears beggin' for mercy. The production was extremely poor. And Jiggas rhymes was so weak. Why can't he make more tracks like "" a million and one questions/rhyme no more "". That was a good song. But tracks like "" Big Pimpin' "" and "" Come and get me "" wit that annoying singing he did had me leaving the room fast. It doesn't matter, my brother bought it BOOTLEG anyway."
2,slippin,"This album is just dissapointing. All the things about Jay-Z that made him great are gone in this album. Some of the songs are so bad (s.carter) that they ruin the rest of the CD. Jay-Z needs to sit back down and re-evaluate his position in the game. All the wit, interesting anecdotes, and elaborate lyrical pictures that made him the best are missing. The rhymes are just wack, and i dont even wanna talk about the beats.The reason im not giving it a one is that some of his original verbal mastery remains(Do it again, so ghetto). It was trying to be a mainstream album by featuring Juvenile , Dre, and mariah carey and it ended up loosing Jay-Zs essence."
1,Would anyone please explain to this fool the word blasphemy?,The constant blasphemy has to stop. Repent while you still have time
2,SAVE YOUR MONEY!,"My goodness...where to start? First of all, no one with a lower lip THAT big should try to act hardcore. Jay tries to fit into that typical thug image associated with DMX, 2Pac, etc and it just doesn't work. His songs lack originality and attitude. Jigga's voice is slower and more dull than ever (i know, it's hard to believe after suffering through Hard Knock Life). I could go on for hours criticizing this joke of a rap album, but I'd rather sit back and listen to my new DMX album, which you would be much better off buying. One love"
4,Hova Does It Again,"I had to get this album after hearing Vol. II, and I was not in any way disappointed. Jay-Z is the reigning king of rap and will continue to be with cds like Blueprint,(a definite must-by) and even this one. Some of my favorite tracks on this joint is ""Dope Man"", ""Do It Again"", ""Big Pimpin'"" (although the radio played the izzo out of that song) and ""There's A Murder"". This is not Jay-Z's best cd, for it pales in comparison to both Reasonable Doubt and the new Blueprint, b/c some of the tracks seemed like fillers and was not very appealing( Things That U Do, S. Carter, and Pop 4 Roc). However, this is by no means a bad cd..it was one of the best cds to get in '99. Jigga Man, continue to do your thang..you're not better than Biggie YET, but if you continue on your blazin' path, who knows..."
3,Big Pimpin and that's it.,I have to say I bought this album after listening to Big Pimpin about 500 some times but I also expected other goods songs. Where are they??? Jay-Z definetly has some talent but there just isn't much here except for 'Pimpin.
2,QUESTIONABLE,question:can jay-z still take it to the streets to like he used to? answer: not on this lp! big pimpin watch me and snoopy track are the only good songs onthe cd. the rest with the exception of s.carter is trash. not as good beats from jay hovah and his rocafella crew as i expected.texas boyz ugk hold it down on the track big pimpin. juvenile's funky chorus on snoopy track and dr. dre's clever rhymes on watch me r what make the cd not jay-z's lame rhymes. i used to consider him one of the greatest mc's ever but fame's gotten to his head. only the guests on this cd can save him. roc la familia i can already tell isn't gonna be much betta. don't waste ur money on this unless u want some lame rhymes with even lamer beats.
3,Its AIGHT,"Usually I don't like Jay-Z, there' jus somethin I didn't like bout him after his first single on Vol. 1, BUT this album is OK, there's a couple of good tracks like ""Dope Man"" and ""Things That You Do"" I reccomend geting it, jus for these tracks alone, but there are others worth your time"
1,Album is Missing the Best Release,"I was very disappointed after buying this CD because the songs have weak samples and don't have any musicality. Jay Z's raps are tight, but if you're into backgrounds like I am you will sell your Vol 3. CD to someone else for $3 like I did. I BOUGHT THE CD initially because I'll thought the single ""I'll do anything"" with the Oliver Twist sample was on this CD. That is the only good song played on the radio by Jay Z right now, AND IT'S NOT EVEN ON THE ALBUM HE JUST DROPPED. It's kind of false advertising if you ask me. Don't make the same mistake I did. DON'T BUY THIS CD."
4,PIMPIN IT AINT EASY,THIS CD IS PRETTY TIGHT. THE TUNES ARE OFF THE HOOK. I'VE ALWAYS LIKED JAY-Z BUT THIS ALBUM IS PROBABLY THE BEST ONE YET.
3,Volume 3,"After the crossover success of 1998's Vol. 2: Hard Knock Life (complete with highly publicized samples from Annie), Jay-Z returned to the streets on his fourth proper album overall, 1999's Vol. 3: Life and Times of S. Carter. A set of hard-hitting tracks with some of the best rhymes of Jay-Z's career, the album is much more invigorating than its predecessor, and almost as consistently entertaining as his best album, In My Lifetime, Vol. 1. As good as his rapping has become, the production here plays a large part as well. Befitting his superstar status, Jay-Z boasts the cream of hip-hop producers: Timbaland (four tracks total), DJ Premier, Swizz Beatz, and Rockwilder. DJ Premier's ""So Ghetto,"" Timbaland's ""Snoopy Track"" (with Juvenile), and DJ Clue's ""Pop 4 Roc"" are innovative tracks that push the rhymes along but never intrude too much on Jay-Z's own flow. If this album doesn't quite make it up to Jay-Z's best, though, it's the fault of a few overblown production."
2,Most disappointing,"Jigga's most commercial and disappointing album, Vol. 3 has too many guest appearances, too many pop friendly beats and subject matter geared for the white suburban teen market. This album put me off Jay for a long time and it wasn't till his feud with Nas where both combatants regained their previous glory that I started listening again."
3,The Beginning Of A Slump For A Star,"This Jay-Z album is what I call a slump period for Jay-Z. He started to become extremely famous doing guest shots with people like Mariah Carey and writing for Artists like Dr. Dre.I totally understand his faults as well as his strong points on this album. There are some choice cuts here: ""Big Pimpin'"", ""So Ghetto"", ""Throw Your Hands Up"" and there are some fat chunks of garbage like ""Things That You Do"" (feat. Mariah Carey) and ""Snoopy Track"" (feat. Juvenile)As far as best to worst...out of Jay-Z's six albums I rate this one 5th on the list to buy."
1,Commercial? Hell yeah!,"What can I say about Shawn Carter? The man sells records, plain and simple. The problem is, he only talks about money and cars and women. Not that it makes him a bad MC, just not an overly creative one. I've yet to hear a song from him that uses any metaphors cleverly. In fact, the last song I heard from him like that was ""People's Court"", yeah, and all you new jacks probably never even heard that track. Well, this CD just can't get any respect because he has nothing but commercialism in his blood."
4,Jay-Z's best album,"I am a big fan of Jay-Z and he has always made good music. He has skills as an MC and is very entertaining with it. This is his best album to date, even better than his new one which is also good. Although there are a couple of slip ups on this album such as Snoopy Track, it is good pretty much all the way through. The best tracks are: So Ghetto, Do It Again, Dope Man, Things That U Do, Its Hot, Big Pimpin, Come And Get Me, NYMP, Anything. Big Pimpin is probably the best on the album even though Jiggaman doesn't do much, its featuring UGK. So Ghetto is almost as good as Big Pimpin and is a great first track. The intro is good as it usually is from Jay-Z. My advice would be to get this album, especially if you are a Jay-Z fan, even if you're not. Go get this album right now because its brilliant. Keep em comin Jigga. You can see more about me, I've done reviews of Ludacris, DMX and Jay-Z's new album."
3,Average cd form S- dot,"His 5th project is probably Jay-Z's worst solo cd's to date. There really isn't any standout tracks like he usually has. I do like ""Watch Me"" with Dr. Dre & I'm happy to see someone outside of Jive records or the south recognizes the talent and gets down with UGK {Pimp C & Bun B}. So Ghetto & NYMP are also pretty good tracks. He does get on 50 Cent who was little known at that time (His only released song was ""How to Rob"" and was in the process of recording tracks for his ""Power of the Dollar"" which never got released fully). I wouldn't recommend this cd and it's definitely not a showcasing of what he's capable of.Shawn Carter - b. 12/4/69 - Marcy, Brooklyn, NYP.S. check all my reviews"
2,Jay-Z Dies With This Album!,"Sorry, but this album isn't worth more than 2 stars. It's not a bad album, well, not TOO bad of an album, so it deserves at LEAST 2 stars. If you're a Jay-Z fan, I guess it's a must. Otherwise, leave it be."
3,OFF THE CHAIN,FIRST OF ALL BEFORE YA'LL START CURSING ME LET ME EXPLAIN WHY I COULD ONLY GIVE THIS 3 STARS NOW THE ALBUM IS BANGING BUT I PERSONALLY CAN'T GET WIT THE FACT THAT HE CALLS HIMSELF JAY HOVAH WHICH IS BLASPHEMY FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DID'T ALREADY KNOW JAY Z IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO BEING A GOD THERE IS ONLY ONE GOD AND HE IS THE ALPHA AND THE OMEGA NOW THAT I SAID MY PEACE ABOUT THAT LETS MOVE ON.BIG PIMPIN' SNOOPY TRACK DO IT AGAIN PLUS MORE ARE ALL OFF THE CHAIN EVEN JAYZ KNOWS THAT THE SOUTH IS WHERE ITS AT THAT WHY I LOVIN THAT HE HAS UGK JUVENILE AND MEMPHIS BLEEK ON THIS JOINT NOT TO MENTION BEANIE SEIGEL AND MISSY THE WHOLE JOINT IS OFF THE CHAIN
2,Jay is just like nas,"When I say Jay-z is just like Nas. I mean that as in. They both have'nt been able to live up to there first joints. ""Reasonable Doubt"" is a definite classic, we all know that, but now it's like Jigga is only rapping to please tha radio stations. This new album strated off like it was gonna be hot [tha first three songs]. Then it was tha new Jay all over again, and closing. Tha new ""Jigga Fans"" should love this album, but if you're like me just keep ""Reasonable Doubt"" in ya headphones cause aint nothing changed."
4,You are about to witness a dynasty....,"You won't find that 1 big hit like Hard Knock life on this one, But over all I think this albums has more hit tracks, like ""It's Hot"", ""Snoopy Track"" ft- Juvenile, But he only sings the hook. I think this is worth the buy...++++"
2,Not happy with Color,"While the funtional design of this case is great, the color desciption is all wrong. It should be 'silver' microfiber, with grey/silver leather accents. The only black part of the case is the attaching clip for the device. I'm returning the case becauce of the color."
5,It's GREAT!!!,"This is deffinitely worth the money, it's the best c.d. I own! They're great live, and just as wonderful through a radio. Every song is good, and most are fantastic. I absolutely love it!"
3,"Good debute, definitely worth buying","While this is an excellent CD, you probably have to love the band to love this CD. Some of the lyrics are blatantly pilfered (""She's all that he wants, she's all that he needs, she's everything he just won't believe. Take away his doubt, turn him inside out...""). There are also songs like ""Wherever You Will Go"" that can move listeners to tears. It's an excellent CD overall."
5,The Calling's Camino Palmero is one of the best,"The Calling's Camino Palmero is a awesome cd to listen to when you want some energy. There's a bunch of hot tracks bursting with energy. Their cd has a little bit for everyone. Its mainly for people who are into alternative type music. But, I think many would enjoy it. A particular song on this album, which really fits the rock format is ""Adrienne"". Its about a breakup.Its about revenge in a way. Every time he see's her with some other guy, it makes him feel good, because she was horrible to him, and he knows that this guy doesn't give a damn about her. Its a great alternative/ rock album, with some soft rock in there. Go buy it, you're not wasting your time or your money."
5,outstanding,"I saw the band do a live recording at Fox Studios in Sydney Australia and was astonished at how great that voice was. Then I found out that it was this young funky band from LA. Alex Band has a lot of talent in songwriting as well as demonstrating that great vocal range.(especially for someone so youthful)Aaron Kamin has also showed his amazing guitar and songwriting skills in this album. I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes lyrics oriented emotive soft rock. Although some people have compared them to Lifehouse,I feel that Alex's voice makes the listener more empathatic to the music than that of Jason Wade. I am a dedicated fan and probably with be for quite some time to come."
4,Great CD!,"OH MY GOSH I LOVE THIS CD! When I heard their first single ""Wherever You Will Go"" on the radio, I didn't think that the Calling was such a big deal, but I decided to give them a chance and buy the whole CD. Best decision I've made! Personally my favorite song on the album probably has to be ""Adrienne,"" but every other song is great too! Who knew such a deep voice could come out of such a little guy like Alex? It's great stuff!! Definitely an album everyone should check it out!"
5,What do I say?,"What can I really say about this album? Amazing. The vocals are powerful, strong, and overall just well done. The musicianship overall is quite good. Not for you if you're looking for a hard extremely edgy rock band, but if you like emo-pop with a hard edge, you will almost certainly like this album. From ""Wherever you will go"" and ""Stigmatized"" (Slower ballad-like songs) to ""Adrienne"" (You just may want to injure this girl after this song) and ""Thank you"" this album has so many facets, all with one thing in common: An evident and powerful emotional backdrop. I really couldn't pick a favourite song. All the songs truly were good. They all had lyrics that I could relate to in at least some small aspect. ""Could it be any harder"" is a title I just had to mention. Truly a beautiful song. This album is an amazing album. It may not be full of songs that you will be singing, but they are all well performed and well written. This album is definitely worth taking a look at."
1,let's reheat this again..,"time to warm up the old frozen alternative blueprint, because we have another radio-band stepping up to the plate! With lyrically disfunctional songs that are awash in easy chords and heart-tugging vocal deliveries, this album will be sure to get the group a whole bunch of female companions, and maybe some sensitive new-age guys who want to just weep, weep, weep to this deep, deep, deep music.Smells like bad lite-alternative band spirit."
5,Gorgeous effort,"What can I say besides this CD hasn't left my player since I bought it? Pretty much every song is beautiful with Alex's deep, excellent voice backed up with catchy riffs and melodys of an equally talented band. Among my favorites:0.6. Adrienne- I love this song in every aspect possible. The lyrics I can relate to very well and it's just a song I can't help hitting the repeat button a few times for.A great melody as well.0.7. We're Forgiven- Catchy chorus, great lyrics, nice melody. This song definately makes one think!0.9. Just that Good- The chorus is absolutely great, and Alex's voice just makes this song..11. Stigmatized- It's slower than the others, but powerful because of the words. Just listen.Well actually I love all the songs except ""Thank You"", so I recommend buying this CD to here a very exceptional band."
3,One GREAT song,I bought this for the one great song. I thought I could adapt to the rest but it is strangely old foggy and I really cannot listen to it often. Alex Band is so very talented . He should consider having someone help him write songs and or buying some more modern songs. I love you Alex!
2,This album sucks.,"Sorry to be so blunt, but I think this album sucked. ""Wherever You Will Go"" and ""Adrienne"" are the best songs on the album, and they're both singles. The rest of the album is boring and uninspired. I could have saved myself a lot of money by just buying those two songs as singles.I was really disappointed because Alex Band's voice is so cool. It's deep and smooth. I loved his collaboration with Santana and wish he could retain a similar sound with his own band. If The Calling ever puts out another album, I'd be willing to give it a chance."
4,"Great Voice, Hot Singer","Ok, I just heard the song ""Wherever you will go"" by the Calling, 2 days ago. I actually saw the video 2 days ago. It was on Much Music and I almost peed my pants over the lead singer. He has the greatest voice and it makes me go crazy and hes so cute. I don't like to use that word but I have no other way to explain it. Well, today, I decided to download the song after hours of searching for the video on Kazaa. Then, after listening to it on and on again, I came onto Amazon.com and bought the CD. It should be here in a few days. I can't wait. That guy can sure sing and they play great! I'm excited!"
1,Less Than Ordinary.....Too bad,"I was really looking forward to hearing this CD....Too bad it is such a disappointment. The songwriting is weak, the lyrics mundane....as the band tries to sound like Matchbox 20, Lifehouse, or any of a 100 other soundalike bands who have all done this much better. The album falls flat....especially when put up against outstanding new releases like Jimmy Eat World, Puddle of Mudd, Five For Fighting and Built to Spill. Spend your money on something worthwhile....I am not sure what this band's ""calling"" is, but it is certainly not music."
2,A poor man's Matchbox 20,"I'm sorry, but these guys just don't cut it. The musicianship lacks the imagination that Matchbox 20 can inject into some of their songs (i.e. Busted, Real World, etc.) and the lyrics aren't as good as the oftentimes profound lyrics of Rob Thomas. On top of that, these guys dropped out of high school at THEIR LABEL'S REQUEST. It's bad enough when you drop out of high school, but at your label's request. I'll give these guys some credit though for being a bunch of middle-class suburbanites and not jumping on the trendy angst-train like so many others."
2,Sorry to break it to you folks,But this has been done before. That singer guy's voice is so forced I can't stand a single song.
1,what a waste!,the calling's album Camino Palmero is a waste of time and money. the only good song on the album is wherever you will go. that's it. enough said
4,Good music,"A friend bought Camino Palmero(CP) for me as a gift. At first I didnt really look forward to listening to CP but one day(a few days after I received the album), I just shrugged and started listening to the album, over and over again. The songs are really catchy and addictive. Well, most of them. I wouldnt say their songs are 'hard rock' but it's not pop either. Somewhere in between I guess. Anyways, in CP the best songs(to me) are Unstoppable, Whereevr You Will GO, Adrienne, Could It Be Any Harder, Things Dont Always Turn Out That Way & Stigmatized. Alex's voice. Yum. Camino Palmero :- A must-have!"
5,The Calling Rocks!!!,"The Calling, is a absolute gem. great music that hit even the best of Music Fans, My favorite song is ""Wherever you well go"".It seems Wherever You go, The Calling well be there to knock your socks off."
5,The Calling's Camino Palmero,"The first time I heard the first single off of this cd, I liked it. I was watching MTV and I caught the video for ""Wherever You Will Go"" and I thought it was a really awesome song and video. Here, I ended up getting the cd because I began to hear more and more about The Calling and now I'm hooked. There's not one song on that cd that I skip over, I love them all. I don't really have a personal favorite song, but I do like ""Adrienne"", ""Forgiven"" and ""Things Don't Always Turn Out That Way"". I highly recommend this cd, they're one of the few great bands out there now."
5,awesome!,"I saw these guys in concert with Lifehouse and they were awesome, and their album reflects that! Good solid rock music with great lyrics. I espcially like ""Adrienne"" and ""Could It Be Any Harder""! I would recommend the cd to everyone. And go see them in concert!"
4,The next Pearl Jam?,"If you're a fan of Pearl Jam, then you'll enjoy The Calling. The belting voice of Alex Band may be similar to that of Eddie Vedder but there's a distinct difference between the Los Angeles native, Alex Band, and the king of Seattle sound, Pearl Jam. What is it? Soul. 'Camino Palmero' is an album that-as opposed to any Pearl Jam album-makes the blood rush through your veins and emotions to run through your head.If you're looking for a feel-good album not involving silicone sounds similar to those of Britney or 'N Sync, this is something you'll want to check out. As Band sings-even though it's much more than singing-you feel as if all of his emotions are being painted in your mind.After the picture of 'Camino Palmero' is embedded into your mind, you'll always find yourself coming back to it while in the car, sitting at your computer or at work. It's an album that has made it's mark on mainstream music and will be forever there."
4,One of the best CDs ever...,"Don't get me wrong, I love this CD. I was listening to the radio, and I heard the guitar intro and thought, ""Hey this sounds good."" Then I heard the whole song and it was just awesome.So... I went out and bought the CD, thinking that most of the other songs on the album would have the same weight as ""Wherever You Will Go.""But each song was way different from the other. For once, I didn't mind that the songs didn't carry the same weight.So, I enjoy their music a lot. Each song really expresses the way they feel.Alex has got an awesome voice, blends with the music perfectly. And the songs written by them and the instruments played are great...If you like Lifehouse, Creed or any band in that catagory of music... you'll love the Calling.buy this CD, no disappointment here..."
5,As good as everyone claims,"Yes, this cd really is THAT good... Amazing vocals, good lyrics and smooth music make and easy to swallow and hard to forget formula. I loved the single WHEREVER YOU WILL GO, and bought the cd unsure of what I would get. The other songs on the cd lived up to my high standards, and even astounded me... The real gems of the cd are: WHEREVER YOU WILL GO, STIGMITIZED, ADRIENNE, UNSTOPPABLE, (NOTHING'S CHANGED is really good too) ... Alex Band has a great voice, it reminds me of Darius Rucker (Hootie & The Blowfish)...A side note, I am an Incubus fanatic, and I don't understand how or why people have compared The Calling to Incubus... Thats apples and oranges people... Get it straight.All in all you can't go wrong when buying Camino Palmero, you'll probably love it... And if not, fifteen bucks won't break you... I hope you enjoy it though. Peace out."
5,Thank God For Some Good New Rock Music!!!,Take Incubus And Creed And Through A Pinch Of Fuel In A Bowl And Mix It Up And Your End Result Is The Awesome New Rock Group The Calling. Their Album Is In Two Words Simply Amazing. I Can't Say Enough Good Things About The Calling's Smash Hit Record 'Camino Palmero'. It's Got A Great Beat Super Guitar Riffs Fantastic Vocals And So Much More. The Calling Is Definatly Worth Checking Out. Their Website Is Great Too. (...) Their CD 'Camino Pamlmero' Is Worth Every Penny You Will Spend On It. Trust Me U Will Love This CD And The Calling.
5,HOLY FRIGGIN' COW!,"I heard a clip of ""Wherever You Will Go"" when I saw a promo for the new Star Trek series, ""Enterprise"", and WOW... I just HAD to have that song! I downloaded a couple other songs of The Calling's and after listening to them I immediately went and bought the CD.Fans of Lifehouse, The Wallflowers, Better Than Ezra, Toad The Wet Sprocket and groups like that YOU MUST BUY THIS CD!"
2,This Cd sucks,"Very disappointed. Apparently I don't get modern ""Punk"" / ""Stupid"". Bunch of same chord boring songs! I bought it for one song (Where Ever You Will Go), should have looked for a cover, or just have just bought the MP3, good luck guys!"
5,Ever good,"I used to hate Rock music before!!!!!But when I randomly search for some songs,I found The Calling,from then on,their songs are always in my MP3 player~no matter up and down,I used to listen to them~"
1,Commercialism at its worst...,"This CD is more mindless pop noise aimed at fourteen year old girls looking to buy a ""rock"" album. Purely disgusting. I like to think of myself as an open minded music fan, and I appreciate bands that are considered ""cookie cutter"" by the closed minded, like Nickelback and Tantric, because they have been around awhile and have something called talent. The Calling is different. Listen to the single, Wherever You Will Go. The lyrics have been used so many times before. The guitar part and music has been re-used way too much. And people love it! Dare not the public listen to something that challenges you. It seems like the only music that is given to the public is mindless chatter. You can't have smart lyrics, because then people begin to think. You can't have intricate songs, because then people will have to listen to your song more than once to get the hang of it. Stay away. Stay far far away. Please!"
1,A poor man's Matchbox 20,"I'm sorry, but that's just what these guys are. The instrumentals lack the imagination that Matchbox 20 has shown in songs like ""Real World"", ""Busted"", ""Bed of Lies"", and such and the lyrics can't hold sway to Rob Thomas's oftentimes profound words. Plus these guys dropped out of high school AT THEIR LABEL'S REQUEST! It's bad enough when you drop out of high school, but AT YOUR LABEL'S REQUEST! That just screams that you're in it for the money. Save your money by passing this over and getting a Matchbox 20 or Lifehouse CD instead."
2,How could they compare The Calling to Lifehouse...,when The Calling have half the talent and twice the ego...This C.d. sucks and so does their new one...stay away...these guys are sellouts who suck fat ones during their lunch break...LoL...Lunch breaks full of big juicy meats and tasty fruits. Just ask Alex Bend...he loves to down a hot dog and chase it with a flamin hot strawberry...
5,Wicked Cool !!!!!!!,"I accidentally stumbled across 'Just That Good' whilst looking for music from 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer' so I thought I'd try it and then the next day I saw the video for 'Wherever You Will Go' on one of the music channels and I've never looked back since! I don't usually like bands like Incubus and Creed but I LOVE the Calling!!!!!! They're sooooooooo cool!When I first heard their songs, I thought that the lead singer was about the same age as the guy from Nickelback and I was really shocked to see that the lead singer, Alex Band, looked about 16 years old! (He's probably much older than that but he looks very young! If you want to check out The Calling, they're in the film 'Coyote Ugly' as the background band in the 'Fiji Mermaid Bar')'Camino Palmero' is the best album I've heard in a long time!"
5,WOW! GREAT CD!,"Camino Palmero is a great CD! The music is real nice and warm. Buy it, I promise you won't regret it!"
5,Best CD I've Ever Heard!!!,"The Calling's debut CD-Camino Palmero is the best CD I've ever owned! I usually get tired of CDs when I listen to it for more than a week, but this CD's different. I just can't seem to stop listening to it! The songs in Camino Palmero are original and passionate, plus the lead vocal-Alex Band has a really great voice! These excellent compositions are definately worth buying, it would be a shame not to purchase it!"
5,Calling all Calling Fans,The Calling is a great new up and coming band. The CD is a great example of thier work. They have a great sound with Alex's low lead voice and a GREAT band to support him. The band is even better in concert!! Check out Camino Palmero and you won't regret it.
3,A little disappointing...,"After the two great singles that were ""Wherever You Will Go"" and ""Adrienne"", I have to say I expected more from this album.One major missing piece were the two superb B-sides from the single releases ""Lost"" and ""The One"". These two sublime songs were what really made me want this album more than the main singles.The album seems to lack a distinct style, ranging from rock ballads to rap/rock combos. Whereas with other artists, you would get a sense of the band's style within the first few tracks, The Calling never seem to settle down into one pattern. While this does show innovation and originality, it can be irritating, and would have been better suited to a second album.Still, a good debut, and a good platform to launch from, and some of the songs (""Unstoppable"", for one) are excellent."
5,Satisfaction Guaranteed!,"Not that anymore reviews are needed to convince others that this mass of incredible musical talent is worth buying, but it's hard not to comment on how 'worth-it' it all really is.... I had the extreme pleasure of learning of The Calling's existence live in concert @ Mobile many months ago. Boys, the show was soooooooo tight! I absolutely fell in love with the originally powerful acoustics~ not to mention the fact that any fine boy who can play the guitar like that (& drums not to disclude) is a MAJOR turn-on! I kept urging people to check them out, telling them that The Calling was going to be BIG, and whatdoyaknow?. I'm telling you, if you are as huge of a music freak as I am, & you get adrenaline rushes off mad acoustics, get Camino Palmero; it's a MUST to have in your music selection, GUARANTEED!!!"
5,The Calling creates a hit record with Camino Palmero!!!,"Some may think that my review on this album is a little biased because I know the band...but before I ever met them...this album was the BEST thing that I had purchased in a very long time. I do not own many cd's that I can listen to the entire way through and not get sick of it, but this album was an exception. Every song on the album is amazing and the lyrical content created by Alex Band and Aaron Kamin is incredible. Songs like ""Stigmatized"" and ""We're Forgiven"" are proof that this band is a force to be wreckened with. Camino Palmero is definitely one of the best albums of the year."
5,Now this is Good Music!,"Camino Palmero is the best CD that I own. I'm addicted to it, and I've had it for over six months now! The lead singer of The Calling, Alex Band is a musical genius and it helps to the effect that the band writes all of their own music. And today that's hard to find in good bands. I've told all of my friends that The Calling is one of the best live bands out there. They sounds almost exactly like they do on the CD. This band is definately not studio created! If you like the band's two hits Wherever You Will Go, and Adrienne then you will love the rest of the CD! Every song is good, scratch that...wonderful! So buy Camino Palmero, I can guarantee that you won't be disappointed!"
1,another no-good scent,"It seems OK at first, but starts to smell like vomit after lingering in the air a few seconds."
4,Incomplete Horace Hit List,"Pretty fair representation of Silver's most popular tunes before ""Song for My Father,"" which is on Vol. 2. On the other hand, neither volume contains ""essentials"" such as ""Nica's Dream,"" ""Strollin'"" and ""Moon Rays"" not to mention any of his recordings for Columbia and Epic. OK for whetting your appetite or saving some wear on the old vinyls."
4,A BEGINNER'S DEPENDABLE 'LDAP' HANDBOOK,"In his book, ""LDAP Directories Explained: An Introduction and Analysis"", Brian Arkills used subtle analysis to unveil the underlying principles of Lightweight Directory Access Protocol. This book employed a very practical approach; and included the most recent advances in LDAP technology.Both newcomers and intermediates would cherish how it explained the basics of the TCP/IP stacks; particularly, how it can be used to extract information from a hierarchial directory such as the X.500. It also gave useful suggestions on how LDAP learners could comb through data when surmising or searching for a particular piece of information, (e.g. a security certificate, an e-mail address, or similar information).In conclusion, this is an essential guide, which should provide any LDAP beginner (or enthusiast) with all the information he (or she) may need concerning this network protocol. It is worth taking a look at!"
2,400 pages of vague language,"Even though the author has 400 pages to explain this relatively simple topic, he managed to fill the book with pages of vague and unclear phrases. To the level of being almost unreadable. It is as if the author talks to his colleagues, without even trying to explain and not caring if anybody understands his abracadabra at all."
1,DVD reader goes out after 2 years of use due to heat!,"Do not buy this player if you are considering it. It was nice for a couple of years but the DVD player Optical pickup unit(which from what I've read, commonly goes out on Panasonic) is failing. It was nice to get everything in one package but I recommend not getting an amp and DVD player in one case due to the heat issues. And I am now in the process of replacing this unit with Sony components(I should have done from the start!)"
1,Do not buy,"Ok, the sound was good. Until a couple of weeks ago, that is. The latest CDs I bought will not play decently. The music is interrupted every couple of minutes by sounds that make you wonder if there is a record player inside (it sure is large enough...). Panasonic are saying I can have it repaired, which will cost me at least 40 dollars. Just about the price of a low end dvd player. You know, one of those systems that will play mp3, dvd, cd, cdr and cdrw instead of only dvds, like this Panasonic thing. Based on my experience and some of the other reviews it would seem Panasonic equipment lasts about 2 years. Hmmm."
4,"I own tons of these things, so I know everything. Really.","Maybe I don't. However, I do own this bad boy. I call it bad because we have trouble with DVD playback and the fact that the speakers are hardwired and one of the wonder mutts has a love affair with wiring. We checked, but the vet doesn't remove teeth, just claws from cats. Luckily we live right up the road from someone who knows how to fix these things and has a license to do so. Unluckily, he thinks he should be paid for such activities and he doesn't accept dogs in payment. More often than we like we have trouble with playback on a DVD. It messes up frequently. We find that we have to clean it often, no the dog can't reach it, to keep the picture from disintegrating in seizure inducing fun.The sound though, well just oh my gawd. I can lay in the middle of the living room and listen to the clarity with joy. Even better we can move the speakers to hang beside the half-deaf guy on the couch so we can actually turn down the volume."
5,THE POTENCY OF CHEAP MUSIC,"That's cheap in monetary terms, rather than the somewhat derogatory sense used by Noel Coward, because the original 78s were produced as ephemera to be sold at a low price. The other reviewers have already said it all, so let me just add that these late twenties performances are far better than you would expect, given their pedigree. The package is up to Jazz Oracle's usual high standard, with a 24-page liner note containing background, discography, and colour photos of the labels."
5,I'm trying to correct a typo in a review on line,"could you please correct a typo I overlooked in my review of HIS VICTORIOUS INDWELLING. ""Mr. Harrsion"" should be ""Mr. Harrison."" Thanks, kp"
2,Parents' nightmare,Received this as a gift. One day was a enough -- we donated it to our daycare so someone else would have to deal with it. The music is obnoxious. Even our son didn't seem that interested in it. Don't recommend buying -- even if you think you have more tolerance for such things than most parents.
2,cute but not much fun,"I bought this for my son when he was 12 months old because he loves Sesame Street. He played with it for 3 or 4 days, and showed no interest in it after that. It is a cute toy-- bright and colorful with nice music selections. It plays songs such as Skip to my Lou, This Old Man, and How to Get to Sesame Street. You can wave your hand over Ernie to make the song be played with classical instruments, Elmo for rock and roll, or Cookie Monster for jazz. You can also control the tempo and volume. There are a few piano type keys you can press, but it's hard to tell what effect they have on the song. I think overall it's hard for my son to understand the causes and effects of this toy. He's 19 months old now, and still shows no interest in this toy. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on it."
5,excellent and real,I thought this book captured the wonder and agony of childbirth and motherhood. I read it during the last part of my 2nd pregnancy and wish I had read it during the 1st!
5,The mythic quality of motherhood,"I really enjoyed this book. The author approaches the transition to motherhood from a universal, mythic perspective. She talks both about her personal experieces with motherhood as well as about how those experiences relate to the depiction of motherhood in myth and religion around the world. She draws very interesting parallels and really elucidates the sense of motherhood as being bigger than oneself. For example, the author talks about her initial desire to have children not as something soft and sweet, but instead like being forcibly abducted by the mother goddess and dragged into some subterranean realm."
4,Great driving music,"Really good variety of bands and styles on this yet it all fits together well. Tracks include Audio clips from the movie and they are pretty funny.gas pedal mashin' foot stompin', beer drinkin', fight startin' fun from begining to end."
4,Pleased,"I was skeptical at first to order a used CD online. Surprisely, I am having no issues with this CD. I listen to it all the time during my commute to work."
5,Must have Jazz CD,For all you guys out there who are not into Jazz buy this CD and you will forever remain hooked. This is one of the best Jazz CD i have ever had tracks like Jeri's Song and the one with Jeffrey Osborne are mind blowing. I don't think anyone would regret buying this CD.
4,Extremely interesting biography of one of unsung heroes of the fall of Communism.,"The Reagan shown is as far from the ""Spitting Image"" character which, sadly, has become the popular perception of the President (not in the United States) as Earth from Uranus."
4,Does what it says on the tin,"Every now and then a book comes along that does exactly what it says on the tin. Work Excellence is one of those boooks. Most Christians pay too little attention to what goes on in the workplace. Garriott redresses that balance with a little book all about work. It addresses our need to abolish the work/secular divide, to work with all our might to glorify God and to look for opportunity to live and share the gospel.The book is a great introduction to what the bible has to say about work. More is clearly needed on this subject and I hope we will see many more books written that will flesh out some of the fantastic material in this book with practical examples, and application."
5,A trip through time,"Boulder is an interesting town, and having lived here for 35 years, I've seen many changes. Sylvia Pettem has documented Boulder's transition over the past 50+ years beautifully. The photos are well done, and the way the book is laid out makes it easy for one to do a walking tour in a logical manner. This would be an excellent book for someone contemplating a move to Boulder, or even someone who has visited our town and wants to take home a memory or two."
2,Gustav Holst: Planets - The New Dimension of Sound Symphonic Series [7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio Disc] [BD25 Audio Only] [Blu-ray],"I am playing this on a Sony PS3. The mix seems to favor the center channel and left channel. That is, the sound stage seems to be skewed towards the left. I heard very little from the right. I heard no ambiance from the surrounds. The lower registers (bass) is very weak."
4,good for the price,"the material is a bit on the thin side so it can break easily, but the way i see it, it is still worth the price. i like the icing design and the fact that this is a large set. so overall, i'd say quality is okay, but the value is great so i still recommend it."
4,53 piece dinner set,"i bought this set because it was the only one i could find that was this large. luckily i received each piece undamaged. i am pretty happy with it, but there were a couple pieces that had some discoloring that looked to be baked into the glaze coating. the coffee cups are really tiny too, and the bowls have a very large lip on the edge which makes it impossible to drink the remaining milk out of a bowl of cereal without spilling it all over yourself. also, they are very heavy pieces, the plates especially. other than that, no complaints."
1,Received with some damaged parts,"Well, I can't say more than it would better idea to purchase such items directly from store to avoid delivery abuse!"
1,CST Special Education The Difference is Clear,"I haven't taken the exam yet, but I really don't see how this book will help me. I also never haveCST - Special Education (Cst Series)read any publication that contained so many typo's. I am doing the practice tests right now and they seem to question nothing that was presented in the material. I bought this book not expecting much,the other reviews were on target. I just felt I needed something to look at to review for the test, someone needs to come out with a better product."
1,This book should never have been published!,"I am contacting the publisher because I want my money back. There are typos, questions unanswered, faulty explanations. I was shocked. Do NOT buy this book!"
4,"Darklords, the kings of the Domains of Dread","This is a essential game acessory for dungeon masters who like to give to his players the real, and perfect, personality description of these lords who are very complex and uniques and make your campaign more than simple fights."
1,Misleading Information,"Misleading information. Web site sales are many times unclear. Requested 1 tube, instead was sent three tubes packaged as one unit. Instead of being charged for one tube was charged for three. Will not deal with this company again."
2,Not long lasting....,Even though this game has 2 different modes they both use the same 5(?) games. Plus the cutscenes in between hardly make sense and Mr.Krabs doesn't even sound right. This game seems like fun after you play some of the games but then the games ends and that's it. I don't reccomend this game.
3,Ok game...not sure if it's worth it.,"A friend let my siblings and I borrow this game. I was so excited because SpongeBob is one of my fave shows! I started playing it and it was kinda fun, but then it got pretty boring. The levels were kinda hard to beat, even though I did beat one so far, and it was kinda zzzzzzzz after a while. I wouldn't recommend it, although some kids 10 and under may enjoy it."
2,Spell BORING!,"I played this at my friends house and she is 8 years old. She loves it and said it was the best game! So she begs me to play it. First of all there isn't really a challenge put to this game. Its really just a bunch of mini games that have no meaning to it. Although I didn't give it 1 star because There are 2 ""mini"" games that I adore! The boating school one and the who cut the cheese. But the rest are BORING! There really isn't a selection of ""mini"" games to choose from. It could just be that my friend was a hog and woulden't give her guest a turn. But from what I saw and the little I played it was boring. I do have Spongebob Battle for Bikini Bottom on my Playstation 2 and that is what I call a fun game! Get Battle for Bikini Bottom its way cooler!"
4,A 13 year old gamer(Cool Game),If u like spongebob on tv u will love playing this game. U have to go through these different activities like boating school jelly fishing and other stuff to unlock the other games. I would recommend it for a kid that has patience and isnt a sore loser. But once u get the hang of it its tons of fun to play~!~I hope this helped u~!~:):):):)
1,NOT IMPRESSED!,"I am 10 years old and my little bro. is 3.We are big fans of spongebob. I was the first one to play it, and it gets boring VERY fast.You have to play every game 3 times, and sometimes a bonus level before advancing. You have to beat 1 game before you can play others, and the voices of the characters sound nothing like they do on TV. You can beat the entire game in less than 1 hour.Boring for older kids,more fun for younger kids."
5,Just what I'm looking for....,"For over a year I'm looking for a good book to help business analysts to understand data models drawn by others and to train them in creating basic data models needed to cover business needs. I found a lot of good books but all too heavy, too many pages, too detailed and very nice if you want to become a real heavy duty data-guru. There is absolutely nothing wrong with data gurus, every organization needs a few of those, but it needs quite a few more of the 'casual' modellers. This book .. not too big.. a good read.. and even better reread.. It contains exactly everything that is needed for those modellers.So, if you're a Business Analyst, Information Manager and need a good understanding of Data Modelling, even occasionally need to make one yourself, without having to spend years in training: buy this book.."
1,Worthless if you already know anything about data modeling,"Mislead by other reviews. Covers only basics of ERD style modeling. Not current with any UML approaches. If you only do Oracle and have never modeled, this might be a good start. Would have returned it if I could."
1,Very basic book; not worth the money,"I was disappointed to read this book as I'm a fan of the author, S. Hoberman, who usually writes good articles on the subject of modeling.This book is similar to the ""...for Idiots"" series with the difference that this book is actually for idiots unlike that popular anthology.Re: the book's title, it is clear that the audience mentioned on the cover page is a mere marketing ploy. IT professionals can safely ignore this title unless they are brand-new to the field (<1-3 months).Some business/non-technical people might find this content useful but then again why waste money on this book when you can get similar content on the Web for free?"
1,Fenomenal? Ha-Ha.,CD with technical difficulties can not be considered as a good CD. There are at least four glitches/skips I found on brand new CD. Do not buy it.Un CD con dificultades tecnicas no puede ser considerado como un buen CD. Hay al menos cuatro problemas que encontre en el nuevo CD. No lo compre.
3,Life & Times Vol. 3,"I had this when it first dropped, I definitely feel like back then it was better than it is now when I listen to it. The album is sold, there are some bangers on here like ""So Ghetto"" where Jay kills a classic Preemo beat,""Dope Man"" is another sick track, then on ""It's Hot (Some Like It Hot)"" Jay responds to the jabs thrown at him by a less famous at the time 50 cent with the one liner ""I'm about a dollar what the f*** is 50 cent"". He also made songs to appeal to the Southern fans on ""Big Pimpin"" and ""Snoopy Track"". The ""Outro"" has bonus tracks which are ""Girls Best Friend"" and ""Jigga My N****"". All in all its a decent album but nowhere near his best."
1,Save Your Money,"I started reading this book and immediately grew deeply disappointed. I was looking for a book that taught me about the lives of Moses and the judges. This book is nothing more than a gross fairy tale. If you are looking to improve your walk with God, do NOT waste your money on this book. My copy is heading for the trash can."
2,"Great looking, but wears poorly","I was really pleased to receive this case. I really liked the two toned look, and it held my Visor securely, making a nice, compact unit. However, after only one week of use, the microfiber has already begun to fray at the corners, and I will be exchanging it for an all leather case. The folks at Handspring said they had have had no complaints about the microfiber cases, so maybe mine was a lemon, but it is very disappointing."
2,"If she knew what she was talking about, this would be decent","Whippler is a good writer technically, but despite years in the religion, writes absolute garbage. I think Ann Rice vampire novels have more truth in them. I'm a Santero and reading a Whippler novel is about as realistic as reading a Harry Potter novel and expecting to find actually Hogwarts in England. She makes things up that are simply not part of the faith. It's insulting to us olochas to read her works. I wish her books could be moved to the fiction section where they belong. You won't find religion in these books. Just a lot of weird magic spells for the highly superstitious. I often wonder if she is mistaking Wicca or Hoodoo with the African diasporic traditions."
1,SERIOUS MATH PROBLEMS,"You guys have serious trouble with subtraction and percentages.30.00-10.11=19.89, not 29.88. And 25% of would be 7.50 off or 23.50. NOT EVEN CLOSE!Hoope your accounting procedures are better, for your shareholders sake."
1,Frustrating!,"This game is way too frustrating for any age group. I played it with my 6-year old nephew and 10-year-old niece, and none of us can use the keyboard well enough to succeed.The game works like a Super Mario Brothers arcade of ladders and roadblocks. The problem is that the keyboard commands do not respond well and a mouse is not supported. If you don't hit the spacebar-cursor key combination just right, you fall when trying to jump, and each time you fall, you must redo a very long sequence of moves to get back to where you left off. This becomes boring and extremely frustrating--leaving the 6-year-old near tears, the 10-year-old banging keys, and me wondering how this game ever made it past the testing stage.THQ, the manufacturer, makes a lot of games for all the popular video game machines. Perhaps with a video game controller, this game can play well, but it does not translate to a computer keyboard."
1,"Hard for kids, and even HARDER for autistic ones.","I have a brother, an autistic but smart one, and he loves rugrats and liked the ""all growed up"" tv special, so we thought this'll be good for him, because he loves kids' computer games, and it looked so easy on the commercial, so we decided to give it a try.It was extremely hard, and it took him a long time to memorise which key did what, and how to jump without dying. This really upset him, and I think I should give him Jumpstart games from now on."
2,Can't keep them on my head,"I tried to use these last weekend while I was gardening. The moment I looked down they fell off. I adjusted them often, but they just would not stay on my ears forlong. They were not expensive and I guess you get what you pay for."
5,The real blast!,"Golden Earring has always been a LIVE BAND!If their first live album didn't really recreate the power ofG.E. on stage, this 2nd LIVE really does!Recorded on their PRISONER OF THE NIGHT tour, this live album contains lots of highly boosted songs taken from that album.A couple of old tracks BACK HOME, BUDDY JOE bring us back to an almost forgotten period-before RADAR LOVE.The marvelous SLEEPWALKIN' and its bass/drums duo, SAVE YOUR SKIN(stairway to heaven's dutch brother) and the classics Long Blond Animal and Week-end Love, all in their best versions!A REAL KILLER-LIVE album featuring the energy, the sweat and the sincerity of a Golden Earring concert."
2,doesn't come close to GE Live album,"Tried to get that same feeling on these post GE live albums that I got from the original GE Live album. No way. Shallow at best. I guess I would decribe them as not too bad for a free entertainment at a local bar. What went wrong? How could this be the same band that produced one of my top 5 rock albums ever - Golden Earring live? Answer- the lack of a second guitarist(Eelco Gelling) whose contributions to the GEL album produced such heavenly interplay that truly could bring tears to my eyes. Like Ted Nugent w/o Derek St Holmes, the sum of Gelling w/ GE made the band greater than their individual parts."
1,Horribly Written,"Some people are good at communicating with words, of giving the reader a vivid image and impression in just a few choice words and sentences. Michael McGarrity is not one of those people. He may have been a great cop, and he does a good job of describing police procedure, but he's no writer.This is so poorly written that at one point he actually spells out the key plot points IN BLOCK LETTERS in case you were to slow to catch on fifty pages ago. The characters are for the most part horribly developed, and when he tries to use the voice of the various villains, the results are laughably bad. The plot is ok, but then just comes to a crashing halt and everything gets resolved.He does do a good job with the relationship between Clayton and his father, and the procedural stuff is engaging, but overall this is a stinker."
3,Realistic,"Most murder mysteries end with an ""Aha!"" and some pleasant words about the future. This book takes you through an abbreviated version of the process of gathering enough evidence to go to trial, and then blissfully spares us the courtroom drama. The characters are wooden, much of the drama staid, and worst of all, the staging of chapter and scene is formulaic, but the action is engrossing and the writing good enough. There is little poetry in it, but a gruff sense of duty and interest in the pursuit of criminals, and then some romance/drama from the main characters to keep our interest despite never fully being resolved. For readers of urban mysteries, the change of setting to rural New Mexico might seem a shock but the basic story and the personalities required to play out its drama remain the same."
1,Horrible,This was my first read of McGarrity and will be the last. Boring police procedural with perhaps the worst dialog I've read in 20 years. One wades through the book noting that almost all the police officers speak with the same voice and use the same platitudes. The Chief can't communicate with his son or his wife. Am I supposed to find this interesting? And then suddenly it ends. I usually pass books on but this one ended up a 3-point shot into the trash.
3,Liked it until the end,"Here I am, listening to a really good book on tape, when what happens? It wraps everything up and ends in about 30 seconds of time. I fumbled around thinking my iPod had malfunctioned, but no... they were saying ""we hope you have enjoyed...blah blah"". I've never seen such an abrubt and unsatisfying ending in the hundreds and hundreds of books I've read. If another book is forthcoming, I'll be a little molified, but not much."
4,I think it was ok.,"Yo sup peeps. I bought this album and i thought it was alright. The lyrics are amazing thats for sure. The only thing that i had a problem with this album was some of the beats, some of them were strange, like strange fruit lol, but i still thought that it was a decent album. If your a lyrics kinda person then check this out, Peace"
1,Ford Explorer 91-01 Haynes Manual,"Very poor quality. Faint printing on re-cycled toilet paper. I bought it to do some work on the transmission, when I got to the section I needed, the manual stated that it was complicated and the reader should take the transmission to a trans shop. Waste of money."
3,Disappointment,Thought I was purchasing the same book I checked out of the library. Was disappointed that their were no diagrams in the book. otherwise a good reference manual.
5,Another awesome Haynes Repair Manual,"Haynes Repair Manual's are the only books you'll ever need for your vehicle, and this one is just as useful. I couldn't live without this book. Even though I hardly ever needed it, it was a god send when I did. Stuck on the side of the road with no idea why? This is the book that might just help you out..."
3,Not overly impressed,"I bought this for my 5 year old daughter because of the price (cheap, disposable). It doesn't work well on grass or uneven surfaces (low ground clearance). It doesn't turn well at all (the front wheels flip over instead of actually turning). It has one speed -- pretty fast. The range on the remote control isn't very good either. It's difficult to maneuver since there is no ""right/left"" because the toy can operate right-side up or upside-down. This gets confusing even for an adult and with the speed, can be rather reckless.I bought it to be a cheap, disposable toy and it has proven to be cheap and will be disposable. Since I only paid $13 or so for it, I can't really expect anything more than what I got. For the price, it's ""decent"". It's not the great deal I was hoping for, but the money wasn't wasted either."
4,Still makes a girl laugh,"Romantic Comedy that ends with everything sorted out and people will just go about being happy? Well I always have a hard time accepting that idea when a character is as over the top and flakey as Bridget.But Helen Fielding is just so good at the confused, over-thinking character going about the day to day of their life. It helps of course that this plot is mostly lifted from Jan Austen's Pride and Prejudice."
3,"Nice read, but nothing special","Nice read, but there's not much to say. I ended comparing this to the movie nonstop, since I've watched the movie like million and one times! And I must admit, both have pros and cons. Book had less embarrassing moments, when the movie was filled with embarrassment. But the movie had more scenes with Darcy and Daniel, which I missed in the book.I think I like the movie better, since I'm going to watch it yet again this Christmas (because you just have to watch it when it's Christmas!), but I don't see myself reading this again.Oh, and I was all confused when there was all this talk about answering machines etc.! Then I had to check out when this came out, and realized I was only about 10 years old back then, and cellphones came few years later, so no wonder they didn't have cellphones..But huge plus for the fact that this was written ages ago, yet still didn't feel outdated. Except for the part about answering machines.Love,Monaliz @ Mind Reading?"
4,Bridgets funner in Print!,"I ordered this book along time ago and have been reading bits and peices of it here and there..Its a nice little fluff read..Kinda like peeking in your naughty sisters Diary! I thought the movie was cute,But the book is so much Cuter and Bridget is a bit brighter than they make her out to be on Screen.Its really a fun fun book.I'm glad I read it and would recommend it for fans of the movie or those just looking for a nice easy read!"
3,"Read Angus, Thongs and Full Frontal Snogging instead","I'm glad I read Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging before reading Bridget Jones's Diary. The parody is far more entertaining the National Bestseller. Where I could relate to Georgia and laugh at her 14 year old views of the world and dating, Bridget as a 30ish naive diary writer comes off as self obsessed and pathetic."
3,Oh no! Im thirty and single!,"This book was an easy, entertaining read, a diary (duh) of Bridget Jones' everyday life as a raging Singleton living in London.She starts off each entry with a record of her current weight, calories and the number of times she has pined over some guy. She is a good-natured pommy lass, really likeable!Nothing really happens, per se, it's more just a chance to get to know this funny and absorbing character, to relate to her weaknesses and laugh at her misfortunes. She is confused, and not quite grown up. As a result of her state of disarray, she is not about to tie up the loose ends of the story for you. Oh well."
3,"Entertaining, but somewhat annoying at times","Although I found the story to be somewhat entertaining and the witty remarks rather unique, I was thoroughly annoyed by the self-pitying theme. I am not very tolerant of women who have a low self esteem and don't wish to improve themselves by any other way than losing weight or counting cigarettes. So, needless to say, the calorie counting banter was not my cup of tea. Bridget did get a little more self sufficient by the end of the novel, even though the dependence on male interactions was still apparent, so I calmly dealt with her until the end. So, it is not the best book I have ever read, but it is somewhat entertaining."
3,NOT THAT BAD,"The book is quite enjoyable and funny. Altough I am a believer of exagerrated characters/incidences in fiction, this booked was too much based on cartoon creatures. It is weird but I couldn't help recalling Jerry Lewis in some of the scenes..Anyway, it is a good book after a hectic week."
5,Great Fun and Easy Read!,I really enjoyed reading about Bridget Jones....also the weekly newspaper column written by Fielding (available online). I think that both men and women will enjoy the humor of this book. I look forward to more books that depict the stuggles of women and relationships!
4,"Witty, hilarious, hits close to home - a real best seller","I just finished reading this book and found it to be absolutely hilarious. Helen Fielding really knows how to hit home. Any unmarried female in her 30s can definately relate to the problems that Bridget encounters in her love life, her professional life (which in her case tends to intertwine) and her relationships with her mother and married friends. I felt that many of the thoughts that Bridget had mirrored my own. This book was wonderful with a heartful ending. Enjoy."
4,definitely entertaining but...,"I enjoyed this book but didn't find myself laughing out loud. I found some of the British terms confusing; however, eventually figured out what the definitions were (too bad there wasn't a small glossary of terms in the back for us non-Brits). Overall it was entertaining and a quick read."
4,What a refreshing time-out from real life!,"I swallowed this book in a few, delightful hours, laughing out loud and thoroughly enjoying my brief escape from reality. Surely, there is a bit of Bridget Jones in all of us. (In my case, quite a lot.) I haven't seen my actual copy of the book for weeks because it is making the rounds of all the women I know. Let's face it, we all could use a good laugh! Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to tally my fat calories......."
4,the perfect anti-hero,"i am from Venezuela,35,married,with children,thin,non-smoker,social drinker and I don't have to work,so you may say that i'm more a Magda than a Bridget,but I still felt deep in my heart very much like a Bridget.Her sense of humor,her insecurities,her ups and downs makes her the perfect anti-hero wich I sometimes feel myself to be(And I think i'm not alone).My only problem with the book is a cultural one:Who are Douglas Hurd,Michael Howard and Jim Davidson? What kind of party is a Tart and Vicar? There are many elements of british pop culture that are lost to non-british citizens.Maybe because it wasn't meant to be read by a venezuelan who can hardly write in english,but still loved the book."
3,What a hoot!,"No, Bridget is not representative of all single women in their thirties. No, this isn't one of those stream of consciousness yawns that some people think of as literature (thank heavens). Rather this is a wink and grin portrait of life in the 90's and of all the silly, stupid, ridiculous things we do when trying to manage our daily existence. If you can laugh at yourself, you'll get a kick out of it. If you can't, you'd better pass."
5,"If I had a bit more inner poise, I could almost BE Bridget !","I was on a plane from Helsinki to London, after a miserable holiday, and the woman sitting next to me (after kindly listening to my blubbering and whingeing) said 'I think there's a book you might like.'. The bookstores at London Airport had lots of copies of the book, and I figured why not. I can only say that I laughed so much, I can't think of a better time EVER. Helen Fielding has a deft touch, and has managed to zero in on 99.9% of The Modern Women's Concerns. I keep the book on my bedside table, and just have a leaf through it every so often - partly for the pleasure of the writing, and partly to re-identify with Bridget. Listen, if Nick Hornby liked it, it's got to be good. And it is."
3,not as great as they say -- only okay.,"I was really looking forward to this book thinking I'd be laughing non-stop as I had been for Divine Secrests of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood -- but I felt let down. Maybe I just get British humor, but this book is not very funny. Bridget is insecure and pathetic -- I just wanted to tell her to get a life and stop obsessing! But I did like this book because it's a fast easy read -- perfect for the summer! A no-brainer. And I could relate to Bridget on some level. But, I certainly couldn't be her friend -- her insecurity would drive me batty!"
2,Junk food for the brain,"I read this book in two evenings. Such garbage. It scares me to see how many other reviewers could relate to Bridget's life! I HAD to read it for my book discussion group. It's appeal is limited to those who, like Bridget, are completely self-centered and oblivious to the real problems of our times. The book's only merit is as an escape from reality."
2,What a loser!!,"Amidst all the hype about this Singleton whom I could supposedly relate to, I was horrified to read about a sloppy, self- pitying, disorganized, undisciplined, weight-obsessed female. She only confirms to male chauvinists that women cannot quite take care of themselves and get over-emotional and neurotic over everything else. I definitely don't admire Bridget Jones. She does more a disservice to my gender than a funny look at ourselves. What a piteous loser. Only consolation is that it is a quick read."
2,Not Worth the Hype,"After reading rave reviews of this book, I was very disappointed. (Especially that I bought it in hardcover!!!) It reads like an article out of ""Seventeen"" magazine. Who cares how many cigarettes she smoked and how much weight she lost or gained....or lost....or gained....??? It was funny in the beginning, but tedious as it went on....and on...and on. If this book can get published than I should send my journals to Viking and make a million bucks. My life is far more interesting. On the plus side...there are some funny bits and the prose flows nicely. I wasn't bored reading it, but I can't say I was disappointed when I finished it."
2,The movie may be better than the book,"After hearing so much about this book, I couldn't wait to read it. However, I must say that I was disappointed. The story is entertaining, albeit a bit far-fetched. The style is not quite like a diary. In fact, it's almost like a knock-off of the Adrian Mole Diaries (which are far superior). The jacket said that is being made into a film by the people who made ""Four Weddings and a Funeral."" I think that the story might be better in that format."
2,Didn't live up to its press unfortunately,"Such a disappointment. I thought, at first, that the reason this book was not funny to me was because ""it lost something in the translation"". Or, maybe because I'm a ""smug married"". I did like the diary format and even though I am far from being in my 30's, I enjoyed some of Bridgit's experiences (alas, few and far between). This is a good ""beach reading book"" since it is quick and easy to follow but unfortunately doesn't have much substance. I don't have much contact with 30-something females of today, but I surely hope they are not like Bridgit!"
4,I AM BRIDGET JONES!!!,"I loved this book because it shows me I AM NOT UNIQUE. My angst is shared -- what a relief! As a thirty-something single, I could have written each and every page (indeed, my journal probably reads a lot like this book!!) I found Bridget Jones' Diary during a trip to London -- it is all over the shelves there. Do yourself a favor and read it, particularly if you're a single woman. Just like ""The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood"", this is a book I am insisting my best female buddies read."
5,Exceptionally poignant for the 30 something career woman,"This book hilariously exposes the foibles of the 30 something career girl, who is decidedly single, and with no prospect of marriage on the horizon, (inspite of what parents and all those ""aunts and uncles"" have to say on the subject.) Incredibly British style humor (I do hope that it translates to American), but as a Brit living in the States for the last 10 years, it brought home all of those high-powered career days of the '80's that weren't quite what they were cracked up to be. Parts of this book had me laughing out loud, as Bridget describes with almost excrutiating honesty, both the good and the bad about being 30 something and still single. A really entertaining read."
5,Hilarious book (and i'm a man),This is one of the funniest books i've read even though i'm a man. Anyone who is depressed about themselves should read this. Brilliant.
3,"Like a bad sitcom, Bridget continues",A book filled with gimmicks. Supposedly the female eqivalent to HIGH FIDELITY (but never reaching as far as Hornby's witty prose)Bridget is a one-liner carried through a hundred or so pages. Must lose weight. Must find a man. Must find a brain! Ever wonder what the cheerleaders you went to high school with were doing? Bridget's a good update. Mildly funny.
1,"bridget, get over yourself","I find it disturbing that so many people seem to ""identify"" with Bridget's life. If you're neurotic, insecure, self-centered and nasty then it really is no wonder you can't find a mate. Trees are far too valuable to be wasted on this nonsense."
1,"If you're in your 40s, this will depress you beyond belief.","This is, quite simply, a sad little book. To think that this book is being touted as ""humorous"" or as a representing ""what every woman thinks"" is truly amazing in this day and age. In a nutshell Bridget is a twit and quite stupid. The only thing that makes you feel sympathy for her is that she is an alcoholic---a problem which neither she nor the author seem to acknowledge on any level, unless that is, the author thought this was screamingly funny. I was compelled to finish it in the same way one watches a bad TV movie. Perhaps it will appeal to people in their twenties, but the question is, why????"
1,PLEASE!,"Perhaps I am not as open minded to the behaviours of single woman. But this can't be true, I think, since I am one of these ""single women"". I read this years ago, before the hype of the movie, etc. And I was thoroughly disgusted with Bridget's behaviour and priorities. Is this how society views us unmarried women? I hope maybe this is not really true. Please tell me so!! Do yourself a favor and skip this one."
2,Some of us in Blightly don't care that we're single!,"Bridget's discomfort in the company of `smug marrieds' is something I can relate to, as a single woman myself. But while I tend to tell these people to mind their own, Bridget gets dragged down by what she so evidently feels is a failing of hers - that she doesn't have a boyfriend. Although I appreciate that relationships are important, it irritates me that this capable young woman doesn't get on with her life and stop making it such a feature. I do think Helen Fielding did a good job with the structure of this book. But the fact that it's been such a hit must surely say that so many young women are also at home with a bottle of white whingeing about being single, instead of doing things that would get them more of a social life (and perchance a fella!). I for one wouldn't chase Bridget if I were a man - I'd feel that I could just about anyone under forty and it would be a turn-off."
4,Fun Read..and frightfully true!!!,This book reflects the best and worst of modern day society...Great fun...written with tremendous humor and wit
3,This book is a hysterical look at the single womans lot.,"I loved this book. Bridget Jones is a single woman in her thirty somethings who is mildly successful careerwise but struggles with her love life somewhat. I love the way that this book demonstrates that to be a single woman these days means that your business is everyone elses. Great read. I felt that it could drag on a bit in some places and that there was the cliche of the female who could not cope without her male gay friend. I feel that this is an overdone theme in books, TV and movies at the moment."
5,Hilarious,"This is one of the best books I've read in quite a while. It does have a touch of the trashiness that can be found in books by Steel, Rice, and even Grisham, but by no means is this book like another title in the back. This is a really LOL book."
4,A real hoot.,"A funny book that made me thankful I'm not like that poor girl Bridget Jones. What a victim. but that's what makes her so funny, right?Too bad the really funny lines like ""machinery and pheasants in head"" (hilarious) and ""worry bead"" (riotous) will be lost in the translation to cheesy, wanna-be-full-of-charm film. The true amusement lay in the insightful contextual metaphors.Kept me smiling with a touch of aspartame."
3,OK book to pass time,"This was enjoyable, and an ok book to pass the time, but it isnt one of those suspensful, cant-put-down books. It is very British..meaning if you are not familiar with british slang and geography, you are better off renting the movie.Everyone has a Bridget Jones in their lives.. someone who is neurotic, insecure and compulsive. So it is easy to relate to her and you will find your self rooting for her to succeed. It has a handful of good laughs and it is written well. Personally I would rather read a book that makes you turn the pages and cant wait to see how it ends. This is not one of them."
1,This review goes to zero,"Let's say you're reading a book. You've given the plot a one, characters a one, prose a one ... but the book is really worse than that. You need that extra bit, that extra push over the cliff. Where do you go from there? Zero.""But why not just make one lower, and give the book a one?""This review goes to zero."
1,What is the big deal about?,I really did not understand why this book was such a huge hit. I have seen the movie and found it entertaining. Lighthearted and funny. But I could not enjoy the book. I have no problem with the concept of a 30 something spinster looking for love and bliss. It is an issue that is becoming more relevant in this day and age. But the writing was so commonplace. I could not discern real literary talent here. No craftsmanship in the way emotions are dissected and presented. Its an ordinary diary filled with trite sentences detailing what she eat and drank in a day and how many cigarettes she smoked! Din't make an impact on me!
3,"Simply Written, but Endearing","This is one of the most simple novels out there, but the characters are endearing. Nuff said. It's a no-brainer and a quick read."
2,you may like it if single and hate your life,"Frustrated single white female, very negative attitude, looking for love, drinks too much, weight obsessed even though is already thin, trying to quit smoking, hates her career. That is it in a nutshell. I might have loved this book when I was single and so negative but now that I am a happily married mother, and have experienced a great and happy career, I was bored rather than entertained. Couldn't identify with the character. Kept thinking ""get a life"" and ""she is so shallow"". Boring! Novel dragged on with much of the same material over and over, not so much drama and not anything very surprising happens to shake up the boring-ness of it all."
2,Bridget Jones Diary,"The book was a little more used than I anticipated, but I still enjoyed reading it again."
2,what a drag,"Ok, the only reason I read this was because I love Pride and Predjucice. This book was awful, and depressing. Not funny. Her life just made my sad, and her family is just pathetic. Was it meant to be funny? Ending was really abrupt and hurried, and I kind of wondered how I even got to the end. Got so sick of hearing how many cigarrettes she had smoked, how many drinks, how many calories. Oh my goodness. Enough!"
2,VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!,"After falling in love with the movie,I was really looking forward to the book,especially since I heard a lot of people saying that the book was much better than the movie.And I was really disappointed by the book.It's really boring!!!The Bridget in the book is a shallow,neurotic,self-envolved person and it's is really hard to empasize with her.She goes on and on about her problems,which are really small and unimportant that it's really annoying and tiresome to continue the reading.And I don't think the book is funny at all.What supposed to be funny,the fact that she weights herself every 30 min?Or that she knows nothing about anything and working in the publishing firm never read a book,except for the sex manual?It's amazing that out of all this boring material the movie came out so interesting and kind and funny.Instead of reading a book I would recommend to rent a movie and then wait for a sequel."
2,I read this after my daughter finished with it,"I can't help but think a big joke has been played on the reading public. A simplistic modern farce, yes, funny in parts too, but it's filled with talk-show content. Not very substantial."
2,[Bad],"I can't be the only one who found this book-and Bridget-to be [bad]. I wanted to get her an AA brochure and a cat, and tell her that her life doesn't have to revolve around a man. Ick."
1,Reading this book made me ashamed to be a woman.,"I find it utterly terrifying that some many people claim to be able to identify with Bridget Jones or are ""just like her!"" Plowing through the tedium that is her life is downright painful. I hated every character in the book and only read to the end in the secret hope that everyone dies in a freak dinner party accident- instead, I was tortured with the most contrived ending ever written."
1,Like eating an entire bag of Cheetos....,"..you regret it every time! Heavy reliance on ethnic stereotypes (the oversexed Latin lover -- please!). My analysis is: ""nutritional content, zero; fat content, gazillion cals. Ugh. Resolve to do better!"""
1,Pathetic!,"Call me crazy but i didn't get this one. i am in my late twenties and dont see marriage in the near (or distant, for that matter) future so i thought id be able to relate to this one. Boy was I wrong! By the end of the novel I wanted to strangle Bridget AND the author. Ive never read of a more pathetic existence. I kept thinking that the ""main idea"" (think English class 8th grade) was that without a man, youre nothing. Do all of the readers who LOVED this one agree with that? that all women think about is men and calories? get real! the one thing this book did for me was make me feel good about myself becuase i DONT worry about those things constantly. If women genuinely resonated with this one, we've got some prioritizing to do."
4,Hysterical! This book will brighten anyone's day!,I couldn't put this book down! It was great fun to read and I highly recommend to women and men who want to understand the annoying things about being a woman!
4,"Funny, excessive, but to long...","I'm German and we had to read this book in school. Of course it was a great change to Shakespeare Sonnets and dramas (which I actually liked a lot!) Tomorrow I will probably write my graduation test on BJD... Well, what I want to say is straight and simple. This is a great, and amusing book, which is worth reading it by all sexes, of all ages (starting at 16). Of course the figueres are clichés, but that's what so hilarious about the diary. It reminded me of a show called AllyMacBeal - I think it's pretty popular over in the states. There are just two negative aspects I would like to comment on: first the lenght...it's a bit 2 long...and second (and that's why it's too long) it's too transparent and clear. From the first time B. meets Marc, everyone knew that he will be 'the right man!' Okay that's it. Thank you."
3,"Entertaining, easy, light reading for 20 somethings.","I must admit that this was not my most favorite book, but I was compelled to finish it. I thought the overall story was good, but found the line items about her weight & cigerettes & alcohol distracting. The ""smug marrieds"" in my book club didn't think it was funny, but secretly...Not too long ago I could relate to some of what the character experienced, but who wants to admit to feeling pathetic about not being married! (Thank God I'm engaged!)"
5,Entertainingly funny look at singledom,"Bridget is me. She is surrounded by her friends, family and boyfriends. All are idenifiable characters from any single woman's life. The men she falls in love with, the friends she puts up with all lend themselves to a rich tapestry which is fun to read about. It is very entertaining how the whole world, in her eyes, is divided into those who are single and those who have a significant other. Bottom line-it is sooooooooo funny."
4,Outrageous...hilarious,This book was very very funny. Great wit...Outrageous is the word that comes to mind to describe it.This IS being single
5,Beverage out your nose funny,"Before reading this comic masterpiece, I'd thought the movie funny. Compared to the book, the film is about as humourous as Schindler's List.Bridget's low self-esteem, parental and relationship issues are instantly relatable and told in such a witty way that I found myself bursting out with laughter while reading it.Beware of drinking hot beverages while reading this gem, as poorly timed laughter may cause them to spew forth from our nose!"
2,Mindless drivel,"I purchased this book a while back, but can't say that I'm a proud owner. When I first read the book it didn't seem so brainless, but the second time around, I couldn't fathom how such brain-stunting material could have spawned almost an entire new breed of ""women's novels."""
2,Coudn't relate to Bridget,"Thought this book was very trite. Bridget is the epitomy of the women today who are falling victim to the ""media view"" of what you should be like. To begin each day evaluating your self worth by how much you weigh, how many lottery tickets you purchased, etc. Get over it! Found it hard to get emotionally involved with the characters in this book."
5,Calling all girly girls...,"I loved this book! This is one of those, I just got dumped and all boys suck, kind of reads. You need a glass of wine, chocolate, and your favorite blanket to read this one. Made me proud to be a strong, independent, beautiful woman. Bridget goes through so many life altering experiences, all the while making sure she counts her calories. Hilarious! I highly recommend every woman between 18 and 35 read this immediately!"
2,A Bad Representation of Women in their early 30's,"After hearing how funny and true to life this book was, I could hardly wait to read it. Instead I plodded through 271 diary pages of perhaps one of the most shallow characters out there. All that is important in her life is her weight (which she checks daily), her alcohol, cigarette and calorie intake and the number of times a day she checks the answering machine. I think perhaps the term ""get a life"" was inspired by Bridget. What a horrible representation of single women in their late 20's/early 30's as being self-obsessed and weak spirited. I'm sure the reason this book is a bestseller is because there's undoubtedly sections that every woman identifies with in some way, which makes an even more dismal statement on our society. Perhaps Bridget should take up some volunteer work and develop some inner beauty."
1,I hated this book!!!,"I can't understand what all the hype is over this book. This is probably one of the worse books I've ever had the misfortune to attempt reading. It was so bad, I couldn't even finish it. This character is boring, whiny and sickening that I wanted to smother myself with the nearest pillow to stop from reading this book. The only reason why I gave this book one star is because you can't give less than that. Take my advice - steer clear of this book."
3,Silly but funny,"V.g. I recommended this book to all my friends; perfect for a nice, quiet afternoon, although if you are that kind of person that can't put up with other people's constant blundering, don't read it, it will only get on your nerves."
2,"For a 56 yr. old , no way!!! For a 25 yr old, prob. dynamit","First, I agree with so many of the reviews!!! Vapid, hollow, etc. But, I think the thing that bothered me most was the use of the word ""shag"" or ""shagged"". I know the Austin Powers movie has made it a popular euphomism, but isn't it just another word for ""F---""??? Are we going to replace ""F---"" with ""shag"" as an OK thing to say!!! See, I've already said it!! I guess so!!! I am by no means a prude, but I suppose this dumb, vapid so called ""Diary"" is better left to the younger crowd!!! And god knows, I hope they don't follow suit!!!!"
2,Disappointing,"I heard about this book on public radio and read about it, from that I expected it to be something I'd like. But as a American who fits Bridget's demographic profile perfectly (except for the nationality!), I was dismayed. It just wasn't funny to me. Bridget Jones reads like an The Patty Duke Show--twin cousins, one English, one named Ally McBeal, working as a lawyer in Boston. It is disheartening to find women my age so weak, obsessed with men and looks, and only able live life relative to what others think of how they look, act, etc. Bridget Jones annoyed the hell out of me. Viva la Feminism!"
2,"Book Got Tremendous Hype, but totally disappointing!","Had heard about this book and was very anxious to read it but I was totally disappointed. I felt that the book was not well written and I love ""diary-type"" books. Bridget was a very shallow individual and I could not get a grip on her personality. What a put-down to women...like do we only think of weight (of course we do, but not to such an extreme), men and pleasing ourselves? ""Diary"" doesn't have any substance to it....disappointing!"
2,Puh - lease,"This overhyped novel seemed somehow familiar to me, when I suddenly realized that it was merely a much much longer prose riff on the Waitresses' ""Cristmas Wrapping"" song from the early 80's (listen, you'll agree). Save yourself the anxiety brought on by reading the book and go listen to the song.P.S. Any book that suggests that a medium height woman at 130 pounds is overweight, should be nominated for an Annie B.(the award given to cultural images that cause eating disorders in young women and girls). Sick."
3,It's fanatical and hilariously funny...,"My God! Bridget Jones, a life of a women traced into a steps of mirror, we are actually following a woman of the nineties? I believe women ay shrugged but it is, so stereotypical! They are the anti-tradition, they are the new hip-hop and sex crazy Goddess... My...my Bridget Jones really brightens up my day with the humour cast upon the creative skills of Helen Fieldings, well, this is a shot of good book, I call this a great book not a literary exceptional book, a good thought for a life of laughter..."
5,The funniest and most clever book to come along in years,"This book is hysterical. I couldn't put this book down and re-read it all the time. Many of us can see parts of ourselves in Bridget which makes our own lives seem less overwhelming. After reading Bridget Jones's Diary, I found humor in black opaque tights and consolation about a doomed office romance."
3,OK,"A diversion for the beach, but it can't begin to touch the romance in The Triumph and the Glory or even Under the Boardwalk."
4,It helps to be well-read.,"What an amusing book! Even those who haven't read _Pride and Prejudice_ or _Tom Jones_ can appreciate the ridiculous situations and chasms of self-doubt that Bridget jumps into. But, oh my! For those of us who have read those old standy-bys, this book is delicious. Of course, Miss Elizabeth Bennett handles herself with more aplomb than Bridget, but the outcome is a given; it's the working out of the details that kept me entralled. Hurrah! a most enjoyable read!"
5,Much Better than the Movie,"I saw the movie this week when it came out and was mildly amused. But after hearing so much about Bridget Jones, I thought that there had to be more to it, so I bought the book and read it in two days. The book is fantastic. Bridget Jones is such a memorable character who is likeable and familiar. I could relate so much to her trials and tribulations (either through first hand experience or things my girlfriends have been through). Bridget Jones is every singleton woman wrapped in one. Yet as familiar as she is, Ms. Fielding has created an entirely unique character in Bridget. I can't wait to read Edge of Reason next. For singletons out there, I would also highly recommend In The Drink and Fried Calamari (two well worthwhile books that are as funny as they are insightful)."
2,Did I read a different book?,"I thoroughly was bored by this book. There was little insight involved in constructing this narrative. I felt like i was reading someone's diary who was too obsessed with the typical, mundane conception of what it is to be a woman. If you need to reassure yourself that you have the same neuorses as other women then go ahead pick this book up, but if you are a woman who doesnt define yourself by a physical description nor by what society and magazines dictate then DONT BOTHER."
1,"Contrived, shallow and predictable.","I for one will not be at all surprised if I read one day that Helen Fielding is the pseudonym for a shrewd but misogynistic male writer. It's a clever bit of marketing, though. It aims at the same areas that the supermarket magazines for women also aim at. The title character, Bridget Jones, seems to care only about her weight and getting a man while she's in her 30s and (phew) still young enough to have children. I say it wouldn't surprise me if a man wrote this book, because Bridget seems a composite of all the answers in magazine quizzes: ""I think my thighs are (a) Just Right (b) Horrid, (c) Illegally Huge"", etc. All the writer would have to do is buy a few magazines at the supermarket checkout counter. Voila -- instant character development. I notice I'm in the minority with a negative review...I'm not surprised, just saddened."
1,-5 star rating should be made for this book!,"Who wants to read about a thirty something woman whining about gaining a pound? Not me! Bridget was not an original character, nor was she a strong one. I had gotten to around page fifty when I could not make myself read another word of it. I took the book back. A book may not need to be a revelation of the human psyche, but if it's going to be this bad, it could at least be funny! Maybe then I wouldn't laugh at how poorly it's written."
2,A Boring Diary by a Neurotic Woman,"I'm sorry, but I don't know what all the hype is about with this book! A better title would have been 'Diary of an Alcoholic', because it's clear that Bridget seems to have some kind of a drinking problem. I didn't find this book that funny, just boring. I couldn't relate to Bridget at all--she doesn't remind me of myself or any of my friends, with her stupid weight obsessions and other neurotic qualities. I bought it expecting it to be sort of a High Fidelity for women, but it just wasn't that funny! I'm disappointed I wasted my money on this. (And embarrassed to be a woman if this is how we are.)"
3,Overall C+,"Beginning Hilarious...Middle Boring...End PitifulWanted to read this book for a long time and after watching the movie, I figured it would be a good time to read it. The beginning was hilarious, the intimate details of Bridget's life and her wild imagination made it seem very funny at first. But after a while, I started to lose interest. She repeats the same patterns in her life, ends up writing drinken diary entries that make no sense, ends up with the unexpected guy but is still doing the same old thing just with a new fella. By the middle, I wanted to be done with the book, but felt I had to finish."
4,"GOOD, Depends what you like","If you want a quick light read, then read this. Bridget Jones, as one of the worlds dizziest bimbos, get herself wrapped up in some hilarious situations that will make you chuckle. Everything which has the cliche ""Typical woman"" has been highly exaggerated creating a funny read at a desperate woman."
5,Vg start to day...,"I had read the book but listening to it on tape was vg fun. Each time I read it, listen to it, or watch it I can't wait to see what happens next, as if it would magically change. So funny!"
2,20th Century Neuroses,"Bridget Jones is your typical 30-something single woman in any large city around the world. At least that's what Helen Fielding would like us to believe. The truth is Bridget Jones is certainly an atypical 30-something single female from a ""comfortable"" background with a good job, in publishing as it happens, and all the attendant middle-class hangups about her physical size and what people think about her.If you are not part of this ""clique"" and you just know that she went to a public school and not the local comprehensive, then this book may well leave you cold. The only bits that will ring true are the getting righteiusly plastered with girlfriends whilst setting the world to rights and bemoaning all men as having far too much ""emotional f***wittage"".Frankly this book fitted a time and a place that just doesn't exist any more for most of the world's population. It passes a rainy afternoon but that is about all that can be said for it."
2,Very boring,"I definitely did not like both books about Bridget Jones. Annoying and boring. Somehow you will feel how hard the author tried to make up something funny, but it turns to be quite overdone. I would recommend Kinsella's books for a fun reading."
1,Oh please.,"It took me close to forever to get through this book. Friends told me ""You just don't get it"". I get it Bridget Jones is one of the most negative people I have ever encountered. Maybe it is the ""English"" humor. Whatever it is you can't escape the lack of a real plot. There is nothing to sink you teeth into, no action."
5,"A fun, anytime read.","Upon picking up this book, I was amazed at the bluntness of Bridget Jones' thoughts and expressions! The girl doesn't mix and match her words! I love the style it's written in,a dairy format always gives a novel a personal feel. If you're looking for a fun, straight-up read, this book satisfies without being deeply profound. (Thank God, we have way to many of those on the bookshelves, so much for a 'profound' novelty!)"
4,(v.g),"Bridget is quirky, neurotic and v. funny! Oh - and slightly obsessive. ChuhI love Helen Fielding's style of writing. (v. clever)Bridget seems to be a v. real girl with troubles most of us can relate to. I'm a married (however, not smug) and I can still relate to Bridget because I am also somewhat neurotic and obsessive. (Should I have admitted that?) HuhI keep a journal myself and have often gone back to see what I was up to earlier. (v. interesting and sometimes v. sad!)One of the best things about Bridget is the way she bounces back from disappointments. (I'm envious)I have yet to see the movie, but I am eager to because I can totally see Renee Zellwiger as Bridget! Looking forward!I recommend this book if you are looking for some light and interesting reading and some laughs too!"
3,It made a great film...,"I think I made the mistake of watching the film first, and therefore I was expecting to read the scenes that had made me laugh so hard in the film.If you are like me, then you might just be dissapointed because the book is quite different, and most of the things that happen in the film do not happen in the book.Having said that, the book is in my opinion fresh, funny in some parts and definetly a light and easy read. The characters are not totally believable, but you can still picture them quite well.As for Bridget.... I just kept wondering WHAT NOW?... there's a limit to how many stupid things a person can do... sometimes she made me laugh and I identified with her, but others I just felt pity....I put three stars because I admit I liked the film better, and it made me laugh a lot more than the book."
4,"Quotable, Funny!","Helen Fielding captures the world of the single 30-something person who is constantly questioned about the validity of existence without a ""significant other."" Relating to characters is very important to me when reading a book, and I saw pieces of myself, friends and family in many of the colorful characters. This was an easy read and thoroughly enjoyable. Looking forward to seeing what The Edge of Reason has in store for Bridget!"
5,Loved,"Admittedly, I watched the movie before reading the book, so I was a bit hesitant to purchase this and sit down to read it, but I am so happy I did. The book captures the true essence of Bridget, and I feel like I got to know her and the characters a lot more than in the movie. I laughed out loud a few times, which is rare for me while reading books!Even if you've seen the movie, it's still a great read."
4,One of my favorites!,"One of my all time favorite books, I own the hardcover version, and now put it on my Kindle as well. Makes me laugh out loud every time I read it, and I enjoy the ""diary"" style of the writing. Nice light, humerous book !"
4,Must avoid urge to describe as v.g....oops,"What can I say? This isn't exactly War and Peace but it is sweet, funny, and well-observed. Every woman should be able to relate to Bridget somehow. And if you are 32 and single like myself you'll wonder if Helen Fielding wrote the book about you. While some parts of the story will ring truer than others (does anyone really have a mother like this?) it's well worth the time to read. And at under 300 pages that's v. agreeable. (ARGH! I couldn't help myself)"
4,Finally made it to the top of the reading pile,"I gave in and decided to read Bridget Jones's Diary - finally. O.K. I admit I'm not in my thirties, and wasn't single in my thirties, don't live in London, so I simply can't relate to Bridget and her singleton friends. A number of my friends had recommended it, and thought that the book was hilarious. I found parts of the book rather humerous, and I loved her eccentric mother and her mid-life crisis. Although not the best book that I have read, it was moderately entertaining, a fast read, and worth the effort."
3,could do better,"Helen Fielding is clearly a very talented writer, and 'Bridget Jones' is a very entertaining read. I do suspect, though, and hope, that she has a better book in her. You sometimes feel when reading this that Fielding is not quite telling it like she wants to, and is holding back for some reason. I'm a big fan of Brit Lit, and while I would recommend this, I do think that there are much better books of this kind out there, like India Knight's 'My Life on a Plate'. It's hilarious, politically incorrect, intelligent, and unlike 'Bridget Jones', you really feel that Knight is saying everything that she wants to say. By comparison, fun and entertaining as 'Bridget Jones' is, it reads like only half the truth."
4,Hilarious and surprisingly touching.,"The heroine is as lovable as they come, and the story is always amusing as we watch poor Bridget blush again and again. Triumphant story of hopelessly vain Singleton, seeking to be self-assured and happy in an obstacle-course world of smugness. Makes you glad your life isn't as sad as hers, or if we're truly honest with ourselves, makes you glad you're not alone in your humiliations. Good for light, feel-good reading (summer)."
2,Not Great,"This book certainly had some funny parts, especially a pretentious cocktail party. But if you've ever read a ""Cathy"" comic strip, you've already read this book. Bridget indulges in constant insecure obsessing over weight, men, cigarettes, men, her job, men, her looks, and men. Tiresome, repetetive, and stereotypical -- in spite of entertaining moments, this book didn't end a moment too soon."
2,Disappointing,"I am very surprised that so many people loved this book. I found Bridget very pathetic and shallow. She is obsessed with counting cigarettes, alcoholic drinks, and calories every day?! Do people actually do this??? I had a very difficult time relating to her and it is rather disappointing that so many women could relate. On a positive note, there were some funny parts and it is easy summer reading."
2,Disappointed isn't the word.,"I just couldn't get with it. It had some funny moments, but overall I was very disappointed."
2,Predictably average summer read,"This book came highly recommended from a friend, and I was disappointed. I did laugh at some points, but found most of the book predictable and whiny. I personally thought ""Alice K's Guide to Life"" by Caroline Knapp did a better job of capturing the neurotic nature of the 30something single, female mind."
2,Amusing but inconsequential,"Very light reading. Good book for the beach, but will not find its place on my bookshelf of meaningful favorites."
2,good for a laugh but not great,"Even if there isn't a calorie- and man-obsessing Bridget Jones lurking inside you, I'm sure nearly everyone can relate to some aspect of the character's neurotic behavior and scenarios in this book (a match-making mother, dinner parties, white lies, gift-giving, etc). However, after about several months of diary, the italicized resolution calculations lost their novelty and the book generally failed to be an engaging page-turner. Though I'm a 30-year-old ""Singleton"" myself, I felt I was reading about a group of friends just out of college, a sort of St. Elmo's Fire for the 90s."
2,Who cares??,"Was given this book just in time for a beach holiday, and it turned out to be just right- fluffy, inconsequential, sloppily written. (and not proof read!) Fielding is funnier when she's musing about life in general than her own boring life, but overall she's tedious. Whilst I was reading this I happened to see an article in the Singapore edition of Elle Magazine, summing it up nicely: ""It's the sort of behaviour that's a given in your teens, an indulgence in your 20's and a downright watse of time in your 30's"". Quite- the book is a real mish mash of every female crisis, all happening to one woman at once. As the Elle article concluded: ""We've come a long way, baby, but Bridget Jones only takes us back. And some of us have been there, done that. It's time to move on"". Indeed..."
5,"The best book I've read all year--hilarious and ""true""","If I had to choose one word to describe this book, it would be ""brilliant."" I loved this book. Couldn't put it down. Laughed out loud trillions of times. Buy this book. You'll thank me!"
1,A ridiculous work of fiction,"I, too, was mislead by the Bestseller's List status of this book and foolishy bought it myself. I will admit that I enjoyed the first few chapters, but by the end I was disgusted. If I had wanted to read a Danielle Steel book, I would have bought one. Don't waste your time reading this book....it is a sheer disappointment. Oh, and the reviewer above who said that the author would not be receiving so many bad reviews were she a man....what a cop out! Bad writing is bad writing regardless of what's between your legs."
1,What a stupid book!,"Bridget Jones's Diary is a stupid waste of time. I was so disappointed because there has been so much good press about this book, but I found it to be shallow and insincere. Bridget is a total whiner and her mother is a terrible person. I wouldn't recommend that anyone read this trash."
2,One Word: Silly,"Helen Fielding is an incredibly gifted writer. There's no denying that. But this book is so overhyped it's not even funny. The storyline of a self-obsessed thirty-something (the book kindly hints that when you're in your thirties you're 'old') searching for a boyfriend and complaining about her weight is so boring, so unoriginal. Yeah, 130 pounds is terribly overweight, isn't it? This book makes women look like cry babies with nothing better to do than feel sorry for themselves. Worse yet, there's a sequel coming. Oh boy..."
2,Mildly amusing for the first 25 pages at best,"After the rave reviews I was looking forward to this one, but was sorely disappointed. The main character is a total stereotype--obsessed with finding a boyfriend, cigarettes, weight and chocolate--maybe in reverse order. Her job fills time she would otherwise spend eating and smoking. Why is it that no one writes books like this about guys? Portrayals of women like this aren't that funny to begin with, and this one wore thin quickly. Don't waste your time on the sequel--I didn't."
4,A mirror to all single women with a sense of humour,"Reading this book was like looking in the mirror, even if Bridget is more honest about her alcohol intake and her calories than I am. She does all the things we supposedly bright, intelligent, career-minded, smart girls do, including having an affair with Mr. Wrong and promising herself she will do better in the morning. The only reason that I do not give this book 5 stars is the ""happy"" end. Why is finding Mr. Right the solution to everything? I'd have preferred Bridget to buy her own house and have a 19-year old hunky student rent a room there. (by the way, the same applies to 'does my bum look big in this' by Arrabella Weir)"
3,Postfeminist units: 1000s (v. good? v. bad? your call),"At its worst, this is the comic strip Cathy, but with sex. At its best, it's wine-up-your-nose hilarious. Helen ain't Henry, and Bridget ain't Tom, but hey, who wants to haul 1,200 pages of literature to the beach? This is the quintessential summer read, friendly and forgettable."
3,Bridget needs to grow up,"For months I was anticipating sitting down with this book, and once I did, I have to admit I was a bit disappointed. Yes, it is very funny, yet I find Bridget's obsessions to be something I experienced during my teen-age years and early 20s. I'm now 34, and couldn't find a single issue of hers relevant to my own life now. I always believed that the Brits matured much sooner than we Americans. Now, I'm beginning to wonder. I wanted to say to Bridget, get over it. Move on. You're in your 30s; take responsibility for your own life. Especially, because it would be demeaning to finally find a man to take care of you for the rest of your life. We're approaching the new Millennium. We women are more independent now than we've ever been. Don't depend on a man for happiness. Find it within yourself. Create the life you want, than find a man to share it with. Otherwise you'd still be miserable. I just couldn't find this book funny. Only depressing and unenlightening."
4,amusing,This book is great for holiday reading.Once you started you can't stop.Bridget's story is really close to our own experierences with chocolate and cigarettes. Funny and amusing!!!
4,V.G. book,Bridget's look at life is refreshingly funny. You will fall on the ground with laughter from start to finish. This book has many bright points but especially funny is Bridget's mother. The only down parts are that a few of the plot twists are predictable. Even so this is a great read.
4,"pretty good, but....","...a bit of a let down as so many people had recommended it to me I was expecting the best thing since sliced bread! Having said that however, it was pretty good and I did laugh out loud a couple of times and get the forewarned strange looks on the tube!I'm only 24, but some of what BJ went on about rung true, like the weight which would appear from nowhere and the infatuation with a Daniel who funnily enough also works in my office!ha! ha! I wonder how accurate however the portrayal of finding your Darcy literally shoved in your face is???? answers on a postcard!!Good for you BJ who taught me if it'll happen then just bide your time - oh and also not to give dinner parties. Full stop, whether they be on work days/nights or weekends but to - Just call for the caterer darling, you know the caterer! the one who supplies you with all the food!!"
4,"Accept Bridget, warts and all!",Not since reading Kingsley Aims have I laughed out loud so much. Thank you Helen Fielding for creating such colorful characters. Reading Bridget's diary give a real sense of her moods and (yes) even her personal growth. How refreshing to read an honest story about a single woman without making her too pathetic or precious.
4,A Total Crack Up,"After moping around the house sick during the long-awaited 4-day weekend, I decided to get myself some reading to lift my depressed spirits. This book is just what the doctor ordered. ""Bridget"" is a very quick read; you can polish it off in a day easily and you'll be laughing out loud the entire time. I kept expecting the neighbors to drop by and say ""What are you doing in there?!""Sadly, this book rings true for too many females, regardless of age or nationality. Discontentment with work, men, body image, and family are obviously universal. Misery loves company and ""Bridget"" proves it. Nothing lifts the spirits like realizing that you're no more (or less) neurotic than most everyone else. ""The therapeutic value of a [reality check] is without parallel."" Buy this book!"
3,A modern classic,"This charming story of a talking rabbit and his adventures in the magic forest have rapidly become a modern classic. Kids everywhere will delight with the eccentric and colourful characters we meet along the way - especially Mr Frizzle the Walnut-Catcher! - although the plot is sometimes laboured, and the vocabulary a bit challenging for the 6-to-8-year-old reader. Nonetheless a bedtime treat. More please!"
3,Judy Blume meets Sex and the City,"If you grew up on Judy Blume, and have graduated to Sex and the City, you'll find this book very familiar. There's nothing new here, though."
3,"see the movie, skip the book","I never thought I would promote a movie over a book... but I can't help it. I read Bridget Jone's when it first came out, and found it fairly unthrilling. There was so much hype surrounding its humor, and I couldn't wait to laugh out loud. It struck me as man obsessed, and a bit dull. The movie, however, I adored! It was funny, and made Bridget seem more real and loveable. I must add in that I think what the media did in regards to Renee Zewelleger's weight was absoulutely despicable. She wasn't fat at all!"
3,Not what I expected,"Admittedly, I saw the movie before picking up the book. Maybe that's why I didn't get as much pleasure from it, I'm not sure. Don't get me wrong, it was a good book, but I guess just not what I expected. All I can honestly say is that I would rather watch the movie, which is one of my new favorites and I HIGHLY recommend. This book followed a slightly different storyline, which included less of Mark, who I wanted to see more of. The sequel (Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason), however, is hilarious. I am rereading it for the third time right now. But you do need too know the original story to fully appreciate it. Whether you do that through the movie or book is your choice."
2,Grown up female perspective of Adrian Mole,"I read the Secret Diary of Adrian Mole by Sue Townsend about 13 years ago, and found Bridget Jones's Diary to be remarkably similar. Swop the sexes around and substitute his measuring the size of his thingy for her constant weight watching and that's about it. I whizzed thorugh it in about a day, and found it very easy going, but felt that it's been done before."
2,Bridget Jones,"I saw the movie before I read the book. I didn't care for the movie. But everybody always seems to think that the books are better than the movies. So I read the book and was disappointed. I thought it was very slow and repetitive. Some scenes were over the top, like Bridget's mother and Julio. I am going to read the sequel since I already have the book. But this isn't a book I would recommend. I didn't bring me any emotion...I didn't laugh, I didn't cry...I just got bored and wanted to finish it."
2,I can't see what all the fuss is about,"I'm annoyed that I spent $1 to reserve this at the library. I had to force myself to finish it. If this is the sort of character that young women today relate to, I fear for our gender. To say that Bridget is shallow, sophmoric and simplistic would be an understatement.This book was supposed to be hilareous but I only managed a weak chuckle once near the end of the book. I gave it two stars because it is slightly better than the worst books I have ever read."
4,Hilarious!,"This book made me laugh at loud several times. Even though I'm well past the age of the main character, I could certainly identify with many of her predicaments. Every woman has been through some of these situations at some time in her life. I really enjoyed it as a good summer read."
5,Pride and Prejudice Remade,"The plot is the same...even down to the characterization of Mark Darcy (Mr. Darcy). Funny is an understatement of the glib, anxious, dotty personality depicted here. I love Bridget, although I think she has a few issues with alcohol, cigatrettes, sex, exercise, punctuality, etc....Loved it....Chick book? YES!"
5,BRILLIANT,This is a great book!!! VERY easy to read and EXTREMELY easy to identify with the main character - almost too close for comfort.
3,Ominous,"My mother is sending me books again (this one and Suzie Sexpert, as if those are my options). I got this one yesterday. I read this instead of eating for the last 24 hours, since it felt fitting. I'm a little younger and already divorced, but the story felt a little painful. I think she knows about the blog.A woman in her thirties playing a Jane Austen character (what my mom said; I don't know the book) eventually getting something, but the ending felt fake, like Helen Fielding added that because Austen would have done it and spinsters don't sell in any century. One of these days Kilgore is going to come back and find this on my shelf and leave all over again. I can't bring guys I'm dating back to the apartment with Bridget Jone's Diary in here somewhere, the pages rigid with coffee stains.Maybe Suzie Sexpert was a better option."
2,BBC top 100??,"I began reading this book as a result seeing the BBC's recommendation of the top 100 books. When seeing other books on the list, such as Tale of Two Cities and To Kill A Mockingbird, I was expecting great things. The book was amusing, yet I was disappointed in the morality level. This is not a book which should be on such a list of excellent literature. More like chick-lit, light, and all for fun reading."
1,"A shallow, pathetic look at career women in the nineties","This book is funny for about five minutes (and I'm being generous)... Bridget Jones is a classic example of a shallow, pathetic woman who views her career as a way to find a suitable husband, defines herself by who she sleeps with, how much she weighs, and sees parties as opportunities to get drunk. You keep hoping that she will see the light and start to grow up but she never does and the book never seems to end. So much more could have been done with this character, I expected a lot more..."
5,you read and you can't stop laughing!,"when I first read Bridget's diary I couldn't stop laughing. secound reading made me feel somehow emmbarresed - she's telling all of our little secrets in public! oh my god. now all the boys know.... and yet, I thank the day this book came in my way. what a joy!"
2,Just what the chauvinists have been trying to say...,"Sure, it's an interesting story, a page-turner at times, but I can't see how some people are so enthusiastic and can relate!!! It only shows how that women can only be happy once she finds a man, and, as the story goes, Bridget wastes the entire year searching for 'the perfect gu-uy' and grumbles about everything else. It sounds more like the diary of an immature sixteen year-old. By her thirties at this time and age, she should have been trying to achieve the 'Woman of the 90's' outlook, but she just transported us back to the 50's, when the utter desire of the average woman was to land a man and make babies. Most readers (and to think WOMEN!!!) were so ecstatic in saying 'this is THE woman of the 90's!' but it's more like a regression to the unliberated thinking of the 50's woman. To make it worse, she works through the diary having spontaneous sex. I suppose by the year 2000 she'd have probably contracted STD."
4,Close enough,"As a 30ish Singleton, I can safely say that there's a bit of Bridget in me and almost all of my friends. That doesn't mean I identify with her; she does some really stupid things and is tremendously lacking in true self confidence. But I do recognize her--for example, I like the way I look but keep obsessing over five pounds. It's just a lot funnier when Fielding tells it than when I do. This book is not an indictment of feminism, nor is it greatly insightful. But it is enjoyable and lighthearted--a good read for those who don't take themselves or their entertainment too seriously."
5,My favourite funny book,"This book is dead funny. If you have ever been single, are single and in your thirties you will suddenly see the funny side of life. It is hilarious!!!"
5,wow,"the brigdet jones's diary is so funny! It's really entertaining and Brigdet is such a mess. Every woman will identify with her at some point of her life (love life, cooking, work...). You will laugh out loud while reading her opinions on men,life, money,etc.,(based on every self-help book she has ever read), or about her family, and her mother's ""affair"".I recommend it to every woman on earth, married, single, divorcee... But what's most amazing is that vol.2 is even better & a lot funnier! READ'EM"
3,"Not Bad, but Disappointing!","After hearing many people rant and rave about how funny the book was or how hilarious or dramatic or how easy it was to relate to etc. I was very disappointed when I read it. I expected a fantastically brilliant piece of work but it seemed to be like every other book out there written in diary form. It was very average and the characters seemed a bit too unrealistic. There are much more funnier etc. ""diaries"" than this one. Even though those characters are also unrealistic, they still provided more entertainment."
3,"Funny but choppy, unrealistic, and rather meaningless","The structure created many of the problems. It's supposed to be a smooth story, but is supposed to also look like a diary. I didn't know exactly where the character was going, or that she was even trying to get any particular place. I also think she was a loser, one I found difficult to sympathize with. There were several unrealistic things happening, some of which contributed to the climax, thus the climax was not all that amazing to me.Also, there were many things in it that seemed British-specific and incomprehensible (like, who would care about a guy named Daniel Cleaver? He sounds like fish pate on spam.)"
2,Highly Derivative,"It's hard to understand all the brouhaha over this book! The story is Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"". The presentation as the-misadventures-of-the-comic-heroine was perfected over 20 years ago by Jilly Cooper. Jane Austen is better. Jilly Cooper is better. This would be one of the few cases I have seen where the movie is better than the book. And that's pretty darn sad."
2,could not relate to this book...,...even though I'm also a single woman in her 30s. Not all of us are that insecure. Bridget should get over it already. Some of us do have other things to worry besides weight and drinking too much (which I think is a serious problem). And none my married friends are anything like hers (thank God). Is this how society sees single women? Is this how I'm supposed to act...because I'm single?
3,Miss Elizabeth Bennet would never...,"Embarass herself the way Bridget Jones does. If you read it as a good story that has various homages to Pride & Prejudice contained in it, then it's fine, great, a plesant thing to read on the beach or on a plane (which is where I read it the first time). But if you read it for a full-fathom retelling of Austen's P&P, you won't get it. Clueless is closer to Emma, Cruel Intentions closer to Les Liasons Dangerous, but while BJD may be inspired by P&P, it's not close to it."
1,I Prefer Jane,"I was surpsied at how utterly pathetic Bridget is. I kept waiting for her to face her alcoholism. And I found the writing awkward. I guess leaving the subject out of the sentence is supposed to make it seem more like an actual diary, but I kept having to re-read to make sense of it. I understand that people like this book and hey! that's great for you. But if you DON'T like this book, try ""The Girls' Guide to Hunting and Fishing"" -- Jane is so much cooler than Bridget."
1,Pathetic,"Following the juvenile rantings of a thirty-year-old woman who is obsessed with her weight and lack of boyfriend hardly seems worth a place on any best-seller list. It is a sad commentary on the emotional and intellectual state of the ""average"" thirty-something woman that this book has done so well. Bridget is a pathetic character - insecure, unimginative, and borderline hysterical. And it's not even funny!"
3,Amusment gives way to Disdain,"#1 Bestseller in Britain, and it's easy to see why. This fictional diary of a 30ish single career woman in London reflects the all concerns and insecurities of her kind, in a breezy, witty, quick read that will not tax anyone in any way. Fielding's heroine's worries and dislikes are all fairly obvious, and her mistakes, while gently amusing, aren't particularly insightful. Her daily tallies of calories, alcohol units, cigarettes, lotto tickets, and so forth, are supposed to be a barometer to her inner self, which is mainly influenced by the progress of her love life. It starts off as amusing, but as the book progresses, Bridget gets more and more annoying in her self-pitying and general immaturity. I guess there are 30ish women like this in the world, but thankfully not among my friends."
3,Just another junk novel but somewhat amusing nonetheless...,"Admittedly the humor is slap-stick rather than intellectual and subtle, but it IS funny. A good quick read for periods between Lolita and Les Miserables."
5,A Single Girl's Handbook?,"Having read the Adrian Mole Diaries, I found this book to be entertaining and very true to life. Life imitates Art and vice versa! Bridget's neuroticisms are the same which draw us to Ally McBeal because they are so easy to relate to. I think everyone has experienced a situation where they have found themselves bouncing off the walls no matter how educated, well-rounded and confident they normally are. Let's face it, there are those people in life that just know how to push your buttons to insanity be they well-meaning parents, friends, or the stranger that walks through the door and makes you giggle for no aparant reason. Reading Bridget's misadventures is comforting and one wonders what my diary would look like if I kept one for a year. Hats off to BJ!"
5,Bridget Makes a Splash,"I read this book last summer and found it completely engrossing. For the most part, I felt that this book would appeal more to girls, seeing as it relates a lot of its stories to dieting and relationships. I enjoyed Fielding's writing style tremendously. She used a lot of shorthand (in a diary format), which was different for a change and made it easier for the reader to breeze through. However, the only parts I found distracting were the parts with British slang. For example, the term ""fag"" refers to a cigarette. Ha, that took me a while to figure out...Overall, I thought this book was a great summer read. I'd recommend it, along with Youth in Revolt by CD Payne."
5,Screamingly Funny,"I could not put this down and kept saying to myself: ""I am soooo Bridget!"". Then I settled down, got attached and am even thinking about getting a puppy - so now I delve into every once in a while to remind me about ""single life""! Seriously, though, this is a funny, quick, lighthearted and ultimately friendly read. Readers will either want to hug Bridget or strangle Bridget. Either way, you'll have an opinion and have a rollicking good time forming it!"
5,Absolutely Hilarious,"This book was simply marvelous. I am only 17 and I couldn't relate to probably half the stuff bridget went through, but I could not put the book down! This is the first time I have read a book and actually laughed out loud."
2,"Mildly diverting, but hyped to death","There's nothing inherently bad about this book if you take it as a light-hearted piece of entertainment. Nothing wrong with that; it isn't remotely realistic, it's stereotyped, it doesn't pretend to either originality or literacy (I hope!). I read it in the bath, then gave it away to someone else. However: I do find it slightly worrying to see so many people who genuinely see this book as a kind of manual for the times. No-one is saying Bridget is real. God help us, surely no-one is saying we should be like Bridget. As far as I know, a generation of adolescents didn't suddenly develop a craving to be Adrian Mole. Be amused if you can. Be very amused (if you can, I just managed the odd smile). But please don't let's pretend this is literature....."
3,The book vs the movie....,It was an amusing book. I did enjoy it. But the movie was much more entertaining..I'm not sorry I bought it.
4,100 books to read before you die,"This book was read by my book club in 2012. We were able to discuss Bridget's constant need for approval and her unending struggle with her weight and what that said about her and about our society. The structure of this book as a diary was also interesting. Some of us liked it, and others definitely did not. I would say that the constant calorie counting was tedious and made me think about why Bridget was so obsessive over this and yet so unhealthy overall in her food decisions and how those polar extremes could coexist."
3,wheres the asprin?,"this book gave me a headache. The new charicters, the weird names, the whole word formation. But I guess that is normal for a book in diary form. It was funny, and made you feel for bridget. MUCH BETTER THEN THE MOVIE!"
4,"of course we can relate, we're female's aren't we?","you know what they say, the book is better than the movie. in this case, the old saying rings true. (even though i enjoyed the movie version as well...)i can only say that these pages are more entertaining and its a shame that on screen they didnt develope the funniest character -Bridget's boss at the tv studio. i laughed outloud while reading and was disappointed to see his role was overlooked in the theater.i had fun reading this book and i think you will too!"
5,"Calm down, take it for what its worth","This book is great, reading all of these reviews, it seams assome are asking too much. This is not a world moving nobel prize winnerthat is making a statement on the female culture. This is a great book that any woman can relate to in some way or another (as i'm sure men could too if we could get them to read the book). This is a fast read for city train/bus rides. i found myself amidst an audience of people thinking I was crazy as i sat on the bus laughing out loud while reading as Bridget jumped around stuck in a dress in the fitting room. This is not a refined masterpiece of literature for ages, however a wonderful contemporary, lighthearted novel. READ It, its great!"
4,A great book!,You think you have had embarassing moments in life? Bridgette has some of the most embarassing moments ever. Showing up to the party in a bunny costume! Argh! Well written and hysterical! A laugh out loud book.
3,pretty good,"A friend recommended this book to me so I thought I'd try it out.I thought it would bore me to tears. But it didn't! Bridget Jones is so funny! And I really like the way she always makes an embarassing or downright awful situation, seem so funny. This book taught me to look at the lighter side of life and not take things too seriously. I've tried reading ""diary"" books like Adrian Mole (couldn't get past the first 15 pages) but Bridget Jones is the best so far. However I gave it 3 stars because I didn't find it that memorable, just very readable for a ""diary""."
4,A Laugh-Out-Loud Wonderful Read,"Hillarious book! Bridget Jones makes all neurotics feel normal. I laughed out loud at Bridget's inner thoughts which I rarely ever do with a novel (especially in public). Only downfall is towards the end, the realism drops (mother's whole criminal experience) which was a little disappointing for me because I was following the whole thing as true-to-life. Overall, I highly recommend this book. Outstanding!"
3,Good - but not as great as others have said,"I enjoyed reading this book very much, but I found Bridget to be beyond neurotic. We all have our neuroses, but she was over the top. At times I just found her to be annoying and I wanted to slap her for matching up to all the negative stereotypes about women. But if you love Ally McBeal, you'll probably love this book, too."
5,i luurrrrrrrrrrved it,"what a great book. it's a pretty quick read, ideal for vacation or before bed, and you'll wantto finish it sooner rather than later.bridget has such a distinctive voice, one that i really identified with, and the narrative reallyIS laugh-out-loud funny. sometimes you wish bridget would suck it up and behaveproperly, but what fun would that be, anyway...and if she was very proper the reader wouldmiss out on phrases such as ""pretending Perpetua was a Mexican cheeseplant,"" etc.any woman who has made it into her late 20s or 30s without being married, becoming amother, holding down a fabulously successful job, making scads of money and living aglamourous lifestyle will find something in the book that speaks to her."
2,Are we really like this?,"This is funny but depressing. For more promise, look elsewhere. PErhaps the heroines in Defemders of the Holy Grail. Thet are flawed but they OVERCOME"
1,Am i missing something?,"I couldnt stand this book! .... I tried to read it but i kept putting it down and reading other books then coming back bc the name and cover is intriging... when i saw the movie i was vastly dissapointed so the book sat on the shelf for another year... until that following summer i plunged through the book.. its ok if you like drawl, slow, novels that are meant to put you asleep... i know lots of people who didnt like the book and some who did so i guess it depends on your opinion of what good writing is but what i say? save your money and get the book from the library if you HAVE to read it!"
1,"I must be a ""Smug-Married""!","Call me a ""Smug-Married"" but I think this book stinks! Do 30-something Singletons really behave in this manner? The concept of counting calories, cigarettes (or should I say ""fags""), and alcohol units was novel for the first 30 or so pages...but by the month of May, it was getting old! This type of behavior made popular by Ally McBeal is stale. God forbid if Bridget Jones had any real problems in her life!!!"
2,Overrated,"Actually I'm rating this two and a half stars. I feel like the only person in the universe who absolutely hated the movie. However, most books are better than their movie, so i decided to read it. I thought this book dragged on and was very repetitive. I am happy to say that in the very last chapter is when a change occurred and made me think that i like the book just a little better than the movie.I feel that Bridget gave other singletons a bad name, she was so pathetic rather than funny. I am a single girl myself, and if i was so obsessed with weight, how much a drank, smoked, and how nobody loves me because i don't have a boyfriend...i'm sure i would have shot myself by now!! If you really have to read it borrow it or check it out from your library, but i think it's a waste of money."
5,This book is the life-story of me and all my single friends!,"Every man and woman has to read this book to be able to understand how we, single women of today, feel about ourselves and others. It's so funny and recognizeable, you can't stop reading it!The funniest book I've read in years!"
4,Fabulous,"I have passed this book along to five different friends and every one of them has loved it. The antics Bridget goes through enable one to realize that everyone dating in their 30's must endure the ridiculous. Even if you're not single you'll enjoy her relationship with her co-workers, mother, and friends. It's really a lot of fun."
3,A woman with low self-esteem's obssessive searchings,"I had trouble getting involved with this book; specifically, I never liked the character . Bridget is a shallow, self-obsessed individual that spends the book trying to find personal happiness through sex, alcohol, and complaint sessions with her friends. We women may all do this to an extent, but who has the patience to sit though page after page of it? You may find it somewhat amusing, granted, but there's no deep thoughts anywhere here. No wonder she's unhappy."
5,Absolutely hilarious and right on the mark!,"As a twenty-something ""Singleton"" this book really described all the funny twists of life in a medium level job and in a society where the marrieds think we're all missing something. This book is perfect for anyone who has ever been in a realtionship or just considered taking the leap. It's just great."
1,Ridiculous,"For anyone concerned about the ""dumbing-down"" of humanity, here it is in all its glory. This is a pointless, plotless, poorly-written excuse for a novel. And although it does provide a few chuckles, it's repetitive, shallow and utterly insipid."
2,In the Minority,"Well, it seems everyone has become captivated with Bridget Jones. Everyone except me. Feilding's novel (and I use that term loosely) is stale, pedantic and as deep as a shoehorn. It is obvious that Feilding has a great ear for dialgue, and she certantly is capable of having insight into the battle of the sexes, but at what cost? ""Bridget Jones' Diary"" adds up to nothing; a year in the life of Miss Jones is nowhere near as exciting as a day of your own. What's lacking is immediacy; sure, Miss Jones could be the British ""Ally McBeal"", but there is a subtle distinction to be made: Ally is ""everywoman"", but she's got edge. Bridget Jones has neither an active imaginary life (a la McBeal), nor any edge whatsoever. I very much wanted to love this novel; nothing sounds as appealing to me as a witty, well-written ""diary"". This, however, wasn't it."
4,"A Howler, yet poignant","Had a friend read this out loud to us at a bachelorette weekend on the beach - we wouldn't let her stop. Like other readers have said, I fell like 'I AM BRIDGET'. It has the feel of a British ""Ally McBeal""... very entertaining, but many truths hit home. I can't wait to read the whole thing!"
1,I want to shake her silly.,"I want to grab her, and shake her. Oh, AND her idiot mother. Never in my life have I encountered such a shallow character.I don't understand the appeal of this book - the movie was cute, Hugh Grant does smarmy so well... the book, although very readable and the diary-format is fun - is a complete waste of time and money.Bridget shows you the classic teenaged way of dealing with your problems - drink and obsess. She thinks only with her hormones, whines, and has a collection of equally shallow friends.Seriously, I enjoyed Meg Cabot's The Princess Diaries a thousand times more... also written in diary-form, Meg's character, Mia, is at least someone who learns from her mistakes."
1,Not a fan of this one,"Fortunately I didn't have to spend money or time on this book. A friend lent me the ""book on CD"" so I'd have something to do while driving my daughter, age 14, to a volleyball tournament. Both my daughter & I listened to the book and both of us found it tedious and not even vaguely representative of the female psyche, certainly not ours. If there's an interest in delving into the psyche of an extremely shallow and self-absorbed young woman, and it appears there is, then this is the book for them. Funny, I did not find it."
5,You think your life's bad?,"Poor Bridget, just can't seem to get any aspect of life right. Yet we as readers can't help but love her, mainly I think, because no matter how bad your life is, reading this book will make you feel better. You'll be laughing out loud at the predicaments Bridget manages to get herself into as well as the lunacy of some of the colorful characters in her life. Fielding's story is so effective because it's, unfortunately, universal. Most of us women can relate to Bridget's neurotic thought patterns, but what's great about this book is that, just when you think you know which way the downward spiral of her life is going, the story manages to surprise the reader with its tale. Read this book- you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll be uplifted!"
3,Lukewarm,"What? Huh? Tell me this doesn't speak of how women are today? If so, I'm in a sad state. If not, yippee. The book wasn't incredibly horrible, just not incredibly great like I was lead to believe through editorial and personal reviews . It was a quick read, although not earth-shattering in content and rather just blah. Also, it could be viewed as a little demeaning...."
4,Actually liked the movie better,I rarely like a movie better than the book but it seems that sometimes a director knows when to cut out unfavorable aspects better than a book editor. This was still a very good book and I highly recommend it.
4,Light Summer reading,"I enjoyed the book. I didn't find it to be LOL funny, except in one or two parts. But I did feel a lot of times that I was ""Just like Bridget!"""
4,Bridget's Diary,Loved the audio version of this book. Plan on recommending this to good friends.Husband broke out in laughter while over hearing part of this book. Wonder how soon this will be a film and who will play Bridget. Can't wait.
5,Been There--But this was still LOL Funny!,"How funny is it to have a look ANOTHER life in singleton-ville? I was amazed that while the cliches were there, they were all presented in a way that was either so fresh or so funny that I just loved reading about Bridget's crazy (like all of ours) life and equally crazy (like all of ours) love-life. I'd recommend this book to anyone. (Or at least anyone with a sense of humor!) It is just brilliant!"
5,"Clever, quirky, and thoroughly delightful!","Bridget may be neurotic and obsessive, but she jumps into the head of every smug singleton and reports exactly what is going on there. It is a cleverly written book which is a must read for any woman in her twenties, thirties, or older and any man who loves, likes, lives, or works with women."
2,A depressing story for those after thirty,"I thought that Fielding gave pathetic view of a woman's life after thirty. It was very depressing how Bridget was obsessed with her love interest, Daniel, and how he completely blew her off. It appeared as though nothing in Bridget's life was going right until the end. Overall, the book seemed unrealistic and full of Bridget whining about how pathetic her life was."
1,"Shallow, Stupid, Boring and Completely Self-Absorbed","If you spend all of your time obsessing about your weight, the amount of cigarettes you smoke per day, the calorie content of every drink, and the best way to let some loser guy get into your bed while an obviously good one gets your cold shoulder, than READ ON. If you have more important concerns, you will hate it. I just wish I could have given it zero stars."
1,Afflatus,"What's all the fuss? Do we really need a 250-page summary of the life of the desperately single, catalogued daily and ad-nauseum by the number of cigarettes she's smoked and tiny fluctuations in her weight? I'm all for Singles Empowerment and International Understanding, and I'll be the first to appreciate Brit humo(u)r. But after the first 50 pages, you've seen it all. And how about some complete sentences? This doesn't pass literary muster."
2,This book is popular with women? Which women?,"I'm amazed that this novel has been so popular. I love all things British but I couldn't stand Bridget after awhile. Her endless calorie counting, taking two hours to get dressed, and pathetic whining about not having a man border on the offensive. I'm a single woman myself and I have lots of single friends and I don't know a single one who acts like this. I wanted to shake Bridget and shout at her, ""Who cares if you have a man or not - enjoy your life! Eat what you want. Do some charity work! Do something worthwhile instead of drowning in liquor and self-pity!"" And as if that isn't bad enough, the other characters are one-dimensional cartoons especially Bridget's mother who becomes an adulteress, talk show host and thief - none of which is even faintly believable. If ever the success of a book made me wonder about the taste of the masses, this is it."
1,Just about the worst book I've ever read.,I had high hopes for this book. It got rave reviews on NPR and it was supposed to be the hottest thing in London. What an incredible disappointment! Incredibly pretentious and a real bore to read.
5,I loved it - and so did all my friends,"I can not even remember the last time I read a book so funny that I almost fell off the couch, as I did with Bridget (yes, I feel like I know her well enough to call her by her first name). I have now forced half-a-dozen of my friends to read it, and they have all adored it - one stayed home for two days to finish it, another ignored her recently-arrived-from-overseas boyfriend until she finished reading December, and a third stayed up all night reading and laughing herself silly. No, Bridget isn't the ideal woman. But she's what we all are sometimes - and she has irony and wit to go with her neuroses."
4,I loved it - it's funny and real.,"This book is fun. Plenty reviewers here tell you what it is about so I won't repeat it. I will only add that despite the amusement there is some truth here. Many young women in their late twenties, early thirties will find they can relate to Bridget Jones and laugh at their similar dilemmas."
5,The book was absolutely hilarious.,"The book was one of the best books I've read all year. The main character, Bridget, is one that all females can relate to. The book was a pure delight to read. I didn't want to put it down. It was absolutely hilarious and Bridget's life and thoughts were eerily familiar. I lent the book out to all my friends and most have gone out and bought their own copy. If you are looking for an engaging book and want a good laugh, I would recommend this one."
3,To Be Read on Many Levels,"You can review this book on two levels. You can say, well, yes, it had a stolen plot, but on the other hand, isn't that good? It has got several of my friends to actually read the 'original' Bridget Jones (!). However, I read this book when I was twelve, and although I laughed an awful lot, I suddenly thought.... ohmigod I am going to be like this when I grow up. That kinda scared me. However, I have recomended this book to a few people. I have just a few pointers, 1)Don't read it is you're still in school, 2)Don't go into it expecting too much and 3)REMEMBER it's FICTION, okay? The problem is not with the book or Helen Fielding herself, but with the people who say, 'I feel I AM Bridget Jones.' Stay away from them."
4,Good -- but a liiiiiiitle too repetitive,"Good overall story but the repetitive part came from the daily counting of alcohol units, weight, calories cigarettes. There was at least a count on every page."
3,A pretty successful remake`,"I enjoyed the book, but thought it smacked of ""Sheila Levine is dead and living in New York City"", a book I read in the 70's."
3,"GOOD, BUT NOT WORTHY OF MASS CELEBRATION","Bridget Jones is fun, light, sometimes silly, sometimes over-blown, off track as much as it is on, repetitive in ways that one who hasn't read it couldn't possibly understand, but also loveable enough that you just can't help but smile at the end of it and feel satisfied with what you've read. It's not a great book and it's not a bad book. It's not a great character and it's not a bad character. It's just cute, weird, and stylized in a way that isn't quite obscene. Those who hate the book are heartless and those who absolutely love it are overly forgiving.My suggestion would be to take it for what it is, forget it when it's over, and move on with life. But try it. It's definitely worth a read.Also, the Renee Zellweger movie is a good deal superior, so it may even be worth watching that first so that you don't let the book spoil it for you."
2,Fluff. If you like that kind of thing...,"An amusing read. Just check your feminist principles at the door first. Bridget is incredibly shallow. Just about the point I work up some sympathy for her, she dissolves into complete vapidness. (The whole bit about enjoying the drama of her friend's imagined death? Or her mother's criminal escapades? Please.) And the end is farcical. And Mark Darcy is, yes, the knight in shining armor... Also, I don't care how many lottery tickets she buys, but the device has to be consistent. Okay, all that said, it does have some funny bits. It's sort of brain candy. The pleasures you get from this are the same derived from reading People magazine. Fluffy confection. Not literature."
3,Entertaining Fluff,"A bestseller indeed, but nowhere near the Booker Prize shortlist. Light and airy tale of single woman in London and her wacky friends and family. Amusing, entertaining, and completely vapid. I wish I'd seen the movie first."
5,"Funny, An Innovative look at the single female","I thought that this book was quite good. I however found some similarities to a much older book. Maybe I'm wrong, but the story seems a little like a modern day Pride and Prejudice, but in a very innovative way. The heroin of this novel is not necessarily as strong minded as we would wish her to be, but at the same time, neither are we. We all go through our boughts of weakness and Bridget bounces back at every turn. This book is a delightful account of one woman's struggle with everyday life."
1,Absolutely awful,"I couldn't even get through the first chapter, and I absolutely hate how the author basically based it as a modern version of Pride and Prejudice. Yet Bridget is not ""perfect"" like Elizabeth Bennet ( P & P's heroine). Bridget is very wacky and does very silly things. It was just so boring to read in ""diary format."" The one thing that I like about the character is that she has her flaws. So that makes it more realistic. However, I must say that one ought to stick to Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen instead. Even though I did not like Bridget Jones's Diary, I did like the movie. I finally understood Bridget and who she was, and in the movie she is a very lovable character so I would reccomend the movie over the book."
3,"A titter here and there, but certainly nothing to rave about","To begin with, I first have to admit that I only read BJD as somewhat of an introduction to Bridget Jones's life, and the intentions of the author in terms of plot, characters' traits etc., in the advent that I decided to watch the movie (the movie is very good! watch the movie everyone!)Being aware of the worldwide ""acclaim"" for this novel, I had fairly high expectations for the book. Although, gladly the book did not dissappoint, unfortunately it didn't dazzle me either.BJD was not the barrel-full of laughs I had hoped for, but however, did produce a little titter here and there.I would say that this book is worth the read, but would have a limited re-read life, and probably *not* worth buying. - Unless on sale (the Bridget Jones in me speaking) hahaha. So by all means borrow it from the library for the perfect 'beach read', but I personally wouldn't buy it (at full price anyway!)"
3,It's a Fad,"Good book or no? It's an OK contemporary comical abstract of a modern woman's conflicts and struggles. Alrighty, that about sums it up. The book is easy to read, not too serious, not too deep, good for a laugh. It's NOT Jane Austen, I guarantee you that."
3,Entertaining story of being single,"This is a very funny novel. The story of Bridget and her friends brings back some memories of being single, but her adventures are pretty extreme. Her liquor salesman must be quite wealthy, I'm amazed at her alcohol consumption(and went to a college with a well known rep as a party school).Bridget's take on being a singleton is not to be missed, enjoy."
1,Bloody crap,"All I could think of was, Helen Fielding is laughing all the way to the bank with this one. People must be starved for entertainment, as this ""diary"" was so poorly written, not at all funny, and an insult to women, with its stereotypical depiction of them as man-hungry and desperate. If you want to read a really funny, British diary/novel, please read THE DIARIES OF ADRIAN MOLE. There is a real character for you. Bridget Jones' Diary is only good for wrapping fish."
1,terribly dissapointing,"great in the beginning but totally screws up half way through and makes one feel like they've ingested 1/2 a ton of good and plenty -- just another ""my prince will come and save me"" fairy tale -- that doesn't offer alternatives for modern women."
1,I liked the movie better!!!,"How sad is that!! Usually the book is always better than the movie, and I the movie wasn't that great either.This book depressed me, I couldn't get thru it so I took it back to the library. I wanted to understand what all the hype was about!!Sorry! :("
1,Couldn&#65533;t even finish book,"This book was one of the most annoying that I have read this year. It was so annoying that I could not even finish it, and I bought it in hardcover. I am usually able to struggle through a hardback when I buy it because of the cost. This one however was just too annoying. I thought the story and its premise was refreshing when I picked it up. It was a departure in plot and presentation from the other books offered last simmer the main character was just not very likeable. Since the book was about her I found it unreadable. I do not recommend it and would not reccomend it even if it is found on the bargain table."
2,Shallow quick read,"Bridget Jones's Diary fluxuates between being a critique of the superficiality of women's obsessions and a clever depiction of the growing pains of our late-twenties/early-thirties. Funny discussions with her flighty mother, overbearing friends, horrid boss, and stereotypical lovers do not make up for the disturbing simplification of intelligent women who seem introspective until they think about food, fat, self image, or clothing.Disappointing as clever read, disappointing as expose of late-twentieth century women. Not worth buying, but worth reading a couple of chapters if you find it abandoned by someone tired with the repetition."
2,The Movie Is An Improvement,"Great, great voice and humor. Really, I laughed. It was great, humor-wise.HOWEVER,The plot was boring and drawn out. I really think the format made many of the large events seem random. Also, she's kind of an idiot. Her attitude reminds me of the Princess Diaries, because she acts like a major teen.Also, it was redundant. ""I love [insert name here]. Let's go drink. Let's go have a fag. Let's sleep together.""WHY Darcy likes her is beyond me. If I met her, I'd be appalled."
4,GOTTA LOVE BRIDGET!!!!,"Didn't think I'd care for this novel, as typically I don't like stories told in diary format. But who can help but love Bridget? Book details her hilarious battle with her weight (which seems to fluctuate wildly at night), her struggle with her nicotine addiction, and detailed chronicling of both her alcohol and caloric consumption. More riveting still is her love life and ""involvement"" with the elusive David (and his concern for the ""missing"" skirt) and obsession with being Single.I don't believe that there is a woman alive who cannot relate to Bridget and her struggles--however ridiculous at times. Although I found the book many times to be laugh-out-loud funny, I struggled intermittently with the strong British references throughout--more than I have with any of the other British authors whose work I've read. However, that will in no way deter me from reading--and enjoying--the sequel.DYB"
5,"Women in Real Time, Fags and all","(Fags: term British folk use for cigarettes!) This book is hilarious. For those of you, myself included, who are tired of the self-help books, and want some funny fiction, definitely try BJ Diary. She tells it like it is, men, working, getting up late, worrying about the future, but still having a good time. Cheers to Helen Fielding!"
2,Too many cringe moments,"I did not expect a literary masterpiece when I started this book, but I was expecting a bit more than what I got. The character Bridget is so ""frightfully"" annoying that I found myself wanting to choke her. The humor was way too obvious with only a few one-liners that managed to give the book some redeeming qualities. This is an OK read for a 14 year old who isn't an intellectual giant, but those not in that category should just give it a miss."
2,futile attempt to bring down the inflated average,"This book annoyed me in that Bridget never changes. I had hopes in the beginning that she would somehow overcome her insecurities and neuroses, and so I endured her uninteresting obsessions. But in the end I felt duped by her constancy. She is a little kid whining for candy, only in the end to get her candy and undoubtedly begin whining for something else. Perhaps it is a true picture of the gen-x-er, but I live it so I don't need to read it in my free time."
2,"Silly, trite and a little funny","Sure, it really IS funny to be smart, self-conscious and just out of perfection's reach. But, really, the questions remains: So what? Helen Fielding is clever but even she has to know that Bridget is a joke and all that calorie-counting and cigarette tallying isn't very sustainable. If Bridget wants a different life, then why in the world is she obsessed with enumerating the idiocies of the one she has?"
3,Enjoyable,"Our book group picked this book to read. It was a fun summer read. I haven't been single for so long, it makes me think, ""Is this really how it is or was?"", pretty ""bizarre"". I liked the ending."
3,I didn't like this book as much as other folks did,"I liked the book for entertainment value, but I don't get the hype. While we all have our neurosis, Bridget was over the top. I wanted to reach into the book at times to strangle her for fitting into all the negative stereotypes about women. But if you think Ally McBeal is one of the best shows on tv, you'll probably like this book, too."
2,"Sometimes funny, but sad in a pathetic sort of way","I am probably one of the few who felt this book did not live up to its hype. Sure, there were some funny parts that I chuckled over, but for the most I found it quite disturbing that the protagonist was so embarrasingly desperate for a boyfriend and that she felt that being all of 126 pounds (Oh, the sheer horror of it!) meant that she was too fat. If today's women find that they can easily relate to being obsessed with ridiculous diets (when they are already rather small) and not being secure enough to be happy without a man, then authors such as Kate Chopin and Zora Neale Hurston obviously wrote about their strong female characters in vain.On the other hand, I do realize it's simply a work of fiction and that every novel doesn't have to have some life-affirming message at the end. So if you find yourself with a few hours to pass, this light,quick (albeit 'fluffy') read is actually not the worst way to go. You might even laugh a time or two."
3,"2nd book, better than the first","Having read ""Bridget Jones Diary"" first and then the ""Edge of Reason"", I was glad that I had read the first, just to have the background to understand the second. I found the first book to be so-so as far as entertainment value. It is basically just an ordinary single womens view of life."
2,Poor quality; cheaply made,"I bought this match case trying to find one like the one my dad had as an Eagle Scout. It was wonderfully well-made: it was water-proof without a rubber seal, the movement of both the cap assembly and the keyring attachment were well-finished and moved easily. Heck, you could even strike a match on the side of the canister!Not so for this crude replica: the metal is coarsely stamped, nothing is ""finished"", and none of the moving parts move easily. It's junk. Had I seen it up close in a store, I wouldn't have bought it. Reviews of other version of this product seem to say that other products in this category suffer the same problems. I thought that the name ""Coleman"", which I trust for many other camping tools, would mean that this case would be different. Unfortunately, no. I'll be returning it as soon as I can."
2,Poorly made,"It's a little difficult to open/close, and the strike surface is difficult to light a strike-anywhere match on. It also feels cheap."
3,book prices are crazy.,i would like to read one of this authors books but the price is crazy. kindle book prices have gotten to high in the past two years since i purchased my kindle. i love my kindle but hope the cost of books levels out or i will have to look into someother e reader.
4,Kindle price,"I enjoy her books and would like to complete my series of ""warner forever"" but the kindle versions are too expensive. So I'm not buying any."
5,a band with sax appeal!,"I have not been this happy in over 20 years. I played all of the sax. for 34 years , you bet I love anything by BILLY MAY!The years and loves can rushing back. Thanks, and look to rec. another order for BILLY?.....SONNY"
5,Rare classic,"I was inspired to purchase this because of a review I read, and it exceeded expectations. This is a Nat Cole that many have forgotten or don't know, but it is Nat Cole at his best. His piano his lively, his voice vibrant, and his accompaniers in the pocket. Combined with his teaming with the great Billy May it makes this a classic for all to own."
3,dissapointed,"THE ADTHE AD (AND INVOICE) FOR TOM MABE'S ""A WAKE UP CALL FOR TELEMARKETERS"" STATED THAT IT INCLUDED A (BONUS DVD). IT DID NOT! I TOOK THE CASE APART - I TRIED PLAYING BOTH SIDES IN A DVD PLAYER - NOTHING. THE ONLY REASON I CHOSE THIS CD, WAS BECAUSE OF THE (BONUS DVD). SOMEONE NEEDS TO CORRECT THIS FALSE ADVERTISEMENT."
1,It's Ok but...,"The guy kind of crosses the line to obnoxious from funny. A couple of them are OK but it gets old fast. He's a one trick pony.Save your money - download a few of the more interesting ones for free and see if you like it. Then re-consider buying the cd. As an example, he calls people at 3Am and they get mad. Ha Ha Ha. The first one (round one) a little more creative."
1,obnoxious jerk is as bad as any telemarketer,"What started out as a good game of giving telemarketers a taste of their own medicine is now just tom Mabe's obnoxious prank calling. Tom Mabe has done a 180 degree turn around and become the very person he despised in the first place.By making prank calls to people in their hotel rooms at 4 AM, Mabe is worse than any telemarketer who ever targeted him. There is no excuse for what he is doing now. He's just an obnoxious kid trying to make money by harrassing innocent people. Don't support him."
2,Eh,Product is nice but if you buy it make sure to run to the store and get some safety pins as the tiny patch of Velcro does not stay secure and the whole costume comes forward causing children to trip
2,Hat not included,I purchased this costume for my little boy who absolutely loves trains and Thomas. The costume came and arrived fast however there was no hat included and it was very bulky and only sat on the shoulders there were no ties or anything to keep the costume from coming off. Not a completely bad product just wasn't what we were expecting.
2,Not an ideal costume for active kid,"This might work for many kids, but my 21-month old son didn't like the apron-like style of the costume. Having it hanging down in front of his knees just slowed him down when we tried it on. The hat is cute, but he didn't want to keep it on. We're returning it and getting something that allows for more movement."
2,"Looks cute in picture, but not impressed with quality","I expected the costume to be made of fabric, but it is made of thin material, almost like foam/paper, and does not look durable. The hat is even thinner (like surgery cap). It's fine for an evening of trick or treat and for pictures. My son seems to like it."
4,Serves the purpose,"Sizing is right on... my son is a ""small 3"" and it was a little big, the shoulders slipped a lot. Durable enough to be worn a few more times!"
2,Waaaaay overpriced,"I bought this because my son likes Thomas & Friends, but I couldn't believe what a flimsy ""costume"" it was when I opened the package and took it out. The costume and that hat probably cost the distributor [...] cents to make in China, and they sell it for close to $[...] retail. This is just capitalism at its worst, even after taking the necessity of licensing into account. I'm taking it back to the local store."
4,Easy costume,"Easy costume to put on and off. It is sized for a 3-4yr old. My 2 yr old was a bit swamped in it. However he loved it and when he was tired of wearing it, it was easy to slip off and he was wearing street clothes underneath."
5,Thomas the Train costume,Purchased for my grandson for Halloween. Quality is very good and I'm sure he'll have a good time with the costume after Halloween.
3,True to the picture.,This was purchased as a Halloween costume for my grandson. He loves Thomas so was very happy with it. It easily fits over his regular clothes and is comfortable. We did sew elastic bands to the sides to keep it from gaping.
4,Exactly as described.,The costume arrived on time and exactly as described. The only problem face was trying to get my Thomas loving nephew into the costume. Not that there was any problem with the fit but rather he refused (what can you do with a 2 1/2 year old). So my sister put it on herself and was Thomas for Halloween. Oddly enough it fits both adults and toddlers alike. My own 2 y/o has been happily pretending to be a train in the outfit every night since.
3,It's ok...,"This is a cute costume but it is front heavy as all of the designs and extra fabric (since it's 3D) are all in front. If the child is short, then there is a possibility of tripping. The hat is very thin unlike the costume."
5,Perfect Costume,Loved this costume as it works well with any weather conditiion. We got a lot of compliments and now my kids can use them to play around the house.
1,NOT Dayton cables!,"Dayton cables are high quality items, these are not real Dayton cables! These vendors know that they are NOT selling Dayton cables, yet they continue to bait and switch in order to sell their cheap imitations. They should be ousted from Amazon!Hit the marketplace to buy the REAL Dayton cables."
5,it works,"It's a cable, it works, what else do you want? If you want to be a sucker and pay $150 at Best Buy go right ahead if it makes you feel better."
3,"Cable Works Fine, But It's NOT Dayton!","As other reviewers have said, this is NOT a Dayton cable. However, it works fine, and for the price, it's a good cable. Just not what it says. If you realize going in that it's not actually Dayton, you'll be pleased with it."
3,A starting point,"If you are planning your first reunion this book is a good starting point. However, you shouldn't rely on it completely. While it has some good ideas and gets you thinking about the beauty of strong families it's not very strong on details. For solid information about dealing with hotels, DJs, photographers and the bank I had to buy other books. Again, this is a fine book to get you started but you'll need more than this to actually pull off a medium to large family reunion."
4,A good guide to owning a greyhound,"This book provides helpful information and insights for owners of greyhounds as well as to those thinking about getting a greyhound. It contains first aid tips and obedience training guidelines that aren't available in most other greyhound books. It also has beautiful photos of the breed. There are only two drawbacks I have found about this book; it does not fully emphasize the need to keep greyhounds on leashes or in enclosures and the reading continuity is interrupted by the ""How To"" sections (not that they're not helpful but they seem misplaced)."
5,"Love it, love it, love it.","Yep, it's that good. Pretty Vegas is good, Afterglow was superb, Perfect Stranger roxx and the list goes on.Altogether a great album, and JD's voice is great and he shows on this album how versatile he is. From the low sexy growl to the soaring highs, he emotes well and connects well. He mesmerises with Switch.Definitely worth getting and good for many repeated listenings, with more songs growing on you each time."
2,A Band ripping off themselves!!,"I am giving this CD two stars for the memory that is Michael Hutchence. This was a man who had both a wonderful voice and ability to lead a rock band. I was a hard core INXS fan until Hutchence's death. The way the remanding band went about finding a new lead singer, via reality TV show (Hmmmm.....Just jump on the bandwagon) was tacky.As for J.D. Fortune, is it his fault or the band's fault that he is trying so hard to sound like Hutchence. HERE IS YOUR WAKE UP CALL INXS; ""You can't replace a great lead singer with some shoddy facsimile!"" No matter whom INXS would pick to be the new lead singer, he was going to be compared to Hutchence. If INXS wanted to really go into a different direction, they should have picked one of the female singers on the reality show. After all, some of them had some nice talent. How cool would it have been to see a woman sing Suicide Blonde?As for this new INXS, well ""It ain't pretty!"""
3,Not quite the same INXS,"The CD was not quite as good as I had hoped it would be. However, two of the songs were incredible. They stepped out of their typical INXS box."
2,Ultimately forgettable,"They made a good pick with JD, he's talented and sounds good. However, at this point, he might have been scared to veto some of the not-too-good songs on this album.The album basically isn't very good. Most of the songs are listenable, but forgettable, and the rest are unforgettable for all the wrong reasons.There was another thing about this album, which at first I could not put my finger on, but I have figured out. The instrumentals are missing something. The whole sound is lacking an organic, ""we played this all on real instruments in a real studio"" sound. The fact is, they sound more synthesized and ""80's"" then they ever did in the 80's. The songwriting isn't really inventive.The tracks I thought were the best are:The Devil's Party - Classic INXS soundAfterglow - Strong chorusPerfect Stranger - Another very strong chorus, but a better song in general than AfterglowUs - I liked this one a lot on the show."
2,Did I time warp?,"For those of you who watched the Rockstar: INXS series, what I am about to write will make sense, if not you may seem confused. INXS has quelled the awesome talents and voice of JD Fortune. During the show he had incredible energy and fire, yet on this album he has been toned down to a ""love song"" singer. Also, they BUTCHERED Pretty Vegas, PERIOD. Teh shows version is 10 times better as it is on my favorites on my computer, IPod and play lists. If you like the Switch version yet haven't heard the shows version, download it from MSN or wherever and tell me I am wrong. I was hoping this album wouldn't be an 80's throwback but it is and I agree with other reviewers that they indeed haven't got a clue to what mainstream music is like. I feel Marty was right during the contest that INXS needed some help moving forward. TOO BAD, so dissappointed. Glad I borrowed the CD not bought it."
2,"Better than the Go-Go's, but...","This isn't really TOO bad, but very unoriginal. I guess the old lead singer was what made the band anything but a second rate Huey Lewis knockoff, which is what this sounds like. It could have been worse - but that's about the only good thing you could say about it. I can't imagine any karaoke singer that couldn't 'write' songs as original as this. But since they have the marketing muscle, this will sell, regardless of the overall lack of attention to detail and generic vocals and playing. If you're going to imitate the 80s, why not copy the quirky and inventive stuff instead of beer-commercials, big hair, and silly, coked-up swagger?"
1,excuse me,"hello what is it that i'm hearin' on this review site that this is the best album inxs did.for ages hello this is not inxs this is JD fortune and 5 ""money grabbin'"" old men tryin' to sell the inxs name with whatever cheap marketting they can promote i had alot of respect for inxs now it's all gone because they gone and done the thing a band does when their desperate for money and tryin' to re-calm there thorn as the top music genius's but with JD fortune they suck donkey a$$ because..IT'S NOT INXS THIS IS NOT INXS"
2,"Some good, some not so good","Besides Pretty Vegas, Afterglow and God's Top Ten are my favorites. Afterglow was written as a tribute to Michael Hutchence and God's Top Ten was written for Tiger Lily, Michael's daughter. These 2 songs were very well done and spurred me to go to a Michael Hutchence tribute site and donate towards a star for him on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.The rest of the CD is good, but it doesn't come anywhere near the greatness of their earlier work. It's their first CD with a new frontman, so time will tell."
2,Surprised,"After listening to the album three times I decided to jump on Amazon and see what others were saying... I must say I'm surprised by the positive reaction. As a loyal fan of INXS I was excited by a new album. I admit I was drawn into the show that ultimately chose JD and enjoyed it. All this said I find this album to be boring and lackluster at best. To my ear the sound is muddy... it is not crisp and defined. While I like JD's voice, I would have rather had INXS take a different direction. JD sounds muck like Michael and I'm not sure that works. It would have been interesting to have selected Suzie and go a little different direction and create a new INXS sound. I guess I'm surprised that a creative band needed to try so hard to keep their ""Sound""...Don't get me wrong there are a few good songs but all in all I'm disapointed."
2,A Real Disappointment,"I had assumed that after tragically losing singer Michael Hutchence, the rest of INXS had been sitting on a mound of quality, unrecorded songs that needed to see the light of day. For a band that put so much time and effort into conducting a highly publicized global search to find a new singer and put out a new album, I thought it would have been better. At least, I hoped it would be. I was rooting for the band to have a big comeback -- I really was.But after actually hearing their new material, only one question comes to mind: why bother? The album has a few catchy moments (most notably in Afterglow), but is overall just bland. The band seems to have become a watered-down parody of its former self.There is more to a band than just a brand name. This album proves to me that the real genius of the original INXS was, in fact, Michael Hutchence, and that the remaining band members are now only going through the motions."
2,"WOW, not so good...","I was expecting MUCH more from this album, but unfortunately, the only worthwhile song is Pretty Vegas. Maybe they should've let J.D. write ALL the songs for this album. I think maybe INXS' hey-day is long gone. Very sad. After reading a lot of the reviews here, I have to wonder... is everyone listening to the same album that I am? I mean, I know this album was eagerly awaited by true INXS fans, but are you all being totally honest??? I don't like this album."
3,From a loooong time fan...,"...it's good. I'll bet I'm like hundreds of other INXS fans that didn't expect much from them anymore. I wasn't even sure of the whole TV show stategy thing. But the bottom line is that this is a solid album. Easily better than the last two albums and their best since 1993. There's a number of groovy rockers here, and the best ballad since forever in ""Afterglow"". Most tracks have some swagger and emotion in them. This is pennies used at this point, so if you're any level of fan there's no reason not to give it a try. Too bad JD is out of the band already. He did a good Michael."
5,Hutch is smiling,"They managed to find a front man who fits in the Michael mold. While JD will never be Michael, within 2 songs it's obvious that he just fits. I'm so pleased. INXS was always a favorite. And it was like losing a friend when Hutch died. I didn't think that they could pull it off. But they not only pulled it off, they managed to create an album that has not one stinker on it. It's like coming home."
4,INXS - Switch a Hit,Great CD!!! As hard as it is to believe - JD sounds so much like Michael Hutchence it's a little scary!!! This is everything that the INXS fans have wanted to hear! Pretty Vegas is still the best. I find myself singing it everywhere I go. Thanks INXS!
3,Good album dragged down in spots,"I was a fan of the original INXS before the reality show ever came out. After hearing about their reality outing, I decided to watch and see what happened. I was a fan of the show and was eager to get this album. The first half of Switch is excellent, with songs like Pretty Vegas, Afterglow, and Perfect Strangers. Even the song Hot Girls grew on me after a while of not being able to get past some of the semi-ridiculous lyrics. The second half of the album is a bit dissapointing, perhaps because it seems to slide into a series of slower songs. However, even the songs that are not as top notch are still very listenable and enjoyable. I just wish that they had kept the energy they built going throughout. JD Fortune, their new lead, has a great voice and plenty of charisma to pull off the songs. I can't say this has replaced their older stuff as my favorite, but I will definately be picking up their next outing with Fortune at the helm."
4,Great album,"This may sound so much like a teenager, but I find myself in some of the same positions as sung about in some of the songs. I love this album. I saw INXS live with JD as their new singer. Everything about him screams Michael Hutchins and INXS. Just looking at him, let alone just listening to him is fabulous. Favourite songs on the album are Perfect Strangers, Like it or Not and Never Let you Go."
5,They're back!,"I have to agree with what has already been said ... i am quite a younger fan at 23, but I grew up on INXS's Listen Like Thieves and Kick and was lucky enough to see one of the last concerts from the Elegantly Wasted Tour and love all their old stuff (even the later LP's are just as good if not better than the oldies). Anyway, I too was sceptical about the whole reality tv thing and a new lead singer, but once i heard Pretty Vegas and saw the video, i knew the boys were back with a frontman that sounds irrilly like Michael and can write some damn good lyrics too. This album picks up where the band left off ... if you have always been an INXS fan (and especially like the later albums), this is for you."
4,INXS REBORN,"It sounds dramatic but it happened: INXS found themselves a new album and a new lead singer.I had my doubts. I'd seen JD Fortune and didn't care much for his image. Many were puzzled when JD was chosen as the new rock star - but this album vindicates their choice.JD sounds uncannily like Michael Hutchence - so much so that I can't help but feel that the band couldn't get Michael's voice out of their head while writing their songs (and who could blame them?)Switch is truly a resurgence and the sound of a band that's never been gone. Comebacks are the hardest of them all - and without the original lead singer - near impossible for most groups.The band sounds hot - but after all, they were once the best pop rock outfit in the world. Michael Hutchence is a tough act to follow, but the songwriting and production clearly signal that there's more to come.They'll never replace Michael, but in spirit and sound, INXS remains INXS.A worthy listen."
5,Awesome return!!!!!,"Let me start by saying, I wasn't a JD Fortune fan on RockStar INXS, but they definetly picked the right person for the Band. The first song I got chills when I heard it (so similiar to Michael H voice). JD does a wonderful job on vocals and the BAND has not lost their touch. They sound great and still stayed true to themselves. I would definetly buy this CD, not a single track is boring."
4,wow- he sounds like Micheal,"I was pretty ticked off when I heard that not only were they going to find a new singer but doing it through a show. I was a big fan,and so bummed when Micheal died. I thought nobody can replace him. Well after listening to a few clips, if I didn't know better, I would of though it was the same band from 10 years ago. INXS did a great job bringing JD into their band. I think Micheal would be proud!Will I buy it? I'm not sure..I'm still bummed over Micheal's death."
5,"Love it, Love it, Love it..","I was an INXS fan the whole way--and when I started watching ROCKSTAR INXS, I was a little skeptical that they'd find someone to reel me back in. J.D. Fortune had me at hello..something about him made me want to watch and I really wanted him to win, and he did. So then I order this CD, thinking it may be pretty good--but bracing myself in case it's not as good as I hope..I have listened to it three times now--and absolutely love it. JD has an awesome voice, the song choices are great, and the very last song-a tribute to Michael Hutchence: ""God's Top Ten"" is emotional and beautiful.. Congratulations to INXS, not only did they pick the right guy- but the CD is awesome..Thank you."
1,Horrible! The worst money I ever spent!,This is by far the worst INXS album I have ever heard. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!
2,"OK, But falls flat","I listened to the CD three times and gave it away. I didnt watch the Rock Star show. I dont really know anything about the new singer. I did hear there were others that were better. He sounds like he is imitating Elvis. A bad Elvis at that. I am happy the guy doesnt sound like Michael, but he just doesnt have any range in his voice. His voice is just flat and dull. His voice lacks the raw sexiness Michaels had. The songs sound like they were just thrown together. I was going to give it one star, but gave it another for the effort."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I can't give this album 5 stars, simply because Shabooh Shoobah, Listen Like Thieves and KICK are 5-star albums. But this is very good. If you can get past the fact that it isn't Michael Hutchence, then it's a very good INXS record. J.D. has done quite a good job, and his original songs are among the best offerings from Switch. I couldn't imagine saying that if they had chosen the other guy (Marty?). Before I got the CD yesterday, I didn't want to like it, but now that I have it, I can't help it."
5,Very Enjoyable!,"JD Fortune sounds great on this cd, i was a marty fan on the show RockStar INXS, and i feel now that JD was the perfect choice for them. The Cd contains great music, AFterglow is amazingly beautiful. IN God's Top Ten is a sweet surprise with Suzie Mcneil's vocals so smoothly delivered, and then it goes into a great transition to JD's vocals, I also Liked the tracks Devil's Party and Hungry. INXS is alive and well and making great music."
4,INXS Switches it back on,"Recorded in a matter of weeks, Switch shows its hurried production in spots, but overall, it's a solid album. Switch comes out of the gate with ""Devil's Party"" and just gets better with comeback single ""Pretty Vegas"" and the sublime U2 vibe of ""Afterglow."" Things slow down with the up-tempo ""Hot Girls"" and ""Perfect Strangers."" The two tracks suffer lyrically, almost screaming ""look at our sex symbol lead singer."" ""Hungry"" grows on you, and ""Us"" (as heard on ""Rock Star: INXS"") is a potential INXS anthem. ""God's Top Ten"" is almost too earnest, but it's still a fitting tribute to Michael Hutchence. The album's weakest links raise the question of whether JD Fortune's lyrical talents, showcased on ""Devil's Party,"" ""Pretty Vegas"" and ""Never Let You Go,"" could have been further drawn upon for this album. But the bottom line is Switch is worth buying, whether you're a longtime INXS fan, a ""Rock Star"" follower or, like me, both."
5,JD Fortune An Amazing New Vocalist !!!!,"I enjoy watching talent shows such as ""American Idol"" and ""Rock Star"". They are continuing to find great new talent and are rapidly creating one of the best music eras ever. JD Fortune who excelled on ""Rock Star"" proves he is an excellent fit and an amazing vocalist for the INXS Rock Group as their new lead singer. ""Pretty Vegas"" is easily one of the best recordings of 2006 and ranks with the best of all time. JD's vocals are excellent on each song on the CD. I recommend picking up a copy.I do hope the next CD includes some remakes. JD's versions on ""Rock Star"" of ""The Letter"" and ""You Don't Always Get What You Want"" were as good or better than the original versions.Some other outstanding new vocalist CDs:Diana DeGarmo - ""Blue Skies""Carrie Underwood -""Young Hearts""Kelly Clarkson - ""Breakaway""Clay Aiken - ""Measure Of A Man""If your a music fan and love great music don't miss these CDs!!"
4,JD Fortune rocks,"If you liked what you heard from JD Fortune on RockStar INXS, you will like this album. It's a great new INXS album."
4,It's about time - Worth the wait,It's about time - Worth the wait buy it to enjoy - Welcome to Inxs JD
2,Not a good album....but has a few good songs,"""Dirty Vegas"", ""God's Top Ten"" and ""Afterglow"" are all standouts. The rest of the cd is just o.k. to somewhat stale. Worth a few bucks just for the three best tunes. Would enjoy seeing them live with the new lead singer, he's great!"
2,Only okay,"I really wanted to love this CD, but I just don't. It's only so so. The lyrics are weak and the CD seems somewhat contrived. I would not purchase this CD (I listened to it thru Rhapsody) and I will probably not listen to it again. Sorry."
1,Not as good as the original,"I love INXS. They wrote the soundtrack to my youth. Having seen them many times durring the 80's and early 90's w/ Michael. I allways had a blast at their shows.I watched the reality show w/ a grain of salt, mostly due to a jones for the good 'ol songs. I had a a bad fealing JD Fortune, or what ever he calls himself, was going to get the gig and the whole process was just a fake set up. As for the album. It has an artificial heart and no soul. ""Hot Girls"", ""Pretty Vegas""...WOW can a song title get lamer than that? I am sorry, but this album is ""just not right for INXS"" myself, or anyone else who was a fan of INXS."
2,Eh... It could have been better,"If you're concerned with sound, perfect aspect ratio, or for using with games, AVOID. When the signal creates a bright picture, or when the screen is mostly white, you get an annoying buzzing sound. The aspect ratio isn't a perfect 4:3, so you can't see the entire picture (one inch cut off on the left side, and half an inch on the bottom by my estimations) you're intended to view. This is most annoying for games, which may display information that you can't view because of this. The only advantage with games is the included A/V connectors in the front, but if you lose the remote, you can't access the GAME channel, making the connectors useless (not to mention that only one sound connector is included, instead of two).Get a Daewoo Portland instead, it's...less [money],...has no sound glitches, has a perfect 4:3 aspect ratio, and (with a RFU adaptor) works well with games."
5,A Good Buy,"When I bought this TV I thought that you would get whay you pay for because this TV was cheap compared to the other good brand names out there. I judged it totally wrong because it has oustanding color, its real sharp, and it is affordable. This is one of the best values for the little money that it cost. I recomend it to anyone. A GOOD BUY, TRUST ME"
2,spend the extra cash on a better quality TV,I've had this television for less than a month and I already have problems with the picture. I'm getting an annoying pinkish blotch of discoloration on the right side of my screen. be wary of buying this one. I myself should have taken the negative reviews into consideration. Do yourself a favor spend the extra cash on a better TV.
4,"A little old-fashioned, but worth having","I actually purchased this because I knew the author, who passed away in 2009, at just short of 100 years old. This recipe book would be great for the first-time cook, because it has lots of those little hints that experienced cooks learn over time. It is also full of classic recipes, although it's a bit out-of-date in that it uses hydrogenated vegetable oil for many of them (eg, crisco and margarine) when we know now that HVO is unhealthy. Just substitute butter, plam oil shortening, or good old lard where appropriate, and the recipes will be back to their original ingredients when our great-grandmothers were preparing them before 1950!"
5,One of the best trio albums ever,"There are number of classic trio recordings ever. Some of the first and earliest ones are by the classic Bud Powell trio with Max Roach and whatever bassist he chose. Then there are the random albums like Duke Ellington's Money Jungle Then there are, of course, some of the Bill Evans albums (especially the ones with Scott Lafaro). The ones that come to mind myself are Portrait in Jazz, Everybody Digs, and then Live in Montreaux.Then there is this album. It takes everything from before and advances it. Chick's playing is some of the best ever and Roy Haynes and Miroslav are phenominal. The only downsides are some of the free jazz stuff that takes a while to get used to.This a must have for any jazz fan in my opinion."
2,"Now he bores, now he puts to sleep","I must admit up front that I am not a big fan of Chick Corea. Nevertheless, I do own several of his records, and this one is by far the most uninteresting in my collection. The trio plays in a minimalist manner that may appeal to avant-garde fans, but failed to capture my attention."
5,Timeless,"Simply put, this album helped defined jazz piano trio music, and has influenced every pianist, bassist, and drummer since. Chick was at his creative zenith; clearly original, free flowing, and brilliant. He clearly was on a different wavlength with this. Roy Haynes plays much more than drums- he plays music, and Miroslav is perfect. The universe lined up for this, and hasn't been the same since.Many musicians since have tried to imitate this- few have come close."
5,Not the version to get,"The 2002 version remastered by Ron Masters is the one to get.For one thing, it sounds way crisper, especially the cymbals. For another, you get the original album in the order of its 1st release on vinyl, with the bonus material coming after. Much better! The bonus material is good, some even rivals what went down on the original, but the original material seems more to have come from the same creative genesis and stands alone as a sort of suite. Both editions are on the Blue Note label, so make sure you get the 2001 release, it is killer.As far as the content goes, this is a desert island recording, one of the finest examples of piano trio recordings ever made, period. A must have for any serious jazz collector."
5,The best stuff on the planet,"Chick Corea's highly individualized approach is present here throughout. More importantly, though, is his truly advanced level of musicianship and ability to sing all of his lines with great feeling. I think this is the distinguishing fact of this album. Corea is able to infuse each highly 'mathematical' statement, which has a structural beauty in and of itself, with impassioned lyricism. Miroslav Vitous and Roy Haynes accomplish a great feat by keeping up and empathizing with Corea at the highest level. A definite 5+ stars, bordering on 1 million."
5,Great!,"This has lots of fun stories, and Ian Carmichael's characterization is just outstanding. Not only does Lord Peter Wimsey appear, but I was pleasantly surprised by some stories that have another enjoyable amateur detective, Mr. Montague Egg."
3,Harriet Vane,one of the most interesting things about the volume of Sayers short stories is that in any version after 1942 the character of Harriet Vane is included; but the data shown for this book by Amazon doesn't state any version information
3,A man out of his time?,"This is my first Dickson Carr, and although I finished it, I couldn't help but feel that he would have been happier setting the novel deeper into the past. The language is anachronistic for 1945. The very smell of the gas lights burning permeates the book, so why didn't he make it historical? The style - which is pure melodrama, the characters and the dialogue jarred for me. The only thing that kept me reading, other than it being a quite short book, was that I had absolutely no idea who the villain was. This was only thing that might tempt me to read another."
5,A Carr Classic!,"John Dickson Carr was one of the best ""Golden Age Detective"" story writers of his time. This book was written in 1945, and it is a true classic. It has all the Carr hallmarks - an impossible locked-door crime, a taste of the supernatural; great settings (there are two here), and an impossibly evil villain. His books are very complex and very difficult to figure out. There are actually two crimes in this book. One was committed in France just before the war, and the other was attempted in England just after the war. Of course we are treated to Gideon Fell doing the detective work here, and let me tell you if you haven't read any books about Carr's Gideon Fell, you are in for a treat. And boy can Carr characterize. He has the knack of bringing to life wonderful characters in a very short time. His books are not that long. But they are filled with tension and even today, are not easy to put down."
3,Not Bad,"This case is attractive and small, both features that I was looking for. The case is a tight fit but manipulating the leather to increase the softness is working. I haven't had the problem of the case draining the batteries but if you do turn the visor over I think it would provide more protection. All in all the price was right and the quality of the leather is good. It is difficult to remove the stylus within the unit when it is snapped into the case. Small inconvenience, I like it."
4,Reader from PA,"I have only read three of the Conrad County Series. This was one of them obiviously. I really enjoyed it. My Main question is could someone please tell me the names of the other conrad county books. I would like to read all of them. I found some on here, but I wasn't sure how many there are. So if any one can help me out on this I would really appricate it. Thanks in advance."
5,Fun Game,"This is one of the Best Hot Wheels Racing Games available for kids... You can practically drive anywhere, even fly!!!"
3,Samla Mammas Manna,"Samla's music is full of mockery and buffoonning. Eventually Samla changed the group's name to Zamla Mammaz Manna and later to Von Zamla. (This album was their first and should be listed under the Samla not Zamla name). The change of the name is somewhat reflective of their perception of their art, nothing-can-be-serious-enough-to-be-serious. Just wondering if Rock in Opposition's main idea required some sort of jest... This album is interesting although pricey"
5,Outstanding Classics from two of the best,You can tell by the song titles that they are some of the best put out by the Cathedrals and Florida Boys. Add this to your collection and reminisce as much as you want to.
2,Missing Parts,This would be a great product IF all of the parts were included. Two of the washers were missing and one of the bolt covers as well.Precision Products 5-1/2-Cubic Foot Garden Yard Cart with Spoked Wheels LC-150-14
3,"Good idea, but needs some design changes","I bought this product to rake leaves into and dump on adjacent lot. So I rate this product with that purpose in mind:PROS: light weight, flips flush to ground so that you can easily rake leaves.CONS: instructions for assembly did not match parts; axle was rusty. leg stand is too high so that you really have to lift the handle to roll the cart. also handle is not height adjustable."
3,Okay for the price,"I had a garden cart 10 years ago that I LOVED, but it doesn't seem to be made any more, so I bought this because it seemed closest to what I had at a decent price. Putting it together was easy and quick. It does an okay job, but has some problems for my size and strength. First, the handle is too high, so you can't get leverage. This is especially a problem if the load is heavy. the second difficulty is that there is a bar behind the wheels, which you can't see in the illustration. If you have to pull up on the handle and pull the cart towars you the bar runs into your feet. Also, although the wheels (which are very good) go over rough terrain very well, the kick bar gets caught in the ground. I would not purchase this product again. I am going to cut down the handle to give me better leverage. Sure wish they made the cart I used to have."
2,5-1/2 Cubic foot Garden Yard,"It is very nice for light work but I was using it for sand, gravel and concrete at my house. It did not stand up to it the handle broke the plastic rim broke also. It lasted about 2 days of hard work. If it is for gardening and grass clippings go for it but the 400 lbs that it says it will handle. Well let's say I tested it and it failed."
1,Pricision Product 5.5 Cubic Foot Garden Cart,The Second time i used this Cart The top right corner Of bucket split open.This product is not worth a second glance.
3,Not for heavy loads,"This cart handles light jobs fine. The wheels and handle are weak so the cart gets stressed over 100 lbs and shouldn't be loaded over 150 but for light loads, it does an adequate job."
1,Very disappointed in company and product,"I was looking forward to receiving the Precision Garden Yard Cart but was sadly disappointed when I opened the box. One of the tires, which should have been new, was a used tire with a warped and rusted rim. It reveals a lot about a company that places an old defected tire in a product which should have all new pieces. I will be wary of ordering a Precision product in the future."
3,parts,"Product is fine, but the wrong parts came with the order, and it took the company 2 weeks to send the proper parts."
3,"Great for kids, but annoying for grown ups","My 3 year old likes this book and it has helped him with pairs. He even mentioned the glove part one day when we were looking for his gloves. As a grown up, the short repeative words with dull pictures gets old really quick. Luckily this was before the Olson twins."
1,"pointless, poorly-written songs, performed badly","I could have also titled this review ""I want my money back!"" but that might have been less descriptive. To wit: this ""music"" is country (I guess) that has simplistic trite lyrics and unimaginative melodies, all ""sung"" in an off-key little-girl whisper. Somewhere I read a good review of this CD, but I can't imagine where, and the SOB who wrote it owes me $15. How this drek ever made it onto a CD is a testament to how fouled up the music industry is. There are *thousands* of CD's that deserve your money; please don't waste it on this."
4,Portraits from North American Indian Life - Book,Being a 1972 edition there will be flaws not perfect. I purchased two of the same book and the print paper quality was a little different in both. The best was kept intact and the little lesser was taken apart - easy to do - to use the prints in the classroom when studying Native Americans. Excellent resource and images really pop when displayed on a vertical plane. What you would want to know is the size - the 11 X 15 is far more desireable prints than the 1992 edition smaller format. Also who printed - the ones that I purchased were Promotory Press not a first edition but copy from the first edition and price reflected this.
2,The Reviews I Read were not for the Book I Received,"An earlier edition of this book was apparently a much better edition. I received the 1985 edition by Castle Books.The photographs were cropped much tighter than Curtis' originals and they appeared to be under exposed, as they were much lighter than I had seen in other publications!The format of the book was smaller, at 9 x 11.5 inches rather than the 11 x 15 inch earlier edition. Print quality was poor!"
5,Change your life,"This is a well written and encouraging book. I had some difficulty sorting through the various editions on Amazon but this is the exact book I was looking for as it contains the original, the personal study guide and devotional journal."
3,Seriously Lacking,"I was dissappointed in this book. Although I am in the same place as the author; tired of empty churches and hungry for the presence of God to show up, I felt that each chapter was essentially a repeat of the previous one. There is a Bible Study section for each chapter, which I thought, again reiterated everything that was found in the chapter. However, the author did give some amazing testimonials from himself, as well as others, who had had life changing experiences of God's presence, and there are 70 thought provoking devotionals in the back of the book that I found very beneficial, so I gave the book 3 stars. Although, I think the author's motives were sincere, and you can literally sense his frustration, it was not a book that easily held my attention."
5,excellent,this book is excellent.I recommend it if you want to rediscover the presence of God in your life
2,It did n't help me a beginner..,"It did n't help me a beginner.. I bought this book hoping to help me locate ignition key harness, power lock switch, etc to do a ""Remote start Key-less entry system"" install project. It end up wasting time and money. I end up opening-up lot of unnecessary places.."
1,Much too vague,I'm sorry I bought this book. I was having trouble with the transmission and the electric cooling fan. Absolutely nothing on it.
5,18 tracks of great music,"Pop Top should be just that- it has one song after another that really should be top forty songs- Vision of You, Opportunity Knocks, Blue Moon Heart, Houston Street, Hello Mary Jane, just to name a few. These melodies and the lyrics will stick with you; you'll find yourself humming along and singing with most of them, and you'll also be wondering why Jim isn't a star. I predict someday he will get what he deserves. Pop Top is high quality rock. Jim shows depth in his music, and he's talented beyond compare. And with 18 tracks, you get a lot for your money."
2,Call Me Crazy For Buying This!,"I liked her single ""Last Call and that plus 2 more songs are the only ones that I like. this cd is stale, boring lyrics, boring melody. I will not buy anymore cds of hers. Sorry but this cd is just not for me."
4,"Lee Ann Womack, Call Me Crazy CD","I only bought this CD for the song ""Last Call."" I sort of previewed the rest of the songs on the CD, but still only play Last Call."
3,Call Me Crazy by Lee Ann Womack,"I like Lee Ann Womack, but too many of these songs are ones a person younger than me would relate to more than I do."
2,I CALL HER BORING (NOT CRAZY),"After giving this record 3 spins (at different times), I just don't see what the hype about this CD is about. The first single, ""Last Call"" is very forgetable and just plain boring but somehow it has slowly inched its way into the Billboard & Radio & Records top 20. None of the songs will cause you to hit the repeat button for a second or third listen. Considering the time Womack took between this and her last album, ""More Where That Came From,"" I was just expecting something more than this snoozefest of an album---and maybe that makes me the crazy one."
2,Nice concept but pales in comparison to other Java books.,"The book is almost an exact replica of Heller's Who's Afraid of C++. While it is well written and has an original style, it simply doesn't come close to books like Ivor Horton's ""Beginning Java"" from Wrox which covers Java in far greater depth, in a more exacting and practical manner. I would recommend that book or ""Just Java"" to a beginner."
4,The show is still great...,"While I was getting worried that Rescue me was getting a little long in the tooth around season 4, those fears were alleviated by season 5.1. The characters remain strong, and the stories are very funny. I liked the direction Rescue Me took with Tommy's kids, with one dating a fireman, and the other at a prep school embarrased to be with her parents. I also must say that kudos to Michael J. Fox for such a great performance, and very out of his usual nice guy persona. While, I haven't seen the second half of the season, I was very happy with this season, and recomend it to all fans of the Rescue Me series."
4,Definitely worth buying ...,"After the dubious fourth season I was wary of buying this season. But this may well be the best season since the second one. It's hard to know what got into the writers; from the overblown bathos of season 4, suddenly they are writing with a lightness of touch and wit that is thrilling. This is why so many of us love this show - the humour, the politically incorrect, the fun ... There are some supremely witty moments in this first half of season 5 (I haven't watched Part 2 yet), so do watch it.And as for the price - as many others have pointed out, this season is nearly twice as long as any previous. So it makes sense to charge more. Get over it."
1,Half a Season,I am absolutely NOT paying the same price for HALF a season as the cost for a full season!! I have the previous 4 seasons and will not be purchasing season 5 until it is all in one set for the same price. There is no excuse for this other than GREED. KEEP IT!!!!!
3,Overpriced...but still The Best Show On Television!,"Just watched the final episode of season 5 last night and looked here for availability of the dvd (s). I own seasons 1-4, having bought 3 seasons right here through Amazon. Total paid for 4 seasons was around $110.00, or roughly $2 per episode with 52 shows in the 1st four seasons. I see the Discounted price at $32 for 1/2 of the season and conclude quickly that the price has risen 50% (11 episodes for $32) compared to the previous years but... the shows' popularity and consistent Top Shelf writing are hard to argue with. It's still The Best Show On Television (and the only one I refuse to miss) Maybe wait till Xmas for a better packaged deal but I know the faithful will find a way to add season 5 to their library."
1,Save your money!,"I bought this book for my grandchild. I was at first impressed and bought it because of the beautiful cover illustration, but disappointed that someone would actually use their artistic talents to illustrate someone picking their nose, not once but twice inside the book. Then the words: ""When they had all finished belching and farting and behaving like twits...."" I was completely put off by the crudeness and the vulgar words in this book. To give this book to my grandchild would mean that I approve of this and I certainly do not approve of this. And the story is so weak, the only thing the book has going for it are the illustrations. We need to give our children books that encourage good qualities, good habits, and higher standards for them, and not books that simply make them giggle because of the off-color material that is not appropriate for them."
1,Overpriced rubbish and poorly put together,I would avoid this one. The drawings are crude and the writing is lame. There are better childrens books.
5,Charming! Madonna's best.,"I was strolling through Walmart in a very low mood today when I stumbled across Yakov and the Seven Thieves on the shelf. I picked it up and started reading. How truthful and uplifting this short story is. In no time I felt overflowing kindness and tenderness regained in my spirit. The story is one that speaks of the greatest kind of beauty -- moral beauty. When people recognize their flaws, which can hurt people and relationships, if they are strong enough sometimes a person can ""stop the chain"" of hurt their flaws cause. To be able to identify the barriers and problems that break love and hurt others, and to be able to correct those problems, one is more likely to find happiness. That is what this little book is about. Able to convey such great and helpful wisdom in such little space, Madonna is something even greater than a great author--she is a great person."
3,Was for a gift,"Waste of money. Just made Madonna reachier. But that is ok. Book was for a gift, so no worries, as longest someone is happy, right? That is what counts the most!"
2,so much for purchasing based on reviews...,"These things are flimsy and they arrived warped (with a slight curvature to the case). Regular-sized DVD case construction is much sturdier... yes, they are thicker but the plastic is also thicker and sturdier. These could be more sturdy. Though I figured they would pretty much be the same size (facially) as standard cases I didn't think it would be such a hassle to get the cover art inserted. You better have a straight paper cutter, or better yet just fold one end, unless you want to mangle the edges of the cover art. Expect to spend hours getting your collection moved over. How hard would it be to make the case just a tad (5-6mm) wider (facially) so that no cutting or folding is required on the insert? I'm returning these."
5,work great,"works really great, save me lots of space, and now more movies fit in my display. got em quick and in good condition"
3,DVD cases are not all the same,"For some reason Memorex seems to be producing/selling two different style DVD cases. For most of us, the simple center clip fixture which most cheap/junk cases now feature are the plague. They are difficult to lock the DVD into and tricky to dislodge. Most people break them after only a few tries. The ""old"" style (found in most pre-recorded feature film DVDs) have a multi-spoked wheel which centers the disc and fastens it at 3 to 5 different locations around the middle. The clear slim double cases have the prefered ""wheel spoke"" hub while the singles have been coming with the center clip style. LOOK BEFORE YOU BUY. Personally, I have become very cautious in my purchases from Memorex which is a shame because I use to trust them blindfolded. Memorex... are you listening?"
4,Storage Cases,The storage cases are excellent but the price is a little higher than target but is worth the extra to have them delivered to my home.
4,Memorex Slim DVD cases are great for product presentation,"I produced and Market my DVD Bedrest Fitness and use the Slim DVD cases to package them. They are pretty durable and because they are clear, I can pop the DVD in (which has a pretty graphic label) and don't need any other artwork for the product. Also, the plastic sleeves on the covers enable me to tuck fitness bands in so that shipping is easy and efficient."
2,"Some will not close, even when empty.","Defective: Several of the cases I received are warped and will not close properly; this is not the quality one might expect from a brand name like Memorex.These Slim cases have most the features you might look for in a standard DVD case however as the name states they are Slim, 7mm compared to the 14mm of a standard DVD case so standard inserts do not fit. This is not a defect it is just something to consider when choosing slim cases over standard cases."
4,A very nice suprise,being a fan of the genre I was surprised I had never heard of them. Read this was a re-issue and that if I liked bands like Queens of the Stone Age etc it would be a good match. They were right. I look forward to tracking down their other albums. If you like swampy stoner rock this is for you!
3,"Really, almost four stars.....","Interesting reading. A little dated now, but still ok....It's a group of short stories and articles ranging from 5 pages to 50 pages. The articles are out of date, But Bova came up with interesting stories of what may happen in the future.The first story is the best of the lot. Battle stations protecting the earth from itself. multi national peace keeping force.... Mutiny and destruction...The next good story is the international baseball teams. Instead of war, play baseball. Nixon is the team manager of USA when they go up against Cuba for influence of the Carribbean.Anyway, it's an ok read. Ben Bova does a good job of story telling."
5,One of Flynns best,This is one Errol Flynns best movies and probably his most overlooked. He gives one of his best preformances in this film and never looked better. He played Jim Corbett with a wink and a smile and seemed to really be enjoying himself in this role.Truly one of his best!
4,Gentleman Jim DVD,"A good old fashion story and a great fan of Errol Flynn movies. There is no smash em up, sci fiction action just an old fashion story, a movie not to be missed and add to your classic collection. Thanks Amazon"
5,Aclassic i have always wanted.,I have always wanted this one and had to buy a multi region dvd player to do so well worth it.
3,Knockout,"Glossy Warner Bros. comedy-melodrama mainly designed to show off Errol Flynn's impudent charm and youthful athleticism -- which it does beautifully. The movie features a typically professional recreation of the turn of the century, though as usual they lay the period detail on thick (Flynn's roistering Irish family may have you lunging for the remote). But the fight scenes are great, especially a very atmospheric match at the waterfront, complete with huge old ships docked just beyond the ring. Flynn has a nice scene with Ward Bond at the end, too, showing the sensitive actor he could be when he had the chance."
5,Illustrated Moto Guzzi buyer guide,"A bit dated and from the UK, but overall a good addition. Some good history in there too!"
3,IT GOES,"Good movie, but the camera and direction needs work. Reagan Gomez is a great actress, but this movie wasn't as great as her other movies that I saw."
3,"Not his funniest, but decent effort here!","I have been a huge fan of David E. Talbert's work for the past 5 years and as such have purchased almost every play and movie that he has produced. When this was announced I pre-ordered without hesitation as I have become accustomed to his consistency for producing quality releases. Unfortunately I was somewhat disappointed with this release, it has many known actors and actresses but even they could not save this from being just mediocre. I am still a huge fan of his work and will still continue to support him but this play was not what i was expecting and is not his best effort. See Fabric Of A Man, Mr. Right Now and What My Husband Doesn't Know for better examples of his work!"
2,"no, no, no","I can't believe I just wasted an hour and a half of my life on this stupidness. I'm prime member, so thank God I didn't waist money as well."
5,A highly recommendable book for the occult student!,"To read this book is similar to undergoing an initiation experience oneself. The book is very well-written, and it is hard to lay it down before reading it all the way through. Personally this book has had a profound influence on my life; I can only recommend it to the highest degree. If you are ready to get a push forward on the initiatory path, this book can do it for you!"
3,"Excellent book, badly proof read edition","This is one of my favorite books. I used to have an older edition of it which I read many times. This new edition by Cornerstone Publishers has been really badly proof read, if at all! Sometimes things get quite garbled. If you care about such things you may want to search for a used copy of an older edition."
4,will***pretty good,I read the second edition and learnedalot about proper programing techniquesand classes which i previously new little abouttwo things a new programmer may like is the fact that the output is printed in the bookAlso it is written to compile on most compilers
3,good single and great song but...,"The Armin Van Buuren mix is not in here. The mixes are by good dj's and all are well known and respected but NOBODY is better than Van Buuren. He has the broadest range of any dj out there and is the best out of the Dutch masters (Tiesto, Van Buuren, and Corsten). He really showcases his ability on Rapture and produced one of his best vocal mixes. This cd is really missing out on an amazing treat. Buy if you must but I would just dl the Riva, original, and Van Buuren mixes."
1,would you like some cheese with that whine???,"too cheesy for my taste, I got these joints as promos, and I still returned 'em!!! They could've kept the ""singing"" more analog instead of all that equalizing and tweeking, etc... The hype is here now, but soon will be forgotten..."
4,....tastes so sweet...or something similarly cheesy.,"this track. ooh, what to say. the progressive mixes[ from creamer and deep dish] have sultry vocals that WILL seduce you when the right DJ molds the track like clay into a set.the original, however...is squeaky and annoying, and i was very, very surprised that the ORIGINAL TRACK is THAT bad.but if you like your progressive deep and lush, with gorgeous female vocals and lyrics that really are meaningful, pick this up for the remixes."
4,worth the money,"the sound from this product is great. two things that i dislike are that 1. the timer is difficult to program, and 2. the panel light is too strong even if it is in dimmed mode. i have to cover the panel with paper in order to get asleep. it can read and play CD-R and CD-RW."
2,Disappointed gladiator,"This costume was worn by my 7 year old grandson. It looks cool, but all the pads fell off. The strings broke and it was very frustrating to him. In fact he said he hated it because it was so clumsy. It's a neat constume but the pads need to be better made for attaching. Also, the sword pictured would have been nice to go along with the costume."
5,The armour suit,Its the most awsome costume. My son loves it!!!! he thinks it is stupid becauz hes 16. But i like it!!
2,Doesn't look much like Diego,"My little 2 year old loves Ice Age I and II so I thought this would be a great hit. I guess it looks close enough to Diego that my daughter recognized it, but she kind of needed a bit of help as it is not all that similar. The legs also are soft and they bend easily so it is difficult to keep it standing up. She took a look at it, hugged it for 10 seconds and dropped it...so there you go!"
2,probably just me but i was disappointed.,I bought this after being intrigued by the Citibank commercial but didn't like any of the songs on it as much as the one in the ad.
4,L.P. - what a voice!,"This is the best album by a female artist that I've heard in years, and one of the finest releases by ANYBODY recently, period!I challenge you to find a better song released this year than ""Wasted"" (track 1)."
4,As good as the concert!,"I've been watching L.P. since her days with Cracker and I've gotta say this record is as good as her live shows! (and that's sayin something!!) She's definitely one of the most exciting new artists around!(I'm not a kid, by the way - couldn't figure out how to post in the regular forum)"
3,"If you like No Doubt, you'll love L.P.","From the opening track ""Wasted"", you can definately hear a few things. You hear talent and strong influences from No Doubt. The lead singers voice is very reminescent to that of Gwen Stefani's. Do not get me wrong, this is not a bad thing, but I have a feeling some will push them to the side as a No Doubt rip off. That however is not true. They have a very good style, different than No Doubt's, but always, the vocals similarities will be there. The title track is definately a highlite on the album. My recommendations are if you like No Doubt, definately check out L.P.'s ""Suburban Sprawl and Alcohol""."
4,Compulsory reading for every web designer,"Counting ""only"" 215 pages, this is a rather ""thin"" book. But make no judging mistake here. This book covers all the essential topics to building modern websites: usability, accessibility, writing for the web, design, CMS, web standards... If you are the designer pressed for time, you can easily read it in a couple of hours, and if necessary once again the next day, and the next day... The book clearly references other ""industry standard"" books if you want to learn more about each individual topic.A great overview of what modern web design should be. Clean, short and to the point."
4,"Carrie Bickner ""gets it""","A confession: I'm not a designer, have no tech. cred but love the web and work with designers frequently. That's what's so great about Carrie Bickner's book. It speaks to the professional and the interested amateur alike, with equal intelligence and without oversimplifying, in clear, engaging prose, a rare compliment for a technical book. Reading it, I feel empowered as a web design customer. I know where and how my money is being spent, where I should save and where I should not. It did me a great service and was pleasent to read to boot. Highly recommended."
2,I remember,"Generally speaking not my taste. Bought for just one track - I remember. The rest left me feeling anti or indifferent, so I don't really have much to say....."
1,Don't waste your money!,Very superficial treatment of this subject. Very little technical advice on installation.
4,Lives of Our Own,On a rate from 1-10 I would rate this a eight because some ofthe book was hard to understand yet some of it was easy to relateto. I liked thought that was put in it because I like to be able toget in their heads and think and feel how they feel. I disliked thebook cause there wasn't much that happened to the characters. Itwas a OK book if you had to read a book about racism. The book realspoke the minds of the teens. It included many of their thoughts andfeelings. Two improve the book she could of included the thoughts ofthe girls peers. And to attract more readers she could of written likea teen when she was writing their thoughts. Its a good book you shouldread it.
3,Simplistic is the key to sucess,i am 15 years old almos 16 and thoughthe climax was fairly weak and the vocab. simple i still enoyed this novel because it was real if you enjoyed this novel but found it easy read ALICE--a novel bye Sara Flaminham i think it is i enjoyed it
1,Lives Of Our Own,it was the most borin book in the world. there was no good part or 'climax' and it was written very weak. i thought it was a waste of time.
4,Two sides of opinons,"Its about a girl african american girl named Shawna who has just moved from denver to this smal town where everyone is all about this dance called ""The old south ball"" to her it seems like thats all they talk about, So when Shawna writes a article in the school news paper about what she thinks of the ""old south ball"" this is when conflicts start. When shawna is in her living room on the floor watching T.V. a small object comes blasting threw the window it turns out the rock had broken her window. When Shawna tries to see who did it the first person she could think of was Kari.Around the end of the book Shawna starts to find out why Kari had done this.I liked this book because it was a good book it showed two different sides of opinons and i liked that. It shows that just because your used to certein things doenst mean they can be changed and be just as good."
1,boo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,my daughter made me get. i read it first and not one picture of the heart....i going to write bad things of this book if my daughter hates it.book hatermrs.cook
2,Not Happy,"Previous DVDs to come out on DVD have had the Game almost Complete,They have had either the international feed of play by play or as in the case of the Tampa Bay Bucs, they used the Radio calls of the teams along with the actual video.So this is a huge disapointment, I am lucky to have the game recorded on a DVD recorder,As far as the rest of the fetures on the DVD I would give them 5 Stars,But without the game on it I can only give it 2 stars"
1,XLII CHAMPIONSHIP GAME,I NEVER RECIEVED THE DVD. I CANNOT REACH ANYONE WHO WILL HELP ME GET IT.IF IT GETS TO YOU GREAT IF IT DOESNT MY RESPONSE HAS BEEN NOT OUR FAULT.
4,Giants DVD excellent but too short,"Big Blue fans will enjoy this DVD of the amazing 2007-08 run-up to Super Bowl 42. I deducted one star due to the short shrift given the playoff games. While I can see the few minutes devoted to each regular season game, important playoff games like Green Bay don't get much more coverage than a regular season game! I guess the expanded addition DVD may be a better buy as this product will only satisfy casual fans. Anyway, fast delivery from Amazon (< 5 days) as usual."
1,Zero stars,"This was incredibly disappointing. Basically the NFL is trying to be clever & cash in twice. The DVD was advertised as having COMPLETE COVERAGE of the playoff games and Superbowl but as we all know now, that will not get released until June 2008.It is unfortunate that they chose to 'accidentally' forget to correctly label this DVD as just highlights. It is curious that the word 'HIGHLIGHT' does not appear anywhere on the DVD case or on any of the advertisements on the webpage for this DVD."
5,GIANTS FANS WE HAVE ARRIVED!,"If your a Giants fan then this is a welcome dvd to your collection. This dvd highlights some of the greatest moments of the New York Football Giants 07'-08' season up to the greatest of all, there Super Bowl win against the previously undefeated N.E. Patriots. A must have for any Giants fan."
4,a great memory of an awesome season,this is a must have for us giant fans...what an amazing streak of road victories!!! and the playoff footage is extensive and excellent!!! be sure to get one before they fade away from availability...enjoy
5,Amazing Suberbowl,"if you are a football fan, you will love this dvd or if you are a giants fan like i am you will even go more nuts over it."
1,disappointed,This was a poor choice. The DVD is advertised as a Super Bowl championship video. Nothing further from the truth all it is is highlights and super bowl pre game shows. NOTHING OF THE SUPERBOWL. FALSE AND MISLEADING AD. Would send it back but it is just not worth the trouble.
5,HAS TO BE GREAT!,"The Giants shocked almost everyone - even their fans! The most amazing season ever!! Beating the cheating, sore-losing, swaggering Pats was justice in a world without a lot of justice sometimes. After beating Dallas, I was a very content fan (TO crying was an awesomely great image). That alone made for a very successful season. Going on the beat the Pats and prevent their ""perfect"" year - that is one of the greatest events in all of sports. Everyone should buy this no matter what team they support just to see the guts and teamwork it took for them to win."
5,Best memories as a giants fan,The DVD is outstanding. Being able to watch Brady being sacked over and over is one of the best recent memories as a New York Giants fan
2,NFL SUPERBOWL XLII-New York Giants Championship dvd,"I must admit, I was a little disapointed when I viewed this DVD: the trail to the Superbowl for the NY Giants was interesting, but the actual Superbowl game between the NY Giants and the New England Patriots was lacking? I assumed from the title of the DVD, that I would be able to view the entire Superbowl Game, instead, I only saw the sections of the game thought to be the most important. That is fine, except I wanted my son to see the entire game just as it was played. He was disapointed as well...he is 16 years old and I wanted him to get interested in Football?????"
3,"Buyer, beware!","It is not easy to tell from the ads what this DVD is NOT, i.e. it is not a play-by-play recording of Super Bowl XLII. It does give a nice review of the entire season, a few minutes being devoted to the highlights of each game, and a little more time to each of the playoff games and Super Bowl. And there are few nice extras, but not the Super Bowl in all its glory."
3,It was okay...,"Based on the title of the DVD, I was expecting a little more Superbowl coverage. The DVD basically gives highlights of ALL the Giant's games throughout the season, not just the Superbowl... only the last chapter covers the win over the Patriots."
2,I like the Giants but the products desciption is misleading,This DVD does not even have the full super bowl it just has ten minutes of the super bowl. It has just some good highlights. It shows four minutes of the fist 3 quarters. Then six minutes of the fourth quarter. I would not recommend this product if you would like to watch the whole super bowl.
2,just a football fan,"I really want to buy a DVD which play the whole game. Do not care for all the hypes and perps, clips, highlights, players' interviews, etc. and what-nots.Can someone tell me if this DVD has the whole game recorded from beginning to the end?I would appreaciate it a lot.Just want to watch the game again, that is all."
4,Giants Superbowl DVD,"As a NYG fan, I saw them play throughout the season and didn't give them a chance to get near the playoffs. This DVD shows all the games throughout the season that gave me a new appreciation for how well the whole team really played. The playoffs were second to none. Superbowl 42 was the one the most exciting games I can remember. I usually don't like to watch football games more then once but this one I can. The only thing I would have liked to see more of is behind the scenes and sideline discussions. Also, more fan reactions in the stands."
3,Great for older kids that struggle with reading,"My son is reading at a 3rd grade level and loves being read to but doesnt care much for reading on his own. He has really enjoyed this book. Certain passages are read aloud and then the child must read on his own. You can click on any words you have trouble with to find out what the word is and if you click again you get a definition of the word, which is a great way to build vocabulary. It is a chapter book and the material is a bit on the younger side. The story is engaging enough that my son wanted to find out what happened next.I would recommend it for 2nd graders that are ahead in reading to 4th graders that are behind.I do wish Quantum would come out with some more advanced chapter books like the Lemony Snicket series."
3,More interested in beefing...,"than he is in laying out his thesis, which is actually pretty cogent and a decent argument as far as elite control over the nation goes. It's too bad, because his petty squabbles with Theda Skocpol and other luminaries in the field ruin what could've been a great title."
5,Grande Pino---Great Pino,Pino Marino is among the most talented and poetic Italian songwriters and at times has the power akin to that of Bob Dylan. He deserves a listen.
2,A Pretty Boring Series,"Alba spends most of her time building plastic models. One day, after her Grandmother dies, she is kidnapped by a cross-dressing man. He takes her to a base where she becomes the pilot of a mecha called a Jinki. Alba fights to save humanity.This anime is pretty boring. I realized about 7 episodes into the series that all these battles that took place for no reason. There is no clear enemy. It's like a child playing with with toy soldiers. There is no point to anything that happens in this series. The good guys and bad guys have no goals or allegiances. It seems like they have a simple code: ""Wow! Another mecha, lets blow it up!"" They simply fight for the hell of it. The animation is average, the voice acting is pretty good, and the soundtrack is okay. Nothing important happens in this series. It just kinda exists. I can't recommend it. It's a serious bore."
2,Call Center Savvy... for big centers,"I have been working on establishing a call center for a small IT consulting company and was hoping to find a book to aid in selecting technologies and determining management and training methods. I didn't find it here. Call Center Savvy is directed toward the managers of very large centers, and is much more appropriate as a theortical discussion starting point than a practical guide to call center management. Also unimpressive is the fact that 78 of the book's 208 pages are used as a listing of companies offering products for call centers; while the phonebook-with-a-bonus might be useful, the same information can be found online (in a more searchable format)."
4,Average monster movie,"I saw this movie on tv and I didnt think it was that bad.Actually,I thought it was pretty good.From what i've learned from watching ""Grim""it is about a powerful troll named Grim with the ability to move through walls,that lives in a cave underneath a suburb and feeds on flesh.Creative storyline,average acting,and average special effects."
2,"bad actors corny musci, weird monster","thiz movie had terbile actors . they screamed just a tiny bit when that ugly monster came, to be honest i would have laughed. The music waz bad and didnt get you into the mood. Anmd the monster looked the the apes in Planet of the apes. thiz movie waz bad and about thiz mine. i could have made it better."
4,This is a great toy,"My now 4 year old daughter got this and the Prince Eric Ken for Christmas. She loves to play with them. She usually doesn't play with Ken as much because his leg pops off very easily with movement. Also, she broke off one of Barbie's feet and insists on buying a new Sugarplum Princess, so the toy is not very durable. She does love it though and she likes posing her in different ballet positions, so I still give this toy a high rating. Just advise your children to not bend her joints too far, if they are old enough to comprehend."
4,Gift set not worth the price!,"I shopped at 3 different stores and found it much cheaper to buy the doll and book seperately. I saved [money] buying each item seperately. However, it is difficult to find the book by itself, but do comparision shop."
2,My Barbie......,"Well, it isn't everyday someone sends a 13 year old a Barbie. I used to be OBSESSED by Barbies but I grew out of them.So, about a week ago I recieved a package from one of my mom's friends. And surprise surprise it had a Nutcracker Barbie and the video.It's really beautiful, but, really, not much to do with it, except for brushing it's hair, twirling it around on her little stand and letting her fall in love with my Lifeguard Ken. But I thought the sticky little hair jewels make really neat Hindu jewels......very cool."
5,A Written Ovation for Season of the Sacred Fool,"This book chronicles the life of a man that has experienced many things, seen many places, known many people, and felt many emotions. All these experiences come together to tell a wonderful story. Even though most people have not lived as adventurous life as the poet, I can almost guarantee that any reader will be able to find a poem in Season of the Sacred Fool that can be related to their life.I have been waiting for this book for quite a while, and I was not disappointed in the least. I recommend this to any person with a passion for poetry....and for life."
5,Poetry By A Caring And Sensitive Man,"A friend suggested I read SEASONS OF THE SACRED FOOL, by Otto Ochs. Even before completion of the volume of several dozen poems, I was struck by Mr. Ochs sensitivity and keen observation.It is apparent that Mr. Ochs is a caring individual. He cares about his family, he cares about people and he also cares about his world. Care alone does not make for great poetry. However, Mr. Ochs writes with great skill.Mr. Ochs could have turned into a hardened man after his rough and less than idealic childhood in Europe. He instead developed into a thoughtful man, which we are now all fortunate to know through poetry.The poem BREAD in the volume stands out as one of the many poems that caught my heart. Readers will be enhanced by SEASON OF THE SACRED FOOL."
5,Dark and mysterious...,"This is probably the best ""horror"" anime released in America this year. If you were a fan of Witch Hunter Robin, you will definitley enjoy this title as it reminded me of WHR more than once.The story is about a boy named Shiki, he isn't normal though. He has the ability to see ""life threads"", lines that when cut the object/person is destined to fall apart. He ends up meeting (and killing) a vampire princess who becomes his ally. Together they are attacked by a powerful vampire named Nero. They use their skills together to defeat him.The story here moves slow, with alot of drama thrown in. There is no comedy, but I prefer it that way with this kind of story. If you like dark and spooky anime, this one is for you."
1,There is no Tsukihime anime,"There is no Tsukihime anime.Seriously though. This anime sucks so hard, many of the English-speaking TYPE-MOON fans vehemently deny its existence. It doesn't hold a candle to the real game. If you watched the anime and liked it (or even hated it), PLAY THE GAME! It tells the story so much better than the anime (which just sort of takes one route and ham-fistedly jams elements of other routes into it).Oh and the characters look all retarded too."
5,A Treasure of a Treasury,"The best of the classic Golden Books stories - with original artwork - come in a little treasure chest. These are smaller versions than the original books, with easy-to-wipe puffy plastic covers. Too cute! A great gift for a little one. Or treat yourself and bring back a little of your childhood. A great value for the money."
5,Stellar performances.,"My pick for best-ever performances of these songs:""How Long Has This Been Going On"",""(He called me) Baby, Baby, All The Time"",""Angel Eyes"".June Christie is incomparable."
4,Thick and Soft,"These sheets are luxuriously thick yet lightweight and so comfortable. They are exceedingly soft and seem to get softer with every washing. The cut is generous, fits my mattress easily. The piling is a bit more than I expected, but the good things about these sheets far outweigh that wee complaint."
4,Historical,"The Noonday Demon is a fascinating book. I have no problem becoming completely engrossed in it in seconds, and can read it for hours. I first borrowed it from the public library but soon realized I would need to own it. There are passages in this book I'll revisit again and again.The writing is incredibly powerful, his insights even more so. I've been struggling with depression for many years, and in reading this book I feel comforted that someone understands and can accurately articulate what I experience regularly.One thing about his story that I found interesting was his seemingly inexhaustible resources, be it friends, pharmaceutical drugs or money. I believe him, but I think that his pill-popping may have exacerbated his problems and deepened his depression. I'm convinced that while anti-depressants can be life-saving and are a blessing for many people, they need to be taken in moderation.The Noonday Demon is an important book that had to be written."
5,The Benchnmark for The Topic,"Virtually comprehensive in scope and penetrating enough to create an excellent overview of depression in all its aspects -- personal, clinical, sociological. An excellent starting point for anyone concerned about this much misunderstood and pervasive disorder. Exhaustively researched and engagingly written by an intelligent and compassionate person who has wrestled with the demon himself. See Also: the Brain Series at Charlierose.com, where Mr. Solomon and a super panel of experts discuss depression brilliantly."
5,ASTOUNDING!,"Though I am given to hyperbole, let me state flat out that this book is simply studpendous. It's worth ten stars.I have read a ton of books in my life: Fiction, non-fiction, biographies, you name it. Also, being a psychologist, I've also read many (usually dry)texts on nearly all aspects of psychology. But this one, my God, what a book!Put it this way: If you have an appreciation, as I do, for writing at its absolute finest, well, look no further. You will never read a book better written than The Noonday Demon. In the proccess, you'll also learn a great deal about the worst of human afflictions: Depression. It's at times a painful ride but boy is it worth it! Hope you enjoy it and pass it on!!"
2,Too Depressing,I was overwhelmed by the complicated explanations to define depression and I couldn't get to the feel good part before I was too depressed to read on.
2,Too dense for me,"This book has interesting information... stories and facts. But it's so densely written as to be almost impenetrable. Editing would have helped, but I think my chief complaint is with the book's layout. The chapters are extremely long with almost no breaks in the text to delineate a switch in subtopic or give the reader a place to pause. With a little white space and perhaps some subtitles, this book would have been much more accessible. As is, I just can't seem to wade through the swamp."
1,Big Pharma's Darling: Award Winning Depression Book,"The excellent writing in Noonday Demon describes the agony of depression in a profound way. The author is the son of Howard Solomon, head of Forest Laboratories who sells Celexa so there was a lot of big pharma money behind the book. Author Solomon doesn't seem to know a thing about how his own brain works, and basically has decided to surrender helplessly to his own mind. I would rather see mediocre writing describing the joy of how you get out of depression instead Pulitzer Prize poetry about the agony of how you have to live with it."
5,"A ""must-read"" for compassionate Americans","Solomon has written an outstanding authoritative and compelling guide to understanding the many kinds of depression that plague us, their treatments, and their development in various ethnic , age and gender groups. His descriptions of ""the experience,"" having been there several times, communicate directly to the reader. It's a good bet that most of us have had or do have a friend or relative struggling with this crippling process. That's why it is a ""must read."""
2,Too raw for me to read........a trigger for my depression,"I had to put this book down after 70 pages. It was too graphic and too raw for me to read. With a history of depression myself and 2 hospitalizations, it triggered me into another depression. Do not recommend to anyone with a similar history as myself."
5,A great supplement to graduate level texts on depression,"I literally cannot put this book down. I am not a sufferer of depression, but a grad student majoring in psyschology. I have been looking for a text book would give me lots of accurate and valid information on depression but also give me the patient's point of view on this disease. This book fills the bill.Morever, at it's heart this is a well-researched ""Atlas"" that guides you through all the phases of depression, external perceptions of the disease, and includes psychosocial effects of the patients, their loved ones, and support system. Andrew Solomon includes alot of anecdotal and well-researched information on psychopharmacologial medications, for those who have in-depth questions on efficacy, side-effects, and basic neurochemistry.Most importantly this book would be very helpful for anyone who is suffering with this disease and is a great guide to where to look for help."
3,Depression,"This is truly a book of ""epic"" proportions. It is not written by a mental health professional. It is written by a person who suffers from depression who is a researcher (both data and interviews). It is heavy and fact filled. This is not a casual book. It is a resource for those who suffer and their families."
1,horrible,"the other reviews pretty much sum it up- this book stinks. It's too long and too pointless. I suffer from depression and I learned a bit, but not nearly as much as one would think from the size of the book. If you are writing a paper, this might be a good source. I don't suggest it if it is for your own use. If you are horribly suicidal, it will keep your thoughts and self occupied for a long time, hopefully until the feeling subsides a wee bit. Borrow it from the local library if you must read it."
2,Narcissistic Twaddle,"All I could think was, ""Damn, if I had so many friends at my beck and call to talk me down off the ledge, I'd never be depressed."" I don't know quite how to explain it, but I felt no empathy for him. I only ended up feeling more depressed. As a history of depression, the level of research was quite impressive.If you read Prozac Nation and wanted to punch her out, steer clear of this one as well."
2,I got more depressed,This is not a book for the faint of heart. In gory detail you get to live with Solomon and his valueless search for a way out of depression.I found the reading to be repulsive in some areas. In particular the experimentation with homosexuality.Would not recommend at all to anyone in the downside of a depressive cycle
4,CLASSIC FOUND IN HARD COVER,I MUCH PREFER HARD BACK BOOKS AS THEY ARE MOST OFTEN EASIER FOR ME TO READ. THIS IS A CLASSIC IN THE FIELD. I WAS HAPPY TO FIND IT AT A REASONABLE PRICE.
4,Triggering,"See the thing is... I like this book. It's excellent. Solomon has an intimate knowledge about depression. And I think that's the problem. Reading about his experiences, written so viscerally, has triggered another depressive episode for me.I may finish this book one day, but I just wanted to warn anyone who is triggered by depression and/or suicide to be careful and listen to their emotions when they are reading it. No reason to almost get a panic attack after reading a book."
5,A Personal Account of Depresssion for All Persons,"Powerful. This book is one of the best on depression I've come across, and I can't recommend it more highly. Those who suffer from depression will gasp at Solomon's ability to put into words feelings and emotions that are so difficult to depict. So moving, this book may cause even those with a ""toughen up"" mentality toward depression to think twice."
3,"A brutally honest depiction of depression from the ""inside""","Though perhaps somewhat long winded and sprawling the reader will be well-rewarded with its brutally factual description of manic depression as ""lived"" in its various forms, while, at the same time, being masterfully interwoven with the current literature and research on the subject. A brave feat by a talented writer, who brings this highly misunderstood but prevalent problem to light albeit in slightly exhibitionistic fashion. But that is its charm."
4,The Noonday Demon,"Andrew Solomon has managed to put into one book a complete view of depression from his personal experiences and extensive research that spans the spectrum of history, politics, impact of adddiction, suicide, alternative therapies and treatments. For anyone suffering from depression, or wanting to understand the disease and how to help, this book offers that opportunity. Solomon does not delve into the multiple variants (e.g. Bi-polar) other than to mention them from time to time; so if that is what you want/need, there are other books out there for that.This is not ""Depression for Dummies"" - it is a more clinical view of the disease. You may find that you need to put the book down for a bit, as each chapter is very comprehensive."
5,The Best Thing I've Read on the Subject,"I was skeptical of this book when it was suggested to me. I haven't liked most of what I've read about depression. It was either too detached and clinical, or so personal that it seemed hard to relate to my own experience. This book strikes a remarkable balance between a personal memoir, scientific exploration, and collection of anecdotes, while remaining cohesive.I'd highly recommend it for anyone who has depression, or is close to anyone who does."
5,"Great book for anyone interested in the whats, whys, hows of depression","If you have had any personal connection to depression (yours or a friend's or relative's) this book will be a revelation to you. I thank the author for a new understanding of depression, what it is, how it accumulates, how it is expressed, and finally what I can do, for myself and for others with the condition. Extensively researched, it it s real page turner at the same time. Great book."
4,A Must Read,A thorough discussion of depression from the first-hand experiences of the author and interviews of others. A must read for all those suffering from this illness.
4,A Thorough Look Into Depression,"NOONDAY DEMON is a powerful and informative resource for anyone touched by depression. For people in the throes of depression, reading such a large book could feel overwhelming, which is why I gave it four stars instead of five, but the depths to which Mr. Solomon travels to expose depression from all angles is remarkable. As someone who has lived with depression for nearly 30 years, I find this book a valuable touchstone. Susan Rose Blauner is the author of HOW I STAYED ALIVE WHEN MY BRAIN WAS TRYING TO KILL ME: ONE PERSON'S GUIDE TO SUICIDE PREVENTION."
2,Made me depresser,"This book isn't for people who suffer with depression.Didn't understand why it had so much dispair in the beginning of the book.Just sad,sad,so sad"
1,"Whine, Whine, Whine","""I must have all of my wishes filled; whine, whine, whine."" From reading this book, Andrew Solomon comes over as a spoiled rich brat, who looks for answers to his depression everyplace but inside himself. This is typical of immature people who want a pill to do it all for them, but refuse to do the hard work of confronting their own mistaken attitudes and beliefs. All of Andrew's whining is merely symptomatic of his resistance to therapy. If he went to a good cognitive therapist, he could be cured in 5 - 6 sessions."
5,Christmas with Lou !!!!!!!,"You cannot get it any better than Lou, he is just awesome. He is a talented and gifted man with such a wonderful voice. I was really glad when I saw the songs on this CD, since it is sung by the BEST !!!!!!!!!! Thanks Lou !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Overrated,"This album has its moments but the for most part is overrated. The highlights of the CD are remixed samples taken from Monk's legendary session w/ Coltrane (Trinkle, Trinkle) and some snippets stolen from a Sun Ra CD (A relaxing place on Venus). For sure there are some brilliant highlights on this album. The cover of Tony Williams' There comes a time is top notch. However, much of the album just seems to drag. I think Gianluca has a lot of potential to be the next big avante garde trombonist, but there just isn't enough here yet to make it interesting. If you really love the avante garde, and especially if you are a Grachan Moncur fan and are looking for someone who might be his next generation predecessor, this is a must have. For everyone else, it's not worth picking up. This CD is not bad. It's just that it had such high reviews everywhere (here on Amazon, all music, and downbeat magazine) that I was expecting much more."
5,"Excellent, beautiful furniture!",I ordered this vanity set for my 4-yr old daughter and I am so impressed. It's perfect for her size and she loves it. It is well constructed and was very easy to assemble. I would highly recommend this product for any princess' castle.
5,Best Princess Vanity Ever!,"After paying the initial amount, I admittedly was somewhat worried. After opening the box and assembling (about 10 minutes), I was very impressed. The construction is solid, painting is very nicely done. The right side jewelry box is a music box, and when I say music box I mean the original music box, not some digital/electronic tinny sounding thing that requires batteries. Yes, you wind it. I love this, but not as much as my daughter she plays with this thing everyday. If you are looking for a memorable gift, this would be it."
4,Good southern story,This was a good story of typical southern women who care deeply for each other and their heritage.Especially interesting for those who live here.
4,Fun read,Enjoyed the story very much. It was funny and suspensful all at the same time. It is an easy read.
4,Delightful southern saga,"Another reminder that one should never think of southern women as weak and soft. We may be raised to be ""southern belles"" but we are made of tough material. To get the sweetest sound from the smallest of bells forgers know to use the strongest metals. So it is with our genteel southernbelles. It's never a good idea to come between us and our family or our land."
5,Small town Southern women,This is a very interesting story about a group of small-town southern women who watch out for each other. Takes you back to a time when loyalty was key to friendship. A fun read!
4,Funny women,This is a chick book. The characters are well defined and I loved them all. An easy and fun read.
4,Easy Read,"This was a nice little story about friendship and the fight against good and evil. An easy read, interesting plot and well written."
5,A Delightful Book!,"A delightful read! Glad I found this book & author. Serious subject matter (spousal abuse) with the Bird Watching Society women determined to save their friend - to ""do what needed to be done."" There is one part that involves a turtle which had me laughing so hard I had to put the book down to rest my laughing muscles. I would recommend this book to anyone as a fun read about a serious subject."
4,The Tea-Olive Bird Watching Society,"I enjoyed this book, being from the South for the past forty years. It is charming and delightful....not always believable, but fun. And it does tell a sad tale as well of the abused woman who is unwilling to confront it, believing she caused this. I do not understand that thought process. And it is about enduring friendships as only southern women offer."
2,Tea-olive bird watching,"I couldn't even finish it. The first couple chapters were ok, but then it became so like other books I've read that there didn't seem much point."
3,"It's ""OK""","An entertaining read, however, I got the sense that it might have been written by a 12 year old. A cute story."
3,Tea Olive Bird Watching Society,"Plot was fine, but was a slow read to start due to background story. Liked the characters in the book, very colorful. Land is left to the ladies of the Tea Olive Bird Watching Society. Story is about marriage of one of the ladies to a former judge who is from a different community and how the other ladies of the Tea Olive Bird Wathing Society try to help her out of the marriage."
4,"Very cute story involving Southern ladies, mystery and mayhem!","This is a fun read about several Southern gentlewomen who strike back when a newcomer to their small town threatens one of their own, and the entire town's way of life. The author kept me engaged with her unique perspective on Southern women and their hilarious capers. (The part about the turtle made me laugh out loud!) Pick this one up for a great read!"
4,Good book,I enjoyed this book. It was an easy and quick read and the ending left you feeling good. I'm glad I bought this book.
4,The Tea-Olive Bird Watching Society,"I love this author and this selection was not a disappointment. A lovely old fashioned, southern tale with wonderful characters."
4,Bird Watching Society review,"The Tea-Olive Bird Watching Society are a delightful group of Southern ladies who set a memorable example of friendship. Their united front along with their loyalty allow us to glimpse a determined group of ladies who work through formidable obstacles to try and rescue one of their own. It was light, entertaining, and fun reading."
4,tea-olive bird watching society,This is a fun light read for the beach...I read it during Labor Day weekend...it is especially appreciated by birders...that don't take life lists of birds too seriously.
4,Good Southern Read,Fun mystery about a small Southern town. Good character development. Full of surprises. Enjoyable read for a vacation or anytime.
4,Tea-Olive Bird Watching Society,The Tea-Olive Bird Watching SocietyFun to read - not great literature but good entertainment. I enjoyed it. Those ladies were creative and determined.I actually purchased it from Amazon for my Kindle Fire. Perfect for Kindle reading.
4,The tea-Olive Bird Watching Society,I enjoyed the book. It was a different type of book that I normally read. The control and abuse part I didn't care for.
4,Light Mystery,"I loved this story of a very small town and the influence of a small group of older women on the dynamics of the town. A newcomer arrives and they plot some clever, though humorous, plots to rid the town of his influence. It's a fun read and I would recommend it to those who love good character development along with some suspense."
3,Good Light Reading,"I thought that the Teal Olive Bird Watching Society was a very sweet story with lovable characters. They are all upstanding, well-mannered ladies who are confronted with a murderous dilemma that they feel compelled to resolve. This is a good book."
3,Simple plot,"Two Uncomplicated, religious, rural women plot to kill ""the villain"".Kind of funny. Restful, cute summer reading. It filled an afternoon, butI wouldn't read it again."
3,Fun but predictable,Its a cute story with fun characters but is a very predicatable plot. As an avid reader I felt the book was OK
4,Fun book,"I thought this was a fun, well written book. I liked the interaction among the women in the book. I also liked how they took matters into their own hands, inspite of their good southern manners."
4,The Tea Olive Bird Watching Society,I really enjoyed the story. It was funny and the characters were interesting. It was an easy read. I highly recommend it. Thanks Amazon
1,Contrived Fantasy!,"Well, I finished this book, but I can't say I enjoyed it. Everything in it is so contrived. *Spoiler alert* The women's names taken from hymnal songs is just silly; whoever heard of an entire townful of mothers all sticking with a stupid theme for their children's names. And the respected judge who turns out to be a wife beater whose treatment of his first two wives caused his family to banish him. I have known women who felt trapped in abusive relationships, but a middle-aged woman who wants to stick by a physical abuser after knowing him for all of 5 months just wasn't believable to me. The whole town seemed populated by superficial morons. Save your money. Buy something else."
3,Not really my thing!,"I feel a little uncertain about this review. it's the first time I've given anything a review less than 5. I guess I have always felt the need to review those books which I really like but have been less willing to give reviews which are not favorable. But here goes.This book is O.K. but it's boring. Everyone is such a cartoon like single dimension character that it was hard to get involved. The humor was thin and not at all subtle.The thing is that I am sure that there are other readers who might find it very enjoyable so I was reticent to give it any less stars. For me, I tried it 3 times and then I gave up. i did read in quite a ways because the reviews were good and I figured I just kept missing something, but alas not so.So, I guess if you enjoy really light reading, about 6th grade level (content not acceptable for that grade level) then this is your book."
2,The Tea-Olive Bird Watching Society,"This was a little too far fetched for me. The characters were colorful but I hoped for a more dynamic plot and the ending was a disappointment. Sorry, I tried to like it and I finished it but prefer a different type of fiction."
4,Easy read,"This book is a real easy read. These older women , several widowed, share some of the most interesting hobbies and interests. The underlying concept is the power of their long term friendship."
5,JEWELLERY MAKING MANUAL,"This book covers not only the basics in detail but expands these to include more complex techniques. It is well written and comprehensive, the pictures are a great help in showing what is described. For abeginner like myself it is invaluable"
5,Make room for Vincent!!,"Move over, DiCaprio; Vincent Kartheiser has arrived!! He rocks! This is definitely one of the most entertaining movies of all time! I enjoyed it from start to finish. There was not one flaw in it that I could find, aside from the obvious computer illiteracy of the screenwriter and director. Then again, ""Hackers"" and ""The Net"" had the exact same problem, so what can be said? Aside from that, no flaws whatsoever. Buy it now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Please Put It On DVD!,"I remembered seeing this movie as a little kid! But, I really want to watch this movie again. I also want this movie to be on DVD. I think this movie really deserves to be on DVD."
4,Masterful Masterpiece,"Masterminds may not be a great movie but a good movie. Acting is great. Plot is great. Script is great. It is hilarious, exciting and action-packed.It was fun to watch ""Masterminds""I love Patrick Stewart's acting in this movie.Only flaw is no blood and no deaths in the movie. Not that i'm complaining."
5,Wish they would release to DvD,"Loved this movie would love to see it again, just wish they would release it to DVD I don't have VCR anymore ><"
3,"Good for Stewart fans, suspensful, but not outstanding.","Masterminds is a hostage suspense story similar to Toy Soldiers. In this case Patrick Stewart is the culprit, ostensibly setting up security for a private grade school. Vincent Kartheiser is a teenage computer wiz who dropped off his little sister at the school, then stayed behind to pull a prank with the school's new computer system, getting trapped inside - hidden. There's plenty of action & suspense, but the plot's slightly confusing - it's not clear what Stewart's team is really up to, and some of it seems far-fetched even for this type of movie. In other words, it will keep you interested, but is hard to follow. Fans of Patrick Stewart probably won't be disappointed, except for the fact he's the bad guy. Brenda Fricker is good as the principal, the rest of the cast competent but not outstanding."
2,UGGH,"I might say that it was not that a great movie, nor even a good movie at that. First we have antagonists who are most likely mercks, but lack the skills to prove that they are. Even their leader, considering his role, is not appropriate to be a British SAS. Also, they are very ""soft"", to consider that they are equipped with dartguns. I got irritated also that there were many times that the protagonist will surely be caught but the criminals were so stupid. The film also lacks of realism, not much crowds outside the gate, considering that these are children held hostages. Mines exploding very near policemen, but they were not much affected by the blasts, etc. Well I need not go on. For me, don't waste your money buying this movie. If you want, just rent it."
2,What is this????,"I'm a newbie to this Zope, and would really like to see some working examples of this product, so I can at least compare what is correct to what is in this book. None of the examples I've come across so far work! What's worse; I cannot figure out what's wrong with them because I DO NOT KNOW ZOPE YET! I bought this for $., and I guess for examples, its ok. But man, if you want to come across as an authority in something, it wouild be helpful to make your books' examples workable."
3,Better than The Zope Book but somewhat dated.,"Unfortunately this book is getting somewhat dated and if you don't have the inclination to check on the things it says or get involved with the on-line community you might find yourself rather out of date. Most of the core concepts of Zope are still somewhat the same. However the book does miss some areas but it is a good primer. It's, in my opinion any ways vastly better than The Zope Book which is very poorly written, unfriendly, confusing and all around not good. I recommend this book for people who already understand Python and have developed web applications in the past using other technologies. That's not to say this book isn't a good primer, it's still fairly good for that too. But expect to back up your reading with some IRC conversations in #Zope irc.freenode.net best of luck all you Zopers."
1,Three strikes - it's out,"I have shelved this book at least three times in disgust and frustration. Each time I pull it from the shelf, I think: ""There must be SOMETHING useful in there"". Hours later, I re-shelve it again, wondering why I don't just throw this amazingly content-free book away. All the other comments about typos etc. are absolutely true. This book takes a confusing subject, adds 500-odd pages to it, and does absolutely nothing but leave the reader at the starting point, wishing for the hours of his/her life back."
4,Don't believe everything you read!,This book had lots of twists and turns and proves that you need to get the facts instead of believing what you read. A real page turner!
5,"""Crazy with a twist""","Angela was down right crazy with a twist, she takes Monica & Carlos life and turns it inside out. One minute Monica and Carlos was a happy and loving couple until...something out of the norm bring their lives to a crushing...Boom...! Regardless of all the unconditional love the diary takes over.Miasha really pin pointed and gives you some raw material that has the twists and turns that is page turner. I really look forward continue to read her work.Reviewer of Big Time Publishing MagazineClaudia Brown-Mosley"
4,The Guessing Game-Who should u believe?,I enjoyed this book. I tittled it the guessing game because thats just what the author will have you doing. You'll be asking yourself: Did she? or Didn't she? Thats what keeps you on the edge of your seat and makes this one a tad bit of a page turner. This is Miasha's second novel {the first was much better} I like her writting style and I'am looking foward to her next book called: Mommys Angel. The ending shocked the hel* out of me! I reccomend this book to all.
5,Fast Read,"I really liked this book. Angela has a problem with men, they seem to send her to the mental institution. Well this time, it was suggested that she write a diary to get her feelings out. She's the mistress and boy does she have some stories to tell. She details her sordid love affair with her obsession Carlos. And then has the nerve to mail it to the wife. You won't believe what happens next..or will you?I knew this book was going to be good when my 14yr nephew started reading and ended up halfway finished within an hour! One of my favorite books by Miasha"
4,twisted women,"This was a very good read. Never second guess a good man for the sake of a crazy woman. Monica and her husband Carlos were the perfect couple. Carlos made the mistake of talking to a client, Angela, about the comings and goings of his relationship with his wife. Angela wanted Carlos for herself. Carlos denied her of the priviledge. Angela tried to commit suicide and was institutionalized. At her doctors request, Angela wrote a diary of a fantasy life with Carlos then mailed it to his wife, Monica. Monica flipped and tried to kill Carlos. This was a fast read. recommended books: bitch, stacy, keisha, a hustlers wife, shiesty"
4,ANOTHER WOWER!,"Miasha where is your head??? LOL, Miasha is a different type of author with different twist on her stories. This book had me wondering the whole time I was reading. ""who is lying and who is telling the truth"" well this book does not leave you hanging and you will definitaly find our who the liar is......Great Read!"
4,SHE'S ONE CRAZY CHICK!!!,This book was a very intresting read. It had lots of drama and was very fasted paced. I wish the book was longer and had more detail. You can't go wrong with a book FILLED with drama. Enjoy!
1,"The concept sounds great, but the delivery was whack!","This is a must read if you are desperate to read a book and finish within 2 days or are taking a road trip and want something to kill time. Otherwise, I would not recommend it. It was very unrealistic, the characters were not polished. And of course it had a fairy-tale ending where all is well in the neighborhood....that's too fake and not at all real life."
2,OK,"This was my first book by this author and it was just OK. I mean it was a very quick read (finished the whole book on my lunch break). It had twist to it, but it was pretty predictable. I can't totally agree with other readers that it was suprises and twist and turns b/c at the end I was thinking OK.....and how did i know that was going to happen?? Maybe if I was in 9th grade I would have thought this was the best book of the year."
4,Pretty good,I thought this book was pretty good. It was a very quick and easy read and it kept my attention. It was a little predictable but I did enjoy reading it. And it does make you have a greater appreciation for life and family.
4,Extremely short....,But a true page turner... I finished it in less than 4 hours. A lot of suspense and twists and turns.
2,Just Okay...,"I didn't really care too much for this book. I think she could have developed the characters a little more. It was a quick read, but that's about it. This was my first book from this author, so I won't judge her by just this. But don't think I'll run to get another one either. Maybe some of her other work has the WOW factor, this one didn't. I gave it two stars because I commend the effort for writing a book, and the concept was there. I just think she could have added a little more to make it interesting."
3,could make for a better movie rather than a novel,"i usually don't like novels, but i was just curious to know what a mistress puts in her diary. the author was good at making it seem real at first, but as you go through, you see where it's just not realistic and at that point, i couldn't even suspend my disbelief because it seemed like the author babbled a lot. the climax was good and it got you wanting to read more but as you read more, you might say, this can't be true. i guess things like this can happen, but probably not to the author's extreme, but read on, it gets thrilly and it teaches us who are in relationships to be more private in our relationships with people we dont really know. it kinda teaches us a lesson."
2,"Not a GREAT, read","This book was very typical...nothing about it excited me. Actually, while I read the book, I thought to myself, ""Why the heck am I reading this."""
2,A Little Much.....,"I read this book a few months ago, and I've been straddling the fence about writing a comment. This was another story I found to be a bit far-fetched. I've been stalked before so I know there are some loonies out there, but come on......I won't go into detail so as not to give the plot away, but, the story was a bit much."
4,Shocking Book,Through the course of the book I became shocked and amazed. There are some twist and turns that will really throw you for a loop. I would recommend this book.
4,Breathless!!,"This book took me for a turn! Angela was dangerous and devious and mentally unstable and she didn't care who she hurt all for love. I was just so shocked how the story end, all in all it kept my attention."
5,Drama...from the beginning to the end!,I have to admit that I really didn't think that this book was going to be that good...boy was I WRONG!!!I loved this book from the beginning to the end! The storyline was so believable and the characters were easy to relate to. You think that you have this book figured out by the middle but it takes you on so many twists and turns that the ending will surprise you...and then when you think you've read it all...Miasha takes the book to a whole different level!This book is smaller page-wise by most standard books and makes you want even more...but the story was told very well and I felt like I was offered a complete story! Great Book!!!!TaNisha WebbKC Girlfriends Book Club President
2,T-E-R-R-I-B-L-E,This book was not what i expected.....It seemed like a rush job....Something i could have wrote in a weekend my life story is much more interesting....Sorry I wasted my money buying it. I'm glad i bought it used though. I'm speechless of what i thought of it other then it was terrible. Very unrealistic in my eyes. Most women usually do their own lil investigation before just blindly taking the word of a woman she knows absolutely nothing of. The cover is more intriguing then the book. Very disappointed.
2,one big yawn,"This book was awful. I can't believe anyone actually liked it. It was slow, predictable, and I had a hard time reading it. Thankfully it was a short book. Do yourself a favor and borrow this from the library or a friend. don't be fooled by the reviews. It wasn't even 1/4 of what the reveiws make it seem to be."
4,very tight book,"this book is very frank,but yet it makes you read page after page.Carlos, Monica&Angela the Mistress flips the whole script. Miasha is a Happening writer. very creative minded&I can't wait for her next book."
3,Bigband tradition is still alive!,"It is impressive to notice that bigbands have still spread all over the USA after so many years even considering they do not hit the charts anymore.Maybe one could say some charisma is missing when comparing the current bigbands with the late Count Basie or Stan Kenton but they still carry some charm.Bob Mintzer is charming. Creative arrangements and good sax solos are his personal difference.Here you'll find a bunch of his arrangements in a live recording.Kurt Elling contributes with vocals on 2 tracks, maybe a must for his fans."
2,Not what I was expecting!!,"Pushing to the Front is one amazing book. But this volume is missing all kinds of stuff! The truth of the matter is, it was published before Marden had finished writing it. If you read the ebook and want the book, don't get this one. It'll be missing all your favorite chapters.Sorry. But it's still pretty great, and a nice showpiece =)"
4,Its a case ...,"What else can you say about it :)But seriously, this case is well designed, and contrary to another reviewer's statements, has not hastened battery wear for me.I have been using this case for over 2 weeks, and my battery life has not changed much at all, although I do not carry anything in the ""wallet"" area, and have turned off the ability for all but the power button on my visor to power the device on.I would have given this 5 stars, but the way the Visor sits in the case makes beaming files to others a pain, but this is also a perpetual gripe I have with the visor itself, so I wont take it out on this nice little case too much :)"
1,Watch out for this Case!,"I bought this case a few weeks ago, and suddenly my Visor batteries started to run down in about a day. Turns out that the front of the case taps the screen and keeps it on all of the time. Very lame!...I was hoping to keep others from having to suffer this problem."
3,Leather Quality???,"I bought this case first and foremost because of its looks. It's very stylish, and the Visor clips into it securely. Most cases use Velcro style securing methods, but this one works much better. It's not geeky looking, and holds everything well.I had this case for 2 days and noticed the blue leather on the binding started to crack. I'm sending it back and looking for one with perhaps a softer leather, more free to bend."
4,Very nice looking case...,"But like others have pointed out, the leather is stiff. I rubbed some leather conditioner on it and that helped a little bit. The blue leather has not cracked yet, but it seems to scuff easily.The case holds the Visor very securely, but you have to completely remove it from the case to HotSync, and probably even to use the IR port. Bottom line: It's a decent case for $30 and looks much better than most."
3,nice looking case but...,"I got this case free with my visor, it's a great looking case but when I put cards in the cardslot it seems to push the buttons and turn it on which got really annoying really quick, and also the leather seems to get scratched eaisly. I have switched to the Incipio zippered case and would recomend it instead."
2,Stiff leather...,"It is a case that can carry your PDA and that is it. If you plan to put anything into the the little money sleeve, you probably will not be able to close it properly. I found the leather to be much too stiff and notice cracks after two days of light use. The only good thing I can say about this case is that it is small enough to fit into the rear pocket of loose fitting trousers. I am likely to continue shopping around for another case made of softer (higher quality) leather."
5,creative bible lessons in Revalations,I am a seminary student and had to present a teaching moment on Revalations 12. This book is excellent and I am glad that I purchased it to use throughout again for all ages.
4,I enjoy the book...,I have just begun teaching out of this book to my High School Catchism class. The questions are thought provoking. I wish there were a few more answers for the teachers in the book. I say this because Revelation is such a difficult book to understand and a little bit more insite from the of this Lesson book would be great.
5,Fantástico,"Pegajoso y alegre. Me hizo recordar ""mis tiempos"". Realmente muy bonito, me encantaría conseguir el Volumen 2."
1,Died in just 18 months,I purchased in June 2010 and the switch abd 18 months later the switch is now permanently stuck in the ON position needing to be replaced. Warranty was only 12 months so I'm stuck needing to purchase a replacement
5,Live at Cambridge,"This is another great recording of Ezio doing what they do best, playing live. You get a good selection of tracks from their past albums, with all the atmosphere they seem to generate live. I have to say I've been a fan since the very first album and although they are still a great band, their studio albums are not doing them full justice anymore. I don't know if it's the production on the studio albums or what, but if you want a real taste of Ezio and want to hear their music as it should be heard then you've got to buy this album and go see them live. They're still genius!Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
3,There is always one in the crowd-I guess it is me this time,"This is my least favorite Bill Evans disc. The sound quality is really poor. An amazing amount of distortion and a really muddy piano sound are my main complaints. I haven't heard the original disc, but I can't imagine how bad it must have been if this is significantly better. Four **** if the sound was better."
5,One of the best jazz albums ever!,"There was pure magic at this session, the way Bill and Jim interact together on this CD is one of those special things that just happen. Besides these two being at the top of the class in jazz - and both having produced many, many fine recordings before and after ""Undercurrant"", this one is over the top. My favorite is ""Skating in Central Park"", but all the tunes are great, pure emotion flowing. The only possible negative thing that might be said is that most of the tunes are ballads, and the tempos don't vary that much. However, when somthing is working so well - why change it?"
4,It's a hoot!,"Peter Ustinov is obviously a racing fan, and I can imagine everything in sepiatone as he does all the wonderful voices. The only qualification is that it's insider humor."
2,nice looking but it damaged my visor,"This is a very stylish case and I really like the way it looks. Unfortunately, the cover where the visor snaps in was too tight and ended up damaging the plastic casing on my visor. Handspring happily replaced the visor, and I am going to try a different case, but I'm a bit skeptical....."
3,They Were Better When They Called Themselves Wu Tang,"I felt that this album was way overrated. The production is ill, but the lyrical content is a bunch of B.S. posturing, dudes rhyming about how tough they are in gravelly voices. These guys seem to sort of emulate early Wu Tang without much of the Wu's charisma and humor. But, you can't sleep on the production."
3,The death and destruction gets old,"The tracks off this CD remind me of pre-fame Eminem with better production. The raps are about violence, death, and destruction with little of any socially redeeming value. Initially, they sound like something new and different, but take the pimpin' and drugs out of NWA or Eminem and this is what you've got. Grab some Blackalicious, instead, if you're looking for something with substance."
5,Transcendental Hip Hop,"This was the album that broke me into underground hip hop, and it still stands as one of my favorite albums ever. Everything from the ill flows and haunting, hypnotic beats consume you and grab your attention and don't let up until the album's end. Vinnie Paz and Ikon spit the nicest flows with metaphors and reference all varied sources, especially eastern religion and philosophy. For anyone who appreciates intriguing and thought provoking hip hop, Jedi Mind Tricks is your best bet."
4,"Great album, could be a little better","This is probably one of the most highly reviewed underground CD's ever. Philly's Jedi Mind Tricks can definitely hold it down, this CD is solid. They are definitely capable of better though. I hope that now that they are on Koch records, they can put out a CD that has great production to match their lyrics. There are only a few songs on this CD that have that, the best being Genghis Khan (featuring one of QB's best Tragedy Khadafi). A solid purchase."
5,Don't approach me with this wackness,"I stumbled upon a Jedi Mind track on kazaa and now have over 45 downloaded, including all on Violent By Design.WOW. I can't even comprehend this album. The only album that draws comparison to mind is Enter the Wu. ONly an album of that caliber can capture the true uniqueness of Violent by Design.If you listen to ANY wu get this album. The low tech beats are so reminiscent of Rza's genius and the way the flows are laced on the beats is very similar. The production is THAT DAMN GOOD. i had my best friend listen to Jedi Mind and he asked me if i was high. THIS ALBUM IS NOT FOR EVERYONE. you need to come in with an open mind and be willing to change your tastes in rap and hip hop to listen to the album.Some of the tracks have stayed with me, and keep repeating in my mind. ""heavenly divine"" ""speech cobras"" ""the executioners dream"" are mind blowing tracks.FIVE STARS. NO COMPARISON. JEDI MIND IS THE FUTURE"
1,Sorely disappointing,"The best performances on this album are from the guest artists: Mr. Lif, Planet, Chief Kimachi. The performances from Jedi Mind Tricks and from Virtuoso, Esoteric etc. are not worth listening to. This album is portrayed as ""underground"" but starting with the real-life images of vietnam-style executions that adorn the cover, this CD is mindless, and, in terms of production, unspectacular. I wrote this review to hopefully save people some money (so you can spend it on one of the many bangin' CDs out there). This one is not worth the fiber it's recorded on."
4,Not Bad,"I Just Got This Cd a few days ago and its not that bad. The lyrics are pretty good, and the beat isnt bad either. The best songs on the cd are- 5. Breath of God, 15. Blood Reign, and 19 the executioners dream. If you dont have this cd you should check this cd out."
4,"great production, pseudo intellectual rhymes... great cd","The whole moderately well read MC thing seems to be big in the hip hop underground. Although the references to oeudipus, the bible, shakespeare tend to have little to do with the overall thematics of the songs they are a welcome change from the more gangsta oriented themes of over-the-top violence and misogyny.lots of energy, head nodding rhymes, definitely worth buying. stand out tracks : genghis khan (orchestral sample is off the chain) and death march.Also how often are you going to hear a sample from an Aronofsky film on a hip hop record ?"
5,Dope By Design,"WHAT THE HELL? This album is beyond any superlative I know. Through sheer lyrical panache this album should be a global treasure, and the production is some of the tightest isht i have ever heard in my life. Speech Cobras with Mr Lif has the dopest sample i have heard in a long time. Not only does this album glow with awsome production, but the complexity and intelligence of the word play that they use puts william wordsworth to shame. Not only do they have dope battle rhymes but they rhyme with thought provoking political, social and philisophical theories that make ones brain tingle with delight, and ones ears reverbarate with breathtaking vocal splender. This is one of the greatest records I have ever heard."
4,Just pure madness,"I never really liked rap or hip hop; but the song entitled ""i agasint i"" brings to the audience a type of euphoric outset on life. it really inspired me to listen to more of their music. and i guess it brought out the true meaning of music, where its meant to be an emotion, not heard but only felt."
2,Didn't click for me,"I liked the story's premise, but it could have been a lot better. It was like it was two different books that didn't go together- cute and dirty. I enjoy good erotica, which it tried to be, but the language just didn't fit the sweet story. I couldn't see the characters saying some of the things they did. I also never really felt the love connection either. She was a virgin at 32, come on! She was a modern day professional not a sheltered lady. It was a quick read though, at least it had that going for it."
5,A Lovely book,"Shelly Ware and Kurt Silverman have been friends since Kurt moved to San Antonio. Now both of then are at a crossroads to get move visitation with his son Kurt must have a stable home for him. Shelly has been hearing her biological clock ticking and now with the news that her sister has cancer she wants to have a baby. They both realize that the can help each other with marriage.""A Mutual Favor"" is the first book that I have read by Ann Jacobs but it will not be the last. Ms. Jacobs give the reader a great story with some steamy scenes. This is a book that you will want to keep on your bookshelf"
5,A Mutual Favor,This is a hot and steamy love story. That made me not want to put the book down until I read it all.
4,Good Sea Bean Book,This is a good book. It is scientific & complete with excellent drawings of sea beans. It is a must for any sea bean collector.
2,Creative variety of projects for Christmas,This book contains a good variety of projects with clear instructions and very easy to read graphs. The beaded nativity ornaments project (pages 8-15)is one of my current projects. I've not seen a similar project in any other craft book.
5,Loved this addition...,I love this addition to my Butterfly Meadows collection. It is perfect for pies and bakes very evenly. I use it frequently.I would definitely recommend this item!
5,Excellent Product,"The glaze on this deep pie dish is so distinctively Lenox - beautiful to touch and easy to clean. I've just finished making a delicious Tawny Pumpkin Pie in this beautiful and very practical pie dish. I've received Lenox Butterfly Meadow pieces as gifts over the years but this is the first time I ordered something from this collection for myself. I love to bake. I wanted something extra special for a deep pie dish and this item is visually appealing - and makes a great apple pie, strawberry-almond cream tart, and of course, pumpkin pie. If you a need a nice gift for a baker, this is a good item. I highly recommend it."
5,Is this the #1 JW movie or only #2?,I can't decide if this is the best western ever made or the second best ever! The characters such me in every time they are so well done. Robert Mitchem playing a drunk or Dean Martin.
3,Great western,"They just don't make movies like this anymore, which is why I like these westerns more and more as time goes by. Good guys and bad guys, horses and guns, Robert Mitchum and John Wayne! What more could you ask?Oh,and lets not forget the scene where commie-lib Ed Asner gets pistol-whipped by Robert Mitchum. That alone makes it worth buying."
5,Always Appealing,"I have probably seen this movie about 30 - 40 times, and never tire of it. A great cast, including a rather tender aged James Caan work a virtually mirrored script to Rio Bravo, but somehow make it different. Howard Hawks was so impressed with James Caan who played his ""Mississippi"" role with absolute solemnity, saying that it made his character even more believable during the films many humorous moments. Robert Mitchum is superb, as are Christopher George and Ed Asner, but make no mistake this film belongs to John Wayne. His trademark laconic tough guy style oozes throughout the picture, and as predictable as the movie is, it is an absolute joy to watch over and over again. A worthy addition to any home collection, if you've seen - see it again, if not you're either too young, or you've never watched much TV!. GREAT!!"
3,disappointed,Very disappointed that this was a Region 2 dvd. Now I have to return it. Sender was prompt and packaging was good however.
2,BEWARE OF REGION CODES,"For those who are unaware, pay close attention to videos which come from other countries. The item description should include a Region number. That number must match the number on the back of your video player or you will be unable to veiw the video. I recently purchase a video from Rarewaves in London, England. While the seller identified it as Region 2 and had a note to see DVD format, I think they should have used more ""attention"" focusing words in their listing. Not knowing about the Region thing left me with a video that I cannot watch and would cost me more to return, than I paid for it."
4,short review,very good movie. of course we love john wayne movies. a little slow compared to today's movies but that is part of why we love them. today things are a bit hectic.
4,El Dorado,It would have been nice if the move was not open and a fingure print on it but it is great condetion have not watched it yet so dont know if it skips but my husband was very happy come xmas morning
5,My favorite,The movie was band new as described. It has always been one of my favorite John Wayne movie. I play it it a lot.
5,El Dorado DVD,"One of Wayne's best. All actors involved were excellent and the story-line was the best of all three scenario films. Robert Mitchum, his deputy and James Caan make this action film comedic at times invoking more than just a serious western but an interesting plot that tops all three makes."
4,"Pretty good, but at times slow","The background behind the story is great, and generally the actors did a good job bringing the characters to life. But there were some times where I found myself waiting for things to happen, which to me is an indication of poor pacing in the movie.With that said, my family did enjoy the movie, and watching The Duke again."
3,Classic Western in all it's majesty,"an againg gunman(Wayne)and a Tough sherrif(Mitchum)square off against a ruthless cattle baron. Exciting shootouts throughtout lives up to its predessocr ""RIO BRAVO"" Definatly one of the Duke's all time best. Another highlight in the film is James Cann in one of his earliest performances."
1,dissatisfied,"I was unaware that movies come in different regions. I purchased this movie which doesn't play on my dvd due to incorrect region and I cannot return it, cause that is not a valid reason"
1,El Dorado,"can't rate it because the company will answer me. dvd will not play on my set, can not return it due to the fact the company did not put a return seal inside the package. not happy with this company. do not know what to do, stuck"
3,Typical Western,"This is the tipical John Wayne western. John Wayne and Robert Mitichum give good performances, there is a lot of action, and we all know the good guys are going to win from the start of the movie. Fun to watch, a good time filler."
2,"The Over the Hill Gang. (aka Rio Bravo 2) , widescreen","Mitchum(Baby,I don't care) seems to be having the most fun in playing the part of the drunken sheriff; his performance seemed most convincing.( Overall Dvd quality is good and with fine opening credits.)If they played this for farce,they may have gotten away with it. 2 Spitoons...just for Bob. (This was a hit when it opened way back when so I guess they DID get away with it)Grade B Duke and easy to take.Directed by Howard Hawks."
1,El dorado review,"Haven't been able to enjoy product yet. It was my first time using amazon and I was unaware that you had to order a certain region in order to Play the DVD. Needless to say when I gave my fiancé his gift and we sat down to watch it we were both disappointed when a Region error message appeared and we realized we would have to send it back. The disc did arrive on time though, so I can say they were prompt, I just wish when they saw I lived in Louisiana they would have informed me the particular item I had selected only played in like japan."
1,For Wayne worshippers only,"While I'm not a huge Duke fan, he is nevertheless the kind of actor who I assumed never made ""B"" movies.This is a ""D-.""I've seen worse, but not much. No plot to speak of, but a disconnected scattering of undeveloped and uninteresting sub-plots, dialogue aimed at 12-year-olds, and to call the performances here ""acting"" is being far too generous. Wayne simply struts, talks, gestures like Wayne, Mitchum is his usually bland self, and Caan plays a tossed-in character that doesn't contribute enough (outside of wearing a much-remarked-on hat)to require any acting.Not only will this movie not stay with me, I didn't really know what it was about while I was watching it.Simply awful."
1,"Olag Wieghorst, title song and Ms Holt only reason to watch.",The only reason to keep this very very poor re-write of Rio Bravo is for the maganificent Olag wieghorst oil paintings and the wonderful title song and Ms Holt who is quite hot and delivers the classic line 'I am woman enough for both of you'.James Caan and the costumes are bad especially his stupid hat.Even Olag and Ms Holt could not persuade me to keep this dvd or watch it again.How can Hawks make such a good film as Rio Bravo and then this nonsense ?
4,Good Movie,"This is a great movie, however if you watch Rio Bravo this is just a different twist to it. It this case John Wayne is a highered gun buy a ruthless land owner who wants the water rights his neighbor has as he settled the area first."
3,Strange video message,"I finally got this great movie, when I put into the DVD player this message comes up that the movie cannot be played due to geographical restrictions. I have never seen that message. I can only watch it on my computer, I almost never watch movies on my computer."
1,wrong movie,"This was shipped and sealed in the right movie case but inside the case was the Dreamworks animated children's movie ""The Road to El Dorado""!"
4,Good,Just as I remember it. Got here in a timely manor and was well packaged. It was a bit scratched but worked. Brought back memories from childhood.
5,"Truchanas, Tasmanian wilderness photographs & campaigner","NOTE: Author of 'The World of Olegas Truchanas' is Max Angus, NOT Truchanas.First published 1975 by Max Angus.

3,"Nice concept, raggedy design",the mirror is hard to adjust or see yourself in unless you set the whole thing up at eye level. 2 of the zippers broke within a week
2,Vanity Case,"The mirror was broken when I received this case. I contacted the company and they immediately sent a replacement. The case was not what I expected. It does have a lighted mirror that I was looking for, but the case is way too small to carry on a trip. What with needing make up products and shampoos and lotions the case is just not big enough.I commend them for an immediate response and I would do business with this company again."
5,Makeup vanity,"I bought this for my 14 year old daughter. She really liked it, as it gave her a place to store her makeup AND ease in transporting it. The only thing that would have been better is if had been a bit roomier. Once you put the makeup in it, it is a bit bulky and doesn't look as smooth and neat...a bit bulgy...but you can't have everything!"
2,Wiring,I didn't have this thing on more than once and the left side lights went out. A wiring thing I guess. Cheaply made.
3,An Outstanding Video,"The first time watching this video, I new it was unique, fabulous, outstanding, terrific, great, and all ect., ect., ect. I think that it should/will be a famous name in classics history. Buy it today!!!"
4,Junk food for the brain,"While its true that this show is nothing but a shameless plug to brainwash unsuspecting kids into buying the extensive line of toys for this series (the toys actually came first before the anime and the toys only took off when the show started airing in Japan), I am not ashamed to say that I enjoy watching it ^.^;;;As someone who's a huge fan of X and Senkaiden Houshin Engi I'm sure this is probably strange if not sacrilegious, but hey--you gotta lighten up every now and then and beyblade, while not having the greatest plot in the world (hey, who am I kidding--what plot?) still sets out what it intended to do in the first place--and that is to entertain people, which it does.And to give it credit, the characters are cute and quite lovable. Rei and Kai are reasons enough for me to keep on watching this series till the end."
3,Beyblade anime serie,"I agree that this serie is an toy selling tool, but at the same time, i can't help but to love the cute characters. They are boys with attitude. Afterall, characters are what you watch for in shows that keeps you coming back for more. This serie is definately targeted at a younger audience than most animes. However, even though it's light and funny toned there are some seriousness to it, like Kai's past and evil scientists themes.As for audience gender, this serie would most likely attract boys for the combat nature and lack of more female characters (ok, there are only 3 worth mentioning, Mariah, Hiliray, and Salima). But girls may be attracted to the (again) cute boy characters."
3,Dumb ass fun,Kind of a terminator meets Dawn of the dead- except the whole plot is insainly stupid and if you know that maybe you can enjoy it- especially if you got some friends to make fun of it mystery theater style
3,Good vs Evil,We rented this on a whim and although we had never heard of this film before it was surprisingly good. The characters were thought out and it actually had a plot which so few of the action films that fall in this genre do. I would recommend this to any fans of Constantine.
1,Hmmm Somebody Hates God,Nonsensical and not well done....it deserves all of the poor reviews by Christian and non-Christian alike! Enough said....do not waste your time....unless you just have nothing else to do in the next twenty years
1,"If there was less than one star, this movie would have gotten it",What garbage. Do any of these screenwriters ever talk to real born again biblical believers? I hope the producers don't waste money on a legion 2.
2,Yawn!,"The premise of the film has potential, and there are good actors involved, but the writer and director do nothing with their raw materials. Using a hodgepodge of visual ideas from earlier and better films (Night of the Living Dead, Jacob's Ladder, Tremors, etc.), they render a perfectly predictable and ordinary horror film. There is far too much time spent on quiet moments for the characters to talk about themselves; that would be fine if the conversations or character development were actually interesting or developed, but it slows the movie's pacing down drastically, without giving us any real insight or emotional involvement. There is nowhere a shred of originality, conviction, or humor, and the actors are wasted for the most part, though Paul Bettany manages to find some depth in his character. It's not a bad film; it's just not a good one."
4,Buy it for the fx...,"Ok, the zombies being a punishment from God IS weird, but no more water,remember? I like Paul Bettany a lot and will watch anything he is in, but my main enjoyment of this movie is the full-size ass-kicking angels; also the angel's explanation og angel hierachy from Kabbalah, I think? The acting is good-great cast-and the action staging very good, but I wish they hadn't felt they had to use another baby to deliver the world from it's bad self. Somebody needs to make a movie about some business-apocalypse or whatever- the angel hierarchy needs to take care of--the entire hierarchy EXCLUDING cherubs (gag) and other type goody-two-wings. Full sized tcob angels in cg/performance capture...someone please?"
3,decent movie and plot,"i like this movie with all the talk of the maya calender ending this year i wonder what or if any thing will happen?dennis quaid was good & lucas black was also good he has sure come along way from american gothic,sling blade,friday night lights.the others were good as well."
3,Fun action movie,"Overall, this was an enjoyable movie to watch but doesn't have a lot of replay value"
3,"Entertaining, but could have been more","The commercials made this movie look so good, and it had loads of promise. It started off very well, and though I can't say that the ending was BAD, it was definitely lacking and could have been much more. It's a movie about an angel saving some unborn baby (which has a mom that keeps smoking through her pregnancy, WTF), which was disappointing because I was hoping it would be about the end of the world. Overall it's not a bad flick and has its good points, but in the end, it's not THAT good due to the story unraveling through the film. Eh."
3,Terminator Remake,This movie is pretty good with good visual and action. The zombies are not cheesy or overly done like the others. What makes this movie good is that it copies exactly down to the bone scene by scene from The Terminator 1 movie. Same sequences and everything from start to finish. They are not going to remake/remaster the old Terminator movie. This is as close as you can get for a remake with a different skin. I like Dennis Quaid from his old movies. I am hoping he has a bigger role in this movie.
2,"More Plot Development, Please","Legion is an apocalyptic horror/action movie that centers around the birth of a child and the legions of angels sent by God trying to kill it. The movie begins with the archangel, Michael, leaving God's army and traveling to protect the unborn child at a diner/ gas station in the desert.This movie has decent special effects, casting, and cinematography, but lacks substance. The focus seems to have been on visual stimulation and not a well detailed plot. All of the bits and pieces are there, but the story was not developed enough to give this movie real substance. It is a wax apple compared to a real apple, it looks good and nice to eat, but it doesn't have a real matter to it.I wouldn't waste my time watching this movie; you'll end up not hating it, but not caring about it either. Oh, the movie was really predictable too. I don't like watching movies when I think I could have written it better."
1,Terrible,"What a terrible waste of time and money.The movie has no plot, no charm, no magic.The so called ""angels"" look downright pathetic.I think this movie is just silly."
4,Different end of the humanity movie,"Great change to the regular end of humanity movies, with God using possessed humans instead of a flood to end the human population on earth. Michael and Gabriel the arc angels are at odds about obeying Gods wishes to destroy the human race because God feels there is no hope. Fast paced and gets to the point, cool special effects, and some added gore makes Legion a very entertaining movieLegion [Blu-ray]. Leaves a little to the imagination that could have been filled in with more movie length but otherwise good plot. So the battle is on the save the human race. The Blu Ray disk is always the best way to see movies and this one does not disappoint in clarity and sound quality."
4,FALLEN ANGELS,"LEGION is one of those movies you should probably hate, but I found myself liking it anyway. Paul Bettany plays a heaven-weary archangel Michael who disobeys God's orders to wipeout mankind. When archangel Gabriel steps in to punish him and carry out the order, all heaven breaks loose!The film's setting in a desert cafe is the battleground and a small gathering joins in the battle.Aforementioned plot holes aside, the movie uses its premise effectively with a good cast and visuals. Maybe hokey but fun!"
1,"Implausible, ridiculous and very strange","The entire premise of the film is centered around an angel who decides that God's decision to destroy all humans via demon possessed humans is immoral and risks his life in order to save the mother and her unborn son (who incidentally enough, has powers to save the human race).Once you suspend your disbelief at the ridiculousness of God being so inefficient and messy by using flesh eating demons to kill us off instead of putting on a nice natural disaster, you begin to realize how cliche the characters are, how cheesy the special effects are and how stupid the rest of the plot is.The only cool part of the film was the granny demon. I'll never look at elderly people in the same way again :D"
1,What a mess,"I rented it for $1 plus tax from red box and still feel totally ripped off. It is the worst kind of bad movies, being complete nonsense yet wanting to be taken seriously. So you can't even get a good laugh or chuckle out of it. The whole premise was beyond stupid, and the acting, what acting!? The entire cast, including Dennis Quaid, look to be on the verge of bursting into laughter even when they put up their best effort to look intense. Definitely skip this one."
1,Angels with Fake Wings,"Terminator ripoff.Cheap CGI and sporadic storyline - just jumped around too much to make a lot of sense. Bad guy jumping on moving car roof with knife is so old and when your angels have really bad, fake wings - that's not a good sign from God. Especially, if they also need some armor to withstand the standard issue bullets, knives and spiked clubs. Don't they have any non-human skills?Disappointing."
3,A good action Flick,"as long as you can dig action with only a minimal storyline, in any case found it pretty enjoyable. Will not win any oscars but who cares."
2,A Good Action Movie,*spoiler alert* Legion was overall a good action movie. You do not have to wait long before the movie gets to the plot. But what I did not like about it is that it plays on your intelligence. I highly doubt if someone would be able to give birth and walk around normally a few hours later.
3,Legion,"Good beginning, interesting story line but confused and poor conclusion. Would not watch twice. Worth the price of $3.99, but not much more."
4,Great Movie,I found Legion exciting from the beginning to the end. The special effects were great and the action was nonstop from the beginning to the end.
2,The trailer showed all the great stuff of the movie. Marginally ok for rental but you still will do a lot of fast forward,"The theme that Michael tries to protect mankind against God and Gabriel is great. Pity that everything else sucks. Unless scenes of shooting zombies down can already satisfy you well, you will regret for the time (and money if you buy this) on this when stupid stuff comes one after another in it. The only attraction is what you see in the trailer that the old mum's crawling on the ceiling. Marginally ok for rental, but you still will do a lot of fast forward to finish it."
3,There are some scary scenes that make it worth watching once.,There are some scary scenes that make it worth watching once.I know it's based on a comic book so I don't expect any sense from the plot. The ending is very much the same as many other movies of the same genre.
3,Biblically Inaccurate,"Good action and entertainment, but, biblically speaking, is not sound doctrine. For one, human beings can't possibly fight angels since they are spiritual beings not bound by nature as humans are. Second, though the Bible implicitly teaches free will, it seems that, once that one third of angels followed Lucifer, the two thirds of angels that remained are good ministers of God's plans that have chosen to forever follow God's orders. I have no problem speculating about God and His angelical armies but I think this movie pushed speculation to a higher level.There is no way that Archangel Michael and Angel Gabriel are serving God and be at odds with each other and with God's orders. In Daniel chapters 9 & 10 we see Gabriel and Michael working in one accord. As I stated before, the movie is good entertainment, just don't bet your theology on it."
1,wait for it for 2 dollars on ebay,"This movie looks like it was made in 2 weeks and it is basically shot at one location.Movie is predictable and boring.I went to this at the movie theather and almost walked out it was so bad.Dont pay full price for this terrible movie,it has poor acting and even its CGI is poor."
3,"Legion, with Paul Bettany","I already knew what I might get with this movie; I was right but I'd hoped for more. I first recall seeing Paul Bettany in 'The Tourist.' I saw promise in that performance, but so far, it hasn't come forth. He acts well, so much better than all the so called action hero types foisted on us recently. I wish he would find the right vehicle for his particular talent. Yes, I'm reviewing the actor because that is the reason I watched the movie in the first place. The movie didn't disappoint me because it is exactly what I expected. No real plot, lots of fire power, little thinking... you know the kind I mean. There was only one question, to keep us open. However it wasn't much.Except for Paul, the entire thing wasn't much. LDB"
2,Bow wow from heaven,"The trailers told me this movie was mesmerizing and stylish. Normally, these are empty review words used to describe a bad movie. The movie is definitely stylish; there are good actors in it; and there are some good scenes, but the lame plot and plot twists simply cripples the movie. If you can get around a plot with more holes in it than .... If you can ignore the childish ploys (i.e. Don't open that door!!)... then you might like it. That's a lot of ifs to put up with.If this style and subject of movies suits you, then be sure to see The Prophecy with Christopher Walken. That movie covers the same ground with fallen angels and stylish mayhem and gore but it also explains what is going on and within the scope of the movie, it is reasonably consistent. It's also a lot of fun and Walken steals the scenes as one bad ass angel."
1,....Ehhh...,"....OK For The 6th. Grade Comic Book Reader..(Do Kids Still Read Comics?)..For Adults, It's Insulting & Moronic..!...A REEL STINKER..!"
2,A plot with so many holes,"This movie was watchable, but not very entertaining. Why did angels need to posses people when Micheal and Gabriel were clearly corporeal in the movie? Since when does God ever change His mind? What did the baby have to do with anything? They were all after the baby, yet Michael said that God was exterminating the human race. He said the baby was the last hope, yet the baby played really no part at all in the end-game. This movie didn't seam like a good what-if plot at all because it wasn't well thought out or even well written. With that cast, the writer and director could have made a block buster movie, but instead, the writer chose to release nonsense."
4,Highly Recommended,"This is an excellent fantasy/horror movie. Michael the Arc Angel comes down from Heaven to do battle with the rest of the Angels - going against God - to save the human race. The Angels ""possess"" regular human beings - most notibly the little old lady and the ice cream man - and make them attempt to kill a pregnant woman. It's poignant, touching, and scary all at the same time. I highly recommend this movie!"
2,Two Stars in the New Five,"This movie has been popping up in Netflix for the last couple months and I kept thinking ""this movie looks awesome!"" The cover has everything you could want: Combining Kevin Smith's Dogma with GI Joe and Veggie Tales. I can't confirm the Veggie Tales parallel having never seen it but it was implied in the title. Veggie Tales has angels with SMG's right?So when I saw it had 2 stars I'm like ""i get it... it sucks... thank you world for helping me avoid another movie let down. (No thanks you Tron Legacy... No thank you at all.) But I finally watched it and it was awesome.It was so awesome I am now only going to watch movies that have two stars and I'll go one further and rate all five star movies as a two. Two stars is the new five. Five is the new four. Four is the new one. One is the new three. and three is the new two."
4,Well done,"I though this movie was great. The transformation scene was fantastic. The plot and premise could have used some adjustments, but it was overall, pretty cool.Grab some popcorn and a buddy, turn off the lights and enjoy this apocalyptic fiction piece! Don't forget to confess your sins!"
5,Must have for home library,"In a few places it really creeped me out but in a good way, LOL... great special effects, realistic monsters. and believeable hero's. What more could you ask for in a movie with battling angles. How about zombies, and old ladies skittering across the ceiling of the restaraunt your stuck at . Got your attention that time I bet...LOL"
4,Don't listen to the harsh criticism!!,Watch this movie and determine your own opinion. I was skeptical when I heard about this movie. I watched it and I was impressed enough to go out and buy it after watching it.
3,A Little Knowledge of the Bible is Dangerous,"This is actually a good movie--a movie, not facts. Michael turning against God? Where was he then when the Great Flood was ordered? Angels don't need guns, clubs, or knives. If you think of this just as a movie and not something built with facts from the Bible, it's a pretty good film. Loved the special effects. (Would liked to have known what the baby was going to do to save humanity...)"
2,Zombies used to be fun.,"In the DVD bonus materials, Paul Bettany says he had a blast getting to be an action hero, what with the roles' requirements of kicking butt, playing with weapons, and flipping around doing stunts. It would've been great if any part of that little-boy glee had made it to the screen. Instead, this is a zombie movie weighed down by its shallow religious theme, and there are no moments of lightness for balance. The low-brow cheap fun of seeing the undead taken out by innocent live folks who are trapped and out-numbered is missing. Obviously, angels are just kill-joys."
1,God hates us; the proof is that S/He allowed this movie to be made,"Aside from the special effects in the first five minutes of this movie, there is absolutely nothing good about this movie."
3,Legion: From Pixels to Picture,"Not sure why this is in my ordered list, I never purchased this product.This item is not in my recommend list but in my ordered list..Hm? Whats going on Amazon,,,:P"
2,A is for Abomination: B is for Bad: C is for Cheap:.,"This film is nothing more than another ""zombie kill film"". The writers thought that they would be clever and could squeeze some uniqueness by poaching off the Bible. Although the names are taken from the Bible, everything else seems to be coming from the pit of hell.The cast appears to be quite impressive, and the acting is good. But there is only so much that can be done with a bad script. The plot centers on this pregnant girl whose child must be killed, and why, nobody knows. They just needed something to attact the zombies I guess.To add insult to injury, the 'angels' need to use our carnal weapons, and are quite wimpy. There are some mediocre sound and special effects, but nothing to get overly excited about. In conclusion when watching this movie you feel that you are eating left overs from last month."
2,hoe hum,"not much to it. very far fetched. so, you would think they would go with that. by trying to keep it ""real""it didn't work. some good effects, but not worth the time."
5,Legion,"I was surprised how good the movie was. It had everything you would expect from a horror film, but it also had alot of little messages that I found surprising. It's rare now a day where the movie makers actually make a point in their films. Legions is one of those kind of movies. The message are sudtle but strong. God's love for us, His undying hope in our salvation, the constant battle of good against evil. Those considered less actually being the ones able to save the rest through faith, or inner strength. Putting faith in something greater than yourself, good stuff. So worth seeing."
1,"Watch the trailer, that's it for good stuff","Thankfully I saw this at a free Preview, and I kept wanting it to be so much better. It has a couple (that's 2) interesting attacks/special effects scenes but everything in between seems almost like another made for TV filler episode. I suggest you just watch Constantine or the Prophecy, they are much better."
3,Angels Must Die!,"Legion is a film that had potential to be great, but failed when they set out to make a badass movie and forgot to plug the numerous plot-holes within the script along the way. There are many key elements in the movie that are just never explored and certain underdeveloped aspects that could have been executed better. If you can somehow look passed the several plot-holes and forget all the unanswered questions then you may find yourself enjoying the movie. I wouldn't recommend seeing the movie otherwise."
1,GOD! Dennis were you out of money?,"This is an avoid at all costs. Dennis Quaid had to be unemployed at the time. One of the reasons why I bought this disk.Plot goes nowhere, guns everywhere, No hero, no nothing."
5,add on,bought this as an add on to fill out a super saver purchase. ran across it for $5. what a bargain. and I love the movie.
2,Should have kept the 'CAMP' pedal to the metal,"I don't know if the directors were shooting for cornball campiness to any degree, but there are scenes so goofy , they hint at a sort of over the top campy silliness ala Lake Placid, but not NEARLY as spectacularly brilliant as that movie was. Too bad, the weak story just does not have much gravitas. The ending is a letdown and rather boring. It moves along at awkward pace, and the trailer is more exciting than the whole flick by far. They never explained WHY a pregnant girl in the boondocks, USA is carrying the savior of humanity either LOL. Some of the special effects were cool, but that's about the extent of goodness going on in this stinker of a moive."
1,Wow - waste of 2 hours,"I don't even know where to begin with this review. From the very beginning the cliches started. God bad, guns bad, sluts good, gangster good, ghetto fabulous down on his luck attractive good, pro abortion but having the child anyway good. And that's just for starters. The interpretation of the Bible looks like a connect the dots in this movie. In fact, I really don't want to give this movie review much of my time it was that bad. I want to sue for my 2 hours."
1,Sorry is the word that comes to mind.,"I mean sorry as in, I'm sorry I wasted my time watching this movie. It turns out to be a zombie movie with a couple Archangels who tote a gun, bullets and a mace. wth? They have no supernatural abilities worth talking about. Then the characters die off one by one. Kinda reminded me of how the Friday 13th movies do that elimination thing. They threw in some ""targeted baby wanted for a sacrifice"" kinda stuff. I was totally unimpressed."
1,Worst movie ever!,"This is an extremely lousy movie. It has no storyline, no plot and zero acting.You're wasting your time even reading reviews of this movie ... move on, get a better movie."
4,All about faith,"I had purchase Legion just because I am a big tyrese, and charles s. dutton fan but i got more than i expected it deals with st. michael who is trying to save mankind because god has lost his patienc with us on a spritual standpoint it teaches no matter how bad it is you must keep your faith"
1,Bad,"In my opinion:Plot was laughably stupid. Why would angels be so evil and twisted and kill people? So an angel possesses an old lady, and then the angel wants raw meat and uses obscenities? It doesn't make sense.Again, there is the overused idea of having someone in the group go insane and work against the rest of the main characters.Very long moments of slow dialogue. Little action. Enemy angels are a joke. Ending was terrible."
1,Duped by Trailer!,"Really like Paul Bettany. Did NOT like that the Trailer showed ALL the best scenes! Total ripoff. Zombie like creatures? This is a wanna be 28 days later only with the most lame ""zombified"" things i've yet seen. -1 stars."
2,Again?,"I know Ive seen this movie before. Its like a combo of many Steven King movies, The Grudge, and Dogma. If they didnt use the creepiest scenes in the previews they would have been , well, creepy. Instead it was just boring."
1,Sucked!!!,"I was surprised I stayed awake for so long it was so boring. I noticed it was boring by how long some of the characters were talking. I was so happy when some action would come in. I think it was stupid and didn't have any meaning to it. I know they explained that the things were posessed but, what were they. Like how did they look. An angels in heavy armor and the wings were so fake. Don't waste your time. I just hope that the next one will be better. I know there is going to be a next one. I just hope it's not a waist of time."
1,HOLY CRAP,AND THATS EXACTLY WHAT THIS MOVIE WAS!!!! WHO EVER GAVE THIS 2 STARS AND ABOVE MUST HAVE NEVER SEEN THE PROPHECY A GOOD MOVIE ABOUT THE END OF THE WORLD WITH ANGELS.I FEEL LIKE I JUST LOST 100 MIN OF MY LIFE JUST BY WATCHING THIS FLIK.
1,"Hollywood Industry's ""War Against God""","Pastor Joe Schimmel gave an very enligtening expository critique of this film in the documentary, ""Hollywood Industry's ""War Against God."""" If you get a chance to see this, e.g. Youtube, the expose is worth watching than this film."
3,Starring Paul Bettany,"I am a big fan of Paul Bettany, I do not like horror films. With that said, I did not like the part Paul bettany played and as far as horror, it never scared me. I was suprised to see the word horror in the comments.This did nothing for me,wings? why bother he was really never seen in them for long I do not want to give anything away if you want to see it. It was not awful just disappointing for me."
3,Why are people so harsh on this movie?,"It really isn't that bad. I bought the movie because I got a great deal on it and I was honestly surprised at the quality of it. I wouldn't say this movie breaks the mold on any front but it is entertaining. Warning: this movie is religious! i am not at all religious myself and though the plot was disagreeable on that front the movie was still interesting. Overall, this movie is worth renting, but not buying."
2,"Religious Fever, Turns Into Just Another Zombie Like Movie","After a terrific start Legion whimpers down to just another zombie film, I honestly think they just didn't have the budget for a full scale war from Heaven and a pity too, this could have been so good.Another nice try but no cigar."
3,Angels steal the show,"I know that this movie has mixed reviews, and I, myself, give it 3-3.5 stars. I agree that the script and acting, particularly of the supporting cast, is often overdramatic and awkard. I find the character of Jeep especially annoying. What I find most redeeming about this film, and why I keep returning to it, are the scenes involving Paul Bettany (Michael) and Kevin Durand (Gabriel).These two actors clearly have considerably more mature talent and ability than do the other actors. Their deliveries are powerful, though subtle, and simultaneously emotionally tense. The internal conflict and self-loathing that Kevin Durand expresses without a word is breathtaking. And Paul Bettany's quieter moments, particularly his monologue before Jeep, are scene-stealing and memorable.All in all, this film had immense potential that was wasted with a substandard supporting cast."
2,Mouth Opened Wide in a Yawn,"I really wanted to like this.I was hoping for another fun theological horror film along the lines of ""The Prophecy"" or ""Warlock"".""Legion"" isn't close, actually it's basically a bunch of horror cliches packaged together with an above average cast.Let's go through this paint by numbers flick:1. It seems it's the end of the world (again)2. The only thing standing between mankind and oblivion is a rag-tag group of people.3. The people are trapped in a roadside diner.4. Possessed people talk in strange voices and have black eyeballs5. An unlikely hero emerges6. Throw in a twist endingWhile there are some decent visuals sprinkled throughout the movie, the story is just so tired, if you are a horror fan, you've seen all of this before, and done in a much better way. ""Legion"" doesn't even fall into the so-bad-it's-good catagory, it's just boring.Pass this one up and re-watch ""Prophecy"" with Christopher Walken."
2,Terminator with wings,"My title sums it up. I wanted to like this film, angels, great effects, violence and only a thread of a plot, normally I do like movies that are heavy on the action even if they only have the bare wish of a plot. This one? I kept feeling like I'd seen this story before, it had wings and angels instead of cyborg assassins from a distant future. God instead of a computer program trying to stop the resistance from happening, but at the end, it was Terminator with wings. And not done nearly as well. With the mythology to draw on, with the possible conflict available, it failed to live up to it's effects.The effects were good, but instead of being as creepy as it could have been, it was just gross in parts. The caricatured charactures kept it from ever becoming the scary look at a possible apocalypse it could have been. It just never seemed to quite make it clearly into one genre or another, and failed at all of them."
4,I wanted action and I got it.,"Legion is what a fiction action movie is all about. To add things up, it also has its nice fright scenes due to demoniac's appearances. I was never expecting a high budget, Oscar contender movie but a highly entertaining flick that included all that I have stated above.It wasn't as controversial as I expected, given the theme that angels are the villains, contradictory of everything we have been taught as kids, except for one in particular; Michael, who has opposed God's orders and decides to go against him with the mission in saving a soon to be born baby that destin to save man kind.The special effects fitted very well and the acting was well delivered. A movie to watch if what you're looking for some good action series, and some light disturbing images."
3,Death by Dawn,"Instead starting with people engaging something dangerous that they do not understand, this movie gives a moralistic off screen explanation. There is a slow motion macho angel slug session. Guns and knives work on angels. Sorry if that is a spoiler for anyone. The cast is not exclusively white. There was no comedic content.Other than these details this was very much like a remake of Evil Dead."
3,Pretty good but could be better !,"I wanted to love this movie but at least it was entertaining!! If it was demons instead of angels possessing the living it would of made for sense but what can I say they dared to be different....and failed a little. Oh well,at least it had some good action and ideas."
1,Flat out awful,"This movie was BAD. I went to go see it in the theater because of the trailers but man, what an awful movie. Terrible acting, story was awful, and everything takes place at this restaurant/gas station the entire time (until the end). Save the money DO NOT BUY THIS!!"
1,I am as confused as the plot of this movie....,"We sat down to watch ""Legion"" oh goody a good vs. evil movie, sounded like a good movie night to me. Wrong! Nothing was explained, you pretty much had to figure out the storyline by yourself, if you have no biblical background you are SOL. What I could see of the movie (it's one of those annoying one's where everything is filmed in the dark) didn't make a whole lot of sence. You had great actors playing really good parts in this movie (why did they even take these parts for?) no awards here that's for sure. And since when do Angels need guns?! Can't they just smite people down with a wave of their arms? If you are a die hard end of the world movie kind of person you might just like this movie, otherwise, I would pass."
4,Definitely a different take on the Heavenly heirarchy.,"Very good action, Paul Bettany does his usual great job and I think the story is fairly strong overall. It's worth the 2 hrs of your Life. Don't give up a beautiful evening of hot, steamy and passionate love making for it, but short of that, definitely give this a looksee."
1,15 MINUTES I WILL NEVER GET BACK,"A big steaming pile of you know what. Tale centers around an apocalypse because God has gotten tired with us and decides to have Gabriel and Michael wipe us out but wait there's a savior child that will be born. Are you confused at all? I am. Worse. I have a headache just talking about it. Well, I'm off to take some painkillers but I doubt it will help me recover from this movie. Ha!MY GRADE: F; WHEN WATCHED: don't remind me."
5,Excellent story,"To me, one of the best things about this movie is that it is NOT the typical zombie apocalypse we have all seen too much of nor is it a meteor coming to destroy Earth. For a change it's our own God destroying that which He created, or will He? Yes, this is an apocalyptic religious story. So if you don't want to think that God could give up on man and send His angels down to destroy us then forget this movie. I find it a fascinating movie and exceedingly well done. This movie has a wonderful story, great actors, and an ending that leaves the viewer thinking that all could be well. Even an atheist can enjoy the action in this movie."
2,Silver Threads,"Good for a Saturday afternoon to pass the time - easy to pick up and put down. Very basic, you never lose the plot or forget what is happening. In line with Mills & Boon."
2,Ridiculously small printing- hard to see important detail,"The printing was quite UNNECESSARILY small, and it is very difficult seeing the details clearly with the naked eye on many of the more elaborate fonts. Mr. Headley may have done a nice job putting this book together (the two stars are for him and him alone), but the publisher has cheated both the editor and the reader by apparently trying to save an extra buck where printing costs were concerned. I was extremely disappointed with this volume."
2,THE TYPE IS WAY TOO small,"Very nice book that's just WAY TOO SMALL!!!, it's MORONIC to publish an encyclopedia of ""anything"" that measures 7x7 inches, serifs and other details are negligible.....it cannot be considered a definitive font reference book at this size, THE PRINT IS TOO SMALL!!!!, which is frustrating because that's exactly why I did (or you would) purchase this book. If they make the letters bigger it's a classic, at this size it's almost garbage."
4,"big book, lots of fonts",It is a large book with lots of fonts but the fonts are so small you can hardly see them. This is more of a reference font book than anything.
2,buy a magnifying glass,"This book was very disappointing. I needed different fonts to use in art projects and it is very difficult to see the fonts in this book. The whole book is in miniature, not the size of a normal reference book."
2,This is not a encyclopedia,The Encyclopedia of Fonts it's something like a catalog. I think It will be more informative and deep about fonts
3,Font Book,"This book is full of fonts. It truly has every font I have ever seen in it. However the font sizes are so incredibly small that they are hard to actually look at. I wish it were printed a little bigger, but it is overall helpful."
1,Still waiting for Season 5,"I own the DVD's for the first four seasons of TBAA and love them! I have been waiting a long time for season 5 to be released, and I am very disappointed that something else was chosen instead. I don't intend to buy it. I am still hoping that ALL the episodes for ALL the seasons will be released on DVD. I want to watch every episode that was ever aired. An avid Touched by an Angel fan."
1,ENOUGH IS ENOUGH,Who are we kidding here? Is this a joke? Where are my seasons 5 to 9 that I am desperately waiting here on my little island of New Zealand. Yes for the boycott as long as we need to. Let's be united against this mean idea of drip feeding us with New Age style titles of mere samples of the real TBAA series.
4,I hope it's good,I'm very sorry that they have yet to release the later seasons on DVD Indeed I'd love to get to know Gloria and some of the later angels but please remember these reviews are supposed to be to tell about story and video quality not used copy delivery & such.I'm hoping for these DVDs so I can get captioning. I'm part deaf. Captioning really helps.Alot of full series don't caption. I wish they would.
1,5 for the Series; One Star for this Insult!!,This is an insult to those of us who have invested in the entire DVD collections of this wonderful series! This is NOT what fans of the best drama in the history of television have been waiting for. I will not be buying this set and supporting Paramount with this travesty. I'll stick to watching my collection of reruns which I taped from the original run of the series even though they are old and worn. At least they're complete. Shame on Paramount.
2,Spanish Audio or Subtitle please...,"I love Touched by an angel, the season 1-4 include audio and subtitle in spanish, but this DVDs not include. In my family is super important because all speak spanish. We love the program...thanks!"
4,100th Episode,I just read that this includes the 100th episode which includes Wynonna and Celine Dion. I have been waiting for this one. It will be a two hanky show!
