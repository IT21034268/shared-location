4,Great bang for the buck,These sandals are my daily wear . They are excellent. I bought two of these one in black and one in pearl white . Love them.
2,Where's the Chin Na?,"About 3/4 the book consists of stretches exercises and wrist grab releases. The remainder of the book consists of actual Chin Na techniques, but the techniques are on the simple side."
1,I expected more than what I got,"This was my first and last Martha book. I admit that I'm not that familiar with her work, but I thought I'd get more decorating information than I did. Iwanted her to teach me more about how to use the projects instead of just giving me projects out of context."
1,I had a bad experience,"I spent a few weeks following her suggestions and thousands on the materials. We had a dinner party to show off the ideas I used and some people were polite with compliments. My husband found a few of our ""friends"" laughing at Martha's ideas.A friend later confided that some of the people thought the Martha ideas I implemented were pathetic. I changed most of the things back and my husband was furious. I cried for a week. Maybe she deserves jail time after my experience."
2,"Too much an ""easy buck/taking the lazy way out"" kind of book","It would only be fair to say at the outset that this is not so much a review as it is a caution. If you regularly read Martha Stewart, or even watch her, you'll find this book, like her other book ""Great Parties"", simply a regurgitation of the things her staff have put together for her magazines or shows over the years. If you, like me, have already spent enormous amounts of money on all her previous magazines, this book will leave you feeling, well, cheated. It would be a lot cheaper for you to go through your old Martha Stewart Living magazines, cut out everything you like, and compile them into one big collection. I've come to the conclusion that that's what these books of hers are about."
4,Beautiful pictures and good project directions,"I really like this book. The pictures are beautiful, and the projects are mostly down-to-earth. Anyone could make the lampshades or pillow covers from the instructions she gives. I thought the shelving and picture-hanging sections were particularly helpful."
1,Scratched disc,The first disc was scratched. It was very disappointing. Can you please send me a new one. It would be greatly appreciated.
5,Duck Dynasty,We laughed the whole time. One of the best reality shows of all time. You will fall in love with Sy.
3,quick shipping,"There is nothing wrong with the DVD, the only reason I am giving it low starts is I absolutely HATE having orders out without a tracking number. And unfortunately this was an order not giving a tracking number. Like I said there is nothing wrong with the DVD I received everything was great about that. Just not a fan at all of not having a tracking number. Took about 5 days to get it."
2,it was ok....,I was disappointed to see that I didn't get the bonus disk that should have come with my DVD and it was a burned copy. it wAs not original. I would have been better off going to the store...which at the time was all sold out which is why I got it on amazon. never again.
5,Family Friendly,"I purchased this DVD as a gift for my husband. It has all the episodes plus some extras. For anyone who loves reality TV, this show is a must see. It's family friendly so my kids (ages 5-11) watch it too. It's hard to find child friendly television shows anymore, but this one fits the criteria! Ordering it from Amazon was simple and fast! I didn't have to run from store to store and it was delivered to my door more quickly than I expected it too...even with the free shipping option!"
5,Duck Dynasty,My hunting boys love this DVD. We do not have cable so this satisfied their curiosity with all the talk among their friends. Well put together and great shows.
5,Family fun,"We love to sit together and watch the Robertsons, laughing all the way. This show is good, clean fun. You'll find yourself laughing out loud!"
1,Amazon messed up,"This is a great show and has a great cast and theme. I went to buy it as soon as it came out and when I got it, the episodes are out of order and do not match the episode selection on the dvd. Also the ZZ Top theme song has been replaced! WTF. Amazon did a poor job on this one. Wait to buy it from another company"
5,OMG!!!!!,"This DVD is awesome but you should order a couple of body guards to go with it because everyone will want to steal it! Awesome product; delivered as expected, good quality and has provided hours of great, wholesome entertainment!"
5,Its Duck Dynasty,Of course this product is a big hit! They are halarious and can brighten your day. I think they are worth every penny!!
4,Son in law loves his gift,Bought gift for our son in law. He watched the DVD till after midnight. Loves it!! Looking forward to season two.
4,"GREAT, Jack!!!","I am a MAJOR Duck Dynasty fan! Having lived in LA (Lower Arkansas), we are pretty used to huntin', fishin' and doin' with what you have to make something work. I love this series. Traditional values and just funny stuff, there, Jack! I cannot wait until season 2 begins. The series is great. Now, as for the DVD, I would have given it a five star rating, except that the video listing on the menu DOES NOT FOLLOW what is actually on the disc. Has anyone else this problem too???Anyway, I can watch the episodes over and over again, and again, and still chuckle. Great stuff!!!"
5,Love this show,"I was hooked on Duck Dynasty since the first episode I saw and I knew I had to buy the season DVD to watch at home with family and friends. The Robertson family is great. They have built a million dollar family business and it hasn't changed who they are as a family and as people. Behind those long beards and camo clothing is a family of people with college educations, common sense, and a great sense of family loyalty. Every episode is packed with funny scenes, redneck wisdom and a family that obviously loves each other (although they drive each other nuts at times, as all families do). I love when they get philosophical and the things they say are priceless, true and funny as heck."
3,"Good Show, Satisfactory DVD","The series is very entertaining so I was excited to get this DVD. However, the DVD seems to be out of order. I tried to watch ""Plan Bee"" on Disc Two and it either does not exist, or is on Disc One. Does anyone else have this issue??"
5,Squirrel heads and dumplings,I realy love the show Jase is country as they come. Mr.Phil teaching his grandkids about life and ways to eat off the land if necessary and not from Burger King great stuff. Then theirs Si Hey ! thats says everything you know what i mean. Willie well someones got to be a little normal hey! Mrs Kay you know ive rarely heard of anyone else eating squirrel head good ole frog legs man im hungry! yall do a wonderful job with the program maybe one day ill be in yalls neighborhood and stop in to see a blessed family who belives in God and family untill then keep everybody laughing!
4,I love this show,"I am sure it is mostly scripted, but it is still a great show. The only reason the DVDs do not get a 5 star is the lack of bonus/extra features and footage. It is just the episodes which are rerun almost daily. I thought they might have some behind the scenes footage at least."
1,"Great show, horrible product","Okay, I didn't realize it said DVD-R because I ordered this on my phone and didn't see that description.The picture quality is TERRIBLE. The screen constantly flickers. The video itself is just horrible. The audio is horrible. It's better recorded on my DVR even if you have to skip through the commercials.I feel ripped off for spending $20 on something I could have made myself. I want a proper release.That being said, the show is awesome. This product is horrible.I feel sorry that the Robertsons have to have this out there with their name on it."
2,bad effort from Amazon,"My wife loves the show but too many errors. Didn't realize this was an Amazon dvd-r. Episodes out of order and titles mismarked. I will not buy season 2 from Amazon unless it is an official release from duck commander. Z Z Top music missing, no extras or bloopers of which there must be plenty from recording this show. I sent a comment to both Willie and Jase via facebook letting them know the piss poor job Amazon has done with this show. WTF Amazon, get with the program and do the job right or let someone else do the proper job!!!!!"
2,"Great show, bad DVD","I love Duck Dynasty and pre ordered this DVD. I knew from reading the description I was getting a video Amazon made that would be DVR quality and I was okay with that. What I didn't know is that Amazon would change the intro song and mis-label the episodes! Seriously?! And you can't fix this problem? The DVD has been out for a few months and it appears that they are still selling it with the wrong episode labels! Come on, Amazon! You guys usually do such a good job it makes this one seem even worse!"
2,Image and New Age,"This is a simple DVD with computers animation same as anothers ones. When you see this DVD, you remember another Computer Graphics DVD or VHS. The format is very old:IMAGE and NEW AGE MUSIC."
3,The Chronicle Of Baseball,"This is a book that appears to be a great reference book. However, there are already several erors on my initial review of this book. There are photos that are listed as being from a particular year when in fact they are not from the year listed. How do I reach John Mehno or Deborah Fioravanti, who is listed as the picture research person for this book. If there are mistakes on facts about photos, then it seems logical there are other mistakes."
3,"Great book, substandard Kindle edition","Herman Wouk's great War and Remembrance deserves better copy editing than this slapdash scan job has received. It is distressing when reading a masterpiece to find an error or two per page, all obviously resulting from the lack of a careful human review of the scanned book. Amazon--you owe us a revised copy!"
1,I want my money back.,"This is the worst conversion to Kindle I have ever seen. Don't buy it. Save your frustration and eyes. Buy the paperback version. The people responsible to this unintelligible mess should have to refund everyone who bought this book. The book and the miniseries are great, but this Kindle edition is terrible. Why can't/won't Amazon set standards for their products."
1,Incompetent proofreading in the Kindle Edition,"It's understandable that free e-books from the 19th century would have a few typos, but this is ridiculous. When you're charging money for an e-book, you have a responsibility to make an effort at accuracy. Some of the chapter headings in W&R were originally printed in Fraktur (heavy Germanic script). The worst one I saw was ""Zrandator'O aoreworb"", which was supposed to be ""Translator's Foreword"""
5,Atrocities aren't just ancient history...,"...they're recent history, too. Look at Bosnia and Kosovo. Man's capacity for deciding ""those aren't people"" is not to be underestimated. This book, and its prelude ""Winds Of War"", aren't just a great war story--they're a wake-up call that the phrase ""man's inhumanity to man"" is no mere cliche. And chapter 81's conversation between Natalie and Commandant Rahm should be required reading for those who think that contemporary mainstream American manhood are state-of-the-art in terms of degradation of women. Even a bona-fide ""oinkmeister"" would say ""holy cow!"" at that chapter."
2,Great 5 Star Story- 2 Star Production,"This Review is specific to the Kindle Edition published by Back Bay Books, sold by Hachette.This story, and its companion novel 'Winds of War', are classic WW2 historical novels. Previous reviewers have remarked on the numerous typographic, punctuation, and formatting errors which plague the Kindle versions of both books, especially ""War and Remembrance'. The number of these errors is inexcusable especially when the publisher charges $9.99 each for them.Woulk and Kindle customers deserve a lot better. The material is fascinating, especially for history buffs, but the numerous errors are truly distracting to the reader.Back Bay Books and Hachette need to get their acts together and publish clean, professionally proofed versions of this great series."
1,To the reviewer from Turducken,"Please oh please do not give away the ending as you've done! Or at least warn the reader you're about to spill the beans. I was so looking forward to reading the follow-up epic to Winds of War. Now, half the fun is gone."
5,great book,"the book looked like a brand new one. and enjoy herman wouk, books very much. Brings the war to life for those of us that weren't around then."
4,Excellent narrative !,"I loved the story the author wove around the facts surrounding world war 2. I am usually bored by war books but this one was different. I admit I did occasionally skip the inserts describing battle strategy, but they were unnecessary to enjoying and understanding the book."
4,Love wins again,"As always, Herman writes to the point of love wins over war and deceit and the best man does win, as we knew Pug would."
5,"Awesome conclusion to Wouk""s war epic","I ordered this for my WWII buff boyfriend. I had read this years ago, and knew he would love it. He consumed the whole series with gusto. As well as being a novel about a family before and during the war, the books are historically accurate, and fascinating. Definately a worthwhile read, and a great way to learn about the era."
4,Good sequel to Winds of War,"Herman Wouk wrote a dynamite pair of novels with Winds of War, and War & Remembrance, anyone who lopved those books should read the great new novel that many reviewers have compared to Thw Winds of War, THE TRIUMPH AND THE GLORY. I was very impressed by it and recommend it highly. Although not quite as highly as any of Herman Wouk's books. He is beyond compare."
1,Good Book. Incompetent Kindle Edition,"""Incompetent"" is the politest word I can think of to describe the kindle edition.There are spelling errors on nearly every screen. One of the chapter titles is ""World Solocaust"". Another chapter's title is Midman, instead of Midway.Sample sentence: ""When you come back, and you willy111 be here.""There's about a 50% chance that a 'ü' in a german word will be 'ii' in this edition, as in 'Fiihrer'. I kid you not."
2,"Enjoyed the first book, but the second book is not up to par","Sadly this second book left me unsatisfied. For one, Wouk's misgivings in the first book were well exaggerated in the second. Of course, once one has read through the first book, its hard to stop. Yet, by the end of War and Remembrance I was thoroughly sick and annoyed by Wouk's characters. It's hard to relate to super humans, who constantly do super human feats. Most of the characters in the book come from superior stock, graduate from the top universities, have extremely good looks, and seem to harbour traits that make superman look normal and mundane.I guess after spending endless hours reading the book I am somewhat frustrated. Perhaps you will be like me, and by the second book without pausing. But, for the sake of saving some time, I recommend you consider parting with the characters in book one. Don't make the mistake of buying book two just because book one was so good."
1,"A good soap opera, that's about it.","This title, like it's predecessor, ""The Winds of War"" is full of so many ridiculous situations, as to border on the absurd.To think of a person in the main characters position, to be in these situation, is ridiculous fiction. He always says the right thing, to the right person, makes the right decisions, at the right time. Always. Pug, the omnipresent, clarevoyent, far-seeing, all knowing naval Captain, giving advice to world leaders who figuretively slap their foreheads while saying, ""Pug, you're so right, why didn't I think of that ? "".........yeah, right.Also amusing is how he and his family always have sumptious meals of steak, seafood, fine wines, etc., during wartime shortages and rationing.Both books are full of such contradictions, over and over and over......Both books are amusing entertainment, though in a very shallow way, but to take them serious, is a mistake."
4,Get your Tweedy fix,"I've been a Wilco fan for years, and love everything Wilco related. But no side projection/incarnation has captivated me the way the Loose Fur project has. The Tweedy/O'Rourke combination is unmatched in indy rock today, in my opinion. In a time when any yahoo can make a record in their bedroom with plug-ins and the like, the Loose Fur records are minimal-production marvels that allow the songs to speak for themselves. And they are amazing songs. In many ways (and I expect a ton of flack for this), better than some of the recent Wilco stuff."
3,Great pop,"***1/2 - I really hesitated picking this up after being so disappointed in A Ghost is Born, but I'm glad I did. Most of the songs come in at around 3 minutes, which is part of their charm. This is good, fun, breezy pop rock. And given the material, I don't even mind O'Rourke's voice all that much. Somehow it fits on ""Answers to Your Questions"", which offers a nice slower tempo song amidst the lighter tunes around it.The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars is because of ""Wreckroom"", which features great 70s style guitar work but is eventually marred by the irritating wall of noise guitar style that, for me, ruined much of Ghost. Take that out and lop off the last 4 minutes of the song, and it would be my favorite song on the CD."
4,Great little side project for Tweedy and Kotche,"This album is an album, not the noodling and sketches of greatness that could be that the first Loose Fur album was. Highlights are 'Hey Chicken', 'The Ruling Class', 'Apostolic', 'Thou Shalt Wilt', which sounds like Jim O'Rourke's take on a Schoolhouse Rock number(that's a compliment, really!), and the album closer, 'Wanted'. I like the cross between O'Rourke's folksy numbers and Tweedy's more straight ahead rock, even progressive sounding in 'Apostolic'. And I can't say enough about Glenn Kotche, other than he's a percussion genius. The one exception is 'The Ruling Class', which I think should have been on a Wilco effort, EXCELLENT SONG FOLKS!! Buy it...Enjoy it....Love it!!!"
3,just a footnote,"Hi everybody. A couple of the reviews here mention ""Thou Shalt Wilt"" as a song about numbers from 1 to 10. So far as I can see, nobody understood that it's a take on the Ten Commandments. Should have been real obvious by the end of the song: check out the last line."
4,Listen to Track 10,Listen to track 10 please. Amazing lyrics. The record is worth getting for this alone.
2,This is no reference tool.,"If all you want is quotes, you will enjoy this book. If, however, you need a reference tool that is accurate, look elsewhere. About one in three quotes is misquoted, misattributed or both. Citations following the quotes only include the authors' names, so why is the book so full of errors? Clearly, little research went into this ""reference"" book. How appalling that it was published by a major university!"
1,Don't Mistake the Name for the University Press!,"This is not a true reference book, and should not be confused for one. You have to read the label, folks! It was NOT published or, heaven forbid, conceived by Princeton University. It is a Dell publication -- just another little ole paperback out on the market looking for sales because it's got ""nifty"" quotes from ""relevant"" personalities and celebrities of the day. Oh, and some ""heavier"" quotes from famous dead men of the Western world. Hey,I'm from the Western world too -- only not a dead man (or a live one either, for that matter). And if some of the sources are wrong, well-- it's not supposed to be real research anyway, right? No,wrong!"
5,Pale Saints' Best Album,"If you've never heard Pale Saints, this is probably the best first album to get. It is the most accessible and etherial of the all, and the last album before a line-up change saw the departure of one of the founders of the band. This means that the Pale Saints of ""Slow Buildings"" is essentially a different band, and with lifeless songs.The songs on this album work together to be more than just a collection of songs. Some may say that ""The Comforts of Madness"" is a better album, but I found that one not as well produced and the songs not as good compared to this one. On ""In Ribbons,"" you have female vocals on several of the songs, which works very well with the etherial guitar arrangements.Also, check out ""Blue Flower,"" which the same song that Mazzy Star did on ""She Hangs Brightly,"" but with a completely different, more etherial feel to it. However, the band sound nothing like Mazzy Star. If you like Lush and the Cocteau Twins, you should get this album."
3,A Jump start......,"This had to have gotten others to think. We jump on the bandwagon of ""easy"" blessings. Never having read a parody of Christian literature -- this is the answer for those who refuse to read a SERIOUS critque of ""questionable"" books. thanks...."
2,"True premise, poor delivery","There's not doubt in my mind that Wilkinson's Prayer of Jabez is on theologically shakey ground (which is why I was interested in reading this book). However, so is the smarmy sarcasm of this author in response to Wilkinson's errors. Clearly from scripture we are to confront false teaching but it is to always be tempered by the fruit of the Spirit. Sarcasm is not listed in my Bible as part of the fruit of the spirit. Straightforward apologetics is certainly called for in the face of false teaching but to build a ministry around sarcastic parody is quite frankly not Christlike. The author also obviously has some theological axes to grind beyond what is covered in the Prayer of Jabez which come through in this little ditty as well."
1,awful,some people have way too much time on their hands...the Prayer of Jabez is an awesome book.James 4:2
4,Long story told in detail,"I learned a lot from reading this book, which is actually a seminary text. The prose is somewhat pedantic at times, but still readable. It is a good history of Christanity in England and surrounding lands. I learned a lot about the balance between church and state, and how Angicanism has gotten to the point that it has. I would recommend it for anyone interesting in the history of England as it is more than just a text about the Church in England. For Episcopalians, it helps in an understanding of the current crisis in the Anglican community."
4,"Worth 5 stars on acting, but...","""Ray"" is a better-than-good movie. Unfortunatly it is merely better than most instead of great. The acting is incredible as Mr. Foxx IS Ray Charles. Showing his childhood in a series of flashbacks, as opposed to seeing it all at once at the beginning of the movie, was effective in keeping the viewer wanting more. The only knock against the film in my mind is the lack of theme. What one thing does his life, in this film, teach us or make us feel? ""Work hard no matter your limits""? ""Treat your loving wife better than your mistress""? ""Don't do drugs in Canada""? The last few minutes devolve into an ABC Afterschool Special. Very interesting man. Less than perfect film."
1,Shame on Amazon,"Blind people who might enjoy this movie are forced to pay an additional $4.50 to obtain the DVS version. Some in the blindness community would consider this discriminatory. R. Kerr, So. Maryland Council of the Blind"
1,I simply do not get it!,"I dont understand all of the hype about Jamie Foxx. His performance wasn't that good and it wasn't anything that I have not seen him do before. He is not in the same league with Depp, Eastwood, DiCaprio, and Cheadle. These guys are real actors who have been in many good movies. Jamie Foxx does like two good movies and people are throwing their panties at him and praising him like he's the best actor ever! I personally think Leo DiCaprio should win the Oscar this year because his performance in 'The Aviator' was so good that it should not be passed up by some comedian. Jamie Foxx is an impersonator not an actor. Besides, this movie was only popular because Ray Charles died."
1,Bad movie,"I saw the movie a few days ago with a friend, because we heard so much good stuff about this movie.But we didn't like that movie at all. We thought it was boring and Jamie wasn't that good, like everybody said. He was ok, but not that good to win an Oscar. Leo is much better in ""The Aviato""."
2,for the music alone,he played a blind black man.hes black.the blind part isnt the hardest of afflictions to portray.he will probably follow up this gift by showing up in catwoman part 2.
4,Jamie Foxx in the Role of a Lifetime,"Jamie Foxx made Ray Charles come alive in this film. The life of Ray Charles is/was quite an interesting one. Coming from humble beginnings to the legend he became I couldn't help but be engrossed. The only thing that really bothered me was that it just seemed to go on and on. Throughout the movie,I just couldn't help but wonder when Mr. Charles was going to check into a rehab center. The life of Ray Charles was a life that many dream to have but with turmoil that you'd never wish on your worst enemy.Jamie Foxx brought Ray Charles alive again from his walk,talk,and to the way he played the piano. Jamie Foxx was Ray Charles and I found myself sometimes forgetting that Foxx was only playing the character of the great legend we so love. Foxx deserves every award nomination from this film. Job well done in the role of a lifetime."
3,"Great picture quality, plodding storyline",I'll admit I don't know much about Ray Charles and I'm not sure how much I do know now that I've watched this movie. I never trust Hollywood to tell the unembelished truth when it comes to fact based movies. But from this movie Ray does not come across as a very likeable guy. I never knew he was a heroin addict and a womanizer with fleeting loyalty for friends. But Jamie Foxx does a great job convincing me he is Ray Charles.The problem with this movie is that it is just too long and drags in several spots. How many flashbacks to his childhood do we really need? The story covers Ray's life up to the 1970's and it feels like it does so in real-time. At least the HD DVD transfer is very good with great picture quality and an awesome soundtrack. But this is just a rental for me.
5,R A Y,"IN THE FIFTIES . . . when the other kids were out-side, playing, I was inside . . . Listening to YheGreat RAY CHARLES. It came to be, that the more Iheard about him --- the more I wanted to hear about him.IN the Year 2000 . . . in Akron OHIO, I finally gotto see -- in person --- MY Childhood Idol. This moviemakes losing him,some Fifty years later, bearable . . ."
3,Over Rayted,"Yes Jamie Foxx does a good job, yes Ray Charles was one of the giants of the second half of the twentieth century, and yes ""Ray"" is one of the better movies of 2004, but it does not live up to the hype.Foxx's impersonation is a good one, but I've seen comics doing that blind musician head rolling thing forever.While Charles' genius is emphasized and his boorishness to his wife, his mistresses and his managers is glossed over.For too long the film dwells on the obvious, and in a didactic way it goes on and on about the evils of the segregated south and heroin addiction, and the decency of a loving mama and a long suffering wife.Once youve sat through it once, you will see it, as The Man said, ""no more, no more, no more, no more."
2,The Music Will Stand Forever....,"....but the film is subpar, TV fare. While much has been made of Jamie Foxx's performance, the fact is, he teeters between comedy and being an outright minstrel. The strongest supporting role accolades go to the underrated Clifton Powell as longtime road manager/assistant Jeff, the man who keeps Ray grounded and in touch with his morals and obligations. As I stated before, the music is timeless and never goes out of style and a documentary about the man and his creative process would have served his legacy better than this fodder, but since audience expectations are so low and the Oscar race/hype machine has to start somewhere, ""RAY"" is as good a place as any. Vastly Overrated."
2,"""Ray"", Not the Best","The movie, ""RAY"" was not the best movie I saw and was one of the worst I saw! The movie is 3 hours long and all the scenes are like 10 minutes each. BORING!!! I do have some advice for one thing that JAMIE FOXX did an unbelievable job in the movie and deserved, Best Actor! Some of the things in the movie don't even take place in Ray Charles's real life! Do not see, rent, or by this horrible movie!PEACE OUT, A-TOWN DOWN!"
5,Excellent film...one of the best of 2004,"Genre: Bio-Pic Drama/MusicalGenre Grade: A+Final Grade: AThis was an excellent movie. It was much more serious-toned than I thought it would be, giving a strong glimpse into adultery and drug addiction and also gives a horrific glimpse into Ray's childhood. The movie is also uplifting with the story of Ray finding his own sound, and just all the music in general. Definitely worth seeing (and worth sitting nearly three hours for), and although the conclusion of the movie feels very rushed and unexpected, it has such a strong body and introduction that make it worth it. Jaime Foxx was amazing in it, and I've got my bets on him for taking home the Oscar next year. There were seriously a couple of moments in the movie where it almost seemed like they inserted some old footage with the real Ray Charles in it because he stepped into the role so well. Great movie, see it!"
5,Foxx shines,"This movie is good because of the script and cinematography. This movie is GREAT because of Jamie and the music. Long movie, but moves along great. Worthy of purchase."
5,Outstanding,"A great performance by Foxx, who is completely convincing as Charles, along with songs from Charles's original recordings for the soundtrack, make this movie both a dramatic and musical treat. Beginning with Charles's early childhood and continuing up through his later years, the movie shows Charles as a complex man who was not only blessed with amazing talent but was driven to succeed and overcome all obstacles even as a boy, despite his blindness. The movie also doesn't shy away from the dark side of his character, showing his struggle with drugs and his philandering ways with women on the road. But overall, it's a beautifully done portrayal of a great musician and composer who single-handedly transformed the pop musical scene during his lifetime. Definitely worth your time and money to see if you're a fan (and even if you're not)."
4,"The good, the bad and the ugly...","The Good:Jamie Fox's performance is bizarre in it's believability. I felt like I was watching the real Ray Charles. His oscar was well-deserved!The Bad:The movie only covered the first half of Ray Charles' life and didn't seem to have any other point other than to show that Ray Charles wrestled with personal demons and overcame his blindness to become successful in life. I was disappointed that we learned almost nothing about who Ray Charles really was, especially in his later years.The Ugly:The movie is WAY, WAY, too long! Three hours of little more than RC playing in clubs, doing heroine and hitting on women. If you fast-forwarded past the middle third of the movie you wouldn't miss much.Overall:JF's performance makes the movie well worth watching.:)"
2,"4 stars for movie, 1 for DVD","I agree with all the negative comments made about the so-called ""extended"" edition. Talk about half-assed production and false advertising. Shame on you, Universal."
4,It's the music,"The man may not be the greatest husband or father, but his music makes him unforgetable. The acting is beyond mimicry. It is uncanny. If you know the music, you will never hear it the same way again, If you don't know the music, where have you been? Come on, get ready to dance."
1,one star for Jamie Foxx,"Jamie Foxx does a good job of inhabiting the character of Ray Charles, but the film is just the stock standard Hollywood story of fame and excess we've seen a million times before. It's thoroughly embarrassing. The rags to riches trajectory, the hyper-indulgence in lavish living, the drugs, and oh, he has a taste for the ladies - what a clever plot twist. Of course he rises above it, kicks the drugs (with perfunctory tough love from a doctor in the clinic). Ray plays like the most predictable VH1 Behind the Music segment - wholly unoriginal, stepping hard on every cliché. Over-hyped drivel and an absolute must miss."
5,PROPS!!!! Jamie Foxx,"I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and Jamie's performance. He captured Ray's essence! I know Ray blessed the movie and Jamie's performance. Jamie's acting in the latest three movies (Redemption, Collateral and Ray) has shown the depth of his ability. I also commend the entire cast. Regina King has certainly come into her own as well."
5,One of the Best Movies I've Seen!,"WOW!! I had heard how good this movie is, but didn't realize it was that good. We saw the DVD for the first time over the weekend during a dinner party at a neighbor's house. We were all very impressed with the tremendous struggle that Charles had to maintain, with the discrimmination, especially in the south. Even some Afro-Americans were taking advantage of this blind black man. Not only was he a musical genius, but also a survivor!I found it troubling how much Charles got caught in spider webs of drug abuse and unethical women, bound to get a hold of some of his fortune. I was surprised that he had 12 children, many out of wedlock? All an all, his life was success, because of the joy of music he brought to millions and millions around the globe. I will never forget how Charles could deliver the song ""America""...how he could make me shed a tear every time he sang that great song.I hope this film wins many awards. It deserves a lot of praise!"
4,"Great performance, good movie...","Ray features a GREAT performance in the middle of a GOOD movie. I suppose that this is probably they could've made from the life of Ray Charles. It's not that Ray Charles isn't interesting enough - it's that he's too interesting. How do you squeeze a fifty-plus year career into a two-and-a-half-hour movie? (The movie FEELS very long.) So, the movie focuses on the broad arc of Ray's life. The themes in the movie are Ray's constant infidelities, his addiction to heroine, and the question - how can a blind man every really trust anybody? I won't go any further into Jamie Foxx's performance - he should win the Oscar. It's only a shame that Ray Charles didn't live long enough to ride the high of his newly-restored popularity."
5,"""Georgia On My Mind."" Ray Charles. The Man. The Music. The Legend.","The Oscar-winning bio-drama on Ray Charles, who died in June, 2004, shortly before the film's release is an absolute work of art, highlighted by an Academy-Award winning performance by Jamie Foxx (""Collateral"") as ""The Innovator Of Soul, Ray Charles."" The film centers on Ray from the mid-1940's to 1971, interspersed with flashbacks of his childhood, not attempting to sanitize Ray's life. Taylor Hackford (""La Bamba"") is very meticulous in depicting the era covered in the film. The production values are excellent. GREAT performances from the entire cast, especially Mr. Foxx.The DVD edition features two versions of this heartwarming biography: the theatrical cut and the Extended Edition, featuring 14 additional scenes not shown in theaters. Rated PG for thematic elements, depictions of drug addiction and some language."
3,25 mins. to long,"I'm always into biography type movies and this one was pretty good.It was just 25 mins to long for me.They could have cut anice chop of the dryness.Jamie Foxx , does look like Ray Charles.He does a very good job acting , but I wouldn't buy this movie.It's actually worth 4 stars but I didn't give it to Ray because of the extra minutes of nothingness"
3,Great Musician....boring movie,"Ray Charles was a great musician, no doubt about that. But his ""life story"" in this movie is just boring. 1949 got noticed, found heroin, slept around, did heroin, got married, did heroin, cheated with backup singer, heroin, made it big, heroin, etc....1965 quit heroin, end of movie, oh yeah 1979 Georgia did something....that's it? Best movie of the year? Not even top 10, best actor? Not even top 15. More music and more about who this guy reall was would have helped. Not just Foxx impersonating him and scratching himself because of...you guessed it, heroin addiction. It wasn't horrible but I expect more out of best movie nominees and more of the great art that made this guy so interesting.Hit the road Jack."
5,Oh my god!!!!,What alien took over Jamie Fox's body and turned him from a good actor into one of the world's best. Jamie did Ray just as good as Val did Jim Morrison. It was the most amazing piece of acting work I have seen in years. I raise a glass to you Mr. Fox and the cast of Ray.
4,"Ray, A Life of a Black Blind Man","The movie Ray describes a man's life who lost his sight atseven years old, however, gifted an inherent talent in music. Althoughhe grew up in a poor family, he struggled to survive in thewhite-centric American society which was too crucial for a coloredblind man to live. At last, he made a great commercial coup in themusic industry and recognized as a famous million-selling musicianall over the world.One of the most impressive scene to me was that byovercoming his childhood trauma, he finally succeed in withdrawingfrom heroin as he promised his family and the public. On the otherhand, this movie exaggerated a man's life aiming at a dramatic effect,which makes a little difference between his real life and the story ofthe movie itself.Ray is a success story giving a message that all careers areopen to talent even a man of humble origin. I recommend this movieto people who experiencing great hardships or lovers of soul music."
3,"Impressive biography, great music","The movie is a little long, and concentrates on Ray Charles' rise to popularity. It ends rather abruptly about 30 minutes after it gets a little tedious.Highly entertaining, and approved by Ray Charles before release, I can't help thinking that the subplot about the death of his younger brother is more Hollywood than reality.A good trip to the cinema, and probably a good rental in the future if you have a good sound system."
2,Dont believe the hype.,This movie wouldn't have got the recognition that is has received if Ray Charles were still alive. The movie is mediocre at best and Jamie Foxx's performance is lackluster. Just because he is a good impersonator doesn't mean he is a good actor.
1,defective,"Product was not as described, skipped repeatedly and pixilated. Lost more than 20 minutes of movie to get past damaged part of disc."
3,"o.k. but mediocre, not great","O.K., not great, mediocre as far as a film goes, and the performance is mostly twitching and funny teeth action. Hard to see how this could have stood a chance of getting best film/"
5,Best Picture of the Year!,"I know a lot of people had problems with the extended version of the DVD, but it warns you that it might not play well on certain DVD players. It didn't work well in my PS2 either. However, you can watch the extended scenes in the deleted scenes part. Anyway, the movie was great. I guarantee that Jaime Foxx will win at least the Oscar for this movie. It showed how his life really wasn't as great as some people thought it was. He may have seemed happy a lot, but struggling with his brother's death and heroin addiction wasn't exactly a perfect life. And for people who say that the movie is bad because it just shows him womanizing and taking drugs, well, that was part of his life. I'm not sure if he actually got to ""see"" the movie before he died, but I'm sure he would be pleased with the outcome."
5,i'd give it 6 stars if i could......................,"magnificent, electrifying, brilliant masterpiece! foxx is absolutely incredible, as is regina king and the entire cast. i got my deluxe 2 disc set this morning with about 100 folks in line waiting for the store to open-well worth the freezing cold! the film runs every gamut of emotions, and, of course the music is so triumphant-and foxx plays his own piano. my only minor complaint is when you choose to view the extended version-the screen will go black for a moment, then on to the next scene. the digital transfer and ac-3 sound are both marvelous. this one is a keeper, my friends, do not miss it as it's a must for your dvd library. kudos to all involved. a great film-with greater performances!"
5,Ray was Excellent!!!,"Ray Charles was from my parents generation; he was ok but I was never a huge fan. I mainly went to the movie to see Jamie Foxx. I was shocked to hear some of his early songs - I never knew they were his. That combined with Jamie Foxx's excellent portrayal made me love this movie and Ray Charles. Don't get me wrong, I didn't love the things Ray Charles did, but I feel like I got to know him. His independence was impressive, and he was a very smart business man. If you're a fan of music, enjoy dramatic movies and like to pull for the underdog, this is the movie to see. Great pacing, great casting and great acting. I certainly plan to add this to my DVD collection. Jamie Foxx should WIN best actor this year. Hopefully the academy will give the Oscar based on each actor's current performance and not all the other crap they mention when justifying why someone was overlooked."
1,Don Cheadle was robbed!,"Was this film supposed to be funny?I found myself laughing at the obvious ""impersonation"" of Ray Charles as opposed to the acting that was required.The fact that a brilliant actor such as Cheadle could be passed over for this obvious piece of pure hype is enraging.The only thing that would have made this film better is if we had seen Foxx re-creating Charles's appearance in Spy Hard. ""Next stop Melrose...I think"""
1,Wake me up when it's over!,"Instead of making a tribute to Ray Charles, this film portrays Ray as a very unlikeable person. It was very disturbing to watch as a fan of Ray Charles. It is safe to say that Ray Charles himself would have hated this movie. It was so long and painfully slow! Whatever you do don't buy it! Buy a Ray Charles CD instead."
4,Finally!,"Finally a music- bio pick that does not disappoint like ""De-Lovely"" or ""Beyond on the Sea."" Ray focuses on how Ray Charles came to be one of the greatest singers/song writers of all time... never distracting from true spirit of the man.The songs are well-performed and unlike so many other music bio-picks fit well in with the story and pop up at approiate times.The story is well-written true to the man it depicts. Showing and telling all including the warts in Ray Charles past from things he like to forget such as the drowning of his brother that he witnessed, to his drug addictions and multiple affairs.Jaimie Fox is Ray and it's hard to believe that he is not actually the man he is portraying. He got a well-deserved Oscar for his performance and is quite a singer in the movie.I left the theater amazed by the power of Ray Charles and his difficult struggles.This is a movie not to be missed by any Ray Charles or music fan- definately hit the buy now button and become charmed by Ray!"
4,Stellar Performance!,"This is a stellar performance by Jaime Foxx. The film, however, is not as good, and drags along in many spots. There are the usual stereotypes with drug use, seeing the light on Jim Crow, nasty and racist whites, money-grabbing friends, and so on. But Foxx saves it. He certainly deserved that Oscar! It is a worthwhile movie with which to spend your time . . ."
4,An exceptional biopic,"""Ray"" is a remarkable biopic of legendary songwriter/musician Ray Charles. It avoids many of the pitfalls that bedevil most movies of this type. After all, it's difficult to synthesize the life of a very famous person into a movie that doesn't run so long an audience can't sit through it. [""Ray"" runs 2 hours, but doesn't seem long at all.] You have to resort to cliches to keep the dramatic movement going. ""Ray"" does have its cliches and its pop psychology, but these are overwhelmed by a focus on Charles' music and by Jamie Foxx's portrayal of Ray, which is so good that there simply is not another choice for this year's Best Actor Oscar.Nominated for 6 Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Actor and Best Director."
5,What a beautiful movie!,"""Don't you let no body, nothin', or yourselself make you a cripple!"" It brings tears into my eyes everytime I remember his mom saying that! She should have been a heart-broken woman who lost one of her bundle of joys to drowning and saw the other one go blind from glaucoma! Nothing could have been harder for a mother. But she was a strong, couragious woman who helped her son and watched over him even long after she was gone! I loved his mother! Sharon Warren, who played Aretha Robinson(Ray's mother) touched my heart, I guess she should have got an oscar too!Ofcourse, Jamie Foxx did a superb job with this movie."
4,Very Interesting,"Very good movie, that is based on the life and struggles of a very talented man, who overcame very many obstacles."
5,An atheist raving about a fantastic collection of gospel?!?!,"Don't pray for me. I don't believe that there is a God but I have no interest in convincing others I am right.However, I am here to tell you that whether you are secular or religious, if you like 'real' blues this album is a must-have. This is one extraordinarily talented group of hard-driving bluesmen passionately driving home their message of faith, hope, and love. These guys are the real deal!"
5,Voices of the Valley Encore,"I ordered this cd by mistake and thought about returning it but listened to it and I changed my mind. I love to hear male choirs and this one is absolutely beautiful. I have ordered another cd by this same group. This is one of those cds that you could just recline with a nice cup of hot tea, close your eyes and relax."
3,"Great voices, monotonous album","What can I say, great voices, but all the pieces are the same; full on singing of each song, no inflection or emotion."
1,A sea of eternal wanderings,"This book has left me with more questions than answers. I'm new to OOP and this book certainly has not helped. The book said it was for ""Beginning programmers"" but after chapter 3 it assumes you magically know OOP concepts. It left me flipping around the book, searching for definitions.I've purchased other Wrox books before and have been pleased in general. For some reason Wrox dropped the ball on this one. It's as if the book was written by three authors at different times and then compiled into one book, without regard for what you have or haven't already learned in previous chapters.I wish there were a rosetta stone for new beginners to make the bridge to .Net. Until then I'll be searching for a better VB.Net book."
1,How did this book get 5 stars by other reviewers,I am a seasoned programmer learning the .NET platform. At first this book seemed okay...the layout was pretty good and I found their presentation methods easy to learn from. Then I started running into some serious coding problems. Their ASP code examples are outdated and riddled with errors. No error errata on the website either to fix anything I saw. I spent more time trying to fix their stuff than I did acutally learning. It would be a good book if it wasn't for all the errors. They desperately need some technical editors... I wouldn't recommend this book at all.
3,A shallow beginner's book,"As the title indicates, this book is for beginners. The first 3 chapters assume that you have no programming experience. Many simple examples are followed by only decent explanations.""pass in parameters by reference using byref. This is an advanced technique, and is beyond the scope of this book.""I never considered ""byref"" an ""advanced technique""; it is an important technique that should have been covered, if only for a few pages.Chapter 15, ""Accessing Databases"" and chapter 16, ""Database Programming with SQL Server and ADO.NET"" were extremely shallow. If you're interested in learning to access a database, you'll need a different book/resource.Overall, I am Disappointed with the book."
1,-5 stars,"Really what I have to say has already been said by others and Rosey puts it nicely when she says ""Most of the material is covered in a superficial, rushed manner."" and ""The treatment of ADO.Net is pathetic.""For anything truly substantial on VB.Net do yourself a favor and look elsewhere; what a waste of money this was. If I could give this book a -5 star rating, I would."
3,Not as good as I had hoped,"I looked this book over pretty well at Borders before buying it from Amazon, but was unpleasantly surprised once I began to read it straight through. Critical information is omitted from some topics. Continuity seems illogical. And the website, though expertly administrated, has a small subscriber base. The book is not very well organized and is carelessly written. For twice the price, the Deitel offering is ten times the tome."
4,Good learning guide...,"I loved the sample and explanations on XML serialization as well as the topic on collections. What I didn't like was the their discussion of objects esp. the example - a CAR. It could have been much helpful if they had stick with the customer and bill classes. Overall, I can recommend this to programmers with experience on other languages, and it would help if you know already the basics of objects, as the discussion on classes will only be on Chapter 10. If you are a novice or VB beginner, I would advise you to buy a second book to support your learning together with this book. A good second book will be an Apress book.If you want a thorough OOP tutorial, buy Daniel Clark's Beginning OOP using Visual Basic 2005."
4,check out the OO material,"VB is widely considered one of the easier ways to build a GUI. Its latest incarnation is described here. The authors show you how Microsoft has tweaked it into the .NET framework. The teaching pace is deliberately measured. For example, in a chapter on making menus, the steps are set up in considerable detail, with many screen captures. The authors take little for granted in your programming background.The size of the book partially reflects the many diagrams offered. Since these can be very useful and reassuring to a new programmer, it is a good thing that the authors are so liberal in furnishing them. But the size is also a measure of how far VB has come from its Basic roots. VB now has strong object oriented capabilities, and several chapters use this. More for you to learn, of course. But in the long run, it might help your coding habits."
5,"Starts Simple, Goes Complex., Stays Microsoft","Visual Basic has now been around for some fifteen years. Through several versions it has progressed to be a fairly complex, fairly powerful language having been extended into the .NET family of languages, database connectivity, web functionality with both HTML and XML.At 800 pages, this is a large book. It starts quite simply doing a little program where you type in your name and it comes back with a 'Hello' statement. From there it goes step by step to fairly complex programming using Microsoft's ADO.NET interface to talk with SQL Server.Microsoft has established this programming evironment where everything about the language, the editor you use to program it, the utility routines you call on, the database you access has to be Microsoft product. This book fits into the 100% Microsoft environment. If your database is MySQL, this may not be the way you want to go. On the other hand, Microsoft rules the desktop environment so it may not be a bad idea."
4,Slow starter,"The book starts out a little slow for those who program in any other IDE but seems to pick up. It's well worded and easy to take in. I do have to go along with the others who posted on the appearance of the second guy on the cover. Looks like a photo you would find off of a book called ""Profiles of a serial killer"" Just my opinion of course ;)"
2,Not a VB.Net book,"This book is geared towards teaching beginning programming skills. It just so happens that the authors chose VB .Net as the language. In the outset they indicate that their intentions are to teach you programming skills, no matter what language you use. This made the book title misleading. I can usually depend on Wrox to produce a pretty good book. If I were a beginning programmer perhaps I would be impressed. If you want to really learn the ins and outs of VB.Net this is definitely not the book for you."
1,"THE PRINTER IS THE SYRINGE, THE INK IS HEROIN","I would hate to dis the seller/mfr of this product by mistake, as I have bought ink from a number of vendors here at Amazon. But I have to say, ALL of the cheap, and/or refurbished ink cartridges I have bought at Amazon have turned out to disappoint. If you can find the REAL, OEM ink for less, by all means buy it. I would never again buy anything but first run, new cartridges from the manufacturer.JUST KNOW THIS: WHEN YOU BUY A PRINTER, YOU ARE BUYING INTO THAT COMPANY'S INK LINE. IF THEIR INK APPEARS TO BE TOO EXPENSIVE, THEN THAT PRINTER IS TOO EXPENSIVE (EVEN IF THEY ARE GIVING IT AWAY).REMEMBER, THE PRINTER IS MERELY THE REUSABLE SYRINGE; THE INK IS THE HEROIN.Here are just a few of the bad things a cheap ink cartridge can do: clog, smear, fade, stain, splatter, corrode. IN MOST INSTANCES, IT WILL ALSO VOID YOUR WARRANTY."
5,It takes a lot of courage.....,"to reveal the story of your life and I think Trena Cole did a good job revealing hers. It had to be as hard to write this book as it was to read it. I like her style and guts. She was brutally honest about the cruel emotional abuse she and her brothers and sisters lived through. This isn't a book for the faint of heart, it's sad the way those kids were treated, but it does give the reader a lot of insight to the way some kids live every day. This woman is a true survivor of berating brainwashing in the worst way and I admire her for telling on the creeps who lorded over her while she was young. The book was a little choppy in spots and repetitive in others, but all and all I'm glad I read it. I would recommend it because I think it's important to expose how neglect and abuse make children feel, not only while they are being neglected and abused but forever."
4,An open look at life from the eyes of the abused,"Writing under a pseudonym, the author of ""Charred Souls"" takes the reader through her experiences growing up in an abusive family. It is not for the timid or those offended by foul language but the hurt and pain the author has endured is openly visible through the text. What makes this story somewhat different from most is that it is a case of recreational abuse, abuse that is done just for the pleasure of the abuser.The author takes us from her earliest childhood memories, through her childhood growth years, and on through high school to adulthood. At each stage she shares her thoughts and experiences as a child. This book will appeal to people who identify with the abused person and those who want to acquire a detailed knowledge of the potential of this type of abusive relationship. It is a detailed and heart wrenching tale."
2,Poorly written - Rambling memoir,"Not to say that this story isn't tragic. It is. The story itself isn't the issue that I had with the book. My issue stemmed mainly from the fact that it feels like a repetition of the same thoughts over and over and over. I felt like every sentence I read was nearly identical to the last.The book itself also contained numerous typos and grammatical errors. This might not be off-putting to some readers, and if not, please don't let this comment stop you.I have read several books about child abuse and its aftermath. If you are looking for a good read, I wouldn't strongly recommend this book."
4,Very good read..but had a few little minor scrapes,"This is a good book if you are studying child abuse, or familiar with it. I was looking into going back to school for social work and this book is really good at making you aware of what can happen out there to children. Trena tells a good story. Whoever edited it though, didn't do a good job. It can be repetivie , but that didn't bother me as much as the misspelled words (there were only a few)The author did a good job at telling the story and if you can overlook some of the spelling errors you've got yourself a pretty darn good book!!"
2,"Repetitive, Repetitive...Did I mention Repetitive?","Wow! While the author's honesty and pure heart-wrenching feelings were wonderfully portrayed, the book could have been shortened by 150 pages. Hearing the same information 2 or 3 times in the same paragraph was irritating to the point of putting the book down many times. It took me over a week to read 'cause I just couldn't deal with the inconsistencies of the ""flashbacks"" and the constant repetitiveness."
1,Disappointed,It probably could have been an interesting book but it was so poorly written I didn't even finish it.
2,poorly written,"I was excited to read this book, but am finding it very difficult to get through because it is written so poorly. The whole book is very repetitive which gets very annoying. A better editor or publisher would have done this book wonders."
3,"Not bad, but not memorable","The plot of the book was unique. The main character spends the story attempting to uncover the person responsible for a plot to destroy him. It's a much better story than the stereo-typical adventure plot.Although the plot and writing (and vocabulary!) are excellent, the characters are decidedly lacking. Their emotions and motives are not heavily explored and a few, such as the troll-man who serves as the main character's side-kick, end up feeling highly stereo-typical. Although the events in the story are satisfying, the lack of character development left me without any actual emotional attachment to what I read.This book is a pleasant enough distraction as a bedtime read, but not much more."
5,Mum has used this a LOT,"This book was a GREAT help to my Mom in her struggle. It detail's a very different kind of approach to quitting smoking. It doesn't throw crap down the reader's throat but rather allow a little leeway, understanding the difficult struggle ahead.Good strategies for anyone willing to listen to them.It is not a ""STOP SMOKING NOW!"" book, neither is it a self-help book, rather an informative, helpful little guide in breaking down each individual smoker's habit, helping them slowly, but surely, gain the willpower necessary to finally quit smoke.Since she finally quit, It's been several Month's. Her mood has changed a lot, she seem's happier, less nervous and easier to accept difficult challenges."
2,Major disappointment,"I know a lot of folks are praising this record, but I beg to differ. I don't know what happened. This is almost easy listening compared even to the ""lightest"" of their previous CDs. The songs are quite boring for the most part, the only highlights being ""Eagleheart"" and moments of ""Fantasia"" and the instrumental ""Stratofortress"" (albeit Tolkki is still an amazing guitarist). Perhaps a solo career is best for the members from now on? They still have some killer music see ""Episode"", ""Visions"" and ""Infinite"" but this is lacking... if this album is any inclination then they must step aside and concede the throne to the True Metallers Rhapsody, Kamelot and Lost Horizon."
3,hmm....,"I'm a finn and usually praise people of my home country, but this time, I found Stratovarius boring. YES...I know...but after track six, I could not listen to more. It is musically up to par. I mean if you take harmonic meaning and arangement talent in to count. But this album just doesn't keep me interested long enough to go through it in one go."
4,Great Job....but not at their best,Stratovarius showed an evolution into this Cd. Sounds like Angra and takes orchestral pieces mixed with their characteristic raw power metal. A fantastic album....but Elements Part 2 could be even better.
2,The Stratovarius Disease....,"This band has sooo much potential, but they can't EVER pull it together.What am I trying to say? Well, Stratovarius makes 1 or 2 masterpieces on each album and every other song is a throw-out. This album is no different, there's Eagleheart and A Drop In The Ocean, melodic and catchy as hell. The rest are....boring.Other examples include:Infinite - Hunting High and Low, A Million Light Years AwayFourth Dimension - Against The Wind, Distant SkiesOther than the two great songs per album, it's just the same ol stuff over and over. Tolkki just does a fast guitar riff, terrible double bass pounding and Timo's lead vocal is just doing the same ol stuff on every fast strato song.C'mon Strato, pull it together and give us a whole album."
5,Hail Stratovarius!,"These guys are great! I can't believe how many good albums they have. I have to say that when I heard this album, I was not dissapointed. Stratovarius is one of the best metal bands I ever heard. Not only is the guitarist very good, the rest of it is as well. They know how to make really good epic power metal. Every song on this album is very good. I especially like the songs ""Eagle Heart"" and ""Learning To Fly"". It's too bad that the U.S. doesn't have bands out there like this. If we did, half the world wouldn't be laughing at us for our poor music taste. But for those who do choose to give good music a chance, I say buy this album, along with ""Infinite"" their best album so far."
2,They can do it better,"Kotipelto signs great as usual, but...the record is way too artistic. There's too much choral singing and too little brutal force and uncontrolled passion from their early days. For new listeners: buy some old record like Visions or Infinite."
2,One less fan...,"I have been listening to Stratovarius's previous releases for about a year now and I must say, they have lost me as a fan! Talent and musically speaking, they're one of the best power metal bands in existence, but lyrically they're lacking! Ones philisophical and religious beliefs is his/her own choice. In the future I would recommend keeping their own views on Christ and God out of their music, and move forward with other lyrical content. There are many more subjects to write lyrics about other than what God hasn't done for me. What have your done for God?"
2,yaaaawwwwwnnnnnn,"This is pretty much the biggest load of overrated crap i've heard I'm used to over the top bands like Rhapsody, Sonata Arctica, and Nightwish those are all good bands with solid songs but this. When I first put this in and heard Eagleheart, fast catchy REPITITOUS but over all not bad from there on borriinnngggg same uninspired licks vocals I can hope Elements Pt2 Is better than this snooze fest which saddens me because there OLDER stuff is acually pretty good"
3,Good but more detail,"I am an eight year old and I just finished reading this book. I give it 3 stars because I liked the part where the family saved up their money to buy a chair. I also liked how they added the details about the chair like that it was soft and big. This story could be improved because I wanted a bit more detail about the fire. I wanted to know how people were feeling like if they were ""yelping and screaming."" I also wanted to know how the fire started because it would be a bit more interesting."
4,wonderful story,"I really loved this book. It tells a sweet story about how a family is supported by friends and family after they lose their house to a fire. It also shows how the family works together to save up for a chair so the mother, who works as a waitress to support them, can have a comfortable place to sit.I give it 4 stars only because my son did not care for it. I can only assume it is because none of the characters were boys and, it's really not a ""boy"" story, I suppose. He may also have had a difficult time relating to the whole idea of single parenthood. This is a rather foreign thing to him."
1,Another missing Dad,"Where's the father in this story? With all the unfortunate divorcing going on in this world, I plan to inundate my child with stories about happy families with both a mom and a dad. If it doesn't work out for him when he grows up and gets married, at least I can say I tried my best. I'm tired of forcing the feminist agenda on our kids. They need to know that not having a GOOD husband/father at home is not a good thing. Also, I thought the book was boring and the chair was ugly."
4,Reaching one's goals.,"This is a small children's book about a little girl and her waitress mother who are saving change in a jar to buy a new chair for their apartment. The book was a 1983 Caldecott Honor book (i.e., a runner-up to the Medal winner) for best illustrations in a book for children. It shows the joy of attaining one's goals after continued effort."
5,All_time Favorite Book,"I first read Outlaw Red and as yong girl about 30 years ago. I still go back and read it from time to time. The story is clean, honest, and it takes the reader right to the setting of the Wintapi in Canada. I love all three of Kjelgaard's books for that reason. Kjelgaard masterfully used imagery to keep his readers' interest This however, is my favorite. Sean, the pampered showdog, is haphazardly thrown into the wilderness. Through cunning and instinct the dog manages to survive the perils of his situation.Sean's courage in adversity makes this book a perfect read for anyone of any age."
3,Not this author's best,"Personally, I can only read so many stories about Irish Setters that exceed all realistic performance expectations, and this book somehow cheapens its predecessors.By putting Sean on the same pedestal that Big Red himself already occupies, Kjelgaard does a disservice to Big Red.That being said, this is still a pretty strong book. I enjoy Kjelgaard more when he tackles other breeds (such as Snow Dog, Lion Hound, and Desert Dog), but there's no question that he brought all of his considerable writing skills to this exciting novel.Fans of Kjelgaard know to expect taciturn human characters with hearts of gold, exciting encounters with local wildlife, and vivid descriptions of the natural setting. They will not be disappointed here. While the plot is pretty predictable, I think most readers will enjoy the journey.An established Kjelgaard fan will certainly want to read this book, but if you're trying this author for the first time, start with Big Red or Snow Dog."
5,over -all a wonderful book!,"Set in the Wintapi a gorgeous setter,sean, has captured the heart of a young man. dumped into the wilderness, pampered sean must survive on his own with a ruthless coyote on his trail. If sean survives can the boy who loves him keep him for himself?"
2,They fall down,I purchased these for my 6 year old to use in hip-hop class. They are too big for him and fall down constantly. I wouldn't recommend them for small children.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"This book is a huge scam. It gives worthless testimonials that tell you nothing about how to buy and sell Penny Stocks. Additionally, it is potentially the worst written book I have ever read. Riddled with typographical errors it appears to me an opportunity to fill up pages so that the author can make money rather than offering any real decent product. Additionally, it seems that the majority of the other reviews of this book were written either by the author of this book or by one of his close friends because they are nowhere near the truth. If you buy this book, do not say you weren't warned."
3,Not what I expected,"I rate this DVD as 3 stars, because I really got dissapointed with it. The main weekness of this production is Jago, what a bad choice by Karajan. I mean, Glosop's voice is too soft for Jago. He never sounds convincing. Vickers Otello is pretty good but not as impressive as Del Monaco's. Mirella Freni is superb Desdemona, maybe the best I've ever heard. This is her role. Karajan's conduction sometimes is little bit strange. I do not agree on some tempos. I think that Drinking scene (""Roderigo, beviam"") from the first act could be played little bit faster. It is so slow that it looses all the beauty and horror of Jago's character. Also in the second act, in Jago's and Otello's duet some part of it could be played faster.In total, one should see this production once. As far as I am concerned, I am not going to watch it second time. Why should I? I have Del Monaco's and Gobbi's unforgatable recording."
3,"Great performance, frustrating audio","I purchased this performance in its laser disc format a number of years ago and got rid of it because the audio portion is made of extremes. If I raise the volume to hear the quiet portions, I'm blasted out of the room when the music gets louder. There's no happy medium. I don't know if this is Von Karajan's doing or the fault of the sound engineers. I thought that the DVD would be better in this respect, but it's not. So if you're interested in this version, be aware of this (for me) shortcoming. I can listen to it either through earphones (risking my hearing) or when my neighbors aren't at home."
5,Outstanding Hot!,"The flavor is outstanding for that great hot sauce taste on any tacos, beef, eggs at breakfast, you name it. Enjoy!"
5,Great Gift! Very Happy,This was given as a gift and the recipient was beyond happy and excited about this CD! Great Buy!
3,"Good music, not so good CD",The CD contains a stereo set and a mono set with all the same music in both sets. The Getz and Johnson are wonderful but the CD is repetitious.
2,"Misses the Big Picture, Concentrates on the Details","""Understanding the French Revolution"" assumed that the reader already knew all about the French Revolution.Names and events were introduced without explanations; competing factions were referred to but not defined until many chapters later. Idiosyncrasies, such as calendar revisions, were not explained. For the novice like me, it meant piecing things together and hoping I got most of the pieces.The revolution was led by financial, mercantile, and manufacturing enterprises that wanted power commensurate with their wealth. This book mentions the ""leading role"" of the ""big bourgeoisie;"" however, it was entirely devoted to conflicts between various factions of the petty bourgeoisie.This book does present most of the relevant facts about the revolution, but the book is poorly organized and lacks a unifying theme. It is not easy reading."
4,A Much Needed History Lesson,"Given the Republican Party's recent reaction to the Trent Lott affair, this book is an excellent retelling of the rise of the GOP in the South and its sordid dabbling in racial politics. Earl and Merle Black are two of the most thoughtful and fair observers of Southern politics, and this is some of their best work yet. Occasionally dry and overly laden with charts, the book can drag in places."
5,The Rise of the Southern Republicans,"Merle and Earl Black have written an easy-to-read book about the rise of the Republican Party in the South after the Democrats, who had championed white rule, began to take the lead in ensuring that blacks had access to education, transportation, housing, dining, voter registration, voting, and all the other things to which they had been denied access, or equal access, because of their race. Progress did not come easy, nor did it come without pain and even bloodshed. It took many little baby steps over many years. The struggle continues to this day. At every step, as progress was made, the Republican Party grew stronger, the Democratic Party weaker. Merle and Earl Black chronicle this story and provide their own insights, references to and quotes from other sources, and an abundance of charts, statistics, and other data to support their conclusions."
3,Far longer than necessary,"All right, if you REALLY REALLY want to know about every southern US Senator or House member from the 1950s or so until today, this is THE book for you. To be honest, I think the Black brothers could have covered the important stuff in about 50-100 pages; instead, they walk you through just about every southern election. They should have developed a few instructive case studies rather than covered everything. But then, if I were so smart, I could have written my own southern politics book.Anyhoo, the changing political dynamics of the South are incredibly important for understanding the future of our nation. People are going to continue to move down here (I live in Columbia, SC), so the region is only going to become more important over the coming years in presidential elections and national politics. The Blacks' theory on why the South went from strong Democrat to Republican is interesting, but you can easily get the basics from the first and last chapter or so."
3,Dust Bowl novel,"Set in South Dakota during the Dust Bowl, a drifter (Maury Grant) stops at the Thor ranch on his way west. Things are very rough there during these Depression years, but unlike the Joads in Steinbeck's GRAPES OF WRATH (which it is often compared to), the Thors stay put and don't light out for greener pastures in California. Grant stays for a while with the Thors, then leaves. But he's drawn back finally, more mature for his experiences. Mansfield's style is deliberately very crude in language and character depiction: for some reason he portrays Grant as an insensitive tough. Other than this major stylistic flaw, Manfred is good at capturing the nobility of these exhausted but not defeated people."
2,Disappointing,I am a big fan of Gary Burton and I had high expectations for this cd. It did not live up to them. I wouldn't rush to buy it when there are dozens of other cds by Gary Burton you could purchase.
2,Tach function not so hot,"This is a good product, it didn't work for my application. I wanted to use it to check the rpm on my 4 cyl outboard boat motor. The boat motor has a tach output that goes to an analog meter. When hooking up this digital tach meter the readings are all over the place."
2,Not as complete as I expected,"I haven't been impressed at all by this book. We are building a web site that will eventually use 11 languages so we have kind of a high interest and knowledge on the subject ;-).We found that the book was rather imcomplete it doesn't talk about how codesets are handled in forms. It also contained some ""errors"" such as suggesting the use of a flag to represent the various language (this is definitelly not politically correct!).But I guess for $20 you still get a few good tips."
4,Overpriced but looks nice,"Kinda retro looking on my ddesk. Goes well with the matching tape dispenser. Am I really reviewing this? Anyway, it's a post it dispenser that cost me $20. What can I say."
2,Wrong COLOR!,"The picture is misleading, I received this product in the WHITE color. I was hoping to get it in black as shown, but that wasn't the case. I didn't bother to return it because of the whole hassle behind returns. However, now I have a white Post-It Note dispenser mismatching my desk!"
2,Used product sold as new,I have this item at work. I know what a new package looks like. This package came with torn cellophane covering. The post it notes had been used and there was not a full refill. i hate paying for new things and getting used items. I will not buy from this shipper again.
4,All in all a good story,"I enjoyed this story, however, I did not like the way all the male characters in the book wanted to either rape her or take advantage of her in some way. The story itself was very compelling and it had a lot of heartache and love in it. I just didn't like the way the men were always wanting to get under her skirts."
3,"Good Information, but Boring","Not a bad book, but covers this glamorous and supposedly fun business in a boring tone. I recommend this book for some overall guidance, but highly recommend a companion book to fill in the gaps."
4,Comprehensive and insightful,"This is a clearly written easy to understand overview of the topic.The author cites numerous persons in the industry, giving the reader the feeling that they are in touch with current agents/operators in the field. The recommended additional resources appendix is also useful."
3,"good for broadcast, bad for web video","Final Cut Pro is a good editor, but it suffers from one fatal flaw which is that the Quicktime movies it exports don't look anything like what you see when editing. The Editor is designed to show you what the movie would look like on a TV screen, but if you're producing for the web then you have no idea what the final output will look like until you do it. The results are always washed out and low contrast. There's no way to tell Final Cut that you're working on a web video, so don't screw with the colors - just show me what it will look like on a computer screen, not a TV."
5,Delightful and delicate pianism,"I bought this set along with the Beethoven Piano Concertos which Barenboim presented with his Staatskapelle Berlin. I found that set to be very satisfying musically. It was wonderful to watch a master pianist at work and directing his orchestras from the keyboard. The Steinway and Sons piano delivered a clean and clear sound and with Barenboim's playing, it was great.Coming to the Liszt recital, it was totally worlds apart. Delicate and subtle playing conveyed with the right amount of warmth was apparent. Bareboim was like a kid in love with the music and the ending of each piece was met with approval from the audience. You could almost hear a pin drop. That was the level of attentiveness given by the audience in La Scala's venerable opera house which Barenboim is set to take on the Principal Guest Conductor's position."
1,For the collector's shelf....,"This slender volume (65 pages) contains two memoirs of H. P. Lovecraft, ""The Gentleman from Angell Street,"" by M. E. Eddy, and ""Walks with Lovecraft,"" by C. M. Eddy, Jr. Both of these items, along with dozens more reminiscences from Lovecraft's friends, were reprinted in the recent omnibus volume LOVECRAFT REMEMBERED, so what else do you get?Well, you get a few well-reproduced snapshots. And you get several ""poems"" by Mrs. Eddy, about which the less said the better. And you get a brief note by Mrs. Eddy's daughter, Ruth.Unless this description makes you want it, I don't think you need it!"
4,upper or lower spring adjustment,"Gr8 Product Will recommend to any buyer, had this installed on my Nissan Skyline to add a little height to the back, very impressed with it, easy to install and you can adjust height to suit your taste, just jack up your vehicle install."
4,neato,These really add to the idogs appearence a lotVery cuteI was worried that they'd cover some of the sensors and hurt the preformance of the idog but it wasn't an issue
1,very poorly constructed/not flattering,"I love fishnet and thought this looked so cute. However I was very disappointed when I received it.For one, it was put together very poorly. The thong especially was just a piece of cheap junk.And for another it was VERY unflattering. The bra offers no lift at all, and it just looked horrible when I tried it on."
2,It's just ok,"I received it and tried it on. You definately get what you pay for. The bottom seems to be fine. The top however is very very unflattering. It doesnt look anything like it does in the picture. It's just a shelf bra. I personally am a D cup and dont require any lift in that area but it is still very unflattering and awkward fitting. Since it's so cheap, it would be nice to use the bottom portion but find another bra top."
2,Ok at best,On the bottom its ok. Its very cheap but you get what you pay for. The bra is an absolute disaster. It doesn't really fit me and is totally unflattering to my chest. It isn't anything at all like the picture. Overall its fine as long as you wear another bra with it. I'll just spend a little extra money from now on and get better quality merchandise though.
4,"Technique great, patterns repetitive","I have to say that I was a little bit disappointed of the patterns. Nothing new, nothing exciting. Sure, the pattern seem to be ""authentic"", but I can find them in other books as well.But the ""how to"" area is very well written and helpful even for an intermediate or advanced knitter."
5,A thinking knitter's joy,"The ideas that take shape in these patterns and garments are inspired and in turn will inspire all knitters who understand the beauty of these ""knitterly"" designs. This book could provoke an even greater renaissance of thinking knitters. These knitting patterns flow perfectly with the rhythm of the art. Nothing is slapped on for show. Take a look at the Phoenix sweater. Incredible!"
2,I just wish...,"I just wish they had released the Memphis DVD 1983 concert separetely from this box set, instead of using it as a bait. I have all their albums, there's no need for another compilation for me. But the Memphis show is another history. It's their best documented live action ever. Well, maybe I'll burn it from someone who bought the whole box."
1,Judas Who??,"This set would be overpriced if it was offered for free. Priest was always a one dimensional band and this set collects all their atrocities.Please people avoid, there is alot better music for you all out there to enjoy."
2,A ridiculous waste of money,"The potential of box sets to draw in a naive fan to buying unnecessary compilations like this is a serious threat. There are hardly any bsides or bonus tracks like those on the reissues, and material from Sad Wings of Destiny is scarce and nearly nonexistent (you would think that with all the money Priest could just buy out Gull records by now). Packaging like this is cynical and manipulative, and if you're already a hardcore fan, unneccesary obviously. The Iron Maiden box set was at least unreleased live material (however repetitious much of it was as far as track listings), and the only draw of this one is the SFV tour live dvd, which was previously available only bootleg. Skip this unless you have the money AND are a newcomer."
2,This is not honest!!!!,"Well, this is not a honest act by Judas Priest! (or their record company). The fans (like myself) already own all this tracks in one way or another. Maybe it's a nice box for a new fan trying to get to know this band properly.The trick is that, as a bait, they put, as DVD, the show that all Priest fans are looking for to be released in DVD for a long time: Memphis 1982, during the Screaming For Vengeance Tour!! Yes, that's it! This marvellous show can only be officially obtained, until now, by spending the priced US$ 54 of this box!In Electric Eye, they put the awful show from the Turbo tour, when the band seemed Motley Crue or Ratt, a sell out hair-metal act! I hoped the Memphis show would be released as a solo product some time after Electric Eye. How naive I was..."
2,What is this that you want me to buy?,"OK, first off. I am a fan of JP, but this set just really sucks. I have all these songs on CD. A box set is to be the very best of your work and some unreleased things, such as live, demo, one offs, goof ups, there is nothing of the such here except for Heart of the Lion, which you can hear on Rob's live CD. Coming off of the Ripper years, they put some of the worst songs for him on here, maybe cause Glenn and KK didn't write a very good sophmore album to follow up Jugulator.I didn't buy this for the DVD or cause it came in a nice metal box. I bought it for my collection. I have yet to open this. I have no interest in opening this."
5,More Priest than you can shake a stick at,"This box set arrived on time, in great condition, and is a box set most collectors would want. It's packaged with metal studding around the box for novelty, and the CD's cover all the great tunes you'd want to hear, as well as a few hard to find songs. There is a bonus DVD included which is cool. If you love Priest, this is a must have."
5,"This isn't crap, this is awesome.","Judas Priest are one of the greatest metal bands of all time. The music in this box set spans a career of countless 5 star metal tracks. I understand that some people may find the very early Priest material a little dated, but you have to place yourself into the time zone and the generations Priest were playing to. Priest put a lot of work into their songs and still play a lot of their classic tracks - Sinner, Victim of changes, Ripper etc etc live even today. If you wanna listen to a metal band ahead of it's time, you gotta listen to 'Unleashed in the East'. This is by far one of the greatest live albums by a metal band ever. So to say this is crap, shows a real misunderstanding of the genre."
5,AWESOME!!!,BEST GIFT EVER FOR ANY MOM. THE NATURAL FRAGRANCES ARE SO BABY DELICIOUS YOU'LL WANT TO HAVE ANOTHER! CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT THESE NATURAL BABY PRODUCTS. BONNIE- MOM OF THREE LITTLE SPROUTS
3,Smelled great but left my hands greasy~!,"I thought the scrumptious baby cream smelled heavenly and though I found it greasy upon application, it left my hands feeling soft and pliant, and the greasy feeling left eventually! I am very picky in my hand lotions, I don't like it cloying my skin, making it feel like it cannot breath, this product didn't make me feel like this! Everyone who tried it agrees that the smell and feel of the cream was something they enjoyed and would use again! Watch how you squeeze it out, it comes out rather fast and thick."
1,Too thick,This baby lotion is too thick and absolutely does not smell fresh or clean. Smells like something you would find at a parfume counter in a department store. Definitely not for my baby!
1,"Damn, it's the badest book I ever had to read!",It's not neccesary to read that book - or maybe I'm to stupid to do :-
5,I love these Knee supports,I ordered two Knee supports for my left and right knee and the package came exactly when they said it will. I used my fathers Knee sleeves that were exactly like these and I was expected the exact same product. But I was given the updated models that just had a different McDavid emblem and colors on the inside. I am very pleased and will order through them when I need another product. Thank you McDavid.
5,Works fine,"Purchased for my mom, she noticed instant improvement. I don't know what her issue was, only that her knee was in terrible pain. It fixed that and know she's able to move around a lot better."
2,Not great for knee support for working men,"Bought this brace for my husband because the one the doctor gave him was wearing out. When the brace arrived, there is an insert stating that the brace cannot be worn more than 1-2 hours due to the type of material. My husband needs support all day at work. We returned the brace but the seller would not refund shipping and we had to payt he return shipment as well. Bought one at Walmart instead that is working great and cost less. Next time we will just go to the store!"
1,McDavid has sizing problems,"I ordered this first in XL, the size that should fit me according to McDavid. It was too small for me to pull it up over my knee. So I ordered it in XXL, the next larger size. This one is sloppy loose, and has to be bunched up under the straps in order to stay on at all. So what is a customer to do? Two return charges now, and no size that actually fits. This is a brand name that I will avoid."
5,A great read,"The Nephilim Seed had me in suspense. I recommend it to Christians looking for engaging reading without the typical and undesireable themes and issues so often found in today's fiction. You should check out his other books - especially ""Final Witness"" and ""Blind Justice."""
1,Disappointed in product,"We have played with an old spinners game for quite a while, and wanted a newer one that allowed more people to play. Our old spinners game has brightly colored times from bright pint, purple, green, turquoise, yellow, orange etc. My in-laws purchased us this game to add on, we have a large family. These tiles make it look like we are playing for the dead, all of the colors are dark from black, grey, dark burgundy, navy blue. My husband is color blind and can not play with these tiles. I wanted to return the set and order one of the older versions from the ""Used"" catagory, but, they do not seem to be available anymore. I can not trust this site to properly represent the product I am looking for."
2,"Putting a new ""Spin"" on Domino's","This is a great new game with one exception....the colors on the dots are too close in color and are all dark in value. We prefer brighter dots so it is easier to recognize. After playing with brighter numbers in other sets, it is very frustrating to use this set. The spinner game is fun and a new twist to the regular domino's. It just needs brighter colors!!"
4,Sharing the fun,Everyone who has played this game with us has wanted to know how to get one. This is the 4th purchase as a gift. It has become a favorite of family & friends.
5,"Spinners, a great group game","Spinners is a great game for a group. It is better than Mexican Train dominoes because you need less room on the table to play it and you can rotate people among tables as you are playing. Older kids and adults will enjoy it. Participants can carry on a conversation and play at the same time so it makes for a great mingling tool. While it is not too intense for conversation, it does encourage thought and strategy while playing--a winning combination!"
4,"Great product, quick service, excessive shipping cost","We live in Alaska and really wanted two of these games to pass on to our married daughters since it has been a holiday tradition to play. We found them for purchase on Amazon but were displeased at the cost to ship to Alaska. Although we are part of the US and USPS ships for a reasonable price, we weren't given that option and paid at least double what it could have been. UPS and FedEx rip off those of us in Alaska while USPS treats us just like everybody in the Lower-48. Give us a USPS option!"
5,Enjoyable,"Have played this game for years and finally have our own set. Compared to older versions this one is lacking in being able to see the distinction with the different colors, the colors should be more vibrant. The score card is TO SMALL! Need more room for calculation of the score. So we will continue a score sheet that we created. Overall, a fun way to spend time with family and friends."
5,The Game of Spinner,The game of Spinner is a great for adults. We have game day once a week and play Spinner every other week.KME
5,Family Fun,I purchased this after playing at a friends house. It is the type of game that all ages can enjoy. We play wtih our grandchildren whose ages range from 7 to 15. All of us enjoy playing and it is very easy to put away. It comes in a nice storage box and the score pad is included. I highly reccomend this game.
5,So much FUN!,I played the travel version this fall with friends & I knew I just had to order one! It is so much FUN!!! And my 9 year old grand daughter loved playing it also. Great game!!
5,SPINNER is a hit!,"Spinner is a fast, easy, and fun domino game. As we introduce it to friends, many have asked where to get it. We point them to Amazon as a source, as well as Camping World. We have now purchased a total of 5 of these games and have given them as gifts!"
4,Spinner: fun for the whole family,"This game has nice, solid dominoes made like ""in the olden days"", (pseudo ivory-like), and comes in a square metal box for easy storage.At different times we played this game with children from 5 to 17 and adults, as well. Everyone had fun and the youngest, who is just learning numbers, needed to count the dots, but soon learned the design that represented each number and was able to enjoy the game and keep up with everyone.The rules can be simple (which we played) or more complex, as there are directions for several versions. I believe the game is well made and fun for groups of children & adults of varioius ages and abilities. I saw a version with numbers rather than the ""dots"", but we chose the right one for us.The game also includes a score pad, which wasn't noted, and I purchased another that isn't needed (yet). A great, simple to learn game that we all enjoy, and is educational as well."
4,Easy to Pick Up; Hard to put down,"I can count on one hand the titles of the books I have been unable to put down, and this is one of them. I went in search of more when I read Sean Patrick's column in Catholic Digest and found short, but full, chapters in the life of a true boy - basically faithful to his religous upbringing, but full of mischevious adventures. It reminds me of Roald Dahl's book, ""Boy"" - another I couldn't put down."
5,Heartwarming nostalgic stories.,This book is a treasury of wonderful stories that will make you laugh and cry and wish that you had known this family personally. I am only sorry that I finished the book so quickly. I hope that Mr. Patrick will soon be compiling another book from his Catholic Digest columns. READ IT!
4,Wonderfully nostalgic and highly recommended.,"Sean Patrick writes of the trials and triumphs of being part of a large, poor family. I found this book very uplifting and true to what it means to be part of a family and community who care for each other. Anyone who grew up in the 40s and 50s will understand the spirit of those times. I laughed and cried through most of his stories. Written in a very loving, humorous manner."
5,Duke Dejan(RIP)You're Still 'The Piran'(Dat's Godfather in Creole).,"Duke Dejan is one of many special musicians,I never heard of before I picked up this excellent Preservation Hall cd,inspired by the then 88 year-old singer/saxophonist and former leader of New Orleans' Olympia Brass Band.In this cd,his character comes through in his Creole-accented English; in the liner notes to the cd,most of us will pick up a new word,""piran"" or Godfather,which is how Dejan referred to himself to bass player Benjamin Jaffe,whose family runs Preservation Hall.The cd which kicks off with 'Corinna,Corinna' includes some beautiful soloing(I'm partial to trumpeter Wendell Brunious.But this one's for Duke Dejan;RIP.It's his heart."
5,A Welcome Edition To New Orleans Music,"This album is a treasure. Laid back and joyous, the group sounds like they're playing in your living room. A fitting nod to the late Duke Dejan, founder of The Olympia Brass Band, who handles some of the vocals. The group shines, especially Wendell Brunious on Trumpet. Highlights are Duke Dejan's 'Basin Street Blues' and guitarist Don Vappie's vocal on 'Wrap Your Troubles In Dreams.' Just trumpet, bass, guitar, piano, with the members alternating on vocals. This is a most welcome edition to anyone interested in the New Orleans traditional style."
4,hot 4,"this recording has the root feeling. Just litlle of playinng, enough singing but it works. Perfect atmosphere and all things in the right place. An icon singing his last recording, so great artist."
3,"Meh, it's OK","Continues the story of Lerris in Modesitt's usual formulaic style. Not bad, but also not extraordinary."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"In this particular world, Chaos and Order are supposed to balance. If there is too large a concentration of one sort of power, either some of it will be waxed, or there will be a rise in the corresponding side.This makes ultra-powerful Lerris and Justen the Grey running around in exile-land a bit odd. Perhaps that is part of the point.Don't forget the habits of good woodworkers, either!"
2,"The Death of Chaos - mini-me ""Library Binding""","It would be NICE if Amazon would make it clear that the ""Library Binding"" and ""Hardcover Binding"" are NOT EQUIVALENT IN SIZE! The ""Library Binding"" is nothing more than the mass market paperback binding with a hard cover.I was very disappointed."
4,Going my way...........,"If you are... be sure to pack plenty of clean drawers because with hot girls like these you're bound to have an accident. But hopefully not until you've experienced all that is ""spring break""..... interactively speaking of course. That's right folks, you can take a road trip, have complete control over the wheel (remote control), while a couple of babes ride shotgun, and still make it in time for dinner made by the Mrs.... Totally worth buckling up for!!!"
5,Great book! Definitely worth reading,"I really liked this book. Mr. Morris is very capable of writing books that capture your attention, and yet he weaves a remarkable tale of God's love into his stories. This is by far one of my favorite series. I literally couldn't put this book down. Cheney is like a lot of women I know (me included)."
4,the proof that lynn & gilbert morris are great authers,"This if one of my favorit books! I love the way the authers use details and facts. The story captures you, you'r filled with cheneys emotions and you can feel what she is feeling. This book is truley an insperation. I love this hole series, each book is even better than the last."
5,My Favorite Christian Book Series,"It's been years since I have read this series, but I'm about to pick it up again. I read all the books several times through when I was younger. Gilbert Morris has always been known for his fantastic historical fiction, but the characters can be a bit formulaic. I feel Lynn brings a wonderful realness to Cheney and Shiloh on top of the expected historic detail. There are plot twists, realistic character development and beautiful descriptions of the settings. I can't think of a Christian book series I love more than Cheney Duvall, M.D. I highly recommend it. This is the first in the series, so I'd recommend starting here. :-)"
4,The Stars For a Light,"This is the first book in a great series by Gilbert and Lynn Morris. If you love history, adventure, humor and romance this series is for you. If you like Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman then you'll love this series about Dr. Cheney Duvall and her faithful nurse Shiloh Irons."
5,Two HaLLoweEns!,"My son wore this for the last two Halloween seasons and I would say it has had at least 20 seperate wearings. It has held up great. And this last year it was pretty tight on his long body but we wore it anyway! The trick on the head piece is to wad up stuffing, we used paper towels, and puff up the top so that the teeth don't slide down and cover your child eyes. Once we added the stuffing it was top notch, otherwise my son kept trying to push it up. Nice thing about it is you layer under it or wear less. Since we attended trunk or treats, and carnivals, and then trick or treating we did not always need the warmth. And this year we moved to Texas so I was glad for a thin costume!"
1,"Cheap, Cheap, Cheap","Very poorly constructed costume. The pattern looks pixelated when you get close. I would not recommend this to even be used as rags for cleaning up oil, totally garbage."
3,Dino Costume fabric is very thin,"I had thought the costume would be more durable than it is. However, it was a hit with the 3 year old grandson."
3,"Thin material, size runs small- but fun for dress up time!","This is a great costume for over the clothes dress up time. The material is thinner than I had expected, and the size is a little snug for a 4T. It's not really meant to wear outside for night time trick or treating because the hood can come down and block child's vision. Also, the costume is dark and non reflective. I love the costume for dress up and imaginative play time and each one of my kids has a different dinosaur that they pretend to be and read about."
3,GM Application,"I have increased the ride height of several 60's 70's era GM A and B bodies with a target height of 1"" over stock. I typically used longer free length springs, where available, and where not, fabricated a standoff spacer. I tried these spacers recognizing that the ease of installation (compared to removing the springs) might be a reasonable trade off in ride harshness since one active turn is lost. They were reasonably easy to install but only increased ride height on the front by 3/8"" and no measureable increase on the rear. The vehicle was a '61 Impala convertible. The item quality was good but with OE coil spacing of 3/4"" or so, they don't add much."
1,Crap,I used these on my offroad rig for a little extra capacity for a moose hunt and they didn't even finish the hunt. Garbage on a fullsize.
2,The thing wont stay together!,"I try and try to use this, but the handle keeps coming apart. I will have to glue it in order to use it."
2,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY READ THE REVIEWS,"I unpackaged it all put it together (really easy),.. threw out the box and waited to use it. When I finally used it it barely picked up anything. I really had to keep going over the same crumbs and dust bunnies to get it to sweep it. I think that the bristles don't reach the floor enough to do the job. I was really disappointed in this product but for what it would cost to return it it wasn't worth it. I also might add that if you have a really thick carpet it might work better for you, I was looking primarily for a bare tile, floor item that would pick up crumbs etc. However a sweeper is a sweeper and it should to the same job that a broom would do. My Grandmother had one many years ago and it was like magic! This one is cheaply made also. Hope that this helps."
5,easy,"easy to put together and a great picker upper for cat hair. light weight sturdy, I highly recommend is product"
4,Good Sweeper,I use this in my cubical because the janitors only come through about once a month to vaccum and clean so in the meantime I like a cleaner environment. I can see how people may have problems with the handle coming apart but oh well. I'd buy this again.
5,Works as Advertised,"The sweeper works great! Perfect for a dorm, small apartment, office, etcWorks great, picks up lots of dust and debris. I fell in love with this thing the second I got it. So easy to use and keeps the floor clean. It's incredibly easy to empty the dust pans and not make a complete mess, and comes with a comb for the cleaning brush. I USE THIS ALMOST DAILY!The handle does have some issues but if you hit it on the ground when assembling it you shouldn't have the problem (the instructions tell you to do this). It also has problems getting around corners or up against the wall, but that is expected."
3,Bissell 2201-2 Swift Sweeper Sweeper,[[ASIN:B0001WW2G2 Bissell 2201-2 Swift Sweep Sweeper]As everyone else has said the handle is a PITA and I wound up taping it.I bought this product to get pet hair off a specific rug so I wouldn't have to drag out the big vacuum every day. For cleaning up pet hair this product works well.
2,Useless Product,"I saw many good reviews from the other buyers before ordering it, but I was so disappointed. As I held it in my hand to try it for the first time, it was noisy and inflexible for operation--it was just like a funny toy for kids. The performance was no better than a regular broom that can really clean every corner. I returned it the next day!"
3,Sweeper,This particular sweeper is adequate for the price. The only frustrating part is that the handle keeps falling off. It needs to be glued on.
3,Paid To Much,I'm not satisfied with this product at all. It doesn't pickup as advertised and the thing keeps coming apart. Very disapointed.
3,good;not great,"Works well on low pile carpet/rugs, not so good on tile floors. I was hoping it would pick up bird seed from the tile floor in the room in which my parakeet resides. It doesn't."
4,sweeper,Just the ticket for doing quick cleanups of cat fur and orher pesky problems. It works like a dream and no electricity required
4,Better than electric sweeper!,"Picks up things just as good as the Bissell electric sweeper...lasts LONGER than it too. I had an electric one and it didn't even last me more than a couple months.PROS:Easy to empty outLightweightSweeps up dust, pet hair, and crumbs in just one sweepCONS:While sweeping, if you bump the sweeper into something hard, it tends to spit out what it just swept up. Doesn't happen often."
4,Nice Little Sweeper For The Money.,"Even though it doesn't pick up everything I'd like, it does a fairly decent job on carpets which is what I bought it for. It's nice and compact which is also what I wanted. The handle problem, (coming apart), that folks complain about is, in my opinion, easily remedied and not an issue."
1,Fatal flaw,"Don't buy this. It does pick up bitsies well. But it has one limitation and one fatal flaw that landed it in the garbage. The limitation is that it is ineffective along edges. The fatal flaw is that the three-piece pole falls into three pieces as you use it, after just a few strokes. I spent more time picking up the pole pieces and reassembling than I spent cleaning. And taping it only works temporarily. Didn't the manufacturer test this at all?!?!? To replace this darn thing, I bought the Dirt Devil SD20000RED Versa Power All-in-One Stick Vacuum Cleaner for $20 on Amazon. It is so much better for essentially the same money!"
4,Good Bang For Buck,"What's to say? This is a cheap carpet sweeper, and it works great! The main sweeper unit is well constructed of metal and it's very sturdy indeed. However, the handle is a 4-piece tubular thingee that is marginal at best. The handle is in 4 sections so it can be shipped in a smaller box. The sweeper works perfectly on my office carpet, and I stow it away in a small file cabinet. I recommend this sweeper for occasional use, but I would suggest fabricating a solid piece of tubing for a better handle if you intend to use this for more frequent sweeping. Otherwise, the 4-piece handle will keep falling apart in your hands."
4,Pretty good.,"Although this is a little less sturdy than I expected, and a bit small, it works pretty well for picking up stuff on the carpet. I personally hate to vacuum because of the noise, and the stress on my shoulder, so this little sweeper is a good alternative. It picks up a surprising amount of dirt, lint, and little wood chips that get tracked in from my husband bringing in wood for our woodstove.My main complaints if I could give Bissell suggestions would be that this sweeper makes an annoying rattling sound as it is used, and the rubber bumper tends to be easily dislodged.Other than that, I'm pleased with the product."
4,Sweeper,This little sweeper is great when you don't want to lug the vacuum cleaner out. Great on floors. Only complaint is keeping the handle together keeps slipping out.
5,Old school,"I recieved my Bissell Swift Sweep today as promised. Great alternative to a broom for the most part. Reminds me of when I was a kid and we didnt have an electric vacuum. It does the job with a little elbow grease to move it which is another plus because you get to burn calories while cleaning. Its just great to have on the side when you just have a small spot to hit with a vacuum. Who wants to brake out a vacuum for a foot print when you can use this bad boy 2 secs and it over, no plug up or wrapping a cord up. Its a great side piece of equipment for small jobs. I got it a day early and thats always a plus"
4,Nice little sweeper!,"I recently remodeled my house and removed all the carpets then switched to area rugs. This little sweeper picks up the majority of the debris though it doesn't do a great job with dog hair. The handle constantly comes apart which was really annoying - really, do they not test these things??? - but double stick tape took care of the problem."
5,Excellent value,"We love this for weekdays in between weekend vacuuming. It gathers tons of things off of rugs, carpets, and hardwood. The cherry on top is the little comb for our rugs."
4,hubby loves,"My husband does the vaccuming, but now he thinks this is just as good so naturally he loves this product. However, the handle keeps coming apart which is frustrating. Every so often I hear him swear and I know that once again the handle came apart."
2,The Handle Isn't the Only Problem,"The handle came apart and gouged our new wood floor. A couple of sheet metal screws permanently fixed the problem. Now, the rubber gasket surrounding the base keeps coming off. Spend a few more bucks and get a decent unit."
4,Great for area rugs,"This sweeper works great for area rugs, which is what I bought it for. Not great on hard floors, but I didn't expect it to be. OK on mid pile carpet, but again, I didn't expect this to be a vacuum/broom/sweeper. Just a sweeper. And it's a good one!"
2,Sweep semi-flop,"This is a small carpet sweeper. I should have looked more closely at the dimensions. It works fine just takes forever to go over an area to clean....back and forth over and over to get the job done. Assembly is easy, BUT, the handle sections don't stay together and I had to tape them. Storage is interesting because the handle doesn't ""lock"" in an upright position so when the closet door is opened out comes the handle. If there was a hole on the top of the handle it could be hung on a hook because it weighs next to nothing but then if the handle wasn't taped together it would fall apart. Not a good value for the price."
2,Could have been useful,"The handle pieces really could have been better made. Such as the way a certain floor duster handle has interlocking pieces at each end so that once the piece is in place, it is locked. My Bissell handle has not managed to stay together, even after striking against a hard surface as the instructions suggest. Disappointed."
5,sweeper,"me encanto esta barredora.es muy sencilla, sin cables y muy ligera.ademas su precio es super accesible.para lo que esta disenada es perfecta. si quiere uno una limpieza masprofunda no es recomendable.pero si lo que quieren es que sus alfombras luzcan limpiecitas con muy pocoesfuerzo, esta es la barredora perfecta porque recoge cuanta migaja encuentra.un detalle negativo es que no funciona bien en los suelos duros. es mucho mejor en lasalfombras, sobre todo si son de pelo corto.tiene el defecto de que el brazo donde se sostiene, se zafa constantemente, perosi usted lo pega, con alun pegamento instantaneo o con una cinta adhesiva multiusos,el problema desaparece. por el precio, vale la pena."
3,Good for the money,"I bought this sweeper because I have a black cat and a light carpet and did not want to pull out the vacuum every time she sat down on the rug. She sheds constantly. The sweeper has a little plastic cover on the end of the handle which cracked by the third time I used it. It picks up the cat hair fairly well. I find I have to go over the area a few times. I think for the money spent, you can't be too picky. It does a decent job."
1,Useless. I'd actually rate less than zero,"Ads for this sweeper are very misleading. I've used it 3 times and each time it has only picked up some dog hair and nothing else. It will never pick up: Tiny pieces of thread, paper, leaves, dirt, etc and these were all very tiny pieces. You can roll the thing back and forth over these items 20 times and all it does is move them an inch or two, never pick up. The amount of time it takes to use the tiny comb they provide to clean the roller brush takes longer than getting out the vacuum to do the job over. The handle comes in several pieces and even when assembled as instructed the handle will not stay together. It constantly falls apart and has to be put back together. You can get around this at least by using duct tape. Unless you have a very low pile carpet or berber, and the ONLY thing you ever have to pick up is pet hair, this Bissell product is a total waste of money"
1,It broke the first time I used it. Piece of junk: beware!,"All the caveats written by other reviewers are true. I had to use duct tape to hold the pieces of the handle together... and then the two prong piece connecting the pole to the sweeper itself broke! In other words, this is a perfect piece of junk. I'm still looking for something reasonably sturdy to sweep my carpet effectively when I'm not using the vacuum cleaner (which I do twice a week anyway)."
2,Handle Does Not Stay Together,"You have to put the handle of the sweeper together as part of assembling the sweeper. However, there is nothing to hold the pieces of the handle together... so it falls apart frequently! I read a review about the defective handle before I bought the product. I thought that it might be a ""one time"" thing with the reviewer that mentioned it. Well, low and behold, it happened to me as well. Its difficult to use when the handle falls apart all the time. And I even tried to duct tape it! It didn't help."
1,If you are good at duct taping,"The sweeper is indeed easy to assemble,but as other reviewers point out, the handle must be taped securely.I was never able to do that and finally gave the sweeper away. It is worth just what you pay for it."
1,Broke shortly after I received it.,The metal pole holder literally snapped off. It's beyond repair. Used it 3 times. I was pretty disappointed. IT also picked up close to nothing.
2,Not good for low pile carpet,"I purchased this because it had good reviews and it was a Bissell product. This was primarily for my office, which has some low-pile carpeting, and it barely gets anything done. This may work well for a home or 'normal' house carpeting, but is pretty bad for low-pile (most office spaces)."
5,Great sweeper,This sweeper is perfect for your small carpets and area rugs when you don't want to get the vacuum out. It does a very thorough job of cleaning quickly. Easy to put together when it arrives. Easy to use and easy to empty the collecting pan underneath.
2,Handle keeps falling off,"I had to use duct tape to keep the handles from falling off. It's annoying how ghetto is looks with the tape, but it stays in the closet. Sweeps ok, but I use the Swiffer for finer stuff."
4,Good buy for the money!,"I'm very satisfied with this sweeper. For $19.99 it is great at doing quick pickups. Make sure you follow the instructions when putting the handle together, and you'll have no problems with it staying together."
4,"Great product--- some handle issues, but Bissell took care of it","Got this product to replace our Swiffer carpet thing, for which they no longer make the inserts.I had read in the reviews that people had problems with the handle coming apart, and that to make sure this didn't happen to hammer or bang the handle parts in place. I did just that, except the small plastic cap at the top of the handle split. I wrote Bissell for a replacement, and instead, they sent me an entirely new handle, with a much more robust cap (even has a grip.)Anyway, I am a very happy customer, and the sweeper works well."
1,Piece of Junk,"The handle will not stay together. I have ""hit"" it so many times trying to get the pieces to stay together. It lasts for about two minutes then the handle comes apart while I'm sweeping my kitchen floor. It picks up most stuff but not all. If the handle would stay together long enough to do my kitchen and foyer, I'd give it three stars... But having the handle come apart repeatedly: one star. It's going back. Not recommended!"
2,Unusable due to falling extension,"The telescopic method used to assemble the handle pieces must have been designed by someone who really really hates Bissell. Hard as one tries to securely insert one piece into the other, unpredictably but inevitably the two separate while sweeping. This renders this sweeper essentially useless, unless you crouch down to use the small rod without the extension.That's too bad because it does a fairly decent job picking up crumbs and small particles. I use it on a Persian rug, on tile in the kitchen, and even does well with kitty litter on tile floor.A 4 or even 5 star product had they used a screw-in mechanism or a spring action secure lock to fasten the extension to the base rod. But they didn't. So it's a sucky 2 stars for this one."
4,Works fine,If I could have found a similar product in the same price range made in America I would have. This was made in China.
1,What a Mess,"Never received product because you delivered to wrong person and wrong address. Have previously advised you about this but have yet to have any response. Not good, Amazon."
1,broke first use.,"Got it out of the box, and swipt it across the floor and the brush fell out and it continues to fall out. I would not buy this product. Can't even use it in camper, more work then it is worth...."
3,Wanted to like it,"I was looking for a floor sweeper that didn't need batteries to replace my Quickshine sweeper whose batteries seemed to die every year. Unfortunately this wasn't it. The biggest issue I had with it was the fact there is only one brush in the center which makes it impossible to pick up crumbs in a corner. My other concern (which may be not be the case) was the metal plate underneath. It sounded like it was scraping tile floor which would be very bad on wood floors. The great things about this sweeper are the price, solid construction, easy to put together and it seemed to work very well on carpet. Like I said, I tried to like it, but ended up going back to the Quickshine electric sweeper."
3,Just okay,It Worked good for a while but the handle broke off. But I'm sure it can be easily fixed with some duct tape. I Don't use it much anymore and now just use a small vacuum that works much better.
2,Bissell manual sweeper,This Bissell Swift Sweeper model 2201-2 was too small to be useful. It actually seemed to be a toy. Only good use would be for a kid to help & follow Mom as she uses a full sized Bissell or a regular vacuum cleaner. I got stung with shipping costs to return it back to Amazon. Didn't make me happy since I bought two.
3,Amelia A,"This picks up dirt surprisingly well for a push vacuum. The one annoying thing is that the pole segments always disconnect while in use, they don' fit together very well."
4,Great helper !,"My parents had one of these all through their 60 year marriage. Since I seldom get around to taking out the electric vacuum cleaner for the kitchen carpet, I thought about this kind. I was delighted to find Bissell still made them and ordered one right away. It performs really well on little crumbs and dog hair and is really easy to empty. My husband was amazed that anything not electric was still worthwhile. Not perfect but a big help and sure worth the money!"
4,Awesome product,This product is very good. Sometimes you need to go over stuff a couple of times before it picks it up. It works very well otherwise. I use it when my baby is taking a map because it is quiet.
1,Handle comes apart,I would have to review this sweeper very low. It does sweep well when it stays together but the handle keeps coming apart in 3 places. They should have made it one piece!
1,Can Never Stay Together,"Don't waste your money on this product. I couldn't agree more with one review I read that the handle always separates and now the base came off the handle. It does sweep well but the handle or something else always breaks everytime you use it. It is just not a well made product and in my case, it scratched my floor."
3,Bissell 2201-2 Swift Sweep Sweeper,"Bought this sweeper to clean 3 large tufted wool area rugs and not have to take out the vacuum cleaner every time. One reviewer had mentioned it did well with cat's hair and it influenced my choice (I have 2 cats). The sweeper is easy to use and I had no problem with the handle. However, I need many passes over the same area to remove the cats' hair. I think the sweeper would work perfectly fine with low carpet, with high pile rug however, it requires patience. I still love the sweeper, light and easy to use and very cheap."
2,Worked well but broke after 3 months,"We were happy with this product while it worked. It was inexpensive, picked up food our toddlers dropped on the carpet quite well, and was quiet and convenient to use. However, the fact that it broke after 3 months doesn't make it seem worth it. We are now considering getting a quiet vacuum cleaner or higher quality carpet sweeper instead."
1,"It breaks apart everytime I use it, since day one!",It breaks all the time!la escobilla de en medio se cae cada vez que lo uso desde el primer día!
3,Convenient,Not my Grandmothers sweeper because it is smaller but effective for between vacuum pickup on both carpet and hard surfaces.
1,Frustrating device,This item does not work very well and falls apart easily. Poorly made and not reliable. I truly felt like this was a waste of money.
1,sweeper,"I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS SWEEPER. THE HANDLE WOULD NOT STAY IN PLACE. EVERYTIME I USED IT, THE HANDLE WOULD FALL APART. I WASTED MY MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS ITEM AT ALL."
4,Does its job nicely,"This sweeper does a fine job of cleaning up; much better than I would have expected for a manual sweeper. The only reason that I didn't give it five stars is that the dumping mechanism is a bit awkward. There is a lip on the container, so you have to reach in and dirty your hands in order to thoroughly dump it."
2,Next to Worthless,"I bought this to use in my cubicle so I didn't have to be annoying and use an electric vacuum. The rug is very flat and not shaggy at all, & I think I'd be better off with a broom and dustpan to pick up anything on it than this sweeper. You have to really push the thing and go over things many times in order for anything to get picked up - even something as simple as a bit of paper from a spiral-bound notebook's torn edge. Also, the design placing the roller brush in the very center of the head is unfortunate and makes it so that you can't get it to do anything near walls/edges unless you can move the sweeper with its sides up against them (I would expect the roller to be in the frontal part, not the center).Anyway - doesn't work for me. I'll probably toss it."
3,Disappointed!,"I was looking for a sweeper that would work well on my tile floors. Most sweepers are for low-pile carpeting, but this was marketed to work excellent on tile, laminate, etc. also. Not so! It picks up maybe 50% of what a broom would. Very disappointed. I have thick carpeting in both my living and family rooms, so I can't use it there either. It works very well on the low-pile carpeting on my stairwell and landing, but that is not really what I wanted it for. Bottom-line, do not purchase this if you are looking for a sweeper to use on tile, wood or laminate! For carpet or rugs it's great, and works as you would expect a sweeper to."
4,Easier than dragging out the vacuum,I have cats so this is great for swiftly sweeping up hairs and such. But the handle is really long and tends to get stuck which can be irritating.
2,Doesn't work on Hardwood,"I purchased this after reviewing the reviews. I was hoping that it worked; as the reviews were mixed. I bought for the hardwood floor and it is completely worthless. It picks up nothing. If you use on carpets/rugs, it works OK but for hardwood/tile-save your money. Very disappointed."
5,perfect,"easy to assemble and store away. easier than pulling out the large vacuum for everyday lint, dust and other small particles dragged into the carpet."
5,great sweeper,"Great price and works as advertised. The handle works perfect for me, and i'm sure for you too if you follow the directions, meaning you have to put the handle on a hard surface vertically after assemblage and knock on it a few times with a hammer to really have them firmly attached together. Really easy and simple, people are just too lazy or not paying attention to the assembly instructions.It makes a guy like me wouldn't mind sweeping the bathroom and kitchen floor."
4,my new best friend,I <3 this thing.When we had to get rid of our dogs I kept trying to figure out WTH people with toddlers and no pets do. Now I know they use a sweeper after every meal.It's true the handle comes undone (hence the 4 star rating) but I just superglued it. Not a big issue. I've had it 4 months or so and it's still holding.My 2 year old loves to push it around but it's akward so I'm looking for a mini version so he can clean up his own mess.
1,What is the point?,"Can this sweeper replace my broom? I'm sorry to say, but NO. It was the reason I bought it in the first place, to replace my broom and use in between vacuuming.things it can't do:does not get into cornersdoes not get right next to the wallnot as quiet as my broom. (loud and squeaky enough to wake up my baby)not as thorough as a broom.so after I'm done with this thing......I still need to go over again with a broom!things it's good for:spills in the middle of a room that has low pile carpet, such as berber. That's the only thing my broom can't do well, but that's what a vacuum is for."
2,Not very durable,The handle broke about ten minutes after opening it. I read the instructions and used the hammer for the assembly. The handle snapped in two. It was made out of cheap metal. The sweeper head worked well from what I saw with limited use. It was light weight and looked nice. After the handle broke Amazon took it back and I purchased another kind of sweeper. Too bad this one wasn't very durable!
2,breaking up,"I bought this because the reviews seem to be pretty good. The handle comes in 3 pieces and they don't interlock or anything, so I had to use tape to keep them together. A few weeks later, this rubber belt came off. I'm not sure why it's there in the first place because the sweeper can still sweep. It works, but it's ugly. I'm not sure what else will come off next. I would not recommend this product."
2,Every piece you put together comes apart and you have to glue it or smash it cuz it gets you so frustarated.,Every piece you put together comes apart and you have to glue it or smash it cuz it gets you so frustarated. The rod between your hand and the sweeper is a two part thing you put together but comes apart every time you use it. The rubber bumper around sweeper comes off every time so I don't even use that any more. the Top handle comes off. Can't Amazon sell something made well form Iowa or Ohio like the old ones? They were a dream to use ten or more years ago!
2,No Good for Cat Hair on Carpet,"This carpet sweeper couldn't pick up cat hair from the carpet (which was my primary goal). It caught some, but the rest it just pushed around. Not acceptable."
4,works great for the price,"I have a dog and a cat and a small area rug, and it just felt so wasteful each time i took out the Dyson, so i decided to give this little sweeper a try. Had it for over 4 months now, and it still works great. Both my cat and dog don't shed a lot, and whatever hair they do shed is picked up by Sweeper just fine. For smaller pieces of crumbs, i sometimes have to run it over several times, but it takes just a few extra seconds for that, so i am still happy with Sweeper (and no longer feel bad about plugging in the Dyson for such a small job). I keep Sweeper near the rug, so it doesn't get moved around much, and the handle has NOT fallen out on me as I used it."
5,Pleased with my Purchase,"I bought the Bissell swift sweep for my mom, she totally loves it as it is easy to use and she can carpet each room in the house without having to pull out the vacuum and no loud noise.... very reasonable and economical does a very thorough job on the carpets and floors without any hassle.... Thanks Bissel and Thanks Amazon."
4,If it weren't for the handle...,"I bought this at Lowes Home Improvement for 9.97 - it's their regular price. The handle pieces do come out but don't despair! I had some carpet tape (double-sided) lying around and wrapped only a small piece around each end before I put it back together. It works like a charm. For how long, I don't know, but for the price I paid and how well it works otherwise, it will be worth investing in another role of tape in about a hundred years or so.I can't drag the vacuum out all the time, don't want to and besides the dogs go nuts. This works as well as the carpet sweeper I remember pushing around as a little girl so I gave it an extra star for nostalgia. Gets all crumbs (don't expect it to get ground in dog hair) and gets all lint & small things you'd normally drag out the Hoover for. And No electricty needed!! If you miss the sound however, you can always hum!"
4,Bissell Sweeper,"Kicking my self for not buying this years ago. Quicker than taking out the vac for annoying little items.Reading the reviews, I simply glued the handle pieces so there is no problem.This does the job quickly and priced so its a trivial purchase. Beats the heck out of plugging something in the wall and messing with the cord.I was tempted to extoll the virtues of this being a green product with no electricity but could not do that with a straight face.Bottom line, great little product."
5,It does a good job!,"I have an Australian Sheperd that molts every spring and fall. I needed something small to get the excess hair and debris without having to drag out the giant vacuum every day. This works great! I use it carpet, tile, wood, and throw rugs. It picks up tons of hair and dirt. It does not do corners and you have to push it forward enough to allow the rollers to go through full cycle. Not a problem with the handle of you follow the included directions. Great buy!"
3,Does the job,"I use this in my classroom. One of the students has the job of floor inspector, which involves using the sweeper to pick up any crumbs, pieces of paper, etc off the floor. It is a popular job because of the sweeper. But the sweeper can take several passes to pick up some things. Still, a good value for the price."
5,Brings back memories,"My grandmother had one of these. I used to sweep her carpets for her when I was little. This carpet sweeper is great. It works fine and is handy to have around for quick clean ups. The only thing is that if you don't take a mallot and hammer in the handle pieces, they won't be tight and they will keep falling apart. Banging it on the floor as suggested does not give you a very permanent hold. I love it."
4,EVERY home w/ small children should have one!,"Would have given this item a 5-star rating, however the handle does tend to come apart easily. But, a little silicone caulk took care of that problem! This item is a MUST HAVE for anyone with pets and especially small children. My son is the original ""Hansel""....leaving crumbs wherever he has been. I used to get irritated and grumble about having to lug out our heavy vacuum several times a day. Now that I have my little light-weight picker-upper, I can just do a quick run over the carpet and the crumbs are all picked up. Seems to work equally well on carpet, as well as hardwood, linoleum, etc.Always saw these kinds of sweepers before, but they were just too expensive to own. For $20, I decided to take a gamble. Plus, I knew Bissell is a good name. It is worth every penny!"
2,I should have listened!,"Breeze to put together, getting it to stay together is a different story. Yes, the handle does break apart! The size of the sweeper itself is that of a childs toy and picks up just as well, if not worse. For the price, I wish I had bought the less expensive Bissel at Walmart. Oh, and the mess I had with shipping was awful! Please, don't waste your money on this item."
4,If I Asked You Would You Stay,"In the novel, If I Asked You Would You Stay, there were two teens wondering and looking for their place in life. They have never met, but soon after they do, they fall in love. If I Asked You Would You Stay was a very good book. It was interesting and if I had to rate this book, I would rate it 8/10. (Ten being the highest and one being the lowest.) Although in some places it does move at a slow pace. Even though it moves at a slow pace, I recommend this book for anyone who likes to read adventure novels, but also for the people who like a little bit of romance in their novels."
3,It was a Great book but Slow,This book was about two teenagers that have not yet found their place in the world and have no idea where their future is headed. They are two very different people but learn to look deeper within theirselves and find caring and love for eachother. I didn't really like the ending and it was sorta slow for them to fall in love. But otherwise I recommend this book.
1,I hoped it would get better!,"I did not purchase this book, I received it as a prize at a networking event. I felt bad that I hadn't touched the book for a few months but I was already deep in other personal development books. When I did finally give it some time, I was very disappointed. Dohrmann begins with a personal anecdote that lasts way too long and leaves you wondering what the point of the story is. Dohrmann uses a technique of capitalizing entire words (like THIS) to create emphasis. This may work for him as a speaker but it makes for a very frustrating read. This will be the last time I deviate from NY Times best selling authors."
1,Waste of time and money...,All I can say is about 30 minutes into the book i have no idea what I'm reading other than his experiences he's had... big deal.. book is now in the garbage..
5,"BJ Dohrmann, the other Napolean Hill","Anyone who likes Napoleon Hill, Og Mandino, and the Super Stars of philosophy will love BJ Dohrmann's books. The family helped found the city of San Francisco, CA; with the most interesting people coming by the house as BJ Dohrmann grew up. I envy the childhood, but have the next best thing in his books. I highly recommend anything written/said by BJ Dohrmann be paid close attention."
4,WOW,BJ Dohrmann has captured what it takes to be a Super Achiever. He has taught us the secrets to super achieve and to be our best.BJ Dohrmann knows his stuff.
2,Hopelessly mediocre..,"Lisa Smedman's Psychotrope takes the fascinating new ""Deep Resonance"" and ""Otaku"" Shadowrun concepts and churns out a rather uninteresting, cliche'd novel. Characters are introduced and discarded at a rapid pace until it becomes difficult to remember who any of them are. Virtually (no pun intended) the entire novel takes place inside the Matrix, and yet somehow fails to make the Matrix a immersive setting. It's not just disappointing, its absolutely uninteresting. Find a different Shadowrun book."
3,QB Installation Problems,"Installation on two computers running off a common server was very difficult. Each program has to be updated with new downloads and will not work together with different versions. Running off the server is counter intuitive as well. Then when we tired to do our payroll, we had to jump thru hoops to avoid buying the intuit service, a real pain."
3,Quickbooks for wholesale,"Better than the last version, but still not perfect. And support for when their program goes screwey is an additional $200."
2,Green Business Overview PDX,"This video is quite dry for the title Passion for Sustainability. Kudos to all the entrepreneurs and activists interviewed, but I had to watch this in three segments as it was not particularly inspiring."
5,The final work in the presentation of Hasidism to the world,"Maurice Friedman Buber's great interpreter and faithful student said that ""in this book Buber completed his lifework of recreating and interpreting Hasidism. Here he makes explicit the place of Hasidism among world religions, contrasting it with biblical prophecy, Spinoza, Freud, Sankara, Meister Eckhart, Gnosticism, Christianity, Zionism, and Zen Buddhism.""For all those interested in the spiritual side of the religious life this is an important volume."
3,A few good cuts,"I've had this on LP for years, and really like a couple of the cuts. Nothing great here musically, but still pleasant to listen to."
2,"4 parts cheesy organ, 1 part Astrud's lovely voice","I disagree with the positive reviewers completely. I am a casual Astrud listener who unfortunately bought based on their reviews, and was let down. I just wanted Astrud's lovely voice with simple accompaniment. What I got was an organ drowning out her voice. I have since bought the Silver Collection, which I think will suit better most people wanting a casual listening experience where the emphasis is truly on her lovely, simple voice."
4,"Space opera, with an expected ""twist"" ending","I read this book, or parts of it over 30 (!) years ago when I wanted blasters and spaceships and lots of BEMs. It is one of the items in my 'keeper' library. The Rull enemy has a fantasy element (shapechanger) that will appeal, and a cold-blooded ability to eradicate the humans it opposes. Read it as an adventure yarn, and not as a comment on civilization."
3,Classic SF adventure,"The War Against the Rull by A.E. Van VogtThis is a pretty good adventure story (or series of stories) with lots of classic SF elements: ravenous over-sized monsters, mysterious aliens, ray guns, an interstellar war between space empires, interstellar diplomacy, and an heroic scientist who has to talk sense into closed-minded politicians and military men. The War Against the Rull is a solid effort worth the time of classic SF fans.I read the 1999 Tor edition of this 1959 fix up, based on short stories Van Vogt wrote in the 1940s. Sadly, the fine cover painting is misattributed; it is by Hubert Rogers, who did lots of work for the pulps."
3,Nice old-fashioned scifi,"I have a ancient, eternally dusty edition of this book, and even if it's really, as I said, old-fashioned, it's a nice way to have a good time. And it has at least one really interesting creature, the ezwal."
5,People are asleep,I pity anyone who didnt run out and by this musical mayhem. I have been a fan since Goodie Mob and still find myself bobbing my head to all the old stuff as well. I have no favorites because I love them all. The ONE is by far my club jam though.With his words over a club classic by DJ Jimi.I put it on rotation.If ya'll aint know the SOUTH is here and like Puffy we aint goin nowhere.I wish the group would grow up and settle their so called creative differences.It's funny how creative differences also equal big EGOS.This as well as all other Goodie Mob songs ride on all my Road Trips.Cee-lo is indeed a soul machine as well as a powerful poet.Listening to him always reminds me of my best friend who I have known for 20 years of my life and I am only 26. Keep It Moving Cee-lo.
5,Soul Machine Indeed,This cd has been playing in my car for a week straight. I love it. I've never written a review of anything in my life. That is how much i love it. Almost enough to buy copies for all my friends to share the love.
4,Progressive Work Of Art,"Cee-lo Green decides to move in a different direction with this release and it pays off. It is a collection of his many styles all rolled up into an album. Actually, this is something your parents can get into. This is a good, progressive work of art. I just wish Goodie Mob could squash the beef and get back together."
1,One of the crappiest CD's I've heard in a long time,"I loved the Timbaland produced song ""I'll Be Around"", so I thought, ""Ya know I think I'll get the CD for the heck of it. The singles pretty good, so why not buy the album!"" And so I did.I made the biggest mistake ever. I wasted thirteen bucks on this good for nothing CD. I've heard ""I'll Be Around"" so many times now that I'm sick of it. In other words, there is no other reason to put this CD in my CD player except for that song and the Neptune produced songs, ""Art of Noise"" and ""Let's Stay Together"", which are just alright.The other songs of this so called album, are crap. This Cee-Lo guy can't even rap or sing! What will he do know? If someone can't sing then surely they must be able to rap! Well, Cee-Lo proved me wrong.Don't waste you're time or money to even think about this CD! Stray away from it as far as you can; it stinks!"
1,BUY THIS AND REGRET FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE,"Cee-Lo is not a soul machine but indeed a 'stealing machine'.he stole my money. this album is crap + garbage + your nightmare. i'll never support Cee-Lo again ever.i saw this fool on MTV sweet 16 show, and his voice wasn't so squeaky. as a matter of fact, he had this heavy voice that rappers have. but in this cd, he sings like a little girl and entire CD, he just tries to sing with this squeaky voice. obviously, Cee-Lo is trying to imitate someone elses' voice. his real voice isn't that squeaky. this album made my ear drum to bleed. WORST CD EVER!! TOGETHER WITH HIS PREVIOUS ALBUM!i just wanna slap Cee-Lo if i get to see him. he ripped me off. just think about this one big chubby guy in the little studio trying to made this annoying squeaky voice that's not even his real voice.....and he even tries to rap, i find that real funny. Just search for all 1-star reviews!! they have the same opinion that i do!!"
3,See how different he is?!?,"Feels like Cee is trying a little too hard to prove how multi-talented he is on here. There are a few standout tracks where he puts together an amazing rap or sings beautifully but the majority of this long solo disc feels overwrought lyrically and musically. Unfortunately in the sliding scale of hip-hop, an album like this stands far more unique then it ought."
2,Viscera,"I think that the book was appropriately named, because some of the reactions that I had where exactly that ....visceral. I understand what Cara Bruce was trying to accomplish and did accomplish. It was to take you to the brink of the taboos we have about sexuality. I always welcome a new approach to writing, and I especially enjoy erotica. Unfortunately there were a few stories that crossed the line for me. The only thing I could compare it to would be if you were to read a story from the perspective of the police officers that commited the rape of Abner Louima and how much fun they had while engaging in the act. If that sort of thing turns you on, then you should have no problem reading and enjoying the stories in this book. It is not a book for the weak or squeemish."
4,VISCERA bats .500 and That's Pretty Decent,"It's half silly and half disturbing. Half hackneyed and half revelatory. Some of the stories function at a sixth grade level, while others are worthy of Dickens. I'm perfectly divided on this book, and, I think, that's why it's so effective. (And I doubt that any two people will draw the same lines.) I won't name the stories that don't work, but two of VISCERA's best are GIRL ON A TRAIN and 32 CHERRIES. Both perfectly exemplify sexuality's dark side without resorting to Gothic imagery, murder, and/or weapons. Check it out. Consider it $12.95 half well-spent."
2,"Not the ""VHS"" version","I had purchased the VHS version of this show some years ago. It is a great video. Jack Perkins has one of those great ""booming baritone"" voices for doing voice-over work and a great personality to go along with it. When I saw that a DVD of the show was available, I bought it. Within minutes of playing it, I discovered that this DVD version is NOT simply the VHS version on DVD but an entirely different one. So if you're thinking that this DVD is just a ""remastered"" version of the original VHS version, be forewarned. I can't speak highly enough of the ""original"" VHS version. Absolutely one of my favorite Christmas videos."
2,Not for younger children,"For the most part, I thought this was a very interesting DVD. However, I let my 3 and 7 year old children watch it with me. Near the beginning, there was a graphic cartoon image of three little boys who had mutilated and stuffed into a pickle barrel. St. Nicholas brought them back to life and was able to reassemble their bodies. I really didn't think it was necessary to have such a violent visual image. Also, near the end of the movie, there was a brief segment about how Santa is not always seen as a good guy---there was a movie clip of some murderer in a Santa suit chasing a person with an ax. Again, was that really necessary? There should definitely be a warning at the beginning of the show telling parents that there are some images which might not be suitable for young kids. Or, here's a crazy thought, just delete the violent scenes! It's a Christmas DVD which the whole family should be able to watch."
3,"Good for adults, not kids","I purchased this movie for my middle school students. I needed something to end our ""non-fiction"" writing unit, and since we'd studied biographies and it was December, this seemed like a good pick. Unfortunately, I liked it a lot more than they did. The guests they interviewed and the history behind Santa was captivating for me, but the kids all fell asleep! Basically, I think you'll enjoy this if you are a History Channel lover like me, a Christmas fan, or just someone who likes stories behind pop culture. However, the kids said it was ""soooooooo boring"". I should've known! :)"
2,It was okay,"I got this movie for my 5 year old son because he quit believing in Santa so I was hoping to show him that Saint Nick was a real man at one time so maybe my son would at least know some where it all came from. It showed him a little bit but things need to be explained to him in a different kind of way. This movie basically just kept saying ""Maybe Santa is real and maybe he's not."" My son Knows hes not real (he's got a mind like a scientist, you have to physically show him things or he just doesn't believe. Everything needs to be proven too him) so this movie just wasn't for him. But I guess it was alright other then the fact it was not what I was looking for."
4,Excellent prog rock,"I really enjoyed this album. The musicianship is top notch, and the sound has elements of Yes, early Rush, Genesis and other classic prog rock bands. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that the lyrics aren't as polished as the music. Still, this one grabbed me on first listen, and I still spin it quite a bit. Highly recommended."
3,Derivative but good,"As I listened for the first time, I kept thinking, ""that was Genesis"", ""that was Rush"", ""that was Jethro Tull"" . . . the music is good and well played but has progressed very little from the great sources that it copies. I would love for these guys to stop playing the music that they loved to hear when they were young and challenge themelves to develop a sound that is new and unique. Maybe the second album. I'll buy it, because short of Spock's Beard, ther's little else out there that has the complexity that makes ""progressive"" rock interesting."
4,"EXELLENT ENGLISH-SCHOOL ""PROGRESSIVE"" ROCK","Crucible is a tasty,versatile band that has all the elements:arranging,dynamics,and great individual and group playing.For fans of classic Yes,Genesis,and Rush,this album offers lyrical and subtle tracks of a type rarely heard in a landscape of expatriate metalheads posing as ""progressive"" rockers.Great analog keys and acoustic guitar round out this ""English"" style album."
5,PGP! Pretty Good Prog!,"Saw them at NEARFest, where the keys were way down in the mix, but still bought the disk, 'cause they sounded pretty good. The disk was good to start, and improves one each listen."
3,good ol' fashioned art rock,"Crucible go straight for the heart of 70s art rock with Tall Tales. And that's fine with me. While I'd hardly call it ""progressive"" (not that the band would care one way or the other, I suspect), it fits in with mid-70s Yes, Genesis, etc. They obviously love what they do and do it well. Can't ask for more than that.If you dig this, also try House of Usher. For that matter, if you're an Usher fan, pick this up."
3,Not too shabby,"These guys aren't too bad. They have a great ""sound,"" including all analog keyboards: hammond, mellotron, arp synth, and the beautiful, much-too-overlooked Yamaha electric grand. (More people should be using this instrument!) I would really have to classify these guys as ""neo-prog,"" along the lines of IQ, except with all-analog 'boards and a singer who can really sing! All the guys play very well and the arrangements are reasonably imaginative. The writing is somewhat bland, though. I'd look at this as a pretty good 1st effort that shows promise for the future."
5,an eloquent testament to the power of writing,"Susan Zimmerman has found meaning and purpose in what many would consider a hopeless situation. She shares the gift of her daughter, Katherine, through her writing. This book is so much more than a writer's guide-it is a guide to accompany the journey of life, love, loss and grief. Each chapter begins with a moving story which illustrates the point; included are specific exercises to help the writer get started. This book will have even those who never intended to write reaching for a pen and notebook. People who are already writing will find validation on every page."
1,not what i expected,"nowhere in the information could i find that this is ONLY book 1. i had anticipated the whole work, that seemed to be what was being sold to me."
4,Burning...,"Finch is a good band and this album proves that.""What it is to burn?""Not hearing this disc.The lyrics, guitar, drums, rythmn and so much more.The vocals are some of the best in the genre imo.Finch really put together a great effort with this release.Finch is great live, too.It's a 4* - almost 5*.I'd definitely buy this CD again."
5,One of A Kind - There is NO substitute for Finch,"Simply amazing band. When you hear the word ""emo,"" you probably think of bands like Dashboard Confessional. Not true here. Finch has a unique blend of emo/hardcore/punk/hard rock that is overwhelming at times. From beginning to end, this album takes you on a rollercoaster of emotions and feeling. From the softer side of Finch (seen through such tracks as ""Ender"" and ""Without You Here"") to their hardcore alter ego (booming through with ""Grey Matter"" and ""Project Mayhem,"" both lent background screaming by Glassjaw's Daryl Palumbo), you will see so many sides of one band, that it is almost certain you will find at least ONE song you like no matter what musical preference you have. I am even satisfied with their more ""pop""-ish songs, ""Letters To You"" and ""Stay With Me."" This album is a definite MUST for any music fan."
3,Pretty good....,"but a bit of a letdown as well. Post Script was the song I heard on the Atticus compilation and he reason I purchased What it is To Burn. I give these guys major credit for trying to mix it up here, but the disk just seems to lack cohesion. Great band though,looking forward to hearing more from them."
4,unclassified and loving it,"This is an excellent album, if you are a fan of loud, sometimes mindless, screaming. What it is to burn, New Beginnings, Grey Matter and Untitled are rad tracks. The guitar and screaming give Finch a certain edge that is all their own. It's a good break in the drive-thru norm although their presence is still felt in the lyrics. Be warned, this band does not ""bridge any gaps"" between genres. I wouldn't even put them in a genre. They're just pretty good music. Don't overanalyze them, don't try to classify them, just listen. For all of you out there that do, grow up, Santa claus isn't real. If you want straight emotional music with meaningful lyrics look for Thursday or Taking Back Sunday. Don't get me wrong, Finch has gnarly tunes, and I would seriously recommend buying it. But don't be sucked into the ever growing need to classify music."
3,Inconsistent,"I love some songs on this album and could do without the rest. I think Finch sounds the best when they play their mid-tempo songs because all the rest sound like they are trying to emulate other bands or strive for a particular sound (for example, punk). For instance, ""What It Is To Burn"" and ""New Beginnings"" stand on their own as compositions while ""Project Mayhem"" sounds exactly like Glassjaw (I know, I know, Daryl sings on this song). There are quite a few gems on this album, namely the first four tracks, the title track, and ""Ender"", but the rest pale in comparison.Three stars due to the inconsistency, which, unfortunately, follows the band into their second album. I recommend this album if you want to hear some good songs of the wide-ranging emo genre, but don't expect a masterpiece. This is a young band showing that they are . . . well, young."
5,best cd i ever bought,"If there were a better new band out there, i couldn't tell you who it was. Finch is the best thing to happen to music since the first guitar was invented. Heavy and soft, loud and quiet, whatever you're in the mood for, this cd has it all. With some guest vocals from Glassjaw's Daryl Palumbo on Grey Matter and Project Mayhem, punk-like songs like Letters to You and Stay With Me, and just mellow beauties like Ender, what serious music fan wouldn't love this cd?"
5,awesome!!,"this is possible the greatest album I have evr had the privilage of listening to. Every track is amazing, powerful and effective in its own way. The manner in which the album varies song to song yet still manages to flow as an album is incredible. And Ender is one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard. There are simply no weak links on this record, no album tracks whatsoever.There are at least 5 obvious singles should the band choose to release any,and with the way that Finch mould emo-core, pop-punk and hard rock, they have every chance of being huge. Dont be surprised if in a year or two this band is absolutely everywhere you turn. With releases like this they deserve to be"
4,Great Album...,"This is a great cd! Well, I have nothing but good things to say about every track on this record. The great thing about these guys is there ability to go from a heavy track, to a pop-punk kinda song, to a beautiful melodic song like ""Perfection through silence"" ... what a powerful song. As far as their lyrics go..these guys have a lot to say. I think that the future has a great place for this band, these guys know where their going and they have a message...soon I think they will make a name for themselves."
4,EXCELLENT!,"This cd is definitely a must have for any cd collection. it comes right at you and screams in your face, and the raw emotion of singer Nate Barcalow's voice is just amazing at times. his versatility in vocal styles makes finch beyond amazing, yet they don't use this in all of their songs. what it is to burn is definitely the best, and if you see them perform this live, you will absolutely love this band. best of luck with the next cd, match this one and you'll be well on your way to success!"
3,Hmmm...,"I'm not sure how I feel about this album. I think that some songs sounded a bit too much like All American Rejects which in my opinion is not a compliment. It was an okay CD but if I could go back I don't think I'd buy it, i'd burn it from a friend or something but not spend money on it. I think that in time we could be hearing great things from this band, their just a little unexperianced."
5,totally rockin,"i first listened to finch off the dragging the lake cd and i got totally addicted. i tried to get the cd as soon as i heard them and i couldnt stop. i listened to them nonstop b/c they were just soooooo good. my faves off of this album have to be three simple words, stay with me, and grey matter. get this cd its worth it"
2,Mediocre,"I was expecting more emotion in this album after hearing their single What it is to Burn on the radio. Some of the songs come through w/that such as:track 4, Grew Mattertrack 7, Without You Hereand track 12, EnderOtherwise I would skip this one unless you re really a fan of Finch."
5,best drive-thru artist,"Finch is by far the best band on Drive-Thru, i mean they aren't even pop-punk! They're kinda heavey, especialy Project Mahyem. But all the songs are extremely well written. And the vocals are great.Every song is great though, from the single Letters to You to the 13 minuet long Ender. Far more talented then most of the bands on Drive-Thru that's for sure. And not every song on the c.d. sounds almost the same. I'm suprised they haven't gotten the recognition they deserve. But I bet they will, hopefully someday soon."
5,Buy This CD Now!,"Hey everyone! You should definately get this cd. Finch is becoming more popular everyday due to their amazing talents. Nate, the lead vocalist, wrote all of the songs on ""What It Is To Burn"". The cd is packed with high energy beats that can fit any mood. (Especially if you are angry- you can scream along with Nate) You have to hear it to believe it. So buy it now!"
3,good listening,good tone....driving. the drummer is a bit heavy on the double bass....but if you like that - great.
1,Drive-Thru killed emo.,"I admit I used to adore this band above all others. Now that I've learned a bit more about the 'scene' and emo genre as a whole, I have realized that Finch is hardly emo at all. They do have potential, but they are just incredibly overrated and have little originality. Lyrics are a tad shallow, as are most of Drive-Thru's bands, and vocals are shaky. I suppose this would be alright to download and burn, but don't spend money on it. Finch is more of a ""gateway emo band"" than anything else."
1,A one song album deserves one star,"I simply can't believe the reviews below. Generous or what! Other than the first track which has some good hooks and a nimble tempo, the rest of the album is lame, derivative and immature. ""What It Is to Burn"" is a one hit beverage coaster. Don't get suckered in."
4,Dialate D Sucks,"Its true that this album is nothing special really when it comes to emo, its pretty much the norm, but to say that finch don't have talent is a big mistake. Dialate D or whatever his name is proved that he listens to crappy music by saying that there are thousands of bands out there with talent. In reality, theres probably about 100 bands that i would even consider listening to. Finch is one of them. Grow up, just because posers like it doesnt mean you cant."
2,dont get it,i dont get it all they do is scream big deal if your gonna try and be metal be it but dont have tough screams and soft music....PASS THIS!
4,finch rules,"finch rules. they're debut cd what it is to burn is awesome. it has awesome hard-hitting music and lyrics that will burn right through you. its awesome.KEY SONGS: LETTER TO YOU, AWAKE, STAY WITH ME, ENDER!!!(the best song on the cd) UNTITLED, WHAT IT IS TO BURN."
5,"good, but too xpensice","Good but expensive. I like the band, but making music videos for MTV is selling out, and they sure have done a good job of that"
3,Incredibly Not Incredible,"I saw Finch based on the fact that I saw them on the Garageband.com site and they listed the Deftones as an influence. I saw them on the Drive-Thru records showcase and just thought they were terrible. After thinking about it a little bit I decided it might've been the mix and borrowed the album from a co-worker. I listened to it immediately and thought it was just average.One night I was hanging with my brother and decided to go pick it up after we were talking about it. Now I realize just how blah it really is. Don't get me wrong there are some good tracks. The best on the album is ""Without You Here,"" which really sounds like it could be from the Deftones latest release White Pony. I also did like the single ""Letters to You,"" enough but my biggest complaint is the overusage of kick-drums. It just sounds so bad to use a double bass pedal, no matter what music you play. If you're a Deftones fan or just an emocore fan move on from this album. You're wasting your money."
4,Thanks so much for real music.,"Dear Finch, i personally want to congratulate you on your first full length. i also want to thank you for being one of the few bands out there who communicate earnestly and whose lyrics have a point and really affect people. when i first heard letters to you last october, i listened to it the entire night. it described exactly how i felt inside for my friends. it just blew me away. now today, the day of the release of what it is to burn, the album lived up to surpass my expectations for it. post script and ender were just amazing. i listened to the whole thing about 6 times. so thanks again. bye bye."
2,A very AVERAGE album,"It was over a year ago when i first heard of this band. Theres been all this hype about them so went to get the album but it didnt really live up to expectation. Some of their songs are besically a pop song with heavy guitars. A good example is 'Letters To You'. Dont get me wrong, i like this song. They are like a pop punk band but only heavier. This is a sort of album 14 year old girls would listen to and sing the songs when they get to skool. Finch id say are just another emo/hardcore band. If you really want an amazing album that lives up to expectations, get The Used. They're like finch minus the pop punk and with more emotions!"
4,"A Little hard, but it grows on you","Im not a big fan of screamo bands, actually i hate bands like slipknot, korn, etc... but there are some amazing songs on this cd that make it good. and they have punk roots...they are from Drive Thru Records. New Beginning, Letter To You, Post Script, Three Simple Words, and What it is to Burn are my favorite songs. Finch is an exciting new band, and I expect good things from them in the future"
2,NOT FOR OUTDOOR USE,"I don't care what the picture shows, the tag on the plug says ""indoor use only"". Picture is deceptive, and should be removed."
3,Whatever.,"Now i like witch hunter actualy but its just too typical you know? For example it is very repeteive each episode seems to begin with someone dying and witch apears than hunters solve bunch of ""puzzles"" and it ends with 3 minute make 1 minute fightwitch dies some thoughtfull eyes THE END."
4,A small improvement,"I reviewed the first volume, and said that I was disappointed with this series. It's slow moving story and bland characters made it hard for me to get interested...and stay awake. I am a fan of good stories. Even though this anime has a slow paced vibe, it has a very serious story. The story is starting to get a bit better. I actually enjoyed volume 2 quite a bit more than volume 1. The characters have begun to develop a bit more, which is the key to an interesting series. So far, this anime isn't great, but there is potential. I am, however, still a bit disappointed. I'll keep watching and let you know how this show improves, or doesn't. At this point, I kind of think that it's a waste of money."
5,Unique insight into yoga practice,"After almost 25 years of practice, this book not only provided new insights but also validated my own experiences. I recommend it so highly I gave away my first copy. Ideal for both beginners and advanced practictioners, it expresses the inner spirit of yoga without the mystical fog that surrounds many advanced books."
4,Unusual book by an interesting teacher,"Erich, if you have ever experienced his teaching in person, is an interesting teacher. He has a very exploratory nature when it comes to yoga and frequently practices at home and makes up new postures as he goes. He has a pretty lengthy book here that has a lot to offer that you may not have seen quite that way before. If you are interested in a fresh new look at yoga, this book could be for you!"
5,A profound underserstanding of Yogas true meaning,"I have gone through many Yoga books and tried many ""yoga courses"". It always seemed to be a struggle against my mind and body. Somehow i just didn't get the deeper meaning and it remained a form of physical exercise. Fortunately i began to develop some intuitive understanding and awareness in my practice. That's when I came across Schiffmann. His book expressed beautifully what I was beginning to realize. Every asana I have tried using Schiffmann's approach has been a joy to practice. Buy this book. Use it. It will change your life."
4,Great book,I had to purchase this book for a yoga class at school. So far I have thoroughly enjoyed it. I really love the breathing and meditation techniques. Yoga is a life changing physical mental and spiritual process which I will continue to practice here on out... thanks!
5,The Essential Book on Yoga,"This is by far the most practical,lucid and inspiring book on yoga I have ever read.I am a yoga teacher and have been practicing for over twenty years.It is the only book I know of that teaches how to develope a truely personal practice,based on the experience of truth.Through the cultivation of inner awareness,gentleness and compassion the author guides us to connect with,honor and express the truth of our divine nature .This is the heart of yoga. I recommend that if anyone reads this book and doesn't connect with it immediately,keep reading until you do!It's well worth the effort."
5,A Beautiful Soul,"I actually haven't read this book, but have been taking yoga classes from the man himself here in Santa Monica, and just realized this book exists.. All I want to add is that Erich is the most radiant happy being I think I've ever met. Such a beautiful soul, with such a gentle and beautiful practice. Erich is most definitely the real deal! I look forward to reading this. I know already that he has much to teach!"
3,Great Yogi - Good Book,"Erich is a great modern yogi and he writes a good book.His knowledge is amazing.If you in the discovery phase of your yoga practice, you simply cannot go wrong with buying this book and using the information he presents."
2,Distracting,"There seems to be a handful of great poses in the book, I'll give it that. But the nice lady on the cover is not an indication of its content. The entire book is just one man with a pony tail doing all the poses and he made me inexplicably uncomfortable. Also the discussions on each pose really wasn't what I was looking for. I returned this book for ""Hatha Yoga Illustrated"" by Kirk, which I enjoy MUCH more."
3,good but not the best,"The first few chapters seemed like the usual mumbo jumbo. He went to India and saw a guru and learned some important ""values"". The second section where he describes about breathing and asanas is the most useful along with his description of how to do the poses. I think he is also over-elaborate in doing the poses."
2,Too Theory Based,"Renowned yoga master Erich Schiffmann offers an easy-to-follow technique. Through simple instruction and essential illustrations, this book reveals more than one hundred poses and yoga routines for all levels of ability that will slow or even reverse aging, increase stamina and strength, and slim and tone the body; a complete program of meditation to promote self-realization, decrease stress, and promote creativity. Discover how to feel balanced, centered, and coordinated, increase flexibility, eliminate pain, and become free of life's negativity through the spirit and practice of Yoga. In my opinion, there are a lot of better yoga books out there and this one is a bit advanced, especially if you're a beginner. This isn't one I'd recommed to anyone.. there's too much theory and not enough yoga."
4,Not for the timid,"This book is definitely for advanced students. My daughter loves it because she is 18 and can more easily twist herself into a pretzel than I could ever dream of. Eric is amazing and if nothing else, I look at this book periodically for the WOW factor and keep dreaming that some day I'll be able to do these postures."
5,Worth every penny,Presentation is more than just copy and paste data to powerpoint slides. This DVD shows you all the techniques to make your presentation more effective. I really learn a lot from it and presentation to senior management no longer a tooth-pulling process for me.
2,Seller does not describe the items accurately.,"""Like New"" has a new meaning, the cover has transparent plastic stock to it all over and the side has coffee (or something) sucked up in to the paper."
1,Interesting reading... no education to be found,"I read this book many years ago, while employed at AAM. Found it to be very Disappointing & lacked the passion I was hoping to learn from it. The book starts out talking about stories & how he asked every employee "" How can I help you do your job? What is it you need?"" The second half of the book talks in management/manufacturing lingo. Must be why it's a MUST-HAVE for Purdue students. As it turns out Mr. Dauch broke the union, saved labor cost, raised prices of products & made Billions. Let it be known, all business's who do business with AAM are most often owned my a Dauch family-friend or colleague. True americanism at its finest. I (and many former employees) will never buy anything with a AAM product installed in it. By the way, after giving up on this book, I sold it to the first person who bid on it. 1 STAR is simply too much."
1,"Fine as pullers, lousy as cutters","I can see this pulling nails fine but I bought it for end cutting and it's terrible at this. The blade is dull; dull in fact to the point that it's hardly even a blade at all. The casting of the tool is poor. The cutters don't close evenly, there is a large gap on one side."
2,Non-functional,"First, and most importantly, the server doesn't keep the coffee hot. It does not have a glass thermal lining (I should have known to look for that feature before I purchased this product.)After a half hour in the server, the coffee is lukewarm and I have to reheat it in the microwave.Secondly, the screw-on top has some features that seem to serve no purpose - a button on top that I assume is intended to release the vacuum so the coffee can be poured out. It doesn't work, you have to loosen the lid itself. Also, the lid comes apart into several pieces for cleaning I guess. But it collects coffee inside the hollow lid and then that coffee dribbles all over the place."
4,Very nice!,"I enjoyed this book very much and expect to use it quite often in the future. It's like Feng Shui but easier to understand and incorporate. I only wish there were more general spells (like how to create coziness, etc.) in the book."
4,More Fun than Fung Shui,"The title and subtitle sum up what this book is pretty well. A little bit spell book, a little bit decorating book, she talks about making a house a home through some effort on your part.It's a nice little book with some nice ideas, but she seems to try a little too hard to take Pagan ideas to non-Pagan readers. Christmas, Hanukkah and Kwanzaa, for instance, presented in a Pagan way might appeal to many Pagans, but not to many Christian or Jewish readers. It has a feel of effort to it, like she's trying to sell the book to a group that never visits the ""New Age"" section of the bookstore.Still, things are presented in a very clear way, suggesting materials and moon phases for the most appropriate times for the spells. None of the materials are very exotic, so the spells are indeed accessible to anyone who is of a mind to try their hand at a little magic.The index is quite good, but unfortunately no bibliography. Not a bad book if Hestia/Vesta-type rituals are important to you."
4,Simple spells for home and hearth,Purchased this book for fun it is very enjoyable I would recomend this book to any one great service A++
5,Great Value,"Very happy with this purchase, it has helped me very much with constipation, and I have also noticed that PMS is so much better! Great value for the price."
4,Great read!,"Wonderful book ! Pay no attention to other carping comments.The book that made me understand about tides. It has believable characters, great plot, tension--this should be made into a movie. I'm already casting the principal characters in my mind..."
3,decent read,"This book is a fluffy but fun read about some Brazilians going to the moon. It has a large cast of characters with difficult names. It reminds one of ""Outland"" more than any known space books. What the heck...it's a hoot. Not much substance but an entertaining airplane book."
2,Readable,I had a bit of trouble following some of what was going on. The romance seemed a bit forced to make the story more interesting.
4,Film in its Most Perfect Form,"""Waiting for Godot"" is, undeniably, at first glance nothing more than the rambling of two old men stuck in a single set of mist and fog, rock and two scraggily trees. However, as the film progresses it becomes apparent that Breckett is leading us to something more than a dark, languid poetry but a deeper meaning, symbolizing a subject that we can all relate to in some way."
3,"Heavy, but nice looking tank","All air tanks are heavier, but this one just seems over the top...... Not sure why they have a gauge that goes up to 6,000 psi when you can only put 3,000 in it..... I have used it several times, and it seems to deplete fairly fast- but the average BPS is amazing. I would save up and get the carbon fiber tanks...... WAY lighter......"
1,stinks,this item was terrible. it is false advertisement. the picture of the product on the page is much different then what you will actually get.
1,48 cu 3000 psi pure energy tank,tank is great but shipping sucked and i didn't get the tank i ordered. my tank was supposed to be carbon fiber wrapped and it wasn't. overall performance: very dissappointing.
1,lol,...wrong i have a pure energy 3000 psi carbon fiber wrapped tank like the one in the picture retard and there all over the place
1,BAD!,Pine is very bad for your pet. It can cause respiratory problems which make your pet very sick. Try Aspen wood shavings. Cedar is also a type of shavings that can cause respiratory problems as well.
3,Too small,We are using this for our chickens - the pieces are a bit too small for my liking - wouldn't order for chickens again - maybe ok for hamsters or bunnies.
5,Kaytee Pine Bedding,"Kaytee is an excellent pet brand, so of course it is good. It's the same stuff you would find in the pet section of your local store, but I don't drive, so I order online. I would recommend this, or any other Kaytee brand supply for your pet."
3,"Dry, but informative.","I saw the movie, and it performed its function well: it piqued my interest. But, of course, being a dramatization, it was not bound by little things like facts; it took the basic story, and made it as interesting and dramatic as possible.This caused me to develop an interest in the subject, and a curiosity as to what the actual truth of the story was, and this book served admirably to answer that question.If you're interested in an entertaining story that has drama, characterization, and closure, see the movie. But if you're interested in historical facts, and literal truth rather than symbolic truth, read this book."
2,Watch the movie instead!!,"Steven Spielberg's movie Amistad won high critical acclaim, my wife and I included, for its insightful and inspiring portrayal of a relatively minor yet bellwether event in our history. Because I wanted to learn more, I picked up Howard Jones' Mutiny on the Amistad from the remainder table of my local bookstore. I must say I was disappointed. Jones succeeded in saying in 215 academically-bloated pages what perhaps could be told in half the length. As a lawyer, I am interested in and readily follow legal arguments, which is most of what Jones endeavors to recount. Each time an argument is referred to, however, Jones restates it in full rather than assuming his reader had read the preceding chapter or has some attention span. This fills a book already made ponderous by academic style and language. This book reads like a PhD dissertation; if, in fact, it was, I'm sure Jones deserves his degree, but I'm not confident he should win readers outside the ivory tower."
2,"Informative, but far too long and very dry","Book has a lot of info presented in a sensible order but is obscenely dry and hard to read. Goes on for far too long, book could have been 1/3 the length and the same amount of information gotten across. No original thesis; it's just a compilation of data.If you are writing an IN DEPTH paper on the Amistad mutiny, you have found your book. For anything else, it's rubbish. You can get a better overview off Wikipedia."
5,Jones is very enlightening and amusing,I had a chance to meet Dr. Jones this past January and read his book. He teaches us in his superb telling of this story that sometimes Historians are couragous for telling parts of history the mainstream would rather forget.
3,too long!,The book was great in explaining everything but things were too repetitive. The point could have gotten across through a much shorter version
4,like it a lot but still can improvise,I frankly love the coat rack and have been enjoying it a lot for the past one month. We find it very conveneint to just put coats or our mufflers as we get them off since running to the closet and putting them in its appropriate place can be a pain when u come home late or tired. And it also helped me from having to pick after my husband when he throws things on the bed ...:)... so yeah but definetly the stability can be improved but adding weight atleast on the bottom but then again i got a great buy for what i paid..
3,Loved it then it broke:<,I loved it for a while until I put another jacket on it and it broke. So sad now:(
4,just what I expected,"works for the coats we wear daily, we don't overload this and I really liked the lower hooks. I think they are to hang umbrellas, but it works great so my kids can reach to hang their own coats. very easy to put together, everything screws together...love that the best"
4,Nice for Price,"This tree is nice for the price, if you are looking for a simple coat tree, easy to assemble, then this is perfect. It is also great for use with small children, not only does it have the lower hooks, perfect for kids to hang up their own coats, it also, won't break the budget, should it get knocked over and broke."
3,"ok, kind of cheap",Quality left some to be desired; we use it to hold items waiting to be ironed since it looks to cheap to keep in our hallway.
1,It breaks!,"Sure, it looks nice enough without anything on it. But if you plan to actually hang coats and umbrellas on it, pick something else. It's tippy and it doesn't hold very many coats without the pegs cracking and breaking off. It's cheap, but you're getting less than what you pay for. It couldn't last a winter when being used by only two people."
5,AMAZING,"I bought this as decoration and it has become a huge part of my living room. It is very durable and stable. My boyfriend and I hang everything from coats to dog leashes on it, my favorite use for it so far is my purse. It is truly amazing!"
3,Coat rack,"When received the coat rack was different from the picture and the description too. Was still a nice rack, but was expecting the one on te picture."
4,Just what we needed,"This is the second of these coat trees I've ordered, and they work perfectly in executive offices. VERY easily assembled. Color goes well with office furniture. I'm planning to order another one soon."
3,its ok,It's ok have it in y office and it hold coats and other thing people but on it so if this is what you are looking for then hit the pay key and have one sent to you
2,Cherry Coat Tree-Coat Hanger,"Serves its purpose. It's o.k. and will do. It was easy to put together, although it's flimsy, not sturdy at all.Unfortunately, the seller I chose to make this purchase from sent the item with a small part missing and for some reason the item had a terrible, very strong chemical odor. Decided to keep, after airing it out a few days before hanging anything on it."
2,"Useful, but doesn't quite make the grade","I used this book to go througth the game sucessfully, but it wasn't entirely accurrate, especially on the part where Booster and his buddies open the cutains- there's no specific one- it's totally random! Also it claims that ""ALL SECRETS"" are revealled, but I discovered several items that weren't listed at all. Because it was unauthorized, there was no way of checking whether all secrets really were revealled. Well they weren't. There was a VERY useful badge that I found that wasn't listed at all in the book. The purpose of a guide is defeated if it ignores certain info. I'd recommend an offical guide so there are guareneed to be no mistakes."
2,Waste of money,The quality of DVDs is very poor - I can't play them neither on my computer nor DVD player.Waste of money!
3,Interesting if you want to know a little more about the lady who brought Reiki to the west,"Not particularly helpful for learning more about Reiki however. If you are interested in becoming a serious practitioner, you don't need this book. If you want to be a master at Reiki and understand another piece of history regarding it, buy it."
5,WC,Great item gives insight into life and living. Was purchased for my spouse and I would recommend this easy reading book.
2,Battle Shock Video VHS,"I have been unable to play the VHS Video, as my video player has a problem, but this kind dealer sent a DVD of the movie too, and I was able to enjoy that.Much appreciated.It is an older movie and didnt play well on my DVD player, but it played better on my computer."
4,Arizona,"Good product, only fault is detent snaps for legs do not hold, and legs will open when not wanted."
3,This stool is good if you get up a lot,"I bought this stool to take to a convention where I expected to be standing in lines for a while. I was right about the lines, but wrong about the stool. After sitting for half an hour while in a stationary line before the convention opened, the stool began to become uncomfortable. The tops of the legs began to push at my backside, and the edges of the seat started to restrict blood flow to my legs.I don't know if maybe the height was wrong for me or what, but it's not a stool I intend to use if I'm not standing up periodically. For short term use though, the stool will work fine."
4,Works for what I need!,"I bought this chair to take to the park when going there with my grand daughter. I have a bad back and bad knees and just need to sit once in a while. It does great for this purpose, its lightweight and has a case for carrying. I would not want to sit in it all day but for short periods its fine. If you have the same issues as me - measure your favorite height chair and get that height."
1,Broke after one week of use,"For a $75 portable stool I purchased specifically for its claims of ruggedness and durability, the fact that it separated at the hinge and a leg will not retract -- this is NOT OK. I am returning after ONE WEEK OF USE. Not recommended. I'm not a big guy at 6foot9"" tall and 160pounds heavy. This is NOT OK, and also upsetting because I really did like its concept weight and formfactor, but it can't fulfill its purpose in my life of allowing me to sit on it and trust it anywhere as claimed.Pros:+Seating mesh very thick and stiff nylon material+Adds almost no weight to year outdoor gear packCons:-Paid too much $75 I must've lost my mind-Claimed durable but broke after first week?!Bottom Line:Returning product for refund."
3,Requires care to keep from falling over,"The Walkstool Comfort is light weight and very portable. However, it is not stable when set up and uncomfortable for men."
1,Junk-don't spend the money,"Used very few times. One of the leg tube inserts bent and cannot push the leg back into the tube insert to fold the chair for storage. To order a spare part (tube insert), you must send cash to Sweden (see [...]), no USA support."
1,Not worth your money or safety...,"Not worth your time if your a bigger person... I got this item today and took it out of the box. Looked very neat and the mesh seat was made very well. However, the aluminum tubing frame was way under size and it was real flimsy as I put well under the max weight on it, not to mention that it wasn't very nice on the jublies to boot!.. Any-who, I printed out my return label and am sending it right back as I feel the quality is not up to par with the $104.99 price tag(maybe $10.99). Too much flex in the structural tubing just seemed like it would break when you needed it the most. It seems like they might be the maker of some of the cheaper walmart chairs."
5,Great Product for Bad Backs,"I am 6'4"", and have had two back surgeries. I should have ordered the 30""/75cm model. Purchased it for a trip to Disneyland for the long lines. It worked great. If they ask what it is, tell them it is a tripod. Per their policy, a chair or stool is not allowed in, but a tripod is.The 45 minute Space Mountain line became 1 hour and 15 minutes, and this was a ""stay in the park saver""."
3,"Not the ""ultimate"" but good","74 years old, bad legs and on oxygen, I need something to sit on in places that require much walking. This stool seems pretty sturdy. It does leave me with a bit of a tippy feeling but hasn't thrown me off yet. Perhaps a shorter model would have been a better choice however. I have not figured out how to hang this on my belt while walking as advertised? The bag it folds into needs a belt loop sewen to it. All it has is a long skinny drawstring.As soon as I get a good walk with it I will write more. It's not something I would have bought had I saw and handled it prior to purchase. On the other hand it is hard to build something as sturdy as I need and still make it compact and light to carry! It may be just the ticket once I sew a belt loop on it."
5,Great Chair!,I bought this chair for my husband's birthday and he loved it. We keep it on the motorcycle for times when we stop for a rest or the park for concerts. I like his better than mine - may buy another!
2,Bemani_man is the idiot,"First of all this wasn't a demo CD. It was Slipknot's first release and it blew ass. The lead singer has the same talent as Corey's pinky finger. Why do you think that they added Corey and other members? Because this garbage bombed. I am a huge knot fan and i understand that this cd is the history that lead to slipknot being what it is today. But that doesn't mean that it is a good cd. If you think ""different"" is what makes a cd then you are a tard. Talent and musical skill make a cd and it is nowhere to be found on this incoherent garbage."
2,Plain Bad,IM LIKE THE ONE OF THE BIGGEST SLIPKNOT FAN EVER..BUT THIS SLIPKNOT CD IS A WASTE...LET ME TELL YOU WHY...ONLY 2 MEMBERS FROM THE REAL SLIPKNOT IS ON HERE..SO DONT GET IT JUS BURN IT
1,Not as Expected,The information about the item being sold is incorrect. The paragraph does not specify that the cd is a BURNT cd. It is not the original cd. It also took over 2 weeks for me to recieve my cd. Even after paying for express shipping. I was not at all satisfyed with this purchase.
2,OK I'm here to set the record,"Ok biggest fans ever. No disrespect to real maggots. No this is not real. You can get a copy for about $250 online on ebay. The Original MFKR CD only has 9 songs.1 - Slipknot2 - Gently3 - Do Nothing/Bitchslap4 - Only One5 - Tattered & Torn6 - Confessions7 - Some Feel8 - Killers Are Quiet9 - Dogfish Rising (Hidden Track)A self-released album made by 5 members of the current Slipknot along with 2 other members that left soon after it's release in June 13, 1997. Mate Feed Kill Repeat had a limited print run of 2000 and is now out of print.To tell you the truth, I think you should buy it. Oh you can't unless you travel in time.A quick note to the people who say they are hugh fans. Make sure you know what you are talking about before you print it on here. Thanks So Much."
2,BETTER WITH COREY,"this disc is out of print. and has been for some time. this album or e.p. sounds un-slipknotlike. they just aren't the same without corey. p.s. its a studio release,not live."
1,Not what i exepted,I was expecting a fake copy of M.F.K.R because the real CD or album is $300-$600 but instead i recieved a item with not even the same cover art it actually has there vol.3 mask and live songs on it.Im very disapointed if you want a fake M.F.K.R cd go to Ebay there better discriptive.
4,Good premiere episode...score: 75 (out of 100).,"The Reluctant Stowaway is my favorite episode of the entire Lost In Space (LIS) saga. Actually, the two primary characters that steal this episode are Dr. Smith and the robot.Plot: Evil government agent, Dr. Zachary Smith (Jonathan Harris in his best role of the entire series), plans to sabotage space ship that carries Earth's first family into orbit for colonization. All in all, this episode of LIS could have survived as a story on The Outer Limits or The Twilight Zone, but CBS insisted that the series undergo three dreadful years.Pros: Jonathan Harris, robot, special effects (for its time)Cons: Characters, storyOverall score: 75 (out of 100)"
5,Great tool brand,"Finally decided to start my own basic tool collection, and spent hours researching the best value brand that would last a lifetime. Everything in the Irwin series of tools is high quality and affordable, and is more than capable of doing whatever needs to be done for an apartment dweller like me. I got the 6 in. version, and it has come in very handy."
4,KJV/Amplified Parellel Bible,It was everything I expected but changed my mind and decided to switch of another kind of Bible. It came timely and the large print was great.
5,best purchase I ever made,this book has changed my life I now have a deeper understanding of God's word and can apply it to my life more diligently
4,Great seller!,"Great seller! Bible arrived new in the box. Shipping was fast. I was surprised that the ""large print"" was not as large as I had expected. Slightly disappointed with the size of the print. I did keep it and am using it."
3,My package,Even thou it came on time the front cover could of been better. The front cover is to small for the book but other than that the bibe is fine thank you anyway lol.
4,FANTASTIC Bible!,"I ABSOLUTELY love this bible! This is the second one that I've bought from Amazon.com. The only problem I noticed with this bible is that the book cover is approximately 1/4 inch shorter that the bible. With this error, it doesn't cover the bible in it's entirety. Other than that, of course the pages are a little thin, however, if you're careful, this will not pose a problem."
3,Large Print version still has very small print.,"I love the idea of parallel Bibles, especially when I saw the KJV and the Amplified, my two favorite translations together.I orderd the ""Large Print"" version, but was shocked that it is the same size print as my other regular print Bibles. It is not large at all - in fact the print is tiny, and it is light grey, not black. I have a large-print Amplified Bible that is really large print and easy to read.I rechecked, and the Bible does say ""Large Print"" on the cover and on the inside, so unless this Bible is defective, what they call the ""Large Print"" version is not really large print at all. I thought that this might be useful for people to know."
4,Larger Print,I love the Amplified Parallel Bible. Now I only have to carry one Bible instead of two. At my church we use both the KJV and the Amplified. I would like the print to be larger. I am a Senior and it is not easy for me to read small print. I thought the print would be larger.
2,disappointed,Not for someone that truely needs large print it is really only normal size - pages tissue-paper thin and most 'stuck' together.
2,not what I expected,"waited to order this bible hoping it would aide me in my studies, but the print isn't large even though it claims' to be large print, and this bible doesn't give the header notes every other bible gives for the price you expect to be ahead of the cheaper bibles just don't brother"
3,Annabell from SC,"I like my parallel Bible, would like it more if it was a larger print. It says large print on the bible, but it looks like small print. If you want large print then you need to look for Giant Print. I don't think they sell Giant Print at least I haven't seen it."
4,Good Bible.,The reason why I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is not the Big Print Bible that they advertised. Otherwise this is a good bible.
5,"KJV/Amplified Parallel Bible, Large Print (King James Version)","The KJV/Amp Bible is a great bible, that gives better understanding through the parallel Bible verses."
5,kjv/amplified parallel bible,"I have always wanted one. Easy to use, I highly recommend useingit, if you are a student of the bible. Side by side is wonderful. Its like having two bibles in one."
4,KJV/Amp Parallel Bible,"I bought this for my sister, as I, too, have a Parallel Bible. This version allows the reader to read the original English translation so as not to miss out on as much as can be with newer translations; yet, gives very good definitions, in an easy-to-read format of the Amplified. Both, together, written side-by-side, allows much information to be digested easily.Unfortunately, the cover cannot be engraved upon...bummer"
4,KJV/AMP Holy Bible,"I like the Bible, some other features would be nice, like thumb reference,and some commentary but I understand it is a large Bible and much of what I would like to see would make it much more expensive. I am very satisfied with the purchase. Thank You"
5,Very Much Satisfied!!,I am satisfied with this purchase! It makes my sermon preparation & delivering sooo much easier!! Even with my studying it greatly helps that the scriptures are side by side!It's very much worth purchasing if you want an AMP/KJV Parallel Bible.The things that I was NOT satisfied about with this bible is it does not have a presentation page to put your name on so I suggest having your name engraved on it if ever you'll need proof of ownership. It doesn't have a dictionary that gives a definition of the words. And the pages are REALLY THIN so you have to be careful when you turn the page.If you have trouble reading small print and need what the call large print...I think you'd find difficulty with this font size.
1,amplified bible,I was disappointed with the product I order the box said large print and when u open the bible the print is small
5,What shade of yellow,Can anyone tell me if this softee baby yellow is the old yellow or the new very pale yellow (which I don't like). Thanks.
4,Easy To Use!,"As a new-comer to the world of woodworking, this was the 1st time I have ever used edge banding. I was surprised at how easy this went on with just a regular iron. I set the iron on high and proceeded to get great results. The price for 250 feet was also great compared to places like Woodcraft. I am very happy with this product. If you get it, I recommend getting the edge cutter as well. I tried using a box cutter but got bad results."
1,Don't buy it!,"I've wasted many hours trying to install and use the RAID features. I contacted SIIG for support and setup a ""trouble ticket"" that has never been responded to. I also called and got the run around from support.I asked them a simple question: ""If this card doesn't work with my HP Pavilion or my Compaq Presario, what system DOES it work with?"". Guess what: no reply. I strongly advise you look else where, perhaps an Adaptec RAID controller or other name brand."
1,Could not get card to work on 2 computers.,"This card has promise & it is a good idea.I did my homework and checked their web site to read the manual online. I looked, but couldn't find a review on the SIIG product.The problem... I could not get it to see the 2 120GB Maxtor drives in a Dell Dimension 4400 with Windows XP.I tried it in an HP Pavilion 750n with 2 80GB drives, and it could see the drives, build the mirror, but not boot to Windows XP.Checked the web site for help, no good. Called tech support, not any help except to say that they have some ""BIOS issues"". That was the end of it. Returned it to Amazon, and I am going to try Adaptec's card. Unfortunately it is not a combo card like this one.Bottom line... SIIG had little help in the manual, on the web site, and on the phone."
5,love it,i just love having this in my truck. only got one cause thats all that was available at the time.need to get one more. i love tinkerbell
4,The Silver Branch,"Want a riveting historical-fiction novel with a plot that is better than most? If so, the Silver Branch is a book for you. Set in Roman Britan, over a century after the first book in the series, The Eagle of the Ninth, the book paints a picture of the life of two Romans, who seek to overthrow a tyrannical emperor who has separated himself, and Britan, from Rome. Rosemary Sutcliff has indeed woven a story whose plot is exceedingly diverse and well thought-out. The book gives the reader a gripping plot in which the reader is given a picture of the Roman world. The book paints a vivid picture of a Roman town, Legion, a gladiator fight, and the Roman's enemies the Saxon barbarians. Rosemary Sutcliff has the gift of being able to write very good historical novels."
2,The Silver Branch,Difficult read. Purchased it for summer read for my 11 year old but it was a struggle for him to understand it.
1,Confusing! I'm Sorry but I DEFINATELY did not like this book,"This book was extremely incomprehensable!!!It was BORING and it kept bringing new characters in without introducing them or anything.I'm not a stupid person and I'm not to young to read this ""hard"" book,but it simply was a bad book!!!"
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Sutcliff has written another piece of historical fiction set in ancientRoman times. This is not in the same time period as The Eagle of theNinth though, but considerably later.Here, two young men plot to overthrow an emperor of the not very nice sort."
4,The Periodic Table.,"It's an emblematic title for a book designed whit tales that confection a whole history. The book is a metaphor of the periodic table: elements conform substance so words conform ideas.Primo Levi is a mentor; he begins a melancholic tale, connecting us with characters and at less expected time we receive a little lesson about chemistry, -it's a good way to spread science, didn't it?- but that's not enough for him so we also get his testimony about how he suffered WWII.Primo's statement is hard: ""... I felt guilty at being man, because man had built Auschwitz..."" at last it's not clear if he got peace at his mind; but, I must recognize he is honest, because somewhere in the book he says that Primo Levi writes for Primo Levi.In conclusion, it's a gentle book wrote to present a testimony of a man who was born Jewish in Italy, studied chemistry and suffered the war."
5,good chemistry!,"I didn't know what to expect when picking up this book. I'd recently finished the not unrelated Garden of the Finzi-Continis and thought I might find some variant on this. Yes, both books consider Jewish-Italian culture in the years surrounding WWII, with the specter of the holocaust in the background (mainly). But they are quite different. F.C. has at its roots the humanities, and P.T., the sciences. And what I most enjoyed about P.T. was the chemistry. It's a rarity in literature to find a subtle appreciation for the career of the scientist, and Levi succeeds admirably. This book would be an outstanding choice for any science and engineering student to read just to see how one can ply a trade, be it in the laboratory, the mine, or the consulting business. Bravo, Dr. Levi."
5,Entertaining,"""You got a new book? What is it?"" my roommate asked.""It's called 'The Periodic Table,' by Primo Levi. He was an Italian Jew who went through Auschwitz."" I had just gotten the book in the mail; that was all I knew about it.Later, she interrupted my reading. ""You keep laughing. That book is supposed to be funny?""I knew why she was surprised. Levi led a serious, sometimes troubled life, but ""The Periodic Table"" isn't limited to seriousness. It's fascinating and often funny to read his stories about his early obsession with matter (and the trouble it caused), his fiction inspired by alchemists and elements, and his anecdotes from a professional double life as a chemist and writer."
3,Somber and charming by turns,"An odd-ball blend of autobiography and short fictions, organized around a motif that would be almost cute if Levi didn't approach everything in his life with somber, intelligent reflection. As odd as it sounds, this is exactly the sort of writing I would expect from a life-long chemist. Even when he waxes heavy on entomological minutia, (something which I think he gets from his fellow Italian, Vico), this is all clearly the product of a highly analytical mind. He barely touches on what happened to him in Auschwitz here, but you can feel the weight of it pressing down almost constantly. The old world haunts, as ever."
2,A BIG LET DOWN;,"Gena a twentieth computer analyst is hurl back to the year 792 into Dominick's bed.There was no battle of wills between the hero and heroine.I was surprise when Gena first encounter bronze age Dominick they greeted each other like they were long times friends. No sparks, No battle of wills. King Charles and Queen Fastrada had more character in this romance than the main characters.A BIG LET DOWN! This was the second Flora Speer's book I have read. Both romances made me cross eyed."
2,Not What I expected,"The heroine goes into an office to correct a computer for Y2K and by typing the wrong date she's transported to the hero's time. They get caught up in a plot to overthrow the king. I didn't find the characters special or the ""plot"" interesting reading."
4,"Fascinating, thorough treatment","I was looking for a book that explained how we got to a 12-tone scale, mostly, world-wide. I'm not sure that question was answered, but it contains a wealth of information, with solid theory, on elements of the musical scale that we take for granted."
4,Another Perspective,This is not the traditional take on the Alamo. It shows the role of Mexican Texans (Tejanos) who also fought for independence from Mexico. Then it highlights that these former brothers in the fight were later seen as enemies and their land taken from them. Well done and interesting. I have shown it to 11th and 12th graders and got a very positive response.
5,A Must Have For Every CD Collection,Tommy Shaw has once again proven far and above anything else his talent as a singer and a songwriter with this CD. The music is timeless and diverse. I would recommend this CD for everyones collection..One will not be disappointed in any of the selections on it..
1,Awful!,"Wow. This is bad. Really bad. After listening to this and that joke of a STYX album (Brave New World - which Tommy took over most of the production away from Dennis), I've come to the realization that this guy needs to realize that just because an CD can hold a lot of songs, doesn't mean you have to use up all of the space. Sometimes fewer is better..."
3,Ted Nugent Again!,"You might think this album is great. You might think this album is rubbish. You know what? You need it. Ted Nugent plays on it, that's why."
2,Disapointing Shaw album,"Im a Tommy shaw fan, but i must say this album kinda sucks. ""A place to call my own"" and ""stop knockin"" are good, but the rest are pretty lame. If you want to hear good work by Tommy, get Girls with Guns or What If. Both albums are far superior."
1,Could this be any worse!,"We all have our moments when we will experiment with anything just to see what happens, but when you put it out to the public, it better be right! This is a lesson that Tommy Shaw still hasn't learned! What a hodge-podge, muddy sounding mess! I have no idea what Shaw was trying to do here, but then it appears that it was a mystery to Shaw himself. It sounds rushed and thrown together. Shaw should have taken more time to figure out what he was looking for in this experiment. If this CD was a chemistry lab, it would be a smoking pile of rubble!"
5,One of Tommy Shaw's best!,"I'm a big Tommy Shaw fan, and this is probably one of my favorites of his albums. The songs are great, the music is great - it's just a fun album to listen to!"
4,THIS VIDEO HELPED US...,"We were looking for something to do that was not ""sex"" but somehow connected to sex. Tantra Tai Chi gave us a way to back off from the pressures of sex while still keeping the possibilities open. This video helped us. We've gotten back on track with each other."
4,Crossing Delancey,Delightful... Sweet. Silly. Good movie regarding the Jewish mannerisms. Ends with a twist. Peter and Amy are a good combination. Amy's grandmother pulls the the story together with her witticism.
5,A nostalgic romance set in downtown New York City,"Amy Irving shines in this nostalgic romance of a tres chic,hip together downtown Manhattan lady whose grandmother hires a marriage broker in her traditional Jewish Community in different part of Manhattan to find her ""a kind husband with a good business and nice home"". Isabella still revels in her life as manager of a trendy bookstore who spends a lot of her time at work schmoozing local authors to give readings in her shop as their newe novels go on sale. Reizl Boyzik is her grandmother. The men in her life include Jeroen Krabbe, Peter Riegert and John Bedford Lloyd. A gem of a nostalgic downtown New York City romance!"
4,"Ranks with Sleepless in..., When Harry met... and While you","I have seen this movie a few times. And it is a jewel I need to have for my video library for those inclimate days. If you liked Sleepless in Seattle, When Harry met Sally or While you were sleeping, then this movie will be just for you. It teaches the value of friends, love and good and bad timing for relationships."
3,Sweet flick - but duped,"A sweet romance, nice multi-generational touch, great clash of micro-worlds. The duped part is advertising David Hyde Pierce as starring when he only has a bit part. Shame."
5,"In a word, *GREAT*","Positively one of the best romantic comedies made... ever. Long, long, long overdue to be released on DVD!"
4,Charming,"A charming, unpretentious little gem, which is even better if you know New York City. Don't expect the comedic heights of classics like Bringing Up Baby or Adam's Rib, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Fun soundtrack. Just enjoy."
5,Great movie - Crossing Delancey,I haven't seen this movie in years and I totally enjoyed seeing it again. Love Amy Irving and she doesn't disappoint in this movie.
4,"Sweet, funny comedy!!",This a classic that went under the radar. The characters are relatable to any Jewish family. Amy Irving is adorable and her Yiddisha grandmother steals the show.
5,Enjoyable Romantic Comedy,I have enjoyed this movie everytime I have watched it. Getting relationships right takes a lot of work. This movie touches this in an amusing way. Jerry
3,Still a great movie.,"I ordered this movie because I remembered it being such a feel-good, nice story movie. And it still is. It is an older one so the clothing is a little outdated, but still an enjoy able movie."
2,Disappointing ending,Movie seemed to have a plot that was enjoyable but it just ended leaving us with the feeling that we missed something.
2,2 star,Had to give it 2 stars because I had to fast forward the second half. Just didn't have the patience. But had some interesting parts.
5,Crossing Delancey,"The quality of the DVD is excellent, as was the price. I have always loved this movie, and marvel on how the casting types got it so right...A sweet, romantic, lovely film, so removed from the profane laden, violent, and nudity of the products currently favored by Hollywood. ""Box Office"" for the most part, is the name of the game. So sad! I have watched this movie many times, and it is rarely on TV now, so decided that I wanted to be able to enjoy whenever the mood hit. A feel good movie, for sure. Two of my friends have already borrowed it. I was pleasantly surprised to find it on Amazon, and it arrived within a few days. I now live in New Mexico (what?) but am a native New Yorker and love to see films that were set in NYC. Takes me back to when I walked those streets. :) Wonderful on all levels...Amazon ""rocks""!"
5,A classic!,I have had this movie for years! I let someone borrow it. She didn't give it back. I had to have it. I have watched this a 'gazillion' times and still love the story and the moral of it. A great story with a powerful lesson!
5,Where is the DVD,"Tap, tap, tap.. ok now,..... Where is the DVD???????????? Enough already. I could have a heart attack waiting so long.. It is not a good thing to keep the buhbie waiting for the DVD... Love this movie.. Five Stars.. I wonder if there will be clips and deleted scenes.. interviews and other little herrings added in. It's a lovely thing you know, this movie, yes a lovely thing. The red herring and the schnapps were delightful and the wedding ahhh what can I say, delightful."
4,great chick flick if your looking for one,"Good story, some what funning chick flick. Have to understand the jewish life / hummer a bit to enjoy it"
5,At long last!,"Finally, one of the funniest, most charming and intelligent romantic comedies ever written and filmed is on DVD. What the heck took them so long?"
4,Good introduction to SIP,"I found this book very helpful, descriptive and a very good introduction to SIP and it's services."
4,here is the collected good info on SIP,"our new shinning star SIP in IP Telephony , book is nearly perfect to demonstrate the capabilities of SIP , good to follow inlink RFCs ."
4,Well worth the read,Very interesting approach to SIP had a lot of good information about what the future may bring
3,Best beads for this age group,"These beads are nice and big and chunky and the string and ""needle"" are easy to grasp. The colors and animal patterns are great for learning colors and animals. I think this is a solid toy for 18 month to 3 year old kids."
2,Mad Mary Workbook,This was not worth purchasing as it added very little beyond what was already included in the questions at the end of each chapter. It was mostly a rehash of the end of chapter questions or a variation of them.
3,Helpful but it's all on 5min.com,"I wasnt able to see the back of this DVD before I bought it, but it's okay I will keep it. This entire DVD is on youtube in sections by categories, and the dance routine is on 5min.com I used the routine last year for my tackle cheer squad's end of season performance. Stretches and motions are very helpful though it is a good beginner DVD but why buy it when you can see it for free??? lol"
3,Just another compilation,"Nana is the world's greatest singer in my opinion. However, it merely consists of songs extracted from previously released CD albums. A total waste of money if you already have these CDs. They didn't even bother including any songs NOT released on CD. Nana has come out with better German compilations than this. Why do we even need to have such an ungodly number of compilation CDs? Why is there still no German box set? Why do they keep recycling the same songs over and over? This is, nevertheless, a good CD if you only have a minor interest in Nana's German repertoire."
5,"Maybel, drop the dishes, get in here, you gotta hear this!","From the first track to the last, this album rocks with pure, raw, uncontaminated rock and roll. No presevatives or fillers here. 100% All natural rock and roll music. Raw guitar sounds with incredibly soul-felt yet simple riffs. Great vocals with harmonious melodies and underlying tones. Heavy, intricate, solid and tight are just a few words that can describe the rhythm section behind Injected's music. This is music for music's sake. Good songs undiluted by popular culture. Its all about good songs, well written, well arranged and unspoiled by over production. Rock and roll music left raw, natural and pure just as it was inteded. Dirty guitar sounds accompanied by incredibly catchy melodic vocals, glued together with heavy grooving drum and bass. What more could you want? One listen and you will know, these guys are going places."
5,Incredible.,"Wow, I've never heard of these guys at all until I listened to one of their songs on one of Direct TV's Music channels. I liked the song so much, I wrote it down, and went to Amazon to see reviews on the album. They all seem impressed, so I bought the album, and was treated to an original, great-sounding experience! For a debut almbum, this is pretty damn good. I don't listen to much alt. rock, but this was worth it. It even had guitar solos in some songs, which is a bit rare nowadays. BUY THEIR ALBUM AND SUPPORT THEM! THEY DESERVE IT."
5,This is an awesome album!!,"this album is ablsolutly pure genius. The aren't good enough words to describe it, so on that note, it should be 10 out of 5 stars!!"
5,excellent stuff here,"i bought this cd on a whim and it is one of the best rock cd's i own. these guys are very talented and they dont BS you. its all rock, not ""nu-metal"" or ""rap-rock"". these guys could have played in the 80's and been right at home. dont be frightened by my last statement. they arent motley crue or poison. they are heavy modern rock that have a ton of tallent and a ton of great songs. injected is one of those bands that knows a great sound and doesnt try to experiment with it. they are straight forward with the delivery of every tune. the guitar work on this record it top notch. the vocals sound different on some songs but are excellent. the drummer is very gifted. i cant reccomend this record enough."
1,"Terrible, not helpful one bit.","I studied for weeks using this book and the companion book by Martini. When the time came to take my Excelsior Exam, I failed it. The multiple choice questions here are designed to make you believe you'll do o.k. when you take the actual test. I went into the exam feeling confident and knew within no time that I had been misled! The Excelsior test itself is 10X more difficult and focuses primarily on cytology and histology. This is a lousy study guide if you're taking the Excelsior exam."
3,Sort of Sucks,"Many of the review answers to the questions are just PLAIN wrong in comparison to the book that Martini wrote. It is great to have, but it may be a waste of money considering that you will be tested on material that may be incorrect according to this manual."
4,Book purchase,"e-mailed questions concerning description prior to purchased, all were answered & addressed. This book was as it was described & delivered rapidly."
4,good quality,"I received my Cd in a timely manner. The CD case was intact, the CD had minor-to-no scratches. Would purchase from this vendor again. Have no complaints."
5,Eve-Olution,"This album is hot. I never was able to listen to any one of Eve's albums without skipping 1 or 2 tracks but this one, i cud jus let it roll str8 thru. Id recommend it to whoever just lookin for something good."
3,great.,"well first of all i luv eve. how she runs through her songs real fast. and how it sounds liek ehs not trying at all. like its jus gliding right through. her songs are soo ""danceable"". its really grea.t gangsta lovin' ft. alicia keys is awesome. other sogns are great too. Eves older cds are great too. talk about hottness too!!!!!!!"
2,I expected more,"In short,the only material on here worth a listen are the singles.Other than that, this album follows the usual hip hop/rap pattern.Meaningless rhymes,playa anthems,and filler,filler,filler.I expected way more from Eve. But don't be fooled by the singles. The rest of the album can't possibly live up to them."
1,Pop Album or Rap Album... Either way it ...,"Luckily I heard this album off of a streaming web site, and I nearly fell asleep. The first track ""What"" with Face Hurts is really well done, trippy beat, and Eve provides some decent lyrics. Gangsta Lovin is the radio smash of the summer, that doesn't mean its good. Irresstable Chick and Party in the Rain sound like something Jessica Simpson would do, and it comes off very bad on Eves part, the chrous' are catch however. Basically, this album falls after number 3, and it falls hard to the floor. Eves lyricism is extremley boring, and she is not saying much behind these nice beats. If you were smart, you would wait for November when Foxy Brown drops 'The Fever' on everyone."
4,Eve is ill! Yet again!,"As I listen to this CD, I'm feeling it more and more. I admit, Eve's first two efforts were better than this...but not by much. Eve is still one of the illest female lyricists and she will have that title for a long time. I'm glad DMX kept her on and she wasn't kicked off like other female MC's whose albums flop (Jay-Z got rid of Amil after her first album flopped ""All Money is Legal"" and some other female MC's as well who we haven't heard from like Mia X, etc. etc). This album has nice lyrics and never ceases with the ill beats."
5,Homemade Dolls in Foreign Dress,"I found this book to be helpful for use with the AMERICAN COSTUME DOLLS:HOW TO MAKE AND DRESS THEM book, also by Nina R. Jordan, because it introduced a new type of dollmaking, without paper and paste but with fabric and wires, so they can pe posed after they are finished. I personally liked this because I can't really make the paper-and-paste dolls that well, they get too confusing. It also introduces new types of costuming and, like the AMERICAN COSTUME DOLLS book, describes and gives brief patterns for the costumes. Instead of having the costume designs for American time periods, HOMEMADE DOLLS IN FOREIGN DRESS has costumes for foreign countries."
5,Excellent series,I have all five of these books and I only wish there were more. The authors are truly imaginative and the stories are sheer pleasure. I'd love to find more books like this.
1,not for outdoor use.....one dead on arrival,"ordered a twin pack. Arrived in a small brown box with two small tags on it indicate ""Indoor/Outdoor Light Timer"". However, it's clearly stated in the first line on operation guide that it's ""Indoor use only"". It's also stated to be applicable 0C~55C (32F~131F) so I can't use it to control the Christmas decoration in my front yard at all!More than that, I found 1 of the 2 timers are actually dead out of box!If you want to feel safe and ease while your Christmas decoration is controlled by a timer, go get better one."
2,Not for outdoor use and not digital.,"Advertised as a set of heavy-duty indoor/outdoor timers, instruction number one states the timer is for indoor use only. There is a strong warning about getting the product wet. The product is manual not digital. It uses tabs you flip up to set. It says it may be used with a 10 or 15 amp outlet. It will accept a three-pronged plug. I just got it, so I can't comment on how well they work."
1,piece of trash,"piece of trash. Don't buy them.1. the title says 'indoor/outdoor', but the included manual says 'indoor only'2. it is very loud3. after one month, one of them stopped working. after 3 months, the other one died as wellInstead, go to walmart and buy BRINK timers. They have high quality mechanical type timers for less than $7 that has grounded plug, LED on/off indicator, and 15 min on/off adjustments."
3,"work great, but are noisy","timers work great but you can hear them running from across the room, and can be a little confusing to set."
2,Perhaps the weakest of the series,"I've read all of the Lee Harris ""holiday themed"" mysteries, and this one is the weakest of the lot! While an interesting vacation tale (Christine as tourist), her constant self-denial begins to wear thin. Must it be mentioned in nearly every chapter? And as a ""guide"" to the Holy Land, stick to travel writers who will do a better job of the historic/political aspects of this part of the world."
2,Stay in the U.S!,"I've read every one of the excellent books in this series and always look forward to the next...this one, however, was disappointing. Starting with a far-fetched reason for Jack to be in Israel, and building on that shaky foundation, this was not up to the author's usual standards. Next time, let's stay home!"
2,Not what I expected...,"Given that this was No Doubt's first album, I will cut them some slack. I know that they were more into ska when they started out, and that is obvious on this album. Most of the songs are corny and juvenile (I'm not gonna be mean and say they were downright ""stupid""), but there are still great vocals (props Gwen), guitar riffs (Tom), bass parts (Tony), and a steady drum beat (Adrian). I also notice the keyboard parts Eric contributed to this sound. But this CD is so much different from how they were in '95, or now. I didn't like any of the songs, really, but since they were young and inexperienced in the music biz, I will not rate them too critically. (Note that the only reason I said these things are because I prefer their rock sound to their ska sound...I don't like ska.)In conclusion, it is clear TO ME why this album did not sell too well. (Don't worry, I still love you NxD!)"
1,This Is What Launched Their Career?,"I was expecting something way different from this. I loved Tragic Kingdom, but this, no way. The type of music and sound is totally different. There's no rock! And the lyrics are really stupid(like on track 2). I do not recommend this CD. Specialy if you are a fan of Tragic Kingdom."
1,ungh,"Nothing GoodOwning this cd is bad for youDumb songwritingOfficially the worst cd everUnofficially bad tooBoring, Juvenile lyricsTragic Kingdom is 1000 times betterMy sister loves this garbage, a self proclaimed number one fan, but what does she know."
5,This is GREAT!!!,"even though i have owned this album for almost a year. i whished to expand my collection of ND cd's so i brought this one.this is one of the best ones they have, its simply great!"
2,"Ok, But....","I bought this CD after loving Tragic Kingdom. A BIG Mistake. Every single song sounds the same, i don't know which is which! CD's I would reccommed is A boy Named Goo, (Goo Goo Dolls) Dizzy up the Girl, (goo goo dolls) and Tragic Kindom (No Doubt)"
3,"It kills me to do this, but...","I can't give this CD more than 3 stars. I'm a huge fan of No Doubt, I have most of their CD's but I didn't own their first CD. So yesterday, I bought it at Fred Meyer's for ten bucks. I wouldn't have payed more for it. You know, you would have to cut ND some slack because it was only their first album. I noticed that some of the songs sounded the same and would blend into each song, so it was like it was one long song. Bottom Line: Diehard fans of No Doubt(like me) should buy it, but don't expect much. If your'e not sure, buy Tragic Kingdom or beyond that."
4,This is where it all started for No Doubt.,"This album isn't as good as the rest of No Doubt's albums, but it is still awesome. No Doubt has kept a lot of the same sound from this debut CD. This one is also very ska, even more so than the others I think. All of the songs on the album are very happy and up lifting. They make you want to smile and get up and dance. That's one of the great things about No Doubt, and I'm glad they kept that very same vibe going for so many years.If you liked this album, I recommend: Try the band Save Ferris, they sound very similar to No Doubt."
2,Dissapointing,I loved Tragic kingdom so i figured i'd like this. Big mistake. This is junk. 2 stars because it isn't the worst cd ever made.
3,Pretty good for No Doubt's first cd,"This cd is mainly cute pop songs with a lot of the trupet in the background music. This is not one of my favorite No Doubt's cds...but it was their first cd so I'll cut them a little slack. My favorite songs on this cd are Let's Get Back, Sad For Me(which is a really cute but weird song), Doormat(great song), Sometimes(probably my favorite song on the cd), Sinking, and Brand New Day. All in all this cd is pretty good. Some of the songs are funny...while other songs are a waste of cd space...but I have a feeling No Doubt tryed hard on this cd."
2,Worst No Doubt Album Ever,"No Doubt has really evolved over the many years they have been together. Unfortunately, this album came out before they put out great rock songs that I associate them with.This album is so annoying. Only tracks nine through twelve bear repeated listening. The rest sounds like torture used to drive criminal holdouts out of their homes and into the waiting arms of police officers. Gwen Stefani sounds like a manic hamster, and the band seems caught in a frantically spinning hamster wheel of polka music, with aging marimba players delightedly playing their horns.One song is about eating all kinds of food, with a nice belch at the end. Grow up.Instead of this album, I highly recommend, No Doubt, The Singles (1992 - 2003)."
2,The Ska Fan's Opinion,"I got the album thinking that it might be good, since No Doubt was a ""ska band"" back then. It is definitely their best album ever, but only because they play a better kind of music. Basically, this is just really weird ska. I just couldn't listen to it. If you're into second and third wave ska, definitely don't get this cd."
5,The best of No Doubt,"This is the best from No Doubt. I like this album betta than the their other ones. This is just true rock, really instrumental, cool!"
4,For No Doubt fans only,"Gwen Stefani has a wonderful voice that I could listen to all day. The songs I like best are ""Let's Get Back,"" ""Doormat,"" and ""Big City Train."" There's one song, ""Sinking,"" that sounds like a Cyndi Lauper song. There are a couple of corny songs, but you have to remember that this CD came out in 1992. If you're a No Doubt fan, you'll appreciate this CD. I like it even more than Tragic Kingdom."
1,Jimjams is a treatise on author confusion.,"Okay, the writing is uneven, diffusive, and dull. Green tries to be funny but ends up being stupid. The monsters are a miasma of bits and pieces of Lovefraftian-style critters, and their descriptions are really lousy. No one, not even the author, seems to know what the plot is or what motivates these critters, making this a lousy C Movie, like the kind that The Sci-Fi Channel puts out. Indeed, bad writing equals turgid plotting, dull characters, plus trivial dialogue -- which is the losing formula for many cheesy sci-fi horror B-flicks, as well as for this story.Conclusion: I'm only marginally relieved that I paid $2.02 for this book. That's because I still feel as if my $2.02 has been wasted. END"
1,Save your money,Mr. Leon should be embarrassed by this release. The cd sounds like it was mastered from the original tapes at a slower speed. I'd like my 15 dollars back.
2,Mellow musician,"He hardly kicks like a rock band; more like a Georgia mule. Like the other reviewer, the version I have is the 1999 Purple Pyramid release, which has 17 cuts listed but only contains 16. ""Alabama Jubilee"" isn't there, but ""2:17"" is, yet on this version, ""2:17"" is missing entirely. An okay show, but Live at the Olympia in Paris is much better."
1,Don't buy this bootleg,"Leon Redbone receives no money by the purchase of this CD. Regardless of the quality of the recording, leave it alone."
4,"Nice kicks, but not true to size","Please be advised that this particular style runs about a 1/2 size small. For example if you wear a size 9 and you'll need a size 9 1/2, especially if you're planning to wear sock with them. Otherwise, they're a great looking shoe and you can't beat the price."
2,I agree that the sizes run small,"These shoes would be very comfortable if they were sized correctly. They felt okay when I first put them on, but after walking about a mile, my toes curled up. It is usually easy to tell when a walking shoe is too small, but it wasn't with these shoes until I walked for a while."
3,"Great shoe, fit not right","I had a pair of these already and ordered another pair the very same size. The shoes I received were marked the same size, but turned out to actually be a full size smaller. I gave them away."
2,Cheap and does not have a good sound,These drums to not have a good sound to them. They also do not come with a Bongo stick. We are using they for decor only because they do not have any kind of sound except for bang bang bang. A box makes a better sound.
1,Cheap piece of junk,"I was shocked at how poorly made and cheap this ""bongo"" set was. It didn't make any musical sound when tapped on. It's just paper glued on cheap wooden cups. Definitely skip these, it's terrible."
4,sturdy heavy,"these are very pretty and sturdy. Our 10 month old finds them to be a bit heavy, but i think as he gets older he will enjoy them more. UPDATE: its been a year and we finally broke one of the top drum covers. I still think these are great - and we were pretty rough with them. I will probably use gaffers tape to fix the rip."
3,Drum gently,"I purchased these bongos for my 2 1/2 year old son for Christmas because he is fascinated with music. He loves to drum along with Quincy on the Little Einsteins but he has a heavy hand... he has already punched a hole through one side. Be forwarned to use a gentle touch or a light tapping from a toy drumstick, otherwise you will be searching for a way to repair the bongos like I am."
2,Not a great sound,"These bongos look really nice, but do not have a great sound. They do not ""pop"" with a bright happy bongo sound, but have a rather dull ""thud"" sound - pretty disappointing. I was hoping to get a really distinctive sound from this product. They are very heavy and small, too."
1,I concur with all the negative reviews.,"I really have to start paying more attention to these reviews. Every time I've received a substandard product, I find it reviewed as such later. This is not a bongo drum. I don't know what it is, but it's not that. The sound it makes is exactly like putting a piece of cardboard over a cylinder. Or an old coffee can. It's absolute rubbish. Bongo's have such a distinctive sound, they're musical; this is not. I returned this and bought Remo RHYTHM CLUB, Bongos, 5/6 Diameters, Rhythm Kids Graphics for just a few bucks more, and could not be happier."
2,Disappointed,"These drums were cheap and you get what you pay for. The drum skins were loose so they don't sound good at all. I bought them for a 3 year old and she doesn't seem to care so, eh."
1,Dont waste your money,My three old had both drum heads busted completely out in about 10 minutes. I almost sent the bongos back when I opened them because the drum heads seemed like think construction paper at best but my son saw me open them. Huge wast of money- they were unusable after the first very short use and my son was only using it with normal drumming hands- nothing crazy or extra forceful.
3,"An unusual and very practical approach, but not for everyone","This book takes an unusual approach that some people seem to like and others don't. The entire book is devoted to building a single Cocoa application, step by step. Each step builds on what has come before, so you really can't jump around in the book at all. And the book is entirely example-driven; there is very little text talking about higher-level concepts, principles and design. If you learn best by example, and you want to see a large, high-quality application in Cocoa built from the ground up, then this book might be very good for you. Others will probably find it frustrating."
3,works well but hard to put down,The protective film arrived quickly and covers well. Installation is really a two person job since it bunches up and sticks to itself pretty quickly.
3,A little hard to get started off the roll,I wish it were a lot easier to start the plastic film coming off the roll. That is why I gave it only 3 stars. Otherwise it works as advertised and is holding up well!
3,Not like tape,"This is just sticky enough to barely adhere to carpet... and it wont adhere to dirty/greasy carpet at all... though I doubt anything would... this works well when trying to cover up an area where pets have been urinating... thoroughly clean the area... let it dry...Completely... and apply to the affected area... use excess amount to protect as much as possible, and prevent future incidents... all the while train you pet to use the proper facilities... after one week of solitary confinement and constant babysitting... i was able to get my 17 year old cat back to the way it should be... just keep a constant vigilance and if the squatting happens... be firm... and don't yell... tell them no... and then move them to the proper area... or do what i did and keep them locked up like a kitten... and make them go in a certain area..."
1,not near what expected,"i bought this tank about 1 and 1/2 months ago and finally got a chance to play and was disappointed, but before that i received it and it was pure black and 70 ci instead of 68. when i took it to the field and filled it it didnt make it outside and to the field before it was out of air nd it was in my harness the whole time unattached to the remote line or the marker. luckily i had my spare tnk on me and used it all day, i will now have to fork out some cash to fix a brand new tank that never worked but [...] is too much to just pitch. SAVE YOUR MONEY"
5,Brilliant CD by Indian Bingo,I love this CD. I had the cassette back in 1989 during a transitional period which i have fond memories of and this music was always the backdrop.It's got some really good song in a Smiths flavor but in my opinion much better.Very pleased with this album.
4,"LIve, Previously Unreleased","A mix of entirely live previously unreleased Smallfish music. For the first time ever, recordings of concert songs. Plus, catchy-fish tunes that never made it into the Smallfish library.The serious bio:Evan Lefloch is from Tampa, Florida and has a degree in Commercial Music. His former career in Youth Ministry led him to start Smallfish in 1999. Half of the year, Evan resides in Orlando, Florida. The rest of the year, he hits the road, going all over the country to youth gatherings, day camps, lock-ins and any other place where he is called to share the love of God through music. With just a piano, Evan plays all types of music from your favorite camp songs to country to praise & worship and even rock-n-roll (and all that jazz)."
2,Berkeley's weakest,"As with all of Anthony Berkeley's works, this is a proper, straight-up whodunnit, the point of which is to set us a detection puzzle, not to elaborate a plausible plot, or to examine the psychology of any interesting or sympathetic characters. On those terms it is successful, but it has rather less charm than is usual with Berkeley, largely because (uncharacteristically), he chose to load this little book with a heavy dose of right wing imperialist apologetics. The result is that this a rather dated, and often a rather irritating novel."
5,A Captivating Look at our First Ladies,"I bought this book with its companion book, ""The Presidents of the United States of America"" and loved both of them. This gives a very interesting look into the lives of the past and current First Ladies, from childhood until death. There is a 2-page spread on each First Lady with a good sized portrait or photograph to accompany each one, almost all being in color. I was disappointed with the portrait chosen for Jackie Kennedy, which didn't do her justice, but all the rest are lovely. A very entertaining read for children or adults about the many wives, sisters, neices, and daughters of our presidents who resided as ""First Lady"" of the White House. I couldn't put it down!"
4,Little Known Facts,This slim volume gives brief biographies of all the wives and women who stood by Presidents and helped them in invaluable ways to have memorable Administrations.
4,For teachers and designers,"Excellent reference book for an overall view of urban design today, with an accurate portrait of contexts and conceptual dimensions of and for a practice in urban design. The graphic design with explanatory boxes is very didatic for teaching purposes."
4,great introduction to urban design,"I am a graduate student in planning and I had heard a lot about urban design but still had a ahrd time defining and describing it for myself-let alone someone else. I approached a professor who recommended this book and I found it really helpful. Good examples, lots of research from other urban designers, and I liked the way the book is divided into easy to grasp ""dimensions."""
2,bike got stolen anyway,a week after buying this lock my bike got stolen... again.:/now i'm not even going to bother being cheap about the lock and buying a kryptonite
3,sturdy lock,"As far as the lock goes, all seems well. Seems sturdy and secure enough, with a safe locking mechanism (nice touch that you can twist the silver ring to cover the keyhole). The mounting bracket is not ideal, though. Depending on the bike frame, it's not easy to place conveniently, and the hold isn't quite as firm as I'd like it to be, even after tightening. And you can't release it again to move it to a different position."
2,No place to mount the bracket,"I have checked out the instructions and tried all of the various suggest methods of places to mount the bracket and carry the lock. I have no place on my bicycle where there is any part that has enough spaced to mount the bracket and carry the lock. I finally just tossed the bracket and now carry the lock in my bicycle basket. Otherwise this lock would have been useless to me and would have gone back to the store. For reference, my bicycle is a GT Aerostream, womens, small."
2,Jammed from the very beginning,"I wasn't able to open the lock until I found this page of reviews and found out that I had to bang on the lock with my fist with the key turned. Every time I want to open it I have to do this, so I will probably return the lock for a refund."
1,Horrible,"I bought this in conjunction with a bigger chain lock as security for a moped, came to a total of about 115 dollars. BOTH stopped unlocking, and I ended up having to get a friend with a metal cutter to get my bike off of my front porch. I would not recommend these locks to anyone unless you want your bike stuck!"
4,bulldong bike lock,"works fine, still have my bike a month later. knocked off all the plastic junk with a hammer and screwdriver to make it smaller. Comes with a big fistfull of spare keys, which is great, if you're a flake like me. so far the bracket to attach it to the bike needs to be retightened once in a while, and it doesn't really clip the lock securely, but i mounted it so gravity does the work. Many people complain that the breaks, so be careful how you're going to hang the lock off the bike."
2,Poor build quality,"Not a good product. Three problems:1. The photo in the Amazon description is not accurate. The lock has bright yellow rubber endcaps on the straight, locking portion. Not OnGuard's fault.2. The mounting clamp/piece on the curved U-bar portion does not stay in place. It rotates. It cannot be tightened more than provided and therefore when the lock is in the holder the lock rotates. This is annoying when you are riding over bumps and the lock swings out of position.3. The lock mechanism does not work smoothly. The curved U-bar bar portion is difficult to separate from the straight locking portion. Often the key must be turned back and forth several times to release the curved bar portion. I should have read the other reviews, here is text for anyone else not reading like me: THIS LOCK WILL JAM!"
2,Didn't last at all,"I had this thing for about three months before it abruptly broke on me. It was working fine, and now the key won't turn in the lock. I pretty much babied this lock as it rode inside my backpack with me rather than on the frame, so this is pretty unsatisfactory quality."
1,disappointed,"It doesn't last as long as my older aloe vera lipsticks, only a little longer than regular lipstick. It also feels less moist. I need a little lip balm over it to keep my lips from feeling dry. I was really disappointed."
2,Not what I expected,"I was expecting from the name of this product for it to go on blue. It doesn't. I was very disappointed and hope that in the future, the company will make it more clear what to expect from the lipstick."
4,"Good book, nice narrator","I listen to a lot of ""books on tape."" Ellis Peters writes interesting mysteries. They are written for adults, but there isn't anything inappropriate for teens. The voice on this particular recording is nice and fits with my imagination of the story."
3,It's about the era,Seems more a semi believable love story. The color of the period however makes this a joy.
3,sizing biscuits,I'm looking for biscuits size R3 and can't seem to locate them as some of them pictured don't state a size. I can't use the bigger biscuits. Do you carry R3 biskets? If you do could you ID them on the web sight? Thanks Earl
5,I HAVE THE IS PRINTED MAR 1950 BETTER PAPER COVER THAT THE LISTING 1948,I HAVE THE IS PRINTED MAR 1950 BETTER PAPER COVER THAT THE LISTING 1948
2,Seems to cause acne!,"I really like the MyChelle cranberry cleanser and Pumpkin peel but I did no have much success with this serum. I have mild acne which seemed to worsen with this product. When I stopped using it and continued with the cleanser and peel, my skin cleared up nicely. However, I like MyChelle products and don't want to disuade others from using it, because it might work for certain types of acne."
2,Product not the same since it went vegan,"MyChelle changed the formulation of this product several years ago, removing the lactic acid (derived from milk, if I understand correctly), and the product has not been the same since. It used to be not the least bit sticky, and was highly effective. Now it is sticky almost to the point of being soapy, and is no longer effective for my acne-prone skin. I respect the effort to make this product completely vegan, but unfortunately, for me, it compromised the product."
3,Jury is out,"I purchased this product for my 16 year old son who struggles with acne. He has tried many of the products out there. Antibiotics worked best, but had undesirable side-effects for a distance runner. (I don't think they should be over-used anyway.) I read previous reviews that suggested this product smells unpleasant, but he actually likes the smell and I don't think it's bad...a little earthy perhaps. I am sure it is great for some people, but it has not been the exact right thing for him. Also, I'm not sure how the price for such a small amount is justified. We'll keep trying."
1,No improvement,"I've this product a month before I decided to review it - my skin isn't any better than when I started, possibly even worse. This doesn't soothe and calm any red skin. The bottle is tiny and you have to very frugle with the pump because every pump costs you 25 cents. All in all, about as effective as if they had just put water inside it. Unfortunate because I had held out hope for this. I'll order this one other time because sometimes things do take 2 months to really become effective. If the second bottle improves my skin, I'll remove this review. If not, I'll keep it up.Update: 3 months of use, never noticed a single improvement. In fact, the serum wound up making my skin feel perpetually tight and dry, causing it to be MORE red. Wonderful waste of money."
2,Change in Formula since I originally gave glowing review....,"THIS IS AN UPDATE 1/24/2011: Since my original review last year, Mychelle seems to have reformulated this serum. It now has a soapy, sticky feel to it that wasn't there before and leaves my skin feeling tight and dry afterward to the point of requiring moisturizer. I have yet to find a moisturizer that doesn't clog my pores or cause breakouts, so this defeats the purpose of the Clear Skin Serum. I will not purchase this again and have lowered my original star rating and deleted my stellar review. So sad.... the original formula was really, really fabulous. And the zit zapping quest resumes. Sigh."
3,Didn't work for me,"I really wanted to like this stuff - love the natural list of ingredients - but I can't see any difference in my skin at all. I used this in combination with the Mychelle Perfect C serum [as their website said they increase the efficacy of each other] but my skin is no clearer, smoother, my pores no smaller, see no fewer breakouts. I wish I could report different results!"
1,Sad to say this made me break out,"Sadly, this made me break out really bad :( Too bad, seemed like THE dream product for acne sufferers. I have moderate to severe acne that has calmed waaaay down since I started taking YAZ.. That is, until I used this serum. I will go back to using Juice Beauty Blemish Serum which doesn't exactly clear my face up, but does reduce redness on contact and definitely heals the pimples much quicker when used in conjunction with BP."
4,"Great product, questionable packaging","I just got my second bottle of this, and I was surprised to find a new style to the bottle and the pump! The pump seems to loosen from the glass bottle more easily than the previous one did, I am tightening that topper just about every other day. And I'm not pleased with this pump, it squirts the product out at a harder (faster?) velocity, so I lose a few drops due to scatter/bounce each time. It's harder to get a half-pump out in this way, too.I wouldn't be so concerned about losing a drop here or there except this stuff is expensive and worth every penny! As long as I'm consistent with it, it takes care of and even prevents those nasty hormonal jawline/neck breakouts. I wish I had known the change was going to occur, I would have happily held onto my old bottle and refilled as necessary.Prior to this, I would have happily given it five stars."
4,Works great with Vitamin C Serum and whole acne line,"I have been using Mychelle products since May because I needed to clear up my skin for my wedding and I was going to pay the price. I've always had problems with acne and nothing really worked, including Murad (even though it certainly helped). After about one month of using the whole acne/oily line from Mychelle (I got the sample pack for about $20), my face cleared up!!!!!!!!! Well I ran out of the small sample of vitamin C serum and I started to get some zits but not nearly as bad as before. Of course, the serum is expensive about $40 so I had to wait to buy it. Once, I did buy it, I noticed my skin started to clear up again and I haven't really had problems since. I think the vitamin C serum works so well with the rest of the products."
2,allergic to this product,I am very happy with the pumpkin peel and hydration serum so I really wanted to like this one. I have oily and sensitive skin. This product smells bad and made me break out around the chin area. I didn't use it long enough to tell whether or not it is good at controlling oil.
4,Works pretty well,"I use this product in conjunction with the Cranberry Cleanser, Fruit Enzyme Spray, Eye Brightener Cream, Perfect C Serum, and Grapefruit Lotion. I love it because it doesn't dry out my skin. It seems to work well, but it's definitely not magic - it takes time. I have seen a reduction in whiteheads and very large, blocked pores that hurt a lot. It's been the blemish product that has worked best for me. In the past I've tried Tea Tree Oil from The Body Shop, Burt's Bees blemish roll-on stick, and various drugstore products, none of which have worked well."
5,I love this stuff !,"This stuff is great. I've been using it now for 2 weeks and my acne I had for years is almost gone. I'm so glad I found this product and will stick with it for the rest of my life. If you are suffering from acne and sensitive skin like me, give this product a try. It's totally worth the money."
5,works great!,"This stuff works great! It does not smell so good though, guess it's because of the witch hazel, that's the main ingredient. But it works well to control oil. I use it at night and under my make up during the day. A little goes a long way :-)"
3,not sure if it does much,"This product smells amazing...kinda hippish, like patchouli. Unfortunately I don't think it does much. I put it on at night to help repair the skin and keep breakouts at bay but it didn't do much as far as clearing the skin. Smells good but doesn't do much else. Won't be repurchasing."
5,like this,My skin was doing better before using this product after I watched my diet but I do like this product. I think it helps prevent breakouts and my makeup seems to go on better when I put this on first. For me it's a keeper.
2,NO results for the money,not very impressive for the amount of money i paid for this lotion...just made my face a little red with no results.
5,Does the Trick,"I used this edge banding to cover the rough edges of the working materials, plywood. Works great and looks great. It is simple to apply and it accomplished the job."
1,Worthless,"Only plus is that they look good.The fit is mediocre. There is no stretch areas so fitting them is a pain and there are still areas that are either too tight or too loose. Getting them on the back of my front seats required cutting out pieces of the factory seats.They aren't waterproof at all. They might as well be made of terrycloth, they absorb liquid that well.After 1 year, I have multiple tears, including the back seats which see VERY little use.Buy the Wet Okole"
1,"Crude, Offensive Humor","I will admit that I am not familiar with Casper the Ghost, but I have a three-year-old who loves ghosts and thought this looked like a fun and innocent dvd for him to watch as Halloween approaches. The humor was completely inappropriate for his age, and I turned it off only a few minutes in. I suppose that older kids may enjoy if, but I wouldn't recommend it since I found the humor so crude and ridiculous. I guess if you find belching ghosts and snotty teen-age girls funny/enjoyable to watch, go for it."
1,Trash!,"I can see that others found this book exciting, but to me this was an all time low.I don't see the piont in naming pure sadism erotica. Punishment and no passion. Torture and no sex. Pleeding girls and merciless mistresses.In BDSM sexual fantasies, the punishment should be part of a sexual thrill which consequently leads to hot sex, concensual or not. At least that's my idea about this genre.So, if you like spanking, spanking and spanking, this is it. If you like BDSM sexual fantasies, find something else!"
4,Good Information,"we purchased this product because our son was just accepted as an enlisted crew member of the Blue Angels. although the program was focused on the pilots, it still gave us information about what his next three years with the BAs will involve. Thanks."
2,no satisfied,"ok ,i bought this video because i really loves aircrafts, but the documentary is not really intersting, and i just saw the blue angels flying in this video like 8 min,i;m sorry but i sent back this product the very next day, besides, the bonus material never works, i tried in my pc, laptop and my dvd,but nothing.sorry.."
2,New Beginning review,"My opinion of this book is pretty simple: Just plain horrible. You can't even completely blame the author because there were too many typos to count. But falling on the author(and editor)is that the material had not been proofed. I would hope that if you write a book about something that you have researched the details. I also remember on an episode from second season when Isabel is talking with Max about leaving for college and mentioning that she could change the value of money. I have to point out that in a section of the book when Michael, Max and Isabel are outside painting,Max is recalling a time back when he was thirteen and they were painting with his dad. Dad said he was glad Michael could join them but on one of the episodes Max and Isabel's mom had mentioned that she was surprised to never have met Michael before.Also, HOW MANY TIMES CAN THE AUTHOR HAVE MARIA CALL MICHAEL SPACEBOY?"
2,Is there an editor in the house?,"I'm only about a third of the way through this book, but I have to say I'm EXTREMELY disappointed in the proof-reading and editing. Three major errors in the first 12 pages is rediculous.The author can't even get the timing right. He indicates that Max and Michael have known each other for 18 years before leaving Roswell. They were six when they came out of the pods and weren't reunited for two years after that. This makes only 10 or 11 years together. Not 18. (although I would agree to 12 if you want to count the day wandering in the desert together.)It's so filled with errors, I'd think it was a vanity press edition of a fan-fiction. Although I've read better fan-fiction, too.There are some good points, but in general, I'm not at all impressed."
2,A nice attempt at the continuation of the TV show,"Well I read this book in one day, hopeing that I was going to like it as much as I liked the TV show. Having it kinda start off were season 3 left off was a great idea. I also like how past events that happened in the show, were linked to this book, but thats where the greatness ended. This book lacked a lot of key things that makes me a roswell fan. Where's the relationships?, Where's the comic relief?..... If your a Roswell fan you'll probably like it because of the fact that it's Roswell, but I was disappointed, especially at the end."
3,Locust - No-One In The World,"_No-one in the World_ gets turned into a thundering drum `n' bass ditty, courtesy of the ""DJ B. mix,"" with a thick atmospheric growl to haunt the lyrics. Armand Van Helden delivers two of his trademark hard house mixes, first with the rhythm-heavy ""Mack Mongoloid Mix"" that has plenty of filter sweeps and disco stabs, and later with his ""Mongoloidian Killer Bees mix"" that dispenses with the disco altogether. Frankenstein UV turns the track into hip-hop, an attempt that doesn't quite work, unfortunately."
2,GNR rocks! Use Your Illusion II doesn't!,"I absolutely did not enjoy the Use Your Illusion II album by Guns N' Roses. Except for the songs 'Civil War' and 'You Could Be Mine'. In my opinion, the album is just bad and somewhat silly. Use Your Illusion I is clearly the better album of the two. Don't get me wrong, I love Guns N' Roses, but Use Your Illusion II and The Sphagetti Incident, I think are GNR's worst albums. By the way, Geffen records has just released GNR's Greatest Hits album, inspight of Axl's objection. Anyway, the best songs from Use Your Illusion II are going to be on this greatist hits album. So don't even bother getting Use Your Illusion II."
2,14 Years,If you're looking to buy this album...do so...for one reason: the song 14 years. I would put it in my top 5 songs of all time.
2,A disappointment,"""Don't Cry"" and ""November Rain"" are the masterpieces, but the rest is junk. This and part I are the first and the last GNR albums I will ever buy."
1,worst!,this is one of the worst rock albums ever! i don't recommend it for you1 their debut was quite good! now they make awful lyrics!
1,Not one great song on this CD,"Weird, isn't it? GNR used to be a huge, gigantic, loud, big important rock band. Ten years later, it's hard to find more than 3 great songs on their magnum opus, Use Your Illusion. This disc, #2 of 2, has exactly ZERO great songs. ""Pretty Tied Up"" is okay --- sounds like something off of Appetite for Destruction. The rest is really BAD.""My World"" is a weak joke. ""So Fine"" features some of the world's worst singing and lyrics. ""Breakdown"" isn't even halfway complete. I don't need an alternate version of ""Don't Cry."" And ""Estranged"" sounds like Quiet Riot doing a bad impression of Queen.I dig that cover, though. Very arty!"
1,The worst cd ever,"Come on if your dumb enough to think your good enough to release to cds at the same time think again. The only singeles that were good Use your illusion 1 & 2 had were not even there own they were covers. If thats not alarm bells ringing of in their head before they release it i don't know what is. If they put the best songs on 1 cd and released it would still be [...]Thank god everyone else besides axel have had brilliant recording & releases since the break up of guns & roses, because axels a loser & everyone else deserves it for putting up with him.And Axel if you ever read this your lucky Vince Neil didn't knock you out ya loser!!!!!!!!"
5,Illusion 2,"Use Your Illusion 2 is part 2 of the Use Your Illusion albums . The remake of""Knockin On Heavens Door"" is good. ""Get in The Ring"" is a very funny song, but very explicet, but good. The punky ""Shotgun Blues"" is a fun song. ""Breakdown"" is a very good song . ""Pretty Tied Up"" is one of the most interesting songs on the album. It is very different. ""Locamotive"" is a great and very interesting song. ""You Could Be Mine"" is a fast paced song and one of the best. There is a version of ""Don't Cry"" with different lyrics. Some more popular songs like ""Estranged"", ""Civil War"", and ""So Fine"" . But this is a very great album from an amazing rock/metal group. This band had a world of talent. It's a shame that they have had so many problems. Buy the album ."
4,The weakest of the 2 still very good though.,Had So Fine been out of the picture in favor of a rock song on par with Civil War or You Could Be Mine it probably would have been given a higher rating.All the songs are excellent except the godawful So Fine and Get In The Ring.Its really too bad that they didnt have the album have ALL good songs but its still very entertaining.It doesnt rock as hard as Use Your Illusion 1 but it still rocks pretty hard with Shotgun Blues and Locomotive plus 14 Years and Civil War not to mention the best song on the album You Could Be Mine.In my opinion that song is worth the price alone.Its a strong album but a little bland in places.Shotgun Blues should have been done a couple more times until it sounded as heavy and punkish as Perfect Crime but that is forgiven with most of the other songs and you should buy it anyway.
4,GNR Goes Epic,"A very complex and moody album from GNR. Less rocking than its sister album Use Your Illusion 1, Illusions 2 finds GNR turning down the amps a tad, adding strings, piano solos, and songs dealing with bad relationships, war, failed friendships and how they want to put their pasts behind them.Illusion 2 is a very uneven album over the 14tracks, there are still a few classic GNR cuts like You Could Be Mine, 14 Years and Pretty Tied Up. But the strong points of the album are the Axl epics Civil War, Breakdown, Estranged and Dont Cry. Guns was transforming into something different and these songs show how the band could in no way shape or form be grouped with Motley Crue or even Aerosmith for that matter. This would be the album to play for non GNR fans who thought the band was just about teased hair and drinking booze.Strongest Cuts: Civil War, 14 Years, Yesterdays, Estranged, You Could Be Mine"
5,This CD Rocks,"I never really started listening to GNR until the beginning of this year when my friend played it in my car...I practically fell in love w/ civil war..i've been listening to this CD pretty much everyday in my dorm room...civil war, so fine, estranged, get in the ring, they're all great...the one thing i like about this cd and most of they're songs has to be the style of soft rock type then to hard rock and back kind of like what civil war is like...this is a must buy...lyrics get you thinking too sometimes"
5,certainly better than the first use your illusion,"aLthough this album is not nearly as good as appetite for destruction it is still an amazing album. What i would have liked better though was for them to have combined the two cd's and that would have been one of the greatest rock albums ever. my favorite songs on the album are ""estranged"" ""civil war"" and although i like the first illusion cut better ""don't cry"". i would not hve expected them to cover dylan so well but ""knockin on heavens door"" is a killer track. all in all it is an excellent album and it must be bought with its companion for the full guns n'roses experience"
3,Decent,Some songs in this album I could listen to over and over again and there are some songs that I could go without listening to ever. Hardly ever listen to it all the way through but the most notable songs are of Civil War and Knockin' On Heaven's Door.
4,USE YOUR ILLUSION RECORDS ARE GREAT!,"This music is great! Great followup to AFD and UYI1. Civil War,Knocking on Heavens Door, and You Could Be Mine are classics thatI could play over n over again 3 times in a row! 14 Years is alsogood, but overated. In my opinion, Estranged is the weakest songon the entire album. Oh well."
3,THS REVIEW FOR BACK IN BLACK VINYL VERSION!!!!,"This album is a FIVE STAR. ALL of Guns albums are. THIS VERSION of UYI I is a 3 STAR. Back to Black has been accused on several vinyl lovers sites of pressing CD Masters on vinyl. After getting original LPs of all of Guns albums to date, I would have to agree this version sounds like a CD. It does not sound like it came from an ANALOG source. Check out vinylengine.com for more on Back in Black vinyl. Recommend paying more and looking for an original issue from eBay."
3,bad album..... few good songs,"the great songs:civil war, 14 years, yesterdays, knockin' on heaven's door, don't cry, estranged, you could be minethe 0 songs:my world, pretty tied up, so fine, locomotive, breakdown, get in the ringthey are terrible!!the rest is..... o.ki don't recommend to buy this album.... not that good!"
4,See My Review Under Illusion 1,What can I say? I said it all in the first review. They could do a really good reissue of this as a double album.
2,Not As Good As Use Your Illusion I,"Besides G N' R Lies, I believe that Use Your Illusion II, is Guns N' Roses least impressive effort. If combined with Use Your Illusion I, I believe that it would have been more successful, and would be recognized as one of the '90s best albums. Unlike Use Your Illusion I, which features the great ""November Rain"", this album does not feature any hit songs. Excluding songs such as ""Knockin' On Heaven's Door"", ""14 Years"", ""Civil War"", and ""Yesterdays"", this album is weak. If your looking for a great album by Guns N' Roses, look into buying either, ""Appettite For Destruction"", ""Use Your Illusion I"", or ""Live Era '87-'93""."
2,"Too many fillers, and a too strained singer II","Guns `N' Roses ""Use you illusion II"" was released the same time as ""Use your illusion I"". Axl Rose has a very characteristic voice, and I'm certainly no fan of his high pitch strained approach. But I must admit that the G `N' R have written and performed some really good tunes, but it's obvious that they didn't have enough good material for two albums - too many fillers and too little highlights!Songs like ""14 years"", the Bob Dylan cover ""Knockin' on heaven's door"", ""Get in the ring"", and ""You could be mine"" are the best tracks. The rest is a variety of average songs and fillers."
2,Not as Good as UYI1,"UYI2 to me didn't have the same impact as UYI1 or AFD, but its really about personal taste. Some people prefer this album over UYI1, but I suggest if your only into the songs that got radio airplay, you will probably be happier with the ""greatest hits"" CD.Get in the ring, is a personal fav of mine, but the album to me sounds like it has ""fillers"" all over it. Unless your a gunners fan, this album may not appeal to you. And i again say, if the tracks you recognize are the ones on the greatest hits, go for that one."
3,Roses smell better than guns shoot,"Like its volume 1 counterpart, UYI2 contains enough memorable ballads and a few charming southern rockers to overlook a lengthy majority of dated work which doesn't necessarily stand the test of time."
3,A Monument To What Might Have Been,"I have the same problem with the ""Illusion"" albums as everyone else does. They both have their moments, again, as everyone has stated a million times, there is enough good material here to put together one memorable album, but not nearly enough for two. GnR was an excellent hard rocking band with a wide appeal, a band people somehow related to. Looking back on those days, it seems like such a shame. GnR were arguably the biggest band in the world when these albums were released, who knows how far they could have gone had the egomania inherent with such sudden, overwhelming success had been held in check? These rambling, incoherent albums, chock full of filler material and heavily laden with plenty of whining about the difficulties involved in Being Axl, diffused the wave of excitement they initially generated. They were largely met with mild enthusiasm, then bored yawns, which, listening to them now, they fully deserved."
4,Another GNR tour de force! I love 'em!,"GNR do it again! They just rock. Use 2 may just be better than 1 becuase there is less filler. Classic songs like Estranged and Civil War just make this album fantatic. Other amazing songs include 14 Yars, Ysterdays, a great cover of Knockin on Heaven's Door, the very funny Get in the Ring [it's mint,] Breakdown, Shotgun Blues, Locomotive, So Fine, Pretty Tied Up, You Could Be Mine etc are just tops. [Most the album really] but the alt. lyrics for Don't Cry ain't really worth putting on the disc and My World is just too wierd to bother with. Another Amazing album by the best band ever but not their best by a long shot. Appetite For Destruction takes that crown for being the finest album of all time and the gunner's best. All their albums are highly recommended tho."
3,this one,I bought this album because I wanted to hear the album in its entirety not just a few song from it and it is a great band
3,see my review of CD 1,"Like I said in my earlier review, this 2 CD monster is a mish-mash of ... and masterpiece and should have been carefully cropped and made into a single brilliant album. Shame.The first three songs on this album should have opened CD1 as they are extremely good (Civil War lyrics are a bit immature). The alternate version of Don't Cry should have been made a b-side for the curious collector, as with the appalling and by-the-numbers songs like shotgun blues, get in the ring (cringe) and my world. 'So fine'is ...., while the Dylan classic should never have been released as a single for such a huge band. Oh well.Standouts: civil war, 14 years, yesterdays, breakdown, pretty tied up, and (from Appetite left overs) you could be mine."
3,I've really tried to like this but....,"Use Your Illusion I and II... if they had taken out the filler and kept the good stuff... man... it would be equal or better than Appetite. I dont understand why anyone would like UYI2 more than 1 though... the first one has November Rain, Dont Cry, Coma, Live And Let Die (which i personally dont like.. but alot of people do.. so hey), and other classics.. while the second has just Civil War and Estranged. Plus UYI1 has all the rockin music like Garden Of Eden and Right Next Door To Hell.ALSO UYI2 HAS THE WORST GNR SONG EVER ON IT! MY WORLD IS CRAP. how could ANYONE like that song? It trys to be industral rock (think 9 inch nails) but ends up sounding like rap metal.. which we all know is BAD. Makes me sad that thats the direction Axl is taking GNR 2.0 on... the other lame song is Get In The Ring. crap!Overall... i would just download Civil War and Estranged instead of buying this. Buy #1 if you want a better CD. [...]"
3,The Beginning of the End for Guns and Roses,"This album was a disappointment compared to their debut Appetite for Destruction. The music just doesn't have the same quality. From here on out, GN'R went down hill. Still, there are some good songs and it's worth buying if you like this kind of rock."
5,Infaltable para la coleccion,El Illusion II es un disco imperdible para completar la coleccion de los fanaticos del buen rocck y que con la calidad de sonido del formato Vinyl se disfruta mejor.
5,Classic,"This is one of the greatest rock albums ever recorded. The whole Use Your Illusion enterprise is pretty staggering, but I could live without most of volume one. This one, however...A melodic rush from start to finish, with only a couple of weak links. If they'd dropped ""So Fine"" and put on their cover of the Rolling Stones' ""Sympathy for the Devil"", this album would be unopposed as the rock masterpiece of the nineties. The solos on ""Heaven's Door"" and ""Estranged"" make the rest of us guitarists look like amateurs. Axl's singing is distinctive and thrilling. The piano line on ""14 Years"" is bitchin'... I could go on all night. Hard Rock at its finest."
5,As good as the live class,"I took Nathan's class and this DVD was given as part of the materials. Since this was filmed during an actual class it's just like being there.Nathan goes step by step through each game, showing how to set up the games and the different types of games, when you need multiple worlds, how the rules translate into easy to understand shorthand, how to make inferences etc. Sometimes it seems like magic, but it really isn't.If you can't take his class then buy the DVD it is worth every penny."
4,Good Stuff,"I was able to review this video as part of Nathan's class. The video is very similar to being in class with him. He has a unique and often entertaining way of teaching. I've seen significant improvement in my performance on all of the LSAT sections thanks to Nathan's style and methods of teaching. The video breaks down 12 Logic games, step by step in the manner Nathan himself would actually have done it. Through this, Nathan teaches you some of the best ways to attack each question, quickly make inferences, and improve your score. If you are unable to attend an LSAT prep course, this video would be worth the money it costs. Keep in mind that the DVD does not include the tests that he reviews. You have to obtain those on your own, and without them the video would be hard to follow."
2,Extremely disappointed,"""So grab a pencil, fire up this DVD, and get it on."" Really?! And write on what using that ""pencil?"" The DVD comes without any supporting hard copy material. He just reads game rules and questions. It is difficult to follow if you don't have a paper copy of the game. I spent/wasted lots of time online trying to find games from 2011 LSAT . For $50.00 Amazon could attach printouts of 12 games. Extremely disappointed."
3,interesting,"I am an avid reader of slash, goth, horror, erotica, etc. While I found most of these stories to be well written (most do not have that sudden ending with no closure feeling that so many short stories suffer from these days).With that being said - I do not feel there was much erotica. Some stories didn't even include any overt erotic/sexual references. But still - they were good.I must add - one of the stories was the most disgusting (usually that's a good thing) concept/story I've ever read. And I'm one of those people that loved poppy z brites Exquisite Corpse.Overall - it's a pretty good read but if you are looking for sex and erotic situations you may want to adjust your expectations to include more fantasy and very indirect type hints of maybe sexual situations."
3,Pretty Good Overview.,"Nice overview of Mego's product lines. Not much commentary, detail or background information on the company or the toys it produced. Photographs could have been larger and cleaner. I would point out that if you are a fan of Mego's World's Greatest Super-Heroes Line, in particular, I would suggest you look to Benajmin Holcomb's book (""World's Greatest Toys""), which has much better coverage and incredible photography."
1,Big Disappointment,"Here is the second edition of John Bonavita's Mego action figure guide. The book's cover, which was questionably plain in the first edition, is repeated here with a different background color. This new guide is supposed to be revised and updated, but the only thing I see different are the enormously inflated values on many of these figures. I can count a handful of pictures that are actually new to this edition. I was looking forward to this book as I am an avid Mego collector, but I cannot express to you how disappointed I was in this revised edition. Everything is virtually the same. Some figures are curiously overpriced. (Example: a prototype that is valued at 6000.00, yet it is the only one and has never been sold - where does that value come from?)If you have the first edition of this book, it is enough for you to have some good reference, but this second edition is a total waste of money."
5,My hand-reading guru.,"I have been reading hands for 24 years, and if I could only read one book it would be this one. Ms. Hipskind is not only an expert hand reader, she's a top notch teacher. You will learn all the aspects of the entire hand, plus a very reliable system of approach for interpreting how different lines, mounds, shapes and colors impact your assessment of any given hand. If you want to learn hand reading, this is the one absolute must-have book. I re-read it at least in part a couple of times a year."
2,A Long Narrative of US Agression towards Latin America,"This book is a typical denunciation of US policy towards Latin America. It focuses on Cuba since the Revolution (1959), but covers events from countries throughout the region, including the Central American civil wars and the Southern Cone military dictatorships. Everything is true in the book; but its great weakness is that it is nothing more than a long list of events trying to show that US policy towards Latin America was belligerent in the latter half of the twentieth century. It lacks any original or dynamic interpretations. I would only recommend this book to someone who does not know, or believe, that the United States has behaved as an imperial power in Latin America."
5,Commprehensive,This text is a required reading for any Latin American course. I highly recommend it to anybody taking up their studies in this field.
5,A must read for the student of Latin American history,Overall an excellent book that deals with U.S. military interventions in Latin America from the perspective of a Latin American scholar. My one critique of the book is an obvious bias against the United States with no intent on even trying to be objective. I would still highly recommend it. The obvious biases aside it is an excellent tool in understanding why Latin American people and leaders have negative feelings towards the United States and why Latin Americans see the U.S. as the bad guys.
1,Is This Thing Out of Print Yet?!?,"'The Kimono Mind' makes a laymans effort to try to explain the intricacies of Japan. Rudofsky denounces the customs and history of the country as soon as he erroniously explains them. Ancient accounts from racist sailors are given to back up the history of Rudofsky's bad interpretations, lending to some downright obsurd and incorrect accusations of the Japanese people.This is a book that is not fit for anthropological research, and seems to only belong to a bygone era. If you are looking for the skewed American view of Japan from the 'The Kimono Mind's publishing date of 1965, this is the book for you. Typical of old white American men in 1965, the book has a racially biased tone and misquoted history to serve it's purposes. If you are rather searching for a quality read with anthropological fact and information on the Japanese as a people, look elsewhere."
4,Adds additional calories,"This product was recommended by the nutrionist to help my daughter (17 months old) gain weight. My daughter is a fussy eater and is on the lower percentile in weight. I was given samples by the nutrionist. Tried it and once I was satisfied bought this can.The powder dissolves easily. I only mix it with liquids though this can be mixed with anything. This does not add any taste. Basically this is tasteless. After using this powder (no other food changes), I found my daughter to be having a better appetite. She also gained weight due to the additional calories. I only use one scoop a day."
3,works for a while..?,"Ok, so it's supposed to be tasteless. It is not tasteless, if you put it in water you can definitely taste it. If you put it in ice cream you can feel the granules. My daughter is very very picky and she somehow has a 6th sense that I am trying to sneak it in things...(she is underweight and desperately needs more calories) and a lot of times she won't eat the food I put it in. We will have to try putting it in baked stuff. Works in scrambeled eggs sometimes."
5,Excellent product,Excellent book with easy directions and fast delivery. I look forward to making some lovely knitted shawls.
4,Beautiful if not traditional,"I bought this book believing that I would be given patterns from traditional shawls - ones straight from the cultures of their origin.But instead the book is a collection of traditional elements rejuggled and made new by the author's considerable talent.I was disappointed not to get the book that I thought I was buying. BUT! The shawls in this book are so elegant and beautiful that it was only a ""one-star"" disappointment. And I still have ""four-star"" satisfaction with the whole purchase."
5,My current favorite,I love this book! Each pattern has a short history of the country the pattern comes from. All the shawls are modeled by the author. It helps give a perspective of sizes and lengths. A wide variety of patterns and yarns really fascinate me. Informative and fun!
4,Beautiful patterns!,"I bought this book as an introduction to knitting lace shawls. I want to learn the basic increase/decrease and shaping techniques so that I can design my own patterns. For me, this book was the perfect place to start.In the current printing of this book, it appears the pattern errors have been eliminated. I went to the Interweave Press website to print the errata for the pattern I'm working on, and found that all of the mistakes had been corrected. If you have an older copy of the book, you can print the corrections from PDF files at the IP website.This book was highly recommended to me by other knitters when I asked what pattern books to purchase to learn lace knitting. The instructions are concise, and the charts are easy to read. The variety of patterns makes it a perfect book for experimenting with yarn substitution, and different lengths and shapes for shawls."
3,thorough,"comprehensive, creative showing of a number of traditional shawls. Some designs are original to the author. Cast-ons, and cast-off choices are considered and explained. Good, clear photos.Ironically, I have this book b/c other people made shawls from these patterns in other color-ways. The color and yarn choices in the book aren't particularly attractive, at least to my eyes. The Mustaa Villaa variation on the cover shawl sold the book, as far as I'm concerned.Nice interludes, quotes and research."
5,A shawl-knitting treasure,"With clear directions, easy-to-follow charts, and gorgeous photos, this book is truly a treasure for those who would knit shawls."
4,Shawlathon,"Many choices of shawls with a few paragraphs or one page of a folk tale to go along with theshawl, which is interesting Often there is a shorter version of the shawl, as well as the long version.Many are of the lace weight variety. Particular names of yarns are given and some specify laceweight orsport weight, but several do not give the weight of the yarn--an important detail for measuringgauge. Photos are excellent. Charts are good, but small. I would have to enlarge them much toread them easily, so if you like to knit from charts, this is an extra problem."
5,Knitted Shawls...Wonderful!,"Having long wished to acquire this book, I have now taken the plunge, feeling that I am ready to tackle some Cheryl Oberle lace patterns. The book does not disappoint. Beautiful, stylish, timeless designs. Can't wait to tackle a few of these. They are not too simple, nor too ""clunky"" because of large needles and chunky yarns. The instructions appear to be very thorough and clear, not intimidating, but just challenging enough to be interesting."
5,Awesome Paring Knifes,These knifes were even better than expected! Just love them. We have been searching for a small paring knife with a sharp and thin blade for years. My mother has difficulty with her hands as she has aged. The small paring knife in this set is just perfect for her needs!!! I could not be more pleased with this set...
5,3 pc ultra sharp,I like the new dishwasher safe handles. This is our 2nd set (first ones are probably 8-9 yrs old and still work great)
5,Rada Cutlery Paring Knives,The knives are great. Love them. Even give as gifts because they are so worth it. Stay sharp and when needed are easy to sharpen.
4,Great knife!,"Had a reasonable edge as is, I re-worked it with a Norton water stone and ended up with a great knife for preparing meats and fish!"
5,An unusual and entertaining novel,"An unusual and entertaining novel, French Postcards by Jane Merchant is the engaging story of Elinor and her husband's decision to move their family to France. As Elinor adjusts to the life among the French, French Postcards creatively depicts the progression of her unexpected attraction and relationship to a woman named Beatrice. French Postcards is an exotic narrative story of two women who betray their life with husbands and children for a love never before discovered or imagined, and is very highly recommended for its unique and diverse perspective on intimacy and passion, as well as love at its most pure and true state."
1,Annoying problems spoiled the value,"I just returned my third Viewsonic V36 in less than two weeks. Here were the problems and reason I am not buying another one: 1) Crackling sound 2)Backup battery never charged up 100% thus an annoying message would appear that said you need to recharge your backup battery or you will lose data 3) During average use, the battery only lasts for 1 - 2 days until you have to recharge. 4) Customer service is horrible. They never responded back to my problems and I called them 4 times! 5) The camera takes low quality pictures 6) The screen res is horrible. This is strange since Viewsonic makes decent monitors. 7) The playback audio, ie voice memo playback, is too soft to hear in a car. 8) Need I say more. Don't buy this unless you can deal with these issues. Other than that the price is pretty good for this end model."
2,"Poor construction, overpriced, but takes great pictures",I have brought this V36 from Compusa and I have had to return twice within 3 months. This unit is overpriced for its features and capablities. If you are thinking of buying this product I would recommend buying eaither a HP Pocket PC or a Dell Pocket PC. Also if you are thinking about putting a Wi-Fi (SD) Card and using it to access the internet and e-mails I would extremly advise you not to buy this product.But in saying this all the camera included in this PDA takes great pictures and even takes long video shoots.So far Compusa has stopped selling the product and I have recently brought a Dell Axim X30 which works great.
2,"cheap looking, questionable quality","Bought it on Amazon.com but there was a bad pixel on the screen. Exchanged for another one, still many problems:1. About 4 out of 5 attempts to synchronize with desktop computer failed;2. The record button doesn't work;3. Sometimes cannot turn off or turn on the unit;4. One leg of the battery cover was broken after a few uses.The design is horrible; Product looks very cheap; the built-in camera takes mediocre pictures. However, the screen is bright and vivid, which seems to the only thing impressed me."
5,Best PocketPC for the price,"Best PocketPC for the price!I researched a LOT of PocketPC's before I buy VeiwSonic V36 and I love it!MP3s, Videos, Voice, Photos, MS Compatibility,Definately the best PocketPC for the price! No problems so far - I am very pleased - I recommend this model to all."
1,"Nice, but only for 6 months Then you have to buy another","This is a very nice unit. The screen is clear the memory expandable, the price just right. THE MAJOR DRAWBACKS are that the computer burns out after 6-7 months leaving you high and dry with the company. The secondary battery fails even when you have the unit plugged into the charger erasing all of you files and system memory.[...] I would go with something that has a reputation for working longer than a goldfishes memory."
2,Cheap Price.......,"I brought this right before Christmas based on Internet reviews. I was very pleased with the V36 until after a few days when it started to shut itself off to where I had to do a soft reset. It doesn't do it all the time and sometimes doesn't happen for days. Its not a terrible thing, I don't loose any data but it is somewhat inconvenient when you want to jot down a quick note . I called Viewsonic and they sent me a replacement. After a few days the replacement started doing the same thing. I email Veiwsonics tech support and they said that it is a problem that they are working on. Recently (I've only had this replacement for about a month) this new replacement has started a new thing where the screen starts getting fuzzy and then nonresponsive to where I have to do a soft reset. When my V36 works, it works great and the little camera is nifty but not something that I would take a family photo with."
4,"It's ok, too bad there is so little suport from Microsoft","It works quite well as far as Pocket PC goes. It's a good little unit. I've not have a major problems with the hardware. It's a shame that Microsoft offers so little in the way of support. Too bad. This is my second Pocket PC, and probably the last. Microsoft's online help is pretty much useless, and that's all there is. If you are interested in the basic calendar type of stuff, you will probably be happy. If you need anything beyond that, good luck. The new sub-notebook computers with Windows-XP are so much more capable, why suffer ? I got a new Fujitsu and am very happy with it. It's a shame that the company who wrote the o/s treats it like an unwanted orphan. It's got such a great unrealised potential. I really wish MS would really get behind it."
3,Pretty good,"I've had this guide for a year or two. It's got good text and maps, but I've always thought that some or mostly all of the drawings are sort of nebulous. Even though I don't take this book out in the field, I still use it as a reference when deciding whether I've identified a new species of bird. Other than that, it's pretty good."
2,Substandard Printing,"If you are at all interested in birding or being able to use this book in the field, do not buy this version.I have this same book from 1966, learned to bird with the plates and information, and it was very useful to me as a beginner's field giude. I wanted an updated version, and the information in this new printing is indeed updated. But the pictures are very badly reproduced. My 44-year-old version looks brand new in comparison. The plates are blurry and over-exposed, making them look washed out and destroying important nuances. Also, the range maps that accompany each species are virtually unreadable (white against pale grey). It looks like a cheap black market knock off.As a fan of the original, I'm totally disappointed."
3,Disappointing but still useful,"I regretted replacing my old 1966 Birds of No Amer book which has held up and served me well.Surely, it was time for a replacement, but I am disappointed. The light print of the range maps makes them very difficult to read. Extension of the page text and photos up to the binding makes me skeptical that the binding will hold up to the stress needed to fully open the pages. Also, I really miss the check boxes in the Index.The new version is certainly more convenient to carry around than the superior but much larger and heavier Sibley book. So I still rely on this book when birding, but the publisher should have done much better."
5,Bird Enthusiast,"This is definitely a ""must have"" book for any and all bird watchers out there. Best on the market."
1,why get the inferior book?,"Were this the only guide to North American birds, I would emphatically recommend it. However, it is not. The Sibley's guides have come out; they are leagues ahead of this one in clarity, accuracy, and pure and simple artistic beauty.I also strongly recommend the National geographic series guides, third or fourth editions.Getting this book would be like buying a 20 years old, cosmetically refurbished car for 4500 dollars when you could get a brand new, superior model for 5500 dollars."
2,Latest Edition Very disappointing illustrations,"I've been a birder for nearly 30 years. Having renewed my interest recently I decided to update my bird identification book with the latest of the classic and fabulous golden field guide (my copy is 30 years old). So I purchased the newest edition with the Eagles on the front. When I received it, I was so disappointed by the illustrations, which were copies of the original with about 90% less ink used to print. I couldn't believe how shoddy the reproduction process was for this latest edition. It is my understanding that there is a new publisher for this edition. Buy the earlier versions with the 3 Buntings on the front and avoid the eagle version....very disappointing."
5,Handy addition,This book is a very handy addition to any household. I bought 3! One for our house and each of my married childrens homes..they LOVE it!
3,good buy,"easy to use if you have a general knowledge of ornithology, but can be frustrating if you have no idea what kind of bird you are looking at"
4,A classic with uncommon features.,"This book's extensive use of sonograms distinguishes it from its more popular competitors. Overall, an excellent resource."
2,Birder from Wisconsin,"I bought this book for a college level ornithology calss and did not find it very helpful. I very much perfer the Peterson's field guide. The illustrations are not very detailed, and often look confusingly similar to one another. Unfortunately, the Peterson's foeld guide comes in two seperate volumes, and there is much overlap. This book is nice in that it covers the entire country in one concise volume. But, if you are planning on traveling and bringing your field guide with you, I feel that the Peterson's field guides are a much better choice."
2,Pale pictures,"As a ""birder"", I use an earlier edition of the Golden Guide that I love, but needed a newer version with updated range maps, etc. The pictures in this 2001 edition are dull and blurred, like an image that has been photocopied too many times. I compared it to my 1966 edition, which after much use, still has pictures that are crisp, and colors vibrant."
5,great buy,This guide is wonderful. The pictures are very descriptive and make it easy to identify different birds.
4,A story that needs to be told,"This tells a story about the Pacific theater of WWII that needs to be told. It is an interesting history, although it suffers some from it's constant references to the fictionalized Hollywood movie. If you have not seen the Hollywood movie recently you might want to watch it first. After seeing that you will want to know the real story anyway, and this DVD will mean more to you that way."
4,True Story of Bridge on River Kwai,The video arrived in excellent shape and in a timely manner. I would order from them again.
3,Slow going,"This works but it takes allot of time and effort to cut through anything. Just look at at a video of someone using it on Youtube and you will see them out of breath by the time they get through a 2"" thick stick. It would get the job done in an emergency situation but I feel like there would be more beneficial things to expel your energy on in an emergency. I know a fire is important but I would rather break up many more smaller sticks by hand much faster than to wear myself out cutting one thicker stick with this thing. It doesn't seem practical to use this on sticks much thicker than you can break by hand. I still believe a saw is important so that you don't hurt yourself breaking sticks, I just don't think this one is going to cut it. It is more of a flaw in the concept than the actual product though. It does seem well made and durable compared to other wire saws I have seen, so if you insist on buying a wire saw I would recommend this one, it just isn't for me."
3,Compared with an emery board ...,"... the wire saw is only slightly heavier and cuts significantly better. However, it won't perform miracles & if you plan on going out into the woods & cutting anything that's more than an inch thick, you should be looking into a more serious (& inevitably somewhat heavier & more substantial) saw."
5,Easy to carry and works great,"I've used this out in the yard for a few smallish trees and I found it easy to use. I found that the rings will wear your fingers out after a few minutes, but if you put a couple of sticks in there as handles you can go for hours. My advice on carrying it is to put is in a small tough container for travelling and camping. The cord is abrasive enough to slowly slice through fabric."
3,Came broken,"The blue on the bongos looked really, and it looked like it was great quality until the metal piece at the bottom came off when I took it out of the box. This was suppose to be a Xmas for my boyfriend this year, however I sent it back. I'm sure I got probably the defective one, but wish it was not. Now order another set of bongos on Amazon. If you want to give this seller a chance go ahead, just cross your fingers and hope you don't receive a broken product."
5,How to make a natural deodorant,I use this with Coco butter and a neutral sent to make my own deodorant and it works wonders and smells nice.
4,What's in a name?,Having used the Porter Cable biscuits for many years I thought I'd try these just see if I was missing anything. Under close inspection they appear to come from the same machinery and are made of the same wood. I see no meaningful difference and would not pay a premium for the Freud name.
5,You will play this all the time..,"For years I had a bootleg cassette of this show...I loved it and converted it to CD....when it came out on DVD I had to watch it and get a good sounding copy...the DVD did not disappoint....Jerry is on 2 songs and he looks and sounds great...I would say his appearance is worth the price of the dvd, except that every song is great.....its not a wild dancing in the isle dvd...the audience is quiet between sonds...it just has the quality in sound and picture that is viewable time after time..."
2,It should be a lot better than this,"I've waited alongtime for Bruce Hornsby to come out on DVD. I was disappointed. Its too much like watching a VHS tape. After watching the Eagles Hell Freezes Over DVD and a few others, you expect the sound and video on new DVD's to be up to current standards. This was not. I don't understand why they wouldn't do a new concert using today's video and audio capabilities. I would hope if Bruce does another DVD, that it also include some of his other songs that were not on this DVD. Looks like I'll have to keep waiting."
4,A legend at her best,"Bernadette Peters is at her best in this concert, warm, energetic, tender. The selection of songs is very good and her interpretations are inspired. She makes the most of her vocal range and one of a kind sound. Even though this is a follow up to the original album it is a great album in its own right. You won't be disapointed.Jennifer K. LaffertyAuthor of Offbeat Love Stories and More"
2,applause is far too loud,There is far too little Sondheim and far too much over amplified applause. I wish I had listened before I purchased. Even the good song selections are hampered by the tedious applause.
1,"OBSOLETE - Buy the new edition, just published!","OBSOLETE - Buy the new edition, just published! The revisions have been extensive, not only for species, but certain important plant families have been seriously re-defined. Recommend avoiding this old edition, even if someone gives you their copy for free.http://www.amazon.com/Jepson-Manual-Vascular-California-Thoroughly/dp/0520253124/ref=pd_sim_b_1"
5,Scooby-Doo Collection,Scooby-Doo adventures were my kids' favorite-- lots of fun to watch and reenact. They're all here in this fabulous collection.
1,blah...,"I am a hug fan of the Ambient and Dark Wave genres. This disc was given to me as a present. Luckily, as they say, it is the thought that counts; this disc is awful. Much criticism is heaped on Ambient/Dark Wave artists and it is from recordings such as Mercy where most of the blame should ""fall."" The occasional use of unique samples does not cover the tired themes, mundane lyrics and bland choir-girl vocals. Just awful. I do agree with some of the previous reviews in regards to being able to readily identify the musical ""influences"" on this disc. Sadly, there is NOTHING new here. The entire presentation lacks originality; from the crudely designed cartoon-like cover, to the overuse of antiquated lyrical and melodic schemes. If you are a fan of this type of music, I highly suggest you check out Lycia, Soul Whirling Somewhere or some older Cleopatra label recordings."
1,"""not my cup o' tea...""","I found Falling You's ""Mercy"" to be a little dull. As a debut disc, the band can be forgiven for so obviously borrowing from its influences, but one can only hope their writing matures and finds some spark of personality."
4,"Well done CD, most of it is quite good.","I enjoyed nearly all of the songs; Halloween is very dark, I couldn't even listen to the whole thing, I just hit the skip button on my CD player. ""When Will It End?"" reminded me of some of the hard times I fell on when I was younger, and could identify with some of it. Mercy is the best song on the whole CD by far... so is Feathered.... beautiful.. reminds me of a seashore, watching the seagulls. Excellent piece of work. It would receive 5 stars if Halloween were not on the CD."
1,Just not my thing,I am going to appear very ungrateful. I won this disc from their record company website and I honestly just think it is awful. The songs never form into any memorable melody. Things just seem to ramble on and on and on. A lot of the songs are similar to the music of John Tesh (only with a female voice). Quite droning at times. Definitely not something which would inspire me to purchase anything else from their label.
4,To look at yourself and make a wish...,"As a young African-American teenager going through major surgery, this book was a such a gift that helped me to take my mind out of a semi-private room in a children's hospital, and to exercise my fantasy of being Geeder. Virginia Hamiliton's writing is simple, but powerful; the emotions very realistic and can be taken to heart. Most important, it speaks of differences among the ""same""; the acceptance of the diversity."
2,Left in wonder,I would not recommend this book Zeely for many reasons. One reason is because the ending left you in wonder. What ever happened to the Mom and Dad? Also what happen to the Aunt? Another reason was because some parts I didnt get. The whole begining I didnt really follow to well. The last reason is because the story didnt really make sense. If I were you I wouldnt read this book.
2,Not my type.,"I would give this book a star rating of two because it's a really boring book. The good points about this book are that Zeely came out better than the others in the town. This book was all about how Zeely was being teased and was talked about because of her color and how tall she was for her age. Zeely's parents both died, so Zeely has moved on to a farm with her uncle. Also Zeely turns out to look like an African American Queen."
3,Away from the Trenches?,"This book is a good, basic book outlining the grief process and other major common emotional issues in raising a child with a disability. However, as the mother of an autistic child who is with her child 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, I can't help but wonder about the authenticity of the author's personal experience ""parenting"" an autistic child, as his own autistic child has been institutionalized for a huge segment of his life while the author went on to have more children and a very normal homelife. It feels to me like the man ""skipped out"" on the real experience of raising his autistic son himself and elected to become a part-time parent to the child, then felt himself capable of writing a book about it. I find it hard to believe that he truly understands the day to day life of a full-time parent of an autistic child, given his own choices, however ""right"" they may have been for his son."
5,Excellent book!,"I would recommend this book to anyone with children even those without special needs. Dr. Naseef tells of his experience as a parent as well as a therapist. It's one of those books that when you read it you catch yourself thinking ""I thought I was the only one who felt that way"". I would also recommend seeing one of Dr. Naseef's lectures or looking up his webpage oneline."
2,HORRIBLE BOOK NOTES,Chief is gay. Oh yea horrible book notes because it did not mention details in the plot of the good earth.
5,bells of coronado,roy rogers dvd bells of coronado is a 5 star movie it is restored the true color clear and it is uncut 67 min.run time i hope they bring out more roy rogers movies restored in true color and uncut bring out all of his true color movies the far frontier and under california stars in true color and uncut iam sure roy rogers fans agree with me.
2,Throw it against a wall and see what sticks,"With the exception of a few standout tracks conveniently stored at the beginning, middle, and end of this generic indulgence, the incident reeks of moldy, old school hard rock homage. Fitting in shedding light on their ""Guns"" aspect, the ""Roses"" side ends up feeling rather cheated."
2,Mixed feelings,"O.K., let's get one thing straight: I love Guns N' Roses. What I don't love, however, is this collection of cover songs, which includes the unlisted bonus track ""Look at Your Game, Girl"" (written by mass murderer Charles Manson). It's kind of a grab-bag of the bands' favorite old punk songs, and not really a true GN'R album. Get it (if you must) as close to dirt-cheap as possible. 'Nuff said."
1,ARE YOU KIDDING?,"Alright, i love guns n roses and i love spaghetti, but this has gotta be one of thier worst cd's. After something so great like Appetite for Destruction, i am upset. That's why when i bought this cd, i listened to it once, burned it and will never hear it again. To summerize this review, DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!!!"
2,A Sad Ending For Gn'R,"If you are a great Gn'R fan and you won't change your opinion don't buy this album, is the worst album by Gn'R (I give Use Your Illusions I and II 5 stars)"
2,I spent money on this?!,"It was on sale, so I bought it, and I can't believe I did. I like one, maybe two songs on it, and I love Guns! I kinda wish I hadn't bought it, but, for the sake of owning all of their albums, it had to be included."
4,Covers by GNR,"It's an odd collection of peculiar songs. Some of them you've heard of before - others probably never. Look for the hidden track by one, Charles Manson..."
5,Underrated,"Spaghetti is one of the most underrated releases of all time. It rocks from beginning to end. Usually Spaghetti gets ranked below GNR Lies as their worst release. This is only because Spaghetti lacked the big single that Lies had in ""Patience."" This record aims to do nothing but rock out hard, and it delivers the goods with aplomb."
5,An Enjoyable Incident,"I bought this CD eleven years after its release and wasn't disappointed. It sold poorly when it first came out and has received horrible press ever since, but for me, hearing the old numbers from my favorite band was invigorating. Duff sings on several songs (New Rose, Attitude, You Can't Put Your Arms ARound a Memory), and Axl displays wonderful range and a variety of voices in his unique way (Since I Don't Have You, Down on the Farm, I Don't Care About You). A Charles Manson-penned tune appears on the original release, though unmentioned in the liner notes. Highlights of the CD include the groove-driven ""Black Leather,"" the anthemic ""Attitude,"" and the haunting cover of the Skyliners' ""Since I Don't Have You."" A must have!"
3,Not bad but doesnt measure up to their standard,"The problem here is their covering other musician songs and not really putting the GNR gritty edge to it. Basically Slash goes through the motions without any attempt to put his own spin on each song and the result is that the songs sound almost similar to the original versions with the exception of Axels screaching vocals. The best song on here in my opinon is Hair of the Dog which is a highly energized but, once again I only hear Axels presence and not Slashes signarture riffs or the whole GNR vibe from the rest of the band. Axel may as well have sung this stuff on his own as a goof."
3,"Good,but not Great","Honestly the weak link in the Golden Age GnR catalog.Some good songs like ""Ain't It Fun"",""Hair On the Dog"",""Buick Machine"",""Since I Don't Have You"", and ""You Can't Put Your Arms Around A Memory"" are fitting, but there's a lacking focus.Is the problem not having the classic lineup? Axl and Slash not talking? Izzy not being there(why cut his parts?)? Overall, it's six guys.If a Steven-esque drummer who's accidental,sloppy even,no keyboard player(Sorry Dizzy), and more interest in the album were present, it could work.Gilby fits in well enough, and could be the rythym player on post-Izzy tracks.Generally,it's hit-and-mess."
3,"By far not the best work of G'NR, even if it's a strange combination of covers very far from a rock roll sound.","Weird sound, funny tribute, but as Guns don't have a large discography is good to expend a little money on every single piece."
2,Disappointed GNR fan,I was let down by this albulm. I have liked all the GNR albulms but this one has been played the least. There a couple good songs but it is not one I can pop in a listen to all the way through. If you are collecting all their work I would put this towards the bottm of the list.
4,the last cd was their final,"some song are good, but still guns n' roses was the best. recomented only if you collect their cd's"
3,Eh...,"Honestly, I've heard worse. But when are covers, or even Guns and Roses themselves, THAT good? Some of those songs like New Rose (even though it was mid-tempo and unimpressive) and Raw Power (I admit, I have heard worse) have such powerful riffs you can't screw up the song as long as you have a semi-alive guitar player. But on the other hand, what Axl did to ""Human Being,"" an excellent tune by my favorite band the New York Dolls, is enough to curdle the blood."
3,out of their element,"Guns N Roses are one of the all time greatest bands.So why are they so schizophrenic ?I suppose they truly love the songs they covered here and set out to be faithfull to the originals. But it came up sounding a bit flat. And if the hidden song had been ""Garbage Dump"" by the same Mr. Manson would that have made this truly apprehensible ? Anyone who knows the source of ""Look At Your Game Girl"" would know what I mean."
5,"FOR CHRIST SAKES, THIS ALBUM IS JUST COVER SONGS!","ALL IT WAS, WAS TO HAVE SOMETHING NEW FOR THE FANS TO LISTEN TO WHILE NEW MATERIAL WAS BEING MADE!Sadly it's been a long time in waiting for new material. BUT C'MON, SINCE I DON'T HAVE YOU, NEW ROSE, ATTITUDE, AND BLACK LEATHER are very GOOD SONGS. HAIR OF THE DOG is an exceptional song, and to hear it is worth buying the album. I was also very surprised with the hidden track at the end ""LOOK AT YOUR GAME GIRL"" Is A WORK OF ART!"
3,what did you do with the band?,"Is this Guns 'N Roses? What did you do with Axle? Now I just got the CD and I am only on track 9, but so far unimpressed. I miss the great lyrics, and in your face beat of songs like Rocket Queen and Crazy. It's like a CD to tide you over till something better comes out. It's not a bad CD but it lacks any real hits. At the price a good addition to any fan's collection, But a far cry from the likes of Apetite or Lies."
1,A sad ending to a great band,"Guns started out great but deteriorated as time went on. This CD is by far their worst effort. Unless you are really into GnR, skip this one."
3,Unfairly Ridiculed,"No, ""TSI"" isn't a great album, or even a great stopgap album (what it's a stopgap FOR is anyone's guess at this point).Still, it doesn't deserve to be a punchline. In their quest to ""punk it up,"" GNR mistakenly picked a list of songs without much range; hurting the work as a whole. It also doesn't sound like they were very INSPIRED by some of the tunes (Raw Power and I Don't Care About You especially), the results being flat cover versions.Nonetheless, when you have a gang of supremely talented musicians in the studio, good things are bound to happen. ""Ain't It Fun"" is great, as is Down On the Farm (originally slated to appear on one of the Illusion records). I can also listen to YCPYAAAM, Hair of the Dog, Attitude, and the Manson jingle.Bottom-line: ""Spaghetti"" isn't memorable or even Guns-worthy, but it shouldn't evoke laughter either."
4,Good work,"Duff really takes control and delivers while axel helps out with the classic ""Ain't it fun"".A must for G N R fans"
3,give it a chance,"everybody keeps saying this is the worst GNR album,but I don't thinksaw.Its true that after the leaving of Izzy Stradlin of GNR the band wasnt the same anymore,but Gilby Clarke its a good musician too.The tracks in this album are very good,but they dont have the personality or charisma that the clasic GNR songs have."
3,Not as bad as everyone says it is,"This album still gets trashed by the rock press and the public alike. Some of this criticism is deserved. In 1993, with Nirvana and Pearl Jam at their apex, Guns N' Roses doing an album mostly of punk rock covers seemed like a lame attempt at the musical credibility they had thrown away with pap like ""November Rain"" and ""Don't Cry"". Furthermore, the cover of Charles Manson's ""Look at Your Game Girl"" is done in the poorest taste imagineable....However, the rest of the CD really isn't that bad. ...Some of their versions are almost as good as the originals (e.g., Nazareth's ""Hair of the Dog""). If you're a die-hard GNR fan, or simply a hard rock enthusiast, then you should get ""The Spaghetti Incident?""--preferably at a bargain price."
4,"A great cover album, but that's all it is...","Guns N' Roses at least (in most cases) have the sense to know that if they remake a song; they will make it better than the original. Almost every song on this album is better than it's original version. An album like this needed to be followed up by new material though. It kicks a**, and is a respectful tribute."
1,For diehard GNR fans only,"Save your hard-earned money, folks. This album is the epitome of laziness and ego. When a band thinks you want to hear its interpretations of other artists' songs, you know they've jumped the shark. Skid Row fell into a similar trap around the same time."
1,Hmmm ...,"This was just strange as far as I'm concerned. It's not unusual for a band to do cover songs, but it is unusual for a band to put out an entire album of cover songs. I wonder why they - or let's be frank here, Axl - felt like he needed to do this. To say this was a weak ending to their career is the difference between shooting a bullet and throwing it. After the phenomenal success of the Illusion albums we get ... this? Well, it's something. Covers are covers, even if it's one you really like. I never listen to this one, but it will remain in my collection. This is like all those boxes of cereal in the pantry - not enough to eat but too much to throw away."
3,Okay,"What the hell did they expect us to hear, I bought this thinking that it would be filled with classics such as November Rain and not to mention Rocket Queen, Sweet Child o mine...... But now I hear Axl (probably) braying on the speaker. Shame on them. Waste o125rs..."
1,pathetic,wat in the hell is this crap use ur illusion 1/2 were good appetite for destruction waz amazing but the spagetti incedint? wat kinda name is that
1,Guns N Roses hit rock bottom,"The Spagetti Incedent was Guns N Roses last ablum. They really fell from glory. First of all the album is 100% remakes. In the past GNR has done great remakes like ""Knockin on Heavens Door"" and ""Live and Let Die"". These were lousy remakes. They even did a remake of a remake. This was the first CD without Izzy. He did a lot of the writing. Maybe he was the talent of the group. Hopefully GNR will make a new CD to make up for this.Nate Dusek"
4,GNR's best album,"By far their best. The version of ""Ain't it Fun"" is about as good as the original, which says a lot. ""Human Being"" is unstoppable and exuberant. ""New Rose"" is very fine."
2,Not good to be a Guns album,Although I am a Guns fan I did not like this album.The only song I like in this album is Since I Don't Have You. The overall album is not good.Still one of the few Guns albums...
1,dont waste your time,"this pile of crap, like all poser efforts, was created to make money. after the 91/92 punk revolution via grunge, tons of bands jumped on the bandwagon to cash in. after realizing they had lost much of their fanbase during this period, gnr decided to try to gain some street cred by covering some old alternative songs and a golden oldie, but by doing so they proved just how little musical ability they had. all the songs they covered were played in the exact format as the original with the exact same instrumental accompinament. the old boys from la did nothing new and nothing creative. but i do have to give them credit for one thing they did right, saying in the liner notes to pick up the original records, how true."
2,Waste of time,"I'll give it 2 stars for GNR being a great rock band when they want to be and good musicians, but there was no reason for this mess to be recorded. They did so much of this over their career, recording meaningless covers and EPs because they couldn't get their act together and record a real record. Except for maybe ""Down on the Farm"", this is a collection of boring covers of mostly boring songs. Another vanity project from Axl to suck money out of fans to fund his never-ending Chinese Democracy."
1,Thank god it's over,"The stertorous sounds in the album reflect the band's agonizing last moments. At its very centre, the theme, as we find out if unlucky enough to purchase this lemon, is simply Rose's last temper tantrum driven by an overblown ego and the belief that he is the band. Gone are Slash's spirit and the band's pretence of staying together. No good."
3,GOT IT IN 7 DAYS,"I RECIEVED THE CD IN 7 DAYS. IT'S NOT GNR'S BEST WORK, BUT AMAZON GOT IT TO ME PRONTO."
3,"Previously done tracks, but still alright","I would have to say that none of the songs on this album were done or, I should say WRITTEN by G'N'R. They just performed them. They focused on oldies, 70's and mid-eighties that inspired them. It was a tribute album for every band or artist that made G'N'R...G'N'R. Although I would have expected better from them, since this album was poorly produced. It is still part of my collection. (in fact i bought it from amazon.com about 6 months ago) I have listened to it about 4 times and it is really not that bad, nor is it that good. So it's basically just a ""filler"" album to help your collection. I can only recommend this to Guns and Roses fans that have just about all their other stuff (Use Your Illusion I and II;Appetite;ect.) If you are getting this just because its cheap, or a friend recommends this to you, you will more than likely be disappointed in it. So I can only recommend this to real Guns and Roses fans. Keep it real!"
3,"GNR, punk?","I dunno, I am a huge GNR fan but could never hear them singing some of the songs they did. Nonetheless, they did an excellent job of redo-ing these classics, but it's just not GNR without Axl, Slash, AND Izzy dishing out their own material. ""Black Leather"" and ""New Rose"" are undisputely great songs though!"
3,Guns N' Roses - 'The Spaghetti Incident' (Geffen),"When I first saw the track listing for this disc,I honestly thought it was an error.I mean come on,giant-sized ego Axl Rose doing an entire lp of other artist's songs?Okay,maybe it isn't all THAT far fetched.Actually,Axl and crew did a decent job on most of these remakes.I remember most of these tunes.I dug their versions of the New York Doll's ""Human Being"",the Stooges cover ""Raw Power"",T.Rex's Marc Bolan's ""Buick MacKane"",Nazareth's ""Hair Of The Dog""(always thought Axl got some heavy influence from this band) and the UK Sub's ""Down On The Farm""(nice accent).There were a few that didn't do much for me,like Danzig's ""Attitude"" and Steve Jone's(Sex Pistols guitarist)""Black Leather"".Okay disc just the same."
3,"Actually, 3 and 1/2 Stars","Nearly everywhere you look this album get horrible reviews. It's not great by any means, but it's a lot better than it's made out to be. There are some really good songs, namely Since I Don't Have You and Hair Of The Dog, but there's some real filler too. I wouldn't say it's a must-have, but it's worthwhile if you like the band. However, the fact that all the songs are covers makes this album less of an accomplishment than it appears. It appears on the surface to be something of a contract album, or more accurately, something to tide the fans over until some new original G N'R material was released. Problem is, it's been 7 years and we still haven't seen any new material (aside from the dreadful Oh My God, the biggest disappointment in music history aside from Van Halen 3), and they actually had to release more holdover material in Live Era '87-'93."
3,Business Start Up but no wedding info,"This book was good for the start up of your business, and had some very helpful tips to that, but there was no wedding planning knowledge included in it. You could basically use this book to start up ANY type of business. I found the ""Start Your Own Event Planning Business: Your Step-By-Step Guide to Success"" was much more informative also."
4,Start Your Own Wedding Consultant Business Book,"This book was overall a good book if you're looking for good business sense. It really doesn't do the job on helping you get started with the actal planning business, just business."
3,Help anyone?????,"Surrounded by glowing reviews, I hate to be the only dissenter. My set has been very dissapointing. On my Sears contractor saw each blade cuts at a distenctly different level. The resulting groove or dado can look positivly sawtooth. Are there problems with fit on Sears saws??? This is dispite considerable shiming and jiggling, and yes, I sequence them in the prescribed order (and have tried varying the order, also.) The set does look quality manufactured, but for me it has not been a good purchase; I now go to my router for almost everything and the dado set stays in the box."
3,somewhat disappointed,"I chose this dado set based on the top reviews, and I am somewhat disappointed in the product. A substantial number of the carbide tips on both the outside blades and the chippers have imperfections and chips. The brazing is not as uniform as other saw blades I own. Some of the chippers were a little rusty. The cuts are decent, though the points of the ATB outer blades leave a fine but slightly deeper groove than the chippers at the extreme edge of the dado. Additionally, the chippers cut about 1/100 of an inch shallower than the outer blades, so I have to clean up every single cut when making a box joint."
4,"Cuts flat and true, but it had a chipped tooth on a chipper.","I probably won't ever cut more than a 3/4"" dado, so the chipped chipper was a spare anyway, but I still say it should have arrived in factory condition. I thought the package was a little flimsy, and no doubt the reason the carbide was able to chip out in the first place. This is a real pricey dado blade set, so a better system of cutter separation would have been much appreciated.I have made several cuts with it, and I haven't had any tear out, or chipped work pieces as of yet. I usually prefer to use my router for dado cuts, but if I am going to be making a whole lot of small repetitive dado's and rabbets, then the blade is worth the time and set-up.Some reviewers had trouble with the shims and their arbor, but I had no issues. I am using this set on a Jet JTAS 10."
4,I Got Bad One Too,"Based on the one other poor review about the blade size, I didn't think I would see a problem. When I received the blade, I threw it on the saw, and there was a distinct notch from the inside blade. Not the chipper this time. I sent it back and my second set was perfect. Hats off to Amazon on the timeliness of the swap."
5,great blade that makes great cuts,"its alot of money for a blade but the forest dado king is even more, but you get what you pay for. this blade cuts great, oak plywood to solid stock.i bought this blade because of the good reviews and i am happy i did.ya the case is not top notch and the shims are not labled but why does it matter mark them yourself.make a new case out of wood, we are woodworkers..right hey i did not even expect a case.happy customer and amazon is great"
4,Excellent if you are not using the 1/16 or 3/32 chipper,"I expected a flat bottom based on all the other reviews, but when using the 1/16 or 3/32 chipper I find that they are both slightly (about 1/64) larger in diameter than the other chippers or the side blades. Both of these chippers leave a distinct notch in the bottom of an otherwise perfect dado. While this does not really affect the performance of the joint the notch is noticeable when the two pieces of wood are joined together. I must say that it does a fine job if the thin chippers are not used but I expected more from a premium dado set."
3,as good as they say??????,"I have this set in the 6"" size, and the less expensive 8"" in the professional series. While the 6"" does seem to hold ""slightly"" tighter tolerances IT DOES NOT MAKE SMOOTHER BOTTOMS than the 8"" set AND the tolerances are so tight on the shaft that sometimes it takes up to 30 mins. and lots of cussin, to get multiple chippers off the motor shaft. Save urself time and money with the 8"" professional set........"
5,Quality dado set,"I've had this dado set for about 4 years and have plowed untold feet of dadoes and grooves in hardwood, plywood and MDF. I can always count on getting clean, chipout free, flat bottomed dadoes with this set. The 3/32"" chipper makes it much easier to set up for undersized plywood or oversize laminates.If you're looking for the same quality for a less money, consider Freud's 6"" stacked dado set."
4,Appeals to the 11 year old in everyone.,"Every ""Hank"" book is the same, and every one a pleasure. I read them aloud to my 5th graders, to my kids and to myself. We all enjoy ourselves, sometimes laughing out loud. Hank is arrogant enough to laugh at, and his entourage provides a perfect backdrop for his inevitable comeupance. One thumb, way up!"
3,good enough,"Descent amp for the money. I have my front speakers running through the speaker level inputs and my rears and subwoofer feeding from the rca line-level outs on the receiver. The amp runs well BUT, I had to fine tune the input level for the line inputs as the rear speakers (channels 3 and 4 on the line level) will CUT OUT if I turn up the volume on my Dual CD receiver.BOTTOM LINE: I have to limit my volume on the line level inputs or the amp will cut out."
2,Interesting but achingly badly written,"No one's going to buy a book about the making of Voyager if they don't like Voyager, so it's understandable that the writer refrains from any criticism. Yet he adopts the tone that Voyager is unrivalled high-quality drama and whether you believe him or not it rankles enough to make you wince through even the really interesting sections on the making of the show's pilot film. There's also a peculiar habit of trying to force a structure to the book by leaving bits out from the beginning and throwing them in at the end which you might live with if there were an index. Poe is a name in Star Trek circles because he wrote The Making of Star Trek (under a psuedonym) but where you can excuse the poor journalism of that book because he was new and fresh, thirty years later you feel he should have improved."
4,"Worth Reading, Tad Disorganized","Very interesting. Photos are wonderful. Entertained my curiosity about Star Trek"" Voyager. However, several times I looked for an Index, yet there is none. I would have also liked the book to be a little more organized."
2,So So,"If you like endless detailed descriptions of people's offices, their small working areas at Paramount and all the minute production details explaining how this series got off the ground then this book is for you. If you want to know about all the people who are involved with Voyager from the top brass to the two security people on the lot then this book is also for you.If you're interested in the DRY, nuts and bolts of making a TV series then this is for you. Not my cup of tea I'm afraid."
4,Children Of The Reeds...,"Yet another group of young, beautiful people take a trip into unknown, terror-filled territory. This time out, they take a boat into THE REEDS, where they encounter juvenile delinquents, tragedy, and death. After the first few minutes, I settled in for one more killer-kids-from-hell movie, only to discover that I was completely, happily wrong! THE REEDS is actually a chilling ghost story w/ tons of dread, foreboding, and doom! The twisty finale is the black icing on the whole rancid cake! Definitely one of the better AFTER DARK films..."
2,Boring but atmospheric. Wasted potential.,"When I saw previews for this film, I thought it may have been based on Algernon Blackwood's short story The Willows. I was excited, but quickly became bored. The film is little more than the same ""kill the cast"" flicks of which you have seen entirely too many.The setting is lovely (the Broads are a joy), and the thought of being lost in a sea of reeds is bound to bring out fear, but I wound up fast-forwarding in the hopes that something would catch my eye and tell me what was going on.SPOILER ALERT. The ""reveal"" doesn't really reveal much. The killer is told to kill by the ghosts, but that makes no sense. No explanation that I saw said why he killed the kids in the first place. So it is a chicken and the egg kind of thing. Makes no sense, has no significant plot, and the very end, where everything seems to go back in time and the woman's eyes turn black, makes no sense either. I was really disappointed."
2,"Starts out slow, and goes nowhere","UK import The Reeds marks another foreign release for this year's lineup of the After Dark Horrorfest, but compared to Lake Mungo and Hidden, this is sadly the worst. The Reeds follows a group of friends who run afoul of some very disturbing goings-on along the river. Equal parts slasher and ghost story, The Reeds starts out slow and proceeds to go nowhere, plodding along while throwing one incomprehensible story element at you after another. It doesn't take long to realize The Reeds is going nowhere fast, although the film is sort of strangely compelling, just to see what direction things are going to take in terms of what horror sub-genre the film is going to scrape up against next. The ending is mind-boggling and kind of lame, and while The Reeds isn't abysmal, there isn't anything worth mentioning about it either."
3,SPOOKY REEDS,A new entry in the Horrorfest series boosted by a creepy atmosphere and solid acting. Three couples off for a weekend of celebration find themselves confronting a supernatural presence and meeting grisly deaths.It's all been done hundreds of times before and the twist at the end a little contrived but it's an entertaining ghost story.
4,"Confusing, But Good.","After Reading All of the neagtive Reviews, I Figured, that i would not like this movie, but i was wrong. It is a Really good movie. Like with most After Dark Films, Some Parts Didn't make a whole lot of sense, but i looked over it, and enjoyed it. I hate when people Critisize, movies for being ""Unrealistic"" Come On, It is a Movie. MAKE BElIEVE. Lighten Up, and have a little Fun. This made a great addition, to my collection."
3,"Enticing, though it does call for suspended reality","Enticing, with interesting twists that kept me avidly reading and guessing up to the end. But I don't give it more than three stars because I agree with other reviewers that you have to suspend reality a lot to read this book. The investigating police officer and even Chris's husband were violating law enforcement ethics and possibly jeopardizing the case when it comes to trial by allowing Chris access to crime scenes and sharing case information with her. Also I thought Chris lowered her own ethical and moral standards in this book by withholding information because the daughter asked her to do so. And why was Chris so gullible that she would travel all over the country with someone that she barely knew? The basic premise of these Chris Bennett Brooks stories is getting worn out - she isn't the ex-nun, housewife/mother, and part-time teacher any longer. She's really now a private investigator, so why not remake her into that role?"
2,Disappointed,"beautiful product, came when I expected, but wife and I are disappointed....way too small to be an anklet (and my wife is little, except where it counts!) won't make it around her ankle... very disappointed that this is advertised as an anklet..."
2,A decent sub will cost you at least $350,"I received this subwoofer as a gift after my JBL 12"" subwoofer went bad. Although I appreciated the gift, it is not a good sub for a large basement home theater. It is too small and does not provide deep base. If you just want to add some base to an inexpensive set of satellite speakers this may be the sub for you. However, its size and depth do not compare to its more expensive competitors."
2,Great subwoofer but it did not last.,"For the price you simply cannot beat it; however, the quality is lacking. It died after only three years of usage. My father was right- when it comes to a stereo system, go for the quality. Highly quality items will last you longer and give you more enjoyment."
4,for the money you can't go wrong,"great mid to low bass frequency response phase switch,volume control and variable crossover switch all work well has auto power switch. Great value for the money"
2,Did not last long,"This sub sounded OK in my small apartment but after about a year it stopped working, i took it apart and part of the circuit board on the internal amp was burned. obviously is was not very high quality."
2,Weak Pride card,"Of the modern Pride era this is possibly one of the most lackluster events I have seen. All but two of the fights on the card are dull affairs. Little action and results that have no consequence as far as the future of the fighters concerned characterize 6 of the 8 fights. However, two fights stand out as quality fights. Randleman vs Ninja features ""the Monster"" turning Rua's right eye into roast beef. A pleasant sight to watch. The main event of Nogueira vs Henderson is a highly technical affair with great suspense as Henderson amazingly escapes submission after submission. Overall, however, a poor card that leaves one asking, ""Is that it?"""
3,High Expectations,"With a title like A Girl Like Ghe Guevara, I have to admit, I had high expectations. Unfortunately, the book did not live up to them. At one point, I found myself saying, ""Okay, I'll give it 50 more pages, and if it doesn't get better, then I'll stop."" Luckily, it did get a little better and I was able to settle in and to finish the novel.One thing that I did like was that it gave me an opportunity to see Communist Cuba from the point of view of a young niave Cuban girl, and that was interesting. Somehow Lourdes (the main character) was able to remain fairly positive considering everything that she saw and endured. That was a nice testament to the resiliance of the teenage spirit.In all, I think once I accepted that the book wasn't going to be what I had expected, I was able to enjoy it.On a more positive note: the characters were well done (though some too stereotypical) and the author did a great job in depicting the other-than-ideal society in which these people lived."
4,Good value,"For the number of hex keys you get, this is a pretty good value. They're pretty sturdy and I didn't have any issues with the case. However, I took one star off because my set was missing the 0.9mm wrench. Not a huge deal to me as I'm unlikely to need one that small, but it's still discouraging that I didn't receive the full set."
5,Very Pleased,A very nice set of Allen wrenches. All fit well in the case and the case snaps shut solidly. I bought the set for the very small wrenches that were included and they worked well. A very good value for what you get.
2,Many Sizes - Poor Storage,"I agree with the previous reviewer. The multitude of sizes is terrific - the case is an abomination. Most of the little plastic tabs that hold the keys in place were broken off on arrival. Several more have broken since I started using the set. This makes it impossible to use the case to keep the keys organized. If you purchase this set, plan on devising an alternate means to store the keys."
3,Like everyone else said...,"Good set, really really lousy case. Case was broken on arrival. It's a piece of plastic, couldn't they have splurged 2 cents and made it extra-nice?I bought this set pretty much exclusively for the smallest hex keys, they are somewhat hard to find, but I broke one of them just taking it out of the box - it's not that they are badly made, it's just that they are too thin to be practical, if you need a key this small, I would suggest just drilling out the set screw or using tweezers to screw it in, there is no way a hex key that small can do the job.Conclusion: I'd buy it again, it's a good set for the price."
5,Awesome joke gift,However the jokes on me because my hubby out them all over my fridge! Very funny though! Would totally buy this again for a cat lover
4,Cat butts,"We have an on going gag giving out ridiculous cat gifts. This, by far, was the most ridicolus. Hil.ar.ious. &#128049;"
5,Ten Years of Violet Days,"This is a great book for adults who have enjoyed her comics. Also check out her unique children's books: ""Monkey with a Toolbelt"". They are fantastic."

3,"On ""I Used to Love Her""","People, people--""I Used to Love Her"" is NOT about killing and burying a girlfriend, it's about putting down and burying a dog. The word that in clean contexts means ""female dog,"" but which is usually used as a derogatory word for women, takes its literal meaning in this song. That's the joke. That having been said, it isn't a very funny joke.As for my review, I bought this album a long time ago for ""Patience,"" but rarely listen to the whole thing, since it sounds just like what it is--a cobbled-together album to keep the group in the spotlight. And I do object to ""One in a Million."" This album is pretty much for completists only."
5,a look to the future,I first heard this album when i was round a mates back in '92 a week later i had all of them this album has everything from passion to hate if you've never heard it before then i advise you to buy this album even if it's just for the classic 'patience' which will go down in history along with the controversial 'one in a million' well worth it's money
2,Can't Compare,"This was a dissapointing follow up to their first album. Most of the songs are acoustic and a lot duller than any track on ""Appetite For Destruction"". Buy it if you're a die-hard Axl worshipper, otherwise leave it be."
1,Not good at all,"I must first admit that I only marginally like GNR as a band. Even with that being the case there is really not anything to like about this. I suppose Patience is a pretty pleasant tune, and I will throw it on every once in a long while. However I really can't stand most of the material on here. Mama Kin is the worst butchering of a classic I have ever heard. Even for fans of the band, don't expect ""Use Your Illusion"" or ""Appetite For Destruction."" This band was not meant to release those albums ever again, they burnt out as quick as they arrived."
2,Skrwedriver?!?,"Wow! It is awesome that GNR did a cover of the Skrewdriver song ""One in a Million"" . I am not a fan of GNR, but that is really cool and I have a little more respect for'em now! 88"
3,,"value for the money. enjoyable, convenient, easy to use, i like to use this app on a regular basis for fun."
3,Could have been better,"It was an okay CD. Still G 'N' R is a bit more intense than what I usually go for, but not bad. This CD was typical because I found a few songs were good but as a whole it seemed unbalanced. But as would later be revealed, Axl is a bit more out there than most other ""artists""."
5,Raw guitar playing,"I think this album is as raw as it gets and i love it half of the album is live and the other half is studio its great guitar work in my books.One in a million has great guitar work but one thing i hate about it is the lyrics very immature,very ignorant and very racist. I think the lyrics ruined that song. I hate racism period!!! And i cant believe slash let those lyrics fly i would of quit the band after my band wanted to play dirt like that.Other than that great guitar album slash and izzy and duff you guys are great musicians."
4,"Not Bad, Could've Been Better","Lies is a pretty good album but not the masterpiece some reviewers claim. It wasn't designed with much thought, just thrown together quickly as a way to buy time between the eventual mega success of Appetite for Destruction and the ""difficult second album"" Use Your Illusion I and II. That said, most of it is pretty good. Out of the four live songs, the cover of Aerosmith standard ""Mama Kin"" is great, and the rest are adequate.The new acoustic songs fare better. ""Patience,"" as we all know, is a masterpiece, and many have bought the album for it alone.""Used to Love Her"" is fun though not too riveting. ""One in a Million"" is great, with biting lyrics that can be taken out of context. ""You're Crazy"" was much better on Appetite.This is not essential, but you probably should get it anyway since we may never see any new material from the original band."
2,Not a Favorite of mine,"The questionable lyrics on ""One In a Million"" and the mediocrecover of Aerosmiths Mama Kin are really downers for me. Noreally standout tracks here. Not such an impressive effort.Keep the racist stuff to yourself Mr.Axel you hypocrite moron."
2,A Weak Effort!,"After releasing the widely successful album ""Appettite For Destruction"", which featured the hit single ""Sweet Child O' Mine"", I thought Guns N' Roses would attempt to take a step foward musically with their follow-up album. To my amazement, Guns N' Roses actually took a step backward. A huge one! G N' R Lies will disappoint anyone who appreciated Guns N' Roses material off their two most successful albums, ""Use Your Illusion I"", and of course ""Appettite For Destruction"". I honestly can say that this album is near terrible. It does not feature any hit singles, videos, or any really good songs, like all the successful Guns N' Roses albums do. I advise people not to purchase this album, and I encourage them to focus more on buying the better Guns N' Roses albums, ""Use Your Illusion I"", and ""Appettite For Destruction""."
5,"Don't Listen to the Lies, Buy this Album","GN'R Lies is often unfortunately overlooked because of it's controversy and a misunderstanding of the album's purpose. The so-called lyrics of bigotry in ""One in a Million"" are taken out of context with the rest of the song, which is actually sarcastic and satirical and focuses on self-hate more than the hatred of others. Also, don't fool yourself: this album was a filler to tide the fans over between Appetite and their next work (which happened to be the Illusion albums). Fans should buy this only if they already have the three major albums and are looking for something extra. However, as a little something extra, Lies is a great album and true gunners should find that it hits the bullseye. By the way, Axl is working on new stuff, as he has been for a few years and he entered the studio late '98. Supposedly it is more techno. I'm there, man!"
3,Lies is a good album for true GNR fans only,"""Lies is a 2 part album. The first half was recorded in 1986 before ""Appetite"". The second half was recorded in 1988. The first half is just a bunch of early GNR live thrashings. It is ok, but nothing great here. The second half is pretty good. ""I Used To Love Her, But I Had To Kill her"" is a darkly funny song, it is your basic GNR dark style. There is a remake of ""Your Crazy"" off the ""Appetite album. It has been slowed down. The best song on the album is ""Patience"". This is a great song that makes the entire album worthwhile. The last song on the album is ""One In a Million"". It is an ok song but very offensive. This album is for die hard Guns N Roses fans only.Nate Dusek"
4,"Un disco con pocos temas, pero muy bueno.","Si sos fanatico de GNR es un disco muy bueno, pero no muy extenso (33 min. aprox.). Son 8 temas: los 4 primeros en vivo y los otros 4 acusticos (incluye You're Crazy de Appetite... en version acustica). Si quieres escuchar a GNR cuando comenzaba a ser conocido, te recomiendo los temas en vivo, reeditados dentro de este disco debido a que se incluyeron en un primer EP (Live Like!?@ a Suicide) del cual solo se hicieron unas miles de copias y luego de agotarse, se vendian por muchos $$$, haciendo imposible que los fanaticos sin poder adquisitivo puedan escucharlos. Los temas acusticos son un complemento para nada despreciable. Es un disco recomendable."
3,Patience,Patience is one of the best song I have ever listen to. Sorry for Gn'r fans but the rest is just 'ok'.
3,"Not a good Cd, but a couple good songs","This is really not that great of a CD. Used to love her, and You are crazy are great songs but the rest are essentially filler. On that, I would award this CD 2 stars. However, Patience is found on this CD. That elevates the CD up to barely a 3."
3,Get Appitite for destruction first!!,"Well it's good but not great. Truley I would not pay the price fo it as the other ones are so much better. The first 4 songs Axl's voice is HIGH and very sqeeked. The Acustic songs are what would give it a couple of extra stars as they sing Patiance, One in a million, Used to love her and the acustic version of your crazy. Well buy it when it's cheap so long. Die hard GnR fan."
4,Can one use it on a gas range too?,The reviews here have made me want to buy this pan but what I really need is a pan that will work both in an oven and on a gas range. Has anyone used it on a gas range? How does it stand up to an open flame? Thank you.
5,Just Great,"I've been looking for the perfect boiler pan for simply ever. Forgive my lapse of english. It was just impossible to find until I found this Chicago Metallic Professional Roast N' Broil brolier pan. Beware, you cannot broil a turkey in this pan, but since I would never want to do so, that is not a problem. I LOVE IT. It is perfect."
4,used a couple times,This is a small roasting pan perfect for a chicken. It cleaned quickly & easily.
4,Not quite as good as they used to be,"I had 1 of these pans about 7 years ago - they are nice and rigid, so stay stable in the oven. They cook nice and evenly [baking] & the non-stick's not bad. The recent purchase I made for a friend, appears to have a much thinner non-stick coating which has a rougher feel to it. In my experience of non-stick, this will prove to be less effective while baking, however roasting should not be an issue. It may be that my original was made in a different factory/country or with a better grade of finish."
1,So much for NONSTICK!,"This pan, billed as non-stick and broiler safe, is neither apparently. I followed the packaging instructions and washed it before using. I used it to broil pork chops and when I pulled the pan from the oven, I found the meat drippings fossilized on the bottom of the pan.I've been soaking it in water for 8 hours now, and the drippings are STILL stuck on the bottom. I also noticed that the nonstick surface is already scratched off the bottom of this pan.I am not impressed. In fact, I'm deeply disappointed in this product."
3,ok sword,the blade was a little loose on the handle and if you grab the blade you can move the handle back and forth. the paint job was kinda crappy but that is easily fixed and thats about it. but if you want a good Blade sword for cheep go for this one.
2,A very inferior sequel to Aztec,"Aztec Autumn suffers, like many sequels, by comparison to its predecessor, Aztec. One has the strong impression that the author knocked off this tome for one and only one reason: money. While the previous novel was impressive for the obviously immense research done to complete it, Aztec Autumn relies on implausible plot twists, magic, and the author's obvious prejudices for its effect. A fatal flaw is the author's choice of a mass murderer as a hero; any reader with a sense of justice begins rooting against the ""hero"" soon into the novel. Still, there is a certain amount of history interspersed with the author's prejudices, and fans of Aztec may want to read this mercifully short book just to get it out of their system."
3,Why Sequels Never Surpass the Original,"Gary Jennings' AZTEC was a stunning epic of blood and gore - a fascinating study of the fall of the Aztec empire told in first person from an ""eye witness"". Unfortunately, this much awaited sequel, AZTEC AUTUMN, is not as well thought-out as the first book. The story is formulaic in the now familiar Gary Jennings style (see JOURNEYER and RAPTOR) - the hero loses his virginity at an early age; experiments with incest; brags about being uncircumcised; and has sex with first - the great love of his life (who always dies) and secondly - with the second great love (who always dies). I'm sorry but I loved Jennings' JOURNEYER and AZTEC, but it's hard to forgive the blatancy of his formula in AZTEC AUTUMN - the roots are showing! Clearly AZTEC AUTUMN is just a retread of the far better earlier book - but is sorely lacking in a re-write or two to make the reader overlook how systematic is his formula."
2,A Major Letdown,"In Aztec, Jennings came close to producing a modern prose epic,a panoramic picture of an infinitely interesting, sadly vanishedculture. Aztec Autumn, unfortunately, cannot measure up to the earlier effort. If Jennings had had more artistic sense, he wouldn't have released it, but there were probably so much pressure from his publishers and his literary agent that he couldn't help but try to cash in on his earlier success. The most telling weakness of this novel is Jennings' reliance on gratuitous sex scenes to keep the story moving. This device was beginning to wear on me in Journeyer, but by this stage it is beyond banal, and I am by no means a prude. He was simply running out of ideas, so he succombed to the Harold Robbins school of best-sellers. If you want to read a truly dumbed-down version of Aztec (one of the greatest ""reads"" of all time) fork over your money for this one."
4,"exciting, thrilling, informative","Perhaps it took to much time to write another chapter in the ancient Aztec's life, but I think this book and the original one: Aztec, are a very good way to learn more about the Aztec history. This book provides a lot of information of the culture, traditions, religion, behavior, strengths and weakness of the ancient Aztecs in a very understandable way. Also, it let the reader understand the reasons why any culture would try to stop a foreigner attack, even if that means loosing their own life. Written simply and in a novel way, it's easier to read than a History Book."
2,What's the point?...,"After reading Aztec, The Journier and Raptor, I eagerly awaited the next blast of historic splendor. And then came Aztec Autumn. How terribly disappointing... What's the point? A money maker? Probably. Aztec sold well so Aztec Autum should sell even better ... Nay, Sir Jennins. Give your readers what they want. We want the details. The wonderful horrible details, the friends the enemies...this book lacked. To Mr. Jennings, next book, take your time. Your readers love and respect your style and eagerly await your next real book."
3,Well Researched Historical Novel,"The plot is a bit of a disappointment, especially the *very* unlikely coincidences, but the research into Mexico's history and the telling of the tale of colonization from the aboriginal inhabitants' perspective makes this novel well worth the effort to read it."
3,"Good Book, must read first one first to like this one","This is a good work of fiction that is based in fact. The whole idea of the second rebellion is interesting especially of the alliance of many tribes. Read Aztec first, then pick up this jewel. I kiss the earth to that."
2,Nothing comparable to the Aztec,"It is always a difficult task to write a sequel of a successful book. But also taking into account this kind of difficulty, I didn't like very much that one. Of course it is a readable novel (Jennings is an expert writer), but all the epic and historical backgrounds I found in the Aztec, has been currently lost. It is an average work, and any interest it can retain, derives, in my opinion, only by the sound of the original subject. I would have expected much more by the author of the Aztec."
2,Gratuitous disappointment,"This book was such a disappointment after Aztec. The story was predictable and silly; the plot was thin, dialogue thinner. In one representative portion the hero is shipwrecked on an island of nubile, female pearl divers who are annually raped by traders-- the hero introduces them to the pleasure of his ""tepuli"". You get the picture. After the tour de force we read in Aztec this book was trivial and silly."
1,A Disservice to the Memory of Gary Jennings,"This book would never have been published had Gary Jennings been alive to prevent it. It is obvious that someone controlling his papers--notes, outlines, partial writing of a projected novel--sought to make money out of his incomplete work by completing it for him and doing a miserable job of it. Jennings himself was so meticulous an author in every regard that he would have been embarrassed to have his name associated with this piece of trash.It is to be hoped that someone else, someone up to the task, was hired to use Jennings's papers to create Aztec Blood."
2,A dissapointing book,"Aztec was one of the most entertaining and engaging books that I have read in the last few years. The story was gripping, the characters were somewhat believable, and it was a real page-turner. Aztec Autumn, on the other hand, was completely dissapointing and sort of felt like it had been strung together by a computer program which pulled out elements of Aztec and then strung heavy-handed plots around them. Very little in Aztec Autumn seemed surprising or inspiring, and the narrative voice did not capture my attention the way it did in the original. It's hard to tell if a sequel like this, actually written by the author, is worse than one of those sequels written after the author died, by some hopeful writer obsessed with making a quick buck. One of the things that was great about Aztec was that it told a finite life story, but this book just dragged the story on in an unoriginal manner."
3,"Clever in its story line, disapointing in the delivery.","Aztec was a superb piece of literature. A great ride through the life of the Aztec nation. Aztec Autumn lacks the personality and depth of it's prequal. The final chapter is the biggest let down. It is just a narration of what should have been the biggest battle of the book. I agree with several others who have reviewed this book, sequals just don't carry the same passion as the original."
1,In support of the author ....,"and the astounding first book, Aztec, i bought this book and amazingly finished reading it.Aztec Autumn should have been called Aztec winter since most of Jennings masterfull artistry has not only numbed but one would venture say has been frozen.Whereas in Aztec we find Mixtili the hero that one can identify with, while in Autumn the hero has few of the noble albeit violent traits and can actually be considered as probably the dumbest and luckiest of the Aztecs.It almost became omical while reading of his simplistic plots to kill Spaniards the idiot invariably was found out and usually foiled.And darn if there wasn't also an abundance of man hating women in this crowd of strange characters ... Quite unlike the Aztecs and totally missing from the first of Jennings books....Ok so I paid my dues in forking over the bucks for this book but Jennings the next one you publish I'll be a lot more carefull"
4,aztec autumn,"not quite as good as the original aztec but worth the read.aztec autumn tells the story of a young man named tenamaxtin who plans to fight the spanish and kick them out of the land they supposedley conquered.its a book of gore, sex, and murder but done better than most books with these ingredients.first read the original aztec then read this one."
3,"Not Aztec, but readable","After I read Aztec, I was like WOW.. So I instantly bought this book. I started reading it and put it down.. I was not impressed.. Perhaps I expected too much... A year later I read this book in one week. It was an okay book, but seemed like it was done for money! Aztec was brilliant, this was just ok!"
3,Where is the character build-up?,"If you read ""Aztec"", then you know how brilliantly Jennings wrote his story, which was interwoven beautifully with extensive character background. This applies not only to the protagonist, but to many other individuals floating in and out of his life. ""Aztec Autumn"" has only a smattering of this, as well as the technique involving a ""what goes around comes around"" motif, with characters and events coming back to bite Mixtli in the, well, you know. It's probably due to the brevity of the book itself that disallowed it, but I would think a writing style as successful as the one used in it's predecessor was greatly missed, and was sorely needed. I, too, enjoyed ""Aztec"" and ""Journeyer"" (haven't gotten to ""Raptor"" yet), and I was looking forward to diving into ""Aztec Autumn"". The ""5"" rating says that it had the right elements, but it needed more of the right elements (character development, length, intertwined storyline, etc.)"
5,"A wonderful story, intricately woven.","I loved this book. It was the first book of this author I have read, and I will definitely read more of his work. Although it reminds me of the book River God, Aztec Autumn is not as vivid. A great read for people who love history and a great plot. It reveals the horrors inflicted on native peoples by the Spanish conquistadors, and helps you see it from there point of view."
3,Aztec Autumn,"Book was a fairly good read, however, Jennings seems to be trying to recapture the success of his earlier book, ""Aztec"", rather than create a new and original story. At times it seems as though both characters are the same person, rather than father and son. The new character, Tenamixtli, seems to be just an updated version of his father, Mixtli, from the original Aztec. Jenning should have made more effort to give Tenamixtli his own unique personality.All in all, the book was entertaining, but lacked the character developement that made ""Aztec"" the page turner that it was."
3,great beginning,The book starts out very interesting but gets a bit boring with too much detail. Also too much detail on sex for a book that I wanted mostly for the historical facts.
3,Typos!!!,"I'm mainly writing this review in regards to the many, many typos I found in the Kindle edition. Don't know if the original book is scanned and the errors come from poor scanning or what, but it was difficult to read this book because of the typos. I've noticed this in other Kindle books, but this one seemed to have an extreme number of typos. Not sure what can be done about it, but it should be looked into.The book itself was good, not nearly as complex as Aztec, but still a good read."
2,A TEDIOUS SIMPLE TALE,"THIS SHORT, SIMPLE TALE IS TYPICAL OF LAWRENCE. A MARRIED MAN--A MUSICIAN-- UNHAPPY IN HIS MARRIAGE, HAS AN AFFAIR WITH HIS STUDENT. THEN HE CANNOT FACE HIS FAMILY AND COMMITS SUICIDE. AFTER HIS SUICIDE, LIFE GOES ON. HIS FAMILY SUCCEED WITHOUT HIM, AND HIS YOUNG MISTRESS FINDS ANOTHER MAN TO LOVE HER.ITS IS SIMPLE AND PREDICTABLE. THE BULK OF THE PIECE DESCRIBES THE DAYS IN WHICH THE LOVERS SPEND SOME DAYS TOGETHER, ALONE, AT THE SEASHORE, ENJOYING LOVE AND NATURE. IT IS BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN, BUT I FOUND IT TIRESOME AFTER A WHILE. LAWRENCE WRITES NOVELS OF PURE POETRY, BUT THE TALE DID NOT KEEP ME INTERESTED. IF I WANT POETRY, I'LL READ IT!"
5,I'd give it 10 stars if I could!,"I adored this book! It was a gripping read, and I could not put it down! It was such a page turner that I lost many nights sleep just to finish this truly ADDICTING novel. Run, dont't walk, to your nearest bookstore and pick this treasure up as quick as you possibly can!"
3,what happened?,"I hate to give this album 3 measly stars but there's nothing I can do but be brutally honest. I just wonder what happened to the Crows I fell in love with. Their entire vibe changed with the release of this and has caused controversy amoung their fans.True, many feel betrayed by the pop-ness of the songs but Adam Duritz's lyrics are still touching and wonderful. The music isn't as morose as it has been on previous albums but bands, like the people in them, change.All I can say is that I was disappointed by this but it has it's good points. Don't start here, instead, build up to it."
4,I can't stop listening...even though I want to,"Okay that sounds ridiculous. But every time I switch albums on my CD player, I keep coming back to this record. Like some folks said before, this CD goes down easy and grows on you. The songs are significantly better and more polished than the tracks on This Desert Life. It feels like they got their groove back. My favorite track is Miami. But I wonder why radio hasn't picked up the song Up All Night. That's as good a song as, if not better than, Goodnight Elizabeth."
1,Listen First,"I have all the crows ablums in my collection. I bought this one without listening to it first.VERY BAD MOVE!!!I would say that they have soldout, but then again, they have always fit into the center of mainstream pop. But, my attraction to them came with the soulfulness and truth of the music. I liked them in spite of their popularity.Like them no more. This disc is overproduced, overwrought garbage. It takes some particularly pungent aspects of eighties music and forms it into a CD of concentrated trash. I can't understand why so many people rate this ablum highly.The big struggle here is that I can't even respect their direction. It's one thing to be experiemental (a la Kid A of Radiohead or even Zooropa for U2). But this is just a big ole' sell out. There I said it. It's sellout. It is one of the most poppy bands in America selling what's left of their musical dignity to sell more ablums.I guess the Crows have grown up. They have a mature sound in all of the worst ways."
2,Devastated,"""We all want to be big stars, but we don't know why and we don't know how... Mr. Jones and me, we're gonna be big stars...."" CC has been a glorious shining star far above the usual routine rock bands. No longer. The band has sold out to the producers and degraded to pop trash. Shame on you Adam! Gone are the soul-searching lyrics and ""rough around the edge"" guitar licks. What we have here is overproduced, predictable, routine, dull, mainstream, candy-coated electro bop. I suppose Adam decided he could become a ""big star"" by foregoing his incredible talent to appeal to the common denominator. If you are new to CC please buy August and Everything After."
1,i just don't get it,"I enjoy ""august"" and ""desert life"" but this one is a bore. Its incredibly generic. With the exception of the song ""good time"", this album lacks everything that made Counting Crows a good band."
2,"My enamel ain't hard enuff, Captain!","Food for thought: in the time it took Da Crows to progress from ""August and Everything After"" (which I still think is a masterful record and one of -- drumroll, please -- The Best Debuts of All-Time) to this Middle-of-the-Road (right there next to that flattened, festering skunk) Bland-o-thon, The Beatles went from ""Please Please Me"" to ""Abbey Road""....AIN'T THESE GRAND TIMES WE LIVE IN, KIDS?!?!"
2,"Not a horrible album, but not up to Crows' calibur","Hard Candy is sweet enough for some, but will leave a bad aftertaste for many. I'm not suggesting you not buy it - I'll still buy their next one - just know what you're getting into. This album finds the band exploring just about every sound except the one that it's good at, and Adam singing his same melodies, just changing the emphasis from song to song. If this were anyone else, it would just be an average album, but coming from CC it's dissapointing. A lot of bands have trouble growing and staying commercially viable at the same time, and I think CC has thus far accomplished this with a creative juice that has consistently blown me away. However, Hard Candy seems like a project that was phoned in. It's the sound of a band no longer deeply in touch with its music, but rather bored by it."
3,I hate to see them Fall!!,"I loved CC the minute I listened to them. I was crazy about every word Adam uttered in their previous Albums. But I think something is wrong here with Hard Candy. The lyrics have never been that shallow and rather expected. They are still good, but comparing to CC standards, lyrics are a drawback in this album. They usually have a tighter control over their music. In HArd Candy, Adam's voice struggled with the background and the final result was a cuios.I still recommend this CD, cause I hate to see this beautiful band fall!!"
2,I want to like this album....,"I really do. But after months of listening, its just not taking. I own everything the crows have released and about 20 boots they didnt. As a songwriter, Ive worshipped Adam Duritz. And I feel like as a fan, Ive really grown with the band through their first three albums and been right there with them, but this-- this is mediocre at best. If it werent Counting Crows, theres NO WAY I'd have even considered buying it. I certainly wouldnt have put so much effort into trying to enjoy it. Sadly, I think the love affair is over. ""Hard Candy"" squeaks out a few moments that shimmer, but its mostly weak tunes that are overproduced propping up a collection of throwaway lyrics. Eek, its enough to make you cry."
3,A little disappointed....,Sounds a little contrived. The ballads are very boring and similar to earlier albums.
5,"Took a few listens, but I'm hooked","This album definitely has a different feel than their previous ones, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. It has a slightly more mainstream ""pop"" sound, but the sophisticated listener can still pick up on the subtleties that make Counting Crows a brilliant band."
2,Yawn.... it is really as groundbreaking as they say?,"I must be the odd man out. I eagerly awaited the release of this CD, as I have all of the other CC discs. I own everything they've released and have been a big fan.... However, I'm not sure that this CD is such a marked departure from the previous efforts, except perhaps it's their most commercially viable CD yet. Each song sounds like a crafted radio tune. I think the music is ""good,"" but far from spectacular. Given their brilliance on August... and Recovering... this CD is a grave disappointment - not because it's musically different, because it feels like yet another creative band selling out and directing their music further away from creativity and closer to pop success.Overall, it's a fair CD, but those of us that are die hard CC fans have come to expect a great deal more than a ""fair"" CD from this band. I am gravely disappointed and consider this a very weak effort, at best."
1,Enough already!,"The Counting Crows are perhaps the blandest band ever put on the radio besides Dave Matthews and REM. Their music is for rich, spoiled, poetry-obsessed upper-class college kids!All this band does is whine about how sad they are about girls- makes me sick! I don't know how anyone considers this ""rock""- u wanna hear ""rock""? Pick up ""Dirt"" by Alice in Chains!"
1,COPY PROTECTED CD! Don't buy for MP3 Player,"Great album, but I have to give it one star because of the copy protection. I BOUGHT the album. WHY can't I copy a file to the MP3 player I use at the gym and when I travel! Don't tell me it's because others illegally file share. If the record label is going to restrict the use of the music CD they should be required to disclose it BEFORE you buy it. THIS CD IS GOING BACK!"
1,A very disappointing effort,"But this one back in my car stereo as part of paring back my CD collection and was reminded both what a good album ""August and Everything After"" is and what a bad album this is. This is one that is clearly going into the donate box without even bothering to burn any of the tracks to my computer. Do not pass Go! Do not collect $200!"
2,What do you do with hard candy?,"Suck it! That's the sentiment I gathered from the band after listening to this album. The music is mediocre, polished with just one or two fairly bright spots. I was drawn to this album upon seeing names like Ethan Johns, Ryan Adams and Leona Naess listed in the credits. I was hoping they could save the Crows from churning out another soulless record, but I was let down. This one is going up for resale."
1,It's a long time since August...,"And a very, very long time since ""Mr.Jones"". The band tries hard with ""American Girls"", but even at its best it's only a so-so Counting Crows track. The remainder of the album is mostly embarrassing, almost veering into Barry Manilow territory. The album hits its lowest point on tracks like ""Miami"", and is bafflingly inept on ""New Frontier"". On the strength of these songs I really wouldn't be surprised to see Counting Crows opening in Vegas very soon. They've already morphed into a lounge act on this album."
5,Hard Candy....different but Good!!!,"I've been able to listen to this album about four times now, and I like it more with each listen. It's definetely the kind of album where you will have to listen to some of the songs twice before you really begin to appreciate them. Adam Duritz is still a songwriting genious and it shows on Hard Candy. Butterfly in Reverse is kind of a strange song, but still pretty good....My favorite on the album is actually ""If I could give all my love to you or Richard Manuel is Dead"". Carriage and Holiday in Spain are also awesome. There is no denying that American Girls has great ""hit"" potential for the radio....but I hope ""Hard Candy"" is the next single because I feel it has great radio potential also. There's actually several on this album that they could easily have good success with as radio singles.I highly reccomend Hard Candy to everyone!! Now if only Zwan(Billy Corgan's new band) would release their album already...."
4,"Steady as a rock, these guys...","I had heard their version of ""Big Yellow Taxi"" in an elevator or somewhere (really). After buying the CD and listening to it on a good sound system, I was blown away. Best arrangement of the song I've ever heard, and I can only hope that Joni would be pleased. I love these guys, they are unique in a non-unique world, the song about Spain and bottles of booze and shoes says it all....."
4,Really Good,"I really enjoy this cd. It's got a lot of variety, good lyrics and really interesting musical styles (it does a lot of interesting things with percussion and horn instruments and pop mixed with really mellow rock). I think that Hard Candy is a really great song. Also, the bests are American Girls and Butterfly in Reverse which has a very very infectious melody. Overall, I think that they are a good solid band."
3,"Pretty good, not great","I think it's not as good as the last one. In some places it sounds like they're on automatic pilot.Still, any album by CC always contains a number of enjoyable songs."
4,Still Good,"For a CD I don't feel is Counting Crow's best effort, this is still a really good album and brings lots of listening enjoyment. Everyone had heard their cover of ""Big Yellow Taxi"" which is a very strong song, but not the best on the album. Even the debut single from this album, ""American Girl"" is only average for this disc. Great for any Counting Crows fan."
4,Another solid outing,"HARD CANDY continues Counting Crows cycle of catchy songs with heart on the sleeve lyrics and singing by Adam Duritz. The band is very tight on this one and Duritz is in a more controlled space as he keeps a check on his emoting, letting the lyrics carry the songs instead of his vocalizing. The band stays true to form throughout with songs of relationships, both good and bad, and lyrics that reflect some truths about the way we live. A Counting Crows fan shouldn't be disappointed here and for anyone who likes their rock, thoughtful and melodic, this is a fine example."
4,"GOOD BUT NOT AS ""AUGUST""... OF COURSE !!!","Counting crows is definitely a good band but I'm afraid that they will never make another masterpiece like ""August and everything after"". If you already like the Crows, you will like this album which is, for me, maybe better than ""Desert Life"".Anyway, ""Up all night""(track 12) is one very VERY good song and deserves to be heard..."
5,Hard Candy is Sweet!,"If you have yet to purchase the latest release form Counting Crows, ""Hard Candy"" let me encourage you to do so. It is filled with enjoyable melodies, with slighty edgier feel to it.CC have really pulled out all the stops, touching every point of the musical spectrum.With Charging Guitar rifts and Whimsical Piano, Hard Candy is Sweet!"
3,No bitter taste,"Counting Crows have returned with a solid record. There are a number of amazing songs. ""Up All Night,"" ""Holiday in Spain,"" ""New Frontier,"" ""Good Time,"" and ""Why Should You Come When I Call"" make this album worth buying. All those songs are great and probably better than anything that was on This Desert Life.It is difficult to believe the Counting Crows have been around for ten years already. They have some great songs. The best of collection Films about Ghosts is a great way to be introduced to their catalog. Lead singer Adam Duritz has established himself as a great songwriter and hopefully he continues to write as long as people are willing to listen."
3,It's Just the Same Hard Candy You're Remembering Again,"This is another good album by Duritz & Co. Unfortunately, however, I don't think this one has the depth of the previous three records. Some of the more enjoyable songs are relatively shallow, and quite a few tracks are not as well-written as songs on past albums. Nonetheless, I disagree with critics and fans who condemn the band for veering towards a more ""poppy"" sound. I've always maintained that part of what made the Crows so wonderful was their unfaltering artistic independence. Having seen them perform some of the new material for this album live before it was released, it's clear that the group has managed to maintain the passion and beautiful lyricism of past records. However, it's unfortunate that only some of the songs manage to shine brightly. Buy it for the good tracks, but rank it at a definite #4 out of the group's 4 studio albums."
5,A Very Good Time,"When the music industry is surrounding itself with boy and girl bands and too much ""hey you sing this for us to make us all rich"", Counting Crows are back in full swing with their 4th studio album. All the Crows albums to date have their own style and are very different - and so is this one. There are some really good rockin songs on this album like Miami and Up All Night and Holiday in Spain is one of the best Crows songs e ever. This is a non-brainer buy. About time good ole rock-n-roll comes back mainstream! Highly recommended."
3,Hard Candy hits and misses,"First things first, on Hard Candy Duritz fails to create the catchy hooks that he has done on the previous three. Now that that's out of the way, let me commend them on using some very pleasing harmonies. They decided to include the Beach Boys on their influence list rather than just Van Morrison and REM. It seems as though Duritz attempted to trick everyone into thinking that this were all great songs by having guests such as Sheryl Crow, Leona Naess, Matthew Sweet, and Ryan Adams. I'm not saying this a bad album, just not their best. There are definite good spots on this album with Butterfly in Reverse and Holiday in Spain, but overall it hits and misses."
4,Warm and satisfied,"There are very few artists that I await new releases from, and this CD satisfied my thirst for the Crow's voice and thoughts and arrangements. To the negative reviewers: This is folk music, people, a point in time. I especially like ""Butterfly in Reverse"" which reminds me of the Meet Danny Wilson album I loved so much. The harmony on ""Black and Blue"" really sticks with you. It is certainly more pop than ""This Desert Life"", but that is not necessarily a bad thing. Especially if you've sat through ""Mrs. Potter's Lullaby"" a couple of times. Anyway, guys, Good Job!, and hurry back to NYC."
5,A Hidden Masterpiece,"This album, may at first seem to be just a radio friendly pop album, to the uninformed listener, but that just shows the vesatility of the band, they can make a mostly un acoustic album, like this one, and it can be just as amazing lyricly, and musically as an august and everything after, with quotes like ""Cause you've been waiting a long time, to fall down on your knees, cut your hands, cut yourself until you bleed,but fall asleep next to me, and have a dream"", and help by ryan adams make this a intellectually, and mentally challenging album to truly understand. A great choice, for a fan of great music, and great poetry."
1,what were they thinking?,"I truly believe that every song on August and Everything After is a masterpiece. It should be in everyone's top 10 albums of all time. But Hard Candy? Blink and you miss it - the songs are nothing to ooh and aah over. They're okay.. but okay doesn't cut it when you're the Counting Crows and you used to write lyrics like ""there's things I remember and things I forget , I miss you I guess that I should.. Three thousand five hundred miles away...but what would you change if you could?"".... I guess I just expected more. If you're looking for another August, go listen to Pedro the Lion's 'It's hard to find a friend'.... Hard Candy won't do a damn thing for you."
1,not worth the wait,I liked their previous work and read the reviews. It is bland and unimaginative. Why bother?
2,i've tried but this is too slow,"I borrowed this album of a friend and listend to it about 6 times in an attempt to try and like this album but nothing excited me, it was slow, timid and unadventerous. This reminded me of barry manilow as each song was too SLOW. Maye they should attempt an up-beat song."
2,Great band....not so great album,"Counting Crows is the most amazing band i have seen live....they make great cds and preform them even better on stage....this album was not great however,it showed none of the brilliance that was shown on there previous work....all great bands come out with atleast one bad album and i personaly believe this one is it ...borrow it....dont buy it!"
3,"Big Yellow Taxi, and some other stuff","I really enjoyed the August And Everything After album from some years ago, but then lost track of the Counting Crows. However, the Big Yellow Taxi song caught my attention so I picked up this album. That song is my clear favorite here, I'd rate half of the remaining songs as decent, the other half as duds."
3,Not All That Bad,"So, I love Counting Crows. Their first three cd's were excellent, and I fell in love with their music, not to mention Adam Duritz's voice. It has so much character and feeling.That being said, initially I was highly disappointed with Hard Candy. It seemed too pop and main stream oriented. Add that to their tv commercials, and you have a crushed fan. I think the problem was American girls and Big Yellow Taxi biased my opinion. They were too pop. So after about a couple months I took another listen and found to my surprise, I actually enjoyed listening to it. There were quite a few songs I really liked, Black and Blue included. Though a few, American Girls, Big Yellow Taxi, and New Frontier were disappointing, overall, this is a decent cd. It's definitely no where near August and Everything after or the other two, but worth a listen."
5,yummy hard candy,"I love this CD. Listen to it a few times, and you're hooked. it is definately a CD that could find a permanent home in any CD changer. It has that ""your listening to it in a coffee-shoppe"" feel."
4,A striking look into a musician's life,"Incredibly poetic prose. The way Currey writes, the book flows gently but insistently along like a slow country stream. It's a very in depth look at the life and times of a musician. I found myself turning the pages as if I was reading some kind of action/thriller novel. Currey never pushes the story, and it seems as if it all simply unfolds. Great read, and interesting view of the hard life of a musician."
1,dissapointed and nobody to call,I ordered this product and received a different manufacture's edge banding ( band it is the company whose product I received not Freud). I didn't care really who made it as long as I liked it. Well about twenty feet into the roll the glue simply stopped working. I was in the middle of ironing the edge band on a board and half way through it simply stopped being adhesive. I un-rolled another 20 or 30 feet and tried it and it will not stick. I have not been able to contact the seller because ( maybe it's my fault) but I can not find any information regarding who the the seller is. So I am not happy because I received a different name product than what I ordered and it does not work. ( although I was very happy with the first twenty feet or so). I hope to get this resolved but at the moment I do not know who to contact.
3,Thick glue,This Edge banding sticks very well. The glue side is extremely thick and white making it very noticeable that it is edge banding and not solid wood. A thinner wood colored glue would be highly preferred.
1,Wrong Product # (B000HGSS4M),"The order info said, ""Cloud b LullaBag Fleece - Baby Sleep Bag - Large Blue (6-18 months)- Product # B000HGSS4M"". The item received had the same product # on the packaging, but it was a small pink (0-4 months)... listed wrong on Amazon perhaps. Good thing my buddy just had a baby girl."
3,Too much filler information!,"This book covers the basics of this strategy very well; however it contains way too much filler information, and not enough substance. The author treats the reader as a novice to the market; but in reality no stock market novice would even begin to understand this strategy - therefore the author misses his target audience!In my opinion, it is good entry entry-level reading for the market beginner who wants to understand the basics of a hedge fund; however it is not for the seasoned trader demanding greater insight in to a leading-edge strategy."
2,Quality should be inmproved.,"Unfortunately Sylvania 1157A LL/1157NA it is not very good quality. European Philips is much, much better. The light bulb was burned as soon I changed it. Even ""made in china"" is batter. I'll never going to by Sylvania."
1,Blank Photos ruin an expensive book,This is definitely great material. But the paperback edition which i bought new has most of the photographs blank - like cheap failed photocopies. I find that out of order for an expensive book - it seems to me wrong to sell the book in such a state.
5,Awesome book!,Fantastic book that shows the Battle of the Bulge from a side not normally seen - the combat engineers. Great account of the frantic reaction to the German offensive. Highly recommended!
5,Best Bra Ever,"I love this bra!!! It is so comfortable and I don't have to deal with falling straps anymore. I've had a hard time finding ones that fit and this fits so good, I now own three-one in each color. Also, the online price was fantastic. All in all I feel I got a great deal and a fantastic fitwith all the comfort I could ever imagine. Thank you Maidenform!!"
5,GREAT Bra!,I ordered two of these and I just ordered one of each color. This is the most comfortable bra I have ever put on. I absolutely love it. The molded padded push up cups give you a sleek look under tight sweaters and tees. It really is the most comfortable bra I have ever had. Can't wait to get all of my colors!
5,"Fearless Loving, by Rhonda Britten","If you are interested in developing new skills in how to do the relationship dance, this is the book for you. Fearless Loving is a must read. It doesn't matter whether you're currently in relationship, whether you would like to be in a relationship, married, single, recently split up, or divorced. Rhonda has a talent for bringing together concepts and distilling them into bit size, chewable skills for taking action, which most any one of us can implement, given our commitment.This book is a valuable tool for me, personally and for my sixteen year marriage/partnership. I'm finding new ways to really listen, communicate, to set boundaries, to clarify perceptions, to honor my feelings and to play.Fearless Loving also offers an insightful and helpful protocol for people who are interested in a new way to date. I highly recommend this book to my friends and anyone interested in Love."
5,ARE YOU READY FOR CHANGES IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP OR DATING?,"An awesome book for those who are already in a relationship or for those dating. Rhonda tells it how it really is, she doesn't hold back. If you are ready to put passion back into your current relationship or for those dating, then THIS IS THE BOOK for you.Rhonda gives great examples and incorporates many exercises that I have used with my clients and in my own relationship and they work. I highly recommend this book for those who want a sustained change in their relationsip or dating skills."
4,Works well with Canon S50,"I had read somewhere that the Lexar Media Compact Flash HSS was optimized for the Canon S50. I have noticed that it saves files much faster to my S50 than my other brand name CF card. I have had a couple of instances of ""unknown files"" being saved to the card, but I'm not sure if that's a problem with the camera or the card and in any case I haven't lost any photographs.I also use an 'el-cheapo' card reader to unload images into Photoshop Elements and it works great with the Lexar card."
2,"As of 2008, this card is overpriced","This was a great card, but as of Jan. 2008 it is far outperfomed by other cards, but its price has not dropped to reflect this. It is perhaps worth $15."
1,lamp needs replacement in less than 3 months,"We bought our Sony Bravia less than 3 months ago, and sometimes it won't turn on and the red Lamp light goes on. Apparently we need to get a new lamp (which costs $250)!Sony sucks."
5,Butch and Sundance,Really liked the dvd. Contained certain information that I didnt know before. I find it amazing that 2 notorious outlaws from the west could still be so enchanting this many years later.
2,butch would not be happy with the production,"The historical content is mildly informative and raises some interesting conundrums viz did he die in Bolivia or return to the US. Whilst I enjoyed what the program contained, I really became irritated with the visual presentation. There is an excessive amount of stylistic, so called artistic, slo-mo out of focus scene transitions. Is this the new way to bulk up running time? It really is annoying. Content is repetitive - what this 50 min show presents could be said in 20 minutes.Not one of the History Channels better docos."
3,Return to the Technological Eden,"This book would more accurately be titled ""Christianity and Technology,"" as Noble treats his subject exclusively from a Western perspective. He provides a good overview of religious motivations for scientific and technological progress from medieval times to the American space program and Human Genome Project. Especially inspiring to these researchers and inventors have been apocalyptic expectations and the impulse to recreate the original relationship between God and humans in Eden. However, the book suffers in the last chapters as Noble examines modern research in genetics, artificial intelligence, space flight, and nuclear weaponry, and the author's thesis that religion is inciting dangerous developments in these fields is a weak one."
4,Interesting Slice of History,"This book provides a great, well written, social study of a forgotten slice of american history. Although the book over-emphasizes certian things, and leaves out or under-emphasizes other things, this book was an enjoyable summer read."
2,Misleading title,"This is a collection of excerpts from novels by 11 different authors. Contrary to the title, they are not all about spies. Some are about revolutionaries, at least one about wartime resistance, and one is about two men stranded on a road at night in Vietnam. The point in time is not always clear. The stories are in no particular order by chronology or subject, but are simply in alphabetic order by the authors' last names. The writing quality is mixed and some are skimable. Some seem to have too much background color and not enough story. I think the collection could have been much better considering the literature available. The best value that I obtained was identifying authors to avoid."
2,Promise not delivered,I was disappointed in this book. I expected something more exciting and think the selection was poor.
2,review,Movie was ok yet I expected something different in terms of Peter Cushing's role. The various nuossiances were somewhat disappointing.
3,From beyond the grave,"One of Amazon's new Dvds, From beyond the grave is split into 5 stories most of which are entertaining. This is the only Amicus Dvd that I have bought,and I am quite pleased with it.I would recommend it to others"
3,NOTHING LIKE THE 70'S & 80'S MOVIES,"WHEN IT COMES TO HORROR, THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THE 70'S AND THE 80'S MOVIES. THEY WERE MUCH GORIER AND THEY LOOKED REAL. SOMETIMES THE BLOOD CONTENT WAS A LOT OFF. LOOKED LIKE RED PAINT, BUT THE GRUSOMENESS OF WHAT THEY DID BACK THEN WAS MUCH BETTER THAN TODAYS COMPUTER GENERATED JUNK. IM 24 YEARS OLD. IM A MOVIE BUFF AND IF YOU LIKE HORROR YOU NEED TO CHECK OUT ALL THE HAMMER AND AMICUS FLICKS,AND FOR STARTERS, FROM BEYOND THE GRAVE WOULD BE A GOOD CHOICE. WATCH IN THE DARK WITH FRIENDS..."
4,At Long Last,"I have been waiting for this to come out on DVD for a very long time. I was overjoyed by the picture quality, way better than anything I saw on TV in my childhood however the sound is very low and I found myself watching with the volume up full.Each story has its merits but the one that stayed with me was the second. Donald Pleasance's daughter is amazing as the grim seductress - ""Do you want me to? Are you sure you want me to?"" everyone is perfectly cast and the twist is suitably surreal. The comic story about The Elemental - the light relief usually being a dead duck in these movies - is actually very funny due to a good script and again great performances."
4,Good film,Good film made in the 70's. The stories are good and similar to those of Tales from the crypt and Vault of horror.
4,1970's Hammer,"I must confess that I am not a fan of post 1970 Hammer films, but this was a good one. Peter Cushing is worth watching no matter what film he does. The first time you watch it, you might not be impressed, but the more you view it the better it gets. The director did a good job of making the short films interesting and entertaining, with a little gore added, that does not detract from the films. In my view, Hammer made the best horror films ever, without the ""blood & guts"" most American horror films revel in."
1,Why so many high ratings for this movie?,"While the movie Tales from the Crypt deserves the highest rating, this movie was extremely disappointing and almost comical rather than terrifying. I'll be giving it away to someone that might appreciate it more than myself."
2,Dissappointed ERB Fan,"Normally, I am a big fan of Edgar Rice Burroughs, having read more than 70 of his books. But I was unable to read more than 20 pages at a sitting of ""The War Chief"". I found this poor man's ""Romeo and Juliet"" difficult because of all the hyphenated Apache words. Burroughs' tongue in cheek defense of the ""noble savage"" was an interesting theme throughout, but the main story line was not enough to keep my interest.If you are a devout fan of ERB then buy the book, by all means. But, if you are sampling Burroughs for the first time, you are better off with one of the Tarzan or John Carter stories."
3,Still available,"In September 2005, I also purchased this book from George Athanas, Thalassi Enterprises, LLC,(...). The service was great and he was very responsive. The book was very well packaged upon delivery. The book itself is very good in regards to the photographic images. The narratives are lacking and I was hoping for more info on the various villages of Chios but the book was still interesting."
3,Fun but not geared towards adults,"This is a fun book but, I must admit, that I was a bit disappointed. I was hoping for something geared towards adults (or, at the least, towards an intelligent teen). This book is specificially geared towards children (i.e., a bright 8 year old or above). It is certainly a friendly book filled with colorful (if somewhat unimaginative) drawings. As well, it covers many of the issues relevant to the subject (e.g., why movie aliens shouldn't be regarded as realistic). My only complaint, once you correlate it to its intended audience, is that it does speak authoritatively more often then it should for such a speculative topic (e.g., it claims that we can expect that most intelligent species should have a humanoid template which is, to say the least, a debatable position).Be that as it may, I would certainly recommend it if you want to introduce a child to the topic or if you know of a child that is already interested. For adults, however, I'd give it a miss."
1,not pleased!,"This toy, a sort of colorform, just didn't stick as it should. My granddaughter found it extremely frustrating and I feel I wasted my money on it."
3,L,Great story but Kindle version is full of errors. Very distracting. This could benefit from a better conversion process to get the printed version transferred to the Kindle format.
5,I LOVED IT!,This was my 1st Dorothy Garlock book that I have ever read. I loved the people in the book and the love that Johnny and Kathleen had. When I was reading it made me feel like I was there in the book. Hope mrs. garlock writes books in the future about these people! ITS A MUST READ!
2,WHAT'S SO GREAT ABOUT THESE 4 BOOKS?,"I read all four books: WITH HOPE, WITH SONG, WITH HEART and AFTER THE PARADE and while all had good story lines, they weren't great--Just simple country stories about country families. Loves that break up/then make up; bad guy in town/ bad apple or two in the family/ etc. etc. Nothing that made me want to turn pages, but an easy read while waiting in an office for an appointment.I don't understand all the great reviews. These books could have been combined into one book and you still wouldn't be turning pages!"
1,bad bad bad book,"i am a big fan of the second world war periode so i was very exited about this book.i think it's the first time where i hate a hero so much i wish the writer had killed him!i do not understand what Kate saw in him !!!!! he was stupid and whiney .if you love a good WW2 book try ""the blue bicycle"" from deforgesAVOID !"
4,Adversaries Walk Among Us,"While this author titles his book demons and spirits, he admits that many of these are ""attachments"" which are likely other than demons... and may be just a fragment of someone's soul. If that sentence doesn't entice you, nothing will! It is an interesting book, worth reading by everyone in the psychic/mediumship business. However, although I found some valuable insights, I hope someone is going to write about this without the basis in Christianity. The author admits this is much older than Christianity, even the removal of such. He wants to quibble over the ""right"" way to remove them. I hope someone writes another book that includes other entities as well."
1,Garbage,"The man is a quack. He uses his ""magic pendulum"" to tease the answers out of his subjects. He swings the pendulum purposefully in the manner needed for the answers he wants. This is so he can suck in another victim to pay for his fake treatments. I wish people would learn to think for themselves and not be sucked in by this junk."
2,will not fit 2005 mazda6 wagon,the spacer is too long for the front stock spring/shock. it will interfere with the shock boot. height is ok but it's too long.
4,The better of the two cd's,"With Appetite for Destruction, Guns N Roses put out a cd with out one weak song on it. Unfortunately the same thing can't be said for Use Your Illusion I or Use Your Illusion II. This is the better of the two cd's though because of the inclusion of NOVEMBER RAIN, DON'T CRY, COMA,... There are some classic gnr rockers on this cd- and two power ballads that match the promise of SWEET CHILD O MINE, but this cd was put together too hastily to be perfect...if only they would have just released one cd...with all of the good songs on it...i guess i'm pipe dreaming"
5,Their harmony hits a deep chord,"Before listened to it, I had thought that G'N R was the band of trouble because vocalist Axl is the infamous man that used violent words and have been arrested two times. But,I forgot such a thing after I listen to it. Their harmony hits a deep chord. The high-pitched sounds characterise of Axl Rose. It's one of G'N R'charms. So,I especially recommend ""Don't cry "" They sing ""Don't you cry tonight,I still love you,baby"" You can't help feeling their gentleness."
5,TOO GOOD TO PASS UP!,"No gunner can live without the Illusions! ""November Rain"" is a true masterpiece. Whereas ""Don't Damn Me"" keeps your head banging! DO NOT pass this CD up, trust me!"
4,Mood music,"I bought this album 11 years ago along with UYI 2 and I definitely prefer the other one. Use Your Illusion I is harder and angrier, with dashes of country (You Ain't The First), spanish classical (guitar solo at the end of Double Talkin' Jive), to epic ballads (November Rain). One of the things that makes Guns N'Roses stand apart from other 80's metal bands is the diversity of style, which in my mind makes the Use Your Illusion set superior to Appetite For Destruction, and Axl's virtuostic keyboard skills. I would recommend this album to anyone, if only for November Rain, in my opinion THE BEST ballad ever written."
4,Use Your Illusion 1,"Awesome CD, not as fast and heavy as the first, but still a very well put together CD. it has a mix of everything... Slash kix serious arse. Its one of my favorites but it will get off your mind after more then 10 listens."
5,November Rain,This is the best cd for Live and Let Die & November Rain. Thereason I got this cd is because November Rain had some of the best riffs I have ever heard in my life. That's what's known asbest song ever! Buy UYI2 if you are very interested in this album. Great CD
4,Great Late Album`,"I am a huge guns 'n' roses fan. I have every cd besides the spagetti incident, live era, and use your illusion. I am not a huge fan of their later songs but this record is just as good as the earlier records. This record and Use Your Illusion 2 are the best later Guns 'n' Roses records.Good Songs: Right Next Dorr to H***, November Rain, Live and Let Die, Don't Cry, and Dead Horse."
5,lovely jubbly,This is easily the best of the two albums in the 'Use Your Illusion' range. Although 'coma' goes on for a bit too long the album redeems itself with songs like 'don't damn me' and a wonderful cover of Paul and Linda McCartney's 'live and let die'. Without a doubt this is a must have for any Guns n' Roses fan and any fans of this genre.
4,number 1 G n R album?,"This is definatly the album to get if you are a G n R fan,mixing heavy rock(double talking jive,right next door to hell) with classic songs (don't cry, november rain)until a new album comes along buy this one!"
2,The beginning of the end for G n' R.,"Guns N' Roses rocked their way to popularity by being real. Appetite for Destruction and GNR Lies were great because they were raw and abrasive. Then, wouldn't you know? They became big rock stars and thought that they needed to have pianos, backup singers, and all sorts of over-produced garbage on their albums. The Illusion albums marked the beginning of the end for Axl and the boys. They thought they had to be ""artists"" instead of just kicking ass. Blame Axl."
2,Go Listen To Metallica,both Illusion albums have a few good songs on tehm but are mostly filler. they had about an EP worth of good songs if you combine both albums.
5,Guns N' Roses,"It's hard to imagine that Guns N' Roses could have improved after Appetite for Destruction, but they did. While still having killer, straight-ahead rock n' roll, this album (as well as Use Your Illusion II) brought them into a much greater realm of musical possibility. Although Use Your Illusion I is slightly better then II, both albums show the band was more diverse and exposed their many different styles. This is because, in part, Guns N' Roses (unlike most other bands) were never content to put out another album that was like something they already did. After the success of Appetite for Destruction, most bands would set out to make another one just like it. Instead, Guns N' Roses was more concerned with growing and expanding their horizons. In the end that is the mark of a truly great rock n' roll band. -- 8/13/98"
5,becuz of 1 song,just listen to November Rain...it makes me cry every time. Remember the good old days? this one will remind you!I wish they would ge back together and tour one more tme.
5,Eases you into what's next.,"Even though I personally like all of Guns N Roses CDs and could never pick a favorite, this is a really good CD. Many people feel the song selection for UYI1 is very random. To me, it still keeps to the style of music used on Appetite for Dustruction, but at the same time gives you songs like November Rain to start easing you into the more mellow Use Your Illusion II. Depending on which side of GnR you like (the hard or the mellow) just depends on which UYI album you will enjoy. However, you really can't do one without the other."
5,still classic,"I remember when the use your illusion albums came out and how great they were at the time. More then a decade later, the albums are still great. Use your illusion I has little more of an aggressive sound to it with songs like right next door to hell, garden of eden and dust N' bones. Listening to this album gives you the real sense that this is what Guns N' Roses is really all about."
4,Use Your Illusion I,"I own both ""Use Your Illusion I and II"" and UYI 1 is definately the better of the two. Illusion I shows just how hard GnR can rock, while Illusion II focuses more on suicide and the darker side of life. If youre a GnR fan this is a must own. If you like this then youll definately love their debut release ""Appetite for Destruction."""
2,Filler Alert!,"Never have two albums (illusion 1 and 2) ever had this much filler. You could combine these two disks into 12 songs and have a pretty decent follow up to Appetite albeit half the songs would be remakes. The rest of the songs some of which they had the gall to release and make videos for (remember when MTV showed videos) should have been eliminated. Didn't they ever hear of editing? Of course it's been 8 years and they haven't done anything since, so I suppose they had to go for quantity when they could. Coma, Nov. Rain, Dont Cry, You could be mine, and Pretty Tied up are great songs - too bad there is so much filler surrounding them."
5,GNR are metal Gods!!!,"I have been listening to GNR since I was in kindergarten and 13 years later they are my favorite band.Use your Illusion I is probably the best album they put out since Appetite.the cover of Live and Let Die is one of the best covers I've heard in my life.Don't Cry,November Rain,Garden of Eden,and Dead Horse totally rock.Slash is a true guitar GOD!His amazing guitar solos could be an album within themselves.I recommend this album to anyone who truly appreciates metal.And keep hope alive, GnR will eventually put out another album with it's original members.GnR rocks!!!!"
4,Both would have been better as one,"Both Use Your Illusion CD's contain some great songs and a lot of filler. If they would have taken the best songs from both they would have had an album that rivaled their first. The filler could have been used as ""B-sides"" for all the hits."
3,Use your discretion,"Strangely in many ways these dated quicker than what made GnR in the 80's. While epic balladry clearly is the strong point, it falls few and far between raucous rockers that seldom highlight what eroded Slash-n-Axl synergy was left."
3,Use Your Illusion 1,This is a great record. It's got some of Slash's greatest riffs and Axl Roses' amazing vocals. it starts off with a great bass riff in 'Right Next Door To Hell' and than goes into 'Dust N' Bones' which is one of the best Guns N' Roses Songs ever. Though some of the songs are kind of weird (Need i mention 'Bad Obsession') this is still an amazing record.
4,epic sleaze,"[some] say that both of these releases could have been cut up to make one absolute monster of a cd, but the truth is that when a band gets to this stature they all of a sudden have a lot 2 say. some of it may be garbage some may be gold, but some people like trash and hate gold. that being said, it's interesting 2 hear all that axl has 2 say, whether it's sexist, crude, or downright honest. 'don't damn me' has the most honest set of lyrics i've ever heard and i wish i knew people who lived by these words. 'november rain' does run 2 long but he's being sensitive here. the music is updated 'exile on main st.' w/a bit of punk edge. overall a very worthy release to anyone's collection, fans of axl or no."
5,Best GNR album ever.,"With the release of this double-set record, GNR produced one of the best music of all time. These albums are brilliant both musically and lyrically. Too bad that the band broke up. Oh, well ""Nothing lasts forever, even cold November rain."""
4,How to redress the filler issue,"To redress what people have been saying, here is my cut at how I would redo the UYU albums to make a more coherent two albumsUSE YOUR ILLUSION I (THE BALADS AND EPICS)November RainLive and Let DieKnockin on Heavens DoorDon't CryYesterdayCivil WarEstrangedComaThe GardenBreakdownUSE YOUR ILLUSION II (Blues rock, and Alt singers)Right Next Door to HellLocomotiveDust and BonesYou Aint the FirstDouble Talkin JiveYou Could be Mine14 YearsSo FinePretty Tied UpBad ObsessionDISCARD AS REALLY BADMy WorldBad ApplesGarden of EdenShotgun BluesBack off BitchDon't Damn MePerfect CrimeDon't Cry (Alt Lyrics)Get in the Ring"
2,"matt sorum sucks... but worth it for ""coma""...","duh... like they erased steven adler's drum tracks because HE was a heroin addict..? replaced it with matt sorum's plodding drumming which kills any momentum these songs could've had... further, it's obvious that axl's singing was done to the beat of steven adler's drumming... without it and with the samsonite gorilla drumming of sorum his vocals don't make any sense from a musical standpoint... drug-addict or not, steven adler was a damn good drummer that propelled appetite and the rest of the band... having said all that, ""coma"" is worth the price of admission because it's the culmination of where the band was heading as axl took more and more control(this is really his solo album...)... ""coma"" isn't what it could have been with the adler of appetite, but then again neither was this album and neither was guns n' roses by 1990..."
5,still great after 20 years,"I could have done without the 'Live and Let Die' cover song but there is a lot of music on this CD. It has the crossover mainstream songs, the hard bangers and the in-betweeners.Doesn't leave you wanting more, full-filling in vocals, guitars, drums and overall band chemistry."
4,A classic from GNR,"Use your illusion is a two disc super album from GNR one of the greatest hard rock albums.The 1st album is a great album which contains such great songs as Dust N Bones,Dont Cry and the best song on this album November Rain.Both of these albums the 1st and 2nd are terrific and are very highly recommended."
4,"Sharp, biting, if a little uneven.","This was Guns N' Roses' best configuration -- Izzy Stradlin' and Slash providing the buzzsaw guitars and melodic solos, Matt Sorum providing the big, strong beats, and Axl Rose writing some of his best songs (mixed in with a few duds).Use Your Illusion I contains the sprawling ""November Rain"", Guns N' Roses' most successful attempt at enriching its basic rock-band arrangements with keyboard strings, piano, and multiple vocals. ""Don't Cry"" is a little watery as a ballad, but ""Right Next Door to Hell"" finds the band deliciously cantankerous, R ose ranting vitriolic but intriguing lyrics,""Dust and Bones"" is funky metal in the Aerosmith tradition, and ""Dead Horse"" is the kind of raucous bulldozer Guns N' Roses excells at.Its companion album is the superior record, but Use Your Illusion I remains one of the last and finest of statements by an '80s metal band."
1,Too much for me,"As you listen to certain music, you realize what kind of person you are. Guns N Roses are just a bit too intense for me. Poison, Twisted Sister and a few others are more suited to my personality than G 'N' R."
2,A disappointment,"""Don't Cry"" and ""November Rain"" are the masterpieces, but the rest is junk. This and part II are the first and the last GNR albums I will ever buy."
4,THANKS FOR HANGIN' IN THERE SLASH,"THIS IS A GREAT LIST OF TRACKS. MORE AGGRESSIVE THAN ILLUSION 2. THE ADDITION OF MATT (DRUMMER)OPENED THE BAND UP TO A MORE TECHNICAL AVENUE. SLASH CAN OBVIOUSLY KEEP UP WITH IT ALL. TO ME THIS WAS THE LAST POSITIVE PRODUCT THAT AXL ROSE WAS A PART OF. TOO BAD AXL HAS HAD PROBLEMS THAT KEEP THE BAND DOWN. USE YOUR ILLUSION I IS PACKED FULL OF TUNES RANGING IN TEMPO AND AGRESSIVENESS. GREAT WORK OF ART.MARK ""TATTOO"" STEELE"
5,The guns n roses show,"This was the 5th guns album i bought my first being : Greatest Hits, 2nd Appetite: third Use your illusion 2 and then lies and finally Uyi 1.Each time i bought a new guns album i heard a new sound completly different to the album before it. My fav. songs on this album are Don't damn me, Dead horse, Back off Bitch and definetly COMA. The riffs are unbelivable, Matt on the drums is great and axl well he is legendary, his voice, ever changing and his lyrics especially on Coma are mind blowing. Buy this album. You have to appriciate the lyrics of Axl and the others to really get this album. But there are still some hard rockin classics 5*"
3,is this rock !?,"i think that slash must listen to some kiss work before he picks up a guitar again , this band is not for rock lovers all of ya should search for psycho circus , thats the good stuff (kiss rocks)"
1,spit junk,"This is another bad album. It has more spit songs than part 2.The only good song is NOVEMBER RAIN. LIVE AND LET DIE ROCKS ALSO.This album has more sex drugs violence liquor ugly talking andcigarrete smoke than part 2. BOTH ALBUMS SUCK. GNR SUCKS!!!!DIRE STRAITS AND FOREIGNER ARE BETTER.WANT GNR? JUST OWN GREATEST HITS FROM THEMBECAUSE AXL, SLASH, DUFF, AND MATT SORUM ARE IDIOTS."
1,#2,"Since Amazon was reluctant to post my original, harsh review, I decided to listen to this album again and give it another chance, and man does it suck! I was especially revolted the awful cover of that wretched Wings tune, `Live And Let Die', a song so lame that I even disliked it back in the days when I thought the Beatles were geniuses."
1,WISH I COULD GO BELOW ONE STAR,"ZERO STARS ARE MORE APPROPRIATE AS G'N'R ARE REALLY AN AWFUL BAND.NOVEMBER RAIN AND DUST'N'BONES SUCK!!!!!.DONT MAKE THE MISTAKE OF BUYING THIS AWFUL ALBUM.CONSERVE YOUR MONEY AND GET STICKY FINGERS FROM THE ROLLING STONES INSTEAD.PS:G'N'R ARE TERRIBLE,G'N'R ARE TERRIBLE."
3,overindulgence,"Following the success of Appetite and Lies, the boys decided to wack on any and every song (except surprisingly the b-side 'shadow of your love' that they had ever written and anthologise it onto this 2 CD monster.The result is an uneven ride through very average and dull songs interspersed by several masterpieces.Basically, the first side of this album (ie songs 1-9) should have been scrapped (but for 'Bad Obsession' and 'Don't Cry')and filled in with the best of CD 2, to make a kicker of an album.Instead we have the mish-mash that this is. Still, the standout tracks are Bad Obsession, Don't Cry, November Rain (written originally for the Appetite album believe it or not) and Coma.The rest of the left over songs would have made great b-sides instead, because that is what they are."
2,Combine the two.,"In a perfect world, GnR would have combined the two Illusions albums into one excellent album. That would have been a worthy followup to their other recordings. As is, two albums were too much. Oh well, I'll keep listening to Appetite."
2,NOT VERY DURABLE,"We use a ozone generator for our aquarium.After a few months (4-5), this unit stopped working.I suppose it did as designed, but just not what we needed (daily).Might have other useful applications..."
4,Corvairs in black and white,I like this book but there are no color pictures in it .... just thought you should know...
4,Short but good !,"Of course, 12 tracks and 49 minutes is a bit short in the cd era and for a Lou Reed compilation. But this compilation works anyway. The remastered sound is fist rate as it is the same than on the NYC Man compilation. The choice of tracks and the sequencing are cleaver. It's good to have Wild Child, Temporary Things, Shooting Star and The Gun on the cd. These tracks are realy good and aren't obvious choices like Walk On The Wild Side, Satellite of love and Coney Island Baby wich are on all Lou Reed compilations (and hopefuly also on this one). So, if you aren't looking for a complete compilation (impossible with Lou Reed), you may try this one."
1,I didn't get this item but I haven't had my money back yet.,"Because of your late delivery, I didn't get this item. I got your confirmed email for that but I haven't had my money back yet. What happen? I'm not in the USA. Please return my money back soon!!!"
5,Great book!!! Can't wait for sequel!!,Susan Krinard has done it again!! Look out fans this is another great one! This is the story of Cassidy Holt who was orphaned at a young age and raised by human relatives despite her werewolf blood. When old enough Cassidy goes in search of her werewolf relatives with only a name her mother had left her....What she finds is conflicting emotions towards her family and the head of that family....Does she truly belong???
3,Not so Great,"I can't give a rounded synopsis of this book because I only made it half way through. The book itself has a good premise, but the characters lack dimension and depth.Cassidy has hidden strengths and a certain amount of vulnerability that at first endeared her to me. However, by the middle of the book, she hadn't grown up or expanded her personality.I'm a huge fan of the Laurel K Hamiltons/Katy McAllistars of the world and between books I go exploring for new Authors. I'm sorry to say Susan Krinard doesn't make my list as a must read."
4,"Wife Of Moon, by Margaret Coel",Another good book. You really cannot go wrong when you pick up one of her books. She always satisfies.
2,Bland In Comparison to Other Vonnegut,"When one has read many of the great and wonderful works of Mr. Vonnegut, this book leaves one cold. It compares well to reading the cover story in a tabloid."
2,Total thievery,"After reading a vast assortment of Vonnegut's work I found this book unsatisfying in the extreme. Usually honest, often brutally so, Vonnegut works this book into a crecendo of cheesiness. What had potential to be a genuine classic like ""Breakfast of Champions"", ""Dead Eye Dick"" and ""Slaughter House Five"", became nothing more than a cheap commentary on the human race with a sappy 'love thy neighbour' quality. If I want to be scammed by an unimaginative ending I will go to Hollywood; movies are less time consuming."
2,Brilliant portrayal of life as ivory-tower dwellers know it.,"To paraphraze Winston Churchill, if you don't weep over Vonnegut's acclaimed social satire at 20, you have no heart. If you still weep while re-reading it at 35, you have no brain. By masterfully portraying the abyss between the ""dirt-poor"" and ""filthy rich"", wittily arguing that the latter are far more useless than the former, Vonnegut only casually mentions the fairly well-washed millions in between; the ground on which the demarcation lines are blurred, and his personal rules of humanism are frequently set aside in favor of garden-variety street smarts. Vonnegut's trademark quirky characters, vivid style, and tight, beautifully wrapped up plot are, as always, very useful weapons in his emotional blackmail: if you don't see the world on his terms, if you take neither side, be ashamed of yourself! Be very ashamed of yourself..."
2,disappointing,"As a huge vonnegut fan, I was very upset to find that this book had a badly developed plot, uninteresting characters, and an almost tragic lack of all the things that make a vonnegut novel great. There really wasn't even what I'd call a complete story, and I skipped a lot of pages out of boredom just to keep things moving. Not recommended for anyone except the rare person who thinks Vonnegut's good books are bad and wants to read a bad one for the sheer pleasure of it all."
2,"eccentric, naive, and often rather dull","After greatly enjoying some Vonnegut sci-fi, I was perhaps looking for the wrong thing with this book. It is a weird story about a nutty millionaire, who is in danger of losing his money to an assembly of the sleaziest twits you could possibly imagine. While there are many very funny asides, such as his love of Kilgore Troustian conceptions or the characterizations of the evil guys (one's posterior is ""luminous when wet""), the plot is weak and far-fetched. For example, Rosewater's grandfather built his massive fortune by buying companies in accordance with their acronyms from the Bible's text! That is too silly to be satire. Moreover, Vonnegut's laments about the coldness and brutality of American capitalism are sentimental and even ignorant. He seems to have an obsession with rich people and money.Not recommended."
3,Sad,"Sad to say I found this a little monotonous. I always like Vonnegut's work but this didn't work for me. I'll have to try another, this seemed dated in light of financial shenanigans of this century."
3,"Not one of Vonnegut's best, but a good book.","GOD BLESS YOU MR.ROSEWATER was a fun book to read but it went nowhere! Until I got to the last page, I was waiting for something exciting to happen but that excitement never came.The story is of Eliot Rosewater who is the president of the enormously rich Rosewater Foundation. Eliot gives money to anyone who asks and gives everyone his kindness and love. But Norman Mushari, a nasty lawyer, is out to prove that Eliot is insane and the family foundation should be given to a distant cousin.This book was published in 1965 and was one of Vonnegut's first 5 books. This is a good book but definitely not one of the esteemed writer's best. This book is a fun quick read and I would recommend reading it. But for anyone under the age of 15, it would bore the hell out of them."
3,Could have been better...,"The bad thing about having a writer that your really respect and admire is that at some point they will let you down. Rosewater is a little ditty, a nice try. The book has a lot of potential to be more than it is, but it is caught up in the very same trivial matters that it is satirizing. The loose plot is heavily focused on money as a good and equally evil thing, and it drifts from one character to the next without the amazing wit of Vonnegut's other novels. Read Cat's Cradle instead, that's a masterpiece."
5,"i can trully say, ""God bless you, Mr. Rosewater.""","in church, on the subway, mr. rosewater makes me cry. beautiful, the way we should all look at life. the drunk, caring for the people of his town in indiana, a 'great guy'. mr rosewater. with the largest fire alarm in the western hemisphere. seven miles away, at high noon, the dog's squeel-ruff ruff, visitors in the cafe, spill.thank you, god bless you, mr. rosewater."
3,"""Goddamnit you've got to be kind!""","Demonstrates a good knowledge of American history--impressive really.Humor: excellent. very funny.Eliot Rosewater: kind of a pathetic ideal. makes you suspicious of KV-whether this is what he actually thought of life, that it would be alright if only one had no less than 10L's of Kentucky Whiskey on hand, and a massive fortune to philanthrophize with.Still one of my all time favorites."
3,Social commentary & character study disguised as a novel,"A conniving lawyer wants a chunk of a foundation's money, and schemes to prove the current head of the foundation is insane so he can orchestrate a coup d'etat and get a commission when his hand-picked successor takes over. However, the line between ""insane"" and ""saintly"" is very blurry...As with most Vonnegut, the ""plot"" is the weakest element, and one reads the work for the dark humor and social insights. This is especially the case here, where things fall apart at the last chapter in (to me) a most unsatisfactory and unsatisfying way. Given the number of 5-star reviews, others are much more forgiving about this.Not KV's best, but not his worst, either. Maybe worth reading once, especially if you like the author."
4,Eliot Rosewater shows us all a little something,"Slaughterhouse Five often gets the credit, but this is the best Vonnegut book out there. There is a lot we can all learn from Kilgore Trout, and if a drunken Eliot Rosewater can figure it out - its sad that others out in this world can't."
3,"A Hip Sixties Re-Telling of ""Harvey.""","Like Elwood P. Dowd (the hero of Mary Chase's play ""Harvey"") Vonnegut's Eliot Rosewater is a wealthy drunk with heart of gold who drives his loved ones batty and nearly ends up permanently committed to the booby-hatch because of his uncommon generosity and love for the ordinary people of his small home town. Instead of a large invisible rabbit, Eliot chooses as his soulmate science-fiction writer Kilgore Trout, who becomes a sort of imaginary best-friend to Eliot, and, like Harvey, only asserts his actual presence at the end of the story. The book is better than the play (or the James Stewart movie, for that matter), but it is not one of Vonnegut's best. In ""Palm Sunday"" Vonnegut gives this book an ""A."" I'd rate it a ""C."" It's nowhere near as good as ""Mother Night,"" for instance."
2,Bleh!,Didn't care for this work very much. It went on and on and on in it's side comentaries and I got bored with it. Still not sure just what he was writing about here. Stopped reading before I was half way through. Bleh!
1,Not so good.,"I have never read anything by this author, and thought this sounded like an opportunity to try. Glad I didn't spend any more money on it-pretty ridiculous, verbose reading. Hard to wade through-made it to the third chapter before giving up."
4,"Not quite among his best, but still enjoyable for Vonnegut fans ~","Though this is not quite his best or most complex work, I enjoyed this novel for many reasons. First, it does lean heavily towards a Socialistic viewpoint. Which is not necessarily a bad thing. The novel is a thinly veiled critique towards capitalism and a sadly poignant look at the future of the impoverished. One man makes it his life's goal to help out the unfortunates using his money and position. He is then considered mentally unsound by those who are in positions of power and authority.The book is well written in typical satirical Vonnegut style. The novel is not as compelling or deep as Slaughterhouse Five or Cat's Cradle, but it is an enjoyable, top notch work by itself. If one didn't have an entire body of Vonnegut works to compare this to, it would stand out as a very good novel by itself (hence my four star rating). Just compared to other Vonnegut novels it is slightly lacking."
4,"Great, but not for a first Vonnegut read","I just finished this book, and I absolutely loved it. This was the last Vonnegut novel I hadn't read, and it was definitely a great summary of themes and beliefs he expresses in his other novels.To that end, I wouldn't recommend it as a first Vonnegut read. It's almost an essay about his views on the madness of capitalism in America.It's a great novel, no doubt, with a very satisfying ending. But if you've heard about Kurt Vonnegut and you just want to try it out, try ""Slaughterhouse Five,"" ""Hocus Pocus,"" ""Cat's Cradle,"" or ""Mother Night.""You really can't go wrong with this amazing author, but ""God Bless You Mr. Rosewater"" might come off as a bit preachy if you don't know what you're getting into.That being said, it is still a great novel. So if you're a fan, read this book."
5,Don't miss!,"Appropriate even today. The fault of they versus us, the rich control everything. Asks if some wealth should be taken from the rich and given to the poor. How did it work out with Russia?Great book! I went crazy with highlights for the first part of the book.Really made me think. Loved the book and it had a great ending. Well worth reading."
3,Not one of Vonnegut's more interesting reads,"This book has all the makings of a classic Vonnegut text. However, it lacks depth, and the plot never really thickens. By the end of the novel, I was asking myself, ""Wait, how did we get to this point in the story?"" The overall idealism which is used to give character development to Rosewater takes away from the reality of the situation. The novel does have rewarding characteristics, but I do not think this should be the first book by Vonnegut that one reads."
4,A Heartening Story,"A very heartening story about the life of somewhat regular people. That is, not extravagent. Although very eccentric, but that's what one expects from KV. The story is pretty strong, and very funny along the way. Not a good first-time read from Vonnegut."
4,To call this a DEEP read is an understatement.,"Mr. Vonnegut has put forth a great piece of literature that binds together the worlds of poverty and gross wealth in a study on what makes human beings worthwhile or worthless and the make up of the architect of man.This novel is a collage of introspection and lessons. Using religious allegory, Vonnegut shows that human beings are only human-- whether poor or rich. His god figurine, when all sculpted by the end of the book, shows the reader a view on the creator of man: entropic on the surface, yet acutely set in his ways of good, even after the denouncment of him by his people. Take this view however you wish.Vonnegut's god is all of us: rich, poor, filthy, crazy... the list goes on. And Vonnegut raises the strange question: Was God crazy for producing mankind?This novel is thought provoking, entertaining, and enlightening. Take my view however you wish."
3,Not what I thought it was,"Although the product says it is corduroy, the image makes it look smoother than it actually is, I thought I was getting something a little more formal than casual. I ended up returning the product."
2,catchy but only for a while,I can get with the Crunk vibe for a Minute but after about 15-20 minutes I get tired of the sound&vibe because not much changes.this cut is cool though on the club vibe&also as a Party Opener but Beyond that it feels more worn out after a while.
1,13 bucks for a single!,These greedy guys think they can get away with charging that much for one decent club song! No wonder its not available on itunes (where they would only be able to charge 99c). I like the song but I am not playing into their hands! Boycott this song till they bring the price down to earth....
2,Get low went to #2 gets 2 stars no coincedence,Get Low this song is the Low point of Lil Jons carrierLyrics 1/10 Production 7/10 Overall 4/10
4,Perfect for what I need,I bought this portable speaker as an accessory to my iPod Touch 1st gen (2nd gen has a built-in speaker). Truth be told the reason I bought this is so my kids can listen to music or watch a video on my iPod 1)without having to use the ear buds 2)without fighting over who gets to hear the sound. It works perfectly for that. I find the sound to be acceptable. My one and only complaint is that I have to manually turn off the speaker unit or it will run the battery down. I often forget to turn the switch off. More of a user problem than anything.
3,"You can make these work, but...","I bought these because I wanted portable music for my vacation this summer. I didn't want anything too expensive. I was a little hesitant when I read other reviews about the low volume of these speakers, but I bought it anyway.Yup, the other reviewers were right: this thing has almost NO power to increase your iPod's volume. I could only make it work well by putting it into a (dry) bidet in a really echoic bathroom. Where I was staying had really hard surfaces and so the rooms were very alive. The extra amplification of the bidet worked perfectly! The only problem is, of course (you guessed it), I had to either stay IN the bathroom or to be Vewy-Vewy Quiet in the rest of the house.Would I buy them again? Nope.Save your money unless you want small, personal speakers that you can cuddle up to. Or have your own bidet speaker amplifier!"
4,Dang Battery Switch...,"There's a lot of opportunities I've taken to use this, from proposing to my fiancee (arranging your favorite song for the middle of nowhere is kinda difficult) to playing inspirational music prior to flying a mission. The price and size are excellent, and the volume output is worthy. My only qualm is that the battery does tend to drain when not using it - though this might be to the uncanny nature of the power switch moving to ""on"" in my flight bag. Absolutely worth it though."
1,Horrible product.,"The reviews above are deceiving. I bought this to use with my 80g video ipod while sitting outside in my backyard. I don't need a lot of volume but the volume on this speaker is nil. Not worth it, the only good thing is the size, but it is unusable. It was a waste of money. I have a mini am/fm radio that sounds better than this. I've seen great reviews on this item and reviews that totally hate it, I decided to gamble and order it anyway, thinking, how bad can it be? It is worse than bad. If I could give it negative stars, I would"
1,Not worth the money at all,"It's indeed very portable and super light in weight even when including the 1 AA batrery. But I totally agree with one of the above reviewers regarding the volume. ""The sound is small like mosquito"" as what we would say in the Chinese language. And the quality of the sound is very poor, too. With same amount of the money, you can buy other potable speakers with much better quality. I am browsing now to get a better one."
3,Cool Looking,"This speaker is cool looking so I got one. The sound doesn't go loud and at full blast, it sounds like [...]. If you use it, go to a quiet place."
4,Stray Lady,"Back cover reads:Out of wrecked dreams grew hopeOne minute Georginia had been sailing single-handed down Canada's west coast, willing the salt breezes to show her how to go on living without her husband. The next she was being pulled from the waves by lighthouse keeper Lyle Stevens and drawn into a tranquil existence with him and his little daughter.No one could take the place of Scott. Yet there was something compelling about the way Lyle watched over her as she recovered from her ordeal. His disturbing eyes seemed to caress her soul...And then she realized--he could read her thoughts!"
5,Great Storage Box,I received the Adorama Digital Media Case today. For the price paid this is one of the most surdy Cases I could find It looks great and seals very well against dust and dirt.Just what I needed for my trips coming up this summer to the Dakota's. They will get a realy work out then.
4,Good case,"Well worth the money. I have a habit of loosing card so I picked this up. It has come along on multiple shoots and is still holding up good. It isn't hard to open, but it wont unlatch by accident. Good buy."
4,It is what they said it was!,"Good quality, seems like a strong, long lasting build. I haven't really put it to much use yet. I will add more once I have more to add."
3,Juuuust a little cheap...but they do protect their cargo.,"Fell apart the day I got it. The aluminum panels are fastened to the internal; plastic frame with double sided tape. Cheap cheap cheap. One panel fell off, and would not reattach. I peeled the tape the rest of the way off and put a few globs of epoxy in there, squeezed it, and I think it's good.On the upside, these seem to REALLY offer a lot of protection. I have one that I use a lot for CF cards, and while they look terrible pretty fast (painted, not anodized, and they scratch easily) they seem extremely well designed around their primary purpose, which is protecting media.That cheap finish, by the way, adds a scruffy patina that makes them look war-weary...nobody likes to be the only n00b-looking guy with brand-new tools, right?"
4,Very Good Product,The case feels sturdy and is good looking. The latch is a little finicky but works. The spine of the case is made of plastic. A metal spine/hinge would be better. The case at this price point is excellent and kept in your pocket or camera bag is more than sufficient to protect the memory cards that I use.
5,great product,It shipped fast and now I have a place to store my loose sd cards in my camera bag and they are easy to access.
5,Seems super durable and holds cards very snugly,"I just bought this and my first impression is ""dang I can run this thing over with a truck and it looks like it'll survive"".The outer case it self seems very durable and the rubber inside that holds the cards is perfectly snug to hold my valuable SD cards. Someone mentioned that the hinge looks a bit weak and I can kind of see what they mean, but I'm sure as long as you don't try to snap it in half it'll be fine.If there's any changes/it breaks/something happens I'll be sure to update my review.But so far I'm impressed. It holds the SD cards really well, seems super durable, and all at a very inexpensive price. Kudo's Power2000 for making a great product.5/5 stars."
3,American Gardener,"""The American Gardener"" seeks to capture the history of gardening. This is a new edition of the original book that was first printed in 1856. It contains many observations that come from a time when gardeners may have been more in tune with their enivronment. This book details how to lay out gardens, how to manage hot beds and green houses and how to propagate and cultivate many varieties of plants.Cobbett includes annotated lists of plants - vegetables, herbs, fruits, and flowers of the Northeastern United States in the 19th century. He includes descriptions of how plants can be used and prepared for eating. The books weakness is its lack of illustrations, and contemporary nomenclature. Still, Cobbett's sage advice rings true.As a long-time gardener, I find this series interesting - a sort of passport back in time where I can observe how gardening was done before there were so many chemicals."
3,Alexia queen of Euro dance no more,"This is a good album, but I don't really like it.I like her Euro dance better.bye, Natalia"
4,Ballads..dance... It has it all,"This album is not like her prior album ""Fun Club"".This album has a little bit of everything. As always, she sings one of her songs in Spanish,and also mixes two of her hits ""Ohh lalala"" and ""Number One"". This is a good album, and she has a GREAT voice. You'll dance all around."
2,why do you need this,The battery lasts 35 hrs so you may not need a charger. I bought this one as I read reports of so many problems with other ones that I decided to stick with the brand one. It doens't appear any different & is a lot of money for just a charger.
4,Very good read,"Love the style and writing of Burroughs. A return to the books I read as a child and young adult in the backwood communities and tourist meccas of Northern Canada. Brings back many fond memories and seems to let the imagination flow freely and to another world, or place and time. A wonderful book."
3,Interesting Fantasy Story,"First off, if you're expecting another ""Princess of Mars"" (or ""Gods of Mars"") you'll probably be disappointed. This story is a fun read, though not nearly as well written as the original Martian Trilogy, and it isn't as much fun (in my opinion).The story is about John Carter's daughter. She is lost during a Martian storm--stranded among a race of living heads (without bodies). She attempts escape and eventually meets up with a young warrior who, of course, has fallen in love with her. They both end up captives of a race of red Martians who play Chess with living people (the people play to the death).The story is rather imaginative, though not as good as the original. I'd say that this is the last fun book in the series, as the rest are pretty much the same story retold with new names and places."
4,Intriguing Story,"I very much enjoyed the original John Carter of Mars trilogy, though it is not my usual fair. The Chessmen of Mars is also a great read, fast and exciting. The women get to shine a little more independently here, which I like. The creatures we meet in this book are actually a touch disturbing, but so creative. If you enjoy Burroughs you will enjoy this book."
4,The chessmen of mars,"John Carter, who's character we have come to enjoy, only makes a couple of appearances in this book. That doesn't mean that it isn't anything but good. I enjoyed it as much as the last, and i hope that you would too."
4,The Chessmen of Mars,"The Chessmen of Mars is a good old fashioned fantasy novel by Edgar Rice Burroughs. If read in the sequences recommended beginning with ""The Princess of Mars "" it of course makes a lot more sense and gives a much better background for Tara of Helium the daughter of John Carter and Dejah Toras the Princess of Helium. Its a good yarn and has some different twists to it ."
3,Thoughts on The Chessmen of Mars,"The Chessmen of Mars is fun, but I was expecting a lot more of Ghek and more games of (the titled chess-game) Jetan. It did however make me want to play it."
3,big book,i was dissapointed. wanted a paperback book that would fit in jacket pocket.this was apaperback but it was as big as a magazine. could not take to work and fit in back pocket.
5,I Love the John Carter Books,"For any serious literary SciFi fan this is an important series to read, it is classic and charming and every book is extreamly well written. I have a particular soft spot for Edgar Rice Burroughs rythm and his phrasing.This Kindle edition has no issues I found everything worked well and looked nice."
1,Don't order this publisher's edition,"This review is not about Burroughs' book, per se, but about this particular ""book"" from the publisher, Filiquarian Publishing LLC. If you buy it, be forewarned that the publisher did NOT typeset the book, but rather copied a typewritten manuscript in a fixed-width font (it looks like Courier) and bound it. The readability of the text is terrible, and I returned the ""book"" to Amazon for a refund."
2,For the independent traveler?,"I just spent a month in Athens. I had picked this book as my primary guide, based on the advertised bent toward the ""independent traveler"" and an unfortunately cursory look. After a week in Athens, I bit the bullet and went into a local bookstore to pick up The Lonely Planet for Greece. Sigh.A few comments:1) The maps are not good. The map for Athens is terrible.2) If you want information on bars and nightlife, I guess this is your book. If you want information on what you REALLY need to do to catch a KTEL bus from Athens to Delphi, good luck. You'll need it. (Actually, good luck on getting that bus, too, but that's a different story.)3) Way too much cutesy filler and tourist-group bashing.In summary, if by ""independent traveler,"" you mean ""twenty something and drinking my way through Europe on mummy and daddy's money"" then Let's Go Greece is for you!"
4,The Journey Back,"In the 4th grade, i read the prequel to this book, THE UPSTAIRS ROOM. Now, 4 years later, i read THE JOURNEY BACK. The first couple chapters quickly refreshed my memory of what happened during WWII to Annie, and i feel they would have sufficed as an introduction had i not read THE UPSTAIRS ROOM. this book proves that although a treaty was signed, the war was no yet over for the people involved."
2,Not what expected,"I expected a bit better quality than these earrings are. Although attractive, they are very yellow in color and the quality is lacking."
4,Perfect for Little Girl,I purchased these for my 2 granddaughters (ages 4 and 7) who wanted big earrings. I didn't want to invest in gold (for fear of loss) nor did I want to purchase hoops (for fear of injury). They both loved them! the price was just right; if they lose them it doesn't break my budget and they feel like big girls.
5,Scathingly funny -- look past the custesy art.,"I found this book and a Pooch Cafe book at a bookstore in NY recently. Why aren't these strips in the newspaper? I'm tired of all the bland, non-funny strips - it's time for a new generation of comic strips that actually make you laugh instead of saying, ""I could have wrote that.""This book is sad and funny and ultimately a great read."
3,Bad english subtitles - not the TV ones,"My mom's visiting me here in the US and she got hooked on to this series while watching TV. We are from India and the only way she can tell what's going on is from the English subtitles.I decided to get her this box set for her birthday and she's thrilled with it.The only problem is that some of the DVDs have competely meaningless subtitles. No, I dont mean bad grammar (which incidentally is true of all the subtitles in this set - the subtitles arent as good as the ones that come on TV). Some DVDs have a random gathering of english words for subtitles. One of them even has, get this, f*** thrown in. Obviously somebody has played a prank... they probably figured that the viewership was limited to east asia (the set also has chinese and japanese subtitles)... but I guess they were wrong.I am trying to see if I can get the bad subtitled DVDs exhanged from the vendor at all. If I cant, I'd have to make this review 1 star."
2,"Incoherent subtitles and offensive ""F"" word","I had the same problems as the previous review. The subtitles from chapter 33 on seem to be done by a different translater. Name references were totally different from the first 32 chapters. The ""F"" word reference also started from chapter 33. I bought these DVD's because the TV series sold me on the character and moral samples which I thought I could show my grandchildren. I was greatly disappointed. I am currently pursuing a full refund."
3,English translation is lacking,"We had borrowed a different version of this wonderful series. We wanted to purchase one for ourselves, but it was too expensive. This version was a fraction of the price, but the English translation wasn't the same (or as good), so we returned it."
2,Lack of info,"Very nice appearing stacked dado set in a nice box...but, no where in the product info does it mention that the arbor hole size is 1 inch. All the product info for the 6- and 8-inch dado sets mention that they are for 5/8 inch arbors, but strangely nothing about the arbor size when describing the 10-inch dado set."
2,i dont like it,"i heard a 30 second song by samiam (on short music for short people), and i really really liked it, so i went out and bought this cd. i didn't like it at all.. i disliked it so much that i sold it to a record store the day i got it for 5 bucks. i expected it to sound punky, but it didnt at all.. i really don't suggest you buy it if you're a fan of hardcore punk.. maybe their other albums are better."
4,MIxed quickbooks review,"Robust product with lots of name recognition suggested by my accountant. Unfortunately for a non accountant with a new business, it's also difficult to navigate. I have had friends tell me (after the fact) that there are less complicated programs to use.My biggest criticisms though are long waits for customer service - over an hour on several occasions to get an additional feature activated, and since my time equates into money I'm not doing so well here - ouch!Speaking of money, another issue is the the ever present ""nickle and diming"" that occurs whenever you want to use another feature - it's always ala carte! Get your credit cards ready - they understand the American capitalistic system well!Would I buy it again? Probably not - I'd find something a little less robust and more customer friendly - something not recommended by my accountant since I'm the one using it!"
3,"Helped some, but do not use alone","Yeah...Don't use these alone, read your textbook if not a review book. Do plenty of DBQ's. These do help.But i stress (again) do not use them alone.I got a 4. I got lucky too."
2,Kindle version is lame,It is not very well designed for the kindle. The summaries are brief but maybe that's all that most people want from a test prep.
5,Helpful,"Good product, it covers a wide range of topics. It even comes with a helpful holding ring that you can put the cards on. I have not taken the AP Exam yet, but it has been helpful for my course so far.Also, it arrive very quickly when i purchased it from amazon and had no shipping damage.Overall: Good product, helpful study tool, well organizes, would recommend this product to others."
3,"Good, but not worth the $'s","The set of AP history cards are fairly good to study off of, but the price is a little high for something that most likely has been printed for several years. A list of all the card subjects and the cards numbered would have been a nice touch."
3,Not entirely enough,"overall, these cards are good but no great. they cant replace a prep book. they do a great job in reviewing the major ideas and concepts, but the lesser ones that the ap test might pick the cards arent much help there. and also, i didnt really like the format of teh cards. the bullets on the back aren't really bullets. they're like mini-paragraphs preceded by a dot."
5,wow,"Please dont sleep on this album, it is amazing. The debut album from Jerzee Monet is very powerful and moving. However, i think it will supprise most people who hear it. From hearing the first single, Most High, i assumed Jerzee was some sort of a gospel singer. While all her songs have a slow, could-be gospel beat, more of her songs are about love and relationships than God. Her melodic voice flows very well over the mellow beats, and her guests (limited to Eve, Ja Rule, and DMX) mix well with Jerzee's style. If you like Most High, and other songs that have a true meaning to them and are actually written for a reason, you will love this album."
4,Meaningful,Jerzee's CD is a wonderful Blend of music you do not find on a regular basis. Currently we have to many Airheads with ample assets that get more air play then artist that have true talent. Anyone with a good sound guy can fix their voice to sound sellable. not many can sing without electronic assistance.Jerzee is a true singer!
3,AN IMPRESSIVE DEBUT,"Like Des'ree's 1995 smash ""You Gotta Be"",New Jersey native Jerzee Monet's debut single ""Most High"" mixed inspirational messages in a contemperary style.""Most High"" stood out on urbanradio with Jerzee's reggae influenced delivery and it's plesantly positive message which promoted everything from self-respect to gun control.Good stuff.Jerzee spawns from ""Most High""into her own album,""Love & War"" which isn't actually isn't bad.""Respect"" stands out the most,like ""Most High"" it has a very positive message which highlights families.""Yeah""(featuring Eve),""Stop My Flow"",and the title track are also standouts.The only real drawback on ""Love & War"" is the misguided Ja Rule collabration,""Twisted"".Jerzee's voice is too pretty to get matched next to his and it just doesn't work.And as another reviewer suggested the songs could be longer.But that doesn't really stop ""Love & War"" from being a worthy debut disc."
2,Disappointing..,"I was so excited to buy this album and I was extremely disappointed with the content once I got it. The tracks sound kinda dated and it was hard for me to get passed that. I thought she was going to be breaking new ground and treading on new territory. Not! Same ole, same ole. Currently this album is collecting dust in my car. And yes, I tried to listen to it several times hoping there was something there. No dice.."
3,"Makes a good text book, but not recommended for fun reading.","As a music therapy major, this was the text book for my introductory course. It defines music therapy well and is a good tool for a music or creative arts therapist or student. If you are looking to simply explore the world of music therapy, I recommend the Mozart Effect book series, which is designed for people in and out of the field and is much easier to read."
3,This is Hella Good.,"This is actually the Japanese version of the Hella Good cd single. No live tracks, no new mixes. Just the same Hella Good that has been out for a while now but with Japanese labels."
