1,Disapointed,"After reading the Title I was expecting a great DVD audio experience. I put it in my car and could find where the set-up tests are hiding. In addition, the 8 songs that are included are not very good and I usually like all kinds of music. This Audio-DVD is far from the ultimate! I would not buy this and I am sending it back."
2,Review for The Ultimate DVD,"If I could have listened to this DVD before purchasing, I would not have bought it. This is called a DVD. I was expecting video with sound, I was disappointed with this sampler 5.1 set-up disc. Before I buy a demo again I want to be able to listen to it."
5,Acid Bath Fan's MUST HAVE,"I bought this DVD as soon as it came out and it didn't leave my DVD player for 3 weeks. If you like Acid Bath's music, don't falter- BUY IT! Although it lacks much music from Pagan Terrorism Tactics (which is no one's fault since Audie died so early in the tour), you do get the Toubabo Koomi video and some footage from practices. All the show footage makes you feel as close as you ever could to being there, which is always nice when you were too young to ever see them when they were touring. (I know... poor me!) If you enjoy Dax's (or Daks as he spells it now) vocals, also check out Agents of Oblivion. For the hardcore Daks fans, check out his latest band Deadboy and the Elephantmen on the web...(Deadboy is not at all like Acid Bath so do NOT say I didn't warn you. It's very melodic, dark and calmer.)"
4,Nice napkins...,"Bought this for my mom as part of a ""theme"" gift this year for Christmas. Nice quality napkins for a pretty good price!"
1,Ridiculously unnecessary,"The only time this book helped me make money was when I sold it back on Amazon. Elliot is ridiculous. Just learn to respect how your own mind recognizes and interacts with price; then see about basing a system around that. If Elliot ends up being your religion then fine, but for most people this will just make you want to pour acid on your retinas."
1,Don't read this book if you want to make money,"The Elliott Wave principle is dangerous to your financial health.Its a convincing theory that works very well in hindsight. The problem is that it doesnt predict the market successfully. Worse still the patterns can be so convincing (but in hindsight plainly wrong) that you trade your bias rather than the markets price behaviour.If you do read it apply the test of assuming the market makes a move up, down and sideways over the next 5 days. Then explain why it happened. Then ask yourself if there is any value in your current view.These guys get it wrong all the time and have been predicting the big crash regularly since 1987.Look instead for books by Van Tharp, William O'neil, Charles Le Beau and Alexander Elder."
5,Melodic punk at it's finest.,"There are not many CD's I have that I can honestly say I love every track, however after the 3rd spin this CD has not left my deck. I've listen to it over & over again & I LOVE IT. It gets me in a good mood. The lyrics are fantastic. The guitar in colorforms sends chills up my spine. Spam in in can, & Rich Kids are so catchy I think MTV should market a video for one of these songs any one of the songs would be an instant hit on TRL. Old School 101 are true to their name. OS101 & the Decendents are definitely my all time favorite bands EVER!"
2,Where did that 20 grand go?,"After seeing this incredibly long film, much much in DIRE need of editing, (being too in love with your own first feature sure clouds your judgement, doesn't it?) you wonder where these filmmakers put that 20 grand. Seems like with that kind of scratch, even shooting on film, you could pay the sound guy to back that dat away from the camera enough so the film reel sound doesn't end up on the final film. (Not to mention a fly buzzing...)This movie had about 2 points of merit: the fact that they finished it, being themselves inbred rednecks, and the condom scene in the grocery store.And what sad, sad casting. Oh, wait, I guess that's how you save money so you can shoot way too much footage: enlist the help of your very untalented friends.Let's just hope that Joshua has better luck on his little ghost hunts than he does making a film."
2,More like anklets!,"These socks have no elastic to hold them up, and even if they did, they'd still be too short to wear under slacks. I'm glad these were an inexpensive stocking stuffer!"
2,The Book That Wasn't,"I consider this a challenge because I never read the book, never heard of the book or ordered the book. What now?"
5,Great shampoo!,"I have severe allergies (specifically to avocado), and am also strongly opposed to animal testing. This shampoo was one of the few that fit the boll for both, as well as managing to clean my extremely thick hair. The smell is a light citrus, which is a nice change from the extremely perfumed shampoos I'm used. My hair is shiny, has volume, and looks great. This is a great product!"
5,Excellent!!! Easy to understand and use as a guide.,I could type 1000 'thankyou's. For those of us who grew up in an abusive envirionment subject to brutal aggressive behavior this book is a life saver. The easy to read and real-life style make it especially useful.My original exposure to this book was in a class I took prior to 1984. I still refer to it when ever I need to reinforce confidence in myself and my ability to behave in an assertive manner even when challenged by highly charged emotional situations.
1,Worked only once,"I purchased this grinder to mainly be used with my Cuisinart automatic drip coffee maker, with which I have been happy. This grinder worked great .... ONCE! When I went to use for the second time after purchasing it, it simply would not turn on despite my husband taking it apart cleaning it and assuring that everything is in right operating condition. I'm returning this to amazon and purchasing the Capresso which I should have done in the first place."
2,Have to babysit the grinder,"Due to a poor design flaw, we have to babysit the grinder as the coffee beans do not flow properly and they get hung up before the beans reach the grinder. We have to shake and/or slap the grinder to get the beans into the grinding/burr area, it will work for a while but then it gets hung up again as we grind for the 18 cup marker. This is extremely annoying."
1,you can keep this one.,"The Cuisinart DBM-8 has all the bells and whistles, and it will grind exactly as much coffee as you want, exactly the way you want it...However, after three weeks of use and trying 21 different ways to get the ground coffee out of the incredibly static plagued plastic hopper without getting ground coffee all over the kitchen (and yes that includes slowly and carefully using a brush), it has resisted every effort to do so. As a matter of fact, I have yet to figure out how to get the lid off the hopper without spilling the ground coffee that sticks to it, and have to do so in the sink so clean-up is minimal."
3,Does the job,"We love freshly ground coffee and this definitely does the job. The ability adjust the coarseness is the best feature. The draw back is how messy it is. You will get coffee grounds on your counter when using it. The grounds build up around the opening and in the corners, even when freshly cleaned. My husband hates this grinder but I am ok with it because I am a little more patient when scooping out the grounds. I use a spoon and am careful, other wise it is a huge mess. BOTTOM LINE - It works but will make a huge mess."
1,Whirrrrrrrrrrr (silence),"Worked great for one week, then quit. Cuisinart very disappointing when it comes to coffee products. Also have had terrible luck with their grind and brew coffee pot. The bright spot in this is that when I contacted the company, they were quite willing to send me a new one. I'll let you know if the new one performs any better."
5,Cuisinart Automatic Burr Mill,I am very satisfied with this coffee grinder. It has worked very well and produces the ground coffee to the selected coursness. It is easy to clean and has been trouble free.
1,I did not want to give a star. AVOID this product,Had to send the first grinder back. After two weeks high pitched whining begins and it won't grind. It is so messy I did not want another but I sent it back to get another. The second came and has died within a week. I will never buy this brand again
1,Junk,Used this grinder almost daily for about 2 months before it just completely stopped working. Totally unsatisfied with this piece of junk.
1,Broke after 4 months,"This seemed like a good idea at the time: good price, reputable brand, and enough good reviews to give one hope. And at first, we were pleased: a pretty nice, pretty fast grinder. But no dice. After just 4 months of light duty (I'd estimate that we ground fewer than 10 pounds of coffee) the motor suddenly ground to a halt. We had a Braun grinder that looked a lot like this one that lasted more than 10 years. I mean, c'mon Cuisinart, don't put your name on a substandard product. Folks, I seriously recommend you skip this one."
1,How is this a Burr Mill?,"In goes coffee beans, out comes dust, even at the coarsest setting. Almost unusable if you use a french press. To implication that this produces grounds anything like any other burr grinder ever is a boldfaced lie."
4,coffee grinder,"pros: Grinds well, esthetically pleasing cons: noisy/ coffee grinds cling to plastic grind reservoir, although I've heard this happens with the majority of grinders on the market"
3,Doesn't grind espresso,"I was very excited about getting this coffee grinder, but after bringing it home and trying to use it to grind beans for making espresso, I found out that it doesn't grind fine enough for espresso. Unfortunately, the espresso comes out light and watery because of this. That's really the reason I got this grinder as opposed to a cheaper one, because I thought I could have flexibility in what I could make fresh since I like espresso and my partner prefers regular coffee. The coffee it makes is really good, but I don't understand why it has so many settings if it can't make the full spectrum of coffee."
2,Makes a mess,"Well, it looks nice on the counter and the hopper is convenient, but we hate to use it. The coffee grinds are so static-y that they jump to all the nearby surfaces - the grinder, the counter, and the coffee brewer. Just makes a total mess. I tried all the hints people suggested after googling the problem (foil in the hopper, spraying water, spraying oil, touching the faucet and the grinder simultaneously, and even grinding in my bare feet) and it's still a pain.I truly regret this purchase."
4,"Works great, good value","We've had this for a month or so now and it's exactly what we needed, and exactly what I expected after reading the reviews here. Pros: we use for grinding coffee, finest setting works fine for espresso as far as we're concerned. Detachable parts clean up easily in the dishwasher. Cons: hard to clean the grinding parts and the unit itself, and the static buildup from the plastic. We generally grind once a week, so the cleanup isn't a big deal. I wouldn't want to try to clean it daily."
3,Okay grinder,"Its an okay grinder. Works just as its supposed to.Makes a nice consistent grind.Not recommended for the espresso buyers. Does not create fine enough grind.If your looking for an everyday grinder to use with your drip coffee maker or french press, perfect buy for you."
4,coffee grinder,"love the cuisinart products, and this is up there in quality. the burr grinder is a bit loud, but I have never used this type before. the brewed coffee is so good and love the convenience of being able to fill the hopper with the coffee beans, select the amount I need to grind and push the button. If you love coffee as much as I do, buy this!"
2,"Better than a blade grinder, by a bit","For the price, it's better than a blade grinder, and it will do an adequate job for drip coffee. The french press is not consistent and has a lot of dust which gets through the filter. It isn't fine enough for espresso.I recommend spending the extra for a conical burr grinder, even the Cuisinart one, because the quality goes up a lot."
4,Cuisinart DBM-8 Supreme Grind Automatic Burr Mill,"We were shopping for an automatic burr grinder because it was taking too long to grind using the antique crank grinder we had. This grinder seemed best to meet our needs. In the month we have had it it has worked well. It is a bit loud and the grind selection seems to have more settings than actual grinds, that is, two notches past medium seem to yield the same grind as five notches past medium, or two notches before medium make a coarser grind than expected. Minor stuff, once you get used to it. One problem we had was the cup selector was off and the grinder didn't shut off. After I moved the selector a couple of times, it worked again and hasn't given us any more problems. Overall I like this grinder and hope it lasts a while."
1,Poor Warranty policy--Beware!,The grinder worked great until one day it just died less than a year after purchase. No problem it was still under warranty. Well there was a problem. Cuisinart does not have any service centers so the company said I would have to pay the cost for returning the grinder and send them $10.00 to cover the cost of them shipping me a new one. Well I don't think that is much of a warranty. Because of this policy I will never buy another product of any type from Cuisinart. There are other reasonably priced burr grinders out there.
1,crapped out twice,we got this as a gift one xmas. i used it a couple of times and it stopped working. luckily my brother who is mechanically inclined figured out that it blew the internal fuse and fixed it. i continued to use it a couple of times after that and it started to smoke. i was afraid of fire so i stopped using all together. i expected more from the cuisinart brand. this is a piece of junk. i guess i will continue to grind coffee a little at a time with my tiny grinder that is years old and keeps on working no matter what. Evidently if you want a grinder that grinds a lot of coffee at a time spend so serious money and don't waste your time and money on these cheapo appliances.
1,Don't waste your time or money,I had this grinder for less that 2 months before it started going bad. It started not staying on for the automatic grinding. Then it was very touch to even run. I finally unplugged it when I noticed it was warm BEFORE I used it.This was also VERY noisey. The reviewer who said 106db is not a suprise to me. It is also a VERY high pitched grinding sound. My recommendation is to look for something else.
1,Works Great Until It Breaks,"My second unit broke after 6 months of use -- once per day. I currently have 3 of these machines (one broke today); 2 at one house because my wife and I like different blends, and one at my vacation home. Fortunately, I bought them from Costco, so they are all going back. Cuisinart customer service is worthless. Looking at the reviews here, looks like I'm not alone."
1,Not for nuts!,"This product was originally listed as a nut-butter machine. However, when I purchased it, I was surprised to find that the product was labelled coffee grinder and made no references to grinding nuts.Grinding nuts in this product was a total disaster. The hopper did not feed properly, and I would guess that coffee beans would have the same problem. This machine would not even grind the smallest nuts."
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this grinder, despite some of the reviews that I read, because I had previously owned a cuisinart grinder that I was very happy with. The thought of a grinder that would store the beans and I could quickly grind just what I needed sounded great. And it does give you options for your preferred grind, which is nice. However, it does NOT grind the amount that you select. It also does create huge amounts of coffee dust, as previous reviews suggested, that spreads well beyond the area that you are grinding. After 2 months of use, I have just ordered a new basic grinder, and this will be going to the out of use appliances shelf we have managed to maintain within our house."
2,"Yep, Ground to a HALT!","Well, This grinder lasted for 4mo. and 5 days. I have to say that while it worked, it worked pretty well. It clogs up pretty quickly though. I kept it fairly clean but after the last clog it just quit working altogether. I gave it two stars. For durability I'd have given it one. It did work well originally though."
1,Horrible!,"I wish I had taken a look at the reviews here before buying this mill. What a waste of time and money. I'm sending mine back while I still can. It does none of the things it's supposed to. It's grinds are completely inconsistant. No matter what the setting, you will get a grind that ranges from coarse to fine powder. With mine it is about 1/3 fine powder. Worse yet, it somehow gives this fine powder an electric charge that makes it impossible to get it from it's container to the pot without it flying all over the place. What a mess! What a piece of crap. I see there's a new model out now, and it looks like they've changed the look a little to hide the fact that it's still the same piece of junk that this one is. Beware!"
1,Junk !!,I have purchsed 3 of these units in the last 2 years. After only a few uses thay clogg up and stop grinding. Never again.
4,Good Home Grinder,"This is a good quality home grinder. It grinds to a consistent size, no matter what coarsness setting you have it on. Plus it allows for you to adjust the amount you want ground. I would highly recommend this to a coffee drinker for their home."
1,24 months and then it broke,"I was given this grinder two Christmases ago. I've used it daily on the fine setting. Others in the house have used it occasionally on the coarser settings. It worked until last month, when it wouldn't turn on. Taking it apart showed that the plastic hopper is mounted on top of a threaded, plastic pipe (which also forms upper edge against which the burr grinds). That pipe was cracked, and that prevented the hopper from seating fully on the two safety interlocks located on the top of the unit. We used it for a couple weeks by holding the hopper down by hand, but yesterday the pipe broke off completely (no great surprise there). I could hack it more deeply, but since the finest it could grind wasn't all that fine to begin with I'm going to go look for something nicer. Preferably something which grinds metal against metal, for starters."
2,Too Messy!,"We bought this grinder about a month ago, and the flying coffee grounds from the static is making me nutty! This is the first burr grinder I have purchased, and the coffee does taste better using this type of grinder. But between the mess from the static and the very loud noise the grinder makes, I think I chose the wrong one.Even though I've had this one a short time and it is working fine, I am thinking about purchasing another one with a glass container so there is less static."
1,Truly a piece of crap,"Only used it sporadically over the 1 year of useable life it was with me, and it just plain broke. Terrible is what I have come to expect from all Cuisinart products."
1,I'll return to my old brand,"After my Capresso died after 3 years of daily use, I decided to purchase the Cuisinart. It was less expensive. The design of the Cuisinart coffee bin makes it difficult to see the amount of beans remaining. The container for the ground coffee is difficult to empty without spilling, and is difficult to re-insert. And this grinder generates a lot more ""sludge"" than the Capresso."
3,I like the grinder very much until two weeks ago.,The grinder worked great for nine months then without warning it just quit. It did a good job and requires little maintenance. Called customer service and received a return notice. Hopefully they will send me another soon. It's been about two weeks since I sent it out.
4,2 year user,"This grinder has served well. All of the mentioned ""shortcomings"" ie. noise level and static cling of grindings in the hopper are true, but it is only a $49 burr grinder. Ours has just failed due to the motor burning out, but this is after 2+ years of use. We have used the grinder extensively, on some occasions grinding for 20 or more cups of brew on an occasion. I would buy this product again, unless a somewhat quieter model was close in price range."
1,Broke after 1 year,"I had purchased this from Sam's club and was never happy with it. First, its as loud as a jet engine and second, it broke after one year - just quit working."
1,Disappointed,"This served us for a few months, but then the motor burned out. Even before the motor burned out, this grinder would give us a small electric shock whenever we used it. It's disappointing because I'm usually happy with Cuisinart products. Oh well."
2,poor motor,Maybe I was just unlucky but this machine wore out in less than a year. The motor just gave up in the middle of grinding the beans. Vibration was always a big problem with the grinder as well. You have to hold it down or it walks across the counter.
2,mine just broke,"Ok, have had this for bit more than a year, and its my first grinder,worked well,and was looking on amazon to see what I would replace it with, and was unaware others rated it so high. However, it doesnt appear there are many choices in the same price range, and do not want to hold button down while I grind.I would hate to think that I will have to order the same thing; um yes the grounds do tend to stick to the plastic, but cant believe its any different for other grinders"
2,Failure within 1 year,"While cuisinart arguably makes products that look good, their quality is not good. We bought this model to use each morning to grind beans for a 6 cup pot of coffee. Less than one year after purchase, it has failed.You will spend your money better, elsewhere."
3,Just OK,"The grinder is noisy but it did the job. Like other plastic grinder containers, the static electricity will drive you nuts. After about 1 year, the motor just burned out."
4,"If it quits, maybe the motor did not burn out","I have had this grinder for a number of years. Couple of years ago we moved and upon arrival I plugged it in, loaded some beans and pressed the on button - Nothing. Now I know a little bit about these things & I was sure it was not the motor. long story short, I took the whole thing apart and found out it was the On/Off switch. I was able to find a replacement switch at Radio Shack, although the switch was much thinner than the original switch so I had to build it up so that the button on top would activate it. It now works like a champ. So, it may not be the motor etc. If you don't feel qualified to take it apart, take it to a shop that repairs small appliances & suggest that the problem might be the On/Off switch. I have a feeling that these switches are really cheap."
1,Cuisinart junk,"The only Cuisinart product I own that still works is their old food processor which I have had for years so I thought their other products would be as good WRONG every single Cuisnart product I have bought in the last few years has failed after a very short time , I have taken them back to the store for replacement and the story was the same every time. The coffee grinder I hardy used died today as well . So I have sworn NEVER to buy ANY of their products again along with Maytag products which before being sold out made some the best products your money could buy . Not anymore . I think they make more of you byselling repair parts ! I know they have me . Hope this review saves someone some money !"
2,didn't work for long,Have bought two of these grinders and they just don't hold up. Will spend more to get one that will last.
1,Motor failed after three months,"After using this daily for three months, the motor burned itself out this morning. Surely we can find a burr grinder made in the U.S. that outlasts this good-for-three-months version from China. What a disappointment."
2,Worked great 'til it died.,We used this coffee grinder almost daily for almost three years at our three person office and then it just died. Sounds like a gear or something is worn or just plain broken because the motor runs the but grinding mechanism doesn't sound like it is spinning any more. As an alternative I would suggest a KitchenAid Pro coffee grinder which we have had at home for about five years and has been absolutely trouble free.
2,Fine grind is not fine enough,"After reading other reviews, I bought this grinder thinking it would be great for brewed coffee and good enough for my Krups espresso machine. It is noisy as other reviews have noted. The grind in good for brewed coffee but that was on almost the finest grind setting. It is nowhere close enough for an espresso machine, even on the finest setting - don't even consider it for espresso!"
3,Early Failure but honest Warranty,"The coffee mill has an 18-month warranty.My wife uses it about once per week, certainly not excessively, so we were surprised when it failed. (Just lost power, able to turn the wheel by hand so don't think it was jammed.)I was going to take it apart, but did a quick check and discovered that it was one week within the Cuisinart 18 month warranty. Called them, and was politely given return instructions. Sent it to them (at our expense) by Priority Mail eight days ago.Today we were pleasantly surprised when UPS delivered a new DBM-8 coffee mill.Hope this one lasts a bit longer!"
2,Not for espresso!,"Really thought that this grinder would do the job. Purchased one a bit over a year ago and it has done a very fine job at grinding an espresso fine grind. Attempted to purchase a matching unit for decaf. To my disappointment, after purchasing and returning three machines the later crop of machines is incapable of a fine grind. Tried the same bean that was grinding very fine in the older machine to no avail. I'll have to look elsewhere. Before purchase of the third machine I contacted Cuisinart and they believed it had to be a bad batch because they have had NO complaints. They sugested that the subsequent machine be purchased from another retailer. Did just that. Strike Three!"
2,"OK to grind, messy to use","Grounded coffer power is statically charged and spray into the plastic container, which does not help to discharge. Even after days, when open the container to use the coffee, some powder still erratically project around due to the static. Manufacturer should use a metal one."
2,A waste of $ if you want an fine grind,"I looked over the other reviews here, and they are generally positive. It is true that this is a nice machine because; one, it is not messy; two, it is not too loud; three, you can grind without having to stand there holding down a button; and four, it does hold a fair amount of beans. That said, I gave this grinder a poor score because its FUNDAMENTAL purpose is to grind the beans. In other words, I weighted this purpose as being extremely important. And so, the poor score because even on the finest setting I cannot get an espresso grind! I cannot imagine what grind you would get on coarse.. would the whole beans just come out whole? Maybe it works in reverse and grinds would come out whole again--that's how bad this thing is. You would never have to worry about it clogging and overheating, I guess....A waste of money if you want fine grind. I had a krups--going back to Krups."
2,OK for standard drip coffee makers,This grinder only produces coffee suitable for drip coffee makers. The fine setting isn't fine enough for espresso and the coarse setting still leaves lots of fine powdery dust that renders it unsuitable for use with a French press -- the resulting coffee is just too bitter.
1,Cuisinart misses the mark,"When they list ""ultra fine"" as one of the grind features, it is reasonable to assume this means fine enough for espresso. NOT SO! I like to make espresso a couple times a week but this machine does not allow me. And the company's response is formula, basically non-response. My estimation of Cuisinart went way down with this item, after being pretty high before based on very good food processor."
2,Lasted 2 weeks,Motor stopped working after only 2 weeks. A replacement model did not grind fine enough for good espresso.
5,I love this grinder!,"Now maybe it's because I had one of those cheap hand held grinders, but I really do love this grinder. I don't see any negatives about it... all grinders create a little powder, and the powder that this machine creates, stays in the container... besides, it doesn't change the coffee which is our ultimate goal right? A good cup of coffee... A+ Highly recommend this grinder!"
3,Good grinder but breaks too easily,"When you get the grinder new, it works just fine. But after a short time (couple months) it breaks down. I had this happen to two of them and though I was pleased with the grinding of the coffee, I will not buy another."
1,Short Life,"Original quit. Cuisinart replaced it. Replacement quit. Appeared to be same problem. Service couldn't find my original registration card however they could tell me the serial number of the original unit. How can that be? Would not honor their 18 month warranty because they calculated, from the serial number, the date of manufacturer instead of Date of Purchase. Could not give me any technical support or any quality answers or referals. Buyer beware."
4,Works but it is noisy,This Cuisinart grinding mill does an excellent job of grinding coffee. At half the cost of other mills it is quite a good bargain. My wife prefers a very fine grind which it does an outstanding job. I it weren't so noisy it would have gotten a 5. It cleans up easily and stores well and it will handle 1/2 pound of coffee in the hopper.
4,Sturdy and consistent.,This is the second one of this brand and type I've owned and I'm sure it won't be the last. It does a good job and I'm very happy with it overall.
2,Loved it until it broke,"This was a great grinder. The cup measurements made it easy to determine water ratio and the different settings for fine/course grounds were great for our different brew methods. I would be giving it a 5, but unfortunately it stopped working after a couple months."
4,Great value for a conical burr,"I've had this grinder for 2 years now, and it is a great value for a conical burr.Regarding static. I used to laugh at the reviews complaining about static electricity. This winter, after 18 months of use, my grinder started having the same challenges. Now it is somewhat impossible to transfer the ground coffee to your machine or drip system without grinds going everywhere. My solution is to wipe the counter with a wet cloth after using, and sweep the floor more often. I anticipate the problem will lessen as the humidity levels rise throughout spring/summer. I also own a Maestro Plus, and that grinder has no static electricity problems but did cost 3 times as much."
1,Not Durable,Within a month I could tell that it wasn't grinding as well as it had when I first got it. I opened it up within a couple months to see what was wrong and the plastic inside the hopper had broken in a couple different places. Very cheap. Keep looking.
1,gourmet morning drinker,"I have bought 2 of these pieces of junk, made in China, in the last 3 years. The plastic threads on the hopper break, This is not sturdy enough for a burr grinder."
1,Lacking.,The grinder worked great but for me after 1 month of use it seized up. Every cleaning lasts for 1 pot before the motor slows and begins to burn itself up.
5,So far so GOOD,Grinds the coffee to a fluffy consistency that gives the apperance of to much for the pot. But it produces much more coffee taste for the same amount of beans. Gave one to my daughter for Cristmas and she loves it.
3,Loud grinder,I bought this item two weeks ago and have used it to grind a total of two pound of coffee. Although it looked like a good idea to get a burr grinder (I thought it would be quicker and quieter) it turns out my standard mill grinder does the job just fine. I do like the fact you can set the grind for fine to coarse but eliminating this the less expensive and quieter and quicker mill grinders suit my needs just fine. The machine states it grinds a half pound at a time but in reality the hopper holds about this much and it takes three or four cycles to empty the hopper. We are returning ours and going with the older mill grinder. Think twice before you buy.
4,Great grinder for the price...,"Overall this grinder is great for the average or beginner coffee ""aficionado."" While it is not as stylish and my not produce as consistent of a grind as some of it's competitors, at 1/2 to 1/3 of the cost it is perfectly suitable for numerous uses. It grinds fine enough for my pump-driven espresso machine and coarse enough for my french-press, though there is still a small amount of ""powder"" noticeable in the cup, but I've yet to see a noncommercial grinder that does better. You will need to further process the grinds for turkish-style coffee but for everything else it outperforms the other sub-$100 burr grinders."
3,Good....but short lived.,"I really liked this grinder...it works well, grinds coarse for percolator, and the coffee tastes really swell. However, I have had two of these grinders, and both died at about eight months of age. They have an 18 month warranty, and Cuisinart did send me a replacement when the first one died....but....you would think they would come up with a way to extend the life of this product."
2,Not even good enough,"I used it for about 1 minute before I had to pack and send it back. I needed this for espresso which is finer than american or french coffee. At the finest setting, the results would only be good for drip coffee. I would have given this a better rating had it been my mistake or misunderstanding, but they talk up their 18 settings and the appropriateness of the machine for any type of coffee! Also, the machine is quite messy, even for the brief first use, it spat bit of coffee and dust out of machine, as well as leaving lots static particles in and out of the containers. I returned it because it did not suit my need. It obviously has worked for many others!!!"
4,Good and Bad,"This grinder has revolutionized my coffee drinking. It is good because it delivers a fairly consistent grind for my drip coffee makers. It is bad because it does make some dust from the beans, no matter the grind setting. It is also REALLY loud. Still, it doesn't leak when grinding, is not too hard to clean and didn't cost too much."
2,"Cheap, loud and junky","Stay away. Bought it for around $50 to supplement my tiny grinder. Used it only for about 6 times and died. Maybe it's too ""automatic"".Meanwhile, my tiny grinder ($20 Braun) is still working after 5 years."
2,Cheap but proportionately loud,"I bought this grinder because the price was right, but in this case you get what you pay for. The unit is unbelievably loud. And not just loud: It has a screaming edge to the noise that is surprisingly unpleasant. It wakes everyone up in the house when it's run, even with all doors closed, and we're afraid to use it in the morning with house guests. Although it has otherwise operated perfectly for us for a couple of years, I'm going to replace it with something quieter!"
1,Could be really dangerous,I've had the grinder about 8 months and twice it would not shut off even when I put it in the OFF position and I had to unplug it. When I plugged it in again it seemed ok. This morning we were awakened by a deafening roar and it had started BY ITSELF with no coffee in it! It was good we were home as it would have burned the motor out and could possibly start a fire. Scary! Have no idea how that could happen. Cuisinart will replace (minus shipping) but don't think I want another one. I would leave this unit unplugged when not using.
1,It was fine...until it wasn't.,"At first, it seemed to work fine. It wasn't wonderful, but for $45 I didn't expect perfection. There was a good deal of static, but that's to be expected with a plastic bin. Unfortunately, exactly 6 months to the day after buying it, it has died. And while I didn't expect perfection for $45, I did expect it to last longer than half a year. It looks like I'll have to look for something better made (i.e. more expensive) now. I think I'll also look at a local store, because I've passed my 30 day window in which I could have returned it to Amazon. Oh well; live and learn I guess. :("
2,Not nearly fine enough for espresso.,"Bought this one for making espresso, but the finest setting still makes it to coarse."
4,very pleased,product was delivered promptly and product delivered as reviewed. I am very pleased with this purchased and hope to continue doing business with Amazon if this level of service continueslee c
2,too LOUD!,We have to leave the room when it's grinding. Cakes up and becomes difficult to remove hooper.
2,Not recommended,"This thing has become the bane of my mornings, it jams all the time despite regular cleaning. Then when I clean it out it won't start again for about 10 minutes once put back together."
1,Died after first use - hard to clean,I was given this as a present. The motor died after the first use and it's very difficult to clean.
2,could it be louder?,"me: ""why is this thing so loud?""husband: ""what?""good god....breaking the sonic barrier...."
3,Pretty good,"Does a nice job of grinding, but it is very noisy and it's hard to get the ground coffe out neatly"
5,Mine has worked well for 2 years,"I have been very pleased with this coffee grinder. I grind oily dark French Roast coffee exclusively and I am quite pleased with the consistency of the fine grind that this machine produces. the only problem I have had is that it clogs from time to time, not dropping beans from the hopper into the grinding portion of the device. Because the volume of ground coffee is time dependent, when this happens the measure of coffee isn't accurate. The problem occurs because the oily nature of the coffee produces some slight stickiness that keeps the beans from flowing through. Cleaning the throat of the machine fixes the problem. It grinds more quickly than my previous burr grinder, a long-discontinued Salton that lasted for 20 years. The Cuisinart is still going strong after 2 years but I don't expect that it will last for 20. I hope that I haven't put a jinx on it by writing this review."
3,Good while it lasted.,"I bought this grinder a little over two years ago. I bought it for the sole purpose of grinding beans for espresso (using the fine setting). It worked fine. I agree with the other reviewer who commented on the static build up. I couldn't do anything with that grinder without getting grounds EVERYWHERE. However, it did what I wanted it to. It was easy to clean and easy to maintain.About a month ago, I noticed that my grounds were not coming out fine anymore. I did everything I could to make sure there wasn't anything stuck inside. I made sure that I wasn't doing anything stupid. Finally I emailed the company off their own web site. To my surprise they called my on my house phone. The representative said that since the item only had an eighteen month warranty, I was pretty much out a coffee grinder. I couldn't have it repaired or anything. I was just out."
5,Really nice to have,"Bought this because all the lit on the net suggested that one needs a ""burr grinder"" to properly grind coffee beans. Have started to drink 100% Kona coffee so figured I should buy a good mill.Bought this one and am very satisfied. Has adjustments for grind size, nice hopper,cleans easily, what more could one want.Be sure to check the price at Costco first ( I didn't)."
4,Great overall but not coarse enough for French Press,"Overall this works well. It's simple to use, fairly quite, fully automatic and grinds exceedingly well for everything from uber-fine espresso to fairly coarse drip machines. Unfortunately even at the most coarse setting, many of the grounds still sneak through the French Press screen. I use French Press only occasionally, but I'm thinking of returning this for something that handles a fine grind. I really don't need 18 settings...just two, and one of those two really doesn't quite cut it.Still you will like this machine if you mainly do espresso or drip."
3,1st BurrMIll,"The Cuisinart DBM-8 was purchased as we enjoy whole bean coffee freshly ground and our B&D; grinder died. We looked on Amazon and they had what we thought was a good brand, CuisinartBurr Mill for a decent price. It worked great 5 days afterChristmas.speedy delivery. week 3 it stopped. Nothing,Nada. Contacted Amazon about problem. Will send replacement at once no charge plus return ticket no charge. Had new grinder in 3 days. Wow!! Repacked in original pkg and sent USPS.Thanks Amazon for Great Service. We use it every day and enjoy our coffee.Jim Carradine Sr."
2,The same part breaks every time!,"I've bought and replaced this piece of equipment three times and every time the part attaching the top grinder blade to the funnel fails because it's made of cheap plastic. It works great other than that, but it sucks that I can't get coffee this morning because somebody decided to spend 3 cents on a piece of plastic rather than 5."
3,mixed feelings,The grind is always great but the front receptacle where the grinds are deposited shouldn't be made of plastic as static is a big issue when transferring the grinds-this could also be helped by having a more coffee-transfer-friendly design.
4,No problems after 2 years of occasional use,"We've had this grinder for over 2 years and use it about 2-3 times a week. So far we've had no issues. I've never owned another grinder and bought this one only because I heard burr grinders give the best result and this was the cheapest burr ginder I could find at the time. I admit the coffee is far superior to any we've bought pre-ground. My only complaint is the cheap plastic bin that catches the ground coffee. It gets terrible static cling and makes a mess when you try to dump the coffee. Ours also has a tiny crack after two years. We have not put it in the dishwasher or dropped it. This does not affect the functionality, but I do wonder how much longer it will last."
1,Motor Burnout,"After the initial excitement about the purchase of this coffee grinder, reality quickly set when the motor burn out after about 6 months. I got a replacement unit from Cuisinart which then only took two months for the motor to burn out. I am extremely disappointed with the product."
1,Poops out after a few years' use,"I purchased this coffee grinder (from a local shop) about 2 years ago to replace my first grinder (purchased 25 years earlier). I chose the Cuisinart DBM-8 because it was the same model purchased way back when (when manufactured by another company). However, the Cuisinart machine died this morning, functioning for less than 10% the lifespan of the first grinder. It had never ground coffee according to setting. Whatever the setting, it produced fine grounds mixed with a high degree of dust, which meant the machine frequently clogged. Although it was easy to clean, dust is subpar for french press coffee. Yes, I should have returned it earlier (when it was still under warranty - 18 mos.), but that's water under the bridge now. Anyway, I just wanted to chime in about this machine as I am shopping for its replacement this morning, which may be a Bodum model."
3,Re-evaluating Cuisinart grinder,Our first cuisinart grinder stopped about a year after purchase. It was replaced and the second stopped less than a year later. Very disappointed. Not worth purchasing. Never again....Cuisinart however did make good on replacement of second grinder...and it is working well. So I am re-evaluating my negative criticism. I will now give it 3.5 stars. And I do appreciate the second replacement by Cuisinart.
2,"For the price, expected better reliabilty","This product became unreliable after only a year of use. It got to the point where it would only grind if the slide switch on top was 'wiggled', and after a few more months it now will not work at all.I spent significantly more on this brand expecting quality, I am very disappointed."
4,"Easy, reliable","This is our first burr grinder and we've been pleased with its ease and reliability. Clearly it works best for those who use ordinary beans and don't need to switch beans or grinds often. The hopper is easy to keep clean with just a small paint brush. It's very pleasant to just press once, empty into the coffee maker, press one more button and the aroma of freshly ground coffee announces breakfast. In more than a year we've noticed no degradation in motor performance."
3,Not bad for an inexpensive grinder,"I've had this grinder in daily use for about 18 months. The grind is good, but not great, in that there is some inconsistency - mostly that the grinder always produces a bit too much ""fines"" no matter what the setting. Since the grinder has a plastic box which is prone to static cling, the fines also tend to build up over time. The grinder is louder than I would like. I take the edge off that by tossing a dishtowel or two over the top. Finally, I'd like a larger capacity bean hopper. Still, for the money, it's not bad! It's a workhorse. I've never had a single problem with it, and the burrs never seem to dull. If you're looking for a reasonably-priced upgrade from a blade grinder, this is one to consider."
1,Already broken!!!,"I bought this coffee grinder several months ago and it did a GREAT job of grinding coffee. Unfortunately, the piece of plastic that holds the hopper to the base has broken. The coffee grinder now will only work when I manually press down on the hopper while the motor is running. Major aggravation, espcially on the really fine grind setting. This grinder feels more substantial than it actually is. Mercifully, I still have the little Krups grinder that I've had for over 20 years!"
4,Expresso Grinding not a problem,"First of all I'd like to say that the price of this item in the UK is about 60 pounds sterling - a lot more expensive than in the US but still a lot cheaper than the Kitchen Aid machine that retails at about 130 pounds. That said, I am pleased with the machine. I use it to grind beans for a Gaggia Classic expresso machine and I find that I do not need to use the finest setting to produce a good shot that takes about 20 seconds.The machine is quite loud but no more so than other burr grinders I have heard. As to how long it will last I will wait to see but here in the UK we get a 5 year warranty!"
2,#7 plastic,I never used the coffee grinder because I noticed that where the grinds go and where you store the coffee they are made with plastic #7. Anyone who does not know about this plastic should research it before buying this mill.
1,Cheap . . . and it shows,"The advantage of burr grinders is that they (supposedly) provide a consistent grind. The Cuisinart? Not so much. Even the courser grind settings deliver a fair quantity of powdery overground coffee. I just got it a couple of weeks ago, so I can't comment on how long it will last, but it's a poor performer out of the box."
2,Energy Drain When Not In Use,"The pro is that the coffee grinds are consistent in both quality and quantity. The issue I have with this grinder is the energy it sucks up sitting on the counter. Amazon sells 'Kill A Watt', which measures the energy used by household appliances. According to this device this grinder zaps over $6.00 of electricity a year.It might be excusable if it had a timer or clock, but it doesn't. Not even a light. All it has is a simple switch that starts the grind when pressed. I called the manufacture's customer service thinking that maybe the unit was defective. The rep verified with their engineers that it was the way it was designed.Surely their designers/engineers are smart enough to create a product with a simple 'ON' switch that doesn't waste energy when not in use."
2,no good for expresso,"I was given this as a present for grinding coffee for expresso. However, as noted in the previous comment, even at its finest, it isn't fine enough for an expresso machine. Maybe it was never intended to be used for expresso, although it doesn't say so in the ad."
2,Product life too short,"Bought just less then 2 years ago and used to grind for a pot every day. The power button is failing. I would expect a company to be able to built a Coffee grinder to have a product life similar to, oh, I don't know, maybe a coffee maker. I still use a $25 B&D coffee maker that has lasted 10 years now and a $50 Cuisinart coffee grinder that can't even make it to 2 years. When it comes to replacing this item, I guess I'll follow probably the wisest words to come out of our leader. 'Fool me one same on me..........fool me......you can't get fooled again.'"
2,Poor for High Pressure espresso makers,"I have a Gaggia Classic that requires an extremely fine grind, otherwise, the shots are way too short. My Braun KMM30 just died so purchased the Cuisinart. The finest setting sends the brew through in about 10 seconds (way too fast). Also seems that the grind is thready, not consistent. Probably fine for lower pressure systems."
3,"Overall OK, but great for the price","The grinder works well, not very noisy and does not take too much space. I think that for the price, this is a great deal. But this price comes with caveats. The French press coarse settings are good in terms of the resulting grain size, but they are not very consistent. Also, there is some dust and removing ground coffee can leave a bit of a mess. But overall, these are minor points, given the price. If the price were $200+, I would definitely return the item, but at $50 it's an excellent value."
1,Doesn't last long enough,"I am on my second Unit of this model. The first one only lasted six months so I thought it was just a fluke and got another one.What was I thinking?? This one lasted another six months and now will not process the coffee. Took it all apart, cleaned it- works fine if no beans in the bowl!!Going to spend more money this time and get a better quality grinder"
3,Decent grinder,"Purchased this unit December 2004 and it did a great job with all grinds EXCEPT expresso. The Expresso grind just is not fine enough for most expresso enthusiasts, myself included. The unit finally died on me a couple weeks ago after nearly 7 years of daily use. I dissected the unit and discovered that the circuit board had water damage (no one in the household is owning up to this...) which caused the timer to short. I had to bypass the timer & on/off switch to limp me through, but now I must manually start and stop by the plug.The only reason I do not rate this unit 5 stars is 1) it's too loud to warrant five stars, 2) the expresso grind is subpar.Over all a good unit and I have just ordered another one."
1,I wish I could give it a zero,"Worked great for six months, then died. Not worth the mess either, grinds flew everywhere when you removed the top of the bin where the grounds were.DIED IN SIX MONTHS. DON'T BUY IT."
1,cuisinart coffe grinder,"I bought this grinder for grinding flax seed , it did the grinding just OK but after few minutes it need resting, it is frustrating since the resting time seem to get longer and longer, kind of reminding me of an italian strike. but the worse is the cleaning, take me hours to get to all the little hiding places , I would not buy this item again I am currently looking for something else , this one will go caput."
2,Doesn't Have Staying Power for This Price,Ny Cuisinart Coffee Grinder (which I loved) didn't have a long life. Very disappointed in this company.
2,Not built to last,"Although I found the grinder to generally work well enough while it was working, mine just failed after less than a year. A plastic piece inside the assembly broke...I superglued it and it broke again in a different spot. Even while working it would clog periodically and require cleaning."
3,"It's okay, but not up to Cuisinart standards","Having a small hopper that holds half a pound of coffee is nice, having a small hopper that collects the ground coffee without grounds going on the counter is nice.But it grinds too finely even on the coarsest setting for use with my vacuum coffee maker. If you use filtered drip, expresso maker or chemex pot you will be all set."
1,Burrrrrr-out,"Only had the Grinder for 3 months, AND only used about 4 days a week for one pot at a time. The Motor is already burnt out. I could handle the dark roast coffee's just fine. But a few weeks of medium roast coffee sent this grinder into a flame-out. Worked great when it lasted... RIP..."
1,Another one bites the dust...,"We too are sorry to say that after 3 months of use our grinder also stopped working. It worked just o.k. while it lasted. The complaints posted by others are 100% accurate. I only wish that I had read the reviews before purchasing! Please, don't waste your money."
3,A decent grinder,"We have had this grinder for about 1 year now. It is still going strong. There are a few things that we don't like about our grinder.1. Like other's have mentioned there is some static that can be messy and annoying.2. It is super loud.3. The grind settings did not go low enough for the espresso shots we were pulling so my husband had to ""fix"" it, whatever he did made is so that we could turn the setting a good ways past fine, into ultra fine grind. However I think the machine is not please with it's new abilities, it has been acting like it is going to die any time now so I am shopping around for a new one just because of the grind settings.Good Luck with your shopping!"
4,Sturdy Styling Unit,"We've had the burr mill for over a week now getting daily use. Its very easy to use, adjustable for amount of coffee being brewed and size of grinds. Unit is very easy to clean and its easy to pour the grounds into a coffee maker filter. If you do get some buildup on the side or front of the where the ground coffee sits, simply tap gently against the counter and the problem will be eliminated. This is a styling unit that gets the job done."
4,Great Grinder,"This is our second grinder...the first one just wore out from years of use. Great bargain for the money, but make sure you grind you coffee before going to bed or you will wake the entire house up in the morning..it is noisey!"
3,"Great design, but the grind leaves a little to be desired","Luckily for me I have a pain in the butt Breville espresso maker that won't take finely ground coffee, but if I had a better machine I would have returned this grinder as the finest grind setting on it isn't extremely fine. It seems to be a great match for my espresso maker though so I am satisfied. The design of the grinder is great. The storage compartment is convenient (especially if you've ever used one of the small grinders). If you're one of those with a really nice espresso machine I would spend the extra money for a nicer grinder or you will probably be disappointed. If you have a lower end espresso machine or normal drop coffee machine this grinder will do the trick."
5,Cuisinart DB8 Coffee Grinder,"We have been using this grinder for about a month now and are delighted with it. Each pot of coffee is consistent (unless we accidentally change a setting) and the coffee is ground just the way we want it. For the price, we couldn't have done any better! We are enjoying the best coffee we have had at home ever!Yes, the chamber is plastic and static electricity holds some coffee to the wall, but that is easily remedied with a coffee brush. While I haven't tried one yet, there are a lot of products that remove or reduce static and if those extra 5 seconds of cleaning ever get to me, I will try one. However, for the price, I can't find anything that will beat it.I highly recommend this product."
4,mega grinder,"I recently purchased the Cuisinart DBM-8 grinder after my Krups grinder failed after 1 year. So far the Cuisinart is holding up quite well to twice daily use but there are a couple of minor details that could use a bit of improvement.First, Cusinart touts the fact that the bin will hold up to a half pound of beans. Unfortunately, I prefer to alternate the varieties of coffee I use so there is absolutely no advantage in pouring a half pound in at a time. This fact also made it a bit tricky to correctly estimate the amount of beans needed for a single pot. ( Perhaps adding some sort of measurement indicators on the bin would help?)Second, the bin holding the ground beans is extremely difficult to slide back in, a flaw the Krups had as well."
3,Decent grinder for the price,"We upgraded from our old Krups blade whirly grinder for this burr mill unit. So far it's been working without issues after 6 months of use and 8+ pounds of beans. This unit does suffer from the static issues, in that the collection bin is made of plastic and causes the ground coffee to stick to the walls and will make a mess when you open the lid to pour out the coffee. We're ready to try a better burr mill grinder now.GOOD:- Affordable- Nice looks- Adjustable grind settings- Auto shut off- Grinds designated amount of beans, so it's hands freeBAD:- Very LOUD!- Plastic bin produces static grounds, making a mess- Inconsistent grind- Produces clumpy grind- Clogs- Hard to clean due to design"
1,stoped working 3 months after purchase,"We got this product because he had the identical one for 8 years prior. We don't know if the first one was made in the USA but we sure know that the most recent one we bought was made in China. One could tell that the sound of the motor runing was not the same as the first one. At any rate, the second one looked identical to the first one but it was garbage. It stoped working less that 3 months after purchase. I wish I can get a refund."
1,Very Poor Quality,"I've had this grinder for just over two months and it has stopped working. This grinder was ordered to replace an identical grinder that stopped working after the Cuisinart warranty expired. I was hoping the problem was limited to the first machine that died. It wasn't. It is too late to return the item to Amazon, but it is covered by the Cuisinart limited warranty. Unfortunately, I have to pay for shipping this defective merchandise back to Cuisinart and send them a check for $4 so they can send me a replacement, that I hope will last longer than this inferior specimen. I did give the machine one star, because when it functions, it does a pretty good job. I guess it is worth the $10 to get a replacement from Cuisinart, but it's a close call."
2,Fine until it smoked....,"We used this fairly reliable grinder for almost 8 months, primarily for medium grind then later for coarse (French press). One morning as it was grinding away (or so we thought)...smoke began pouring from the seams and the smell of electrical parts burning was overwhelming. Unplugged & cleaned...don't bother trying to dismantle to get a look at the grinders, it is expertly sealed...then tried to start it up again...more smoke. Seems a +/- $50.00 grinder ought to last at least a year???"
2,"Not a good choice for espresso, but might help break your lease","Got the ""Supreme Grind"" and only kept it for one day before returning it. Despite its coffee-house looks, it's cheaply built and horrendously noisy--don't use this at night in an apartment if you like your neighbors. Despite the snarl of its (apparently well-hidden) jet engine, it does a very inconsistent and inadequate job. Even at its finest setting, it produces coffee bean chunks that vary from drip-grade coarse to not-so-fine. If you've got an espresso machine that won't give you that crema unless you feed it consistently finely ground coffee, you'll be disappointed with this grinder. Your espresso machine will blow water through the coarse bits and give you 15-second weak shots. On the other hand, if you need a grinder for drip/filter or French press coffee, this grinder will probably satisfy you since that equipment isn't nearly as ""picky"" as espresso machines are."
2,Don't buy it,"We have had 3 of these in 3 years. The first one stopped working. The 2nd one wouldn't stop grinding. The third one just died. I have lots of Cuisinart products and I love every one of them except this product. It's just not reliable, but it works great before it breaks!"
1,Do not waste your money,"This is the second one of these that have just stopped working. I thought I was just unlucky with the first one and got a lemon, but now the second one has stopped working after 19 months. I contacted the company and they said they would only talk to me if the product was less than 18 months old. Convenient huh?"
2,Dogs love this grinder. People beware.,This grinder has two major problems. The first is that it is very loud. It is so loud that my dog merrily joins in howls along with its air-raid siren like whine. He loves this grider. The second problem is that the coffee plugs up in the grinder and jams the motor. When this happens you must turn it off before the motor start smoking. A knife works well for chipping the ground coffee from the grinder. Several reviewers have mentioned that it died within a year and I suspect that it's because they were too slow about turning it off when it jams.I do not recommend this grinder (but my dog does).Update: after only 6 months the grinder stopped working. Luckily Costco took it back for a full refund. The warranty required me to pay shipping and send $$. I was very happy to unload it and will never again buy Cuisinart products.
2,Poor Long Term Choice,This grinder worked great for about two years--used most every day. A week ago I started having the same problem as another reviewer on this site with the grind switch working intermittantly. Now the motor has completely ceased. When I called the company they told me the grinder was warranted for 18 months and they were aware of motors that died shortly thereafter.
1,A Pricey Lemon,"I bought this grinder less than a year ago and, apart from its noise, it seemed to grind well. I liked the storage bin on top. However, last night it died completely. When I called the store where I bought it, the manager said that they only would exchange it within 90 days of purchase, with the receipt. She said I'd have to mail it back to the vandor. Having moved house since I bought it, I have no proof of purchase. My previous grinder, by Krups, lived 20 years. Guess what brand I'll buy now."
1,Piece of Junk,"First let me say that Costco has this grinder for $24.99 and it is not worth it. The grind is very inconsistant. Do not buy this grinder for use with an espresso machine or french press. No matter what setting I try to use, there is a layer of very fine coffee dust on top of the grinds. Also, several full beans have managed to make it past the burrs and into the hopper without a scratch. My old blade grinder works better than this Cuisinart piece of junk."
2,Died today,"This has been a reasonably good grinder for the last eight months. It was less noisy than the blade types, and convenient in that you can load your beans and walk away. It should have lasted longer than it did, however, so off to the next brand."
3,"Annual, not a perennial",My first machine died after 11 months. It was replaced under warranty but the company rep told me that the new unit would carry no warranty at all. It lasted one year. Suddenly today would make noise but grind nothing. Smoke came out of the motor. If you make coffee everyday be prepared to buy this grinder again and again and again.
2,After a Year,"I've had it nearly a year and like all Cuisinart products I've had they look and work great... for one year. It just quit working. It's the fourth Cuisinart product I've had that has done this. If you want to get it at this great price do it, but be prepared to buy a new one pretty soon.Looking back at my previous reviews I saw that after my third Cuisinart coffee maker went out I said, ""Some people never learn"". Wow. Guess I've only myself to blame for continuing to buy them :) I'm going to chalk it up to the fact that I like the style of Cuisinart. Sadly, it appears they focus on the surface appeal of their products and scrimp on the actual functionality."
1,Does not grind for expresso and stopped working within a year,"My grinder just ground to a halt this morning, about a year after I purchased it in a local store. I wasn't happy with it from the start because it does not grind fine enough for expresso! Just well enough for drip...this is the second Cuisinart product that's died on me within a year of purchase...the other was a juicer. I thought that Cuisinart was a solid brand...or it used to be!"
1,"Grinds well, doesn't last","When it works, this product grinds well and is convenient.That said, my first one ran well for several weeks, then simply would not start again. Cuisinart replaced it under warranty. Same story for the second one; ran well for several weeks, then, for no obvious reason, stopped working.Being an electronics engineer, I took it apart, thinking that it might be a simple failure that could be fixed with a soldering iron. Everything looked just fine inside. There must be an over-stressed component that does not fail in an obvious way.I would love to love this product, but there is something in the design that is poorly chosen. The engineers who designed this grinder should be ashamed of themselves. I am giving up on the product because of very poor reliability."
1,AVOID: short life and poor grind,"While this machine lasted about 2 years, I only used it an average of twice a week. Worse is the fact that its finest grind setting is woefully inadequate for good espresso. I replaced it last week with a Capresso Infinity, and it has made a world of difference in the quality of the espresso I'm getting from my Saeco Magic Cappucino Plus. I'm not an expert barista by any means, but the finer grind I get from the Capresso is more than worth the extra $35. I might also add that it's much quieter than the Cuisinart, which is loud enought to wake the dead."
5,Cuisinart Automatic Burr Mill never dies,I have the Cuisinart Automatic Burr Mill I don't think the model is the same but it looks just like this one. I have had it now 6 years and it is going strong never a problem. I do after a few refills of beans turn it upside down and tap the sides to any little bits of coffee grind and any little bits of coffee beans out. I am very happy with this it has grinded alot of coffee beans.
1,Piece of junk,"I purchased one of these mills at Fry's, and it died after only a couple of uses. The motor just quit. Cuisinart must be having quality problems with their motors, because I had purchased a ""Grind Central"" model to replace one I had worn out, and the motor also died right away. I will try another brand (fool me twice, shame on me...)"
3,It was great for 113 days...,"I bought this burr-grinder from Cuisinart. It was refurbished, but the price was excellent. I used it to grind my espresso beans for my Cuisinart Espresso Machine. A match made in heaven! A more consistent grind than the machine at Starbucks! Then it quit working 2 days ago (Saturday). I called Cuisinart this morning. Because it was refurbished, it only had a 90 day warranty. Had it quit 2 weeks sooner they would've replaced it. Because it lasted 113 days, I'm SOL!"
1,Dead in 8 months,"Horrible!! The unit died after 8 months. The coffee does not grind evenly, and if you need a fine grind like espresso, this is not a good unit. Looks nice on the counter, but truly is of poor quality. Not a good unit if you want something that will last and will give you a good grind."
4,Works Good,"Burr grinder works good and and price is right. It hold 1/2 pound of coffee beans and makes it easy to make a fresh grind as you brew. It's somewhat noisy, but that's expected."
1,You get what you pay for,This is cheap. And I tried it twice. I actually bought it twice and it broke on me both times. Do no recommend it. Worth paying more for something that will last.
3,"OK, but not great quality","We have had one of these for several years now, but will be replacing it with a different brand as this one has had several problems over time.The ongoing problem is that it tends to require periodic disassembly and cleaning, particularly where the outlet into the bin gets plugged with fine coffee.At one point fairly shortly after we got it, the interlock switch that prevents it from running without the bin in place failed. I took it apart and bypassed the switch which allowed us to continue to use it, but really isn't the best way to do things (it makes a mess if started without the bin in place :-)."
3,Not what it's cracked up to be.,"Although it is a burr grinder, you get just as much powder with the grind as with the blade type. The reason that i purchased the burr type of grinder is that i make french press coffee which needs a larger, more consistent grind, and this machine just doesn't do it."
1,"unreliable, decrease in quality","The first of this burr mill lasted quite a while, so when it broke down I decided to purchase one of the same-- what a mistake. It arrived broken where it never turned on so I had to repackage it and send it back (although Amazon was really good thru the whole process.) The second one that arrived worked for 30 days and then went KA-PUT! So now I am stuck with it. Maybe there was a decrease in quality of the mill parts since the first one I purchased. Caveat-emptor!"
5,I Use This In My 4-Cup drip,"I Love It. Why?1) Got it cheap, $182) Burr tastes better, even in drip maker3) Premeasures for my 4 cup, so I just hit the button. So much faster than using my whirly grinder than I make coffee most every morning now instead of buying out.4) Coffee dust not a big deal for me. I tap the ""catcher"" on my counter once or twice while tilted, then pour coffee right into my filter. Fast prep, yeah!5) For cleanup, catcher goes into dishwasher weekly and I use a dry paper towel to polish out the dust between washes.6) I have dark countertops, but w my methods, no dusty mess.7) Has easily PAID FOR ITSELF since home coffee so much faster/easier.8) Motor still beefy after 2 mos.I don't french press often (cholesterol) so no issues there."
3,"Love this Grinder---but, I've Killed two of them now","I really like this grinder...I used it to make drip coffee from my local bean roaster. I grind exactly what I need each day on a level 5 setting and the coffee is substantially better than getting my beans pre-ground.However, I have killed two of these in two years. Cuisinart replaced the first one no questions asked. The second one just died and I think it's time to move on. I'm looking to get a heartier burr mill this time around."
5,Cuisinart Automatic Coffee Grinder,"This is a truly great machine. I have used it for years, and just gave one to a friend who is just thrilled with it,because it so convenient . You just turn on the machine, walk away ,and it just grinds the desired amount at the perfect grind, and stops all by itself."
2,Time to be replaced,Just got off the phone with Cuisinart customer service. They said my warr. expired March 2010 and it was time to replace my grinder. The motor died this morning after about 2 years of light use.
3,Don't Order From Canada,"The grinder is a little noisy but works OK. Our issue with this transaction is that the vendor uses UPS to ship to Canada. They quoted $28 to ship a $38 bean grinder, I could live with that, as in Canada the grinder sold for about $80. But it didn't quite work out that way; first off, UPS couldn't find our house (in an older Ottawa neighbourhood) and then had the gall to charge us a $22 ""brokerage"" fee. So, in the end, UPS charged us $50 to ship a small, $38 grinder. If you do buy anything from Amazon.com, ensure the vendor uses United States Postal Service, they don't charge ""brokerage"" like greedy ol' UPS."
3,Good but needed more testing,"This is a quality burr grinder that does a very good job for the money. The only problem with it is the grind hopper does not stay in place while you are grinding the beans. You can't set it, walk away, and come back to a hopper full of grinds. You literally have to stand there and push and hold the hopper in place so that the safty cut-off sensor, doesn't interrupt the grinding process. This is extremely inconvenient for when you are grinding a full hopper of beeans."
1,Complete Junk,"Bought this at a store. Used it maybe 20-30 times over about 4 months and it died. The plastic bean chamber that threads into the drive using a plastic shaft cracked, I guess from changing the grind size.Fortunately, a replacement ordered at Cuisinart.com only cost 8 dollars. Unfortunately, a month after ordering it and receiving two shipping dates, I just received an email telling me that ""due to high demand, the product is out of stock"" and they hope to ship in 30 days. A replacement part that is out of stock due to high demand is not a good thing. I cancelled my order and bought the Capresso model thru Amazon..hopefully it is better. At least they didn't charge my credit card.Oh, by the way, the unit didn't even work that good...the consistency of the grind was no different than my ten buck blade grinder."
2,not worth it,"we are coffee freaks...meaning we love to have really good quality coffee all the time. when we're not spending too much money at coffee shops for great microfoam lattes, we're trying to make a good cup of french press with our burr grinder. we had this thing for 3 months and could never get in to it. honestly, it was worse than our hand blade grinder. i would not recommend this product; it is messy beyond belief - meaning crazy static mess all over my counter... we returned it for the bodum burr grinder. great design, but honestly, don't waste your money."
4,We're Happy With This Grinder,"I had reservations about ordering the Cuisinart grinder after reading the mixed reviews here. But, Consumer Reports gave it a good review. So, I decided to give it a try. I'm sure it isn't as good as a $500 grinder. But, moving up from a simple blade grinder. We're very happy with it. It is noisy, but not more noisy than our old blade grinder. I do wish it ground a little finer. But, ground coffee works fine for espresso and cappuccinos if packed into the filter basket of our basic Krupps espresso maker.As some have suggested, grounds do stick to the plastic bin. But, it's not a big problem for us. This grinder has markings to control how many cups of coffee for which you want to grind. We make our coffee pretty strong but find that it grinds too much. So, when we make 10 cups of coffee, we set the grinder to 8 cups.It's too soon to speak to durability. But, we're enjoying the Cuisinart grinder very much."
2,LOUD!!!!,"My old cheap coffee grinder broke and I was about to buy a new one when I found this in my house. I still has not figured out how this brand new coffee grinder got here but I've been using it and I can't stand the noise (I need to buy a new one and I'll do it right now, on Amazon). Well, this thing is LOUD. I have to block my ears when it grinds coffee and I do not allow my child to be near, it'll really ruin your hearing. It looks good but the loud noise is not worth it. Save your ears, people."
2,Only lasted 6 months,I bought this (along with a French Press)as a gift for my husband and it worked great for about 6 months. Now it only works occasionally and more often than not it either doesn't work at all or we can hear the motor but it doesn't grind the beans. We are very disappointed and I'm sending it back to Cuisinart.
1,Short life,I have had 2 of these and both have died in less than a year. They work great but not worth buying for such a short life span.
1,This thing is Junk!,"My wife bought me this for my birthday a year ago and after 2 months the switch stopped working. It won't stick so you have to stand there and hold the switch down to grind your coffee. Recently the opposite happened and now the switch is stuck in the ""on"" position so you have to operate the unit by plugging and unplugging. Just today, the motor gave out. All this within a year and I don't even use the thing that much. Looks nice and I like the design, but it's total junk. Do yourself a favor and buy something from another manufacturer. That's what I'll be doing today."
5,Great Product,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he's been using it regularly since. No problems, easy to use, easy to clean. We're completely satisfied with it."
5,Nice upgrade from a blade grinder.,"I bought some coffee in Chiapas, Mexico. I put some beans on my blade grinder, pressed the button for a little while, made some coffee using a french press and voilá... well, not voilá. The coffee tasted so bad. It was burnt. I googled on how to grind coffee beans and find out that the blade grinder is not that good; cheap, but not good.Then I decided to upgrade my grinder to this model. I put the same beans, I selected the coarse setting and voilá. The smell of this ground coffee was so different from the other one, it was not burnt. The coffee was excellent, I could appreciate all the flavors and body."
2,cannot grind fine,this is a good burr grinder if you do not plan to grind for espresso. it is unable to grind beans fine enough for my breville espresso maker. i will be returning it for that very reason as i do not like products that cannot do what they say they can do.
3,Cuisinart DBM-8 Supreme Grind Automatic Burr Mill,We purchased this burr mill three years ago in February and it just gave out. We had to take the beans out and finish them in our tiny Krups coffee grinder which still works just fine after 25 years. We sure expected Cuisinart to last longer! It did a good job of grinding beans to the fineness we liked and we enjoyed being able to grind just before brewing but it was sad to pitch such a relatively new appliance.
2,Great Grinder that does not last over 2 years,This is the third unit I have had. The first one worked for a little over 2 years then it quit. The second one arrived DOA. The third is operating and makes an excellent grind. Amazons price was better than anywhere else and when the second one arrived DOA they were quick to replace the defective unit.
2,Good for Drip or French Press NOT FOR Expresso,"The grinder works well but does not grind fine enough for expresso. The grinder's quantity setting and bean hopper work well. The unit is easy to use. The lid on the coffee grind collector is covered by coffee grinds during grinding and they typically fall off (onto the counter) when removing the lid. Ok overall, but not great."
2,"Could have been great, but...","I have had this grinder for a little over a year now. I love the design of the unit. It still grinds the beans great but, about two months after I started using it, it does not grind the right amount of beans anymore. It grinds more than it is set for, which is very frustrating. So the cup setting is worthless. Beware if you have a problem with the grinder, keep your receipt. When you call Cuisinart, they run the serial number to see when the unit was made. So they go off of that for your date of purchase. The problem is, if it set in a store or warehouse for a long time, your screwed if you can't supply a receipt to prove when you actually purchased it. Also, you have to pay for shipping to Cuisinart and inclose a check for $4.00 for return shipping. If it wasn't for the problem with grinding the wrong amount of cups, I would recommend this product."
1,Not Very Durable,"We had this grinder for about 9 months and seemed relative satisfied with the results of the grind. However, without warning the threaded section at the bottom of the hopper that feeds the beans into the grinder just broke off into pieces in mid grind. Chewed up the cheap plastic in the hopper feeder into the coffee grinds and is now unusable. We brew 1 pot of coffee a day like most people and I expect a product like this to last for more than just a few months. Not very durable, not recommended."
3,Decent burr grinder,"I have had this grinder for over a year, using it daily, and it has held up alright. It rarely gets clogged, and it has been durable. The grind is inconsistent, even in the same batch of grinding, which complicates espresso making. However, it is a reasonably priced burr grinder (which is always going to be better than a non-burr type) and it's still running."
1,Ditto ... bad deal,"Ditto... Bad Deal...plastic neck inside grinder broke after 3 months. I didn't find the grind any better than a simple blade grinder. Noizy, messy and large on the counter."
2,Short life,"I have bought two of these grinders. They have worked fine, but both have had short lives. My next purchase will be a different brand as I desire a product that lasts."
4,"Great product, and you can get it for less",I use this to grind coffee for my Kuerig B70. It works quite well. And you can get it for much less at Costco.
3,Good while it lasted,I found this burr grinder very easy to use and was happy with it while it lasted. Unfortunately it died after 9 months.We used it about twice a week. It lasted about as long as the Bodum in the same price range.
1,an engineering joke,"It is noisy, messy, bulky, and it does not give consistent grind. It does not work at all for espresso, way too coarse even at the finest setting. It also clogs up all the time."
2,Low Quality grinder,"Sad to say but it looks like Cuisinart have dropped the ball with this product. I bought this grinder at Costco several years back because of the brand name and the reasonable price... what a mistake. Along with all the relevant annoyances the rest of the reviewers are describing (lousy grinding; loud; coffee getting stuck in the safety micro-switches... to name a few) , this grinder started to fail only a year after my purchase. First the timer slider stopped working, then the circuit board gave up in its second year... how hard is to manufacture a reliable product that simple....?? It's not a rocket science after all.."
3,Lots of dust,"I expected that on the coarse grind there would not be coffee dust. Boy, was I wrong. Even grinding on coarse and sifting through a sifter, there is lots of dust. You can see it on the front of the receptical, in a mound on the front. But unfortunately it isn't all there, or you could just wipe it away. For the price I didn't expect perfectly ground coffee. I am extremely disappointed that there's that much dust, though, on the coarse to medium grind. As a result, even if I make the coffee in the French Press, I pour my husband's into a cup but mine through a filter because I cannot abide mud in the bottom of the cup.The noise level doesn't seem that loud for a grinder, so it doesn't bother us. Like that it stops automatically. The amount settings seem to have little to no relationship to the actual amount of coffee you'll need, so I wouldn't count on that too much."
2,Disintiegrated a few months after warranty,"I loved this grinder until yesterday, when the grinder mechanism disintegrated. Blew all the screws and ground them up with the coffee! Of course, it's just out of warranty, (18 months) so I have no recourse but to buy another one. Obviously, I won't be replacing the new one with the same brand. I'm bummed, because Cuisinart products have been pretty reliable for me in the past. I really think they should at least try to make products that last a good while beyond the length of the warranty they offer."
3,Cuisinart DBM-8 Supreme Grind Automatic Burr Mill,"This is the second one I have purchased, I got it because of the fine setting to grind whole bean coffee (most of the coffee grinders do not have this feature)...I like my coffee in an almost powder form as I think it adds to the flavor. Only problem with this machine is is it is made in China and once you have a problem with it and the warranty is out of date you have to throw it away as Cuisinart DOES NOT repair or have any place that will...I got 5 years use out of my first one and not on a daily basis either. It should have a throw-away price tag attached."
3,"Fine Machine, but no go for espresso","I purchased this hoping it would be a less expensive option for my espresso machine, but no go. The grinder does not have enough variation at the fine grinding levels for espresso. Would probably be fine as a coffee grinder, but I had to return it for a more expensive model."
2,dusty and messy,"I'm in search of the perfect grinder, of course. As a decades-old coffee drinker, I've tried several. I was reasonably impressed with Starbucks' Barista-brand burr grinder. It got all the grind settings right, even for espresso, but after each use a small pile of grounds wound up on the counter. So I tried this Cuisinart, since I have the company's coffee maker and the price was right. However, I have a couple of complaints: (1) the ground coffee must pass through a very narrow chute into the container, so the chute clogs easily; and (2) there was so much static friction from the grinding process (or whatever) that excessive ground coffee would attach to the container's sides. After each use, I had to spend several minutes cleaning up.Now, onto the Kitchen Aid."
2,Warning: Replace Yearly,"While this grinder works well at first, beware! Our second one just died after a little over a year. The previous one had a similar lifespan. It was not used for industrial/business purposes, parties, or anything excessive--my husband just used it to grind beans for his morning espresso, which was necessary about every other day. I knew it was every other day because the thing is so loud I could hear it in the bedroom on the other side of the house! Grinder number 3 will definitely be a different brand."
2,Disappointment eased,"After fewer than six months of daily use, this grinder began to grind less and less coffee for each setting of the timer. It now requires four cycles of the 12-cup position to grind enough beans for an 8-cup carafe. One reviewer has suggested rigorous cleaning, but even that is of no avail. It goes for replacement (along with my $4) tomorrow, but I expect the same results. Instead,the writer who recommends a simple untimed blade grinder may be on the right track.This unit was replaced under warranty by the factory at minimal return shipping cost. The replacement has been in daily use for several months and appears to be entirely satisfactory. Perhaps the key to my current pleasure is daily cleaning of the ""exit window"" which feeds the ground coffee into the collector. Build-up there can accumulate thick and fast and interfere with operation."
1,Disintegration,"Owned this grinder about 1 year. Worked fine in general. It is important to remove the hopper and clean the grind surfaces and, more importantly make sure the opening into the grind container is cleared from time to time. It clogs much more readily with the oil coated beans. Dry beans, such as starbucks, are much less likely to stick in the opening. The reason my 1 star is that the threads on the hopper disintegrated after a while and the hopper would no longer screw into the base. The threads are made of plastic and are a bit delicate. Would have made more sense if they were steel, as this part of the hopper is an integral part of the grind chamber. Well it is the trash hep for this one."
1,But at least it looks nice...,"I bought this grinder because for one it matched my coffee maker, and another, it was a burr grinder. I have had it for 6 weeks and this morning I press the button, and nothing. It does not work. I would not recommend this to anyone. There is a warranty, but now I wonder, how long will it be before I get my grinder back? And after shipping and the $4 for them to ship it back, will it really be worth it?"
2,no better than a whirly blade for a uniform grind,"I have used this product for a couple years. I have always been disappointed with the extra fine grind (dust) that comes through, but just figured that you couldn't do better. I don't know if it is the plastic burrs or what, but the fact of the matter is that you do not get a uniform grind. Recently I had used one of the 80$ Capresso burr grinders and was amazed by the uniformity of the grind, none of the dust was present (they have steel burrs).So what I'm saying is that if you just want to grind coffee, there is no need to buy this, just use a 15$ whirly blade grinder. If you want a uniform grind, don't look here, save up 40$ more and buy a Capresso.2 stars because the output is smaller than the input beans."
1,The worst coffee grinder ever,"At less than six months old, the automatic function ceased; next time it stopped and began to smoke. Then I could not locate the receipt to return it where I purchased it (Costco) so it will probably get dumped. Will buy another brand. Yes, I had read earlier reviews of the Cuinsinart appliance and I should have heeded the warnings."
1,Good for Coffee - BAD for Espresso,"I have been grinding coffee beans for years and have not found a perfect grinder - not looking for one. This grinder is a nice looking piece that will complement any countertop - brushed chrome, stylish hopper, clicky adjustments. It will grind coffee just fine, but does a HORRIBLE job grinding fine for espresso. On the finest setting, I have to run the grounds through 4 times and use a wooden spoon to shove them through. The only reason it is not in the trash is I am waiting for Cuisinart to reply to my inquiries regarding adjustments. It is my hope that my grinder has bad factory settings or maybe I can open it up and adjust it myself. I do not recommend this grinder for anyone intending to grind espresso."
3,Looks great and is better than a blade grinder but........,"I bought one of these Cuisinart burr grinders and I must admit it is very nice looking on the counter and it does do a better job than a blade grinder but..... it doesn't make a really even grind. What I mean is it makes a lot of finely powdered grounds along with the rest. It's also very loud.If you live in an apartment, have close neighbors or your any light sleepers in the house you might want to consider another burr grinder. But as I said it is a really nice looking appliance and it IS better than a blade grinder."
1,Loved it till it died after 3 months... twice.,"I loved the look and function of this grinder... until the motor died, after just 3 months of use. My brand new replacement also died after 3 months of use. I couldn't get through to Cuisinart's customer service, either - I had to leave a message and wait for them to call me back, which hasn't happened yet. I will NOT be buying Cuisinart in the future."
1,No better than a blade grinder.,"I bought this for home use on the weekends. No Good. This grinder is an unbelievably high speed and noisy mill that turns a good 10 percent of the beans into fine powder. The high-speed burrs overheat the beans and produce a terrible cup of coffee. It sounds like a jet engine about to blow. My cheap GE blade grinder from Wal-Mart does a better job and is quieter. Perhaps the Kitchen Aid Pro-Line mill that I use every day at work has spoiled me. If you want to use a burr grinder to elevate the quality of your coffee, don't buy this one."
2,Ok... while it works,Worked great for 3 months... then it died. Out of Amaazon return dates... means it needs to go back to Cuisinart which is proving a pain and will probably cost me more than it is worth. Don't skimp on this stuff... it is a bad morning when your coffee aparatus bites it....
3,Died after 3 years,"Didn't use it every day, just every few weeks to make a canister of ground coffee. Saw it coming as it would stop working and have to ""catch its breath"" for a day and then would run again for a while. As others have said, it's as loud as a 747 in your kitchen. If I wasn't buying fair trade coffee beans in bulk, this wouldn't have been worth it at all."
2,"Way too noisy, static electricity buildup","This grinder is really noisy. It may grind the coffee a bit better than the blender-type units, but it is not worth the deafening racket it puts out. The ground coffee is also electrostatically charged, which makes it hard to pour into the coffeepot basket."
2,Fine in you like to buy replacements.,My wife's favorite grinder and It does an excellent job but it doesn't last. We have gone through three of them and have moved on.
1,Not consistent in measuring coffee,The timer on this product is very inaccurate. It is supposed to allow you to set the grind cycle for the number of cups you want and then grind the proper amount of beans. The timer varies greatly: Sometimes too much (too strong); sometimes too little (too weak). The lowest setting is four cups although it appears their idea of a cup is about half a cup (4 oz). Grinding works OK but they would have done better with a physical measurement (a small cache that holds exactly a standard coffee measure) than a timer.
2,cuisinart dbm-8,this is good grinder for regular coffee but no for expresso the coffee beans don't came fine enough for expreso machine
1,Broken after 3 months,"Worked great for 3 months. Then made a horrible noise, smoke came from within and it would not start. Could not get through to Cuisinart. I tried for 3 days before I gave up. Apparently they hang up after you have been on hold for 20 minutes. To be clear, I only ground coffee once a day. No excessive use, nothing out of the ordinary. Just plain ol' coffee beans from Trader Joe's."
2,"Messy, Grinds OK","This is the first burr grinder we owned. We tend to grind fine. This grinder is far more messy then any previous grinders we've had. Next burr grinder we buy will be with anti-static technology. Didn't know to look for that previously. After about a year the motor burnt out. The grinds get stuck, where they pour out. We've since learned to clean it with a toothpick or sharp object. Consistency is ok. It is a hastle to empty and change coffee beans. But the convenience of not having to fill each day is nice; a trade-off."
2,"Have had 3, all have broken",I loved this grinder while it lasted. All that we have had broke. Two broke within just a few months and the third lasted for 2 years. I will purchase a different brand going forward.
2,Grinds well but....,"This burr grinder does a good job of grinding. However, the timer broke on the fourth day and it's now necessary to hold the button down while grinding. This is a hassle and reduces my appreciation for how well the grinder itself works."
2,Controls very inaccurate,"I bought this as a gift for my husband and at first he loved it. Now however, after a few months of use the controls no longer work reliably. The main problem is with the quantity of coffee you are grinding. No matter what setting it is set at it grinds the same amount of coffee every time. It continues to grind until the whole container is full and that makes the coffee way too strong. I would never purchase this again. We had better luck with our old cheap blade grinder."
2,Avoid it if you can afford to,"I've been searching for a good grinder for home and I know I don't want this one. We've been using this one at work. It's messy and the throat clogs with beans regularly. The burr does not come out to clean, either, so it's difficult to maintain. If you can afford a better one, I would recommend you pass this one over."
3,Just so-so.,Too loud and messy for me. I plan to return it and spend a few more bucks. I guess you get what you pay for.
1,Disapointed,"This burr grinder does not deliver the consistent grind that you should expect. Whenever I did a coarse grind, there was also a fine clumpy powder that would stick to the lid. Which would make a nice coffee slushy but not a proper cup of joe. This grinder was a gift to me, so I thought I would stick with it but after three years the internal mechanism stripped the threads on the plastic hopper making it completely unusable.My advice spend another $40 and get a better made grinder. The cuisinart was bad from beginning to end."
2,Good grinder for house coffee,does not grind fine enough for espresso...must send it back. It matches myCuisinart DCC-2000 Coffee-on-Demand 12-cup Programmable Coffeemakerperfectly though so it is a huuuuuge bummer.
2,"Good to start, doesn't last long","I was so excited to purchase my first burr grinder. When I first got it, I loved it, which is why I gave it 2 stars, otherwise I would have only given one. After about 6 months of light use (I didn't even use it every day, and when I did I only ground enough for 4 cups) it just died on me. It wouldn't do anything. I've had the same issue with other Cuisinart coffee products. If they could make it more durable, it would be a great machine. You can store a lot of beans in the hopper, simply select the number of cups you plan to brew and brew method, and it grinds up the right amount of beans. But, only lasting 6 months makes it not worth the money."
2,No better than a blade grinder,"I bought it a while ago and expected to use it both for my french press and espresso machine. However, it is horrible for this purpose. It generates lots of powder for french press, resulting LOTS of sediment in my coffee. It cannot grind as fine as necessary for espresso either, resulting a very weak espresso cup. That said, it's good for drip coffee machine, pretty convenient and easy to clean, but don't expect it to be an upgrade for a blade grinder."
2,Great While it Lasted,"This grinder has been a joy for the last nine months. I bought it in Oct. 2006. Now in June, 9 months later, it has suddenly stopped working. It gave no hint that its last grind would be the final grind.The grinder I had before lasted over 5 years. I have only used the grinder once every two or three days and very gently. Why did it just stop?Will be very wary of Cuisinart products from here on out. What a shame!"
1,Died after 14 months,Noisy and slow. Jammed occasionally. Top burr attached to weak cylindrical bean chute which disintegrated after about 14 months of daily use.
2,Not for Coffee Snobs,"This Cuisinart Supreme Grind is only slightly better than a blade grinder.The burrs are metal plates with blunt, not sharp, teeth for grinding. I am skeptical that the burrs are even steel. Another downside is that as it grinds a fine powder builds up in the corner of the container while larger grounds fall to the bottom; static is a problem, but ultimately it is easy to keep a tidy counter with this grinder.One positive feature is that one of the burrs is removable and therefore, I can have it modified and sharpened.Conclusion: spend $20-30 less and get a blade grinder or spend $30-40 more and get a good burr grinder."
1,Can hear it a mile away,"I've never heard anything louder in my life. we keep it in a cabinet in the garage- turn it on quickly, close the cabinet , rush in the garage door & close that also & it still wakes everyone up. Its a ear screetching noise that just irritates you enough to make you rather drive to your local coffee shop to buy coffee and some silence."
3,Loud but grinds well,"I have to say, if you wake up earlier than your partner than please grind the night before! The first morning I used this, my girlfriend jumped out of bed because of the noise. Overall Cuisinart made a great product. The burr mill grinds well and helps make a great cup of coffee"
1,FAILx2,"The first one lasted about 9 months into the 18 month warranty. Got a warranty replacement that lasted around 3 months. To be clear, I'm a single guy who drinks maybe 6 cups a day. How much grinding do you think I do? Not a life-long friend."
1,Broke Second Use,"Having used a Krups blade grinder for about 3 years, I was looking forward to the increased volume that this unit seemed to offer. I usually grind 3 lbs of coffee at a time (make enough pods for a month) and the Krups did a good job but was slowwwwwwwww. This unit is apparently only for light daily use. On my second use the motor has apparently burned out. No use sending it back under warranty since the cost of shipping and insurance will be more than I paid for it. I also use French Roast coffee which is very oily and it does tend to gum up the burr grinder. Well, back to the Krups!!"
2,I never knew what good coffee tasted like before,"See Alton Brown's recipe for coffee on the food channel's website. This mill grinder is merely ok, it grinds some of the beans down to a powder, which is not good, it is supposed to grind everything the same when it is a burr grinder. For what this does, I could have gotten a blade grinder for a lot less money."
2,My $10.00 grinder out performs this model,"I spent the extra money for the burr grinder.It's not worth it! The grind is very inconsistent and produces a great deal coffee""dust"" that clings and clumps to the plastic container.I'm going back to the simple blade grinder. Maybe I can use this for spices or herbs."
2,"Loud, inconsistent grind, and breaks easily","I have to agree with most people that this is not a great grinder. I received this as a gift and I liked the idea that I could adjust the grind settings for different uses. I have to say that the grind from the machine is fairly inconsistent and my expensive espresso machine does not work well with the grounds from this grinder.The machine is incredibly noisy. I get a lot of comments on the noise it produces when guests are over. I also thought all grinders were this noisy until my brother used his new grinder recently and it produced 1/10 the noise as this one.Lastly, I've had the grinder over 1 year and the plastic chute connected under the hopper just recently split entirely from the hopper - so this needs to be replaced. The part is only $8, but with shipping it will be $15 and already half the cost of the entire machine. I may be looking for a total replacement."
2,Huh? WHAT? I Can't hear you over the coffee grinder!!,"Very. very. loud. and it grinds and grinds and grinds for a very long time and we could never figure out where all that ground coffee ended up because it wasn't in the receptacle. We would set it for 16 cups, let it grind for 5 minutes while the cats would run and hide from all the noise and then brew 4 cups of weak coffee with what we got out. It did look nice, I can say that about it."
4,second purchase,"This is the second one, the first one melted inside,it worked well for about 4 years. I hope this one will do a better job."
1,LOADED WITH BPA,"If you are someone who tries to avoid plastics containing BPA, don't waste your time ordering this machine. All plastics that come in contact with the beans and ground beans are number 7 plastic. Terribly disapointed in Cuisinart. Sending this back."
4,Good value for an above-average grind,"I purchased this coffee grinder because I wanted an even, adjustable grind. Despite some of the negatives (detailed below), I would make this purchase again.+ Functionality: It contributes to a great pot of coffee.+ Adjustable: You can control the size and amount of the grind very easily.+ Aesthetic: It looks good on the counter.- Finer grinds tend to clump at the edges of the container.- Static electricity makes it difficult to get all of the grind out.Overall, I'm quite satisfied with this purchase."
2,Espresso Grind? Fawgetaboutit!!!,"If you are in market for a coffee grinder for espresso and thinking about the Cuisinart, fawgetaboutit! It doesn't do the job. I have a Cuisinart coffee maker and also a Cuisinart espresso machine and thought I would round out the set with the coffee grinder. I was planning to give away my $20 Krupps grinder I bought twelve years ago but have to keep it to grind espresso. At its finest grind, the Cuisinart doesn't even come close to the grind I'm used to for espresso. As a medium to very course grinder, I have no complaints. If I thought I got a defective product, I would just return it (I still might) but I really think that this is as good as it gets for fine grind."
1,Does not last!! :(,"The bottom line: This worked quite well for approximately 2 months. It started to make some funny noises, and this morning it stopped and emitted a mild burning rubber smell. Called Cuisinart customer service and the very helpful person said they would ship me a new one if I pd $10 to have them ship it to me, and then I would have to pay to ship the broken one back. Not sure if having another one of these unreliable machines is worth shelling out another $15 or so....I almost NEVER write negative reviews...I am a very easy to please person...but this was quite disappointing. For those of you who have had yours for awhile without problem, I am very happy for you. For those of you considering buying this, you might want to look around a little more."
5,Getting the most out of the coffee bean,"Like you do, to get the aroma and taste out of herbs and spices, the same applies to getting more flavor out of your coffee. With this grinder, one can grind the fineness or coarseness for the brewing process and the amount for the number of cups. I have two cups per morning, so I have a fresh grind for two cups and get the best flavor out of my beans and no stale coffee taste.I would like the grinder motor to run at a slower turn to mimic the real old coffee grinders. The burr mill style performs better than the chopper blades that are offered, but a slower motor speed would improve the grind."
1,Biggest POS - stay way away ....,"I have had two of these second one was a free replacement because the first one DIED after a couple of months. This is hands down the WORST grinder I have ever owned - I would rather grind the beans between my teeth first.Problems: You need ear protectors on before grinding, LOUD, huh, about as loud as the Space Shuttle taking off from five feet. Grinds are sooooooooooooooo inconsistent. Doesn't grind like the selection indicates. Static cling doesn't even describe it, I have to keep a small brush beside the grinder in order to get all the stuck grinds out of the hopper. Continuously clogs up need to clean it out every other day. Total and utter junk I wouldn't take another one if it was free...!!!"
1,Failed After 30 Months,This relatively expensive Quisinart product had a short life; replaced it with a KitchenAid grinder at half the price.
2,Made in CHINA,"Unit works OK, but is very loud and difficult to clean. Grounds jam exit port and cause heat. Output hopper is plagued by static electricity which causes grounds to cling inside. Internal mill screws will keep falling out and jam mill or end up in your coffee (you can really hear the screws when they fall into the milling section -- turn it off when this happens). Unit will wear completely out within the first year. Overall, if you like cheap Chinese imports, not bad for the money."
1,Cuisineart Coffee Mill Review,"The coffee mill itself works well..however, the 12 cup clear plastic resevoir which is not physically attached to the grinder but only rests on a recessed seat atop the unit often gets dislodged through bumping contact and spills the beans all over the counter and floor.This happens frequently and is a real pain. Next time,out it goes!"
1,Horrendous quality,"I have had 3 of these machines. The first lasted a few months and stopped working suddenly. I replaced with a new unit and it died within a month of its first use. Because it does a reasonable job for a good price and thinking that I may have had a dud unit, I recently bought a third machine at Costco and figured I would give it another try. The unit died within 2 weeks. The unit was used once a week to grind enough coffee for about 14 cups, so it was used very lightly. I cannot understand how Cuisinart which makes some good products can continue selling these POS.Do not waste your money"
1,Total Waste,"After 2 non-fatal strokes, it is dead. Thank you, for ending my misery. Add to that, my Cuisinart Coffee maker died recently. We weren't meant to be a family. Where's the hammer?"
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"We got this as a wedding gift, not on my list. My husband just threw it in the garbage after three years, literally in the garbage. The thing was poorly designed, very messy, it should come with a skewer to clean out the grinder part, instead you get a little brush that doesn't even reach!!!! The container that holds the ground coffee is square making an even bigger mess when you dump it into the coffee filter! And because the container that holds the beans is poorly designed we had to shake the grinder to get the beans down into the grinder portion. Don't buy!!!!!!!"
4,Cuisinart DBM-8 Supreme Coffee Grinder,Great grinder for the daily coffee drinker. Its not a $500 grinder and your not gonna make expresso but it does a great job. The settings are easy to use and vary from fine to coarse. The top has a setting for how many cups you want to grind and seem to be accurate. The grinder provides a taste of fresh coffee that you wont get from coffee in a bag. The grinder doesnt get to hot and wont burn your beans. Its not messy and well worth the money.
4,"so far, so good","I bought this so I could grind coffee for a French press and so far I am happy with the grind. I usually grind once a week, so I do not use it every day. The hopper holds about 10 cups of coffee beans, depending on the grind. It works as advertised, its easy to use and easy to clean.For what I paid ($36) it seams to have an equal value."
5,cuisinart coffee grinder,"Excellent coffee grinder. set and forget your grind setting. consistent coffee with cup number selection (2 cup increments). bought this one for Christmas gift, have had my own for 4+ years without a problem and we grind 6-8 cups per day."
4,Great price,"This is the best price I've seen for this product. Works well, a little noisy but it won't burn your coffee like other grinder types can thus better tasting coffee and consistent taste too. Still trying to figure out the best way to deal with the static build up in the plastic bin. Does make for a little more mess then the cup type grinder."
3,Cuisinart Coffee Mill,"So far, so good. The model I have now is a replacement for one that malfunctioned. So, I'm keeping my fingers crossed."
1,Defective Product - Do Not Buy,"Our grinder lasted less than 3 months. It maybe ground 80 pots of coffee before it burned out. We bought our's from Kohls, but people need to be warned not to buy this because it is junk. Great design, great looks, but it will not last and is a waste of money."
4,works good,for the price it is deff worth it.i just replaced one just like it. it lasted 5 years and i used it every day. it does leave some powder on top and is not a 100% consistent grind. if you don't want to spend 100's this is the best one you can get.
1,Poor quality,"Good quality, Multi purpose use.Quick blending process. Happy with the product. Little bit loud noise.Product was delivered very quickly. Broke down in 3 months."
2,"efficient, loud, broken","I have owned different brands, Krups, Braun, Cappresso, Cuisinart, and Mr Coffee burr grinders. The Cuisinart did a good job of grinding, and was no more or less messy/hard to clean than others. But, it was the loudest and then broke at about 6 months. It's back to the Braun KMM 30 for us."
2,Husband loved it until it died after only 8 months,"My husband was thrilled to receive this burr mill for Father's Day '05. I thought I was buying a quality piece of equipment, it looks good and I knew he would love being able to store his beans in the hopper. But it just died in January '06. I've emailed Cuisinart about it being replaced, I'll give an update when something transpires."
2,Buy A Different Grinder,"I have owned a Cuisinart DBM-8 burr grinder for 1 year. My main complaint is that it always grinds at least one TBS of very fine powder, no matter the grind setting, which makes coffee overly bitter. I've had to sift the powder out of the ground coffee each morning. This can be annoying if you've bought the grinder to make french press coffee which requires a consistently coarse grind. This burr grinder stopped working after only 1 year of use. If you've got the money, invest in something better than this grinder. For $50, the Cuisinart DBM-8 should last more than 1 year and offer a more consistent grind."
2,Better than a hammer?,"Regardless of the setting you use, you will get half coffee powder and half coarse grounds. In addition, the feature that is intended to allow you to control the amount of grounds you make with a switch on the top ... does not work. Be prepared to grind more than you need, and then measure the grounds (somehow avoiding the powder) yourself."
1,Extremely Noisy. 106db!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This grinder seems to work fine. However after owning it just 2 weeks, I can't take it anymore! We are buying another grinder. It is the loudest applicance I have ever heard. It sounds like an air raid siren! I took out my Radio Shack sound meter and measured the sound level at 106db at a half a meter! It wakes the whole house which is just terrible."
1,One star is generous . . .,"I gave it 1 star only because 0 stars is not an option.Just look at the percentage of 1-star reviews -- MOST of the reviews are 1-star!! -- and let that be your indicator of whether you should waste your money on this horrible piece of . . . Cuisinart.It's not a question of **if** it will break but **when**. I realize there tends to be a lot of hyperbole in some of these ratings websites such as this, but my Cuisinart burr grinder worked ***ONE*** time. Once. As in 'two minus one' times. Solamente una.Fifty bucks to grind 6 oz of coffee is no bargain by anyone's measure.Do not think you are getting a bargain here. All you are getting is an expensive chunk of landfill.Simply put -- do not buy this awful, awful little machine."
3,Motor can burn out prematurely,Hopper can get clogged with coffee grounds and should be redesigned. Grinds well when workning but needs a more owerful motor with longer life.
1,a waste of money and time,This quit working after only a few months use could not recommend anyone buy this item. Spent a full day cleaning and trying to get it restarted to no avail.
3,Worked fine but will trade up with replacement,"I've had this grinder for a little over a year and it just died this morning. It's been fine for grinding the beans for my husband's morning coffee (he loves the fresh ground) but I won't replace it with the same. One thing that irked me was how much coffee stayed in the grinding bin after the grind. Total static electricity going on there and fine grounds would fly around when ever I'd take the lid off. Oh well, knew its limitations when I bought it, thanks to these reviews. However it's served its purpose and it's time to move on to a better one."
2,Cuisinart DBM-8 Grinder,"I purchased this grinder in June 2011 for use with a french press. I was satisfied with the grind produced using the coarsest setting, although as other reviewers have noted, the grinder does produce some dust. The unit burned out after 13 months. I may perform an autopsy to see what failed, but am sure it is not fixable as it put out a considerable amount of (nasty) smoke when going through it's death throes."
1,This grinder is fatally flawed,"I bought this grinder a little over a year and a half ago, and right as the warranty was expiring it started to fail. It started with a weak grind and eventually burned out completely. I used it about 4 times a week for about 10 seconds each time. That's right, less than a minute per week and it burned out. If this were a $15 cheapy model no big deal, but I bought a model that is not supposed to be junk. Customer service cordially let me know about the 18 month warranty limit and indicated that in any case I would have to ship it, and send $7 dollars as well for them to return it. It was a moot point because I am out of warranty, but I think what is clear is that Cuisinart is making products that are poorly engineered. Very convenient for them!"
2,Didn't last,have had this one for less than a year. it is giving up the ghost. the hole where the coffee shoots into the little holding tank constantly gets gummed up and needs to be cleaned. now the coffee won't feed properly into the grinder. it seems a simple device to have so many chalenges. I want to press the button and have it do it's thing. this one requires more maintenance than I would have hoped.
2,Worked fine until I did large grind,This unit worked fine for about 2 yrs for small grind amounts. When I set the grind amount to maximum the motor burned out.
2,Stopped working after just two weeks,Xmas gift. Used every other day for two weeks and then went to use and nothing unit was dead. Will try one more.
3,Works well but messy,"I got this for my husband for Christmas. It works well, but he says it is messy and can be frustrating at times."
2,Not impressed.,"We were pretty excited to get this grinder, as we liked the features it offered. However, it has been a headache for us. It takes up a lot of counter space, and we almost always end up with an enormous amount of coffee dust on the counter when we transfer the coffee from the reservoir to our coffee maker. The lid tends to gather fine dust in its corners, and that's what tends to fly everywhere, despite our best efforts to contain it. Granted, it's a minor annoyance, but a constant one.Now, for some reason, the beans don't feed down into the grinder without several good shakes while it whirs benignly, even though the bean hopper is full. I've come to the conclusion that Cuisinart should stick to what it does best: food processors. All other Cuisinart products we've had have been pretty disappointing."
1,"Failed quickly, after a few months","While an OK grinder, it simply stopped working after about 2 or 3 months.Not as fine grind as I would have expected. Definately not a fine Turkish Coffeegrind."
5,I love this grinder!,"Looks like most in the reviews either love it or hate it. For me, I love it. It's the perfect size for my counter and the coffee tastes perfect! I use filtered water so perhaps that could be the problem with those who complain about the taste. One negative thing I have to say about this machine is that the container that captures the ground coffee is plastic so you get a lot of static and you are cleaning up coffee grinds each time you use it. Also, the motor stops based on the ""cups of coffee for brewing"" that you select so you will have to restart it a few times if you are brewing more than a pot full at a time. Small potatoes compared to having wonderful fresh ground coffee. Love it!! Would recommend for the amateur coffee lover :-)"
2,Not such an Excellent grinder anymore.,"I love this product! It is the perfect to have very fresh coffee. I like the adjustable grind and the air tight tray to store the ""left over"" grind. I can't believe I lived so long without one! That was before. Today, it doesn't work at all. When it worked it was great. Now, I have no grinder. So sad. It worked with occasional use for about a year."
2,Buy a Capresso,"This stopped working for me after a few months. And while it was working, I was unimpressed. My roommate had a capresso burr grinder, and when he moved out, I thought i'd save some money and buy the cuisinart. Waste of money. First of all, it just doesn't grind quite as finely as I would like for espresso. Second, it is a freaking mess and really hard to use without getting grinds all over the place. Third, the grounds are not all of a consistent size.All in all, I ended up buying a capresso after all and I am pleased."
2,Should have listened,"I purchased the Cuisinart DBM-8 after reading mostly positive reviews, thinking the negative reviews were just whiners. Extremely loud and irritating (no longer is coffee the best part of waking up). Plastic cup to catch the grounds charges with static electricity and grounds are uncontainable."
2,"Stylish, but short life and poor performance","It's an attractive grinder, holds plenty of coffee and it worked great for about 6 months. After that, I started having problems. The first problem is that the grinder got backed up with coffee. That's not a big issue - it can be cleaned with a toothpick. The cup, even after a thorough cleaning and drying, would have places where the coffee would stick, building up over a few grinds and never releasing without scraping it out. Scraping the coffee just seemed to make it worse. I gave the whole grinder a thorough cleaning on the outside, and the cup as well. After that, the cup started slipping out when grinding and it has to be held in now while grinding. Now the whole thing has gone out (after 1.5 years) by getting caught, on of all things, a coffee bean. I'm definitely willing to spend $20-50 more to get something that will last."
1,SUBPAR PRODUCT! BROKE TWICE WITHIN FEW MONTHS--DO NOT BUY!,"I usually don't write reviews, but this grinder lasted only NINE months so I want to share this with you! There are some serious reliability issues with this machine. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!UPDATE: I received a replacement product in June and as of today (11/04/12) it is broken AGAIN!!!Do not buy this crappy product, you will save you self some a money and TONS of frustration!"
1,Do not buy this,"We purchased this almost exactly one year ago and it no longer works. The grind quality was inconsistent, the motor overheated after about 2 bins full of grinding and it's just not worth the money. Put your money from this, add some more to it and buy something that will really do the job and last."
2,Motor failure just over 1 year.,"I woke up this morning, desperately needing my morning coffee, and my 1 year old burr grinder was DEAD. ONE YEAR OLD and dead. How sad. How pathetic. To pay a premium price and get a machine that dies just after its warranty is up.Not again."
2,It was a great grinder ....... for the two years of its life,"I loved this coffee grinder for so many reasons - the fact that you could just measure the beans, adjust the grind and the number of cups, push a button and walk away while it worked. And it did work - regularly - about twice a week - for nearly two years. Then, one morning --- I got up, measured out the beans, pushed ""START"" and it made a very slow grinding noise ...... produced no ground coffee ..... and gave up the ghost.So now I'm ordering one of the cheaper, dependable Braun or Krupps grinders, like I've had before - which last about 10 to 15 years before they need to be replaced."
1,Utter Garbage,"I have owned two of these machines in the last two weeks. I read with astonishment that for some consumers, the grinder lasted 2 years!In both instances, our machines burned out after about an hour. We followed the instructions meticulously, but alas...I have owned my last Cuisinart product."
2,Very loud,"I would not recommend this grinder. It is so loud that I leave the room or cover my ears. The chamber is plastic, so the grounds stick. Very messy."
1,WARNING: cannot grind fine enouigh for normal espresso machine!,"The finest grind is still much too coarse for a run of the mill espresso machine, and much coarser, for instance, than what you can get in the super market. DO NOT BUY THIS GRINDER IF YOU INTEND TO MAKE ESPRESSO WITH IT.alsoIT IS DEAFENING."
2,Nice grind - Colossal mess,"Yes, this grinder conveniently stores beans in the hopper, has a huge number of grind settings, and makes great coffee. But even if you get over how loud it is, the plastic grind bin is the worst product design I've ever seen. The plastic gets a static charge which make grounds (I grind ""medium"") cling to it. I defy you to dump the grounds into a coffee pot without making a colossal mess. I've had 5 different people try it (to make sure it wasn't just me) but there are grounds on the counter, the floor, and all over the coffee pot itself. How could this have gotten thru product testing?!"
2,Probably worth $50,"I took this product back the first day I bought it for the simple fact that it did not have a fine enough grind for espresso. It seemed to produce a decent drip or press grind, but would also create a clump of dust in the top corner of the bin (annoying). For the engergy conscience, it also stays warm when plugged in, maybe because of internal circuitry such as a transformer. I bought a Baratza, much more expensive, and was impressed with the quality of the grind. I recommend the Baratza."
2,Short life,Purchased the DBM-8 11 months ago and have made grounds twice a day since then. Machine worked well until the motor quit this morning.Am surprised by the early death of this coffee ginder. Looks like the designers have traded off life for cost.
1,"OK coffee mill, better than a grinder","What it is: burr-style coffee mill, not just a grinder.Coffee mills - especially adjustable burr mills, are noted for their quality and consistency of grind.This mill works okay.There is a slider to select 2, 4, 6, 8, ... cups. (no odd increments.)The mill does produce a consistent grind - though it is adjustable, it consistently produces particles of fine grind as well as whatever coarseness you set it on. So for instance, set to a very coarse grind for use in a french press, a significant amount of fine-grind is produced. This is undesirable.It is an okay grinder, not bad enough return yet at the same time, not worthy of praise either.--after less than a year the safety switch in the base is malfunctioning and sometimes the grinder is UN-useable."
1,Quit Working After 7 Months,"This grinder did a decent enough job for the first few months, then I began having trouble getting it to turn on. I think the slide switch broke. Very Poor quality."
4,Good little grinder,"It's time to replace our ($45) burr grinder...after a year & a-half. We've been very happy with this Cuisinart grinder since we were not expecting it to last this long. It grinds efficiently, but it's kind of loud. Most grinders are loud though, so expect it. This grinder has a WIDE variety of settings for course/fineness of grounds. We used this for our espresso machine a few times, and had no problems. Grounds were plenty fine to allow for adequate brewing. Most of the time, we used it for our drip coffeemaker. The receptacle is made of plastic though, so static and dust is a bit of a problem, and the more you use the brush to sweep the grounds from the receptacle the worse it gets. However, for the price, this might be the best budget grinder available. We will look for a different grinder this time, that has a stainless steel or glass receptacle, but if the price isn't reasonable...we will purchase this one again."
2,Not for Turkish Coffee,I have bought this item two weeks ago. Overall quality is good but even with finest settings coffee grinds are not fine enough to make Turkish Coffee. If you wanna make Turkish coffee definitely this is NOT your machine. I am returning this item and ordered Capresso Inifinity Burr Grinder hope it will work fine.
1,Should be called a bean bouncer,"This is the worst design I have ever seen. In order to work, you need to have the hopper full or your beans just bounce around. Only Cuisinart could come up with a grinder concept like this."
2,Cuisinart burr grinder,I've had this burr grinder for years and like it much better than my previous grinder.Cons:It is difficult to clean. I've spent hours digging old grinds out of the mechanisms. It cannot be taken apart to clean the burr.It is loud.The 'timer' is not accurate for coffee measure.The high speed of the grinder can heat the oils in the beans and leave a burnt or bitter taste.My next grinder will be a high quality (ceramic) manual grinder.
3,good grinder but not reliable,"I have owned two of these grinders -- one for 1 1/2 years and one for 5 weeks -- problem with both was they just stopped working -- went on all the blogs/forums, did all the cleaning stuff and still nothing. I returned to Cuisinart (because Amazon seller would not respond to me); they will replace but my charges for shipping (both ways) are almost $23. I get one shipped to me after paying $7, but it cost me $16 to ship the inoperable unit to them --I think this was a very reasonable grinder (for my home espresso machine), but doesn't seem to be very reliable."
1,"Use a hammer, it's more consistent!","VERY INCONSISTENT GRIND and the unit clogged up and began to smoke... dramatically. After setting the unit on ""Coarse"", I pushed the timer button and turned away to ready my other coffee-making parts (a French press needs consistent, large grounds; no powder!)... Having heard the machine bog down I turned to see smoke coming from every orifice. The grinds were extra fine instead of extra coarse and I had tried all settings... it's going back to BB&B; great folks to do biz with. I'm debating on its replacement; every grinder on the 'net has zero to five stars... sounds like they all have problems of one sort or another. KitchenAid or Virtuoso?"
3,"So/so, not for epsresso","First, its not a true burr grinder, but a plate grinder. The result is you do get a more consistant grind than with a blade grinder, but still not as consistant as a true conical burr. You are still going to get some mud in your cup when using a french press with this. Also, its noisy as heck, had horrible static electricity problems in the container for ground coffee, and wont grind fine enough for espresso. All that said, its not bad as $40 grinders go. For my money though, spend the extra and get a Capresso Infinity."
5,Awesome Grinder!!,"If you enjoy working with the 'right tool for the right job', then this grinder is exactly your game! It has multi grinder settings from course to fine and all in between. You will not appreciate any other grinder in the way you will love this one for home use. It has won my vote completely. Enjoy!!"
2,Used it for about 5 months...,"Bought this back in Nov 2010 and just last weekend (Apr 9 2011) it stopped working. Cleaned it and made sure nothing was stuck inside. When I took the top off and looked inside I noticed the grinding element actually has blades on the ends so I don't know if this is really a burr grinder. Anyhow, it's worked well to provide coarse ground coffee. Although it does produce a lot of coffee dust which will stick to the sides of the hoppper. I would probably not buy this again. Instead I would buy the kitchen aid burr grinder."
4,"Good range of grind--not as fine as I would like for espresso, though.","I am by no means a coffee/espresso snob....but I do enjoy a good latte or mocha. So for me this is a wonderful grinder at a reasonable price. I am able to grind some beans for my espresso drinks, then turn around and grind some more for a pot of coffee. I love that I can set the number of cups I want, hit the start button and walk way and it will do it's job. However, the finest setting isn't QUITE fine enough for what espresso grind ""should"" be. If you are just an average Joe like me, this grinder will be everything you need. If you feel you need the ""perfect"" grind for your espresso, keep looking. Also, if you will be grinding for espresso, keep in mind your espresso machine. If it is a decent one then you will have no issues making a great cup of espresso even with the ""not-so-perfect"" espresso grind."
3,short life span,"I have had two. They do not last very long but are excellent while they work. My current one died today 4/10/2011 one year to the day that I ordered it from Amazon. I suspect it is out of warranty. The dust problemi annoying but not a show stopper. Yep one year limited warranty. Go figger. I may be a glutton for punishment and order another. It s a good grinder but buy it for the lowest price possible,certainly not $80-$100."
1,very disapointed!,"I purchased this item on October 19, 2011 . I bought this particular grinder because it is a Cuisinart and thought it would be a reliable product.It did a good job the first few months but it suddenly stopped working at all.Furthermore, and since it is still under warranty (I got it only 4 months ago!), I contacted Cuisinart and they will replace it but after I have paid them $10 for a new one and the shipping charges back to them of the one that no longer works. Not the kind of customer service I expected from this company."
2,Cutting corners,It was clear this was engineered for price and not performance. The burrs are stamped sheet metal and don't cut but break the beans. For around the same price other grinders perform way better.
4,Just keep it clean,My grinder is around 5-6 years old with no problems other than the unit needs cleaning now and then. The hopper unscrews to reveal the burrs. After grinding the funnel guiding the beans into the burrs builds up with oily grind and packs down hard. I clean it out and give it a wash maybe twice a year. Sounds and works like new! I would buy another in a heartbeat. I use mine several times daily.
4,Fresher tasting coffee thanks to Cuisinart grinder,"I selected this grinder because my preferred coffee provider (Peet's) recommends a burr grinder. It's really nice to be able to just push a button and have just about the right amount of freshly ground coffee. My only issue with the thing is that the ""number of cups"" isn't continuously variable. 4 cups isn't quite enough, 6 is more than enough, and it won't stay positioned between the clicks. Grinding a supply and then measuring out the desired amount would rather defeat the purpose of grinding just before use."
5,Love it~!,"Hi-I bought one from Sam's Club for my mom for Christmas, then decided I wanted one and Sam's is 80 miles away round trip b) Sam's club online was sold out or didn't have. So, I turned to amazon-price was similar, our old grinder could not store any beans,so to use always had to fill with beans. This is so much easier. My one complaint is that it is NOISY-so if you are trying to make coffee while others are sleeping, grind the night before! Otherwise, we love it and it looks great on the counter top with my other stainless appliances."
1,Died after 5 months. Disappointment with CUISINART!!,"Pros:- It could grind the coffee bean.- Look nice.Cons:- Very loud noise.- Grind selector from ultra fine to coarse, doesn't work well.- No static free on plastic container that holds coffee. Very hard to get coffee all out, coffee just flying all over during this process. POOR DESIGN!!- Only last for 5 months when the unit was looking like new.Recommended:Definitely NOT! So disappointed!Cuisinart used to be the brand that I can trust. But not anymore!!Cuisinart!! You have just lost your loyal customer.Wishing someone from Cuisinart can see this type of comments to improve your products."
1,Not a good value for the money,"In the past 3 years, I have blown through 3 of these. Thank goodness I have purchased them using discount coupons. What more can I say? Noisy, doesn't last 1 year with daily use. Cuisinart has really missed the mark on this one. It's time to upgrade"
3,Cuisinart DBM-8,"It is better than the ones with blades, If you like strong coffee, and want to get all the flavor, this is for you, if you are looking for a grinder that will allow you to get coarse grind without turning some of your coffee beans in to dust, and don't mind paying big bucks keep looking, I am going to try a manual grinder,"
3,Acceptable Result,"We bought this product for our office use. So far it does the job competently. The 1/2 lbs load is a nice feature so you don't need to load the beans for every use. The grind quality is acceptable, but we do not go down to the finest grind level. It is quite noisy though."
3,Don't buy if you need for espresso,"Bought this to replace a Breville. Less money, but does NOT grind fine enough for Espresso. If you really need a variety of grinds, spend more money."
3,pros and cons,"Noisy, imprecise fineness, does not grind as fine as needed for some brewing, quality control problems (top part broke once, then died after 3 years).However, inexpensive, easy to load and empty."
2,I've finally given up and getting another machine,"Like many have reported, this machine is loud and produces a lot of dust. My major frustration is that the beans don't go into the machine consistently and it won't grind the correct amount. I've resorted to picking up the machine and shaking it so the beans will go into the mill. While I appreciate the 6am workout (sometimes), I'm going to repurpose this machine into something it may be designed to do like particle reduction for items going into the compose pile. Or maybe I'll just give it away to some unsuspecting soul. My goal is a decent mill for under $100."
2,Plastic gears,The grinder broke after a couple of years of light use. I am the only coffee drinker. The gears are cheap plastic.
3,"After two of these, I upgraded to a Capresso","After going through two of these Cuisinart grinders in six or so years, I decided to spend another $24 and get a Capresso 560. The Cuisinart works fine but is very loud. I'd usually start it and leave the room to avoid the din. Conversation is impossible when it is grinding.And both broke after a couple years.I took my broken Cuisinart apart this morning: the grinding burrs (where the work gets done) consist of two opposing plates about 3/8"" thick. The conical burrs on the Capresso look to be about an inch -- and are easy to clean.The Capresso grinds more slowly, generates less heat and static -- all good.So for me the extra $24, was worth it."
1,Not Happy,Grinder lasted one week. It arrived the 4th of June and died the 10th. It is packaged and ready to send to Cuisinart. Now I'll look for a real grinder.
5,Great,"A burr mill - that's what I have been looking for all along . I can choose any kind of grind. Forget about those ""grinders"" with a mixer blade!"
1,Automatic stop doesn't,"Have had this for less than a week, but it has been consistent. It grinds well for my purposes, drip coffee - but doesn't stop grinding as advertised. I had it set for 12 cups, and was getting the cups down, etc. while it was grinding.When I looked, it had completely filled the hopper and was still grinding. I have tried it on different quantities and back on 12 cups, and always the same results - it grinds away without regard to the setting. It is going back to the retail store this weekend."
2,Poor quality,"I used this grinder just once per week. The grinder quit working 2 months after the warranty expired. If you buy this grinder, you'll be getting the Cuisinart name but not the assumed Cuisinart quality."
1,works ok until....,works ok until you do a large load of beans at which time it appears to burn out. I suppose that if you do a pot at a time it may work for you but it is supposed to grind larger loads then that.
1,Piece of junk,I bought this grinder 2 months ago. Mostly used it to grind course coffe for french press. I took good care of the machine too. The motor died last week. Return window expired and $50 down the drain. Don't waist your money on this junk. Very disappointed with Cuisinart.
2,Worked for a couple years,My motor just went out with a puff of smoke. Seemed OK before that. Coffee bin is a little messy. The plastic housing radiates a lot of noise.I'm looking for a different brand grinder now.
3,A Mixed Picture,"Received this yesterday afternoon and was eager to use it to make my morning coffee. The very brief instruction sheet said that the removable plastic parts, the bean hopper & lid, and the grind chamber & lid, were top-shelf dishwasher safe, so I washed them there. This morning I took them out, dried them off and checked the fit of the parts and all was well. Then I noticed that there was water trapped between two parts of the bean hopper that I couldn't get out. It still grinds well and turns off when it finishes, but the trapped H2O is a worry. I have put the offending part in the window in hopes that when the sun comes out it will turn the water into vapor and it will then exit the space the same way it got in. May have to return it in exchange for another one.Note: the water evaporated from the heat of the grinding process. I now clean the hopper with a soapy sponge and spray rinse with no water problem after."
1,Messy and that overwhelms all pros of this device,"This is my first written review on Amazon because I've never felt so strongly about a product that I wanted to share my opinion. This grinder is messy. The device grinds the coffee beans into a plastic box. The plastic box has a lid on top and a hole on the side for the grinder to spit coffee into.When you open the lid and then set it down on a table, a cloud of ground coffee goes poof and you have ground coffee on your table. When I grind 4 cups worth of beans, a fourth of the ground coffee is stuck to the side of the container. When I scoop this out, the ground coffee (being statically charged) does not always land into the coffee filter. It gets in the coffee water, the table my coffee machine stands on.I tried to simply empty the contents of the container directly into the filter. This seems to work best but I still cannot avoid a mess removing the lid. It takes 100 seconds to carefully do this and it still makes a mess. This is not convenient."
1,poorly constructed,"I bought this grinder just over a year ago. A couple of months after I received it, the on/off switch went out. I called Cuisinart and promptly sent another. But, just after the warranty ran out, the same problem with the switch recurred. I don't know which brand I will replace it with, but I will now stay away from the Cuisinart. The bad switch seems to be a design flaw. Apart from that, however, the machine adequately ground the coffee beans. It also looks good, however important that might be."
1,Bad Grind,"It looks nice, and easy to use but it does NOT grind very well at all. The ""coarse"" grind creates big shards of coffee that nobody would ever use to brew drip coffee and the fine grind is more like what you WOULD use to brew drip coffee, not fine enough to brew espresso at all. Its annoying because in the directions for use it says that the fine grinds are very compact which is not true. It isn't only a fluke on this particular machine because I have had two of the same machine. One I bought six months ago and took it back and another that was given to me. Don't buy this. It is a bad product."
1,Waste of money,"My girlfriend and I both bought one of these. After less than a year of light use (1-2 times a week), both of them died!"
1,Very disappointed,Received this item as a gift. After four months of use it stopped working. Cuisinart sent a new one. Eight months later this one stopped working. Cuisinart customer service stated the item was now out of warranty based on the original purchase date and would not replace this item. I am back to using my reliable Krups fast touch coffee grinder.
1,Broke before the year was out.,I like most Cuisinart products but this coffee grinder was a terrible disappointment. It stopped working after about nine months. There is a crack in the barrel that moves the coffee through the blades. I had been told that you have to spend for a good burr grinder. I learned my lesson. Wish I had that good old Krups that I tossed to make room for this piece of junk.
3,"NOT a ""conical"" burr","This machine is a burr grinder but NOT a conical burr. This means it does NOT grind fine enough or consistent enough for espresso. Believe me. I ran a couple of pounds of beans through it for several days, under a variety of conditions just to be sure. Result: bitter shots and no crema! Not acceptable.On the other hand, it is quite satisfactory for a French Press grind which is what my wife uses. So now we have His and Hers grinders. I use the old one for espresso and she uses this one for French Press. Since we use different beans this is what we wanted to accomplish in the first place so I'm happy with the end result."
2,Questionable quality for the investment.,"I felt compelled to share a recent issue with our Cuisinart Supreme Grind. A little background: We have owned this unit for approx. 2 years. It is used 2 to 3 times per week. The quality of the grind, regardless of the setting, is accurate and consistent.Just recently the clear bean carrier or basket, broke completely off where it connects in the unit. This happened while the grinding was taking place. No, the unit was not dropped, tipped over or handled without the utmost in care. Yet, this component broke cleanly off where it meets the blade area in the unit.We are disappointed to say the least! Is this a design flaw? A materials faliure?The unit is out of warranty and Cuisinart will offer no repair or replacement.You be the judge. : ((I might add, the unit was not available, 2 years ago, in the current price range. It was more typical to see it priced closer to retail.)"
1,Just quit working...,"I don't have anything to add to all the reviews that say ""it just stopped working one day."" Probably a faulty switch since there was no burning smell from the motor. I tried to take it apart to investigate, but the molded plastic design does not allow this."
1,Why do you keep making crappy products?,"Trying to find a good, prosumer Burr Grinder is a daunting task. This one is one of the worst. Big, Clunky, EXTREMELY Loud (gets louder after the first month...?) and messy as all-get-out. The plasticky build quality (with stainless panels hot glued on) creates a static force field which impart a lovely avalanche of grinds that defy gravitational forces.The grind selector is ambitious with it's multiple settings, however it will only give you about 3 different grinds (coarse, medium and semi-fine)- which also needs to be cleaned about every 5 grinds to be even remotely accurate, which it isn't and I don't have time to clean this thing every 2 days.Bloody Awful."
1,Looks Nice But Cheap,After only 2 years of owning this product the plastic piece that joins the hopper to the grinder is broken and is unuseable. We have only used it on average once a week over the past two years and feel that it should have lasted much longer. This is the second cuisinart device to break down on me this month.
2,only lasted 2 months,"I own about 5 Cuisinart foodprocessors, 3 coffe makers, and other Cuisinart products for my homes and resturant. I have always loved their products and respect the brand. We only used this coffee grinder for 2 months before it broke. It seems like the last products I have bought from Cuisinart have not lasted, one coffee pot broke after 3 months which was replaced. One 14 cup food processor broke after 6 months of very infrequent use, which Cuisinart would not honor the warranty, charging me $100.00 to fix. This grinder when it worked was wonderful, much quieter than my last grinder, easy to use and clean. I would check other reviews to see how long their coffee grinder lasted. We used this according to the directions and only for coffee beans."
1,Not very durable,"I purchased my Cuisinart Grinder from Costco a few months ago and it worked great for about 2 months. Then arbitrarily it just stopped working. I thought it was because of something I did, so I re-read the directions in order to try and trouble-shoot the issue and found nothing in the instruction booklet that would give me a clue. Finally, I had to chalk it up to poor quality. If you are looking for a good value, don't purchase this coffee grinder. FYI...I purchased another Cuisinart coffee grinder from Bed, Bath & Beyond (different model) and had the same issue! I would recommend steering clear of this brand for coffee grinders. (Their other products work great)!"
1,CUISNART DBM-8 AUTOMATIC BURR MILL,GOOD OVERALL AESTHETIC. GOOD GRIND QUALITY FOR DRIP COFFEE MAKERS u(CAN'T COMMENT ON EXPRESSO USE). THE NOISE IS NO WORSE THAN BLADE GRINDERS AND OTHER BURR GRINDERS I HAVE HAD. YOU CAN LEAVE THE AREA DURING THE GRIND CYCLE IF THE SOUND BOTHERS YOU....THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS THAT IT STOPPED WORKING AFTER THE 2ND GRIND CYCLE.
2,"OK, but.....","I have this grinder for a little over a year. While I have been pleased overall with the machine, I have experienced many of the issues that others have identified. The ground coffee ""sticks"" and clumps in the plastic receiving container, making it just a little cumbersome to empty out. In addition, cleaning the grinder is a little challenging. Once I figured out that turning the machine over and pushing the brush around and through the grinding mechanism was the solution - I was pretty well set.Here is the ""But"" part... All of that aside, last night in mid-grind, the grinder stopped dead. I though maybe the motor was overheated and let it sit overnight. No signs of life this morning. TIme for a new grinder, and it won['t be a Cuisinart."
2,Can't cut it ...,Product didn't make it through 10 months. When grinding fine coffee it clogged. Cuisinart needs to go back to the drawing boards with this one ...
5,Great item,I bought for my brother in law 2 christmas ago. Its still in perfect condition and used daily. Would highly recommend.
1,Two grinders - both stopped working in a month,"I ordered this grinder since I generally like Cuisinart. It stopped working after a month and Amazon replaced it. The second one stopped working after two times! Horrible product. I am now going to spend 4 times the amount, but will have less frustration."
2,"Meh, Not Worth It","For $20 more you can get a quieter, more efficient Capresso machine with the actual capability of grinding to an espresso level. Don't bother here."
2,OK but poor quality and died soon,"I purchased two of these, one for me and the other as a gift. The gift one died in about 2 months with light use, just stopped working. The place where I purchased it said that I would need to ship it back to Cuisinart, not worth the shipping cost. Mine worked fine for about 18 months and died as well. I took it apart to see if I could repair it and discovered that the circuit board had failed which was not available for purchase so mine is also trash.During operation one thing I did not like was the static in the grounds hopper, the grounds would fly everywhere when poured, wish they would have used static free plastic.I purchased Cuisinart because I have used their appliances for years with good results and they were dependable, not true about this grinder."
2,Cuisinart DBM-8 Burr Mill Coffee grinder,"Cuisinart DBM-8 Supreme Grind Automatic Burr MillThe warranty on the product is 18 months. Mine failed after 2 years of once a day use. Beside that, it did not grind the beans consistently. In a batch, part of the coffee would come out the size expected, but a large percentage would be a fine grind. A cheap blade grinder does just as good a job."
2,Worked Great for 2 Years - then 0,"I bought this product because it sounded good and had an 18 month warranty. Then after 20 months it gave up the ghost and the motor burned out. The cost to repair it was the same as getting a new product. Also, the coffee grounds would fly out when the container was removed."
4,replacement burr grinder,"I had an old style burr grinder that finally died. Reviewed many differant styles and prices before deciding to try the Cuisinart. So far, so good. I use primarily Kona coffee that will occasionally clog the chute. Other than that unit performs as advertised. Grind is consistent, timer is accurate, and there really is very few grind blow out or static cling problems. I would purchase again, good value for the buck."
4,Good for the money,"In addition to this grinder, I also have a Baratza Vario that I use for espresso. To be clear, this grinder will not work for espresso. However, I think it works just fine for regular drip coffee, and keeps me from having to mess with the grind size on my Vario too much. I've had it for several years now without any issues."
2,Nothing Supreme here,"When it worked it was just okay, noise and coffee dust noted. One day it ground beans for a french press, the next day it was caput. This has happened TWICE. I shall not be getting yet another. Before owning a burr grinder, I had used one of the cheap whizzer varieties which was less than satisfactory, but I was also brewing coffee with a Mr Coffee drip machine. Then I took a ""step up"" and purchased a french press and then another ""step up"" and got the Cuisinart grinder. Now two french presses later (these guys are very delicate - they break easily) and two dead coffee grinders. I am back to square one. Purchased an aeropress - the day it arrived was when grinder #2 died. Is it really that hard to manufacture a decent grinder?"
2,Weak,We drink a ton of coffee and this thing could not keep up. We weren't making turkish or expresso either. After a short period the motor stopped.
3,Good enough!,"To reiterate what other reviewers have said: a burr grinder at this price is not going to be at all perfect. That said, it's definitely beyond serviceable, and I find it very useful when grinding coffee for my stovetop espresso maker--notice my overall level of investment here. It does, however (and at least one other reviewer mentioned this as well), leave a fine layer of dust in the chamber full of ground coffee. While this won't bother you on the finest settings (for espresso and Turkish coffee), when grinding coffee for a French press, it's a mite obnoxious because you end up with little bits of dust at the bottom of your cup--precisely what I wanted to avoid by buying a grinder. Overall, if you're cheap like me, you'll enjoy this grinder. I certainly like it very much and it works great for espresso."
2,Good if it does not die.,"I gave this machine two stars because this is the second machine that died within six months. When it grinds, it is very good, but I cannot live with an appliance that may fail at any time."
2,"An upgrade, but not consistent","I bought this grinder as an up grade to the blade coffee grinder, which it was. Great features included a 1/2 lb hopper, grind selection, cup selector and a push of a button and walla!, coffee ready to brew. This was a great grinder for a drip machine with a filter, but when I switched to a vacuum pot, I quickly realized how pathetic this machine really is. I was used to a fine grind, but this was too fine for the vacuum pot and created mud at the bottom of the pot of coffee. I tried a coarser grind, but found that it still created quite a bit of fine grind along with very coarse coffee. Not very efficient.If you are looking for convenience and use a filter, this is a good coffee mill, however, if you use a French Press, vacuum pot or screen filter, you will be unhappy as the grind is very inconsistent. You will always have a good amount of fine ground coffee."
2,Dead in less than two years,"I was happy enough with the grinder while it worked, but it crapped out after less than two years of use. Hardly worth the money with such a short lifespan."
2,Great until it broke after 11 months,"This was my first burr grinder purchase. I was happy with it until eleven months after purchase, the plastic spout which screws into the grinding area cracked, leaving large peices of plastic and a couple screws grinding along with my coffee. I won't be purchasing another Cuisinart product because I haven't had one of them last for more than a year (2 toasters in 2 years as well)."
2,50/50,"I have the Cuisinart DBM-8 Supreme Automatic Burr Grinder. It worked really well for me. So when looking at getting a Christmas gift for my mom, I thought this would be a great option. Mine is working to this day, but my moms has already broken. So while I originally thought it was a solid piece of equipment, it now looks like a crap shoot. I tried to return it, but the return window has already closed (after 1 month).In terms of my experience:1) This grinder tends to be aggressive on the grounds/cup ratio (set on 12, it easily makes 16 cups worth of ground coffee)2) There are always some really fine grounds that will go right through a reusable filter.3) It's a bit loud and takes a little while to grind, but you only have to touch it once, which is pretty nice.So mine works well - but now I have to say order at your own risk."
5,perfect machine,"I love this mill, the settings are easy to adjust which makes it easy too get just the right grind. The storage container for the coffee is a plus, no need to fill every time you grind and the automatic shutoff is great. I would recommend this unit to everyone"
1,two in 3 1/2 years - DONT BOTHER,"It does everything fairly well - for the price. But i've had TWO in the last 3 1/2 years that just STOP WORKING. This is a common problem apparently - IF you're within warranty, and IF you kept your paperwork, and IF you dont mind being without decent coffee for however long it takes for Cuisinart to repair/replace your unit - fine. Otherwise - DONT BOTHER. I've just bought another brand and you can bet i saved the paperwork."
3,Great unit for 13 months.,"I was skeptical with this when first ordering it but needed a grinder and was low on cash. $50 is what I paid and I used it every other day for the full 13 months. I ground beans for drip, pour-over, chemex and french press and it was great.Randomly the other day it stopped working and I now have a Bodum Grinder that was $70 and so far so good. for $40, I think it's a great deal!"
1,Waste of money,"Advertised as a Burr Mill but it does most of the grinding with blades that whirl like a spice grinder. Creates a LOT of powder - even on the coarsest setting. And it generates a lot of static. When you try to pour the ground coffee, it jumps all over the counter. Does a slightly better job grinding flavored coffees.Overall, you would be better off using a spice grinder and pulsing the motor until you achieve the grind you desire. Don't waste your money on the Cuisinart DBM-8. It's not a good product."
3,"No ""Ultra Fine"" Grind to Speak of","I bought this machine because Braun doesn't build the higher end grinders to last like they used to. The Cuisinart seems a fair bit sturdier, but where's the fine grind? At the finest setting, you get granulated flakes just barely acceptable for a strong cup of drip coffee. I won't waste beans to see what you get on the coarsest setting. Something crunchy for chewing purposes? Altogether, a disappointment."
2,Disappointing,"For almost $50, I thought I would be getting a good quality grinder... I was wrong. No matter what grind setting I used, it would create lots and lots of 'dust' or 'powder' that would mix in the grounds and cling in clumps to the top of the grounds holder. This was unacceptable to me for french press, or even drip brewing- it made the coffee too strong.Cough up the extra $50 and get a Capresso Infinity, like I eventually did- you won't regret it."
1,bobthechef,"This product is a great disappointment. It is very noisy which is OK but it doesn't last long The first one lasted 5 months. It was still in warranty so I contacted Cuisinart who eventually sent a replacement. The replacement lasted less than a week before it ceased to operate all together. I still have the original one waiting to be returned. Have contacted Cuisinart who, I suppose, will get back to me. I am trying to dump this product and go a=back to Capreessa which last a lot longer and is in the same price range. In recent years Cuisinart's Quality Control hass reall gone down hill."
3,Static problem,"I am one of the people that became frustrated with the mess created from static electricity. When opening the plastic receptacle, whatever coffee didn't stick to the inside would pop out all over the kitchen counter. Even in the summer it was a problem. Now that we are into the dry, 20 below Minnesota winter, I almost went back to buying ground coffee. I did, however, come up with a solution. I cut a half-inch strip of aluminum foil from the end of a roll and inserted about half of it into the plastic container. The remaining 6 inches was left to dangle out the front. I found that this totally resolved the static problem and the foil can be re-used forever."
2,not great for espresso,"Got this as a replacement for a messy old Braun burr grinder - I find it can't grind the coffee fine enough to make a good cup of espresso. We've actually kept the old Braun:Braun KMM30 Coffee/Espresso Mill, White"
2,Works great but then quits,"The first one of these Cuisinart mills that I purchased quit working after just a few weeks. I wrote the company and they sent me a new one, after I sent the broken one back. I've had this replacement for about 10 months and now it has quit as well. The mill works great when it is working but for me it didn't last very long before it broke. I have written again to Cuisinart and it has been over a week and I have not gotten a response. I can only assume they are abandoning me with this burr mill that no longer works."
2,Great well it worked,We bought this grinder about 4 months ago and it died the other day. The issue is that the drop spout for the ground coffee is to small if you don't clean it out on a daily regime it builds up and blocks the grinding chamber. This caused the motor to burn out. So if you clean it each time you use it you should not have any issues.
4,"Power, Capacity, Speed and Selection","Got beans? This thing will not only shred them, but turn it into fine dust or chunky grounds, whichever you prefer. It does it quickly and it doesn't care how many beans you want to throw in. My only concerns are that it is very loud and that you have to ensure that grind catcher clicks when you're putting it in. Overall I'm quite pleased with this industrial strength coffee grinder (unlike their grind and spew coffeemaker: http://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-DGB-600-Grind-Automatic-Coffeemaker/product-reviews/B000PJ9OXK/ref=cm_cr_dp_synop?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=0&sortBy=bySubmissionDateDescending#RK4B4S0KC1UNT )."
4,very happy with my purchase,"I can't relate to all the fuss and discontent people have had with this burr mill. Granted, I am writing this review soon after my purchase as I have only used it for 2 wks. But in that short time, I must say that I am very pleased with the grind quality, options for various settings, and apparent sturdy and aesthetically pleasing build of the machine. This is a vast step above my prior little krups bean grinder, and I am delighted to now reap the benefits of a consistent, course grind for my daily brew or 2 via french press. I am very happy with my purchase thus far."
4,Great Product at a Great Price,"Got this for under $40 on Amazon and it is a great machine. Good grind, lots of settings, and I particularly like the large hopper and the feature that lets you pick the # of cups and push the button. Very happy with it."
2,Does not grind Turkish,"The grinder works fine if the finest grind you want is espresso. However, its description seemed to offer finer grinds than that, which it failed to be able to produce even on its finest setting. This is a big disappointment."
1,Durability,"Bought this unit on 12/21/2004.The unit looks very good.The warranty is excellent.Within these past months,Cuisinart we are on our third unit.On the prvious 2 units, the switch stopped working."
1,Died after ~ 6mos,"Similar to other's experiences- it simply stopped working.When it was working:We make french press coffee: this unit didn't produce a consistent coarse grind. Lots of fine powder mixed in.Very noisy while grinding, overspeeds when hopper empties.Like all plastic coffee grinder containers- static causes the coffee grinds to stick to the sides & top.I replaced this with a KitchenAid Pro Line Pearl Metallic grinder- best one I've ever had by far, and worth every penny."
3,Excited and Dissapointed all at once!,"I didnt realize its just for coffee...I was looking for a GRAIN MILL!! But Its ok...I used it on a bag of Garbanzo Beans it took 3 days to mill and it does not go to a fine powder but I'm keeping it because I may use it for coffe one day when I remember to buy beans instead of ground coffee!it shipped incredibly fast too! I would definately buy from this seller again, but next time I'll be sure to ask questions and not assume anything!"
1,DO NOT BUY,"do not buy this. Buy something else. Anything else. I bought mine from Costco. It died on the third day. Time is so precious. To carry this dead thing back and get my money back and then go 'on the hunt' for a different burr grinder...well, what a waste. Cuisinart has made NO friends by making such a shoddy item, by inconveniencing people who have to take it, mail it, bring it back. Gas costs money too. Geez."
1,It's not even terrible,In my case I can't even say it's noisy because the grinder didn't work at all! Manufacturing defect deprived me the chance to listen how it works.
1,Awful,"This burr grinder was given to us as a gift. Over the last four years, FIVE Cuisinart products have failed us, including this one this morning. We have used it daily and have never been happy with it. The grind was extremely inconsistent, the timer rarely delivers a consistent amount of coffee, and at least every other time it was used it clogged itself up (creating a lovely screaching noise while it searched for more beans). The plastic parts are cheap. The amount of coffee dust that clings to the sides is pretty annoying, and trying to get it out makes a huge mess every morning.Finally today we threw this junk in the trash. A plastic internal threaded piece broke and if not for the backup KitchenAid grinder we have had for ten years we would be at an espresso stand buying our morning coffee.Awful."
4,Great product.,This product allows me to fine tune my coffee and its the first item I use each morning to start my day.
2,Broke in 2 Years and Unrepairable,"This unit was OK as a grinder - better than a blade grinder but not the best. Consistency was not great, and it was usually too fine. There was always a mix of fine powder produced, and some of it stuck to the output and the container. Still, it was an OK grinder until it had a massive failure. The bottom part of the bean hopper broke and jammed into the burr mechanism, freezing and destroying it. Nothing to do but trash it. I'll be looking elsewhere to replace it."
1,Garbage. Complete waste of money.,"I bought this in December 2011 as a Christmas present. We drink coffee once a day in the morning and use it then. It broke this weekend. The motor burned up. It's March 26th, 2012. So, if you want to spend forty bucks for something that works for three months, go for it. It's junk. I'm tired of every ""used to be decent company"" cheaping out and having China make their stuff. Never again, Cuisinart. I'm getting a hand grinder or using my Grandpa's old fashioned hand grinder from now on. It was made back when companies and people made good products that last."
4,good grinder for the price,"This is a good solid coffee grinder for the price. I purchased it about 4 months ago and I am pleased. As with most inexpensive grinders there is not much difference in the grinds. Suits my needs quite nicely. I did not buy from Amazon, I needed it right now and I saved 20% at a local store."
3,maybe ok but not for espresso,"purchased this to use for starbucks barista espresso machine and bialetti moka pot. it seems to work well enough for moka but will not grind fine enough and consistently enough for proper espresso. from my research it appears you need to spend a min. of $200 for a burr grinder that will grind espresso properly, e.g. gaggia grinder."
1,"coffee grinder fail,s",This is the second Cuisinart product to fail in a short time.The motor would run but grind wheel did not turn. I had a coffee maker of this brand to fail after about one month. When it was working i had no problems with it. There are a lot better products out there bodum antiguafor one.
2,OK while it lasted,"I bought this model elsewhere (Macy's) a little more than a year ago to replace a similarly priced Krups that never gave an acceptable grind. It was better while it lasted. On Christmas morning I ground some beans but when I went to empty the basket nothing was there! So I cleaned it up and checked to make sure nothing was jammed or interfering with the beans dropping to the mill. Nothing. Plugged it in again and tried and this time there was simply no power; wouldn't turn on at all even though that receptacle put power to other appliances and it didn't work in other receptacles either that had power (i.e., no tripped circuit breaker).So one more item for the landfill. I am fast coming to the conclusion that those manufacturers who0 are trading on a name and prior reputation but have shifted to mass marketing simply don't deserve to keep their former reputation. Cuisinart, Kitchen Aid, and Krups are several to which this comment aptly applies."
3,Harmon Mute arrives damaged,"Shipper must have seen my review because they contacted me to resolve my problem. It seems I sent my inquiry to the wrong email address. Shipper promptly investigated my claim and very quickly determined that I should have a new item shipped.Shipper did not wait for me to return damaged item. Shipper immediately shipped out a new item. I must apologize to shipper since once they learned of my issue, it was immediately and favorably resolved.I received this item to be given to my son as a Christmas gift. The item arrived damaged with a dent. I contacted the shipper who failed to respond to my inquiry."
4,Purchased for my daughter,Used in jazz band. She is pleased with it. Harmon is a well-respected brand for such equipment. Her previous (non-Harmon) mute fell apart.
1,"Buggy, Unreliable, Frustrating, Scary","Source Code Management, no doubt, is a vital part of any development shop. Any team based development effort needs a centralized repository in which to store their work.That being said, I would implore you to choose another product - such as the open source CVS (which can hook into VS.net with the right plug-ins).VSS is a buggy, unreliable, unbearably slow...and fundamentally unuseable product. This is *not* the sort of system you should use hold vital data that ammounts to months and months of hard work.For your sanity and your time, DO NOT buy this product. As each version seems to bring very little in the way of rethinking this disaster, Microsoft has made it very clear that they could care less about source control.(by the way, MS doesn't even use this product in-house)."
1,worthless,"about a month after purchase, its first day in the relatively weak bay area sunlight, it disintegrated into a dandelion poof of worthlessness.. also ripped freakishly easily.. invest the extra 20 bucks and just get a Motogear Deluxe Motorcycle Cover - Cruiser - sturdy, breathable, water/tear-proof"
5,Classic X-Large Motorcycle Cover,"Bought this cover someplace other than Amazon back in November. I have an outdoor covered area for the bike, so sunlight exposure is not a big issue. It has been parked in sunlight on occasion, including light rain, with no ill effects. Generally, I love this cover. It is light weight, seems pretty well made, and fits my Honda Goldwing GL1500SE like it was custom made. The ease of use for this cover is nothing short of amazing. There are heavier covers available, but I have found that if it is a struggle to cover a boat, motorcycle, etc., the cover usually doesn't get used all that much. I you are looking for long term storage, a heavier cover may be the way to go. But, for everyday use, you cannot beat the fit, and ease of use for this one. It has heavy duty material near the exhaust pipes area to prevent burns, and an anti-scratch material near the windshield. The elastic material around the bottom edge keeps it fitting like a glove. Rate this A+"
3,Too easily torn,"Within a week the cover was cut or torn in a cross pattern. Could have been a vandal, could have been cheap construction. I would just expect something like the ""rip stop"" weave you get with tarp. When I examine the tear/cut, there really isn't much material there....This cover is easier to put over the bike that others have been. I have had 5 in the last 2 years, and only been happy with one... which someone stole..."
2,Looks nice,"This cover disintegrated in a month or so. Yeah, you get what you pay for. This brand is not happening for me again."
1,Do Not Buy!,"If you're looking for a chair that is comfortable, stable, and will last you a while... look elsewhere. After having this chair for a few short months, the back broke off, the wheels kept popping off, and I would find random pieces of the chair on my floor. I contacted the company and they were nice enough to send a new one, which was great. I really do appreciate their customer service. However, a few months later the back broke off again. I've been using the chair backless now for a few months because I can't afford to keep buying chairs. But now the wheels keep popping off every single time I move the chair an inch. It's VERY frustrating. Time to buy a new chair. Again.One and only positive... it actually IS comfortable... before it breaks apart."
5,Power: A Scientific Approach,This book was very helpful to my training and created a totally new view on how to approach training to receive the maximum potential of strength.
1,This book is junk,"The [money] I spent on this book was a waste. The arthur used his reputation to peddle a inferior book on training. The book may work in middle schools, but one could easily find more in depth articles online and in journals. Very little is given in terms of theory or application and more emphasis is given to rudimentary biological processes. I find this book to be a complete waste of a few hours better spent elsewhere."
1,Absolutely useless,"I can't say too much about this product as I couldn't figure out how to use their lesson plans! No instructions, just a bunch of CD roms. The packaging looks glitzy, but inside it was junk. I will be returning this product to the manufacturer."
4,Good for the collection,"I picked up Time Capsule while browsing in FYE. I was so happy to see some of my favorite artist on DVD. It took me back to those days when the music was still fun. 12 years. Wow! If you are complaining about the quality now, what are you going to say when they come out with the best of 1979? Get over the quality issue and just be happy somebody care enough to preserve this precious and STILL overlooked artform we call Hip Hop. The live performances are hot. I'm sure they will get better as they go along. Time Capsule is a Good start. BUY it!"
1,1 Star for the nice try - but that's about it!,"Being two true oldschool hip hop heads, we couldn't await to see what's on this DVD - BUT WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!!! Check the other reviews: poor quality of sound and size (size DOES matter!!!) plus the videos are shortened to only about 2 mins. each. Luckily we have a good selection of our very own video tapes from the good ol' days featuring the best that Yo!MTV Raps had to offer plus all the good stuff that was on VH1 SOUL last year, and thanks to modern technology it's on DVD too! So we got the proof that it could have been done way better. If this is the closest that YOU can get to oldschool videos - sorry for you! It might be better than nothing. But maybe you're better off checking the net for better sources... ;-)""Justice evolves only after injustice is defeated""Peace."
2,A DISAPPOINTMENT,"Agree with the viewer from Dayton. These are not full-screen videos but are actually two-thirds normal size and framed with a goofy red matte to make them appear larger. Interviews with rappers are shrunk down to even smaller windows. Whoever created the DVD master did rap fans a great disservice. Although it would be wrong to expect 10-year old videos to match today's technical standards, it doesn't appear that this compilation was created from original source videos. If you're truly desperate to view some hip hop history, buy it--it does contain some good musical choices. Otherwise, wait for a company that has a sincere respect for the music to put out a ""hip hop time capsule"" compilation worthy of the name."
5,Experience the music!,"What an extraordinary New Year's Eve concert! The title is some how misleading, the concert is a serious one with classical as well as crossover Brazilian music, the accepted norm in Brazil, that includes the samba melodic and rhythm characteristics. Composers from Argentina and Brazil are represented. The music is modern, vibrant, with incredible sounds and rhythms, and most important: beautiful and well performed.Listening and watching this DVD you are rapidly embedded in the joy the orchestra, the chorus, the conductor and the audience express in their music. A real treat for those of us who don't live in Brazil. I can only hope that next year's concert will be even more exciting and a DVD will be produced for all to enjoy.Highly recommended."
4,Basic cabin-building for enthusiastic beginners.,"Title says it all. With this book, an axe, and a Swede saw, I built my own home in the northern woods (Yukon). Angier's enthusiasm, and can-do attitude overcomes the obstacles and leads you to an unforgetable experience. Lots of fun"
5,Why is Prestige discontinuing this marvelous color?,"Dear Prestige,First I bought out Walgreens when they told me they would not be carrying this product. Then I bought out Ulta. Finally, I've bought all ""Madrid"" Prestige lipsticks on Amazon. What now?"
4,"A Must Read in Our Modern ""Extend Government"" Times","This book reveals Coolidge as the true forerunner of Reagan. Government only need intrude as much as is necessary and constitutional. Any more, and it is an infringement on human freedom. From his handling of the police strike to his economic policy as President, this is an often discounted President. A solid work dating close to Coolidge's Presidency. Contains some anachronisms, but still solid reading."
2,"Jim Reeves , Ray Price & Ernest Tubb DVD","While the slicked down hair of the guys, and the fluffy dresses and pig tails of the gals presented fond memories of the 1950s, I was disappointed in that most of the tunes performed by these three great artists, with a few exceptions, were relatively obscure tunes. The three perfomers did get equal playing time throughout the DVD which I felt was a good thing."
5,Equals C.S. Lewis in honesty and depth of emotion,"This book saved me. I have read it twice and the heartfelt emotion of grief speaks clearly in every chapter. I gave it to a friend who had recently become widowed at a young age and it helped her with her grief enormously. Since that time, I have had several requests for the book, and I am going to order additional copies to loan out.Although Ms. Ericson writes about her own husband's death, the experience of grief and loss in her book transcends her own situation. This book is the only book on grief that I can compare with C.S. Lewis's ""A Grief Observed."" When one is grieving, he or she can only grab onto someone else's experience who understands their own. I highly recommend this wonderful book to anyone who has experienced any loss of any type."
4,compaion through darkness,This book helped me to understand that what I am going through is normal and that I am not going crazy or having pitty parties for myself. It was really helpful
5,This book translates raw emotion into words.,"I have read every book there is on the grief journey after the death of a spouse. This is the best. The author doesn't muddle her story with psychology and explanations. She relates in incredibly clear style how it is when your spouse dies. She describes the indescribable. This book sould be read by every widowed person. It would be a source of understanding for those who want to provide comfort to a new widow or widower, including professional support persons."
5,Very good,This book hit so many cords that forced me to examine my own emotions. It has helped me tremendously to work thru the grief.
3,Satisfactory,"This DVD is ok. I think the DVD is not very long in the sense that it only lasts for around 20 minutes (if that!). The fertility massages, accupressure and how to make castor oil pack is quite good. But i think because the fertility massage is only for 3 to 5 minutes you may have to repeat the dvd a few times before you grasp the skill for yourself.I also had to pay a customs charge of 11.65 which i was not made aware of when i purchased this dvd. I also paid the postage and packaging costs of $12 (approx)when i purchased the dvd. I thought this was very unfair and missleading. I think the item itself is overpriced for what it is."
4,Classical Guitar,"It was a gift for my father who turned 88 on March 1st.I sent it to him in Spain. He has been a guitar teacher all his life and still has students now in his ripe old age. He loved it, loved the music, loved the way they play."
5,"You want the best, this is it!","There is so much dull, mediocre pop out there at the moment you will find anthems a blast of fresh air, even if it is four years old. The album does not have a weak track on it, and if you like your music real, pumping and stong then this is a must! It's great to come in on a Friday night and put this terrific album on to get you in the mood for a party weekend, the mixture of dance, rock and indie tracks is seamless. If you want an album that sums up what music was about in the second half of the nineties, then Anthems is it."
3,Not as Relevant as I'd Hoped,"I'm a big fan of the Smart Pages Series. However, I didn't find this book as useful. There is a lot of ""clip art"" in this book. Pictures of illustrated children, some printed announcements, etc. If any of the Smart Pages books needed to have a CD, this would be it. To use any of the actual clip art, you will be cutting and pasting and doing the same with your designed material to finish the piece. Very little of it is complete items that you could just copy and be done with. Also, the layout doesn't lend itself easily to removing the clip art for use.Bottom line, this book has some great ideas, but could use some help in its execution."
3,Convenient pop-up goal - a bit tricky to take down,"The Jugs Instant Gooooal is a convenient, portable, small soccer goal (or mesh backstop). It is easy to carry to the back yard or to a neigbors yard or to a park. Just remove it from its bag, and bang the goal pops up ready to use. Small ground stakes do a great job keeping the goal anchored. The one down side with such an easy ""automatic"" setup, is that there is a bit of a technique to reversing the process. Once you get the hang of correctly collapsing the goal, it's pretty easy. If the goal isn't collapsed correctly, it won't fit in its carrying bag. All in all, we are very pleased with the goal and use it regularly."
4,Good chair,I got what I paid for but it i way too small for us big fellas. These chairs should be bought for kids or petite men and/or ladies.
4,Go Wildcats!,These chairs are exactly what I expected. The colors (purple and black) are bright and bold and the chairs seem quite durable.We are really happy with them.
3,Definitely the Bass Queen!!!,"I for one liked this cd. Typical Baby Anne and Icey. Its Just as good as the first volume, and to pizicato5 hello this isn't drum and bass its break beat, there's a deference. I suggest to anyone to buy it!"
2,Not a Fan of this CD by Baby Anne,"After purchasing Baby Anne's first CD, I kept an eye out for the second one. Well, I bought it without checking it out figuring that it would blow the first one away... This was a mistake! Baby Anne's ""v5.1"" sounds terrible on here, lots of background static. ""She Said"" is extremely repetitive. Remixes that I have heard of it are cool, though. ""Get Into it"" by Montana Rangers is cool, but find it elsewhere. ""Body Movin"" by Baby Anne is o.k., but find this elsewhere also. Do not waste your money on this one! Baby Anne is coming out with a new disc ""Dark Side of the Boom"" soon, and hopefully the ""third time will be a charm"". If my review was helpful, then don't forget to vote. THANKS!"
5,FOOLSCROW,"Being an enrolled Native-American myself, and having a good understanding of the history of Native/Anglo encounters, I recommend this book highly as an accurate description of life on the plains during the last days of the Blackfeet... brilliant!"
1,Bad,"This book is incredibly boring and tedious to read. It has no plot; I fell asleep every time I tried to read it. It isn't realistic, as some attest, becuase the Indians have the ability to talk to animals. Remarkably, their dreams are always perfectly accurate prophecies; James Welch takes foreshadowing a little too far. A final warning: this book is not appropriate for younger readers due to excessive descriptions of sexual desires and acts, including adultery and incest."
1,"boring, boring, boring",I must say that this was one of the most boring books i have ever read in my life. It is a complete waste of time to read this book. There is no plot. Honestly i would rather pull my own teeth out then read this book again. This book is pretty much 400 pages of wasted paper. If I even have to look at this book again i will probably throw up. Anyway i hope this was helpful to anyone wanting to read Fools Crow. If you ask me it just sucked.
3,This is NOT About Frank Fools Crow!,"It should be strongly noted that this is NOT the same as the 'Fools Crow' book by Thomas E. Mails, which is NONFICTION and about the Lakota Holy Man Frank Fools Crow. Anyone looking for those books needs to look under Thomas E. Mails, or further down their 'search' list.I tried not to rate it because I haven't read this book, but Amazon wouldn't let me get away with it, so don't take my rating as anything regarding the quality of the book."
3,A strong book with some shortcomings,"I recently read this book and had mixed feelings after finishing it. The book gives an amazing look inside the culture of the Native Americans, and its authenticity can't be beaten. However, the book stretches itself too thin, attempting to develop far too many characters at once and taking away from the main characters and the central plot. The book has lots of storylines, but none of them tie together very well. The end of the book leaves you waiting for some sort of resolution to a lot of the different stories, but it never comes. This book is an excellent read if you are looking to learn more about Native American culture, but it suffers from some serious problems as well."
5,Western expansion as experienced by a young Blackfoot man.,"FOOL'S CROW is the story of an Indian boy, who becomes awarrior, then a medicine man, as the White Man encroachesupon his people's territory. This book depicts what lifemight have been like for the Plains Indian. Welch managesto maintain a compassionate balance in his portrayals ofwhite and Indian characters alike. An American Indian ofBlackfoot and Gros Venture extraction, Welch draws heavilyfrom his own family's oral history in this novel."
1,"So boring, having to read this felt like punishment.",I was forced to read this for a history class. I felt like I had done something wrong and was being punished. Everytime I picked it up was torture. I read the page numbers like a child in class watching the hand of a clock. A half page felt like a gift because it was done so quickly. It skips around and every small glimmer of interesting plot is swiftly disguarded. If you have any option at all to avoid reading this book please consider your self lucky.
3,An approrpiate title to this cd,"Admittedly I was initally disappointed only because I so much enjoyed two of Kim Pensyl's earlier releases where he used more sampling and keyboards (""Three Day Weekend"", 1992, and ""Eyes of Wonder"", 1994). However, to my suprise, I find myself returning to this cd because there are some catchy, fun and heartfelt tunes here, and some can be quite memorable. If any of these tracks were to be played on a jazz station, especially a typical smooth jazz station where a lot of the jazz played sounds too similar, it would definitely stick out. However, I'm not sure that Kim Pensyl can be categorized as a ""smooth jazz"" musician. He is, though, and without question, an extremely talented musician."
5,awesome book,"This is a book from my childhood that I used to love. I just bought another copy so I could have it in my home and share it with my grandchildren. Also, I have 2 sons - Joe & Sam, so that makes the story even better!"
4,Saving Grace,"This is comfortable and easy to use. It is keeping me in my pre-pregnancy pants and shirts much longer. I find myself adjusting it a lot, but that might just be part of getting used to it. The material is nice and sturdy, and the size is perfect! It is a little long to wear stretched to full length during early pregnancy, and bunches a tiny bit under fitted shirts if you fold it, but I can already tell it will be perfect when my belly is larger.A great way to save some cash and get more use out of pre-pregnancy clothes!"
5,My grandfather was Mr. Gargiulo who sold produce in NYC.,We spoke to the author after hearing the book read on a children's TV show early one morning. My mom said the painting of the green grocer actually looked like my grandfather who passed away in 1949 before I was born. It gave us great pride in our family. The book captures the age before readily available voice technology. Those immigrants could not reach back to their loved ones without using very slow mail. How difficult that must have been.
1,IT'S A SINGLE!,"great song, i love this group, emphasis on the singular SONG! because it's a single!!!! nowhere did amazon indicate that this is a single, i'm furious, and i'm contacting them to complain. how obnoxious--no need to spend $10 on one bloody song."
4,Belive like they do.,"I had to read this book for school so I naturally was scheptical at the beginning. But within the first page they had already started the planning to ambush 6 people fishing in their pond. Being an adolecent, that's all that it took. From then on out it was a great story about two tribes in eastern nigeria fighting with both phisical and spiritual weapons. One of the most intreaging aspects of this whole book is how these people zealously these african people belive in the gods. This is a great book about the a culture completely different than ours. It is a learning experience. But the reason that I gave it 4 stars is that I found the end to be dissapointing but with deeper meaning. All in all it is a great book."
1,It's not the way it really is !!,"If someone reads and enjoys this book that's fine. Just don't read it as being the way people in Mississippi really live and act. This is a description of how mythical people at the very bottom of the social ladder might be expected to behave if they all lived in the same small area, and not influenced at all by any collective morality or common sense. It's fiction / make believe. Taken as that, it's something to read. But it's not the way Mississippi is."
2,too much of bad things can't be good,"Usually I am able to fly through books by Larry Brown. I've typically enjoyed the quirkiness of his characters, especially in the short story form.Rabbit Factory was basically filled with less than endearing individuals, (hookers, mobsters, alcoholics, men with penile dysfunction) which in my opinion was difficult to deal with. In his other novels there had been some characters that created balance (i.e. Fay which had the police officer to offset her dysfunction) After months of wanting to finish this novel, I finally, with great disappointment, put it down for possible future reading."
3,Not Larry Brown's Best,"I love Larry Brown stories, but I have to confess that there is some truth to some of the negative comments posted in previous reviews (though I wouldn't go so far with the gouging the eyes out bit). This just isn't a strong story and even the writing wasn't all that. Larry Brown created substantially better works with ""Fay"", ""Joe"" and ""Father and Son""; for anyone that is interested in Brown I'd suggest starting with those titles. I'm giving this review 3 stars instead of 2 because, well, it's Larry Brown, and anyone that's read any of the above listed titles will know what I mean."
3,Disappointed Larry Brown fan,"I am a fan of Larry Brown's books, but this one did not live up to my expectations of his writing based on the other books I have read. I gave the book 3 stars, because it was definitely a page turner, but in the end I was sorry that there wasn't some closure. I had too many questions left at the end, and I am still wondering what happened to some of the characters and their relationships. I think the book ended way too soon, and stopped short of providing that completed feeling at the end of the story."
5,Who's the boss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"That question is answered right off the bat.This band is pretty amazing,if ya like hardcore/grind/metal all at once,and ya like a good gutteral scream every now and then,by all means pick this up.Besides theyve got the coolest name out there.The follow up album-danza 2 electric boogalu,is also worth its weight in heaviness.I like it,but Im sure that alot of people wont get it.Remember its art,and the more people who dont get it the better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1"
1,Don't bother...,"I was expecting a lot more from a band that came up with such a creative name. Although, what I got was an album that sounded like a teen garage band. The vocals are WAY too loud and drown out the music The musicians do not sound good together. The CD sounds way too compressed with no clarity."
4,Majestic Choir and Organ,Fine choice of choral music. I listen to this one again and again. Uplifting and enchanting.
1,Terrible Visual Aids,"The Complete French Learning Suite has numerous problems with it. The Vocabulary lists must be created by yourself by typing every word in, and there are glitches with the flashcard system. If you've had at least 2 years of high school French, you will find what the software offers to be too basic and simple. Not worth it if you're considering learning French beyond the few travel phrases."
2,Not worth it.,"This product is only good for increasing your vocab. skills with the vocabulary master. The voice record won't work with Windows 98 even after calling and trying to download a program that was supposed to fix the problem. It did however help to increase my reading ability, but not speaking ability. The program is a bit boring."
1,Not a good program,"It did not work well with my computer. In spite of doing a full install it was necessary to keep changing CD's. The video files would not automatically open and would not open from the CD. I had to find them on my hard drive, interrupting the lesson. It was very poorly designed and not well intergrated. I lost money on this one. It's in the trash."
1,Windham Hill,"The sound tracks are pleasant and typical of Windham Hill; reason enough for purchasing. However, I have been profoundly disappointed with the DVD product. I was originally acquainted with the Laser Disc releases in the late 1980s and remembered them as visually stunning. However, the quality of video imagery on the DVD version is very poor resolution and not at all comparable to what is shown on the cover. Unfortunately there is better satisfaction from CD versions without distracting video."
3,Juss' a little dissapointed!,"Well,I am a fan of the Autumn Portrait DVD, and I must say that this here Water's Edge is no Autumn Portrait. Lots of industial oriented landscapes. Huge oil tanker looking boat scene was a bit much, not to mention long scenes of a bridges with cars passing by. Given all the scenes were on ""the waters edge"", but just not enough nature for me.Music was great as always and what nature scenes it does have are wonderfull......."
2,Reissue shows its age,"Ignoring for the moment the artistic merit of new age music -- you wouldn't be reading this review if you weren't predisposed to enjoy it -- this DVD shows the age of its release. Pioneer doesn't say whether this reissue was created from original materials or from captured LaserDisc frames; it shows all the wear and tear of a print at a second-run art house! Get used to black specks, white spots, and the occasional vertical bars from a color sync problem on the left side of the picture. Sound quality is acceptable. (You get your choice of PCM or Dolby Digital.) My advice: buy the excerpted CD's instead, and skip the DVD -- unless you just fell in love with some scene from your old LaserDisc copy. You are of an age that you bought the LaserDisc in 1984, right? Sure, I knew you did... Why else would you even be considering this DVD?"
3,The music can get monotonous,"I enjoy environmental CDs, usually rain or ocean waves. Although I've had CDs with music in addition to the natural sounds, I've usually found them a little repetitious. They're not something one can put on repeat and play continuously in the background. I got Water's Path because I thought it might provide a visual input missing from the environmental CDs. The music did in fact produce a sense of monotony, almost irritation, but the scenes were lovely. I play the film on a 52 inch screen, so it's almost like looking out of a window. When I find the music too much to deal with, I put the sound on mute."
4,beautiful,"Excellent, better than c.d. quality d.v.d that is crisp with beautiful imagry. Dissapointing length. If The Three Stooges can have 222 minutes on a d.v.d. why only 50 minutes here?"
4,Nice addition,I just got three Zen Stones for gifts. I only purchased one skin since I wasn't sure how they would be. I'm regretting not getting two more because they fit nice and have a clip on the back. The Zen Stone is so small and smooth it will almost get lost in your pocket. I think the clip will come in handy. I've attached some photos so you can see how it fits. All of the ports you need to get to are accessible. The LED is easy to see through the skin too so it's not an issue. I have the black skin but it's really a transparent grayish colour. I would have given it 5 stars but I think the price is on the high side.
2,Poor Quality Clip,"The design of the case itself is excellent. It is sleek and fits perfectly. The clip itself is removable from the actual silicone case.Unfortunately, there is one major flaw: the clip is built from very poor quality fragile plastic. After using the clip for a couple of weeks, the hinge of the clip snaps, splitting the clip into two pieces. I have removed the broken clip from the case, just using it as a skin now. The clip itself should have been made with metal instead of plastic.The clip was great while it lasted; unfortunately, it didn't last very long. Because the clip slides into a slot built into the back of the case, it may be possible to improvise a substitute replacement clip,"
3,No other Choice,I like my Zen except for the lack of a clip. This skin is the only option you have to add a clip and I don't like it because it is very hard to operate the clip without pressing the skip button on the Zen. At first you try to be carefull but then it just becomes a pain....
3,My Creative Zen Stone Skin (Black),"From a protection standpoint, the skin works great! It protects my Zen Stone from bumps, scratches, etc. The clip works well, too....but if you're not careful, it can slide out of the skin. Mine worked halfway out once before I discovered it. On the whole, though, the skin does a fine job of protecting the player without adding too much weight or bulk. All the controls are accessible - even the lanyard hole - which I use because of the Zen's miniscule weight!Henry Savelli"
1,A leaking kettle,After I opened the box and filled the product with water it immadietely started leaking water from the bottom.Returned the item next day
5,"Holy Smokin' Guitars, Batman!","If you don't love this one you had better check your pulse. Now that Luther's gone maybe he'll even get a Granny... er, Grammy. If you regret buying this one I'll bet you $500 you ain't a guitar player. Don't hesitate... guaranteed pure pleasure from one of the best... ever."
1,Amazon sucks,"Downloaded this file and it will not play in media player because it has the amazon extension.Amazon also has no way to contact them to help resolve this issue, WHY? Why is there no obvious link to contact amazon to take care of this? AMAZON address this issueTime to close my account."
5,The best of Chicago Bluesmen,"I have heard him many times; when he played in New York, and in Wisconsin. I am a friend of his and his fellow musicians. This album contains many of his recent hits which were W.C. Handy winners for several years previous to his untimely death. I enjoyed his outstanding new songs also. I highly recommend this album to any blues lover. He will be missed by many of his fans."
1,Big bulky cumbersome,"I got this for $29.99 at Aldi supermarket. I thought it would be a great product since the Dirt Devil name is well known in the vaccum industry. There is a reason they don't make these anymore. The product is not easy to work with. Its like moving an 8"" high rectangle back and forth. There is an ear-piercing whistle that comes out. The dirty water reservoir is not detachable and therefore hard to dry. I'm considering a more expensive and useful replacement!"
4,Great item !,For small spots (doggie accidents :-)) this is the tool to have !! First one lasted about 3 years. This is my second purchased (have 3 little dogs and lots of carpet).
1,Worthless,"Bought this item and brought it home. Never could get the solution to spray out the front. ""Primed"" it over 100 times, nothing. Took it back and exchanged it thinking i must have picked a bad one. Nope, second one did it also. And the number on the side you are supposed to call for customer service. Forget it, they never answer. I held on for 45 minutes one time no answer. Sent an email trying to get customer service. Nothing. Buy the Green Machine, you will get about a year out of it until the solution tube clogs up."
1,Most worthless appliance I ever bought.,I purchased this item from a traditional vendor. It was absolutely worthless! It is literally so loud you have to wear hearing protection to use it or your ears ring for several minutes afterward. Most of the water it sucks up gets sprayed back out the exhaust vent and all over your clothes and the room you are using it in. I threw it out after a couple of times using it. Don't waste your money.
2,not that great,Liked the size of this machine and thought it would be nice for spills and pet troubles...it doesn't do any better job than a can of carpet cleaner and a rag. It didn't scrub that great and didn't suck up the water it puts out. I guess you get what you pay for.
2,disappointing,I had higher hopes for this machine....it doesn't hardly scrub or suction at all and is EXTREMELY loud! Louder than some of the tools my husband uses in the garage with ear protection. My full size Hoover upright carpet cleaner has replaced this since it has hand held attachments that are great for spots and furniture.
1,Worst Cleaner EVER,"All the negatives (so loud it probably violates noise laws and certainly makes your ears ring, spews crap from the side vents, very difficult to open the tank, etc) from the other reviews all apply to this thing and are completely accurate.In addition, this thing doesn't clean spots worth a darn.If you really feel like buying this thing, do yourself a favor and just take a $50 bill from your wallet and hold a match to it. You will thank yourself later when you don't actually have to use this horrific device and you'll still be out the purchase price. I mean really, I can't find one positive thing to say about this thing.Too bad we bought it from Target or we would have known from the reviews on Amazon that it was so bad.. what a waste."
2,Not happy pet owner,"I wish I had checked reviews on this before I bought. I have used it a few times, it does not do a very good job. I find I still need to haul the big carpet cleaner to get the spots cleaned up. I have cats and a dog that hates thunderstorms, so the messes occur regularly enough (hair balls, vomit, etc.) and it just doesn't clean them up very well."
1,Do not buy this,I borrowed this from my landlord and it is HORRIBLE. We have a green machine in storage that I have used for the past few years and it works well. This machine did not work at all (except for the spin brush thing). It sprayed water and cleaner all over from the side vents and did not suck up anything.
1,Glad I got it at yard sale,Bought it at a yard sale in NEW condition for 5 bucks...worthless piece of junk...Noticed many people rate the Dirt Devil low because of this and that problem..Here is a BIG problem..the tube that is used to vac up the liquid is so small that it will plug very easy and is made in a solid piece so trying to clean it is a nightmare and you really can't get everything out..even using a high pressure nozzle on a garden hose...even tried my air compressor at 150 PSI to blow it clean..Bottom line...even at 5 bucks it will end up at my next yard sale or in the trash...
1,Does clean well but has design flaws,"Along with joy, small children bring messes and spills to a household. While this does a reasonable decent job of spot carpet cleaning, it tends to spew the dirty water out of the sides of the tank (even when the tank is not full!). As the purpose of a spot cleaner is to remove the dirt from the carpet (or upholstery or whatever), the fact that this spews that dirty water right back out makes this a fairly useless appliance! Try another one!"
1,0 stars if possible!!!,Spits out the disgusting thing you are cleaing up at you as you clean! I couldn't believe it. How nasty do you get?
1,Almost as gross as the carpet stain...,"This little machine could be handy for small stains, but it's horrible if you want to clean up messes from dog urine which is what I bought it for. What makes it so icky is that even before the reservoir that holds the dirty water you've sucked from the carpet fills, it begins to spit that dirty water out the side of the machine. Yag! Right back on to you and your carpet... Almost as infuriating is how hard it is to detached the cap on the dirty water reservoir... Avoid this little demon, it's not a good product!"
3,its is what it is..........,"This is an ok scrubber, but I wish I would have done some more looking around before purchasing it. I wish I had one with heat and this scrubber is HARD TO CLEAN AND FILLING WITH WATER IS DIFFICULT. It is also hard to dry out and keep it smelling fresh as you cannot get anyhting in side to dry the sides or bottom of water resivior."
1,Not good!,"Given the size of this thing, I certainly thought it would work better. The amount of solution/water that is needed is laughable! It felt like I was putting water in an iron, so that means if you have multiple spots, for each one you have to stop and refill the solution. Save your money and find a better product!"
1,Poor design and performance,"I bought this since we have two dogs and a teenager. It is worthless.The dirty water storage is minimal, despite the appearance. Once the container has about 1/2 inch of dirty water in the base, it starts spewing through the vents, not something you want when cleaning up dog accidents from the carpet. Opening the tank to pour out the dirty water involves pliers since the plug doesn't want to come out.Don't buy this item. I'm looking at others to purchase to replace the one I stupidly bought."
1,Ughhhhhh......,"Ok, so I had wanted to buy a Bissell Spot Bot but bought this instead because it was cheaper. BIG MISTAKE. I have had this thing for a little over a year and I HATE it! It cleans but you have to move the cleaner in the opposite direction of the brush to actually get it to clean the spot. Also, it spews stinky kitty puke water back at you and it reaks!! I clean it every time I use it but there is something stuck somewhere that I can't seem to get to. Not to mention, it's EXTREMELY loud, I mean plane-taking-off loud, and it's ridiculously difficult to remove the dirty water reservoir. I'm pricing spot bots online right now because I can't take it anymore. Please do yourself a favor and do not purchase this product."
3,Worth the $39.00.,"Don't expect a lot out of this deep cleaner. It was designed for cleaning spots on carpets here and there.... NOT larger areas. It works pretty good sucking up dirty water on carpeted steps. I had to use a garden sprayer to wet them first.. then I scrubbed them with a scrub brush. The Dirt Devil did a decent job sucking up the water. It's probably worth the $39.00 but not much more. To tell the truth, I'm kind of looking forward to the next time my cat to pukes ;)Happy Cleaning!"
4,Great Family Flick,This movie is something that you can really watch with your kids and not have to worry about what they might glean from it. Many of the actors in this film were actual Skyline High students and they have a comradery that carries throughout. Plus much of the films proceeds go back to the school where it was filmed and help fund the arts programs. Can't wait to get my copy!
4,Good Quality,"Good Quality, but all and all a little bit small. I could have one more long but the silk soaks up all of the moisture for sure."
5,My favoirte so far!,They have just the right amount of fabric that makes swabbing very easy. I feel that they are less abrasive because of the lower friction.
1,funny but..,"yes it is funny but I mean is that what you really care about? The SAT is a drag and although this book might entertain you it will not help you prepare. To prepare buy Barrons, 10 Reals and a math workbook and STUDY. It will be boring but well worth the results. DO NOT buy this book."
3,of a certain age,"If you are still in your twenties, or thereabouts, or younger, this book might appeal to you. If you're beyond the setting up, getting your life in order phase, London is the Best etc will probably offer little to interest you. Books have their genres and niches, and this one is for the young chick-lit set. But unless you're into ""what should I do about him/her"", don't expect anything profound or even entertaining."
3,Pretty Good,"I enjoyed this book for the most part. It takes place over 2-3 days, but the pacing is very slow and that sort of soured it for me. Pacing aside, the book is very well written. Emmy and her brother are very conflicted and try to come to grips with things happening in her life. I thought Emmy's resolution with Matt was very realistic and not hokey. I would have liked the storyline between Josh and Elizabeth better explained. Overall, this was a compelling read. I would recommend it and would read others by her."
4,Great Summer Read,"LONDON was a great, quick read about the choices we make in life. My favorite insightful line was: ""You need to choose among the choices that are there, and not the ones that aren't anymore. At least now how you need them to be. You're still stuck on some imaginary idea you have of how it could have been. You need to think about how it is now. And how you want it to be.""Emmy makes her first choice when she abandons her fiance in a hotel room because she just can't imagine being with him for the rest of her life. From there, she moves to a small fishing town in Rhode Island to just catch her breath and get away from everyone, something we've all wanted to do at some point or another.The novel's characters were all likeable, despite any hurt they caused others. They were just trying to find their way through life and find someone to spend that life with.For a first-time novelist, Laura Dave cranked out a good, light story about the intricacies of relationships and family bonds."
4,Engaging & with insight,"I listened to the CD on a road trip. As a single guy who doesn't read much chick lit and who didn't have any sisters, I found the book helped me to better understand and appreciate the other human species and reinforce some important lessons about making choices."
2,A Skimmer,"Are you 22? Are you agonizing over some post-frat dude who's done next to nothing to earn your obsessive attentions? If so, you'll be hooked by this book's lightweight story line, eye-roll-worthy plot ""twists"" and self-conscious dialogue.If you're a grownup, skip it."
2,"I wanted to like this book, but couldn't","After reading the glowing reviews, I wanted to like this book. Unfortunately, I didn't find it very likeable. It wasn't beautifully written, or funny, or deeply insightful (the book's message seems to be: you've got to make choices, and they must be realistic...what a surprise). I just wanted the twenty-somethings to grow up and stop being so self-absorbed."
2,I don't get it....,"I'm not quite sure what all the praise is about. I read ""The Divorce Party"" by Dave and loved it. This, I found highly disappointing. It starts with an unrealistic story line of breaking off your engagement to hide away in Rhode Island, where a young, pretty girl settles on working at a bate and tackle shop. Yes, she is supposed to be doing research for her documentary, but it's just not realistic. The relationship Emmy has with her brother is sort of sweet, but again, the story that unfolds is highly unbelievable. I have read some pretty cheesy chick lit books that at least I cared what happened in the end. This one, not so much. Just finished it really to see how bad it would end. Really disappointing."
5,Great Chick lit with substance,"Great chick lit but with some substance that makes you think about what's important in a relationship. This book was entertaining and made me introspective at the same time. Great read, Dave's a great story teller."
4,From USA to the world,"Gerard Schwarz and the Seatle Symphony's performance of Copland's Fanfare for the Common Man is one of the best that you can hear on these times: Solemn, moving and extremely beautiful. The voice of James Earl Jones in Lincoln Portrait is definitively pearless. This astonishing work, merging some music by Aaron Copland that flows from the very heart and soul of American people, and the quite deep words and thoughts of President Lincoln, are indeed a real gift from the USA to the entire mankind. The other works on this cd, composed by Copland himself and Roy Harris (wonderfuly played by the Seattle Symphony and Chorale) are truly superb."
3,JAMES EARL JONES DISAPPOINTS,"A Lincoln Portrait is a favorite of mine, but this one misses the mark. Schwartz's musical direction is excellent, but all goes out the window when James Earl Jones begins his orotund reading of the texts. Jones has, I fear, become a prisoner of people's expectations. He is EXPECTED to read this like Darth Vadar, and so he does, but it's completely the wrong approach. Lincoln's simple but powerful words are best with a simple reading. They don't need to become ""oratory"". Henry Fonda had the right idea when he read for this piece, and his rendition remains my favorite."
3,Moondance review by Brett...,"Hey there, this CD is soo old but is worth reviewing since I was listening to it the other day and realised how kewl it is. Definately worth a listen although oldskool, it brings back memories... Back then I'd have given it 5 stars without a doubt."
3,"Good, but..","I bought this dictionary, and found it quite handy. The vocabulary provided is quite complete, but the English-Welsh section is wanting in few respects. No idea is given about the pronunciation and basic grammar, which one may look for in a concise form in any dictionary. The compiler of this dictionary obviously presupposes that the reader may know it quite well. The gender of the Welsh nouns is not given there at the first place. That makes one hunt for the gender in the Welsh-English section, which takes a good deal of time, given the small size of the book. Nevertheless, it would be good for one, who is good in the grammar and pronunciation of the language, and for one who needs new words."
2,"Looks neat, but that's about it...","The controller looks awesome, and if all you wish it to be is an ornament, it will serve you well. However, for those of us who like to play with our controllers, this is below par. The buttons are shoddy, and the game rarely realizes you've hit anything. The joysticks are also crappy. Buy something else if you want a usable controller."
3,"Cool, but not to play...","is very cool, but to play suck, the stick's and pad is very painful (impossible to use in fight games)Es muy bonito el diseño y todo es genial, pero para jugar es pesimo, usar el pad y los analogos duele en los dedos (imposible para usar en algun juego de peleas)"
3,Not bad overview - but so very American centric,"Rather Disappointed - Its a good book if you want an overview of the technologies involved and a light read - but very USA focused - examples of technology deployment are all US as is the competitive environment. Regulatory environment discussion (including FCC-related Annex) covers 62 pages, 1 page of which is entitled ""the international scene"" and discusses the example of Pakistan and Netherlands! Lastly - management and billing of convergant network occupies <4pages in total."
4,Photography and computer graphics at its very best,"The photography and computer graphics will please the young and the older folks. I found it educational and a nice addition to our film library. However, the 75 running time is a bit deceptive. The main feature is only 30 minutes. Perhaps the extras make up the difference. Usually the running time doesn't include the extras.I highly recommend this to parents who want to educate and engage their children in the subject matter of first life on Earth. It's 30 minutes of pure visual entertainment splattered with good narrative information. Also, the sound track is quite interesting. It reminds me of the sound track from '2001' but, of course, very different. One of the extras is the sound track with visuals. There is also an education slide show and a short quiz at the end.All in all time well spent, and a dvd worth the money. But I do wish there had been more footage to the main feature."
5,Both rigorous and imaginative,"This volume makes it clear that Freitas has really thought things through. He is also an excellent writer; the introductory chapters on medicine and nanotechnology are exceedingly clear and informative. It's when he gets into the details, though, that the breadth and depth of his knowlege become apparent. It may be that things on the nanoscale are weirder and less cooperative than we currently imagine, but within the limits of what we know today, this book is authoritative.It might also be a broadening read for engineers and/or people in the medical field with no direct interest in nanotechnology per se, since it takes an engineering (rather than a traditionally anatomical) view of the human body."
5,NanoMedicine-It's Not Science Fiction any more!,"This is an extremely comprehensive and scholarly work (of which there are 2 more volumes)on the subject of nanotechnology, especially as it can be applied to medicine. It is not however, an easy read. I am nothing intellectually close to the audience that this is written for, yet I have an expanded understanding of not only current technology, but also what the possiblities are. For the curious jr. scientist, or the real deal, this is an amazing book that can begin your journey into what I believe is the next great wave of technology of the 21st century."
4,Cool but annoying,This gundam model is very fun and cool to look at overall. Overal this model took me about nine hours to build. I had trouble putting on both vulcan cannons so i just left them off. The articulation is very good especially with the wings which leads me to my next problem. I had trougle putting on the backpack on the gundam itself but eventually it got on. The wings are very well articulated but ofcoarse back heavy. I hade trouble with the left front wing because it kept leaning down slowly but eventualy it stayed and the right back wing kept on falling off for some reason but eventually it stayed. For some reason on my model the right arm doesent want to go all the way into where the shoulder is but im to lazy to fix it. Btw you have to adjust the twin buster rifles to hold in the hand correctly. Overall hes a very fun build and fun to look at wen its on the stand (it comes with a stand )
4,How to play short handed,"This book is a really good book on how to play short handed. Most poker books discuss how to play premium hands against large fields of players. This is a book about how to play sub premium hands in situations where isolation is possible; that is situations where the opponents are tight and unimaginative.The strategy involved is:1) Play cards that will do well against the opponent's likely hands (since the opponents are tight these are limited)2) Play in position so you end up heads up3) Make sure your little cards are seen by the opponents so that you get an ""always plays junk / always bluffs"" reputation and thus win big with your big hands that come in due to lose calling.4) Play defensively so that you are unlikely to be bluffed atThe book is certainly original enough to warrant picking up for $20. I wish it were longer and more detailed but the author does also have a tournament practice book."
5,small ball used to be called trash cards,"He will teach you many ""small ball"" ideas you may want to know. Also, you'll understand many concepts behind the ""any card can win"" players out there. It's hard to find any books covering ""small ball"" or ""any cards can win"" ideas. Well, here is one for you."
4,"Nice Album, See live you will be a bit disappointed","The album is top notch, however it does not due justice to band when you see them 'live'. I suppose you could say this about everything, but Band swings 'so hard' in person the CD does not get the adrenalyn going.Jeff Hamilton just kills you with his 'fills' and 'tightness' driving the band. John Clayton is a 'rock' too. Guess I am hoping for a 'live' recording some day.You must see them if you can."
4,Beautiful quality book,"This book turned out to be more beautiful and of a higher quality than I had anticipated. It was a gift but would make a great waiting area book. thick, glossy pages. I almost wish I'd ordered one for myself..."
3,Decent but not Impressive,"Over All Rating: CEarbud Sound: COverall Features: ADocumentation: DTech Support: FQuality: BI recently bought this MP3 Player because it had a great rebate deal that brought the cost way down. For the price I paid, I am happy with it. If I had paid the standard price, I would have been very disappointed. The good news is that it has some great features. I love the 1.5 Gig expandability and the FM Radio tuner, but I don't think it stands up to the quality you find from companies like Apple.Customer beware when it comes to Firmware upgrades. I downloaded the latest firmware from the Company's site after getting the product. The ""latest"" firmware on the site was older than what came with the player and when I tried to load it on the MP3 player, it turned out to be incompatible too. The player went dead and it took me a good 3 days to figure out how to get it to reload the original firmware again."
2,Warning - no resume feature,"This unit does not have a resume feature, which is a must if you use this for spoken-word audio. Other MP3 players from Ultra Products are having their firmware upgraded, and will correct this shortcoming, but Ultra Products has not committed to upgrading the firmware for this unit."
2,Not Gigi's best,"Gigi Leung is the big female star here and she's known mostly as a singer in Hong Kong and the Pacific Rim area. She's gorgeous but has a reputation of being a wooden actress. She's getting better but La Brassiere is not her best role. The humor is typical for most modern Hong Kong films, bawdy, tasteless, broad and -- as one reviewer has already stated -- very similar to Benny Hill. It's just not done as well as Benny Hill did it. You can watch it to watch Gigi, there's much worse things to do than that. Karen Mok appears for a few minutes in a completely nonsensical role. That was a waste of her time. Hope she got paid well for it. Lau Ching Wan is always funny...except this time. Louis Koo is on hand for the ladies but you'll have more fun watching him in Why Me Sweetie. This is for Hong Kong film aficianados and Louis and Gigi fans only."
4,Excellent,"Very fast shipping, and the VHS was well wrapped and protected.The box was a little bit damaged (it was a used video)."
4,This was a great read,"After experiencing several bouts with depression throughout my 30s--I am now 38 and the daily battle continues, this book caught my attention from another message board. I checked it out from my local library and finished it within 2 days. I could so relate to the author. Her story was very poignant and I appreciated her honesty. While medication has not worked for me I am trying a daily balance of selfcare to work with my depression. This is a book I will buy. Continued success to the author, her family and circle of friends."
5,Great Read!,I received the item on time actually it was earlier than anticipated and I was happy! This is a great book!
4,Depression does not discriminate,"I'm not giving a review I'm just voicing my opinion and concern, please don't get defensive, but all nationalities suffer from this illness; oh by the way, I'm African American, Black American etc. (which everyone is politically correct, you can use it) the point is, we all need help in realizing we are not alone with this illness that seems to break our spirit and leave us so hopeless.I'm sure this book is fabulous and I congratulate Ms. Meri Nana-Ama Danquah for sharing her story with all of us - exposing your vulnerability to anyone is not easy to do. We need to know we're not alone.God Bless & Thank you."
2,This edition is not a full survey,"ISBN# 0-13-019729-7 is for volume 1 which only covers ""Prehistoric Through Gothic Art""... very disappointing considering I ordered this book under the assumption that it went up through the postmodern period"
4,Hardys and computers collide - excellent.,This is a good fast-paced kidnap mystery. It's great for kids.
4,Good Book,I bought this for my Dad who loves political books from both sides of the aisle. He gave it his stamp of approval.
2,Not what is Needed,"It's hard to write an unbiased book on such a political topic, but regardless, ""The Bushes"" is so pro-Bush, that it hardly differs from the other pro- or anti-Bush books coming out these days. Will somebody please just forget personal politics, forget personal biases, and write a book that's neither condemning nor adulating?"
5,One of the best sources for information on gambling scams,"Gambling Scams is really an encyclopedic description of gambling scams, from con men to cheating at dice games and card cheating in private games. The author's repute, experience and skills in card and dice manipulation are unquestioned. Darwin Ortiz is truly providing worthwile information to protect oneself from gambling scams from the ""inside"". Thus, the correctness of his publication is undoubted. I highly recommend this publication to anyone wishing to protect themselves from dishonest gamers or those with a particular interest in gambling scams in general. If you're thinking of buying the book to learn card manipulation then perhaps you should look elsewhere for more descriptive explanations of particular ""moves"", such as ""The Expert at the Card Table,"" by S.W. Erdnase, a classic which describes numerous manipulations, in minutia."
1,Bummer,This does not come with vocal tracks or lyrics even though it says that it does. Very difficult to use without those.
2,Unbelievably bad,"I thought that this book would be twisted and disturbing. And I thought that Ian McEwan's writing would be flawless and flow wonderfully, considering all the accolades he's gotten, but I was extremely disappointed. The story line was too unfeasible and didn't make sense logistically. The characters weren't developed enough and it seemed like a rough sketch of a book, rather than a finished product."
2,Not so great,"Like another reviewer, I only finished this because it was so short. I found the characters (especially the two sisters) flat and uninteresting. Everyone keeps talking about the shocking final scene, but it just struck me as ridiculous. You can't just throw some incest in there and expect everyone to be shocked into liking the book. Apparently he can, though; everyone else seemed to enjoy this less-than-enjoyable mess. I just finished the story, bored and totally unimpressed, 5 minutes ago, and I figured I'd better write the review now or I'd forget all about it by morning.A way to fill up a couple of hours, but nothing more."
1,Disturbing,I bought this book because it was cheap. I wish I had saved my money. I was able to finish the book because I like to finish what I start but I found it very disturbing. I am not sure why incest had to be part of the story. It did not seem to really fit. This is definitely not an author nor a book I would recommend to anyone.
2,Too Noir,I was a bit disappointed in this short novel. Too much of a reminder of Flowers in the Attic and not the type of novella I am very interested in
3,"Okay, not his best work","I love Ian McEwan, but was disappointed by this one. It was good, and held me to the end, but again, just not his best."
2,Not my style of garden,"Thought this might have been a mystery. Slow start and and no direction, kept reading to find a point of focus. Must have been male teenage angst but still a mystery to me."
4,Confronting,"Though it lacks the confident mastery of his more recent work, this early McEwan novel still has the power to disturb. When the parents of four sexually precocious children die in quick succession - the mother's corpse being entombed in a concrete block in the basement in order to stop the family being splintered by the authorities - the children must learn to cope on their own. In lesser hands this could have been worked up into a straightforward monster-in-the-basement-style thriller, but with McEwan at the helm it more interestingly becomes a study in grief, repression, adolescence, and the dissolution of the family in late twentieth-century Britain."
3,"Disturbing, But Not Much More","This book means many things to many different people. Some people think that its incestuously beautiful, while other people are sickened by it. My reaction was neither of these. When i got done reading it, I just thought, so what?Its a slightly unsettling story and is somewhat interesting. The incest between the brother and sister at the end of the book is not unexpected. Sure, it is slightly disturbing, but not much more than that. It wants to be the symbolic shocker that The Lord of the Flies is, but it just doesn't have the depth to carry it off.If you're on a long plane ride, or just really bored and looking for something to read, then I recommend this book. But if you're looking for something deeply meaningful and fascinating, take a pass on this dull affair of a book."
5,The Real Family?,I read this book as a comparison to 'Death of a Salesman' in my A'level english course. I found the book was extremly well written and brought out the surpressed feeling that we have. The way that the characters develope in to the 'family' life becomes all to real with Julie and Jack being 'husband and wife'. I felt that this book was interesting to an outsider who has never been in that prediciment.
4,I saw the movie first,"And the movie is one of my all time favorites. The cinematography is wonderful, and the story is deeply disturbing. I read the book and found that I didn't get as much out of it as I did the movie. I think the movie shows us how four kids set to making a family to replace the one that fell apart in a very short period of time. The tone of the book did not shed this kind of light on the story. The book seemed to be more about the boy and his world, which is more lecherous, seedy, and selfish. The movie shows us how the oldest girl is trying to keep things together and at the same time trying to enjoy her young adulthood (the sunbathing and the boyfriend with the fancy sportscar). I did not get as much insight from the book, although I think it's important to read it as well as watch the movie."
3,not his best,"An entertaining and well-written novel with an unusual theme, which could be described as both unique and slight. It goes nowhere although the ride has its moments."
3,100 Words or Less,"I'm a huge McEwan fan, but this book dips too far into his deep well of sadness that usually makes up his plots/characters. Without the beautiful prose of other works (""Atonement"" is a perfect example), what's left is a dysfunctional family with nothing but despair. In the end ... well, I don't know how it ends. Without actually deciding, I put the book aside and never picked it up again. I suppose I made it halfway through? Simply too depressing with little hope of getting better. But hey, if you need that sort of thing, this is on target."
3,Would make a great book club discussion subject,"Long before he penned his more popular ""Atonement"" and ""Saturday"", Ian McEwan offered up this creepy little tale of four young children orphaned and alone, living out a fantasy of lurid behaviors - or natural ones. Is it The Garden of Eden? Or is it the sexual fantasy of the 15-year-old protagonist? Not my favorite book, but one which will haunt me for a while. It would make a GREAT book club discussion subject."
3,interesting reading,Held my interest but was a little disturbing content-still well-written and enjoyable. Gave me things to think about afterwards.
2,"Not something I would recommend, but couldn't hurt to read.","I initially chose to read McEwan because I had an assignment in my english class. I then chose The Cement Garden because it seemed like a quick read and the reviews were positive. I'm not going to dam the book, but it was boring. Plain and simple. The whole incest thing was disgusting, and I don't care about exploring anything. If a writer is going to talk about it, at least make it sophisticated.Sorry to those who enjoyed it.Hope this helps!"
1,unimpressed,"I agree with the reviewer that called this book ""juvenile and tasteless"". It is a poor man's Lord of the Flies, for sure. It seemed like nothing more than a sick indulgence on the author's part. The characters seemed totally unreal, particularly the older sister, and the ending was pure gothic fantasy. I loved Atonement, so obviously Ian McEwan made some headway after this misguided project. I guess we all have to start somewhere."
1,EWWWW!!!!!!,I can't even begin to put this book into a category...I will say that this is in no way a pleasurable read. I didn't find it haunting or even bothersome; annoying and tasteless is more of an apt description. It was predictable and plodding as well. The only reason I finished it was because it was short and I have a neurotic tendancy to finish what I start. So glad I got it out of the library & didn't spend my $ on it.Not recommended.
2,Puzzled,"I am an enormous fan of Ian McEwan, so I am puzzled that an author of his stature and with his abililty to captivate his readers could have written this book. The subject matter is disturbing on so many levels. I read as much as I could without finding anything redeeming in content or characterization. Could this be the same author who wrote On Chesil Beach and Atonement?"
3,and the point of the story is?,"I don't know. Yes, i could speculate on what the author was trying to express, but in the end nothing i imagine makes the story more fulfilling. Also, for me, the characters just seem to be and change without any motivating factor. Still, because of his subsequant achievements and writing skills, if you are a fan of Mr. McEwan you will enjoy digging through this story in search of the origins of the things to come.If, on the other hand, you are not familiar with Mr. McEwan's work i think you would be better served reading one of his more accomplished and refined books."
2,deja vu?,"This novel reads like a perverted retelling of and expansion on Julian Gloag's Our Mother's House (1963), which was disturbing enough on its own. Both novels were critically well-regarded in their times, and both are/were skillfully written and highly upsetting. Has McEwan ever commented on Gloag's fiction?"
3,Eerie and gripping but also dull at times,"This is one of McEwan's early novels. As usual, there is something about the story that hooks the reader. The narrator is a 15 year old boy who has experienced the recent death of both his parents. He is now living with his 2 sisters and younger brother. The relationship among the siblings is - lets just say different as I do not want to reveal any surprises in the book.McEwan writing is fine, as usual, but at times choppy. For example, there are major scene changes without an appropriate transition. Plot is certainly interesting. It is a very short book so it is hard to say it dragged on but I was bored at times. Overall, McEwan fans will not be disappointed, but for me (I am not a big fan but I do appreciate his style), I think I will take a long break from his books."
3,a dark story but a compelling read,"reading this book was like driving past a car crash , you don't want to look , afraid of what you might see but you look anyway. the glimpses are occasionally grotesque... actually entirely grotesque.. unless you count the descriptions of julies sun worship and athletic body putting some light into the darkness.ok the good news: its short, written in a straightforward way, good ambiance and mood, strong imagery and a thrilling read, those that like reading of a persons thoughts and feelings rather then straight narrative/dialogue will like the stylethe bad news: we only get the boys perspective of his mothers death - i would have liked some character development of the sisters - as for derek, the only point of his presence was to upset the household, more could have been done with this character. Still, if you like your novels on the dark side this one is definately for you."
4,Engaging read,"I have read many Ian McEwan books and found this one to be an engaging page turner. Although dealing with a fairly dark subject matter, this is what kept it interesting! The story follows 4 brother and sisters as they deal with the death of their mother. When left alone without any outside support or care, what would happen to them? A great concept and I was engaged to the end, I just wish the book was a bit longer."
1,"Renaissance -12, Women's brown suead shoes",Recomend ordering atleast 1/2 size to a full size larger. Straps tend to make it hard to get the foot in and under the strain of trying to put it on can break. No problem shoe still looks good if you cut the straps of.
3,"Decent shoes, wish they could grip better","Pros:* Looks very niceCons:* My shoe size is 14 so I ordered the X-Large 14-15 size. It's loose on my foot and now I know I should order one size down since these tend to run a little big.* The bottom has no sole grip whatsoever. You will slide in these for sure.* The material scuffs very easily. Random black marks from the shoe just dropping.These shoes are good for people who like to slide around, but they're not as great as I thought they would be."
5,way too pimpin,these kicks are way too pimp to review. buy them and reap the benefits of fancy ladies and expensive creams and lotions...
4,Worth it,"I only use the AM, but its definitely worth it. Agree with other folks you need to be on it for a few weeks to feel the difference. Going off of it returns within days. Great choice, wish it was available as AM only, but worth it as is."
4,works for me,"The hot flashes are not gone completely, but I have less and they are very mild.The pm pill keeps me awake so I only take the am pill. Still worth buying."
5,Answer to prayer!,Put an end to the hot flashes. I'm more energetic and I have better attitude when I take the Enzymatic Therapy as directed. Very pleased!!
5,This formula saved me,"I started this out of desperation when night sweats/hot flashes kept me awake almost all night. I also had hot flashes followed by cold flashes complete with teeth chattering chills during the day. When I started the am/pm formula, it took about 3-4 weeks before it reached maximum effectiveness. But after that, I had NO MORE NIGHT SWEAT/SLEEPLESS NIGHTS! All cold flashes ceased, and I have only had maybe a handful of slightly warm episodes since. It helped me sleep and to be awake during the day, all without hot flashes. I can't say enough good about the relief it provides. Try it, it might work for you, too."
5,They're not Hot Flashes... They're POWER SURGES!,"Love it, Love it, LOVE IT! I bought this at a local health food store yesterday (for a whopping $23.95!!!! Needless to say, I'll be buying them from Amazon from now on, but I digress...) I literally took my first pill last night and for the first time in YEARS I didn't wake up in the middle of the night soaked. I haven't had a hot flash/power surge in years but the blasted night sweats haven't dwindled in the least.... At least, not until last night... I had the BEST night's sleep! I still woke up for my nightly ""constitutional"" but fell right back to sleep and not a drop of sweat, not even warm!! As a matter of fact, I was *almost* chilly! Took the first Day pill today and honestly didn't really notice any difference but I'm a pretty even tempered and good humored person for the most part."
1,Not Working...Yet,"This product was recommended to me by a natural foods store. I've been taking it for about 3 weeks and my hot flashes are just as persistent as ever -- 3-4 times a night in which I wake up unbearably hot and sweaty, and intermittently throughout the day. The packages suggests it may take 5-6 weeks to work, so I'm going to finish up the package but I'm less than hopeful. Also, I'm going to add 400 iu Vitamin E to my regimen; some research suggests this will help. Happy hot flashing!"
1,The author has written a review of his own book - how lame,"I mostly liked this author before, but it *seems* that this author has taken to writing ""Customer Reviews"" of his/her? own works! That's pretty darn lame. He/she should at least acknowledge their status as author in the review, if they had any integrity."
4,Volcanic music!,"Danielpour's syncopated rhythms are right out of Stravinsky's Rite, his orchestral colours fiery as the Firebird - but there is nevertheless a personality in this music that lifts it above mere pastiche. Alternating a volcanic energy that takes Stravinsky's wildest moments to an entirely different level with deeply moving moments that recall Debussy or the early, tonal work of Schoenberg, this music speaks to both the physical and spiritual aspects of the listener."
2,Typically overheated Manara item,"Milo Manara--a draftsman beyond technical reproach, and one who loves to draw anything to do with heterosexual anal sex. So, inevitably, this, known unsurprisingly as FATAL RENDEZVOUS in its US edition from Heavy Metal--a remarkably clumsy story about a woman being anally raped, on a daily basis. This isn't really a spoiler, it's frankly the selling point, as well as very nearly the starting point. Manara's bootless nihilism comes into play, but, well, it IS well-drawn, no two ways about it."
2,World vision gained.,"I enjoyed the true life story of Mike and the battle of his family with their hidden ememy. He continued to fight back and remained as positive as can be, each time that failing vision kicked him down he would get back up. The book also contained a very insightful look into the daily operations of the Massachusetts Commission for the Blind. An agency who can do so much more for those that they serve. I would have love to learn more about the other family members such as his sisters who while not vision impared still paid a price. Do they have the ""Gene"" and will it pass down to their male children? In addition how are the other four brothers doing? Mike, we need you to continue on with the story!!! Get off the 12th floor and start writting."
2,This Game is Terrible!,"While this game may be fun for small children (it's verycartoonish)it is incredibly boring for anyone over 7. You just sitaround waiting for things to be built, the game is rather confusing with very little documentation, and it's just nowhere near as good as other games in this genre. I HIGHLY recommend Caesar III or Pharaoh if you want a fun, challenging, and well historically-researched game END"
2,A little junky,"Returned this bag, it looks very plain and junky. I'm sure it would be fine for functional use, but if you've graduated beyond using zip lock bags for your toiletries, why not get something nicer?"
4,"Great product, BAD shipping",These are great...If you get one that arrives undamaged. I got these for my clinic and they all arrived damaged in some way. We finally got one complete by taking the bottom from one and putting the top from the other one.
5,Marimba at it's best,"One of the greatest muscians alive, Leigh Howard Stevens has taken the marimba to new heights with his incredible style and abilities. Marimba When is a favorite among many marimbist and I do hope that amazon restocks this fantastic cd. If you are looking for a great cd, this one doesn't dissapoint."
3,Quarter-hour missing,"With further development of the role John Travolata portrays, MAD CITY could have been unforgettable instead of just entertaining. It appears as if maybe 15 to 30 minutes' worth of information on Travolta's hostage-taking security guard was cut. Nonetheless, the actor makes you care about his character even as he holds women and children at gunpoint, pretty impressive. But if we understood him better, the former Gabe Kaplan nemesis could have done a great job in a great film instead of just a good film. But see MAD CITY for the entertainment value and because movies such as this do not get made often enough."
1,oh god...,"Are you kidding me? This movie is pathetic. I wish i could give it less than one star, but amazon is being generous. I've tried to watch this movie 3 times, never getting through the movie, always turning it off in disgust."
4,"Hoffman is breathtaking, everything else is predictable.",The Movie is entertaining and the acting is quite good especially by Dustin Hoffman. It is worth seeing once or twice.
3,Another one of Travolta's flops,"Ever since winning a Best Actor Oscar for his role in 1994's PULP FICTION,John Travolta was relentlessly,to this day,making films. This one,was his first post-PF flop. His previous flops include PERFECT,TWO OF A KIND,SHOUT and THE EXPERTS. This film was theatrically released on November 7,1997 and released on video on February 24,1998. In this film,Travolta is a former security guard who takes museum patrons hostage,very similar to what Tim Robbins did in 1990's CADILLAC MAN. Max Brackett(Dustin Hoffman) is a news reporter who covers the situation. Great support from Alan Alda. Travolta's follow-up film PRIMARY COLORS was much more successful than this. Despite the critical and box office disappointment,some of Travolta's fans loved this one."
1,Gypped!,"I feel gypped! I bought this CD for the final prisoner song which played during the credits. Surprise -- no such song. What happened? When I pay for an original motion picture soundtrack, that's what I expect to get; not an abbreviated version of the score. Please gimme my money back."
1,Saw it three times...,"...because the first two times I watched it, I fell asleep. (I rarely do this during movies.) Travolta is way out of his league with his role as a nave security guard. He gives off such a ""Look at me! I'm ACTING!"" vibe, it's impossible to maintain suspension of disbelief. The movie progresses at a snail's pace. Alan Alda as usual convincingly plays a jerk. If you want to see an out-of-control media really fouling things up, check out ""Tomorrow Never Dies."""
4,"It's a mad, mad, mad world","This satirical movie starts innocently enough, with Dustin Hoffman (Max Brackett) doing a ""controversial"" story on a local criminal. Brackett has been relegated to small-town duty after embarassing the network star, Kevin Hollander (played brilliantly by Alan Alda). Sam Baily (Travolta) has been fired after working as a guard at a museum. He lives paycheck to paycheck and has a family to support.To get his boss to listen to him, he makes the decision to take a gun with him to capture her attention...a gun and a bag full of dynamite. The movie is wonderful, not for the twists and turns, but for the performances and nuances. A number of times, Brackett could take a risk and end the situation, a situation he basically created himself out of his own greed. In the end, this movie has great commentary on how the media goes overboard in its coverage. This movie may be more relevant today than when it was made."
4,A 'Dog Day Afternoon' At The Museum,"Man, this was some indictment of the television-reporter-mentality! It was exaggerated, of course, but still interesting to see and in many respects good to see because of the onslaught of ""tabloid journalism"" that seems to have taken over the media in recent years.Whatever, you can enjoy this film for the acting alone with Dustin Hoffman, John Travolta, Alan Alda, Robert Prosky, Mia Kirschner and Ted Levine. These actors, and some good dialog, make the film move along at a good clip despite the absence of much happening on screen.The story gets you involved and reminds me of the famous 70s film, ""Dog Day Afternoon,"" in which much of the film takes place in a bank. Here, it's a museum, and a man is in a predicament something like Al Pacino was in that film except Travolta's character here is totally innocent.The screenwriters added bit of humor to this involving story and that made it even better. It's very good entertainment and certainly recommended."
4,A Good Time,"Whispers In the Wind was a nice little story. At first when I started to read, I wasn't too sure that I would like this book. Once I got into it a little more I found myself enjoying it! This is just a fun book, not too serious and a fantasy indeed. Fun day of reading is how I would describe this book. I liked the characters and wish we would have known alittle more about Elizabeth's new life. I was glad to turn the page and see this book through...don't give up on it!"
3,earthy delights,"This blurb from the back cover: 'Rosemary Maddox is TV's most popular gardening presenter. Her career and business are going brilliantly but her sex life is unpredictable. Someone is making dirty phonecalls and sending her strange objects in the post, including a doll that resembles her dressed in kinky clothes.'Sounds to me like the setup for a perfectly diabolical story, but I think the author totally misses the chance for a really good sexual thriller. The main character has sex with everybody from the studly gardening assistant to the police officer hired to protect her. The alluded-to suspense never really gets off the ground leaving this reader a bit disappointed.The story is set in England, the author is British, and the book is rife with 'British-isms' not always familiar to the North American Market. The sex is hot and if you're looking for something with page after page of steam, this will work for you."
2,Very weak,"I'm a huge fan of Rollin, but this one just didn't cut it for me. It was just too flat. The pacing that he is noted for just wasn't there; there was none of the tension or excitement which always kept me on edge while watching his earlier movies.It also seemed that there was too much dialogue. Most of Rollin's films feature action and suspense with sparse talking. Even the sex and nudity, which is usually awesome, was no big deal. And, I wish we could have seen more of Celine Mauge, the cute, but daffy nun, who always had the yellow ball and paddle with here.I'd recommend Requiem for a Vampire, Living Dead Girl, Lips of Blood, Fascination, and even Killing Car if you want to see Rollin in his prime."
1,Jean Rollin misses the mark,"Rollin is as confused as ever, only his earlier stuff is saved by stunning if quirky visuals.If you know Rollin, then you'll know that this film is unlikely to make sense. If you like Rollin, you probably won't enjoy this.An odd assortment of evil characters come together at a sea-side castle (Rollin's favourite haunt) to see a woman from a convent become mistress to Dracula. When I say odd assortment, we'll we've got a dwarf, a vampire, an ogre (she's not much different from the vampire), and a few servants of darkness.Give this a miss"
3,Very disappointed.,"I do not like the format! The book is about the size of a CD and for a reference book this makes the print way too small. There are lots of typos. Release dates pending for albums that have been out for years. For a book that they've had so much time to work on it looks as if it was rushed to print. Maybe they should have looked at the last edition. The only thing good I can say is that I like the color pictures and the new additions, ie. Anthologies and Capitol CD's."
5,I REMEMBER THE DAYS!,"This is the group that totally possessed my homeland back in The Philippines. Anyway, this is a must have if you want to listen to some real unknown ""New Wave"" hits back in the days. Of course, you've got Whatever Possessed You here and Boyish Days. If you need some education on what the real New Wave British sound is, then this Cd is a good way to start your learning. Pick this CD up and prepare to visit the different side of the 80s"
2,Not a book... just a booklet,"This is really not a book. It is a small booklet that has some good information, but is generally a rehash of what we already can read elsewhere. I recommend a 'pass' on this one."
2,small town veneer,"Yes, you have some superficial sense that these gals have rubbed shoulders & other body parts with small town & semi-rural life...with pictures of farm animals...and hanging out @ not too busy streets & thoroughfares. But there's still an urban, we've been there & done that feel from women who routinely visit sex shops and also from their all-too-knowing demeanors about sexual escapades and their down & dirty dancing. However, a few gals I really liked..that had girl-next-door looks & style. Guys: you're far better off not getting the video and looking for a real down-the-earth & special honey who is very inexperienced sexually but who has it together otherwise."
5,Best book I've bought for our family so far,"I really, really love this book -- and so do my two girls, ages 4 and 6. There aren't pictures, so I wasn't sure how my 4 year old would respond, as she usually has very little patience for stories without pictures . . . but she LOVES these stories. They're short, simple, and yet so compelling.I was searching for a beautiful, hard-cover story book with stories about all of the holidays people around the world of all religions are celebrating during what we would call the ""Christmas season"". I still haven't found that book. . . But I stumbled upon this one and am so glad that I ordered it! I am sure that it will be loved and read in our house for a very long time!"
1,This is a custom DJ mix from Vinyl.,"The description of the item didn't state that this was a continuous playing cd. Also, the description didn't state that this was a DJ mix from vinyl. If you are expecting seperate songs, do not buy this CD. Lastly, the Magician all of sudden has the tempo sped up about a minute into the song. This purchanse was extremely disapponting."
2,Puffin edition not so hot,"These stories, fantastic. 12 stars. But this Puffin edition is paperback sized, with Michael Foreman's gorgeous watercolors reduced to dingy postage stamps.Do yourself and your kid a favor, and get the big color version. They'll be enticed by the pictures, and will be better able to read themselves with the bigger type."
3,Sizes run large,Bought this as a 2x but turns out to be a 3x. Washing and drying several times has not shrunk it yet.
2,History's Great Howler,"A scholarly but extremely dull book that contains history's great howler. On page 61, after tracing the descent of Matilda, Henry I's first wife, from the Saxon kings, the book insanely attributes the whole line of English kings to Henry I's second wife. As stated in Thomas R. Moore's book, ""Plantagenet Descent: 31 Generations from William the Conqueror to Today,"" : ""King Henry I had long been in love with Matilda ... great-granddaughter of the great English hero King Edmund Ironside. He proposed. The English were delighted. ... His example was followed by others, and intermarriages between Normans and English became common. ... His efforts were so successful that he has been called the refounder of the English nation. He did his part by fathering 25 illegitimate children. ... [Henry's] second wife ... proved barren. ... Ironically, after Henry's death she remarried and had seven children."" pages 14-15."
1,Not Worth The Time or Money,"I have all the Quiller books now, and have read them all several times.This one is a stinker, and reads more like an outline for a novella than a finished work. That's because it is an unfinished work, as you know if you've read a bit about it here. Reading it will also tell you more about how Trevor/Hall composed his books, and this will not lead to you enjoying them more. I tried to read another one and the magic was gone, I could see the author's methods and once you see that, unless they are a great writer, the jig is up and the pleasure is gone.Skip it, and reread an earlier novel. Do not pay money for this parody of a Quiller book."
4,Wham Bam Thank you DC man,"Too Hard? Too Choppy? Too much BS. This game is one of the most challenging Wrestling games I have ever tried. Although it takes more than the average gamesrs 50 I.Q. it is the most strategic wrestling game I have ever played. Yes, I like the engine of WWF Wrestlemania 2000, but that game has major flaws also.....it is too easy to use the same moves on your buddies and win almost all the time. I LIKE THIS GAME. IT IS CHALLENGING AND FULL OF DEPTH."
1,Let's Grapple for 10 minutes and do nothing!,"WWF Attitude has the worst hit detection I've seen in a long while. It's also incredibly difficult to do any sort of move besides the grapple and turn the opponents elbow move. I played with a friend for about 20 minutes, and all we were able to do was stand in the middle of the ring trying to twist each others elbows off. This ones a real stinker."
2,Not Good,"I'm a big WWF fan, and also a Dreamcast owner. When I popped this into my DC, my only reaction was ""Dammit, this sucks!"" Before I even get into the graphics (yuck), let me first state that the roster of wrestlers is only accurate as of November 1998. Absent are Y2J, Dudleys, Big Show, Rikishi, and Tazz; present are Goldust and Dr. Death - Enough said. To explain the graphics is a tough one - just picture the PlayStation version with anti-aliased effects and rope texture. Other changes are limited to slightly better sound and a marginally enhanced resolution setting. The control and collison detection are also still terrible. I see no reason anyone would want to pick up this game, as it's a rushed port with an outdated roster and graphics that didn't even do the PSX justice. Even if you're a DC owner in need of a WWF game, don't get it - wait for THQ's forthcoming WWF offering."
1,WWF Disappointment,This game is probably the biggest disappointment I've ever had with a video game. The game is exactly like the PSX version which was also horrible. The moves are very difficult to get off. You can't sit around with friends who haven't played it and have them enjoy it because its that difficult. Finishing moves are impossible. The graphics for the Dreamcast level are subpar. I'm glad thq is doing the next WWF game. Hopefully they will make one for Dreamcast because this one doesn't cut it. I traded mine in for 20 bucks a week after i bought. Pass on this one.
3,It's Pretty Decent,"If your expecting good graphics, then your in for a treat. If your expecting good gameplay, then go play the N64 version. Although the graphics are dreamcast expectable, the gameplay cannot match up to the other versions released for N64 and other systems. If you are a die hard wrestling fan, you will be somewhat pleased, but, since the moves are somewhat complicated, if you are not GungHo wrestling, you will not enjoy this game to much. It is much more complicated then the N64 version."
1,WWF Attitude...ick!,"When I got this game , I was hoping it was going to be great . I open it ..pop the cd in...cool opening video...then we get to the game...IT IS Terrible! The graphics are BAD its just not worthy of sitting with the other dreamcast games..! Its just sad...I dont recomend this to ANYONE...Its too late for me to get my money back...but dont waste yours ! My friends over to play it also agreed...so its more than one opinion in this review..."
2,Pe-yew!,"The hit detection is awful, the graphics would be mediocre even if they were on playstaion, and the controls are impossible. It takes like a ten button combo to pull off the simplist moves.The only thing that saves the game from being one star is that the create-a-wrestler option is fun. I found myself making wrestlers and not even wanting to use them. This game is bad. bad, bad, bad."
3,THIS IS A WRESTLING GAME!,"This game is one of the most complete WWFgames out their today! It has lots of match modes like triple threat,one on one,tag team,cage,etc. Including a career match. Its kind of like a season were you pick one good wrestler to fight for you for a series of months. You have diffrent match types during that strech. As you win your ranking gets higher on diffrent levels. The more you win the matches get higher and higher. If you win all your mathes you get speacial attributes like cloths, wrestlers ,etc."
4,Good product,This treat is perfect for my dachshunds. They love them and they aren't fatty. The only problem I have with them is that they are a little pricy.
2,Not so great once you open it,"If you have any appreciation for photography, don't buy this calendar. Print quality is poor and the photography is not spectacular by any means."
5,"A good, practical guide",I found this book very informative and practical. I particularly liked the emphasis on using your head and not making silly decisions because of all the hype.Lots of good information throughout.
5,A succint introduction to Y2K which is easy and enjoyable,"Found the book or manual of hints on how to treat a variety of possible problems with Y2K. Not too wordy and technical that it becomes boring and loses sight of its audience and objectives which are to give hints and tell the novice of possible ways to look at these problems. Informative ""Time Outs"" which whet the appetite."
2,Electronic supermodel,"As the title says, electronic supermodel. Most guys wish they had a supermodel for a girlfriend or wife. Believe me, you dont. They are tempermental, cranky, usually dont work well with others and oh yeah, ...THEY LOOK REAL GOOD.All of the above applies to this headset. >:-(At least real super models dont break body parts as easily,""Ellis"""
5,A beautiful read,"This is actually the first of Bear's works, though published as a unit much later. It is essentially a work of fantasy, but written with the underpinnings and attention to detail and consistency only a true hard-SF author would give attention to. If you've ever wondered if faeries were real, or if a myth really were true, what would the world be like, this book is for you. He treats these ideas seriously without taking himself too seriously. It -is- a long book, but you will feel enriched for reading it. A very personal afterword by the author is quite endearing and makes the novel even more enjoyable after the fact. Get the book, take your time, and read it. This is a book to be savored."
2,A very dull read,"This book came highly recommended but I feel it was a disappointment. It is long winded, dull, confusing and never really picks up. There are some good fantasy world ideas but has a Tolkien-esque never ending slow pace. Very blah and a waste of time."
5,It's Still That Good.,"I've read 'most all of the lauded fantasy fiction that's been written since the Songs, and despite the excellence of the George RR Martins, Steven Ericsons, Steven Brusts, Glen Cooks and Patrick Rothfusses (sp???)this still stands as a unique, powerful fantasy that is undiminished and unshadowed by time or competition. The moods range from bleak to beautiful, while over all is a sense of pervasive strangeness.As other reviewers have said, that makes Songs different from the standard fantasies, with their central casting heroes, heroines,arcane artifacts and Terrible Awful Things; this one stands yet with the few great ones."
4,A great book on the border of fantasy and sci-fi,"The only book I have read of Bears, this 2 part book is quite different from the normal fantasy range. By setting some of it in this world Bear has added a surreal, almost twighlight zone kind of feel to it, towards the end. good, but not too memorable characters, are mixed with a diverse and interesting world, making this an extremely enjoyable two-part novel. I personally like the first half a lot better then the second half and, even though I didn't think the second half was exactly bad, I could have easily stopped halfway."
2,Silly and scary and superficial,"This may be a good book for someone who has a sudden but mild problem with a cat, and has tried everything else, or a fun read if you're in a silly mood. Perhaps some would be entertained by the thought that it's psychologically damaging to call your spayed cat an ""it"", that cats relax best to New Age music, and to consider a second cat the first one's pet. However, some of the medical advice is scary, like suggesting you drug your cat with Valium, or even giving her chamomile (cats can be allergic to that, too).I would hope a new cat owner would look elsewhere for advice, especially introducing a new cat to your other cats. The SPCA as well as others will give free advice, and your own vet, preferably one who treats cats only, should know enough about behavior and modern medical techniques to answer any questions."
2,Disappointing,"I was disappointed with this book because I expected more substance on how to cure cat behavioral problems. Most of what was presented in the book was common sense. The book also doesn't offer any in-depth case histories and therapy plans for cats with particular problems.I feel this book would be useful for someone who knows little about cats. However, if you are familar with cats and their basic needs, this book doesn't offer much more insight than most people would know. I expected more from a well-known behaviorist.If you are really looking for an in-depth book on pet behavior that is more useful, read Pam Johnson-Bennett's ""Psycho Kitty"" book. I found it to be absolutely excellent."
5,So helpful,"I've never loved a cat before. My two dogs and I were bemused when a stray cat started following us around on our walks, eventually darting right ahead of us as we returned home, to be the first one in the door. Fortunately a friend gave me a copy of ""The Total Cat"" by Carole Wilbourn. My basic questions about feeding, litter box, and vet vists were answered briskly and sensibly. Then it got complicated when a second cat decided to move in. Carole's book walked me so carefully through the psychology of bringing the new cat into our family that it was painless. I turn to this book whenever a new catly situation arises and it hasn't let me down. Carole Wilbourn is either part feline herself, or has been a cat in a past life! Great book."
3,A common sense book,Because this is basically a common sense book I didn't find it helpful in dealing with my new kitten who is extremely loving and very curious. Her curiosity leads her to places where she should not go;n the author of this book tells me to put things away I don't want the cat to get into. To me this is not exactly the advice of an expert. I expected to learn how to teach a cat. The book does do what the title states; it does not do what I wanted. My mistake.
2,just stick to plain Java?,"In 99 when this product came out, Microsoft had high hopes about pushing their variant of Java. During the intervening years, J++ has been largely deprecated in the marketplace. You would be wasting your time learning this product. Instead just try going to the Sun Java website and downloading the latest official Java. You can easily find one that runs under MS Windows.Also, this helps all of the Java user base stay with a unified Java, rather than fragmenting into awkwardly [in]compatible camps."
2,Not that great!,"I bought these pills to help me lose baby weight. When I read the information inside the box on how to take these pills I realized that Green Tea Diet Pills were a joke. The info said to take the pills three times a day (hard to remember right before my meal), eat a 1500 calorie diet and exercise for 45 minutes/6 days a week. Based on the information, I was wondering why take the pills? Anyone can lose weight on 1500 calories a day without exercise!I did not lose any weight on the Shiff Green Tea pills. But I do think my energy level was increased a little. Not much that I noticed but it help me get throught the day.I think I am going to try the Shiff Time Release Green Tea pills and see if that product is better.I will not buy this product again."
5,A WONDERFUL SCENT!!!!,"THANKS FOR THIS SCENT!!!! I LOVE IT!!!! VERY CONCENTRATED!!!!SUPER FAST DELIVERY AND GREAT COMMUNICATION!!THANKS AGAIN,ANITA, RN ;-D"
5,Great Bond Book,"As difficult as it is to understand stocks and equity investing, bonds are more complicated and it seems less information is available. ""The Only Guide to a Winning Bond Strategy You'll Ever Need"" is just that, a helpful and concise guide written so that the novice investor will come to understand bonds and investing alternatives. From this practical information one can structure his own portfolio in an intelligent and informed manner. I appreciate the investment tools and strategies this guide has given me and am using the knowledge I have acquired in my current financial planning. For the bond investor I highly recommend this book."
3,Bonds following Modern Portfolio Theory concepts,"I find this book on bonds very unique. It goes over the traditional material on bonds, but what makes it unique is that it looks at bond investments from a Modern porfolio Theory, i.e., you cannot time the market, build a bond portfolio that works under any future interest rate conditions. For those that believe in MPT, it is a great book."
2,No Strategy - Just Basics,"I heard an interview by the author or Alternate Investments. Also in this interview the author talked about how TIPS is a great investment now (Dec 08). I got this book hoping the author will have an implementable point by point specific strategy to build a bond portfolio. But the book covers a lot of grounds about what is a bond , how to calculate yield , what is yield to maturity, what are mortgage backed bonds etc but no specific strategy. Also this book has to be updated with the cost information. For example the book advises against buying Treasury bonds in secondary markets because costs are high. They were high but many brokerages like ETRADE now do not charge a commission for buying TReasury bonds in secondary market.I was dissappointed. THis books real title is BOnds 101 and is good for investors who do not know anything about bonds"
3,Too many words,There is some useful information for the average investment duffer. But the information to word ratio is way too small. Swedroe is a smart guy. His prolixity problem doesn't even approach that of David Swenson---a small consolation for the reader. Next time he should hire a ghost writer.
3,magic piece of paper,"You get what you pay for. The ""magic"" box is made of paper and wrapped in shiny paper to make it look like plastic. Mine was kinda warped when I got it.It is neither impressive nor disappointing. If you can find it at a store near you, I recommend that so you don't have to waste the money on shipping."
5,GREAT!!,"Having known this band from the very beginning, I can truly say that this album is their best work yet!!! ""66"" is a great dance tune!! And...I'm not just saying this because the drummer is my brother!!!"
5,"How hot is ""the Biz?""","One thing about Professor Moore: the man rides motorcycles and has more energy than a 6-year old. He's not the average UCLA professor.Thus, you should be aware that the book reflects it's writer's personality. The book is not only informative, but a pretty fun read as well. Friends from other law schools tell me how dry and dull their entertainment law texts are - a fact which absolutely boggles my mind. The Biz is concisely written, and filled with lively examples"
3,its alright,"The book arrived on time, however, it has a black dot along the edge of the book. The ink has seeped into at least 50 pages, and is actually quite annoying because I'm the sort who likes books pristine. However, because i urgently need this book, i suppose it can't be helped."
3,never arrived,"I ordered this book for my son. The seller has confirmation that the book was delivered, however, the postal carrier has no memory of it and we did not get the book.When the book still hadn't arrived, I emailed the seller to check when to expect it. I was given a confirmation number that indicated that the book had already been delivered so this appears to be a problem with the post office rather than the seller. Over the years, I have ordered used books through Amazon partners and never had any problems until now. Again, the seller can confirm delivery, however, I will not order from this seller again."
2,Dry stuff...,"A fairly dry book based on a biased opinion. This book isn't helpful for anyone trying to broaden their knowledge on Law. Browse through the book at a bookstore, but don't buy it."
4,Seems Like Normal Law and Econ to Me!,"I had heard a lot about David Friedman over the years... mostly words like ""loony"" and ""anarchist."" Being a great admirer of his father's work I decided to give this book a read despite the warnings. I was asolutely shocked to discover that there is absolutely nothing nutty in this book at all! In fact, I dare say it is a rather generic law and economics text book. Like Milton, David succeeds in presenting economic concepts in an entertaining easy-to-read (and perhap more importantly, easy-to-understand) manner. If you've never studied law and econ this seems like a great place to start! If you've already studied the topic, however, I just don't see anything new or terribly interesting here."
4,Book,"The book was fine, it was the shipping length of time that was the problem. By the time my son needed the book, it was already too late. He needed it for school and it arrived after the fact. Disappointing."
5,Fantastic!,"This comic was amazing. I loved the simple way it told about the holocaust. It takes a very difficult subject to approach, and turns it into something anyone can read and understand. The emotion is present in this novel, despite the characters represented as animals. The different animals actually made it easy to see the ridiculousness of separating Jews from Germans from Russians from yada yada. It is ""surprisingly human."""
4,subtly gripping,"There is certainly no shortage of literature published on this subject but ""Maus"" brings something else into the mix. It is not so much a story of surviving the Holocaust, as it is one of not dying in one. Or perhaps not quite dying.Having this story told by a cantankerous old man in this matter of fact manner makes it that much more gripping.Art Spiegelman's choice to represent ethnic groups with different animals was the right one, as noted in other reviews: it captures the essence of genocide subtly yet precisely. The perpetrators see their victims as of different species so they can allow themselves the worst kinds of cruelty without remorse. It does not even matter where the divide lies, be it ethnic, cultural or religious."
4,Great deal,This was a very good deal for the price. The book is in excellent condition and it didn't take very long at all to come in the mail.
4,More than a comic,Anyone who thinks this is like a comic book is greatly mistaken. Spiegelman shows a great depth of talent and even guilt by using the graphic novel to tell the story of his father's time in Nazi occupied Europe while juxtaposing the personal relationship that he and his father fight through in a modern U.S.
4,Thought Provoking Tale of the Holocaust,Maus is not a children's book. It is a deep telling of Art Spielgeman's father and how he survived the holocaust as well as a portrait of the family in modern times. The story also tells of the difficulty of Mr. Spiegelman in telling this story and how he created the work. The art is deceptively simplistic with many great details and fully utilizes the graphic medium.
5,Just as great as Volume I,"It doesn't get any better than this.}It's almost beyond giving it a ""review""....Both I and II are so important and so good. An honor to the six million and more."
5,Not a comic book!,Puts into life the past and the now. How people who lived through the Holocaust kept the habits that they had to learn to survive the Nazi death camps. Old habits are very hard to break.
5,Taught me alot more than i knew...,GREAT BOOK!!! its tells a different side of how the jews genocide went through during that time. taught me alot more than i knew... awesome book!! read for my college course!! you'll never put it down once you read it!
3,turbine vent covers,This product is good for the price and if I get a year out of it that will be just fine. I rated it average because it is nothing special but effective nonetheless.
3,Does the job,Not super heavy duty but should work fine for a season or two. Cheap enough to replace then. Will buy again
3,"Look around for sturdier material, ultraviolet light resistant","Home Depot offers a rubberized canvas cover that will out perform this hands down and last multiple years at that. I wish Amazon stocked it instead. This was less expensive, and will fail from wind damage or ultraviolet light exposure. When you consider paying for the shipment and having to replace more often the lower price doesn't look so good."
5,This Book Shaped My Life,"I first read this book when I was about 12 years old. It is an inspirational story of a kid who was dealt a bad hand in life. His parents are horrible, he has an embarrassing speech problem, and his life circumstances contribute to the demise of his mental stability. The wonderful thing about this book is the heroes he encounters. The friend who can't walk, the beautiful woman who lives in the penthouse, and most importantly the speech therapist who stands up to the terrible mother and really puts her in her place. The speech therapist's role in this story inspired me to take up that career when I became an adult. I recommend this book to anyone over the age of twelve."
4,Writer's Diges Review,"This book is impressive in its exhaustive research. Not only does the author reveal herself as highly schooled but dedicated to her profession of helping clients look at problem solving in a new way with, ""a genuine affinity for my client and his human condition."" The author skillfully weaves in appropriate quotes to substantiate points. As it stands, this book could be promoted as a college-level text.(Review is taken from the evluation sheet given by Writer's Digest and the author's participation in the 11th Annual Internation Self-Published Book Awards) Scale of 1 to 5 was not given by Writer's Digest but was an estimate based on their review."
4,oh raquel,"this one of my favorite raquel movies because of the beautiful scenery, aerial shots, and beach scenes. so you have the sky, sand, water and raquel in a bikini; it doesn't get much better than that."
3,Fathom DVD,"Raquel Welch (37-22-33) in a bikini is the only thing to recommend this typical 60's goofy movie with laughable music, fairly bad acting, silly special effects, and an even sillier ""plot"". But for us guys, is does have Raquel in a bikini...The disc has good quality sound and picture."
4,Racquel Welch gives an amazing performance.,"It takes real dedication and confidence in one's craft to rise above the leering nature of the script and deliver a layered, subtly nuanced performance. Ms. Welch's sacrifice for art is evidenced by her willingness to flatten her chest and let her leg hair grow for the stunt scenes involving a mad bull.Seriously, though, I enjoyed the film. A lot. It had some good twists in the silly yet straightforward manner manner of many 60's caper-ish films, a fast pace, some decent writing, some suspense, and nice location shooting.But it probably would not stand up so well to repeat viewings, as what I enjoyed the most was definitely the skimpy outfits on display. There's nothing like a green bikini to gloss over a movie's shortcomings.But you knew that."
1,"Product may be adequate, but company is unethical.","Product may be adequate, but company is unethical. Their product apparently is so awful that they have to advertise by sending spam (unsolicited messages) advertising their unwanted products. Please don't support this evil company. Thanks!"
5,Awesome! Pure Fun & Laughter,I just wrote a review for this same product but underArcSoft Funhouseso please read that review it is titled the same
4,a little complicated,"Haven't done step for awhile, so I found this dvd a little too complicated to start back up--moves a little more advanced, and tempo a little quick, but I will keep on trying! Nice to have a challenge to work towards."
2,not for beginners!!!,"I tried it but felt disillusioned after 10 minutes of not being able to keep up, epsepcially since I have to do mirror image to what I am seeing on the screen. Will have to try som other dvd meant for beginners to learn to do steps rather than a means to show off the pretty women and how fit they are!"
3,Limited life,You get what you pay for; they don't last long but work well when new. Kind of flimsy but adequate. Great wedding present for someone you don't like much.
5,Didn't want it to end,"I read through this novel faster than I thought I would. This book compels you from the first couple of pages and when you finish the first chapter, you know that the journey that this family will face will be unbearable. I felt that Boehringer left a lot to the reader's imagination with regard to what Meg's husband was really doing behind closed doors and I found myself becoming increasingly angry at this character. This novel is emotionally overwhelming and well written and I have several friends who can't wait for me to lend it to them. The only complaint that I have is that you don't truly know what happened to Meg in the end...but that is what our imagination is for!"
3,Disappointing,Once I started this book I was unable to put it down. Boehringer gets into a woman's psyche with regards to grief and the loss of a child. The ending was a true disappointment. She summed up 245+ pages in less than half a page. It leaves you hanging for more; asking what happened next.
5,IM LOOKING FOR NIKKI,I REMEMBER THIS SONG: IT WENT IM LOOKING FOR NIKKIN AND ALL HER FREAKY FRIENDS. THIS IS AN OLD SONG BUT IT WAS GOOD. I WOULD RECOMMED PEOPLE BUY THE SINGLE OR C.D. B/C LIL WILL COULD SING.
1,Wrong Colors!,"Although Moon Costume's cosplays are usually very good quality - in this case, the colors is incorrect from the anime and manga series!! The skirt and arm guards are supposed to be pink, not tan as pictured. Also, the headband should be red, not black!! Beware purchasing this - you will be the laughingstock at the convention for these mistakes!!"
1,Overwrought,"There are a couple of interesting ideas here, which given the length of this book is not a very good batting average. The ""deep"" thoughts are mostly pretentious and often off topic. You can buy 3 or 4 much better noir studies for the cost of this one."
5,"softtform 11"" lumbar back support with flexible stays","This 11"" lumbar back support with flexible stays is wonderful! I have lower back problems from artritis. I was desperate for relief from the pain. I bought this support and within days of wearing it, the pain began to go bye bye! I am a small woman, and tried several back braces I purchased at the drug store. They were all too big and offered little support because there was no way to accomodate for my waist. In other words, no way to snug the brace to a firm fit around my waist, thus to support my lower back. This brace can be adjusted to a firm fit that supports the lower back. If your lower back hurts,and you are a woman with a waistline, do not buy a ""one size fits all"" back support, buy this one and you will not be disappointed. I am very pleased with both this lower back support and the quick delivery of this purchase."
5,A must read guide,"Many brides consult me, about their wedding, I always recommend this book for them to read before their wedding. It gives all the answers to the expected and unexpected difficult situations before and during this critical period."
5,Excellent tennis ballhopper!,Indeed a very high quality product that can carry 150 balls in a lightweight bag. The base has good smooth wheels and collapse well to fold easily into the slim case. The bag balances well on the expanded base and does not tip over as you push and pull it all over the court.Perfect for tennis drill sessions. Remember to carry the ball tubes or small metal baskets to pick the balls off the ground.
5,Top-rate Organ recording.,"This is by far the best recording of an organ I have heard. Credit is due to four virtuosi: the organist, David Higgs, of course... but also the designer of the fabulous Fisk tracker, and Pei Cobb Freed & Partners, the architects of Dallas's Morton H. Meyerson Hall; and finally, but not least, the genius of the recordists in using (if I remember the notes correctly) only two microphones. All four components got it right - a feat that is rarely accomplished.All the tracks are simply superb. Best of them all, however, is Track 9, The Primitives, from Calvin Hampton's suite of Five Dances. It is a scintillating masterpiece with a strong 16' reed component that revolves like a string of DNA -- and shows off in integrated perfection, the organist, instrument, hall and recording. It is a daring piece that could draw attention to and exaggerate flaws in the acoustics, but there are none.Absolutely recommended."
4,belivable viewpoint,"this book presents a reasonable approach to understanding the book of revelation in a manner that is usable in today's world,not the familar ""left behind ""approach."
2,"Not awful, but not what I expected","I was looking for a set of cards that would instruct me, not only in the correct way to form the mudras, but in the meaning, purpose and effect of each mudra. I guess you could say, I was looking for more technical information. Well, you have to go to Hirshci's book if you want that. The book and the cards really go together, and you will be missing important points if you don't have them both. I found that some of the cards had instructions, some didn't. Some of the cards had the purpose, some didn't. None of the cards that I could see had contraindications (and there are some). And all of the cards had some sort of meditation on them, which is cool if you need guidance in meditating. I was moderately disappointed. I'm not sorry I bought the cards. They are a nice set. But I could have spent my money better elsewhere."
3,Missing yoga cards/ Yoga book,"I think the book will be helpful for me, but I never got the cards. I thought they would be delivered in a separate order but it never came."
1,"yoga cards are a good idea, ...but not these","What a great idea! So, I bought the cards and opened the nicely marketed package to find hard to understand illustrations and non-descript type. This product could be helpful for the ultimate beginner, but I would not even recommend it for them. I was very disappointed with the content of the cards and the intangibility of the text. What was the purpose and where is the teaching?"
5,Human Tragedy,"This book is very haunting in its so detailed description of mental illness at its very core. There is no morality question to be answered here. I feel had he lived, Robert Rowe would have gone on & found a reason to kill his second wife & child. When you look at the horrific crime he committed, you are looking at what he did from a 'logical mind', with mental illness there is never logic. Go read case files & histories on mental patients who are in Forensic Centers for committing the same or similar horrific crimes & you will begin to understand Robert Rowe much better. The tragedy here is the state of New York & how he was able to leave that Forensic Center. He should have been there for life as are others who have committed such horrific crimes. Julie Salamon did an excellent job in her information gathering for her book. I am still haunted by this tragic story after having read the book. Hopefully the right state officials in New York read this book."
4,"grace, guts, and moral ambivalence","This is an unusual book, similar to The Adversary, also an account of a man murdering his family in France. In this book, the group of women bonded by their handicapped chldren are heroines to be sure; they should be the primary subject. My problem is with the moral ambivalence of so many people, nearly all we meet but the women's group and one young lawyer who eventually got Bob Rowe disbarred. Rowe murdered his family, was aquitted by reason of insanity, but went on to live a full if troubled life. He himself saw no reason why he should not be allowed to again practice law and many friends, old and new, spoke out in his behalf. The man was a cold-blooded murderer, no matter how depressed and stressed he was. That there are people who can forgive this heinous a crime is a mystery to me and is a dismal reminder of the moral relativism our society has come to embrace."
5,Ordinary people are extraordinary in their capacity for love,"Julie Salamon demonstrates the capacity of men and women, particularly women, to see, through the lens of extreme horror, the resilience of the human spirit. Her measured prose carefully and thoroughly recounts a story of horror, of murder, and of madness. The reader experiences an unbelievable, yet actual story of the capacity (and need) of people, whose lives are overwhelmed by their children's physical and emotional handicaps, to offer redemption. It is a moving book, and for this reader, transforming."
3,Disappointed,"As a psychotherapist, I was quite anxious to read this book. My disappointment stems from the fact that there were no real answers - I could not discern the redemption and reconciliation, only the unanswered questions and the cycle of despair. The story was interesting but I had hoped for a much more in depth examination of Bob Rowe."
3,....misses the mark,"Good fictionalized novelization though. Points to the author for picking up historical subject matter and trying to make Bob Rowe sound redeemable, but she couldn't make me buy it."
3,Well written but lacking in some areas,"This book was well written, very engaging and unforgettable. Bob Rowe comes across as a highly intelligent man....sometimes too intelligent. How could a man suddenly ""snap"" and blame it on a dead women ( his mother ) who was no longer around to defend hereself? And he was a lawyer? Sounds a bit fishy to me. The dead can't speak so I guess we'll have to buy what Julie Saloman is dishing out here. The book is well researched and non judgemental....although its strange that NONE of the surviving Rowe family were interviewed for this book ( except for the deranged rantings of Rowes second wife Colleen who does a fine job painting Bob Rowe as some kind of saint ) I highly recommend the book as it is not your typical ""true crime"" book but I'd like to have some holes filled in for me....where are the people in this book who havent had their chance to speak yet? I'd like to read their book!"
5,Worth Paying for the Hard Back,"I borrowed this book from the library because I didn't want to pay the hard-back price for a book I might not like. This is such an excellent book, I know now that I wouldn't have minded paying for it. I highly recommend it. And, believe me, I'm very hard to please. That's why I usually get books from the library.I'm sorry the author hasn't written other books like this one. After I read it, I got another nonfiction book she's written, and it bored me."
1,Why didn't they ask the surviving Rowes????,I was horrified to hear this true story book was taken without taken the facts from the Rowe family who had to witness and bear this tradegy. This book should have a disclaimer stating this is an interpretation of the author and not a credible historical account. Authors should not needlessly display a family's personal life without consulting them for facts. That is very irresponsible to the feelings of the surviving Rowe Family who have to relive the dug up remains of their past. This book reeks of one sided journalism and lost its luster in my eyes.
2,Something's Missing,This book was a huge disappointment. I felt little knowledge and insight into the killer's mind. Many people have medically involved children and do not commit such horrific acts. The bludgeoning of his family had to some from a source of fierce anger and the cause of that wasn't explained at all . His attitude towards the crime was totally unbelievable.
1,facing the wind,"Insulting. Very, very poorly written, haphazardly thought out, carelessly drawn, pointlessly plodding and distracted. In every way that a writer can go wrong this writer does, and the end result is a terrible, uncrafted, frustrated and pointless book. Be Warned!"
3,Well Written Soap Material,"I can see where the hook is with this story. As a avid soap fan, I can see where the author has created a successful merging of real facts and emotional, passionate literary devices employed by the screen writers for the soaps. The villian, who seen as good at the end, dies in a way great soap characters go.... as a little misunderstood person. Classic soap material, friends. That's why it appealed to me."
1,For those who love Jerry Springer.....,"This book has all the ingrediants of a Jerry Springer show. All you are missing is an audience whooping and yelling throughout the story, which is well written overwise. It introduces a vulgarly horrific tale and then attempts to soften the image of the protagonist. I guess a Nightmare on Elm Street can have a meaningful and spritually uplifting twist to it too, if written correctly."
2,Journalistic skimming of the surface,"A quick and easy read, but a little flip and trying to be too hip. This book will ring hollow to most who have visited the island. I was pretty disappointed at encounters that pumped up to be more meaningful than they seem on paper. Comes off as journalistic tourism."
2,How to use a math book without an answer key?,"While I like the layout and content of the book, it does not include an answer key, unlike all the other books in this very good series. The Table of Contents does not list a key, so it's not a case of the key having been removed by a former user. As a teacher, I'm unable to use the book without the key unless I solve all the problems myself - which I'm unwilling to do!"
5,junie b jones,"me,a nine year old girl just loves this book! i think it is the best book barbara park has written."
4,Best Book Ever,"I loved it, it was really funny!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)And so what May and Junie B. Jones don't reallylike either but... they still had fun!!!!! :)"
5,Great books!,My 7 yr old daughter loves all of the Junie B. Jones books...she's hysterical the whole time she reads them.
3,little children fun,everyday a child should read. i loved this book. reccomend it for 5_9 year olds.
2,Inappropriate Reading,"This book is intended for a first-grade reader. The grammar is atrocious and it contains a lot of slang. My granddaughter asked for these chapter books and I have purchased 12 so far. On a recent visit, I decided to read one of the books to her and again was astonished at the content. I will be looking for a new more appropriate set of chapter books for a first grade reader and won't be buying Junie B Jones books anymore."
5,Hilarious,It is a very funny book and with Junie B. Jones in it you neverKnow what's coming next! ENJOY!!
5,Great book,These books are perfect for my 7 year old. The Junie b. jones series is a great one and this was a perfect Christmas stocking stuffer.
5,birthday gift,granddaughter loved the book and she especially liked the finish on the book. they have a shiny gold finish on them
5,Junie B. Jones Jingle Bells,I love everything about this book. The song is the best!P.S. So does Maaaaaay...!!!!
2,Of historical value only,"For the 1950s, when this book was written, it had imaginative hypotheses. However, the psychoanalytic ideas on which it was based are rather discredited in this day and age. The methodology was also innovative for that time.By the way, the authors are John Whiting and Irvin Child. Please make the necessary corrections."
4,Savages,"I read most of this book seventy years ago. Even then I found it distasteful, though gripping. It describes a training camp for youngsters whose destiny it was to rule the world. Not a trace of respect for the dignity of human beings as such. Adolf would have this work; it describes how to make warriors. The ideal is to be ""stalky"", i.e. wily and ruthless. If you loved British imperialism, this is the book for you."
5,Great Date Flick!,"What a cool film - one of the best romantic comedies I've seen in years. Its basically a story about one couple's journey to understand what each other needs in a relationship, and the quirky turns they go through to get to the truth. I loved Josh Meyers in the lead male role, and Kristen Ritter really showed her dramatic muscle as his girlfriend. And there was solid chemistry between them both, which made the story all the more credible. Oh, and let's not forget Ken Jeong and Jenna Jameson's characters - off the charts funny! Great date movie!"
4,Good movie,Watched this movie in order to see Ian Somerhalder. I was a bit sad that he did not have a bigger part. He does well with the part he does have though. I enjoyed this movie and I am glad I bought it. Funny and very full of laughs. Give it a look.
2,"Fair, not great","Same old, same old Flatt & Scruggs,. Rather boring. Every tune ends with the da, da, da, da, da ------da,da! I need a break."
5,"If you like Harry Potter, you'll love this!","This is a fantastic book! If you are a Harry Potter fan, then you definatly need to read this. Our heroine, Mildred, is in her first year at Miss Cackles Academy for witches. She tries hard, but everything she does seems to go wrong! When she is almost expelled for ruining the halloween festival and discracing her school, Mildred runs away, but runs into a group of Witches plotting trouble for the Academy! Mildred saves the day and comes out shining! This is a must-have story for young children, But don't let the size of the book fool you, This is a great read for ALL ages! Jill Murphy truly has weaved magic."
5,I think the cd is great.,I think the movie and the cd was great. Ihave one thing to say I think that Susie Carmichael should be included un more productions of the Rugrats.
5,Wonderful sexy romp,"I bought this book on a recommendation from a review. Tonight I'm buying the first book in the series. If it is half as good, it's well worth the time. I'm so glad I did. This is one of the funniest books I've read in along time. Thank you J.M. Jeffries and ImaJinn Books. Hurry up with book #3."
1,Stay away from this one!!!!,This movie has a somewhat good cast but a very bad plot. Full of shootups and bangups but a senseless story line. The acting is terrible and Rourke has a limited speaking part. This movie became boring after 5 minutes--so predictable and I found myself advancing chapters to get thru the movie. Take my advice--avoid this movie. Not worth the cost of rental--use like the other reviewer said--as firewood--one of the worst movies i ever saw--and I have seen plenty!!!!
1,Point Blah,"There were some 5 star reviews written about this fiasco of a movie. After watching it for myself, I can tell you that the 1 star reviews are by far the most accurate. The action scenes are horribly choreographed. The dialogue in the script was stolen form other better movies and re-assembled by a hack. The acting was wooden. The actor playing Wallace, who has played this role multiple times in other films, was the only actor who held up his end. Mickey Rourke is terrible and un-watchable.It is really not worth watching. Please spare yourself the agony. All copies of this movies should be burned so others do no make the mistake I did. The only satisfying point is that I did not pay to see it, please remove this film from Prime."
5,Wonderful,"The combind work of Jim Stubblefield, J.P., and Liza Carbe is not only wonderful, it stands head and shoulders above much of what is out there in the world music scene. Passionate and firey, envoking and true to its name Misterioso is a must have CD."
5,An amazing musical experience!,"I saw this band perform recently and these guys are burning. Jim and Jean-Pierre are both amazing guitar players. Although they have a similar sound to bands like Strunz and Farah or Jesse Cook, this band has a rock energy that really showcases the fire of the tunes! The CD has some really cool middle eastern grooves and even a pseudo Celtic-flamenco tune! I highly recommend this disc and the HDCD mastering is an added bonus for people that have this feature on their CD player. Can't wait for their next release."
3,Flamenco Bland,"The music is OK but it sounds all the same as far as the samples of music are shown. It lacks fire, meaning and soul. Just another bunch of well meaning people trying to pull off some kind of popular commercial spanish/american music. If you want to hear great instrumental flamenco pop listen to the guitarist from the gypsy kings and how his instrumentals come off.Federico, Valdez Guitar Shop"
1,Whilst hanging at the book store,"Whilst I was travelling the States on a book tour I caught these chaps and chappies at a local book store. Except for the knawing, repetitive hand slappies and the similarity from one selection to the next I felt like strolling to the nearest record store to pick up a Strunz and Farah album."
4,josh & sneazel3000,Josh is always in trouble.Even if he moves.I got it beter.I never get in trouble.^_^. It was a good book when i mean got it was good..... well c ya
4,It worked for me,"I decided I wanted to quit smoking for the last time and purchased this book one year ago. I have not smoked since although I have gained weight, I am a non smoker and don't even think about it any more. I think it will help someone that really wants to quit."
2,Did not work,"I read this book and listen to the CD,but I still could not stop smoking. I was so excited to try this program. I have listen to the CD at lease 5 times and still I want to smoke. My husband also tryed this and he is still smoking. We really want to quit but this did not work."
1,Not good for me,"I was very excited to try this book. I read it and listened to the cd twice before going to sleep. The next morning, I started smoking without a second thought. Quite disappointing.........."
5,amazing,"I have been smoking a pack a day since 1985. I have tried everything to quit, patches, gum, lozenges, and I even went to a hypnotist.I have no idea what it is about this cd but it worked. I read the book first then listened to the cd before I went to bed. I woke up the next morning with out any desire to smoke. I still had the habit of smoking. After I would eat I would think ""I need a cigarette"" but then the thought of it made me sick. In fact the smell makes me want to vomit. Even just thinking about smoking makes me cringe. I am finally a non-smoker. I finally have my life back and I don't stink anymore.I am loaning and purchasing this for all my smoking friends. Never have I had such great results from hynosis for anything."
3,"I lasted 2 days, smoked the third and so on.","What more can I say? I've listened to the CD many times, did the breathing exercises, and read the book. I guess this only works for some people."
2,I wish it worked!,"Such confident assertions in the title, NO headaches, NO cravings...to be honest, that's one of the reasons why I bought the book and CD! However, it's day 8, and while I have not smoked, I am miserable, headachey, hungry, cramps in my gut, and with powerful cravings that drive me batty. I listened to the CD the first morning I quit and then again three days later. I also read the book. Sounds like it's helped a lot of people but it didn't do much for me."
1,Don't buy anything from Awesomebooksusa,"I can not rate this book, to the fullest degree, as the vendor did not include the CD that was a critical part of the book. I have tried to resolve the problem and was offered a refund of 10.85 (75%) versus a full refund of $14.46. There was no return address or packing slip enclosed with the book so I don't know where to send it, other than the UK. I strongly urge all not to order anything from this company. I found some information on the ""company"" and it's an individual working out of a home in GB, not a real company, just an individual trying to scam people by selling merchandise that is incomplete, trashed, or misrepresented. STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!"
4,the wild inside,"While Snyder and Harrison aren't usually associated with one another,they are apparently friends for some time.I'm not sure how this film was put together,the outdoor scenes taking place in a location neither lives in, but the casual conversation and the shared values are interesting to witness.It is not directly taken from Snyder's book of the same title,but his is always for me an interesting mind.I wonder if he sees in Harrison a kind of incarnation of some crazy Han Shan Chinese poet;he sort of resembles such a character,rather disheveled and wildeyed.But the exterior(as Snyder teases him at one point) hides a mind besotted with wonder and thought.I enjoyed their company,though it isn't a definitive look at either.Just two men in the world who appreciate the practice of the wild mind,the wilderness within and without us, the ""joyful interpenetration' as Snyder once wrote"
4,Thorough academic review,"This is an exceedingly dense review of four feminist political theories: liberal feminism, marxist feminism, radical feminism, and socialist feminism. Jaggar is incredibly thorough, and sometimes a bit redundant - probably in an effort to miss nothing. Her review covers these theories and their relations to contemporary politics, human nature, and each other. Probably a good starting point for anyone interested in Feminist Political Theory provided you're not overwhelmed by her rhetoric and style of writing. Otherwise, very valuable."
3,"Flawed, but not a bad read","This book was needed for a college reading assignment. The book's contents were interesting but actually making sense of the purpose of the contents was difficult. When posed the question, ""What is the thesis of this book?"" it took nearly an hour to dissect what exactly the author's true purpose for writing this book was in a form that would be accepted by my college professor.Needless to say, this was aggravating and I hope to never have to analyze a book by this author again."
1,Numerous Grading Errors,"I got this book primarily for the practice tests on CD. When taking the tests, I enter the correct answer (even stated correct on the explanation) but the program marks it incorrect. I have to keep a running tally of the problem questions in order to recalculate my overall scores - usually anywhere in the neighborhood of 5-8% higher after I factor the bad questions out."
1,AWFUL,"You can read the other reviews for the ""why"" but I just had to add my voice to theirs in saying that this is the worst study aid I have ever encountered. Now I know why it was the only one left in the bookstore when I purchased it. I didn't think you could publish something with so many errors or blatantly wrong answers."
2,Not what you would expect...,"After missing the mark on the Series 7 by only one question (yes, one lousy question), I bought this book to provide me with additional practice. Yes, there are many errors and it is quite frustrating. But, the other problem is that the book covers what my STC instructor deems ""untestable items."" In other words, don't waste your time. The Dummies Guide is a much beter supplement."
1,Terrible - a monkey could have proofread better than the editors,So many of the questions and answers are incorrect - just blatently wrong. It would probably be more misleading to read this then to not.
1,too many mistakes and errors...,"I was going over the options chapter, a very critical part of the series 7 and there were mistakes...on repeating questions and wrong explainations, also the explainations are not sufficient enough."
4,"This 1963 album is great fun, but --","If you were looking for the _Tremendo Cumban_ album by Machito and his Afro-Cuban Orchestra which was recorded in New York from 1949 to 1952, this CD is NOT THE ONE. The album you are looking at was recorded later in stereo and first released in 1963. Only two songs are the same on the two different albums. The older album available from Tumbao Cuban Classics has 20 songs and this newer one has 12. On the good side, these songs are very fun, catchy and sexy -- the band is hot! Graciela Perez sings her heart out with Machito and the boys. And the sound quality is excellent, given the time period. On the minus side, you are missing some great early cuts including a number featuring Mitch Miller on ""Oboe Mambo""."
5,"Gripping, personal account","I just read this 343 paged story of the account of my dad's first cousin's experience as a soldier and prisoner of war, and I will never think the same about the sacrifices made by soldiers as I did before reading this.One can also glean insight into the human heart or nature, when it is threatened, or starved, alone and isolated or in a pack or group.And for me personally, this story makes me proud of the contribution Bilyeus have made to the United States, not only in wars but many other ways, since the first Billiou (later Bilyeu) landed at what was then called New Amsterdam back in 1661, as Huguenots sailing here from Leyden, Holland, just 41 years after the Pilgrims."
5,Great book by a Great Man,"I normally wouldn't pick up a book about war to read. I knew Dick and that it took him decades to get his story the way he wanted. I sensed he was someone who's story i wanted to read. I too, couldn't put it down. This is a story that truely tells the horror of WAR and what ""Man's inhumanity towards Man"" really is. Dick's book made me a more appreciative American."
2,Useless,"I go to Bishop Dunne Catholic High School in Dallas, Texas. We never use this book. It is basically the appendix of a Literature book. It tells you all the rules for this and that and stuff that I never need. (Anyway we have a grammar book that tells us all those things) If you need something for English reference for things like abbreviations and grammar rules I reccomend you buy it. If not don't bother."
1,A 12 minute segment for $17.95,"First let me say any information on the mysterious bee colony collapse that is spreading like a virus through our country is welcome. People only think of honey when they think of bees but they pollinate our fruit crops and if this nightmare continues without a solution it will be devastating to our farmers, beekeepers and food economy.The true horror is that the CBS 60 minutes show took a 12 minute segment on this mystery and is selling it for $17.95.They could have at least provided the whole 60 minute episode for the price, or added a book on beekeeping.So please look before you buy. This is not a sixty minute DVD, but a 12 minute segment from the CBS 60 Minutes show. And at more than $1 a minute, I think you can find the same information on Amazon in the following new books:Bees Besieged by Bill MaresFruitless Fall by Rowan JacobsenA Spring without Bees by Michael SchackerA World Without Bees by Alison Benjamin"
4,Bungalow Heaven,"Nice book on Chicago's own bungalow tradition. Nice pictures of not only classic Chicago bungalows, but of many of it's inhabitants in the great Chicago Bungalow Belt. Only wish the book was longer and had more color photos, but it does show examples of my favorite part of the Chicago bungalows from the 1920's, art glass. They will NEVER build houses like these again. Attention to the Southside as well as the Northside belts. Recommended reading for us lay people who love Chicago's unique brick bungalows."
3,These houses have more style than it appears,"The book wasn't what I expected from a book with this title. But, I'm glad someone wrote it and wished they had focused more on the architecture, the many styles, and the seemingly endless stained glass designs in the front windows of the fancier bungalows. Overall it was very nice to see and a decent read. I had lived in one on a corner lot and appreciated the author's discussion of face brick, and other details on corner houses."
5,Creative and interesting book,"This is an easy to understand cook book with plenty of great recipes. It is also a guide to decorative painting. In both cases, the 'instructions' are easy to understand. The Author makes it fun."
3,Slightly Let down,"While it was nice to read a dark fantasy collection with a gay theme I was expecting a lot more from this book, based off of reviews I had read on amazon. Not terribly tawdry, which was a plus and very well conceptualized by the author. Some of the stories are exceptionally short and reminiscent to newsgroup or posting board fictions. Once the character of Caleb and the stories revolved around The Fallen begin, things start to get interesting. As the second part of the book progresses a continuity is desired but never achieved, which was a disappointment. So all in all the book was entertaining but not, in my opinion, a 5 star title. I would read another book by the author to see if his narrative has continuity and see what other interesting ideas come from him."
3,Great attempt Halford!,"Rob Halford is hands down one of the greatest Metal singers ever! Any Metalhead can tell ya as such. After leaving J.P. he started the band Fight, had some commercial success with his solo band Halford, and had this band Two. Two is and Industrial Metal band made up of Halford, John 5 (Marilyn Manson), and mixed by Trent Reznor (NIN). When I learned that prior to buying the album I thought it would be the greatest thing in recent music releases, but I was dissapointed. Although the music is indeed NIN-ish with a Halford twist there aren't any songs that really stick out. The whole album is very similar. Fans of Halford's voice and John 5's playing, and Industrial fans will all find elements on this CD that they enjoy; just don't get your hopes up too high..."
4,Good One Off,"This is a good one off album by Rob Halford's never was band Two with John Lowery on guitars and electronic bass and drums. All the hype for this album and it sold like 22,000 copies and is out of print when multi platinum was the standard. He was given a makeover by Nothing Records owner Trent Reznor, to put Judas Priest behind him and update his basic sound to sound like it was the future. Considering the mass of bad press this album got, the album is really good music. Contrary to reviews, it is nothing like Nine Inch Nails. Trent Reznor delights in parodying totally 80s rock stars like Halford and Manson, forcing them to update their sound. No weak tracks here, but it's not a masterpiece. Feel sorry for Rob Halford, to stoop that low for one failed album."
4,Good Album!,"Dude, this album is like totally awesome! However, it did seem to have a few bad things about it. Really only one, it was a little too techno for me. If you like rock and techno, this is your type 'o' band. That is all I have to say about that."
2,The Metal Vocal God has diminished!,"The high pitched Halford is gone! This is an interesting CD due to Rezor's genius with electronic, thrash, music, but the half-hearted lyrical tones are covered by noisy music that doesn't match the crispness of KK and Glen of J.Priest. How can Halford actually like what he is doing? It's pretty funny that this album has a single already released called DEEP IN THE GROUND that will make Halford more money than he's seen in 10 years.JUST A THOUGHT: I think Rob Halford, Bruce Dickinson, and Geoff Tate should get together and do a ""Three Tenors"" of Heavy Metal. Now that would be great!"
2,"Of course Halford is God, but you guys must be kidding","Is every review on this website some kind of homage to the artist? I am a Priest fan and I've got the tattoos to prove it, so of course I bought this alum as soon as it was released. The nasal, whiney and complaining sound of this album killed me. If you follow Halford at all, go to his website and you'll see that he was not happy with this album and at one point was even offering pre-Reznor mixes of half the songs on the album. I swore I'd never buy another Halford album after this and the second Fight album... but wait: Resurrection is coming and I may have to change my tune."
1,Ye Gods! Wot Happened!?!,"I pulled this CD out of my collection and gave it a listen, again with an open mind...I hate to say this, but it is STILL unlistenable! I'm all for trying different things and I love both metal and industrial, but this album just can't make it happen! Halford's voice is and always will be one of the best! No one can top him ! Save your money and order an ""Old"" Priest album or Fight, or wait for the new Priest album with Halford again on vocals!!"
3,"Not bad, but nothing worth talking about.","The first 2 songs on this album are great and the rest of them are either alright or they suck. The best song on the album I found was Stutter Kiss. The rest of them could have been a lot better. The vocals and songwriting are all right but nothing amazing. I never listen to Judas Priest so I can't compare them to this cd. I found the vocals a little on the annoying side, maybe this is why I didn't take well to this album.If I were going to tell you if you should buy it, then I would say no. I'd just download Stutter kiss and the first song."
3,Nonsense lyrics put to excellent music,"I have never heard any of Rob Halford (vocals) in his previous group, Judas Priest, therefore I have no idea if nonsensing lyrics are his style; one thing is apparent, though, nonsense lyrics run rampant on this album. Maybe I'm just not deep enough to understand lyrics such as ""Who put all this/dirt in my machine?/All I did was/try to keep it clean"" and ""Take this train/put it on the window/tell me if it moves."" The music, I have to admit, is addictive and, in my opinion, beautifully mixed but the lyrics throw me. If you enjoy Nine Inch Nails (Trent Reznor was the Executive Producer for the album) I think you may enjoy Two, but I'd say listen before you buy if you can."
5,"Halford is God, no matter what he sings","I may not have been so keen on His Fight material, it was a little to thrashy for me, but this album is definitely one of the best he's ever made. I was fortunate enough to see him on the ""Voyeurs"" tour and I couldn't get enough of this material. May the other metal gods bless and keep you Rob, you're one of them and I'm looking forward to the next output of the Rob Halford band. As long as you don't yodel, kiddo, I'll buy it."
3,Good! But++not the excellent Rob we've known.,I have got to be one of the biggest fans of Rob Halford ever! This album is good but not good enough to keep. I have never let go of a Priest album+EVER!+ but this one went fast.Whats up Rob? Come on!So your not with the priest!Now show me some of that great metal talent your known for. Ive been to every tour youve ever done with the priest. Show me more of that good stuff. Man! Your the man! Come home = PLEASE!
4,NOT TOO BAD!!!,"Those of you who think that cd is too bad are wrong !!! Rob you still can sing, I know !!! This cd should be bought by those who like fear factory or somethinh\g of the kind."
3,NOT BAD at aLL,HALFORDTRENT REZNORJOHN 5 ex MANSON guitarist...I AM A PIG = awesomness lolI liked it and need to get this album back... :( you never know what your missing untill you get rid of it...
5,All I can Say is WOW,"This is possibly the best Rockabilly band in years and years. The two albums they have are my two greatest buys. I know rockabilly, neo, traditional whatever, Ive listened for years..this is the real deal. If you are like me, enjoying a wide variety of rockabilly, this is the band you have been hoping to find, from high energy guitar riffs, growling vocals, this is the band. I guarentee this will be in your cd tray for weeks at a time. I cant say enough about Rockin Ryan and the Realgoners, except thank you! Keep rocking!"
5,the dreamlike state of dying,"This work stands firmly as one of the masterpieces of 20th century literature, and is not to be missed by the thoughtful reader willing to spend some time with a great book. As mentioned by other reviewers, the writing, especially the feverish second part (it's a book of four parts), is dense and can be challenging to get through, though that effort will be well paid by the discussion with Augustus in the third, and the sublime death trip of the fourth and final part. The first part documents Virgil's arrival into burning Rome, and sets up what is to follow. One needn't have read anything by Virgil in preparation for this book, and to the best of my knowledge, Broch, though running from the Nazi's, never spent time in a concentration camp. And, for the curious, Broch's grave is in Connecticut."
2,biased and uninteresting,"This book has a snide tone to it that I noticed right away. The purpose of this book seems to be to present Washington's early career in the harshest light possible. For the many assertions of what Washington was thinking or feeling at any given time, I would like to have seen some sources referenced in the text. There is a bibliography at the end of this book, but no footnotes or backup for any specific claims of the narrative. It also got bogged down in way too many details of the squabbles he had with everyone around him. I'm sure there were more interesting aspects of his life that could have been explored. This book was a disappointment to me."
2,come again?,"How does this sum up the spirit of Hannukah and Christmas? (replying to a comment made by previous customer). To me, this is a nice painting, but basically, just that. The sentiment aside, it could be used for any *winter* theme, if anything. Looked at closely, seems to me that the people in the painting are drunk and leaning into each other for support on the way home. Nope, definitely not a *holiday* card, unless you're celebrating it at AA. Nothing in it inspires me to the season of giving and the holy. Now if you replace the people with a jovial and tired Santa.. maybe?"
5,The Flintster strikes again....,"The blu-ray from Twilight Time looks fantastic, with 5.1 audio this time around....also a commentary, 1.0 mono, and a 2.0 isolated score track....and a lot of short documentary-type things.... This is the best I've ever seen this film look....highly recommended for Flint fans....worth it for the ballet alone.... Zowie!!!!...."
3,"Fun, but not as fun as Our Man Flint","Flint is an interesting character, an intelligent spoof of Ian Flemming's James Bond.In Like Flint is not as strong a story as Our Man Flint, for a number of reasons, but it is still worthy of watching if you like the Action Spy Genre.The weaknesses of In Like Flint are more along the lines of in retrospect. Several of the concepts seem outdated, from the dolphin conversations to the Cryogenics to the space programs.The movie is fun if somewhat shallow.The DVD extras are very weak. There is little there other than theatrical trailers of other movies from the same period."
3,"[Three and-a-half stars] Ode to James Coburn, (not Jared Flint!)","A very fine sequel, which almost surpassesthe original James Coburn Jame Bond parody,Our Man Flint. Somewhat along the lines of'Wrongway Goldfarb, Please Phone Home...'Sucky beginning slightly hurts the proceed-ings and keeps it from being as good (or be-tter!) than first installment! Coburn wasoutstanding in these two films. Lee J. Cobbis back for round two also, but not seen asmuch!"
2,turned out to be diff from what i was expecting,"this book was suggested text for a course for security applications at GaTech (if i rem correctly). so went ahead and bought it for some self-study. it covers a great deal of mpeg-4 in the first few chapters but is very dated. mpeg-4 was not standardized when this was written and i've become familiar with mpeg-4 / h.264 since and found a lot of this material a little out of sync with the current standard.the other chapters are also good overviews of the state-of-art in various fields, e.g. cmos sensor devices but since technology in these areas changes so fast, book seems dated there as well."
1,Vienna,"I love Linda Eders voice but this is the worst I have heard! Her other CD's are very very good, but this one will go in the trash."
5,A rare gem in a display case full of 90's gravel,"Amazingly I met the band in Tulsa by accident when they were doing an in-store performance at Mohawk Music (R.I.P.). They were loading up their van and I asked them who they were and then bought one of their c.d.'s and had them sign it without even knowing what they sounded like (they were great guys). All that aside, the c.d. is incredible, quick, intelligent, well-written and certainly worthy of more accolades than I could ever put forth. If you can find this c.d., buy it, first because it is awesome and secondly because its probably in a bargain bin near you."
5,one of the best pop records of all time,"This is one of few cds I can listen to over and over again. It is absolutly flawless. Buy it now. Theyre later albums are good, but this is the best."
3,Dearfoam's lippers,"The slippers I received although the package was labelled Microfiber Terry Closed back With Organza Trim were just plain terry cloth with some sort of intiialing on the front. The are not what was portrayed on the website.Shoes are OK, but nothing great."
4,Nice Slipper,Slipper is very soft and laundries well. The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is because they slide off my heel. Only a little frustrating. Wish they had stronger back band.
4,Very Useful,"Went through it for a couple of days improving my tecnique.Therefor I recommend this Double Bass tutor.Too bad, there doesn't seem to be a follow up on this second book of Double bass tutoring.Soeren Hasemann, Denmark"
2,BE CAREFUL,"These 'pearls' are beautiful and a great deal. But be wary because they are so heavy, that the clasp is prone to breaking- and sadly, you can't return them for new ones from this seller. It's only possible to get a refund and reorder the same necklace, but after all the hassle I don't want to risk it with the same product. Very sad as I liked the pearls a lot. Maybe I got a defective one?"
5,Great Old Time Music,Art Stamper is one of my favorite old time fiddlers and this album is so good that you need to buy it.
5,I liked it very well!,I like old classic tv shows . They always had some kind of moral lesson in them! Wagon train was great! The seller is awesome too!
5,You need this book!,"I have been using this book for the last year. If you are interested in finding an alternative way to treating ailments, this is the book for you."
1,Puzzles but nothing else,"This game is nothing like the magazine reviews. Yes - there is a puzzle in each room to solve. But there is nothing else to explore. You simply solve puzzle after puzzle. There is no other story line. BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. You'd be better off with Myst, Shivers, or some of the Lucas Arts games."
2,Jewel II,The graphics were good but the puzzles were almost the same as in Jewel. It was not very challenging.
4,A comforting place to come home to,My mother has bought me a Christmas book every year since I was born. She writes the year and my age on the first page. She gave me Star Mother when I was eleven and it is a joyous story that I have been returning to for the past thirteen years. When I feel lonely or melancholy I will read it and it always warms up my heart and I can feel the love that all human beings are capable of giving. It's a tremendous example of the universal desire for companionship and love
5,the best Christmas story ever,"From the time my kids were small, we've read this book outloud almost every Christmas Eve - a great story of knowing that there is more to Christmas than lots of presents under the tree."
4,Lovely but little book!,"This is a lovely story and the illustrations are of course beautiful. Hyman just blows me away-- always gorgeous, stunning images!! (If you do not have Hyman's version of Little Red Riding Hood I strongly recommend it. It is a work of art!) The only reason this book is getting four rather than five stars is that it is a really small book, which I was not expecting. You may want to opt for a bigger version. Happy reading!"

5,Another Great One From EJD,"I'm an EJD fan and to me, this was another great novel from him. It was hip, urban, contemporary, and suspensful. A fast paced read written in Dickey's flavorful style. I'd recommend this book to any reader who loves novels that are intriguing and keeps you on the edge of your seat. A definite page turner!"
2,not what i thought,"the book was too long and too boring. I was disapointed and once again felt I wasted my money, the story was just not interesting."
3,Different than Classic EJD!,"I will always support EJD. I love his style of writing. His characters are sometimes wordly, come from a variety of socioeconomic classes, tend to be somewhat eccentric, and go through extreme phases of mental emotion. While his intimate scenes for me are always orgasmic, I did not feel that I was reading classic EJD in Chasing Destiny. While EJD has an excellent way with words, phrases and character development, this one was over the top. I enjoyed this story, was a little disappointed with the ending, but EJD never concludes his stories in a typical manner. EJD, please don't resort to the drama-filled stories that overcrowd our shelves these days. Stay true to your craft and not conform. You always have a supporter here regardless."
5,Great Book,"I have read a little over half of Chasing Destiny and this book is by far my favorite of EJD books. I am really enjoying the way that the story unfolds and the way the characters have this ""six degrees"" type of thing going on. I have also enjoyed the dialogue, especially between Billie and Keith. It's not choppy and really flows and makes sense throughout the story. I can't wait to see what happens at the end just like I couldn't wait to comment of the book!"
1,I was SO disappointed with this book.,"I was SO disappointed with this book. I'm wondering, what happened? Eric used to be such an engaging storyteller. I loved his earlier work. ""Chasing Destiny"" was one of the worst works of fiction that I have ever read. Ever. All of the characters are either weak, mentally unstable, morally corrupt, or just plain crazy. The heroine of the book is trifling, rude, uncouth. I had to literally force myself to continue reading until I finished the book....that's how bad it was. The story was all over the place and so unbelievable. Again I ask......what happened? Eric went from a Zora Neal Hurston type of literary writer (who was a SUPERB storyteller) to a Harlequin Romance type of writer.Yes, the book is REALLY that bad."
2,Changing E.J....,I know nothing about motorcycles but I know a good book when I read one and this one didn't rate high on my list...The only thing that you can count on in life is change and that's what E.J. Dickey has done...seems to me that his whole writing style has evolved almost like he needs a psuedo name or something...all in all EJ is one of my favorites and I'll always purchase his works...Chasing Destiny held a cast of ALL CRAZY MOFOS!!!...that seemed rushed at the end...next....
5,Descriptive Beginning to End,"This book held my attention from the beginning to the end. I enjoyed the way he made me feel I was there. I was on the ride with Billy in every way. I felt her pain, happiness, sorrow, madness and excitement. I love authors who make you feel this way."
3,Started out great ended on a sour note,This book started out great and towards the end it took a awful turn. It seemed EJD was trying to meet a deadline and needed to jot down a quick ending. The ending was so out of touch with reality and the initial flow of the beginning. He jumped all over the place with the story line. I was left with so many unanswered questions. Hope he want try to do a part two
3,"Interesting characters, but...","Note: I'm a white woman in my 30's, and read this book on the stregnth of a review that I read. I liked the story and the writing--you feel like you're in the characters' living rooms--but two things got to me after a while: A) The ending (no spoiler here but it's overdone and B) Except for Ducati, the main character, ALL of the other players in this story are completely unlikeable. You hate them all by the end, and it's a bit of a letdown. Still, it was a fun light read."
4,"Chasing Destiny, found the truth","This is a great book. Very realistic. The characters are people we all know and have made mistakes of which we all are guilty. The main character reminds me of several women I know. The teenager in the book reminds me of myself. EJD creates characters so defined when you put the book down you feel as if you built a relationship with them. I will not give a synopsis of the book because that is unfair. You have to read it to experience bliss. I put my life on hold for a day to step into Eric's mind and when the ride was over I wanted to buy another ticket. This book is my new favorite. Previously I was partial to Sister, Sister because I related well. I would have given Chasing Destiny 5 stars but I wanted a more detailed ending. It is hard to let go sometimes."
2,Chasing Destiny,"Meet Billie - young, pretty, biker babe who is pregnant by a married manMeet Keith - father of Billie's unborn child, pre-divorced husband of Carmen, and father of teenager, DestinyMeet Carmen - Keith's wife, mother of Destiny, nemesis of BillieMeet Destiny - daughter of Carmen and Keith, star of her own wildin' out flick.Now that you know the major players, find a comfortable spot, and read this excruciatingly long story about these truly dysfunctional characters and the events that transpire after Billie meets Keith at Starbucks and tells him she is pregnant.Long and longer. I will admit, I did laugh out loud at some of the dialogue at the beginning, but as I read further, laughter turned into frowns and I just wanted to finish this. It wasn't a bad book, just too long and too neatly tied up at the end for my taste. Get it from the library."
2,Lot's of drama and lots of sex,"This is not my favorit EJD book. The drama and high antics were superb, but the content and the characters were mean, selfish and sad. Fiction is generally based on facts, but I'd hate to know any of the damn near middle age folks acting the way they act in this story. Too much was unbelieveable for me or I just don't know people that stupid. I love EJD earlier work, but this did not do it for me. Chasing Destiny was not bad, but it was not good."
1,Its Not Up To Par,"Dickey's books have been way better than this, i was kinda disappointed when i read this book. It was to jumpy and the plot of the story wasn't really all that good."
4,Interesting,Not my normal genre. First time reading this author. Loaned to my because of the motorcycle subplot. I enjoyed the way the storylines intersected. The brick changing hands was humorous to me. I wish there was a little more closure at the end but I understand the open ended concept. Overall I enjoyed it greatly after getting thru the first 1/3 of the book. I actually felt bad for the father and daughter. Tough position to be in.
3,To Much!,"Either I'm too old for this kind of read, or this is way too much violence and drama. I did like the dialog between Billy and Keith."
3,Not as Good as Previous Work,"I'm a huge fan of Mr. Dickey, but this one left me a little disappointed. The title is ""Chasing Destiny"" and not much of that happened. If it is the title of the book you would think the book would be about the title character but it isn't. The narrator of the story is Billie, and it is all about her and her motorcycle. I learned a lot more about motorcyles than I wanted to I must say. I see if Destiny was running away on a motorcycle but that still wasn't the case. All I can say was I was confused didn't know where he was going in this novel.Anyway the character Destiny barely has a chapter where we as the reader gets into her head. Although I was curious to find out what happens to the characters in the end, I just couldn't get into this novel as I have previous ones. But as usual I look forward to the next one."
5,EXCELLENT!!!,Dickey has done it again. This is a great book. Although it's longer than his normal style..it's a page turner and you can't put it down. This book ended as if there will be a continuation. It was alomost like a movie where you are waiting to see if there will be a part-2. Dickey has become my FAVORITE author. I can't wait for the next book.Good JOB!
3,Falling in love with wrong guy is the least of her problems,Billie finds out she's pregnant by her married lover Keith. Keith has a surprise of his own that he is moving back in with his wife Carmen. Billie's life spins out of control trying to get a handle on what's happening. Keith does not want her out of life but is unwilling to compromise the relationship with his daughter Destiny. Destiny's life is spinning out of control when she tries living a life she's not prepared for. Things get crazy between Carmen and Billie. Billie figures out that Carmen is not the only one after her. There are too many characters stories told at once and no one you can really root for. The ending is bothersome because there are too many loose ends left un-resolved. Taken as a whole it was an engaging novel but leaves you a bit disappointed in the end.
3,Just OK for me..,"I would really love EJD's books so much more if I could stand the speech of his characters. His books just have waay too many sentences with no subjects! What happened to ""I"" or ""We"". No one I know talks like that. I have at least started to read all of his books, because his story lines & characters are so interesting. Some I've gotten all the way through & some I have not. But over 400 pages of 1 & 2 word sentences did me in on this one. I'm just not a true fan of his writing style I guess."
2,Disappointed,"I usually LOVE Eric's books, but I was very disappointed in this one. It seemed that he was trying to be like another author in writing this book. If you like Zane, you'll like this one. If not don't bother!"
4,"EJD, you've done it again...","EJD, you got me thinking of buying a motorcycle. LOLWell-written, charismatic, sexy (of course), and never predictable. These are givens for a EJD book and Chasing Destiny was no different.Love the twists and connections in the book. Small word indeed. LOL.Another winner.Thank you EJD."
4,Not one single boring moment.,"I picked this book up and could not put it down. I have read all of Eric Jerome Dickey's novels and I am never diappointed. The characters were intriguing and the story pulled me in so much that I found myself actually angree, frustrated and happy with every twist and turn. A true page turner."
4,CARZY READ,"this book by far may have been one of the craziest books i've ever read....EJD did a great job with the characters and secene descripstions......the whole time i was reading the book i could visualize everything in my mind.....from jump street, Billie was my homegirl.....i loved her style and the way she took care of business.....not gonna say too much because i dont want to give it away to people thathavent read the book yet but i wanted to knock out everybody in carmen's family, especially lil' destiny.....i do have to admit though.....i was a little disappointed with the ending....well alot dissappointed.......at first i was falling of the cliff and then he just let me hit the ground dead on.....over0all though....the book was good....i enjoyed it didnt want to put it down"
5,Very good read.,I just finished reading Chasing Destiny and as usual Eric Jerome Dickey didn't disappoint. This book is so good. I literally could not put it down until it was finished!
1,He's lost it.,"I rented this book froma library b/c I refused to buy it after like his last 4 novels all sucked. And this one wasn't much better. I could not finish it, I do not like his style of writing, he drags the speech out and it is annoying to me. I liked his old stuff Milk in My coffee, Cheaters, Lover & Friends and so on but in the past 5 years I don't know what has happened."
5,Love It,I was so into this book that it was crazy. I woke up in the morning reading it and went to bed reading it. A couple of times I had to force myself to close the book just to get some rest. There were so many twists and turns that I was left shaking my head. It ended kinda of abrupt - is there a sequel lurking. Keep up the good work
4,Differnt than his usual but a page turner,"This book is still not like his books before Genevive but it is Very, very good. You will not be able to put it down."
1,"Awful,Awful, Awful",I have no idea how anyone got through this mess. I think EJD has definitely hit a sour streak.
2,Chasing Destiny by Eric Jerome Dickey,"Two words,,, ""Get-Toe"" Once again Black America shows its Lack of style, and insight. Good story but still basic ""Get-Toe"" tales that direct what little reading skills ""we"" as a people have from reading something we can learn from instead. And this is what ""we"" harp on as quality reading. Black America we keep going down this road and besides trying to learn english , we will have to learn Spanish."
2,Just OK,"This book was just okay for me. The story line dragged on and just got plain boring. The whole scene with Carmen and Billie at Carmen's house was too melodramatic to say the least. Also, EJD, there were just too many typos in this one. I find that very irritating. Soooo glad I borrowed this from the library."
1,"Awful, just awful!","Oh my goodness, do the conversations ever end in this book? The entire story has been one long, pointless conversation after another. I usually really enjoy EJD's books but this one is terrible. I am nearly 100 pages in and we are still on the first day of the story and going nowhere quick - I keep reading hoping it will get better but I am starting to think there's no hope. Sorry to say it, but this is one I won't be finishing. Hopefully EJD will look back at some of his older works and take a cue to return to that writing style...please!"
4,scary book,"I did not like the ending, but I enjoyed the book. It was scary for me though I hope our people do not really act this way, and I am scared we do. Doping, raping, lying, cheating, selfish and lost. Eric talked about these character in depth through the whole book and then there was just ""the end"". Save the graphic details we can get the point with sexual innuendo only-save the extra nasty for Zane (one of her books was enough for me)"
5,OUTSTANDING,"THIS BOOK WAS GREAT. I HAVE READ ALMOST ALL EJD BOOKS, BUT I MISSED THIS ONE, AND I LOVED IT. THIS IS A MUST GET, THEN AGAIN YOU CANT GO WRONG WITH EJD."
2,predictable,"HO-HUM. Motorcycle tough chick, (Billie) meets harried, married man (Keith). He whines and complains that his wife doesn't understand him. She's an orphan and he fills the void in her life. Enter his jealous wife, (Carmen) and his brat of a daughter,(Destiny),and his crazy in-laws. Nice sex play between the Billie and Keith. Carmen, the jealous wife is over the top and little Destiny is a spoiled brat with little home training. Throw in some street violence, best friend drama and tears. It took me over 2 months to finish this book. It seemed like a TV soap opera, of which I'm not a fan of. Better to get it at the library or a used book store. Sorry EDJ. For me, gone are the days when EDJ held my interest with Sister, Sister, Milk in My Coffee, Liar's Game, Cheaters, even Geneieve. I wish he'd go back to his old style."
3,STORY A LITTLE SHORT,I UNDERSTOOD WHERE HE WAS TRYING TO GO WITH THE STORY HE JUST NEVER REALLY GOT THERE TO ME. IT WAS OKAY BUT I WAS A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED
1,Pass on this one.,"Had to buy this for a client/server program and it stinks. After taking a couple of HTML courses at a community college, I find it's easier to code from scratch than use this."
1,you should have 0 star option,"Web design is my hobby and my job. I got to use many many different editors but at the end one is the most productive with EditPad. On ocasion I try a new product si\o I gave a shot to FP. It is good for nothing. If you want WYSIWYG buy Macromedia's Dreamweaver. Bottom line with FP is that pages it creates can't be seen. It is not so big issue finding server willing to host FP extensions, but you are making your pages unavailable to Netscape users, and everyone else not using Internet Explorer. Begginer or profesional FP is mot good for you!"
1,Another lousy product from MS,"Don't waste your money on this, while it looks appealing and can create pages quickly, there are better alternatives available. Some complaints...First if you decide to use themes Microsoft will allow you to edit the HTML code and then wipe it out even if you tell it to preserve the HTML source. Another issue I have is bringing a pre-existing page into Frontpage, I've had numerous problems with frontpage wiping out the code and saving a bad copy. Save yourself the frustration and buy Macromedia's Dreamweaver instead."
1,Do not buy - very limited,"Front page has some good features - i admit it. But it is limited. The WYSIWYG interface is feeble and hard to use. The wizard has a lot of limitations. The html looks scattered and unlike much better products such as Homesite - most feeatures only appear in Internet Explorer. I used the wizard to put background music - although the code is only VALID in Internet Explorer. This is another attempt by Microsoft to make thier products dominate the market. When html codes are entered, and the user tried to verify them - sometimes MSFP2000 says it is valid - but when I press preivew - there is an html scrip error on the page. All the verify command does is check if it has an open <...> and a close </...>. Sometimes - it doesn't even do THAT."
3,FrontPage 2000,"It's extremely easy to use if you're looking to create very simple sites, but I'm still getting to know the program. I've always built sites strictly with code, and I thought this could expedite some work, but the learning curve is taking a little longer than anticipated."
5,Can't see it any other way...,"After having worked through the agonies of hand-coding HTML, Front Pange (and the back-end Access interface) has made my life tremendously easier. The approach is structured, and reduces the complexities of web publishing to a few button clicks.I have designed 4 sites with Front Page, and would not change from this program. An excellent tool an value for the money. Anti-trust or not, this program is one that I will keep in my personal tool-belt for a long time."
1,No improvement over FP98,"Microsoft has taken a promising product here - they didn't code the original version, but purchased it - and turned it into a Microsoft-centric, clunky application.Look, it isn't the Web if everything is dominated by Microsoft ""standards."" And that is the main problem with this software. Yes, it works, but one doesn't even know how bad the code is until one learns something about HTML.THere are better freeware editors floating around, like Nano and even Netscape Composer."
3,What Frontpage 98 should have been,"I used FrontPage 98 daily and was glad to see FP2000. However, although it has the Windows 2000 interface it feels like using Office 97. It still has the same annoying bugs in and importing HTML files is a nightmare as FP goes and changes all the code for you. There is no advanced features - It is your basic webpage editer. The templates are not brilliant but at least editing is easier now with the standard Office toolbars. Forget about animation though and 'cool' looking pages. The best thing about it is the organisation of files. You can move pages and get the links updated etc. and there are tools to see broken links. Editing wise it is very basic. So it is excellant for beginners. Dreamwaver is the package of choice here but FP2000 is definitely an improvement on FP98. I just wish FP2000 came out 2 years ago cos it already looks aged"
1,Do Not Buy This Product,Micrsoft makes some great products; However this is not one of them. The way the program works does not allow 50-80% of web users to see the page propertly. If you want people to be able to use your pages do not use this product. Try Hot Metal or Netscape Composer.
2,Front Page is mediocre.,"If you are looking for a software package to get started with creating web pages, try Adobe GoLive. Although MS Front Page has some nice features, you will find that you will soon want to expand beyond it.This program is very limiting!"
1,Never learned how to play with the other kids...,"Typical Microsoft, never learned how to play with the other kids on the block. There is so much proprietary code (i.e. crap) added to your web page that serves only to slow down load time, and make your web pages incompatible with Netscape viewers. So ask yourself - do you really want to make your website inaccessible to Netscape viewers? By doing so, you may be losing 3-4 out of 10 visitors. Not a good idea. Frontpage is perhaps a good for the entry level software for the novice, but experienced hand coders will probably uninstall it the same day they install it. So don't bother."
4,Great if you want to get a site up and running quickly,"I was able to get a functional website up and running in an afternoon with Frontpage -- it is very intuitive and easy to use. It is even useful if you subsequently graduate to more complex software, like Dreamweaver, because you can establish the basic site with Frontpage and then edit the HTML with Dreamweaver to add further bells and whistles. No regrets at all, with this purchase."
4,Great for Beginning Web Designers,"Microsoft Front Page 2000 is great for anyone just beginning to design personal web pages. It is also practical for more advanced use as well, but I feel it is better suited for smaller website design projects. It is very easy to cut, paste, arrange, and redesign existing web pages with FrontPage. FrontPage will allow even the newest beginner to website design to put together exciting web pages without even knowing how to use HTML code, although a basic knowledge of the HTML language would be helpful and can be learned through trial and error use with FrontPage. (Note: For anyone looking for the most up to date version of FrontPage, FrontPage 2002 is due out from Microsoft later this year.)"
3,Good for starters---Bad For advanced users,"I have been using Frontpage for several years now. When I first began using the product I loved it. It was so easy to use, especialy for me who had no prior web experience. I was able to create great looking web pages with ease. For those who have used any Microsoft Office product you will find this software very similar. Yet, now as I demand more advanced features I find Frontpage lacking. For instance I added Frontpage hover buttons to my web site. These buttons worked great with only some browsers. It caused many browsers to bring up many errors. Also many times I had cannot get the web site to look just right. It will look fine in the Frontpage editor yet after it is published it looks completely different. My solution was to switch to Dreamweaver 3. Dreamweaver is just as easy to use yet adds many more features...."
1,Beware the 40 dollar rebate !!!,"When a company offers a ""rebate"" for buying their product, they should mean just that...REBATE....no strings attached (except proof of purchase, of course).Some marketing genius at Microsoft has devised a way not to pay the rebate unless you have documentation and bar codes from other MS products books & boxes from years ago. Since we can't find all that crap to send in for a rebate, they tell us ""tuff"" !!We feel confident that... would not sell this decptive form af advertizing if they knew about it. We would have purchased another program, had we known what a hassle it would be to get our ""rebate""...which we aren't getting.Some ""rebate"", huh guys ?!?!?!"
1,FP 2000 is a tease,"My experience with this software has been exasperating... It write buggy java code, creates forms which can only be used inside the FP framework, and creates html that is very overloaded with extraneous text (read: longer downloads). Finally, you are forced to use a hosting service which provides special extensions. The purpose for these could be accomplished in standard ways, but MS has choosen to introduce security holes and extra costs by forcing this on its users.... I would use almost anything before using this product."
5,"Sorry, FP is better","My computer was so messed up that FP was a nightmare. I was trying to run the program without reading the installation requirements. Web managers that I use to edit HTML were not giving me errors.After I read some of the book (and had a friend fix my PC) it's remarable how cool FP performs.Obviously, the negative comments on FP are written by other novice web developers. Be patinet, read the book and you won't be dissapointed."
1,Save Your Money,"If you can find a host site that supports MS extensions, it will probably cost you money. Otherwise you have to upload with FTP. Even then, it's still a pain to work with.If you don't believe me, try uploading a MS FrontPage web page on Geocities, for example. Good luck!"
4,Great For The Casual User,"This software is wonderful for those individuals looking to put together a quick, adequate site without any programming. Bear in mind, however, that some functionality, such as Java Script, is often difficult. Also, to utilize such features as search, feedback forms, etc., you will need to find a server that supports FrontPage Extensions. I have mastered the program, but find it exteremely powerful for someone not all that interested in being bogged down with html code."
1,Buy DreamWeaver instead,"Don't buy this product. The html Frontpage creates is so buggy and difficult to maintain that tt is better to buy a book and do straight html coding. DreamWeaver is a superior product. Take it from me, I am a senior consultant at a major computer science consulting firm, and we had nothing but headaches when we used Frontpage."
2,Frustrating!,"I have created a couple of websites using Front Page, and they have been nothing but trouble. As one reviewer said, you put stuff in one place, and it moves itself somewhere else. My only remedy to this, was to put every single thing on my page in a table. That was the only way my sites looked right. Also, when you publish your web, you can't just publish the pages you changed (that screws everything up) so you have to publish everything, everytime you change your site. I wanted to love Front Page, because it is easy to use, and I love avoiding straight HTML programming. However, it's ease of use does not make up for the problems that fill every nook of this program. If you are a novice programmer, or just want to use it to make a personal website, use Front Page, if you need something hi tech, look elsewhere."
1,Great for Newbies,"Frontpage is great if you live in a MS bubble. You need not any knowledge of programming or development. For true web beginners that never want to learn how the internet works this is your ""pay dirt"". What You See is What You Get (WYSIWYG), that's all folks. If you ever plan to learn real HTML, JavaScript, XML, DHTML, PHP, or if your wesite requires any kind of good database connectivity, forget MS Frontpage. If your into designing and developing dynamically generated websites or e-commerce enabled websites, look elsewhere. I would suggest taking a look at the free demo version of HomeSite 4.5 before you pad Mr. Gates pockets. What's with all the ""vti"" folders anyway, why can't they just use FTP like the rest of the world..."
4,An excellent HTML editor for seasoned users!,"This HTML editor is very good, except that it seems to throw in defaults instead of letting one choose their own ""FORM ACTION"" control. I personally created a church website with Microsoft's Publisher 2000, then tweaked it up with FrontPage 2000, since FP has more goodies to offer than Publisher!So folks . . . I recommend both: Microsoft's Publisher to first create your design and layout of your website, save in HTML format then use Microsoft's FrontPage to add stuff that Publisher leaves out!"
2,Handle with EXTREME caution,"While many aspects of FrontPage2000 are very easy to use, and while I feel it is an upgrade over FP98 in many, many ways, the glitches remain, and are difficult to correct (when correction is even possible).Too often closing tags are left out, the automatic META tags are a pain, and the program is so IE-centric that it can be very difficult to create a page that looks correct in other browsers (especially Netscape).If you are able to repair HTML code, it's a decent tool. If you are doing a corporate intranet site and don't have to worry about Netscape users, it's fine. But if you are publishing for the web, don't be surprised to find yourself a bit frustrated by some of the program's anomalies."
2,The Reviews are true,"I have to agree with most of the posts - which I initially ignored. After designing some nice pages with image maps etc., I was unable to upload to the server. Once I hand FTPed the files, none of them worked in Netscape. I uninstalled FP2000 and have started using Hotmetal. It has a better interface, and the exact same page designs work flawlessly in both IE and Netscape. It's cheaper too."
5,A New Twist to Add,"I just read ""Starting Something"" for the second time - this time more closely-- and truly enjoyed it. Wayne did a great job giving the personal feeling of the environment. It meant a lot to me since I was with Neoforma from early 1998 to present (2006)! I lived through many portions of what Wayne and Jeff did, and as I read the book I enjoyed transforming many of the pseudonyms to the real people I had interacted with in those early years.One important new twist is how NEOF has just recently been bought by the healthcare manufacturer consortium (GHX) which was originally set up to compete/crush it!I highly recommend Starting Something to all next generation entrepreneurs, as well as former entrepreneurs - all of those who were in the world wind of power, money and control of that era.Anil Singhal, MD"
4,Good Start Up Story,"This is a good example of a start up and how much work is involved. By highlighting the ups and downs, it paints the real picture of a start-up, not just the glam."
4,Entrepreneurial Understanding,"This book covers many aspects of the entrepreneurial process. Written in a journal-style, the book takes on more the form of a dramatic novel, covering the growth of McVicker's company, Neoforma, from their beginnings as a poor internet start-up, all the way to their IPO. McVicker navigates through the convoluted process of starting this business, and provides a tremendous amount of insight into his experiences. The names in the book take on life as McVicker describes them interacting in the start-up process. Well written and packed with information, this is a good read for anyone interested in starting their own business."
1,Preachy,"I bought this book because I am always looking for hints to help me help my ADHD husband become more organized. This book was more about Regina Leeds than about organizing. And she characterized those with ADD/ADHD as ""lazy"" which demonstrated her enormous ignorance. I tossed it into the recycling bin."
1,Disappointed,"I had read the 1 year to an organized life, by Ms Leeds, I thought this was going to be different. It's the exact same book!! I recommend buying the newer version: 1 year to an organized life, don't waste money on this one."
3,"Great, but need to adapt to your situation","The author notes that most of her clients have assistants and/or housekeepers. I have neither, but am my own in both cases. I did find the book inspirational, though not a read from cover to cover. I'm flipping through several organizational/clutter buster books at one time."
5,Zen delivered...,"The Zen of Organizing: Creating Order and Peace in Your Home, Career and Life is one of the first organizing books that I have read that made sense and that actually made a difference in my life. The book has resulted in my creating more peace (zen) not only within my home, but also within my life. The author, through her suggestions and stories, helped me to identify solutions and provided insight to my organizing. Ms. Leeds' inspirational approach to organizing has assisted me in getting organized and staying organized.If you are looking for lasting changes...Give yourself a gift and get this book."
3,Disappointing,"I bought this book on the strength of the reader reviews here hoping that it would make a good gift for a friend of mine whose home is a fire hazard, it is so cluttered with more than a decade of junk that she cannot throw away. However, the first chapter that would have been relevant to her needs deals with... how to keep your files straight! My gosh, for someone who is in great need of organizing help, that is one of the last matters to address. I found some of the examples in the book parochial and off-putting - who outside of LA and New York City spends $1,500 on a dinner party for six other couples?! And who in the world told Ms. Leeds that the purpose of a mezuzah for Jews is to ward off evil? That is absolutely ill-informed and incorrect. She should have checked that information out before printing it. In sum, you might find this book helpful if you are slightly to moderately disorganized. If you are nearly hopeless at keeping your life in order, this book will not help a bit."
1,Simply Awful,"I've seen some really bad movies in my time, but this mess takes the cake. I work at a theatre and I get free movies, so one nite, to waste some time, I decided to check this out. I sat there stunned at how bad this is..everything about it is terrible. Not sure who the Director of photography was, but this thing has a weird look to it..cheap and bad. If you are a fan of bad movies, you gotta see this for a laugh..I don't remember a whole lot, but I do remember something about the main character having powers and she made these lobsters talk or something..bad memories, man. Must be seen to be believed."
2,Flannery blows this out of the water,they couldve gotten a better actor then Sean Patrick Flannery..he ruins the movie leaving a bad taste..hes so annoying..his character is dislikable....Gellar is beautiful and ravishing..she's purdy hot..id love to eat her food if you know what I mean..high 5
4,Fantasy-comedy romance,"Ah Sean Patrick Flanery is gorgeous [and has gotten better with age as Hollywood men tend to do], and Sarah Michelle Gellar has come such a long way since this movie. I love the fantasy aspect of it; that all things are possible if you just really want it badly enough; and I love the relationship side of it - from his point of view, it's honest and well acted. They make a lovely couple on screen; the supporting actors are all outstanding - the Auntie drinking on the job; the quirky PA obsessed with Jonathan... it's just a great little movie."
5,Hungry for love anyone?,"I have been looking for this movie for so long, i was so excited for this purchase, I thank you for it. I received it in no time, and hope to shop with you again."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A thoroughly off-the-wall film that some will find beguiling but I found a failure, Simply Irristible offers a lot of whimsy (e.g. magical crabs, people floating in midair) but not a lot of substance; I applaud the film for not following convention or formula, but it just doesn't really work no matter how hard it tries."
3,Modern fairy tale,"Young restaurant owner Amanda (Gellar) is a bad cook. So bad that her restaurant is almost out of business. But everything changes when she meets a strange man selling cancers at a market. Amanda isnt the same any more: suddenly, she can cook fantastic things, the guests love her restaurant again and smart store-manager Tom (Flanery) can't resist Amanda....This movie isn't a masterpiece, but it's quite good. I liked the story, which is told like a fairy tale, the nice pictures and the good soundtrack. Nevertheless, something's missing. It's not Sarah Michelle's fault though. She IS simply irresistible.A nice little movie worth watching."
2,entertaining but shallow,"This movie is about a young, not very talented female cook who finds a magic crab which makes all her food go magic. She falls in love with a man who is about to open an expensive high society restaurant. Her magic foods makes him fall in love with her but also frightens him. The film is all about the food. Its not evena love story between the two main characters, its a love story tocaramel and vanilla. Its probably nice to look on xmas evening, you can miss large parts of the movie without missing essentials of the plots because there are none. I like the crab. I didnt like the actors they were all just to anxious to make magic fitting into the 21st century.You might like this movie if you are very into cooking. I would recommend you look Chocolat instead, it has much much more charme and quality."
2,Like Water for Buffy,"The whole way through, I kept on thinking, this is sooo *Like Water for Chocolate*, a far better tale of the magic of cooking. There is one scene almost IDENTICAL (a tear in the food causes everyone to cry). I thought about whether it was a homage or a rip-off, and decided it was a rip-off. That movie used magic realism; this one simply uses magic. And not that the magic makes any sense. Where'd it come from? Who knows? There's this cute wittle crab that serves no purpose. The romance is contrived and rather unoriginal. It doesn't offer too much in the way of entertainment. At least by the end of the movie, I had stopped seeing Sarah Michelle Gellar solely as Buffy (she is very Buffylike in the beginning). There is also a very sweet camera shot involving lots of mirrors that is the best shot in the entire movie. Overall, a mediocre movie that doesn't ever rise above...anything. Well, except the floor, in a couple scenes involving that ""magic."""
4,Cute romantic comedy,"Sarah Michelle Gellar is really irrestible in this romantic movie, but the movie is too predictable and some of the actors could do better. But the main characters are good especially Amanda Shelton (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and Nolan Traynor (Larry Gilliard Jr.) are doing a great job.I'll give it 4 stars, even though the movie isn't long-lasting to see more than a couple of times, I'm just a big fan of Sarah Michelle Gellar."
4,vanilla fog,"Sarah workes her magic in this could be better movie.. the plot had its weak spots, the dialogue left a little to be desired.. the acting was in a word, superb.. Sarah has always had a bewitching way of drawing me to the theatre.. i went to ""scream 2"" 4 times, ""cruel intentions"" 6 times, and ""i know what you did last summer"" 3 times.. this movie however, once at 6.75 was enough.. if you love sarah, watch it for kicks.. if you like sean patrick flannery.. Skip it.. not his best attempt.. overall a decent piece of cinematic celluloid.."
2,Simply Not Sarah's finest,"Well, believe me, I am the biggest Sarah fan in the entire world. But this is not her type of movie. The storyline made no sense. I rented this, and then I watched it when it came on HBO to try to figure it out more, but NO. I couldnt. The only funny part is her friend Nolan in the movie. So that is all I got to say about that."
2,It Actually Is Fairly Irresistible,"This movies plot may seem corny to you when you read the blurb, and in fact it is. Scenes in which food and Sarah Michelle Gellar fly around a kitchen all with love in the air is not my idea of a great idea for a film. The movie has its slightly entertaining moments, but once you get past those, this film is simply dry and quite resistable."
2,Resistible for All but the Biggest SMG Fan,Even a wonderful actress like Sarah Michelle Gellar is only as good as the writing. I'm a huge fan of SMG but this movie is barely watchable and then only if you enjoy looking at Sarah. The writing is stiff and the plot defies the suspension of disbelief. I'm buying it but only because of Sarah.
4,Plain Truth,"This is a funny, delightful, movie, showing your possibilities; if you have the strength to hang in there through the down times long enough. The plot was well thought out & the actors, many whom I've seen in other films did a great job. I applaud them.Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Season 5"
4,Sarah Michelle Dream!,Devoted fans of Sarah should love this movie. Yes it's kind of corny and the script has a few holes in it but Sarah like usual makes you feel for her character. Beautiful romantic ending brought a tear to my eye. I also loved the dance sequence when I could see many reflections of Sarah across the screen.
5,Tasty!,"I loved this movie! Sean Patrick Flannery is a *doll*, and Sarah Michelle Gellar is one of those rare actresses that can pull off a romantic comedy without coming across as excessively loopy."
5,a great sarah film that screams cute,i really injoyed this movie because sarah michelle did a great job at potaring her character and all in all the movie is just well cute!
4,Light But Lovely,"I skipped this one at theater and the rental store... until I saw it on cable. Sarah Michelle Geller really won my heart as the struggling chef. I cried right along with her when things seemed to go so wrong. I think what pulled it together for me was the smooth soundtrack and the use of color to denote the differences in Geller's and Flanery's lives. If you are looking for intense drama, skip this. But if you want something to tickle your senses and just leave you feeling a little more light hearted, pick it up."
3,a sweet nothing,"i am a great fan of B grade movies - you can watch them over and over and there's no strain. simply irresistible is a lovely little b grade movie - very flawed but very sweet and sometimes that's what makes the world go around for me - so if that works for you then you'll enjoy this little romance movie. sarah michelle is the weak link, she's pretty but pouts too much to be taken seriously in a grown up movie. the support players are fantastic and very very funny. - like the desserts her character makes this film is light, sweet and enjoyable (and i'm sure not very filling) but be careful you need to mix up some serious somethings and not have too much of a diet of sweet nothings like this one. watch enjoy forget and then enjoy again. Aileen in the land of Oz."
1,"So, so, so BAD","Worst movie i have ever seenTHERE IS A MAGIC CRAB eh, this movie is terrible so bad please dont get it i urge you"
1,"""You think with your nuts""","Magically unfunny movie that someone sold their soul to get made. If you decide to watch this (I'm praying for you) be sure to purchase some leeches beforehand. After you are through enduring this ""movie"" you will apply the leeches to your eyes so that the evil can be sucked out of them. Beware, this is the second sign of the Apocalypse."
1,They Suck!! No stars!!,"I still haven't received my dvd. They have not replied to my emails requesting to know where the dvd is and I still haven't rcv it, its been over one month. They took my money and I still can't get an email response or the dvd."
3,Sarah Michelle Gellar is Irresistible!,"I loved Sarah Michelle Gellar since her beginnings with Buffy, and this movie is not bad too. This movie is your normal chick flick but with SMG's charms it's even better. Anways it's not bad if you wanna watch a movie thats not too much."
4,I WANT TO RETRACT MY OTHER REVIEW! THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE!,"I wrote an earlier review, saw it on cable, and didn't find anything special about it. well, i watched it for a second time, and taped it, and it actually was good. maybe this is one of movies you need to see more than once before you decide whether you like it or not, if that makes any sense! it is a cute little romantic comedy, it has a very fairy tale like quality about it. i would now recommend it! smg is smashing!"
5,This movie is intoxicating.,"I watched this movie not because i wanted to, i don't even like Sarah, it was the only thing i was in time to see. i GREATLY underjudged it. it was amazing. it made me feel wonderful throughout, and strangely touched when i left. i would recomend everyone to see it if they have a chance."
4,"Lighthearted, easy watching for SMG fans","I took my middleaged self and my fourteen year old twin nieces (very intent Buffy fans),to see this movie at the theater. We loved it! Nothing too heavy, no cringe inducing sex scenes! It was great! There's a terrific soundtrack too.We wanted to see it at the theater again, but unfortunately, not enough people felt the way we did. Glad to see Amazon shoppers liked it too!"
3,A Magical-romantic suprising film,"Simply Irresistible another film for Sarah Michelle Gellar,whose last film Cruel Intenstions did pretty well,but this small talk comedy is a fresh approach to SMG acting career,it's a pleasant delight to watch and a great date film if you want an unbelievable story out of no where."
3,Simply Irresistible,I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD and would recommend it to anyone who likes quirky love stories that are fun to watch.
5,Cute movie,"This was a gift for my sister. We both loved it and recommend it as a ""girls movie night"" selection."
2,Irresistible,I lost interest in this movie right from the start. I kept hoping it would get better but ended up just ejecting it before it finished.
5,Is the best,"Simply Irristable is the most beautifulest movie I've seen in a long time. See it and you'll know what I mean. Relax and let the magic take you, for it will."
3,Okay,"I watched this with friends and liked it OK. It was a little boring but it kept our attention. Sarah has done much better films since this, tho. Probably wouldn't watch it again."
3,A RECIPE FOR LOVE,This is a movie that manages to lift up your heart and put you in a good mood. It has a certain charm to it-unlike many movies that are being made today. You grow to like all the characters. And you just know how the end will turn out-they have to get together! But it's what happens in between that has the OLD BLACK MAGIC to it. IT REALLY IS SIMPLY IRRESISTABLE!
1,Park your body and put your brain in neutral.....,"My husband and I were on vacation. We were tired and hungry from a mall outing, and decided to go where it was cool, and rest and snack on popcorn. WELL, that was the only reason that we stuck it out in this movie. Dumb and corny; the jokes weren't even funny. In fact, while the credits at the beginning were still coming on, we knew we were in trouble. But what the hay, we got to rest for an hour. I wouldn't waste my time on watching it again at home."
4,A cute fairy tale,"I thought this movie was really cute, with bits of magic and fairy tale elements. (although the crab was kind of odd) All in all, I liked it. Then again, I have always been a sucker for a good romance."
1,Terrible,"This has to be one of the worst movies ever. I am so glad it never became popular and flopped because it deserved to. After I saw it on HBO, all I could think about was ""What the hell was that?"" I have liked some bad movies before and I usually don't hate a movie, but this is truely aweful. Only see it if you are a fan of Sarah Michelle Gellar, even then I think you should skip it for fear of hating her for making such a terrible movie."
1,I laughed so hard.....at how bad it was!,"Sorry to those who liked it,but I (a TOTAL romantic comedy lover) thought this was the STUPIDEST plot for a movie. A movie about a magical crab???? Was this serious? I honestly could not get passed the crab to even attempt to take the rest of the movie seriously. The actors were good, as they usually are in their roles, but this crab just made it laughable. I am actually shocked at how many people liked it. Not being sarcastic, just really surprised. My sister and I rented it and were just belly laughing through the whole thing about the crab. We still joke about it as the worst movie we have ever seen. She's a total independent and foreign film junkie. I am a romantic comedy/ big american production type fan. Both of us agreed on this. It was just a really bad premise."
3,If only they had cast Freddie Prinze Jr.,I thought Sean Patrick Flannery was too caddish to be believable as a foil for Sarah Michelle Gellar. She's very pretty in this movie but I found the movie awkward to watch. I think casting Freddie Prinze Jr. as a ruthless serial monogamist would have been a brave yet successful choice because the actor has the sensitivity and range to play a cold character that can still be believable as Sarah Michelle Gellar's love interest. Fans of The Wire will enjoy seeing The Greek and D'Angelo in the cast.
2,simply another picture,"It's okay, but I wouldn't see it twice. It was entertaining, but their acting is not very good and you can tell right away it's never going to win an award."
4,down with critics,"After reading several poor critical reviews, I didn't see this movie in a theatre. But, after watching it in DVD video, I was enchanted by this wonderful feel good romantic movie. SMG's ability to invest characters with real emotions is a terrific attribute. The movie is a fantasy that didn't always make literal sense, but who cares! That is the definition of a fantasy. Even Will Shakespeare had his fantasy plays. Again, I say down with the critics."
2,Never Really Took Off :-(,"This movie was what you would call a ""cutsie"" movie. It had ideas and jokes intended to make an elementary schooler laugh. (some things are said in this movie thought that are not at all appropriate for a person of that age) The acting was not great, and the mood was what you would call weird. It was not funny or entertaining but it had a one or two okay parts. I would not recommend this movie if you like movies with an intense plot, edge -of-your-seet drama or good acting. Watch this movie ONLY if you have nothing else to do."
5,Food For thought,"A film that you either love or hate; it is a wonderful fairy tale like romantic drama. I found this film whilst flicking through the channels and loved it. It is a magical story about true love, with adorable scenes that involve food, true love, and dancing. It is what dreams of true love are made of and is a film for the romantically inclined."
1,don't watch this!,"even if you like farie tales, this may test your threshold for pain; a horrible fantasy that rips off ""Like Water for Chocolate"" and feels like a lead weight after ingestion; very cloying and devoid of much-needed whimsy, it's like watching a clown trying to dance with cement shoes."
1,Someone please kill me.,"That's exactly what my friends and I were saying while viewing this movie, trapped inside the movie theater. Gellar finds a magical crab who makes her able to cook. Then a guy loves the food. They float around the room for no paticular reason and there is nothing funny about this movie, especially when you have to sit through it. Worst film of 99. Reviewers hated it. Everyone in the theater screamed out insults. The TV times gave it 1 star (lowest possible). Enough said."
4,A Sweet Film!,"""Simply Irrestible"" is a sweet fairy tale-style movie that has plenty of romance and fantasy. This film revolves around a wannabe chef (Sarah Michelle Gellar) who inherits a restaurant from her decesased mother. Amanda cannot cook to save her life, but with the help of a fairy godmother-type, she is able to serve delectable dishes, winning over the hearts of the public as well as a handsome restauranteur played by Sean Patrick Flannery. This movie will definitely have you thinking about love and all the great things that come along with it. I would suggest this film to anyone who would like to watch a sweet, romantic film!!!!p.s. I'm still trying to get my hands on some caramel eclairs!!!"
4,Cute Fairy Tale Romance...,"Very cute fairy tale romance film with a happy ending. And I do mean fairy tale...From the magical crab salesman at the open market to the mysterious effects of the food cooked and I loved the jumbo crab!! This movie doesn't have any serious messages, great oscar winning performances or ect....but it is a nice light hearted movie to watch while relaxing."
3,Shoud be made of rubber...,"This item is made of a tough, hard plastic. Because of its size, a dog has a very hard time getting a bite on it. The boxer this product was intended for liked to push it around with his nose and seem to have much fun with it. Here is the problem: after playing with it, his nose and gums were bleeding from the agressive pushing and bopping of the ball. You could hear him smash his face against the plastic ball. Ouch! The ball will last a long time against hyper dogs. But be aware that your dog will sustain a bloody nose and mouth. Not good for home with nice carpeting."
2,Indestructible but causes bloody noses!,"I bought both a 14"" and 6"" jolly ball for my German Shepherd Dogs who love to herd. I was hoping for a toy less susceptible to chewing than a standard basketball. Although these balls are indestructible, pushing them caused both of my dogs to get bloody noses. Their muzzles were bleeding, they were bleeding from both nostrils, and were also bleeding from the mouth after only half an hour. They didn't appear to be pushing the balls that hard. It took a week for them to heal. Basketballs never caused any bleeding. Buyers, beware!"
2,not like his old jolly ball,"The old jolly balls were made of a durable softer indestructible plastic, just like the jolly balls with handles are still made. The new round jolly ball is made of hard plastic. Charlie will miss his old jolly ball."
5,Cola,"I got the singe CD which included the song, bikeracks. I listned to It once, and I loved it. The CD actually belonged to my sister, and she was going to throw it away, but I took it and kept it, well the whole idea is that I've been looking for the CD for the past 6 months, and now I found it, so Ill be buing it real soon. P.S. Cola kicks &*%, and I hope one day they make it to the top."
2,Run of the Millrock,"Perhaps I miss the point. I fail to see this band's distinction from the hundreds of guitar, bass, drum, singer groups that do none particularly well. They need something trashily catchy or they are doomed."
2,HELP,I love this salt but throw most of it away.How on earth do you keep it from caking? I have teied rice nothing seams to work.Thank youJohn in Vt
5,Celtic Sea Salt,"My daughter recommends this salt as one of the best on the market, per her education at a private cooking school in California. I have not used it yet, but can't wait to do so!"
3,"Good salt, VERY overpriced for the product","After receiving the salt, I honestly believe it is overpriced for what you are getting. I didn't think it was the ""best"" out there, although it gets rave reviews and is supposed to be very good for you. I believe it is overpriced due to the marketing and overly-enticing packaging! I probably won't order it again. Not worth the money, the flavor is nothing unique."
5,Seasalt,"The salt has a nice flavor. I use only right before eating to help keep sodium levels down, you can actually taste it. A bit pricey though."
1,Bag Slit Open and no help from the company!!,This bag of salt came in a box from amazon. When it arrived I opened the box and it was full of salt. The bag had a slit in the side. I will never use a product like that. I contacted the company and they were no help. They told me to contact amazon. I had been on vacation and it was passed the time limit to return the product to amazon. I think it was very poor customer service from the company not to replace the bag for me. I am a brand new customer with this product and was excited to find celtic sea salt because i had read it was good for your health. I am a business owner and i know to keep a new customer I would have gone out of my way to make them happy so they would remain a customer. I will not order from this company again. Customer Service is very important to me and this company dropped the ball.
2,Celtic sea salt,Great product. But was disappointed in the delivery. Was supposed to arrive on 11th didn't get until 14th. Everything else I order is here by the day they say if not earlier. It arrived at slc 80 miles from my home on the 10th. Yet it took 4 days to go 80 miles. Go figure snail mail ups and usps.
5,Mild Flavor and Peace of Mind from Processed Salts,"My spouse and I both believe the taste is more mellow than traditional table salt -- not as acrid would be perhaps the best way to describe it. I make my own ""sports drink"" and it tastes infinitely better with this salt than it does regular salt. Its texture is lighter and it seems to mix into that drink and other foods easier. Knowing I'm avoiding another processed food when I use this helps me to enjoy it as well."
5,Excellent!!,My pharmacist recommended this salt and it is simply the best. It tastes smooth and not bitter like regular table salt. I highly recommend this product.
5,love this product but . . .,"I love Celtic Sea Salt. However, this description clearly says ""fine ground"" and I received course ground. Since this product is less than $10 it was not worth my time to try and send it back."
4,Good natural sea salt,"I bought this after using Real Salt brand just to compare the difference. The Celtic Sea Salt is good - very clean, mild taste. We still prefer the Real Salt over this one though. I wind up using more of the Celtic than the Real Salt because of the differences in flavors. I'd use this again if I couldn't get the other."
1,A better place to purchase,My rating has nothing to do with the actual product but the purchase price.This particular salt can be purchased on the celticseasalt website from 2 to 5 dollars per bag depending on the size bag. Do not purchase this anywhere else you are wasting your money.
1,Celtic Sea Salt has impuriities!,"Has a nice mellower taste than store bought heat-processed table salt.No Iodine, so I supplement with 4 drops of good tasting Liquid DulseBernard Jensen Products - Liquid Dulse, 4 oz liquid(also Very good to FILL thyroid with GOOD iodine!- Keeps from taking in any Radioactive iodine from Japan reactor spill!- Radioactive iodine does Permanent damage to thyroid, and can't be reversed! Radioactivity is sure to work into our food supply...!)Per my dentist (for everyone)- I started gargling with 1/4tsp salt in 8oz of water after brushing.It is VERY unnerving to see the undissolved black/brown specs floating around!The other unprocessed sea salt brands come from ""Less"" pristine waters, but I'll give them a try next time."
4,great,Definitely enjoy this for my cleanse and hope to be able to do something great with the outcome. I Recommend this product.
5,Healthy Salt for your body,I am not a salt person but I had a stroke at a young age last year and my husband did lots of research on foods. One of the easiest changes to do for our body is replace reg table salt with this salt. This has essentials minerals that we used to get in our food but since we dont make our broth etc anymore. It does not taste salty like reg table salt. This salt is not processed and you only need a small amount and this product goes far. The doctors thought it would take me three years to recover and I did recover in 13 months and a big part of it was using this salt. We dont use reg table salt anymore. Also my husband lost 30 pounds using this salt and doing a no carb diet. He will have carbs maybe once a week and still has kept the weight off. I like the fine ground for my food but also use the bigger ground for cooking soups and sauces. Enjoy
4,does something for your health NO other salt can do,"A couple of years ago I tried a very strict alkalizing cleanse program to try to reboot my health. There was a VERY restricted list of things I could eat and drink including restricting salt, but two forms of were allowed; dulse which is not salt, and small quantities of Celtic salt. Why?Apparently Celtic Salt is alkalizing where other salts are not. The human body has become more acidic in Ph over the decades because of diet. In general the healthier, more alkaline choices of whole grains, fruits and vegetables would support proper/healthy Ph but many people do not follow the best eating guidelines including myself. Little steps like using Celtic salt are easy for me to follow to gain small advantages.This salt also tastes great. Not sharp like regular iodized table salt. Great for table use, cooking, baking and anywhere you'd normally use any kind if salt.Pleased with this product and highly recommended."
4,Modesty Blaise,"Considering that this movie was made a long time ago when the technology currently available was not there I felt the show ticked all the boxes. The plot was low key but the characters did what they should ""they entertained"". I thought it was good fun."
3,But there's more...,The only good news here is that Quentin Tarantino is expected to produce a remake of this film. The original was made before the industry standardizad the spoof of spy movies. One can only hope that Tarantino's vision will include the elements missing from the original that we now come to expect in Hollywood films.
1,What a travesty,"I am a huge Modesty Blaise fan. I own and have read all the books and most of the comics. This movie is a disaster. First of all Modesty is BLONDE!!No no no this is all wrong, Modesty is of a Middle Eastern background, how can she be BLONDE!! Next why on earth do Modesty and Willie Garvin KISS!! Arghhhh. Modesty and Willie don't have that kind of a relationship.The important thing about the Modesty Blaise series is the characters and their interaction, this movie is just high camp and sets and costumes. Terrible terrible.If I could give this no stars I would."
2,What A Terrible Movie,"I saw the end of this movie on cable and had to rent it to see if the rest of the movie was as bad... and it was. Aside from Danger: Diabolik, I've never see a movie like this one. Neither star can speak English clearly (Monica Vitti with her thick Italian accent and Terence Stamp with his thick Cockney accent) and there are no redeeming characters.The plot revolves around boxes of diamonds which everybody wants to steal. Sort of spy-thieves. The main selling point is seeing the beautiful Monica Vitti wearing various nightgowns in exotic locations and swank bachelor pads.Definitely a product of it time (1965-1967) and is very colorful.[DW]"
1,A bad film in a disappointing genera: really no stars,"It's too bad that spoofs of the James Bond films tend to be so very bad. Both print and television have done quite well making hip fun of Bond and his imitators, but movies made with the same idea consistantly come up short. Some of them are a lot of fun, even if they don't hold together. Some are completely unwatchable. Modesty Blaise comes somewhere in the middle. It isn't actually revolting, but it's nowhere near as clever as it thinks it is.Fans of the Modesty Blaise comic strip and novels should avoid this film like the plague. This isn't Modesty, or Willie, any more than the Matt Helm films are adaptations of the Matt Helm books. People unfamilliar with the other Modesty material may find this film mildly enjoyable, but would be better off with the Flint movies, which come as close as anything ever done to making a success of this idea."
2,Did it inspire Austin P?,"I first saw this movie during its original release. All these years later, my memories were positive enough for me to buy it. Oh dear! Memories have a habit of being selective. Even though its a satire and by no means to be taken seriously, its so high camp that it just loses you. It doesn't really entertain at any level. The only positive was the thought that maybe it had sown the seed for the far more enjoyable and also-camp-but-not-so-pre-occupied-with-itself Austin Powers."
1,A new standard of awfulness,"I bought this DVD knowing it was bad, but I was interested in the psychedelic aspects of it. I thought maybe it would have a campy ""Batman"" feel to it, being made in the same great year of '66. I was not prepared for how terrible it really is. It's so abysmal that I couldn't finish it. The acting is nauseatingly bad, the script is pathetic, and the actor's voices appear to have been dubbed (badly). I found no kitsch or camp value in it whatsoever - it's just plain awful. In fact, the back cover of the DVD pretty much admits that: the only positive thing they can say is that the movie has ""psychedelic wallpaper"". Yes, it sure does, some very groovy designs indeed, but I need more than wallpaper in a movie to keep me interested. This is one of the worst movies I ever tried to watch. It was put on DVD purely because of the then-current Austin Powers/60's fad. Although I love the sixties, I think all copies of this movie should be burned, and the DVDs made into coasters."
4,For grand-daughter,I purchased this for my grand-daughter for Christmas because she loves to watch the Wiggles. She loved this one as well!
3,Over the Top,"I think Debelah has an amazing voice, there is an exception to this. The over the top ""Mariah Carey""-like high notes, they seem so misplaced in the songs, and they do not seem to enhance the songs, but distract. Just about every song on this album has Debelah ""Screeching High notes"",5 octaves or not, I think it is too much on this CD. If you can get past those failed attempts at sustaining such High notes, it is a really nice CD, great beats, very danceable, and romantic lyrics.Over-all I think there is too much focus on her Highest octaves. Debelah should leave the High notes to Mariah and Minnie Ripperton. Debelah is so much better just singing in her amazing middle voice. I recommend giving this CD a chance, it will grow on you, and she will Grow as a artist up and coming. Thank goodness there is someone to rescue us from the ""Britney-Christina"" invasion."
4,Items appear larger in real life,"I bought this to wear on my belt. While it does work, it is larger in diameter than most flashlights intended to be worn on a belt. The length is similar.I really appreciate the red light and the white light LEDs. There are two buttons on the side of the light, one for each color. Both can be on at the same time."
1,Broke the first day,"The white light switch on this light broke within hours after taking it out of the package. The switch would click but the white light LEDs would either not turn at all or would light at a fraction of their full brightness after knocking the light against the base of my palm a few times (and some times that wouldn't even work). I switched out the batteries three times with different rechargeables and alkalines and it was the same problem. I had not abused or dropped the light beforehand--this was produced just by playing around in my dark apartment. I'll be sticking with other brands (such as Streamlight and Fenix) in the future. Not only have my flashlights from these brands proved dependable but they also produce better light, have better battery life and light output for the same number of batteries (or even fewer batteries). To make matters worse the Smith and Wesson was also more bulky than these lights. For me this light was a real loser."
5,A great piece of gear,"This is a really nice piece of equipment. The LED light is either blueish white or red (or both) and provides a large amount of illumination. Since the unit is using LEDs, we should get essentially an infinite service life out of it, excepting batteries, of course. This tool is extremely well-made, and if reasonably well cared for should literally last a lifetime.The flashlight uses 3 AAA batteries. I would have preferred AA batteries, but since it does use 3 rather than 2 batteries, it has a reasonably good service life between batteries. I have loaded mine up with quality rechargeable AAA batteries, and this seems to work quite well.I use my light for boating (the red light is great for preserving one's night vision while tooling around looking for things on the boat) and whenever I need a small, bright, and handy light. The nylon sheath is first-rate, and comes with the unit.Highly recommended."
4,what I was looking for,"If you're reading this then you know how hard it is to find a good quality LED flashlight that doesn't have a ton of bells and whistles and is a decent price. It took way too long to find this one, but it is what I was looking for. It's JUST a flashlight, but it seems to be good quality. I'm sure I won't use the red LEDs much, but that's fine."
4,A nice flashlight for pilots.,"This is a very useful flashlight for a pilot. It has separate on/off buttons for white and red LEDs. It is compact, yet has heft.It would not be great for general outdoor use because the white LEDs do not throw off enough light, compared to a normal outdoor flashlight. But it is great for close work in a small area."
3,too much red,"This was purchased for use at an astronomy event. This was about the same price as some rather flimsy red LED lights and this looked like it would also serve as a normal flashlight. The normal flashlight works well. There are two on-off buttons one for white light and one for red. These are easy to identify by grip, so no problem with accidentally turning on the bright white light. The switches seem waterproof and reliable. The light output is a broad beam ideal for lighting a path or reading. There is no hot spot for seeing or signaling over a distance.Maybe the red light is intended for some other use, but it is way too bright for maintaining night vision. I found no way to disassemble the flashlight to paint or otherwise dim the red LEDs. The bright red light is a waste of battery power and a waste of night vision."
2,Light Fall short of expectation,"This is a nicely built light. It feels solid when held. I like the holster that comes with it. I taught it cool to have the pouch for the extra batteries. The switches are in the right place for one hand operations. The red light feels adequate. The biggest let down with this light is the LED white light. It is white alright but not bright. I read somewhere it is only 20 Lumen, that is not bright for a high priced LED flash light. There is another comparable LED flashlight Coleman Cree XLamp XR-E LED Multi-Color Flashlight, 3 ""AAA"" that comes stocked with 115 Lumens for cheaper and also has an extra green light for map reading. so you get more for less price. I would say those interested in the S&W should also consider the coleman. I am a pilot and taught the S&W flashlight could be used for night aircarft walk around but I was wrong."
1,Good for about 6 months...then eats batteries,"This flashlight seems well made, but it was only reliable for about 6 months, despite delicate, infrequent use.Lately it works only for about a week after which time the batteries need to be replaced. I have had better success with the cheap $4 LED flash flights that Amazon sells. IF this flashlight would actually emit light for more than a week (maybe 2 hrs of battery life), then I could recommend it. Otherwise, I would go with another model."
4,Well-made and bright,"I was looking for 3 things ... brightness,smaller size and well-made.This fits the bill for all 3It has a sturdy feeling metal case with some weight to it. The end cap screws on with solid threading. Batteries inside have their own plastic piece to keep them lined up correctly.Also bright with 2 easy to use buttons for white or red bulbs.doesn't feel like it will fall apart if you drop it.satisfied as long as it lasts"
2,"My recommendation, buy a different flashlight","Disappointed with this flashlight, the beam is too wide, and can't be focused, rather dim compared to a Surefire G2, red LEDs works well, I don't recommend this flashlight."
3,wanted more...,"lightweight, fairly well made.. but something from S&W, thought it would have been brighter...a good item to just keep in the glovebox of the car, but NOT for any type of real tactical situation."
2,Not that great.,"Smith & Wesson Galaxy 13 LED Flashlight (10 White LED & 3 Red LED)First, I have to admit that light light output is great, and that 3 red LEDs, and separate switch for white and red light are nice features. After saying that I have to point out that the size and weight are ridiculously big for a flashlight powered by 3 AAA batteries. The diameter of flashlight's body looks like you could fit a D cell in there or at least couple of AA's.... AAA batteries for something this big is just a wrong choice. Position of switches on a side of lamp is really convenient if you want to play with them, once you have the lamp in your hand. Otherwise, their position is a poor choice, and they can easily be accidentally turned on while lamp is in it's carrying pouch or in a bag.Overall: It has some nice features but it just seems like it was designedby a person who never ever used and had to carry a flashlight outside of his home."
3,Light output is not sufficient for Night Photography,"After reading all the reviews, I decided to purchase this flashlight for my night photography. The lights arent strong and the whole make is pretty heavy. The dimness has made me not use the flashlight. I use a real cheap set which I picked up at COSTCO for the same price."
4,"Good quality, but not made in the USA","I was proud of myself for spending a little extra money to get a ""Smith and Wesson"" flashlight because I knew they made all of their stuff in the USA. Their website even says ""Smith & Wesson - Made in the USA since 1854"". But apparently this flashlight doesn't count. Some chinese company has been allowed to license the S&W; name and logo for this product.So in short - this is NOT a Smith and Wesson flashlight."
3,Not Really Bright,This flashlight is well made but I am disappointed in the firepower. It is very bright when you look into the lens but it does not illuminate any better than an old fashioned 2 cell flashlight. The red is a nice feature if you need it.
5,Quality flashlight,"Durable, well constructed and very bright. Would recommend to anyone looking for a good value in flashlights.Easy switching from red to white lighting and back."
5,A Submarine MUST,I am learning a lot about life on a sub and this flashlight is a must for an officer on the boat. The red LED is a must and makes a perfect useful gift. Buy lots of batteries to send your loved one off with since they can't buy them underwater:)
5,I LOVE this flashlight,"small, light, sturdy; gives very good light in both white and red. Am thinking of buying another."
3,On off buttons are the undoing of an otherwise good light,"After very little use the flimsy rubber cover for the white light button split open. Recovered the button connector part the first time it fell out. The second time it fell out it disappeared into small parts limbo. (It was a dark and stormy night.)My inelegant but workable fix was to cut and insert a 1/4"" long piece of 10-24 threaded rod into the button cavity. I then wrapped button area with high quality electrical yellow tape.Update: Finally sent the light in for service and promptly received a new unit. We also bought a second unit."
2,unimpressed with power of light,I attempted to used this to track a deer a hunting buddy shot. I quickly realized this was not enough light to see the blood trail. It has 2 buttons for the different lights. which I seem to constantly hit the wrong button. maybe it is user error and maybe it is a bad design. I should have bought a light with more Lumens. I have a couple other lights and they are brighter and more compact. this light is way too big. your mileage may vary. just my impressions.
2,Not for police work,"Was too big to fit in my 1"" duty belt flashlight holder. A good solid flashlight for any civilian however."
5,"Night vision preserved, but normal power when needed","As a lifetime boater involved in search and rescue, often after dark, I wanted a powerful white light that could also be used under nighttime conditions and would not destroy night vision. The S&W LED exceeded my hopes. Separate switches insure that white light will not accidentally be triggered when only red light is desired to preserve night vision. Chart reading is still possible (yes, some boaters still use charts in addition to GPS!), consulting notes, managing cockpit activities are all possible because of the brilliance of the LED's. The unit is attractive, strong, well machined, and of high quality (it IS Smith & Wesson, after all!). Great accessory for boating, hunting, camping, etc. Highly recommend."
5,Still great after 3.5 years,"After 3.5 years, the flashlight has had no issues, barely used any batteries because of the LED. The LED is very bright - it's the best flashlight in my house. It's the one I'd want in an emergency and it's the one I reach for if I need a strong, direct light when working on something."
5,Handy size and very bright,The first flashlight received had a defective switch for the white light. Amazon does the return and exchange gig better than any other web merchant. The new flashlight works great. I use it almost daily in my maintenance job. The holder works well and overall this flashlight is a pretty good value. The size and weight are just right for carrying on your belt!
5,"Perfect size, right price, superb performance.",The title says it all!I can hardly believe that much light comes from 3 AAA batteries!Woody
4,S&W Galaxy 13 LED Flashlight,"Solid design, no complaints. I was a little leary of the red only having 3 led's. But it did its job and then some.."
2,No wrist strap,"Nice light, well made. But why would anyone design a tactical-style flashlight without a place to attach a wrist strap. Not recommended for use on or near the water."
4,Great flashlights,"These things are great. They are well built, and very bright. The only downside is that they are made by a gun manufacturer."
4,Great work torch,I need a dual colour torch at work and this performs well. I have had no negative experiences with this torch.
4,Issues,"Upon replacing batteries, a spring contact ""dropped"" out of the battery holder. I am having NO success at replacing this myself, and have yet to get a reply from Amazon. Nice light, but useless if all parts don't function. I am getting so sick of cheap junk, I thought the Smith & Wesson name meant quality, I am a fool. Hoping I can just get a replacement holder, but if they want a complete return, it will be for a refund. Thirty five dollar flashlight depending on a two cent part is not a recipe for success.....Update Edit: The flashlight is very nice, but has a weak point discussed above. However, I have revised my rating based on the customer service at Smith & Wesson. I eventually found the correct contact and they responded with not one, but two replacement battery holders, and shipped very fast. This makes the light whole again. My thanks to S&W....;."
3,Red is great! White not so much....,"The red option works great, great output. The white, and this is probably because the white leds are on the outer ring, are not very powerful.It is bright and it is better than an old single bulb torch, but stll the beam for the white seam narrow focused, and a bit hot and harsh, use it for indoors, not outdoors."
3,The light at the end of the funnel,"Keep your receipt.I bought this flashlight on Amazon and have owned it for less than year. One of the buttons may have an intermittent short (after very little use), because the intensity of the white light flickers between normal brightness and about half-bright. Too bad because the fit and finish of this item is excellent. I so wanted it to be the perfect flashlight, meaning, simply stated, the LAST flashlight I would ever have to buy -- one that works and keeps working.Operationally, you should be aware that while LEDs are very efficient, the light is not well-focused, so it diffuses quickly. This flashlight is great out to 10 feet or so; any farther, you might want a focused halogen light instead (for example, if you were trying to find navigational markers on a dark night at sea)."
2,Half functional,"Received this as a stocking stuffer, nice I know, and only the red light works on this flashlight. Funny thing is I really found myself stuck in the dark needing a flashlight, opened it from its packaging only to discover that clicking on the rubber covered white light button didn't do anything. I swapped out batteries, nothing. Only the red light works. Hopefully I can return it."
1,Too freaking bright!,"I purchased this flash light to use as a night vision light while flying. Usually a red light would be convienant but this thing, even with the red LEDs, it is too bright to allow your eyes to get used to night vision. Too bright to use the red light. I do not like this."
3,"good product, but...","It is a good flashlight, but there are better brands, lifetime guarantee, and cheaper price."
4,versatile for outdoor use,"I expected this to be good from other reviews. What surprised me in a less positive way is that it is relatively large and heavy for using only 3xAAA batteries, but it is very solid. What surprised me in a good way is that the red LED set is brighter than I expected, and I use that almost exclusively for walking the dogs at night. Enough light to walk with if there is any ambient light at all. The white beam is relatively broad, so this is not good for illuminating a spot well, but it suits my dog-walking use very well. overall, it exceeded my expectations."
2,Not consistent when experiencing average use.,"Avoiding the cheaper (Chinese-made) flashlights listed on Amazon, the Smith & Wesson Galaxy looked like a good investment -- solid construction, case, and great brightness.While the amount of light you get is very good with the amount of bulbs installed, they are not consistent -- meaning, they will start to flicker after average use. After a while, I have to keep hitting the flashlight with my hand to sustain some longevity with the beam of LED light.Most users here are reviewing based on 1 or 2 uses, but after almost 6 months of use, it would be one I would avoid."
3,Ok flashlight,"I wanted a flashlight I could use out on deck and in the wheelhouse. It worked great for a couple of weeks but then it got finicky. It wouldn't turn on until I hit it a couple of times. I did drop it on a steel deck a few times, probably knocked something loose. Not impressed. Going back to my usual Pelican flashlight and I bought a red penlight for use in the wheelhouse at night."
5,A Magnificent Requiem,"Durufle is a composer who is new to me. I have really been missing something! Because my church choir was preparing a performance of this lovely and complex piece of music, I decided to familiarize myself with it, and I was well rewarded. Written in the 1940s, immediately after the end of World War II, this work harbors no bitterness towards the recent occupation, but speaks to the joy of salvation."
4,Winter music,"I always like to have alternative music to drift to sleep. I'd heard some of David Nevue's work and liked it, but this album is sporadic in giving this listener the inspiration to enter dreamtime."
3,Mixed reviews,"Although the beginning of this book has some good insights about the current chaotic state of many families and why change is important, once you get into the heart of it, it's not ideal for many families. He suggests a fairly regimented schedule to keep families balanced. Although this may seem ideal, I'm not sure its realistic. There are too many unique factors in families such as kids with learning disabilities, etc., which would prevent this plan from working well. There are things from the book which can be implemented though so its worth checking out. Gain what you can from it but don't feel bad if it's not a good plan for your family."
1,Poor text for a 100 level course,"I agree with the previous reviewer. I was panic stricken when I received this textbook as I was fully prepared to fail this class. However, the professor I had did an excellent job of taking a poorly written, overly complex text and turning the material into easy to understand concepts. The only redeeming factor in this text is the abundance of graphs, maps, etc. Those we used very extensively in class and they did help to clarify the material. Of course, if your professor chooses this text for your class, you need to purchase it. Overall I'm glad I did purchase the text because the graphs, maps, etc were helpful and also required for reference in several exercises we did in this class. I'm also glad to be able to sell it back."
2,Dense reading,"This book could have been written and organized a lot better. It is unnecessarily convoluted and makes for a tortuous read. It may well be a contributor to the high suicide rate among college students. I'm kidding, but you get my point."
5,Very fine tools,"I kept running into these security screws. Even the coffee pot had them. These are very well built tools, and the storage case is perfect. The only thing that might give one trouble, is that if the fastener you are trying to undo in inside a deep well. The bits are short, but overall this is a great addition to my toolbox."
4,Ambient Excelence,"This is a very interesting cd. The music is relaxing, without being dull Good job!"
3,"Good book, but very short.","Thes book was short,only 47 pages. But even though there was not much space, the writer conveyed an entire story. The story is vauge in some areas and very descriptive in others, and sometimes you might not be sure of the significance of one character or thing. But I also thought that it was like a poem in some spots. This would be a good book for young children."
1,Hard to stomach,"This is required reading for my tax class, and that's the only way I'd finish it. This book combines tax/IRS info with a terrible story about a tax agent. There is no depth to any of the characters. After one of his informants is killed right in front of him, the main character mostly just shrugs and moves on with his life. The plot isn't even interesting. If you want to get some of the basics about tax at the sacrifice of a plot, buy this book. I guess it IS better than a dry textbook with small type and two inches of material, but not much better."
5,The Best Old-Time Band In The (Known) Universe!,"These guys, many of whom are gone now, were the hard-drivingest old-time string band ever to record. This is a classic recording, and should be in every Old-Time Music fan's collection. From the opening bow-strokes of ""Fortune"" to the last note of ""Pretty Little Girl"" this CD kicks ass! If you don't have it, you haven't heard the best that the Blue Ridge has to offer. Does it sound like I like the Camp Creek Boys? Well, duh..."
5,Thanks for keeping our seniors active!,Our seniors love the great music and low impact workout they receive from this product. Makes everyone want to dance as well as exercise!
5,fun and helpful.,"I have several different versions of this tape. I like it cause it has all sit down exercises. I'm elderly and disabled so this exercise is great for me. I don't think it would help anyone lose weight, but some exercise is better than none."
3,"terrific acoustics/recording but bland, few good pieces","This has the best version Barber's adagio for strings I have heard, the set is worth it just for that. Rachmaninoff's Vocalise is the only other piece I like. The recording does capture the feel of a cathedral -with 5 second decay time. Despite that, the bulk of it is uninvolving. There is also very little of the lower-octave material usually associated with the pipe organ."
1,Funeral-home music,"This reminded me of music played at funeral homes. It is lifeless. The same stops are used throughout. These pieces have a muted, schmaltzy tone, and most meander without much discernible rhythm. I resold it and bought this instead:Glorious Pipes: Organ Music Through the Ages."
2,Not completely stainless steel!,"My husband uses clippers in the shower, and the rust marks left from cheaper, non-stainless steel clippers really annoy me. So, I bought the Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipper for him. Unfortunately, it is not completely stainless. The bolt that holds the two pieces together is non-stainless and rusts! I essentially paid 5x the amount of a cheaper clippers for the same problem, and am very disappointed in the false advertizing."
1,terrible,"leaves my nails sharp and rough, difficult to use, went back to the $2.00 drug store clippers, way better and cheaper"
5,You get what you pay for with this clipper,It cuts with twice the ease of my other clippers and feels like great quality. I'd definitely recommend this upgrade.
2,Not nearly as good as I'd hoped for,"The clippers seem sharp, but surprisingly often leave torn and partially attached fragments at the ends of my nails. In other words, although the blade seems very sharp, it often doesn't give me a clean cut.I also don't like that the top bar is shorter than the bottom one. It makes for an odd grip. No built-in file is really strange, too - that should be a given. And finally, the two slits at the bottom seem to be decorative only - I can't imagine a practical purpose for them.Vastly overpriced, and not that good."
5,the Snap-On equivalent of finger nail clippers,"i'd broken at least 3 cheap drugstore nail clippers before i bought the Seki. it cuts through finger nails like a hot knife through butter, is solid in the hand, and feels like it will never break. the blades are sharp enough to require some care while clipping. a superior product for hygiene - never buy a cheap clipper again!"
4,Sharp!,These are the sharpest clippers I have ever had. I have very strong finger nails and these will cut right through them without tearing the nail. The weight and finish is excellent. I gave them a 4 because they could be a little longer for easier handling.
5,wow never knew there was a difference.,Never knew there was a difference in nail clippers. These things clip VERY cleanly and with pretty much no effort at all. I was really surprised to be honest. Comfortable to use and great results!
5,WOW!,Those clippers are sharp! They cut right through the nails leaving a clean cut. They're so sharp I love cutting my nails LOL
4,Nice clippers,"These clippers are expensive but they work great. I've never used a pair this good in my live. I can feel the quality every time I touch them. If you're willing to pay a high price, I don't think you can do batter than this."
4,"Great clipper, but no without flaws.","I will keep this review short, after all, you are only buying a nail clipper :)This is one well constructed quality product. It feels nice in hand. It is very sharp and you can clip your fingernails effortless. This is probably the sharpest nail clipper I've used in my life.I have very thick thumb nails, and I've always struggled when clipping these tough nails in the past. This clipper really helps, it gives sharp and clean cut.Since there are 160 (and counting) reviews praising this little clipper, I will provide you some insight on what I don't like about it.Cons: when you clip your nails, they fly everywhere! It's an old fashioned clipper. Now days, most of the clippers have a little storage area on it to gather all of your clipped off fingernails, so it won't make a mess. This one doesn't have it. So if you hate picking up fingernails everywhere after clipping, you might want to consider another clipper.Bottom line: Very sharp, high quality clipper."
3,It Does the Job,"I find the Seki Edge Finger Nail clipper ok. It does the job, I do not find it particularly easy to use. It is very sharp, but the shape of my fingernails means that it is hard for me to cut close to the outer edges of the nail. I ordered theirscissors, but those had a serrated edge and simply ""tore"" my nails instead of cutting. Mind you, my nails are very thin and they tear easy. They also flare on the sides, so they are ""problem nails"". I assume for the average person this clipper will found to be more than satisfactory. It certainly seems to be very well constructed and precise... just not for me:-("
3,"Sharp, but not for hang nails","Nice design, and good stainless steel feel to it. Very good at cutting nail, for a clean cut. Not great at getting in and clipping hang nails or the cuticle around the nail. Overall a good look and feel to the clippers themselves, I just want a more precision cut outside the nail itself."
5,Excellent and worth the money,Awesome. This is how fingernail scissors should work. We need to get a 2nd paid since my hubby is always accusing me of hiding these from him :)
5,Will never buy another brand,I love these clippers and will never buy a different brand again. They work better than any other pair of clippers I have ever owned. I was going to buy the small baby cliippers for my daughter's nails but didn't like that it had a catch for the nails.
3,"Really strong, but hard to collect the nails!","This is a really good quality nail clipper, but the nails are thrown far away so you need to vacuum clean after each use!"
4,Better than an average nail clipper,"These nail clippers are made in Japan (not China) and are made of high grade steel with sharper edges and better leverage than an average nail clipper. You nails will be cut noticeably more precisely and with less effort. You will hardly need to press on the lever to cut your nails. The result is your nails will look cleaner without jagged edges.These will cut your toenails as well. I personally prefer these over the regular toenail clippers since these are smaller and can cut with more precision than regular toenail clippers. These also have enough leverage to cut toenails with ease.If you are looking for a bargain then I would stick to the regular nail clippers that cost only 1/3 as much. I never had issues with regular nail clippers. But then again, these clippers are clearly better and built to last and will serve me well for decades."
4,Great clipper,"Really like this fingernail clipper-sharp, and does its job well. The only thing I'd change is to make a ""catcher"" for the nail clippings, as some clippers have, but it's no big deal. A bit expensive for a nail clipper, but worth so much more than the throw-away clippers you get in sets, or simply have laying around.I am happy with this, and would buy it again no contest."
3,Still like my cheap Trim clipper better,"Great quality - maybe too good? I had a cheap Trim brand clipper that I had for years and loved - but recently lost. None of the other brands of cheap clippers I had worked well at all so I thought I'd try these. These are sharp and work very smoothly but (it's hard to explain), you don't get a lot of feedback - and plus (to me), they are not at all comfortable to hold. They simply don't work as well as my old pair. Oh well, they look good :)"
3,"Good, but Not for Short Nails","These clippers are well made and quite sharp. They should work well on longer nails, but as a guy who keeps his short they don't work so well. The head of the clipper is just too thick to easily get in close."
2,disappointed,"I thought this nail clipper was going to be much better quality than the typical clippers you can buy in the drug store. But I was disappointed. The clippers are certainly powerful, but they leave a ragged edge. I have to file my nails every time I use this clipper."
2,Cuts Too Clean an Edge,"I bought a pair of these clippers. I can understand some of the comments people make about having to file your nails after. The clippers make such a clean cut that the edge is sharp. I looked under a microscope and there is no burr or rise in the nail, but the 90 degree edge is sharp. Even my daughter's nails (age 4) were sharp after cutting with the clippers."
1,cost vs. quality of cut is low,"Simply put these do not cut smooth. They are barely better than the cheapest ones you would find at walmart. The cut leaves the shredded fingernail feeling. The actual steel it is made of appears to be good but the cut is poor. The revlon deluxe clippers have a better edge. Maybe it is just quality control, but at $15 I recommend you not even try these."
5,sharp and easy to handle,the little handle that you push does not slide around as you press it. cuts sharply and neatly.
1,They don't work on cuticles at all!,"I had not been happy with old clippers so I thought I would order a good pair. Well, these were not the ones. Ok for nails but I wanted it for skin too."
4,Great nail clipper,"As other reviews have said, this clipper takes a while to get used to. It is heavy and clips hard, and I cut into my skin/cuticle a couple times the first few times I used it. But once I got used to it I really liked it. It is strong enough for even the toughest nails, hand or feet, and it cuts cleanly. Steel is high quality stuff too. A little pricey especially when you are used to buying clippers for 4-5 dollars, but if you think you might want this, I think it's worth it!"
5,Finally,"Yeah, I paid too much for this clipper. That being said, it is the best one I have ever used!My sister was right; pay a few more bucks at the start to avoid replacing every other year.I have no doubt this will be the last one I ever have to buy."
5,Gifted,Bought both the finger and toe nail clippers for my husband. He reallylikes the heft of these items. Good choice
4,Fantastic!,I love these clippers. It took me a while to decide to buy such expensive clippers. These are fantastic. I've spent more than what I paid for these buying horrible clippers that I toss in the recycle bin. These give a nice clean cut. They're solid and will last a long time. I've hidden them from the rest of my family so they won't disappear. I told them if they're nice I'll let them use 'em.
3,Cuts sharp but I can't stand the texture,"The clippers cut really well, but the texture really bothers me. All around the blades it has a brushed metal feel, and every time I push my nails into it they drag/grate against it and it reminds me of a chalk board. I know that probably shouldn't matter, but it just makes it feel weird to me."
3,Great but expensive,"Between the products cost and the shipping I spent around $30 on this.. I mean come on, at the end of the day it's just a nail clipper.Clips like a beast tho."
2,defected on arrival,"the cutting edge did not match, and the cut was not better than the $2 one from Walmart. It was not comfortable in our hand. and we are not big. (keep in mind these are deigned and made from Asia). We also brought the toe nail cutter, and it was much much better, and it work well for finger nails too."
5,High quality,"These are expensive, perhaps 10 to 20 times the cost of drug store clippers. They are worth it, at least to me. Here's why:The bottom handle part is longer and wider so the clipper doesn't twist and jump out your hands.The blade is much sharper so it snaps when it cuts.The jaws of the clipper are open wider at rest so it's easier to insert your nails.The spring action is much stronger so each cut is more purposeful, it should last longer.I bought a Brookstone clipper set that cost about four times as much. This clipper is better than the one in that set."
4,Wow!,"I didn't know there was anything like this on the market. I thought I was going upmarket because I went to the beauty section and bought the Revlon clippers instead of the checkout stand clippers. These are so solid and sharp.Why 4 stars? (1) No nail file, and (2) it's hard to explain but the cutter is more blunt-nosed than the cheapies. You have to work a little harder to get short nails into the opening. They'll take some practice but I'm confident that these will last a very long time."
4,"Feels cheap, but works well.","As with many of my Amazon purchases, this was based on the highest ratings. I usually like all things Japanese-manufactured, so I thought, ""It's the highest-rated and Japanese? Sure, I'll try it!""When I received it the material felt cheap. I'm sure I'm just being picky, but for $15+ clippers (which don't include a file) I expected something more solid. Nevertheless, I tried them out and they certainly cut better than my previous Revlons.So far so good. But for the price I expected, as mentioned, something more solid, and with at least a bonus file, even if that wasn't the best built-in file in the world."
2,You may end up having to buy another course,"Looking at the good side of this course, the dialogues use everyday vocabulary in a variety of settings. The book may make the language look easy, it is not demanding, but this is a mixed blessing, for you do not learn much either. I was rather disappointed. There does not seem to be a plan to the way in which the language is presented, vocabulary and grammar are hardly explained and the tapes are too fast.This course can however be complemented with Manuela Cook's Portuguese course (February 2002), which gives you more all around and has taught me Portuguese for Brazil and also other parts of the world where this language is spoken. I found in it the vocabulary and grammar explanations I needed; the tapes are at the right speed; and there are plenty of exercises, which are fun to do and gave me the practice I was looking for."
1,You may feel cheated,"This book claims to be a complete course and a teach yourself one. Well, it's neither. This is no more than a feeble introduction to the language. Claiming that it is a complete course is misleading. For a teach yourself book it does not give you enough support. I had to buy a dictionary because the vocabulary is only part explained. I had to buy a grammar because the language explanations are unclear, to say the least. I had to pay a native speaker to help and pronounce the words because the recordings are too fast. The native speaker disagrees with most of the book, she says that this is not Brazilian Portuguese, is foreign Portuguese. Buying this course has been a frustrating experience and money badly spent. I feel positively cheated."
2,Too expensive for what you can get out of it!,"The audio is too fast for any beginner to follow. The dialogues may have some useful vocabulary but the vocabulary is not explained properly. Nothing is explained properly really! The whole thing is rushed through. You just get the language as it comes. There is no grading, no teaching step by step, as you find in a good course. Actually I have found one. If you want a good teach yourself portuguese course, get Manuela Cook's instead!"
2,Not the best for the self-taught learner,"In addition to the tapes being too fast, for a teach-yourself course this book should explain things better. In the first unit you come across 'como se escreve?' The translation in the vocabulary box is 'how do you write it?' The grammar pages give 'voce / tu /o senhor / a senhora' for 'you', no mention to 'se'. 'Se' crops up again in the second unit for 'como se chama?' 'what is your name?' The grammar pages show 'se' meaning 'his / her / yourself'. Still no explanation for 'como se escreve?' 'how do you write it?'. The whole course is written in this style. Everything is rushed through and some of it does not seem to make much sense. Very frustrating!"
2,It could be much better,"The whole course lacks in structure. Vocabulary covers different useful areas, but there is not a graded progression in the way the language is introduced. It all seems to be at random. The tapes are too fast. As a whole, the course is not user friendly for the very beginner and it does not offer enough to be a refresher course. I would recommend another course instead. Prista's Say it in Portuguese would be a good choice."
2,One or two not three,"This course is showing three star rating. How can it show three stars with so many ones and twos. Surely it does not add up to more than a two average rating. Myself I coudn't give it more. Fast tape, poor lessons, frustrating all around, I gave it up and bought another course."
1,Very limited and misleading,This is advertised as a complete course but gives you only the basics and not very clearly explained. As a course it lacks the usual building up from easy beginnings to more complete sentences. You just get the language from the dialogues and this is never well explained.The tapes are difficult to follow. You buy this course thinking you have a complete course and all you get is a poor beginners course.
2,false advertisement,"When I bought this book it was advertised as an audio book. There was no tape. Don't buy it if you need to hear it, because there is no tape."
3,Good points and bad points,"This book and 2-tape series on Brazilian portuguese has both bad points and good points. (The book is not worth getting without the tapes). The bad - the tapes move very quickly with minimal practice opportunities for the listener - if just beginning to learn the language, you will have to constantly rewind the tapes, and the difficulty level progresses very quickly. The good - you will learn a lot of useful vocabulary and hear and practice conversations in a wide range of settings. I suggest you start with another course to learn the beginning Brazilian portuguese, and then try this course to learn additional vocabulary and material."
5,Brazilian Portuguese -Beginners by Sue Tyson-Ward,"I have been using a number of different methods to try and learn Brazilian Portuguese, including Rosetta Stone software. [...] I have learned more from this book than any other method. Nobody likes to study; although, I actually look forward to come home from work and dive into the book rather than use my [...] software.To get the most benefit from this book, try and learn the pronunciation. Fortunately, my husband is Brazilian so he helps me with that aspect. He said I am doing absolutely fantastic since I have been using this book. I hope an advanced book will be released soon!!!!"
3,A Good Beginning,"I found this book helpful in re-learning some rudimentary Brazilian Portuguese. The organization leaves something to be desired, as it is difficult to reference already learned material, but overall, I recommend the book as an overview. Unfortunately, the authors become a little overzealous at the end, trying to introduce very complex verb forms without proper explanation. Also, I found several glaring inconsistencies in the grammar and verb sections, which only can be attributed to poor editing. I did enjoy the audio tapes of colourful Brazilian pronounciation. What the book accomplished for me was a true desire to delve further into this beautiful and interesting language."
4,FINALLY something great again!,"There's not much to be said about this album besidesthat EVERYTHING about it is truly great.This c.d covers all ground: The fast rocker, the dancy number,the pop commercial hit, the darker emotional track..All in all, the ONLY band you need to discover this year."
2,get your guns not load up on guns,"for one thing these guys aren't as nearly as good as nirvana so the people that call them the nirvana of the uk are selling nirvana short. yeah they do write similar to nirvana but the music isn't up to par, they may have 2 good songs on the album and thats it, all of nirvana's songs are amazing. i would say this band is more similar to franz ferdinand than nirvana."
2,Disappointing,"I heard the single 'Cosmopolitan' on the radio and I thought this band was going to be awesome and really rocking. I was wrong. Not dead wrong, but very wrong. The music itself is good and the lyrics are great (hence 2 stars), but unfortunately the singer's voice never really quite matches up with what everybody else is doing. He's too laid back on the fast songs and he never really gives this album the push it deserves. These guys definitely fall under the umbrella of the ""Franz Ferdinand"" style bands, only with a little more aggression. If you're looking for a CD with the vibe of 'Cosmopolitan', you are going to be disappointed."
5,What should I say..........................................,"This band is just too great although they sound a bit (a lot maybe) like Nirvana, but that's OK. I love their style, I love the music; Nine Black Alps surely rocks!!!Recommended song: Not Everyone (track number 3)"
4,A good buy,"I picked this up for $3 at a used cd store. I saw it and remembered having heard them compared to Nirvana, so I took a chance seeing as I wasn't going to waste $15 or anything. I was impressed by the sound, very grunge and still relevant, much like the rock revolution that occured around 2003 or 2004 (namely the Hives, Vines, Strokes etc). ""Cosmopolitan"" is the best track, and although it gets repeditive at times, it's a solid record. ""Behind Your Eyes"" and ""Intermission"" are two folkier acoustic tracks and this band makes them work. The lyrics are well written and socially insightful at times. Worth checking out if you're into Nirvana or the Vines. The only disappointment for me was that ""Southern Cross"" wasn't a CSN cover."
4,Ray Nitschke is now a center piece on our bookshelf...,"For an old diehard Packer fan, having a model of Ray Nitschke is a realfun thing. There was no one like him and in the 50's and 60's we would watch him on the field as much as Starr, Taylor or any other Packer star. Though you may be taken aback by the 'thinness' of his left arm in themodel, you can adjust the arm so that this 'flaw' in the design will be minimized. The colors are good; he is realistic and it is virtually indestructible. The wife even likes it on the bookshelve! Well, I guess a better word is 'tolerates'."
1,Utter rip-off,"This ""book"" consists of photocopies of about 30 of the ""Family Upstairs"" comics from the 1910s. The photocopies are so bad that you can't read the texts. They are not dated. There is no commentary. Utterly worthless."
3,Great images - Few words,A nice book to browse if you want to get a feel for old world swedish style & creativity. This is a book with few words and loads of images. Not a wasted investment. I am sure I will refer to this many times in the next few years.
5,Awesome book,I bought this book for a gift and my partner loves it. It was in perfect condition - good as new. No point in spending money on brand new books when you get the same thing for less than half the price.I love this brand - all the photos are amazing.
5,All that's missing is Ben Kenobi whispering in your ear...,"This collection of all the X-wing titles (before Tie Fighter) is a great value, and an excellent introduction into the wonderful world of Rebel dogfighting. The sound effects, the graphics, the atmosphere--all of it evokes images of your favorite space battles in the Star Wars movies. You get to start slow, and work your way up to the really tough missions--and you'll need the time to learn, trust me! Quite simply one of the most all-around enjoyable games I've ever played."
1,Book of Embraces,"This book was required for my daughter's high school English class. It made little sense to us. The thoughts may be beautiful, as described by others, but they were disconnected and incoherent. I wondered if the writer had some form of mental illness or something was lost in translation."
5,You can't afford not to read this book,"This masterpiece by Uruguayan writer Eduardo Galeano is written in the shape of very short, anecdote-like stories, some comprising less than a page. Through his powerful language and masterful technique, he conveys the desolation of living under a dictatorship, the difficulties of an artist's task, and, above all, the dignity and courage of unknown and yet exceptional people throughout Latin America. This book, strong, raw and moving, is a must. Go ahead and buy it."
4,Take your time,"Like all sweet embraces, these brief lines should be mulled over with some contemplation. They are lovely on the surface and so valuable when you allow some introspection."
4,Great sleeper hit! WATCH This movie ASAP,"Today, teen comedies involve a lot crude humor and the kids just never learn anything. ""Happy Campers"" has BOTH, and mixes them well which will satisfy a wide audience. Why I never saw this movie get a national release is beyond me. This movie was ten times better then American Pie's or any of the other lousy and souless teen movies.What was written in this movie growing up I lived through. One character in the movie goes off on the same feelings I once had.This story really taps into what kids go through today. This is a must watch folks, sit back and enjoy some laughs as well as somethings to think about from you youth or if you are in this age group of the kids in the film they might cover issues and feelings you are currently going through.Fantastic movie!"
1,Disappointing,"This isn't your typical teenage flick, no; it's far worse, the acting is substandard and someone forgot to have a plot. I purchased this DVD at the request of my daughters, they are Brad Renfro fans but even they were disapointed. I recommend renting this first before you purchase a DVD, you may save yourself a little green."
4,Not your ordinary bloodsucker story,"I hate vampire novels, this wasn't one of those. It's about a creature that drinks blood. There should be a whole other word for Little's character. He tells a good story, great characters, and an Asian main character to boot. Refreshing. I like his work, it's always fun. Not excessively deep, but good old ""once upon a time"" storytelling."
4,the summoning,"Very good vampire novel. I enjoy horror novels but it seems like everybody has to write a vampire story. (Some try to make a career out of writing vampire novels) This is different enough to make the reader want to say ""ok just one more vampire novel"". This novel touches on the fact that vampire lore is different in different countires. Not every vampire can be destroyed by a wooden stake, garlic, cross or holy water."
2,A Chinese Vampire...So What?,"To keep it brief, it's typical of Bentley Little's work - an interesting concept, but the whole thing falls apart about halfway through it and you'll find yourself rushing through the last 100 pages just to end it and be able to start on something better.The usual suspects (in so far as Bentley's body of work are concerned) are all present - lame characters, bad pacing, too much going on for him to wrap up effectively and no sense of where or how to actually END a book.Not worth your time."
4,Another Fascinating Bentley Book!,"""The Summoning"" orginally came out in 1993 and went out of print. Now, luckily for all us horror fans, Bentley re-published it! This novel takes place in Arizona, just like all of Bentley's other novels. Brad Woods, a local coroner, is noticing a change going on in his small town of Rio Verde, Arizona. People are acting strange and having their blood sucked out of them and left to die. Brad, Robert, (the town sheriff), Rich (the newspaper chief), must hunt down this ""vampire"" and kill it before another one of their friends are drank to death. They along with Sue Wing, a local twenty year old woman, whose grandma knows a lot about vampires join the task force. This book is quite long, 541 pages to be exact, but it is by far, the best vampire horror novel I have read in my life.Brad Stonecipher"
4,Typical Little: Excellent 'til the End,"I say 'typical' simply because the two Little novels I've read ended, thematically at least, similarly: very unsatisfying after the great buildup. This book is an over-the-top example of this. 520 pages of really interesting, really intriguing buildup, then 10 pages of climax, in which a character dies for a pretty unclear reason. Bentley Little is a great writer, but it just seems like, at the end of every novel, he runs out of steam and just wants the damned thing to be overwith. But the first 520/540ths of the book is definitely worth it. Fun."
3,Good but way too long,"Maybe because I've been reared on Hip Vamp stories from the TV show Buffy and Angel this just didn't seem scary or compelling to me and it just limps along for 3-400 pages.The action, where they meet the Vampire, doesn't happen until the last 20 pages and then it just kinda ends. I had hoped for more after dedicating all that time to such a long book."
4,Who Is The Vampire? Great Novel...Dumb People,"This is Little's 4th novel and was published in 1993. This is his only vampire tail, but is a worthy one. In the small town of Rio Verde, Arizona, strange corpses have been found. The autopsies performed on them showed the bodies had completely drained of blood and bodily fluids. The only person who knows the remedy is Sue Wing, a Chinese teenager, who's grandmother had an unearthly encounter with the CURP-HU-GIRNGSI (Corpse-who-drinks-blood). As more and more bloodsuckings occur, its up to the police autopsy expert, Sue Wing, and small town reporter Rich Carter to stop it. A great read, a little exaggerated though. And a character I liked had to die, that's not right!"
3,Good but not the best...,"I like this record, but it's not what you might expect from the boys... a little too processed. I prefer the thrashier psychobilly from RHH disks like ""Smoke 'em if you got 'em"", which definitely sounds more ""live""."
1,Not a good example of the Rev,"This album misses it totally for me.I love the first three albums, great melodys, great guitar playing. This is more like some kind of bar chord punk. I don't mind a band changing up but this is a step down. The Rev. is known for great guitar playing, this album doesn't feature that at all."
1,This is horrible.,"I admit that in the past, Rev. Heat has been ""better"", or actually not as worse, than the other ""psychobilly"" bands, but with this album he proves that he's no better than the rest. I don't even know why it's called psychobilly, just call it punk or metal cause that's what it is. You might like this album if you're from California or like heavy metal, but it certainly ain't ""rockabilly"". A lot of this also sounds to be influenced by industrial too."
2,Very disappointing,"Like other first-time buyers, I'm trying to figure out whether I should buy now or wait. But this book gave me virtually no practical advice about how to judge my local market (except to compare average home prices to average incomes--which is a nearly meaningless statistic for projecting price increases or decreases). He defines ""crash"" as a 10-20% price drop, but offers no real time line. Basically, by focusing on the so-called national housing market, this book becomes little more than mishmash of charts, tables, and statistics (GIGO).Conclusion: disappointing and superficial!"
1,Opportunism,"Talbott is sensationalistic and superficial. I expected far more scholarly work from someone with his CV. My dog could have more effectively argued Talbott's hypotheses.As a real estate broker with 25 years of experience investing in commercial real estate, I bought the book in hopes of finding more than basic tabloid analysis. I learned exactly nothing- what a disappointment."
4,"So many reviews, so much idiocy","Amazing how 30+ readers can take the same book and come to such differing conclusions.* I have to say that overall the book provided some interesting insight and food for thought.* Book TITLE was overly provacative. Above anything I think the author is simply saying you should run your numbers VERY closely before buying residential real estate.* I laugh at those idiots who, in claiming the book's premise is false, do little more than stating the author is a LOSER and then go on to point out that since prices have continued to rise over the past six months a crash will not happen. That shred of evidence is then invoked to counter all the author's claims. Do these people really READ these books????"
1,Great idea with no solid theory,This title had a great catching phrase. But once I read the book I came to a conclusion that the author had no solid understanding of the present market. He came up with a great idea but spent all his energy getting his book out to publisher without the proper theories. Also he claims to take the responsibility to start the wave of the modern day real estate crash. In his book he refers to some stock exchange crashes and compares them with real estate. What is he thinking?
