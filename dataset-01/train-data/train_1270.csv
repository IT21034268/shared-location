3,Wow she looks pretty good,"The music was not too bad however Im impressed at how pretty she looks on the album cover...she is pretty hot for a bald chick. Just kidding! She looks good. I would love to hear her in a stripped down more American roots music. She does evoke a soulful, honesty in her vocals and I am glad she was not totally written off for her political views and that she is a good mom. Just my opinions and wish her the best of luck"
1,Horrible,"Sinead O'Connor is a perfect example of what's wrong with today's music industry. She can't sing or write songs and relies on her ""tough girl"" image to sell records. Enough!"
2,Disappointing,"Good singer, great songs -- so what went wrong? Some of the cuts are embarrassingly overproduced, and her singing here is just too thin to compete or be of much interest. If you go big band, you'd better go big voice too. After a listen, I put on a CD of Lena Horne singing Stormy Weather, just to remind myself how it's supposed to be."
4,Description,"Madelyn Grey expected to create a stir when she presented herself at the mansion of Owen Prince, governor of Kentucky and candidate for U.S. President, to announce that she was his long-lost daughter. But she could not anticipate the reaction of the governor's adopted son, Taylor Champion, a powerful newspaper publisher.Madelyn's unscheduled appearance and seemingly false claim aroused Taylor first to anger, then to something much deeper--potentially more dangerous and inescapably more demanding. Every other mystery, even the question of her own paternity, paled beside the mysterious hold he took on her heart."
3,Too delicate,"The surface on this product is too delicate for my taste, I find that after I've been working on it there are white spots in areas I didn't intentionally scratch off. I assumed at first this was my fault and took extra care to remove my ring and make sure there wasn't any dust or other particles on it that could get rubbed into it, but that didn't seem to make a difference.I'm willing to chalk it all up to a mistake and not get too worked up, but I would never buy this for a child who might get upset if something happens to their picture."
2,"Hard to use, brittle","Was not happy with this. Very brittle paper, hard to use. Ended up throwing it away.Would not suggest anyone purchase"
4,good for a lot of EMC/EMI pains,"I got this book because the boss said to find something to help resolve the FCC/CE and other world EMI/EMC compliance issues we have, and it was instantly used and had the answers we needed.It covers power and grounds, signal integrity, and used with Howard Johnson's book (High Speed Digital Design), gives a strong insight to the PC board layout issues of high speed digital and analog electronics."
5,My son loved this book at 9 months and is still his favorite,"Large colorful photo pictures that any child would love. You can follow along with different subjects on each page such as 'colors of nature' shows colored leaves of fall, brightly colored parrots, butterflies and fish. Also goes through shapes and patterns of nature, some counting, how things might feel, how animals might move ect. My son isn't even into most of these ideas at one year old but loves to point and listen to me say the names."
5,Baby Book,"I bought this book for a two year old little boy. He loves pictures of real things/people, but so many books with photographs have many words on the page, or to few pictures. This book was great. It is called a ""baby"" book, but the pages are thin so it's not very child - proof. Other than that it was absolutely perfect, and he loves it!"
2,"Some great songs, however...","What I like about The Fleshtones is the fact that they sound like an authentic ""garage band"". They can't help but sound the way they sound. It's as if these guys time-traveled from 1967:an era when thousands of lousy garage bands would play just for the fun of it. These guys are for real.Too bad most of the songwriting on this recording is also in that ""lousy garage band"" catagory. The best tracks are ""Let's Go"", ""One Less Step"", (both written by Ken Fox) and ""We'll Never Forget"" (written by K. Streng and P. Zaremba). The other tracks are quite forgettable and lack energy.I would recommend this album (if the price was right)if only to hear ""One Less Step"" and ""We'll Never Forget"" -- great songs.You might want to check out The Fleshtones' ""Beachhead"" CD (2005). The songwriting is consistently good throughout the recording. It's a blast!"
2,Thhe Origin of Lanchester Equations,"This is a reprint of the 1916 book by the inventor of the Lanchester equations. Here Lanchester advances his N-Square Law, which has become what we now refer to as Lanchester Equations. The interest of the book is its historical value, as better presentations are to be found elsewhere. There are other interesting portions of the book beyond the mathematics, such as ""aeroplane versus dirigible."" The book's value is as a historical record of both the advent of military aviation and military operations research."
3,need repair parts,"I have a health o meter ottoman leg massager that has a broken massage paddle, and health o meter does not carry parts for their equipment. Does anyone have a broken massager that they don't want, and I could salvage a part off of it to repair mine? The Model number is HM4120. Thanks Michael"
1,Awkward to use,"This product needs to be right up to the chair/sofa and it seems to sit too high for a 5'4"" person. Then the controls are located in front which means you can't reach it when it is pushed against the chair. I like ottomans that can double as extra seating and this is definitely not one that would support a person sitting on it. It is rather unattractive as well. I got it yesterday and sent it back today. As for the crucial functional part, I was unimpressed with the massage function. I guess I have been spoiled by the complete chair massagers as featured at Sharper Image Stores. In rereading the reviews, it appears most people who appreciate these type of machines have painful chronic foot problems which are helped. Otherwise for healthy people, I imagine just taking a walk would do as much for you. It was a very low price but in the end, I would not have wanted it for free. I was originally going to get it as gift for my mother, but it is too awkward for an older person to get into."
1,foot messager,"I am very disappointed in this purchase, it is not what I thought it was going to be. It is way too big & tall for the average person to sit at a confortable chair to use it. I tried to return it, but it was going to cost me more to send it back then I paid for it. Not happy at all, now I know why I like to shop in a store. At least there you know what you are buying."
4,Good book!,"I am a band teacher and was looking for a way to make my kids' practice time more focused. This workbook has given me lots of ideas that I can use to do just that! this is geared more towards private lessons in a homogeneous setting, but with slight alterations, it can work in a classroom setting as well."
1,Dried bread with cinnamon would taste better,I love Rice Cakes and tried Lundberg for the first time. Terrible!!There is no mosture in the cakes. The cinnamon taste terrible. I actually opened another pack to see if the first one was rotten but found the second to be the same way. Donated the rest to our homeless shelter.
3,Great inspiration for school research projects!,"I have used this and the other ""Ripley's"" books to inspire my students to do research projects. The students are captivated by the drawings and the odd facts presented. We have created a website using them!"
1,Think before spend $33.99 on these,"This fine musician and gentleman from France, had forgotwhat is to work to earn your money, The DVD video is a kindof sofisticated joke, of two eyes moving ?!""!!!The music is OK, but I bet you already known most of them.Please excuse my basic english, is a foreign language to me,but the message is clear, isn`t it ?"
5,Wait for the region 1 release,Fans of Jean-michel Jarre should wait for the U.S. release coming in February 2005. That version of Aero should play fine here.
1,Great music and artist - mislabeled product,"This item was advertised as having a DVD with NTSC region 0. THIS IS NOT CORRECT. Product DVD is PAL. Unknown region. It will not play on my USA DVD players. Tried 2 different players (Blu-ray and DVD). Neither will play it. Since I bought this primarily for the 5.1 mix in DTS, I am very disappointed."
2,DO NOT BUY THIS!!,"If you live in North America, the DVD will not play in our systems. Just buy the plain cd instead!!!!"
1,"Great CD, BUT DVD is only for European systems","I was very disappointed when I found the DVD would not work in my system. I didn't think to look at the packaging. I just assumed that Amazon would have been more upfront about selling a CD/DVD in the USA that was not compatible with USA DVD players or televisions.Beware if you want the DVD to work in your NTSC, Region 1 system. Otherwise, enjoy the CD as I did when I first heard it a few weeks ago in France."
1,IMPORT FROM FRANCE !,KEEP IN MIND WHEN PURCHASING THAT THE DVD OF THIS RELEASE HAS REGION 2 CODE DESIGNATION AND PAL SYSTEM RECORDING !RB
1,No advanced resolution here!,"Just to warn friends in US (it is in stores in Europe), there is no advanced resolution on this issue! No DVD-Audio, no SACD, just plain old CD, and DVD-Video multichanel sound with pair of eyes starring at you the whole time! Big disappointment, since it was advertised as 96kHz/24 bit, or Audio DVD, and Super Stereo CD.So expect good old 16 CD sound and lossy Dolby Digital!Maybe real DVD-Audio or SACD will be released later, since Aero was (allegedly) recorded in 96/24.That's why I haven't bought this 16 version, so have nothing to say about the music on this two discs"
3,An introduction to Verilog AMS,"I am new to verilog A and even newer to Verilog AMS. I thought the book was a reasonable introduction to the language, but I prefer a longer text with more content. The book is only of moderate length and expensive as seems to be typical of Kluwer texts. There are also some spots where clarity, at least to myself, was lacking. A user will need the Verilog AMS license from Cadence to use this language. Lacking such a license, I was never able to apply the mixed signal info from the text. For the pure Verilog A user who is doing only analog and not mixed signal sims, this book may not offer an advantage over Fitzpatrick's book even though it is newer. For the practicing engineer, this text is a far better way of getting introduced to Verilog AMS than Cadence's cryptic documentation."
2,Verilog AMS,"I design ADCs. I bought this book because we the tool became available to me at work. My first impression was underwhelming. However, as a reference book I have found it useful, and one of my associates borrows it also.This is about all that is available. It is useful."
4,"It's pretty good, actually","This book has no competition that I know of. There are no other books about Verilog-AMS so no relative comparison is possible. But I admit that I do not regret spending the money for my copy, and until something better comes along, you should too if you are expecting to do any work in Verilog-AMS.Note that this is not a text book in Analog/Mixed signal simulation in general. People planning to get this book really should know the generic basics already."
1,Item not as pictured,"I just received this bow & arrow set today. Although I was not expecting anything fancy-smancy with this kind of price tag, I was expecting something more along the lines of what the model is holding in the display picture. What I got instead is a cute little set measuring almost 20"" long. It would be about the right size for a 3-year-old. However, my 10-year-old isn't going to be all that thrilled when she sees it."
2,Only for the basics.,"I found the format of this DVD both distracting and not very effective. There seemed to be more animation than actual learning content. I did learn a few phrases but the DVD fails to combine words and phrases into valuable conversation topics. This DVD is best suited for children, not for adults who actually want to learn to speak Spanish."
4,Standard Spanish Gift Pack,"The two tapes .... but wait there is more! A high lighter, a cool box and pencil, and a notepad. On the surface these tapes can seem dumb and annoying, but then the next day when I'm sitting in Spanish class - budda bing - the stuff on the tape has lodged in my head. How do they do that!?!?!"
1,Is the price correct?,"This is not a review, because I've not read the book, nor could I afford to do it, given the stated price. I wonder, however, why the two reviewers failed to mention this fact. For that, perhaps one could have a dinner (and wine) at El Bullí instead."
2,Over Rated,"I purchased this book because it was recommended to me by Amazon. I am usually most pleased with these books, this book is the exception. I had a difficult time getting into to the book. It took almost three months to get to the third chapter, the book was too easy to put down. I found the book to be uninteresting and too disjointed to really enjoy. The characters were poorly developed and there was too much about the past life of the main character that was not explained or else glossed over to make the book seem interesting. All in all I would not recommend this book nor will I invest in what I am sure will be a forthcoming sequel."
3,"Good Idea, Disappointing Result","When I first read the glowing magazine and newspaper reviews of this book, I was drawn in by the idea of a mystery set in a retirement home and nursing center. But I found this a difficult book to read because there is very little dramatic tension, and the paragraphs are monotonous. I think that if the writer had developed scenes to tell the story, as opposed to telling most of it in narrative, the book would be more interesting."
2,Dreadful Soprano in rare work,"I have always been fond of this opera and was excited at the thought of finally seeing a production. Unfortunately I also had to hear it. The soprano is worse than Susan Kane. Indeed one can only assume that like that unhappy singer in Citizen Kane she must have been the producer's wife or girlfriend. She is quite pretty but the voice shakes more than a reed in the wind and is seldom on key. I have never heard a so-called professional who was that bad.The others are average, but next to her seem better than they are. If like me you want to be able to say you've seen this rarely performed work than rent it or buy the cheapest you can find. If you don't know the work then buy the CD with Domingo and Scotto and let this DVD go by."
3,Don't Be a Snob,"All right! It is not La Scala, or the Met, or Covent Garden. And it is not Fanciulla. Did you expect it to be? Take it for what it is. The negatives cited by some of the critics here are real, and need to be mentioned. But their tone is sometimes unfortunate. This production is very interesting as an example of early Puccini, with which many of us were unfamiliar. And it is a lot of fun with many saving graces. Opera is to be enjoyed, not always a race for technical perfection. So, sit back and enjoy it, warts and all. There is a lot to enjoy. I'm glad somebody brought it to us."
1,Sorry I purchased,"I love Puccini's operas and I understand that his early operas were not his best, but this DVD is not to my liking. The soprano is bad and the director doesn't seem to know what to do with his characters while onstage. Soomeday there might be a better recording. Until then..."
1,RIPOFF!,"Buyer Beware! This is NOT the ""Heart of Rock & Roll"" CD. This in fact is ""Collection"", which has next to nothing on it. While the CD cover is the same, the track listing is not. I for one, will not purchase from Import CD Specialists again. I spend way too much money with Amazon to have to deal with this garbage."
1,Disappointed,"The first disc has some value as it paces you through a massage, but there is little actual instruction involved. The second disc. . . not much to it of any worth."
3,Not all that impressed,"I am a certified Massage Therapist now working for a Chiropractor. I bought this DVD to get extra tips on neck and back areas. I was very disappointed in the presentation. The ""for professionals"" area for back offered very little insight and half the time the therapist's back was to me so I couldn't see the technique being used. Not top quality and certainly not advanced techniques."
1,Uses technical terms with very poor filming,"I recently ordered this DVD series so that a friend and I could learn about massage. Unfortunately, the lady on the tape uses a lot of technical / medical terminology that we did not understand. The filming was so poor that we could not generally see what she was doing to even try to mimic her. It was way too long for the amount of actual content that it contained--long amounts of time she just repeated what she did without explaining anything. The whole thing looked like a home video. I would NOT recommend this to anyone."
5,Great Package! Am buying as a gift for a friend!!,I bought this on DVD but am buying a VHS package for a friend as a gift. Im glad I found this combo pack instead of buying individually. The videos really are meant to go together. Good information for anyone whether you're in the business or just want to give a good massage to family and friends. It's easy to understand - easy to watch and having the DVD's on hand makes it great for showing to friends who want to know more about how I give such GREAT MASSAGES!!!! I recommend this to EVERYONE!
2,not quite what I was expecting,the smell was kind of dull. i was hoping that the smells would be more pungent but they were a little dull and blah smelling.
4,Lots of games for cheap,"Bought these to play while I'm away from home. Can't beat the price for all you get. The games work with VISTA, you just have to tone down the graphics if you have a discrete card - don't think any of them work with 32bit. Not any award winning games, but good for passing the time. Quick shipping and worth the price."
5,No bull short stories.,"Most if not all of the reviews here are accurate. I'll just say that it's a 5 star read, beautiful stories and incredible use of words. Stories are very simple and complex at the same time(how does she do that?)."
4,Stories with Heart,"These stories about the small-town life of rural New England more than lived up to the enticing professional reviews on the book cover. Each story grabbed me from the first sentence and never let go. For example, one story starts with: ""Two Jehovah's Witnesses, suffering in hot clothes, found the bodies a little before the cloudburst."""
3,Bag of tiny little boxes.,"This is somewhat my fault, but just so you're not fooled too: This is not 8 bags of raisins. It is 8 bags of little tiny boxes of raisins. Little, annoying, handful sized boxes.Good if you are a hockey mom packing your pre-schoolers' lunch, annoying if you are looking for a snack."
1,All about the taste,"I am sorry to say these cookies did not taste at all like sugar cookies. They were actually salty, and not nice and chewy. The only good thing is that they arrived in one piece, no crumbs. However it did not deliver on the taste. Iw ill no0t be ordering from Scott's items again."
1,Worse than disappointing,"I received this Land of Milk and Honey bath fizzy from my daughter, who usually buys the best gifts. This was disappointing -- worse than disappointing, actually. The scent was nothing special, and it created a scummy layer on the top of the bath. It left the tub slimy, so that I slipped getting up, and it left me sticky. I actually had to rewash myself. I'm not passing judgment on other ME! Bath ice cream fizzies, but in my experience, this one -- Land of Milk and Honey -- was terrible."
5,WOW,I bought this video along with meet the numbers for my 18 month daughter. She recognized almost all of the upper and lower case letters within 3 weeks!! I seriously didn't think these videos would work but it does. I highly recommend them and I always tell other mothers about it.I love it how she walks around singing her abc's and 123's.
5,BEST THING IN THE ENGISH LANGUAGE,WE GOT THIS FOR MY SON WHEN HE WAS THREE AND HE WATCHED IT S MUCH THAT I HAD TO BUY ANOTHER ONE FOR MY OTHER SON THAT IS 1. YOUR KIDS WILL LEARN THEIR ABC'S SO FAST WITH OR WITHOUT YOU TEACHING THEM JUST BY WATCHING THESE MOVIES . THEY ARE THE BEST .THANK YOU
3,abc video,as other reviews mentioned you must watch the video with your kids for them to get involved or they will think it is boring! overall it is good.
4,Letters Review,"My three year old liked the video for the first two weeks and his letter recognition has increased - he still isn't able to name them all (thinks q is p, etc). After two weeks, he is a little tired of it."
5,Meet the letters,wonderful. The children watch it over and over and learn more each time and laugh a lot.good resource for teachers
2,preschool tape,Found this to be very boring I wont buy another one. Mightas well record each letter in a repetative fashion. Might be a good way to learn but there has to be a better more fun way!
2,Too slow to hold attention,The animation and sound were too slow to hold my 2 year old's attention. Had the colors been brighter or the letters sung to a rhythm like the intro it might have been ok. Rented it to see if set was worth buying. May try again in a year.
2,Disapointed,You can't beat $9.99 for most DVDs and I am always looking for tools to help me teach my children new things. But I was disappointed in this product. I assumed it would teach all the letters AND their sounds. It doesn't. It only teaches letter recognition. I personally feel like they should be taught together. What good are letters without their sounds? I will still use the DVD but I will now watch it along with them to teach them the sounds. It would have been SO simple to add the letter sounds. Not sure why they didn't.
5,love it!!,"This dvd has definately helped my 5 year old! A week ago he could not even sing the alphabet song even though I had worked with him constantly, now he sings the song and is starting to have letter recoginition! My 3 year old he already sang ABC song loves it as well and is able to recognize letters already! My 10 month old will watch it for a little bit at a time and claps and laughs! If your child is struggling with their letter I highly reccomend this dvd!"
2,Very repetitive,Maybe my Son is to young for this(2 years old) but this movie doesn't engage him for very long. It's a bit to repetitive for grown ups to watch with him. He will start repeating some of the letters after a while of watching though.
5,Great video,"This video does a great job capturing the attention of my 4 boys. The two oldest are too old for it, but they still enjoy watching it and helping their younger brothers learn."
2,my kids cry when i put these on...,"Repetitive and disappointing. Graphics and sounds are plain. This is for babies, toddlers are not interested."
5,Awesome Product,"I have given this product to someone who has a 2 year old. She was sooo suprise with this product. She reported that he started saying the letters within 2 weeks and by the end of the month he already knew all the letters. She also said that she bought meet the colors,shapes and numbers and within 2 weeks of watching those he knew them all. He is only 2. She said she is going to buy meet the sight words next."
5,EXCELENTE PARA NINOS EN ESCUELA BILINGUE,"Compramos este Dvd para reforzar el idioma ingles en nuestro hijo de 3 yrs.que asiste a una escuela bilingue, lo recomendamos ampliamente, aprendio todas letras en tan solo 1 semana viendolo diario, es un video repetitivo con musica e imagenes divertidas para los ninos, la pronunciacion de cada letra es muy buena leta y rapida para que los ninos la repitan adecuadamente, incluye la cancion del ABC'S, Flashcards y modo salteado para que aprendan no solo las letras de corrido si no que tambien las reconoscan si estan revueltas EXCELENTE!"
2,Doesn't Keep my Toddler's Attention,"My 23 month old is not interested in this DVD at all. I went and bought the LeapFrog Letter Factory DVD, and she's much more interested in that one."
2,"Letters, yes, concepts NO","I don't deny that this series is entertaining, especially for VERY young children. My little one is 11 months, and when I put on any of the preschool prep series, he enjoys it. However.....how am I supposed to teach him ""G"" when I can't figure out myself what the animation is doing? Goggles? Gripping? Grabbing? Glasses? And ""E"" is such a stretch Earring? Elegant? ????? Not to mention ""O"" - my husband and I still look at it and go ""hmmmph?"" I want my son to be imaginative while learning, but this is a bit off base. What happened to good ol' elephant or egg for E and grass or giraffe for G? A big mistake on Preschool Prep's part I believe."
2,Did not hold their attention,"My twin 2yr olds liked this one a bit, but I think they found this boring since they stopped paying attention even on their first time watching it. They like the Leap Letter Factory a lot better. They have been watching Letter Factory for a few weeks and still love it. I am sure Meet the Letters is more educational, but if the don't watch it won't help anyway."
2,"Loves meet the colors, hates meet the letters","My daughter will not watch this dvd, while ""meet the colors"" is her all time favorite dvd. This one is MUCH slower in pace, so be prepared."
3,Great Content but Not So Great Disc Quality,"I bought four discs: meet the letters, meet the colors, meet the shapes, and meet the numbers.My 19 months old little one started to really like ""Meet the Letters"" two months ago. We played this video everyday for 0.5-2 hours daily most time. Last week we went on vacation and occasionally played the disc continuously 3-4 hours to keep the little one occupied during lunch or dinner time. As a result, the disc could not be recognized by the DVD player now.I didn't expect this disc to work for ever, but the life span was far shorter than anticipated. Just in case, I plan to backup the other 3 discs content in my hard drive."
3,So - So,"I have mixed feelings about this dvd. Its pretty dry. It just repeats the letters over and over again. H....H.....H.....H...H Its pretty annoying if you're the parent listening to it too. But, I'll admit she does sit there and watch it for awhile. We haven't made it thru the whole thing yet. We make to like H and she loses attention. So, i would say its good and bad. I would prob try buying something else."
2,Boring but somewhat efficient...,I bought this product to reinforce uppercase letter learning for my 4 year old. It is beyond boring and some of the concepts don't correlate well with the letters. He became confused and mislead by the meaning of many letters. I have to sit and watch the dvd with him just to make sure he understands what word the letters represent. I personally think this dvd is geared more towards a child under the age of 2.
4,Good but can be improved.,"I got this DVD for the first time when my boys were just 2 yrs old. At that time it didnt seem to interest them much.I again got it for them 5 months later when they had started to recognise letters and this time it was a hit with them. They loved it and they learnt to recognise all the letters very soon. My only gripe with this DVD has been that they don't say the example aloud that they show for each letter, like for W they show both Well and Water which is a good thing since kids learn two words starting with the letter W. But, they only show the pictures of well and water and don't say it aloud for the kids to relate to. There is some music playing in the background when they show the examples."
1,"Don't waste your money and time, even if it is free","Worst software I have ever used. It requires activation - must have learned that technique from Intuit TurboTax. For whatever reason the activation didn't work - system error, asked me to email their support. When I emailed and called their support, they are only interested in charging me $X.XX per incident. Buy this software only if you want to test your patience."
3,A Quirky Story with elements of a Horror movie,This is a quirky little story about a group of girls in an all girl's school. The movie contains elements of horror that appear in the last act but they fail to frighten and really are more of the ghostly bump in the night variety. Less horror than supernatural goings-on that could just as easily have been left out of the story.I went into this movie expecting horror and got a story about close friends and sometime lovers at an all girl's school and what happens both after and before a young girl commits suicide. The story is fairly involving and I had no problem sticking around to the end but I can't recommend it as strongly as the other reviewers. It was okay. Frankly the story could have been told without the strangeness and it would have been more effective. The horror elements were pretty limp and were not central to the story.
4,Not a horror movie,"I'm pretty sure there are very few korean films with a focus on a lesbian couple... Considering that, the movie is enjoyable with good acting and a sweet little hidden relationship that turns dark. For me, most asian movies tend to have their moments but never really tie it together in the end... In this case it feels like there could have been more, something more full circle. ***THE KICKER is that some scenes were cut out of the movie, including a bathtub scene, But there is a (Korean ver. only) 6-disc special edition of this movie available for about $49-60 online with many extras and special packaging which I DO give five stars."
1,A Very Bland Attempt,"Memento Mori is a very bland attempt at invoking horror in the jealous rage of preteen relationships. At no point did the movie provoke any late night viewing fears, nor any interest at all. The only emotion that held me to finish the movie was the fact that I had dished out 20 odd dollars to buy this DVD. For similar, more compelling films try Mulholland Drive. It works off a similar story line, however adds comedy, intellect, and suspense."
5,"BEST OF THE THREE ""WHISPERING CORRIDORS"" FILMS","You can refer to my review of WHISPERING CORRIDORS DVD to get an overall review of how much I like these three Korean High School Ghost Story films. I think this is the best of the three. Beautifully acted, well photographed, great multi-layered story. This film also gives us a look at day-to-day Korean culture, which is a big selling point. Any film that enhances our understanding of other people is valuable, and this is one such film. The Schoolroom set is so well done that I thought they were filming in a real-world location. Not much else to say that already hasn't been said, but check this movie out - you won't be disappointed."
5,Are you kidding me ?,"Come on! Let`s get serious: This can`t be STARZ.STARZ ! The legendary band of long forgotten ages. The band that inspired big selling bands like Motley Crue and a legion of cult-followers from the seventies to the present, desperatly seeking for new material.Again: It just can`t be!We are talking a 70s-band here. Or ... are we ?They can`t just sound like this, can`t rock like this, can`t burn (or should I say SHINE ?) like this. Period !So ... this must be a new band, some new ""Boys in action"" playing some kind of real ""Coliseum Rock"".No ""Requiem"" needed.So take on your ""X-Rax Specs"", activate the ""Live wire"" and grap your very own ""Detroit girl"". And foremost: Never ever ""Pull the plug"" again.Finaly; ""It's a Riot"" (Read: BUY IT !!!)."
3,good but not great,I purchased this sign as a Christmas gift and was not overly impressed. I was expecting a little more substance. The quality of the piece is very good.
4,Very nice!,"Bought as a gift for communion/confirmation and sent to a friend. I did not actually see the product but it was well-received. I would have liked to have ""inside"" dimensions of the box as well so I would have had a better idea of what I could have included as a gift item to go along with the keepsake box...also the ability to gift wrap the item."
2,Rape and more Rape,"I don't know why. but a Hentai where the protagonist is raped by alien demon tentacle monsters is great fun, but when the rapists are human it is distasteful to me. But there it is, this is too close to reality for my liking and as such I only give it 2 stars."
1,Being A Head Coach Is This Boring?????,"This game is just plain boring!I had no idea being a head NFL coach would be this boring.If you like sitting in meetings, answering the phone and reading emails....this game is for you.All of the tasks that are required of you take forever to do...even reading emails takes several steps.When you finally get to coach a game....IT IS BORING!!!!!!Complete waste of time and money.Save time and money to just play the regular EA College Football games or Madden Games."
1,BORING,"This is a horrible game. I played Madden for the strategy part, and I was really looking forward to this game. But as the other reviewer said it takes forever to do anything. I gave it 30 minutes and didn't even get past the tedious introduction. Boring, boring, boring. And from reading your reviews, it doesn't seem like I want to spend another 9 1/2 hours to get to a lame game."
1,"Should be titled ""NFL Bad Hoax""","Everything written here about this game is amusingly true. I cannot figure out what EA was thinking by creating this game. For those familiar with Madden 2006 the interface is alot like Superstar mode only more restrictive. The ""Superstar"" and ""Head Coach"" concepts are intriguing, but EA should stick with what has worked for years. Their franchise mode is WAY more user friendly than it is in NFL Head Coach. I love Madden's Franchise mode and if EA had set up NFL Head Coach under that format I think the game would be much more successful. Better yet, just include ""Coaching Mode"" as part of the Madden 2008 game. Now that would be cool!"
1,How do you make Madden football boring? Here's how!,"Not only is this game slow and tedious, it inexplicably takes a preposterous amount of time to load each sequence. Your actions are broken down into calendar events (2:00 design new offensive strategy; 3:30 sign free agent cornerback), and each event would take a minimum of 30 seconds, and often longer. This is despite the fact that it was being played on a state-of-the-art gaming computer. The small pleasures in this game (and there are a few) are ruined when you have to wait three minutes of real time until the next event.Definitely not recommended."
3,good but not amazing,"As a manager and coach program the game is really good, but the fun factor is missing for me, yet. You gotta do so much busy work in your office hours etc. but sometimes you don't have to do nothing, so..."
5,Good is he good! Contempaorary in theology. Prayerful spirit,"Fr. Fehren offers deep thought, personal challenges, and readable copy. Rich in spiritual reference and in touch with the Catholic in the pew, this pastor never disapoints and ever suprises. God is he good! His writing consistently touch the head and heart. Concrete detail, contemporary in theology and prayerful in spirit. Millions of people live on the fringes of the church. Some have been hurt by the clergy. Others are angry and frustrated with church rules. Still others just drifited away, meet Father Henry Fehren. Through these provacative essays he takes up the cause of the marginal Catholic. He pokes at rules. He lambastes rigid bureaucracies. All the while insisting that Jesus is the core of faith. A great disscusion-starting tool for any alienated Catholic, Remembering Church, or faith-sharing group."
5,The Italian Comedy,"I am so pleased to have found this excellent book on Commedia Dell'Arte! We provide authentic Italian masks for performers, students and collectors all over the world and are frequently asked for more information. We highly recommend this comprehensive work by Duchartre, and will refer inquiries to Amazon for purchase now that we have located a source for the book. We invite you to visit us at [...] where you will find all the characters from The Italian Comedy brought to life."
4,The best of Mamet (along with Glen Garry),"This is probably Mamet's best work, in my opinion, since he focuses on truthful characters without the rather contrived repartee of many of his other plays in which he seems to attempt to develop some metrical dramturgical quirkiness to provide the viewer/reader with a sense of originality. I find Mamet's screenplays usually better than his plays, try The Spanish Prisoner for example. But in Speed the Plow, he provides us with fully fleshed characters who speak like real people (with the necessary artistic license and not so hung up about verbal pyrotechnics. By the way, his style is obviously influenced by studies with Sandy Meisner from the Neighborhood Playhouse. Read the book in the the year of the life of Sandy Meisner ""Meisner on Acting"" and you'll see the acting exercises that influenced Mamet's writings."
2,Speed The Plow,The style of writing is difficult to follow; e.g. characters constantly interrupting characters in mid-sentence. Timing would be critical for actors or the audience could easily get lost.
2,took toooo long to receive - returned to sender,"play ""speed the plow"" - ordered 10/30/08 - received 11/28/08 - received a copy - could have been from amazon - within 3 days after inquiring - returned first order ""return to sender"". hope I don't get billed for two.Hope don't have order go through amazon again."
3,"Back to work on this, kids ...","It's simple and painless, but not perfection. In fact, as another reviewer noted, it often sounds as if no experienced Italian speaker was around for the final edit. The Deviants cast read the prompter well, but there are inconsistencies in pronunciation that might confuse a novice - and this really is beginner's level. I studied Italian with a native-speaking Italian tutor, and am a Spanish speaker, so I warn newbies that consistency is really important, and it's lacking here. With no expert was on hand to fix the mistakes, or catch simple nuances that are missing, you might learn a few things you have to unlearn later. Many of the company have no command of the language at all - it's funny to hear a guy say he speaks ""only Italian"" with a heavy American accent. To sum up, not a waste of time, but hardly a gem."
1,Too Much English. Not enough Italian,"This DVD is heavy on the English and short on the Italian. It spends way too much time on the word ""ciao"" and cute skits(mostly in English) on its pronunciation. Meanwhile, it givesyou a very complicated set of rules (again primarily in English) for the pronunciation of vowels and consonant combinations which it whips through in blinding speed and are probably only appropriate for persons wishing to major in Italian as a career. Its very short on vocabulary building and you will learn only a very few words of Italian and Italian phrases. Its filled with fluff and skits which try to be cute (and usually fail) and are mostly in English. I really cannot recommend this DVD to anyone. You won't learn much Italian words and phrases from it."
2,Italian basics taught by native english speakers,"If you are looking for an extremely basic Italian lesson this is it. The tape covers the following:1. Italian alphabet2. Pronouncing vowels3. Pronoucing consonants and double consonants4. The formal/informal distinctions5. Days of the week6. Months7. Numbers to 1008. Subject PronounsBeyond this there is very little on the DVD.Pros:1. It covers the basics in detail2. Since it is a DVD you will see the word while hearing the word which is usefulCons:1. There in not enough on the DVD for even a basic conversation2. The DVD is taught by native English speakers so the accent is not correct.Overall, I do not recommend this DVD unless you have no background with Italian. However, if you are looking for something that covers the most rudimentary basics you might enjoy this DVD. Just be warned, it will teach you Italian as spoken by Americans not by Italians."
2,Speak Italian like an American,"While watching this DVD, I have discovered several inconsistencies (and I haven't even finished it yet). I was hoping to learn Italian in an entertaining way, and to learn to speak it like a native (with correct pronunciation and emphasis). They got it half right. The DVD effectively uses visuals, repetition, and dialogue to make learning some basic Italian easy and memorable. But in the first three lessons I have already found a multitude of examples of words or letters that were pronounced in at least two different ways each, which is sloppy, to say the least. The problem for a new student is knowing which is the CORRECT pronunciation (and, YES, there IS a correct pronunciation). I will have to rely on OTHER sources to teach me which is the correct pronunciation. I wonder how much else they got wrong? Ultimately, there are some valuable tidbits of information on this DVD, but don't expect to sound like anything but an American speaking Italian."
1,Not worth the money,"Learning a language is difficult enought without all the ""cute"" comments and bits in this DVD. You can learn as much, for a lot less money, from an Italian phrase book."
3,It Got Me Started,"It is very simple, but if you are just starting, as I was, simple can be a good thing. It's unlikely this DVD alone will have you speaking Italian, but it will give you a foundation. It explains the rules for pronouncing words as they are spelled, and offers a small starter vocabulary and some grammar. I used it as part of a larger program that included a variety of books and tapes. It is not as detailed as the second DVD in the series, and you probably skip this one go to the second one if you have already started with other materials. Still, I enjoyed it."
3,Way too sweet,"These pickles contain so much sugar I was convinced they were bread and butter pickles until I carefully re-read the description. According to the label, there is more sugar than vinegar, in fact more sugar than anything else but cucumbers. Nevertheless I did enjoy them, but I'm not sure I'll order them again.As a connoisseur of hot foods (especially pickled ones), I found them hot enough to have a definite and lingering bite, though not hot enough to make my eyes tear. I'd probably call them a medium on a Texas scale, beyond hot on the New England scale."
5,They never sounded better!,"This is the best recording that Geoff Moore and the Distance ever produced, barely edging above _Home Run_ for that prestigious distinction. This CD has it all--the catchy, creative title track, the blood-pumping ""Godgottaholdonme,"" the tender ""If You Could See What I See,"" a lotsa-fun remake of the goldie oldie ""I Can See Clearly Now,"" the stirring anthem ""That's When I'll Know I'm Home,"" the quiet, humble ""When All is Said and Done."" Not a single track of this CD misses the bullseye, and all fans will be familiar with the classic rocker ""Why Should the Devil."" Anyone who likes even a single song of GMD needs to buy this now while they still can--it won't be around for long!"
3,Okay socks,"After a few washes, the fabric is starting to get a strange texture - lint is appearing on the surface. I don't have that problem with the Hanes brand. But besides that, these are okay socks for the price."
2,When wash in the washing machine the socks burst some threads are producing spots,"When wash in the washing machine the socks burst some threads are producing spots, need to improve product quality. Thanks"
1,Bad Quality,These socks all of a sudden lost their elasticity almost at the same time after a wash. They became unusable. Must be some quality issues with the material used.
1,It is more polyester than cotton,"I do not like these socks. I do not feel confortable. It looks dirty even thoght you wash it.I play tennis and I had used the Hanes socks and I can asure anyone than Hanes are more better than Addidas I prefer the Hanes socks, they have more cotton. I will not buy these products again."
3,Thin material for a crew sock,"The product description says that this is a ""Half cushion cotton crew"". A more accurate description would be ""BARELY cushioned"" cotton crew. I need socks with good cushioning for the sole, and these definitely do not qualify. The material on the bottom of these socks is about as thick as an average crew sock, and the material on the top of the foot is quite thin. If you like thin socks and you don't need socks with well-cushioned soles, then these might be acceptable. For me, they're not going to be of much use. The one good thing that I can say about these is that the toe seams are pretty thin."
1,way too small,I wear size 12 shoes....I could barely get the socks on. They stopped circulation in my feet. I gave socks to my wife who wears size 7.5 and they are tight for her. TUrned out to be a waste of money.
2,changed quality,These socks used to be the best. They have changed them and now they are more cheaply made. Very unfortunate.
4,A trustworthy Teacher.,"Though delivered over sixty years ago at Westminster Chapel, London, still these sermons remain as fresh and as penetrating today as when they were first given. A trustworthy teacher and reliable guide in the most difficult areas of faith, Lloyd-Jones' commitment to biblical truth as well as his remarkable understanding of God's ways in the world renders him doubly qualified to address the question: ""Why does God allow War?"" In addition, the origin of these sermons in the tumult of World War II, together with the testimony of many who have been helped by the Doctor's honest facing up to the problems of sin, suffering, war and evil, converge to make this small work a source of proven help and far more than a recitation of pat answers. Encouraging and God-affirming, this booklet would be a fine addition to most collections addressing the problem of suffering and evil."
1,"Utter Garbage. For Shame, GoFit!","The wheels on this thing are PLASTIC! I was hoping at the very least that the treads would be rubberized.The two wheels flop around together in the middle, and my hands barely fit onto the grips, which are way too narrow. The whole thing feels entirely flimsy and inspires no confidence or delight in exercise whatsoever.Total piece of trash.I suppose it still does the same job as anything else, but come on. A little quality is all I ask.B"
2,"Flimsy, unstable","I find this wheel very flimsy and unstable. The wheel fits too loosely on the tube. Sure it's one of the cheapest available, but the price difference with others is very small. If I had the opportunity, I would spend an extra $10 for a (hopefully) more sturdy product. Still, it does the job."
3,"It's simple, it rolls, and you have to use your own body weight.","This product will put a lot of strain on your arms, back and abs. It's not just an abs workout. Since it's just a simple bar with 2 plastic (yet durable) wheels, you have to do all the work both on the way down and up. It has no spring action. It took me a while to get used to it but it works! You will feel the burn in your abs the next day after your first try. I have to use a pillow on my knees to do this exercise otherwise it will hurt. I use it both on wooden flooring and carpeted floors and works fine without damaging either flooring. Most of the time I feel like am getting a workout mostly in my arms but it's part of my abs routine."
1,Trash,"1) It came with horrible stench emitting from it, the smell of rotting robber in an enclosed place. When using the item, the smell transfered to my hands. It took five minutes of scrubbing for my hands to stop smelling. I left it in an airtight bag with cat liter and baking soda for a week; that lesson the smell somewhat.2) After about a week of using it for five minutes every other day, the outer rubber part of the wheel slipped off in the middle of my Tabata routine. While trying to fix it, I noticed the foam handles were disintegrating, leaving a black powder.If you order these, the best you can expect is to have wasted your money. It is likely the smell and the powder are both toxic."
4,does the job,quality is good.only thing is u must not lean on either side or else the wheel will move towards yor hand. idk if there are other wheels that r the same or if just this 1. it is because there is nothing to hold the wheel in place.
2,Not so good,"Good:- Affordable.- Padded handles are great. They provide a nice grip.- The wheel if very light.- It's small and easy to store.Bad:- Assembly was not so easy... it was a lot of strenght involved in order to make pieces fit ""all the way"".- I don't like that the wheel is plastic.- What is really missing is that this model does not have a spring which will help you go back to original position. You need to use your own muscles to get back, and this puts much strain on the back.- Wheel seems not to be very well ""greased"", so you need to put much strenght in order to push/pull yourself.My husband and me used it few times, but found that instead of good workout, we end up with back pains... so we are not using it any more.Now I'm sorry that I choose this one... I wish I went for one of better quality excercise wheels."
3,Enjoyable banter but little substance,This is the first of these novels I've read. I was rather surprised that this is not actually sci-fi. I'm not quite sure how to classify this but there is not a single original sci-fi element I could identify in this book. It could be a romance but there was not really much of that either. The book is mostly about the internal anguish of the main character who just keeps whining and whining (and getting drunk) because he has to take a bit of a break from being a swashbuckling superhero.In fairness I found this a tolerable read and turned the pages quickly. It was not until it was over that and I reflected on what I had just read that I realised that nothing of any importance at all had happened in this book. It is of course always possible that if I had read the other novels in the series I would have `got it'.
4,Rocking and catchy as hell.,"""She Got Me"" just jumps out of the speakers. I am glad I had my system up ""loud"" when this came on RadioParadise.com. When I first heard it, I thought it was ""Ghost of a Texas Ladies Man"" from Concrete Blonde. Then as it went on, thoughts of a the best of the 70's ""boogie"" bands crossed with some of the harder rocking alt.country seemed to me the best way to describe this.This is really a cool sound."
5,Best of the 90s and one of my favorites!,"I might have never discovered this great record if I had not been flipping through TV channels one afternoon with my roommate and saw three guys doing an acoustic jam on some obscure TV talk show. My friend said, ""check the drummer out."" It was Ginger Baker (we're both Cream fans) playing some cardboard boxes and a coffee cup. Pretty amazing stuff. Then he found the CD in a store and we both proceeded to wear the disc out for the next five years or so. We parted ways amicably and he took his CD with him. I hadn't heard it in almost a decade when I found it on Amazon and ordered it immediately. Still sounds as good as it did 15 years ago and even sounds great without weed! One of the best rock albums ever!My iPod just got a little cooler."
5,5 stars is too little!!!!,"Was it only yesterday that Kurt Loder announced on MTV news that Ginger Baker was added to the lineup.....and then I never gave it another thought. And then one day, a buddy running a record store got this cd in a bunch of discs to be sold as used. He instantly included it in a package of other stuff and sent it off to me. Upon my first listen, I became not only hooked, but convinced that this was one THE greater recordings out of the '90s. Very seldom does a a great band get reincarnated. For a fleeting moment, Cream was alive and well. Ginger (God, I love that name!) is drummin as well as ever (take a listen to BBM's Around the Next Dream for continued proof)."
2,Would've been a great album.,"I know I will catch hell from Masters Of Reality fans, but I was really dissapointed with this album. I thought it would be a bass-heavy album with some killer riffs and some stoned out jams. At least that was my impression when I heard that Chris Goss, the leader of Masters Of Reality, produced Kyuss' best album, Blues For The Red Sun. But I was wrong. The production is way too 80's for me. The guitar isn't that heavy, and the drums don't sound like drums. Some songs I really like, such as She Got Me When She Got Her Dress On, and Jody Sings, but the bulk of it is bad late 70's rock. I guess I didn't catch on. You might like it though."
2,Tennessee Atlas and Gazetteer,I have ordered many of these. This one has a serious problem with pages missing. Of course we realized this when we were in Tennessee and decided to go for a ride. Can I have a new one??
1,Defective print run,"Delorme gazeteers are wonderful products. However, Amazon seems to have purchased a defective print run on this one. Several pages are repeated while the next in sequence are missing. I reported this to Amazon and ordered a replacement. The replacement had the same problem. I returned both. I will find a map store where I can actually look at what I am buying before purchasing another one."
3,See my review on the Kentucky Atlas & Gazetteer,"See my review on the Kentucky Atlas & Gazetteer. Bottom line: a great product if you are running for County Commissioner, Representative, or Senator."
4,Folkrock that comes right from the heart...,"On this cd Buffy Sainte-Marie makes inspiring music with a socio-critical undertone, underlined by a strong voice that betrays inner rage. The album has a good balance between upbeat songs and ballads."
5,Honest Inquiry to Buffy Sainte-Marie Fans,"I heard ""Starwalker"" and a song that has the words, ""Wrap me in your blanket, and dance me around...take me back to where my heart belongs...in the Valley of Sasquechwan,"" while up in Mt.Shasta, California, visiting a friend who had an old album. Since then, I have done research online which seems to indicate that this elusive album which contains both songs no longer exists or has been discontinued, inaccessible to the public.[...]"
2,Okay for a quick read,"I myself work in a juvenille boot camp and found this story very unrealistic and it danced the edge of inappropriateness. First of all, a juvenille with the record such a Grace's would never comply so easily and secondly a youth would never be permitted to stay in a counselor's living space for such a long period of time.But if you are not a realist and looking for a quick read about two people falling in love- it's worth the time."
5,"Wonderful Book, Very Enjoyable Read!","The story of Grace and Carey's relationship starts out pretty ruff! Grace is sent to boot camp and Carey is the drill sargent from hell(Queen Bitch is how Grace refers to her). Grace has built up walls around her heart and soul that might take Carey and a few push-ups to knock down. Carey knows that there has to be a reason for Grace's bad behavior but, will Grace ever let anyone in to help her? Can a girl with a troubled past turn her life around and achieve her heart's greatest desires? This book is a great read! I really liked the story and all of the characters were well writen. I found it humorous in spots and very endearing in most! I would like to see a sequel to this book and see just where life has taken our young Grace and big-hearted drill sargent Carey. I highly recommend this book and it will stay in my collection to read again!"
4,Graceful Waters,"The novel was more emotional than I expected. I read the whole thing in 11 hours over one day because I could not put it down. It made me laugh and cry and had really good depth that helped me to connect with the characters. The finish was quite sudden but it was a fitting end, it was the type of ending that you want. But then again when you get what you want it's kind of sad because you know there wont be a sequel. All in all I really enjoyed it :)"
5,Frequency (Db Boulevard) is palya!,"In the language of the Pitjantjatjara (Aboriginal) people of Central Australia, palya means ""good"" which really means ""the best"". I bought the CD on the strength of one track, ""Point of View"" - which is a masterpiece. The tinkling, beguiling opening, slowly building with the background percussion swelling, and then that driving, thumping rhythm before Mooney launches into the vocals, is just mesmerising, an aural feast - I listen to it over and over. It reminds me so much of Ravel's ""Bolero"". The rest of the CD is an excellent mix of vocal and instrumental styles, but always consistently underpinned by the percussion. If there is one very niggling comment, it is that ""Point of View"" is such an outstanding track, and keeps hauling you back for more, more, more, that you tend to overlook the rest. Mooney has nailed that song!"
5,Hope For Fibromyalgia,This book provided me with tons of useful infomration about the impact of fibromyalgia on my life. For the first time I was able to understand the direct connections between what is going on in my body and how I feel. I liked how the book personalizes the fibromyalgia experience by outlining the different types of fibromyalgia that people experience and then clearly explaining daily treatment approaches. In figuring out what type of fibromyalgia pain I was experiencing I then used the suggestions in the book to create a personalize plan for self-care that is having a positive impact on my life. I recommend this book for anyone who wants information and positive solutions for dealing with fibromyalgia.
5,good series odd ending,"ok this all about obtaining the hero's genes through well .. sex or marriage , there is fan service and some sexual situations but nothing to dirty, its more comedy and romance. the 3 girls basically fall for him and his child hood friends pops in and loves him too. its a good anime well done animation. ending is odd and i wished we had a season 2 and not the weird ending we were stuck with but oh-well.youll enjoy this series and re-watch it time and time again."
2,People are way too generous with 5 star ratings,"Maburaho is well drawn. The story is sub par and boring at times. The humor isn't that funny, unless maybe if you're a highschool girl who hasn't been ""around the block"" a few times. Just to establish what I think of as a funny anime so you know where I'm coming from--- GTO is funny. This is, at most, cute. It may be that I'm not in to ""Harem"" comedies. I find animes with shy, sexually repressed male protagonists who get smacked around by their female counterpoints annoying. If you're a masochistic guy or a girl who likes to dress up in cosplay costumes, you'll love this. If you have any self esteem, you should take a pass."
4,"Kinda old school, but cool beats!","High points, ""Hot Summer Days"" ""Westcoast Player for Life"" Needs more guest appearances."" Looking forward to a new project."
4,Beautiful white dress,"My sister actually bought this for our baby for her baby blessing, and it is absolutely beautiful and cute. Several people at church commented on how pretty it was and how precious our baby girl was in it. The only down-side is that after hand washing it due to our baby drooling on it (she was teething), the center butterfly on the bodice came off. Because of this, I discovered that the butterflies are just hot-glued on. It will be simple enough to hot glue back on, but I was surprised by it. And I only used slightly warm water. BUT, it is really pretty and we are happy that we have it. It was perfect for her blessing. The headband looked great with it, too."
1,poor customer service,"ordered these dresses back in October for my 11 month old twins for Christmas cards. One of the dresses came with the tulle torn. I have made multiple attempts to contact webbdirect2u. Over the phone, a representative stated she would send another dress to replace the torn one. The replacement never arrived and I cannot get any further response from the company. It is now December 6. While the dresses are quite attractive, the material is of poor quality. Also, my daughters do not have sensitive skin, but the material is so scratchy, it left their skin very red and blotchy."
5,Monty Python- That's all I need to say.,"Okay, this is a great gift item. You get three 90-minute videos packed with some classic python sketches. Most of these episodes come from the epic third season, where the exploits of the python clan leaked into america and poisoned an entire generation's minds with skits regarding dead parrots, cheese, and a strange man by the name of 'Gumby'..."
3,"Nice for the basics, but...","Great umbrella-style stroller for a throw & go and for traveling on vacation, but if you are looking for an everyday stroller - consider others.The Jeep Double is one of the cheapest, which is nice on the pocket book. Plus it is simple to fold and steer. And the mesh seats are very cool, kids don't sweat in the sun.But the three point harness does not hold two active under-two's, and mine are pretty well behaved! The sun canopy likes to pop off each time I set it in my trunk (a nuisance) and the latch to hold it shut no longer catches well. The cupholder also doesn't stay attached. And is too small for a water bottle - better for a coffee cup (but no one should be putting a hot cup over their kids heads on a walk!).I've only had the Jeep for two months, but am now looking for something sturdier and wth a 5 pt. harness."
1,Mommy to 3 under 3,"I have had this stroller for over 2 years and very quickly after I bought it, i noticed the metal bars on the bottom back started to rust. We have always stored it indoors, never in the rain... so I was surprised. Last year the metal bar broke under one the seats, so the stroller would not stay open, and my husband had to get a new screw and put it together. At this point, I am online trying to find another inexpensive double stroller b/c I am embarrassed to take this anywhere b/c it is so rusty! I don't want to spend a lot since my twins are now 3 and the baby is 1yr old, so hopefully our days of double strollers are numbered and we can get away with a single to most places. Plus we have a valco double with the toddler seat attachment and only use the Jeep if we want to have a small, compact, lightweight option.Would have spent more and opted for a double umbrella stroller that would have lasted the whole time we need one!"
3,I'm in the book....,They spelled my name wrong and left out the most interesting part of my involvement.....................
5,Dawn of the scientific era,This is a history not to be missed discussed to a faretherwell as the excitement and inspiration of open scientific explorations became the attraction opening the door to science full out for sale. Seeing became believing when believing called for seeing. Kary Mullis's TED appearance sold me on this book and more.
5,See; Simon DOES know what he's talking about ;-),"This group is phenomenal. Their voices and harmonies are excellent and they sound and look great. This cd is really good and it's been a long wait to actually 'see' them perform. I'm not usually a fan of opera, but these guys bring about something special to this genre and some of it might be to do with their look and their youth, but I don't think anyone could really deny the talent these guys have. See, Simon is usually correct. This is a great dvd."
3,"Great, just different than I expected","The music is excellent, the scenery is fitting for the magnificent voices. I had hoped this would be more of a long play concert, but there were only a few songs in the regular track of the DVD. You have to navigate through a couple sub menus to play videos, commentaries, etc. I was hoping for something that you could just hit play and let it play for a long time, but this DVD requires some more fiddling to get the music. That's fine if you're sitting to watch it, but less helpful if you wanted it to just play for a while in the background."
3,Short but sweet,"The performance was beautiful - wonderful. But I was really surprised and disappointed that there were only five songs on the DVD. I hadn't realized when buying it that it was such a ""mini"" performance. Other than that, though, it was very lovely."
2,Not Worthy for the Money paid,"The performance is very good, BUT, it only has 5 SONGS only. The DVD should state HOW MANY songs included in this ""Encore"" DVD! I felt like being cheated for the money I paid; I expected to see a ""normal length"" of performance... (It's NOT!)"
4,Il Divo Encore,Fascinating. I wanted to know how Il Divo came to be and this explains it along with a number of their great performances. Same songs as Il Divo Live. A great pair and well worth the money.
5,A Question for Il Divo reviewers,"I heard this group on youtube and thought I would like a DVD of their music. All reviews of DVDs indicate too much chatter and too little music. Also questionable stereo sound. Does anyone know of a DVD of their musical performance that can be viewed as a ""program?"" I'm not sure what is meant by having to negotiate to find music etc. I know that is not what I want. Should I wait until this group is better known and brings in a more professional person to direct their future output?"
5,simply supurb,"I think this group is absolutely stunning. I have all that they have put out except ""the promise"" and hopefully it will be a Christmas gift. I really like their 2 DVDs and wish they would do up another one. This group is gifted and well worth watching and buying."
5,WISH THEY WOULD MAKE MORE!,I'VE BECOME ADDICTED TO IL DIVO AND THIS VIDEO MADE ME WISH ALL THEIR CD WERE DVD ALSO!
4,EXCELLENT...VERY WELL DONE!,The DVD is very well done. Classy. Devoted fans and newcomers will enjoy the performances as well as the interviews with the guys.Enjoy!
5,Beautiful voices.,"These four young, handsome men make beautiful music. A prize for any library of music. You don't have to be an opera or classical nut to enjoy this DVD."
2,this dvd is a crap!,"I am a big fan of il divo and bought all their cds and dvds so far. I really liked their second album 'ancora'. but this concert dvd is a total crap. all the songs were lip-synced and not live. i liked their first live album much better, which was real live concert. also, why don't they sing the entire songs of their album but only 5 or 6? it was good that i could hear of their stories through the interview and stuff, but what people want to get by purchasing their live album is to listen to their live music! i should say this dvd is a total crap even though i'm a real big fan of il divo."
5,"the language of love, four tenors","The youthful audience and musicians here give hope for the future of music. The success of Il Divo is proof that the young still have a place in their hearts for beauty in their lives. This video allows viewers to become acquainted with each singer and with the uniqueness of each voice. Altogether, they create a sound that is THRILLING. The international nature of the group brings together artists and audience on both sides of the Atlantic.They are irresistable!"
1,Not worth the money,"Would you pay $15 for a CD that only had 6 songs on it? The why would you pay that for a DVD. I expected to see a full 2 hour concert of some sort. What I got was 6 songs and then a DVD talking about the origins of the group. The only people I could see buying this are those interested in the groups history or women who want to go gaga over Il Divo and will pay to see them no matter what. If you like the music, buy the CD. As far as production value, if seeing 5 guys on stage singing songs you already know is your idea of a good time, go for it."
1,Beware of DVD Format,I was not able to play this DVD even though the formatting was supposed to work in the US and Canada. I am now afraid to buy any Il Divo DVD's from the internet because it may not work.
5,Outstanding Listening,Very pleased to have this in my collection - they are the perfect blend of voices and enjoyable to listen to. I would recommend this to anyone.
4,Added info. rated,"I like the added feature of the interview with the four men. They speak about their backgrounds and also of getting the group going. However, I can always do without Simon Cowell even though he is showing restaint. The three classically trained singers obviously know more than he. Also, I wish Carlos would hold back his need to show off his big barritone voice. It does not always blend. It seems, at times, he is trying to out do David, who also has a big voice. Personally, I prefer Urs' lyric tenor voice as it is the purest of the four. If he made an album on his own I'd be the first to buy it."
5,Good unit for the money,"I purchased this GPS for $400 last November. Overall, I'm happy with it, it is very easy to use and it has been accurate. I don't need a fancy GPS, this one is economical and gets the job done for me. The screen is big and bright, I have it mounted on my SUVs windshield using the provided suction holder, and I have no problem reading the display from my driving position. It is a good unit for the money."
1,The worst GPS I've seen,"The FineDrive 400 is a complete letdown. I've never seen any GPS system remotely as bad and unuseable as this piece of junk. The screen is dark and invisible in daylight, and the software is buggy and slow. Initial satellite search took more than 5 minutes, whereas my Microsoft GPS took less than 30 seconds. And the Finedrive kept losing the signal even with full view of the sky. This is a very bad system. Support is also non-existent; their website wasn't working every time I checked. Do not waste your money. It's not worth a single penny."
3,You get what you pay for...,"I'm sending mine back. Overall a good value, however there were too many errors in the maps, too many POI's not listed. Not only did it not find the restaurant I took my family to dinner at tonight... it didn't even find the road which has been there for 10 years. Touch screen buttons are way too small making typing an address very frustrating. I'd rather pony up the extra moolah and get a unit that will not frustrate me.See you on the road."
1,DANGER!!! NO CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!,I bought two of these... one broke down... can't turn it on...I tried calling the customer service... emailed... etc... but NO ANSWER!!!I just tried again... but their voicemail box is FULL!!!JUST REMEMBER! NO CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!
3,Device has great features but some of them do not work,"The device has wonderful features for a very reasonable price, it has MP3 player with FM transmitter to listen to the music through the vehicle's audio system and the navigation system is very accurate and gives clear turn by turn directions.The problem that the device stopped working after one week. Amazon where very nice and professional and I returned the defective machine and received within three days another unit.I used the second unit in the beginning just for navigation, when I wanted to used the MP3 player I was surprised that the FM transmitter is not working and had to send it back. I think the manufacturer does not have a quality control system to make sure that all units are working before they are shipped.On the other hand, the after sale service is very poor and you can not talk to any one on the tech support phone number and if it happen and get some one, they are absolutely helpless"
2,BEWARE!! NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT!!!,"I received this unit as a Christmas gift and used it almost daily. I like its features and ease of use. Then the problems started. Power cord won't make a good connection. Software crashes. Now it doesn't know where it is anymore because the unit is not acquiring the satellites. I have tried to contact their support by phone, e-mail and fax. No answer. I have a sinking feeling that it's going to become an expensive paperweight. Maybe I'll put it on my Rand McNally so the pages don't blow around. ;-)UPDATE July 2007: Fine Digital has not responded to the local Better Business Bureau nor the California Department of Consumer Affairs. Beware!"
4,Has been very relieable!!,"Now having used the system for a little over 2 months, overall I am very pleased with the accuracy. It has had a few flaws. On our way through the mountains on an Interstate, it told me to make a left turn in 2000 feet! (Into a mountain)? Thank God, it was a trial run and I actually knew where I was going. I did alot of research before purchasing and truly based my final decision on particular reviews. One in particular had good reviews and stated, ""just because it's a name your not familiar with, doesn't mean it's not a good reliable unit"". I have recommended and others have purchased the same unit. Happy Trails!!!!"
1,"""Fine"" would not be the word I'd use for it.","I checked out one of these units in the store.First, it is completely cheesy looking and feeling. Totally cheap. All the fit and finish of an Etch-a-sketch, which it closely resembles.Second, as another reviewer noted, the touch-screen buttons are very difficult to utilize due to their size.The whole thing just feels slapped together with little thought. Compared to the Garmin's or even the TomToms and Magellans, this thing is not something I'd spend money on."
2,Great Product but pray it does not break,"This product works great and awesome features for the price. I got one in Sept06 and since last 6 weeks its losing track (satellite trcking), speker blew up, keeps losing power. To top it all there is absolutely no customer service. No one returns voicemails (I left no. of them), nor do they respond to emails. Seems like its my money down the drain."
1,Before buying just try to call their customer service,"I have got few problems with this device,-the most annoying,- sometimes it stops to provide voice guidance, It guides you alright giving few voice directions and then - silence, so you need to watch the screen all the time. It is always late by a distance of ~50-150ft (depending on your speed) so you will need to correct mentally your position, can be confusing when two intersections are close by. In few months, after I bought my device the speaker broke dawn, still speaks but with a lot of distortions. All my attempts to contact customer service (phone, e-mail) have failed. The phone # is 866-346-3344, there is always the same message ""the mail box is full and not accepting new messages"""
3,FINE DRIVE 400,The system claims to cover Canada and the US but it didn't cover some major citys in Maine and the main city in Nova Scotia. The unit also died on my first trip with it. I was lucky the sellar replaced it after I was told they only guarantied it for 15 days. I thank them for replacing the unit.
2,this is not a gps,"this item is so hard to use 9 times ouf 10 it wont find an address,everything else works great, the screen its nice and lit both during night and day. so if you want to see in what direction you are goingbuy this gps"
3,good book,"I enjoyed looking at the pictures. I wish I could read better, I would probably enjoy more."
4,Consistency=good songs+production.,"Willy Porter is best experienced at one of his live performances but, as far as studio recordings go, this a beauty!! I have all of his CD releases to date, and it appears to be a cohesive ""band"" vibe happening here, just by the sound and production quality alone. But, don't be mistaken, the songs are as usual, first-class!! Bravo, Willy. See ya on stage."
4,"good album, not Willy's best","I'm a big fan of Willy's, but this is not my favorite album. I previously liked live performances of Available Light and Loose Gravel better, before they evolved into their album form. And I reach for fast forward every time Me & My Old Man comes on.That being said, Willy is an amazing artist, and this is a necessary purchase for fans. He's just so good, and most of this album is quite enjoyable. But if you're looking to buy your first album, I would probably start with the self-titled record or High Wire Live."
3,It was okay,"Think Oliver Twist. It was good for a one time watch but we bought it and my kids would rather watch Harry Potter or really any of their other movies that are more compelling. Like I said this was good but you don't catch anything new, or laugh at a favorite joke with subsequent viewings."
2,An insipid interpretation of a great book...,"I admit to holding high expectations of this film based on the wonderful writings by author Cornelia Funke. Unfortunatly, this is simply a case where the book transcends the movie. I found that Funke's literary sense is barely recognizable in this film. The screenplay, or directing, lacks focus and ambles its way through Funke's delightful story. I credit the actors for their decent performances, and the setting in modern-day Venice is especially beautiful. Still, the entire film appeares flat compared to Funke's rich and visual text. My hope is that Inkheart, Funke's next book-turned-movie, captures the magic and mastery of her prose. If so, it's a must-see for anyone who really wants to see a book come to life."
3,ADVENTURE IN VENICE,"Since a lot of movies aren't set in the lush Venice landscape, THE THIEF LORD is commended for its use of the canals and gorgeous buildings. The story based on a popular children's books is somewhat like OLIVER with a 16 year old Fagin.Two orphaned brothers escape the grasping clutches of their nasty relatives and head for Venice, where they are taken in by a gang of young thieves, headed by the charismatic Thief Lord, Scippio. Meanwhile a private eye has been hired to find the boys, and the quest for a mysterious wing lures the boys into a lucrative theft.It's all far-fetched but engaging, and the young cast tries hard. The warmth and love between the two brothers is refreshing and the adults are game, including a cameo by Vanessa Redgrave."
4,Good Movie for kids,"My daughter had already read the book and wanted the movie, she likes it very much. For those who have already read the book (like me, and liked it) I felt that the movie moved too fast, didn't follow the book closely enough, and the magical merry go round wasn't nearly as cool as I had pictured in my mind while reading the book."
3,Wonderful Movie,"""The Thief Lord"" movie was very close to it's book counterpart by Cornelia Funke. The actors protrayed their characters beautifully and I enjoyed this movie throughly."
2,Attractive Actors/Poor Plot Line,"I bought this DVD based on the good reviews written here. And I have to admit the actors looked good and the movie had a nice look. But I and my family were disappointed by the shallow, disjointed storytelling involved. A good movie should also be true in how it presents a story so that consequences follow on actions. But here, everything works out fine in spite of characters doing them the wrong way. If nothing else, Scipio should have aged 20-30 years at least for riding the Merry-Go-Round rather than just a few years and all his problems being solved. My advice is to buy Disney's ""Something Wicked This Way Comes"" or ""Oliver"". Either is a much better movie for children and families."
3,Not So Good As The 1st CD!,"Although I like Soft Cells version of God Shaped Hole, I wasn't impressed a lot by the live version of Say Hello, Wave Goodbye. It was the worst version I heard! The dub mix of The Night is good, but it needs repeated listenings. I like the Almighty Mix on the 1st disc. Get that one also!"
4,Light Tull,"Interesting ""almost Unplugged"" Tull record. It contains alternate arrangements of old Tull favorites and less known numbers (some of them instrumental only.) However the ""reggae"" version of ""Too Old to Rock and Roll, Too Young To Die"" does not sound reggae to me and is inferior to the original. This record is, sometimes, a little bit too ""light."""
3,So So,Mediocre later Tull release. Be sure you have all the early catalogue before judging the band by the strength of this one
3,Not my favorite live Tull,"In my opinion, this is easily the weakest of all the live Tull releases. The first track(off the first Tull album) starts it off well,but it just seems to sound weedier and increasingly unimpressive from there on. I'm not much of a fan of acoustic versions of electric material to begin with,and the complete absence of ""Aqualung"" material except for ""Locomotive Breath"" didn't help either. For diehard Tull fans only."
4,intimate Tull,"Captures Tull in small intimate venues in Turkey, Greece, Israel, etc. A tight band, with Pegg and Mattacks on bass and drums respectively.Hooked me right away . . . worth it just for ""Nursie.""Pseudo-unplugged. The most underrated Tull album."
5,Born Again Tullian,"I was a major Jethro Tull fan from 1968 until about 1976, saw him many times in concert but got sidetracked by Springsteen for 10 years. I recently saw Ian Anderson doing the orchestral concert and I'm back for good! Based on everyone's recommendations, I bought this CD and couldn't agree more. Ian Anderson is a true artist, making each song interesting, even ones he's surely played thousands of times, like ""Bouree"" and ""Locomotive Breath"". Now, after 30 years, I appreciate the originality and complexity of his music and admire Anderson/Jethro Tull even more."
1,missing,where is Josko Grauner in this book ? Why people from other country should not know one of the most famous Italian winemaker ? for political reason ?
3,Dull but readable,"This is sturdy, workmanlike English middlebrow reading fodder. A triangle between a Widmerpool-like grasping solicitor who overeats and hoards expensive antiques, his lower-middle-class bride, and a boxer from the gutter. The characters are pretty stereotypical and never do anything unexpected. Robert Alter has suggested that the mark of supreme artistry in fiction is that the characters can surprise consistently. One of the more interesting facets is the Angell's (the solicitor's) eating disorder, which is pretty nicely detailed. In the background is the social topsy-turveydom of Swining London in the late 1960's, but this promising theme is not really developed."
4,Fine addition to my jazz collection,"""Why Was I Born?"" - a great example of electric guitar meets saxophone. Great stuff."
1,Make money with horses: You can do it,"This book has some great ideas, with alot of percentages for examples, but it is primarily for the individual that wishes to go into the horse racing business. Theres not too much info for the person that wants to make money having a riding facility, or giving trail rides. Basically its for someone that wants to make a quick profit buying horses and fastly turning around and selling them. I would not recommed this book for the person wishing to start a nice casual back yard business."
4,Make Money With Horses,"I purchased this book in 2001 when I was starting out in the Thoroughbred Horse Racing business. It is now April 2, 2006 and I still quote this book. So much so that my trainer is purchasing 5 copies for his other owners. It is really good for people who are just getting into the business; do not have a lot of money or having problems making a profit. So far I have not loss a dime on any horse I have owned. I often refer to it as my ""Racing Bible"". Need I say more?"
3,Outdated,"Although small and concise, the book uses outdated terms and information. I have to be very careful when using for reference in my classroom."
4,lightweight and packs very small,This is a great jacket for cycling since it packs extremely small and is very lightweight. It is good for those days when you might need that extra layer. The bright colors make it very visible for road cycling. A disadvantage is that it is extremely loud when going over 30mph from the lightweight fabric snapping right next to your ears. The jacket is form fitting but for me is cut an inch or two too short in the front.
3,for my niece....so I didn't really use it,"I keep getting reminders to review this product, but it is for a Christmas gift for my niece in another state...I have no idea about it honestly...especially since it was shipped directly there and will not be opened for another week yet!"
1,One Time Use Toy,This was a Christmas present my two girls (8 and 5) received. It was basically a one time use toy. The paint clogged up the turning mechanism and stopped working.....while it was spinning. It was a complete waste of money and just added trash to the landfill.
4,"Great fun, black paper is awful","This is a great Spin Art. My 3 year old likes it and is fully capable of using it with supervision. Not sure why the rating is 6 and up. If you liked Spin Art as a kid this will bring back great memories. The colors this model comes with are fluorescent. While it comes with a good amount of paint the paper amount was a little on the light side. Plus, the black paper it comes with looks really great with the colors while wet. When it dries that colors fade and the painting look awful. I suggest sticking with the white paper.If this came with more paper and the black worked better it would easily be 5 stars, but I have to drop it a star because of those problems.The unit is very light weight and compact.Any kid will like it."
4,"Good, fun toy","My daughter received this as a gift for her 5th birthday. She was SO excited to try it out. After playing with it for awhile, I have to say it's definitely a hit. The ""splash guard"" is very flimsy. While it works, I do wish it were more heavy weight plastic. I'm not sure what we will do if it rips or tears. There is clean up involved, but I didn't find it to be more time consuming than any other painting craft. It does come with a warning that the paint stains so we just threw on our paint shirts and had fun! I'm sure the paint and paper will run out soon, but when it does I plan to cut cardstock as another reviewer suggested. I may even try some regular washable kids paint in the original paint bottles to see how that works.Overall a good, fun toy for kids (and adults too)."
3,A disappointed grandson,This is a very clever product and captivated my 7 year old grandson HOWEVER the paint and card stock provided were very stingy in quantity. The fascination lasted less than one day since the paint was nearly depleted and the paper was used up. For $30 bucks (including shipping) the manufacturer could have afforded to be more generous with supplies.
3,Spin Art a great toy,"I bought this for my grandson's fifth birthday. I remembered having one as a kid and also doing this at the county fairs. It was very popular because it took no talent at all! My grandson (AND my son) love it. Make sure you also get the batteries for it if it is a gift so they play right away. Nice, simple, fun toy."
1,Do not waste your money!!,"The plastic ""shield"" is so flimsy I almost threw it away thinking it was part of the wrapping. After making two pictures the product no longer spun because of the paint build up. There is no way to take the item apart to clean. The white paper they send you to use with it. Does not work, it just folds up. A waste of money."
4,Fun Toy To Pull Out Occasionally,"This is a simple toy: it spins a piece of paper while you drop paint on it, making cool patterns. This was one of the first presents my 6 year old girl and 2 year old boy started playing with on Christmas. Be aware that the ""splash shield"" might appear to be cheap plastic packaging material. We had to dig it back out of the trash. It ended up not being necessary because the paint did not splatter without it.The toy takes one C battery. It comes with both black and white paper, which was mostly used up on Christmas morning. It comes with 5 paint tubes and two vials of glitter. While the paint looks great on the black paper when first applied, it practically disappears after it dries. Maybe it should be obvious, but wait until the paper stops spinning to put the glitter on. The only real difficulty my kids had in using it was squeezing out too much paint on the paper, leaving big globs. It does not feel that durable, but it does the job."
2,Save your money-Would be great if it actually lasted!,"Ordered this toy for Christmas from an amazon seller (yoyo.com) and it came on time as expected. On Christmas morning we opened it, put a battery in it and nothing. It didn't spin. The seller sent a new one no questions asked and it again arrived quickly and the return was hassle free. The new one worked for about 20 minutes in total before it just stopped spinning. I was there supervising my kids and it wasn't due to any mishandling. During that time my kids loved it but certainly not worth the money paid. I called the seller and they were great and refunded my money. I know that there can be an occasional defective product but two in a row? Save your money!!"
2,This is not the one I expected,This Binocular is very small in real than it looks in the picture. I can not see objects clearly from half a mile also. I am not using this at all.
5,Hillbilly songs!,"Found this (rare!) CD after a lot of years! An easy transaction too! After becoming disillusioned with ebay, I'm going on Amazon much more often now for my needs and have always been happy! Jim"
4,divine!,i love this stuff so much that i just ordered four more bottles to give away for christmas. the sugar scrubs you and dissolves and creates a supple moisture barrier that is not greasy. and it smells great w/out being too floral or too strong. i love it and it's not even expensive. edit: i just got 4 bottles of thsi for christmas gifts and every bottle was clogged and the sugar was settled and the scrub couldn't be squeezed out. with mine i had to cut it open and put the scrub in a jar. the product is still fantastic but too bad the packaging is poor.
4,Sobran on the warpath (alleluia),America's funniest political pundit dissects America's funniest president (whom Sobran rightly likens to Falstaff): so how can you possibly go wrong with this collection of spirited and fierce essays? The author's combination of moral passion with complete freedom from unctuousness remains as impressive as ever.
3,great writer discusses trivial things,"Joe Sobran is one of the best, if not the best, columnists in America. I enjoy reading his columns weekly. That said, this book is not all that great. The Lewinsky ""scandal"" (I use quotes because I consider the whole matter extremely trivial) was just not worthy of so many columns. In fact, the best columns in the book were the few where he discusses foreign policy or some other subject.Even Sobran's cleverness can't change the fact that Lewinskygate was much ado over nothing. If you'e going to buy a book from him, get Alias Shakespeare or Single Issues. Those were both terrific."
3,Good buy,I paid $211 for this product (incl shipping). For that money it was well worth it. Could be a bit louder. The HDMI pass through is real convenient. I had trouble getting it to work and called Sony. I think they were open until 10PM EST and they help me out in no time.Would recommend this.
4,Great sound for a great price,"Bought this for my apartment, and was impressed with the quality. Received has plenty of connections available, including two HDMI devices (although you have to run a separate audio cable such as fiber optic or coax in order to get sound from the home theater when using HDMI). Everything went together smoothly, and the auto-calibration feature with the included mic made the system sound great. Robust bass, clear highs. Definitely worth every penny and more. Only downside is that the cables included for the speakers tend to run a bit short, but they aren't pre-attached, so you can just buy your own speaker wire and be all set."
2,sub par,"if your not picky , these will still sound bad, i don't recommend this set, the receiver is fine but the speakers just don't cut it, you will find yourself replacing them."
1,miserable experience with Sony,"The receiver did not work out of the box-- no signal at all. Rather than send the large and bulky package, with all the speakers, back to Amazon, I sent the receiver to the Sony Center in Laredo texas. It took forever to get an acknowledgement, until I went on line and saw they wanted to charge me nearly $80 for cosmetic repairs to the front of the receiver-- and were waiting for my OK, without ever emailing me that there was an issue. The receiver, needless to say, had been very well packed and protected. Eventually, they sent it back without charge-- but when I went to plug it in, and pushed the on/off button, the button went all the way through and fell somewhere into the bowels of the unit. After an email exchange with the Sony people in Laredo, with no reply after the first one, I just gave up. I will eat the cost and look elsewhere. Sony products are very good, but beware if there is ever a repair problem-- they are wholly incompetent."
2,This system sucks,I selected this system over others primarily for the HDMI ports so that I do not have to use multiple cables for video and audio but discovered that the y are only pass-through for video. I invested in a DVD player with HDMI port and changed my cable box for one that has HDMI. All are connected to the system using the HDMI ports with an optical cable from the cable box for sound. The volume on the system is maxed out but the sound from the speakers are low when using either DVD or TV. It is not worth the trouble and cost to return it.
4,Fine album,"Fine, very solid album in a ""classic pop""/lounge style. Stahl'scareful & warm voice like an updated Doris Day in a small groupsetting. Some intriguing arrangements too-- check out ""Deep Purple,""or ""Sugar."" And some intriguing song choices as well-- ""Baby Love"" & ""Where the Boys Are"" for example. She can handle upbeat songs & heartfelt ballads equally well. A welcome addition to the ranks of newer standards singers."
4,Lots of Symbols,"A lot of symbols for the price, a lot easier than drawing them yourself.Take Note they are not compatible with AutoSketch 9, even though Amazon will sell them together as a package, they do not work together. Check it out at the AutoDesk web site."
5,Beginner Gardener,"As a beginner, gardening can be difficult but this book is a big help. Fruit, veggies, perennials, annuals, herb, roses, bulbs, etc. with tons of color pictures. My step-mother and sister-in-law would love to have this book and I paid the list $ at a popular book store here in town. Amazon: great price!!"
2,new is not better,Upon ordering this item I found several items either missing or lacking. The original had much more information on a broader narative. I a dissapointed with my purchace and of readers digest. There is a readon the previous editions were raved over.I found the deletion of the house plant section and the deletion of several over views of plant propegation of several species and varieties in addition to gardening in small spaces and green house gardening dissapointing.Better luck next timeMeike Young
5,Info by the truckload,"Great book for vegetables, trees, bushes, flowers, etc. The sections on diseases and pests were extremely beneficial in detecting what was going wrong in my yard. My only complaint was that some of the pictures were in black and white and I prefer color."
2,Came Broken,"The product itself is really nice and looks great! We had previously ordered one for my father in law and it looked so good that we decided to get one for ourselves.Ours came with a broken handle, chipped corners and an overall rundown look. We weren't able to return it as we never got around to it! We fixed it up ourselves."
1,Don't buy,I bought two and put wine in the first one. I picked it up and the flimsy handle snapped right off. Poorly made.
4,Great Gift for Hubby,"I bought this for my husband who is always working in his vehicle. He loves it. The fit was great for his Tahoe, it holds his laptop securely and he loves the feature that allows him to slide his laptop forward when he needs it and out of the way when he doesn't.The section that holds file folders is perfect for documents he needs to access often, and the storage space beneath the desk top is sufficient for his other materials.I would have like to see the slot for the seatbelt cut a little deeper, but the desk is pretty secure."
5,Awesome,This CD took me back in time. Every track is amazing and transports you to another time and place. Of course my favorite track is love changes everything.
5,Wonderful fun DVD for Spanish beginner,I just received the DVD and cannot believe how fun it can be to learn a new language. There are several sections and each one is followed by a quiz. It makes learning easy and manageble. I strongly recommend this DVD to beginners.
2,This may not work in your DVD player...,I have a one year old Zenith 5 disc DVD player and it doesn't work for me.
1,Same Program Different Titles,"Normally I would have given a 5 star rating BUT I first bought Advanced Spanish - Beyond the Basics. I liked it so much I bought Advanced Spanish - Verbs, Spanish 1&2 and ¿Habla Español?. My tape of Advanced Spanish - Verbs is IDENTICAL to Advanced Spanish - Beyong the Basics. In fact it had that as the title for the video when you view the tape. The DVD of ¿Habla Español? is IDENTICAL to the Spanish 1 tape except for some quizzes. I wrote the company with this complaint and got no answer. If you go to their site you will find about 20 Advanced Spanish DVDs that have descriptions that all appear to be the same DVD with different titles. I would definitely not buy Spanish 1. Instead buy the ¿Habla Español? DVD. If you already have Spanish 1, you won't get much from this DVD. Other than this, I would be very careful buying from this company."
3,Double check the exact title your buying.,"I own 3 of these DVD's from this place. The titles can appear similar so be sure you are buying what you wanted. I bought this one only to discover that either they mailed me the wrong one, or else I just unluckily ended up with a beginners dvd. (""Basics vs Beyond the Basics vs Learning the Basics"", etc) This one with the picture of the formal dressed man and woman dancing on the dvd cover, is strictly a beginners lesson. It starts with teaching you the numbers 1 thur 10, etc. Overall, this line of dvd's are good videos and they alone have gotten me past my 10 year learing barriers and allowed me to break through the world of pronouns, refexive, etc, and also break into the world of subjective verbs which have been my 10 year learning nemisis to improving my spanish. Yes, these vid's appear to be goofy and sesame street like, but this teaching approach has not been a deterent to the valuable lessons they provide."
1,Too wild and inappropriate for younger viewers.,"The content included in this DVD is not appropriate for young learners. It was recommended for Middle/High school but its use of certain language, ""alcohol"" and ""crazy"" depictions are really inappropriate."
4,Great for beginners!!,"I had my doubts about this dvd, but once I started the lessons, it was hard to stop. Very detailed vocabulary and grammar lessons that are easy to follow. This dvd is for someone who doesn't know a word of Spanish because it really gets down to the basics, but it is never boring. It also includes reviews and short exams which will help you know what you need to back over and review. You will also find a little humour in the lessons which is nice. You will learn a lot in a short time. Note: Have a notebook and pen handy - you will want to pause the lessons from time to time and take notes."
3,Not Doyle's Best Work,"As a rule, I tend to like everything I've ever read of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's writings. I'm a huge fan of Sherlock Holmes, but a lot of what Doyle wrote was superior to the Sherlock stories. Beyond the City was okay - I did like it, but it wasn't one of his better pieces."
5,helps ace commecial knowledge exam!,Went through this book answering every question in about 5 days. Very simple and easy to use. Took the exam right after I was finished and got a 97.
3,Not bad but far from excellent,"This book is certainly informative but it has distinctive liberal slant and because of that I'm not giving it high marks. If you want unbiased account of Middle East history and especially current events read ""Idiot's Guide to Middle East conflict""."
5,Better than Expected Movie!!,"Fun, engaging, movie with good acting by all cast members. Nice special effects and good storyline. The length of the movie was perfect... Not too long nor too short.This movie isn't just geared for kids either, but also great for adults too. I am glad that both adults and kids may enjoy watching this film."
5,Movies that make you go YES!,"This was a great movie. Awesome story, awesome acting, great special effects and who doesn't love a superhero?! This looked great on blu-ray. I did have a small issue with the movie slowing down on my ps3 but I think i've determined that its a hardware problem on my end, not any fault of the disc itself. I would still reccommend this even with my tiny slowing down problem."
4,Lots of cool gadgets!,"The whole family enjoyed this movie with it's futuristic gadgets and the adventure. Not too violent for my taste, and that's sometimes hard to find!"
4,Ironman,"My grandson loves this movie, I received it 3 days after I ordered it which was great! We are very happy with the fast service"
4,"A Good Buy ... for those who wants to know the format, rather than the movie itself","If you are wondering if it is a good buy for this Blu-ray format disc, buy!A really good buy, beautiful colors, superb pictures and sound quality. Not bad story line."
1,Iron Man: Metrosexual Man Bimbo,"This movie is perhaps the worst atrocity foisted upon the unsuspecting public by brain-dead and/or corrupt movie critics. How else to explain it's 93% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes? Packed with airheaded one liners masquerading as meaningful dialogue, and one dimensional characters so narcissistically unlikable a Wal-Mart greeter wouldn't even acknowledge their presence, this clunker somehow goes through all the motions of a summertime action movie without being the least bit entertaining. Oh and it has a deep moral message too: making weapons for a living is evil, because someday bad guys might use them!"
1,"Movie good, service bad","The movie is great, but the customer service was not. It all started when the price changed durning check out from $15 to $27. The customer service rep was not willing to do anything and stated that i was lying."
5,GREAT Movie !,"This superhero movie has it all...action, humor, romance, and more.The two disc set is interesting, but I see why they deleted the extra scenes."
5,Marvel Delivers a Winner This Time!!!,"When the Comic inspired movies have been hit or miss lately, Iron Man is a BIG hit. After Daredevil,(awful) The Hulk bomb, Fantastic Four...eh, at least we got to see Jessica Alba, and even the last Spiderman came up really short, this was a very welcome surprise. Robert Downey Jr. is excellent, as is Jeff Bridges, and Gwyneth Paltrow. The story is very well executed. (Having never read Iron Man in my days of youth, I didn't have to waste 2 hours making sure the screenplay was exactly like the old comic.) I imagine the film could have been longer in order to add more dimension and back story, but this delivered the goods, and I look forward to the sequel. 5 stars!"
5,SWEEEEET movie and looks great in HD,This is my first Blu Ray disc. I bought it to test out myBlu-ray Player. I wanted a modern movie that i saw no more than once and which i could tolerate watching over and over. This was my choice. It has really good graphics and action intensive. I loved it.
5,Great movie... and even more incredible on Blu-ray,"This was an excellent movie... probably one of Robert Downy Jr.'s best. Unlike most Blu-ray movies that are older that have been converted to blu-ray, this one (being so new) was meant for Blu-ray. It is truly incredible in HD. The colors are so vibrant and you can see ever little detail on our 52"" Sony Bravia. This is worth every penny!"
4,JUST WAIT A WHILE AND THE DISC WILL LOAD ... EVENTUALLY,we had to wait 10 minutes for the disc to load on our PS3.it is on now!don't go back! or you have to wait againenjoy!
5,Great,"I probably wouldn't of liked it without Robert Downey jr. He's perfect for this role, played tony stark perfectly. My 2nd best marvel movie after avengers."
3,Entertaining!,"Good action superhero movie, very slick and very hollywood. Decent overall but no particular stand-out points here."
4,No quibbles with the movie; but the transfer team should have done better,"I just want to make it clear that I love the movie. I have a few quibbles with the script, but nothing that serious. {Like how did Obie manage to control that giant power suit so well when he had no time to practice his Ironman Kung-Fu?}My real quibble is with the Blu-ray transfer team. They did not implement DTS-HD Master Audio, which is the top-flight audio standard Blu-Ray offers. They should have used DTS-HD MA. Also, there is some softness and grainy noise in the picture occasionally. I found this very surprising. Certainly, a movie just released this summer cannot have had time to degrade on a media shelf somewhere in North Hollywood. Certainly, such a recent master must have had many purely digital elements. Certainly, they should have been able to avoid some of the problems associated with film transfer?I am afraid Paramount is still figuring out Blu-Ray after having been entrenched in the HD-DVD camp."
3,BEWARE,"For those of us with slightly older Bluray players, this one just sits there and loads forever. Did manage to see the Parmaount logo on one of the discs. Just did a full firmware upgrade a week ago. Disk will still not play. Oddly, other new Paramount Discs like Godfather played fine. Just a word of warning to those who had the Batman Begins problem this past year - It's the same old same old. These companies do the best the can to screw the consumer. It's really criminal."
2,PS3 Issues,"I wasn't able to play it until I looked up ""Iron Man blue-ray issues"" on the internet. I had to turn the internet connection off on my PS3 to get it to play. The movie was excellent but the 30 min of trying to figure out what the problem was rates it a 2!!"
2,Item never recieved,"After waiting about a month for my order, I received e-mail from Amazon saying I would receive refund. My other orders through different sellers were delivered in about a week. I'm sure there's a great explanation for why I never got it but hey, you make the call."
2,Iron Man Review,"Good special effects, Downey is excellent, Bridges was mis-cast and took away from the movie for me. Movie just didn't give me the feelings I need."
1,Love and hate,I loved iron man so much that I got it in digital format. Little did I know I couldn't use it the way I wanted too. I had to us there service download extra apps and I couldn't save it on iTunes. I could only watch it whenever I had Internet. Witch means it eats up my data package. Costing me money to stream when I shouldn't have to.
2,Great movie but the DVD is bad on a PC,"Seen this show twice at the movies and bought the DVD today, picture is awesome but the sound sucks! The special effects are loud and clear but the dialog is so low I can hardly hear what they are saying over the special effect sounds. Tried it on my desktop (which has never had any problems playing dvd's) and my laptop, both have the same problems.. Not sure if I just got a bad DVD or not, going back to the store to exchange it for another."
2,Not impressed,I looked forward to this movie..but disappointment reigned big time...I really like Robert Downey Jr..but I was not impressed ..
5,Iron Man Blu-ray REVIEW,I purchased Iron Man on Blu-ray and it arrived in 7 business days. Way cool. Arrived in excellent condition and was very well packaged.
5,Great Movie,Great Movie. I am a fan of Marvel Comics and this is just another enjoyable movie within the franchise. Cant wait to see what else comes.
5,Very Entertaining Movie,"Very much enjoyed this movie. Didn't get a chance to see it in the movies, but had friends over for the viewing and they commented how much it was like being at the movies. I have HD and Surround which brought the movie to life."
3,Just OK,"Robert Downey, Jr. does about as good a job with the lead character as anyone could, and the acting is pretty good overall, but the special effects are just OK, the plot is somewhat juvenille, and the portrayal of the Afghan bad guys is laughably stereotypical. I watched this movie with the family (not my choice of movie), and it wasn't a total waste of time, but I do wish the time had been better spent."
5,fabislei7,"Just when I needed a hero... here came one. Nice. You better not quit here. This was too good not to do I2, I3, I4 etc. If Harry Potter can do it, you can do it better! You are my kind of guy! Do it again!"
5,Great!!,"Iron Man has always been the Marvel Character that I enjoy watching. The guy is a genius who knows his way around the ladies, I mean, technology, who wouldn't like him? Anyways, the movie was great, could have used a little bit of extras, but other than that, I'll probably be watching this over and over again."
5,One of the best,"Easily the best movie based on a Marvel character. Not only does it take the idea of a superhero into new territory, but it also manages to throw in everything lovable about the new found genre. Most of this movie's heart and charm is owed to Robert Downey Jr., who completely ownes the character in every way possible. The reason Iron Man has become a household name so suddenly is because it was acted so well and made as realistic as possible. It also takes the best parts of the source material and makes it into something familiar, but also new (much like Batman Begins). John Favreau managed to get down the comedy without making the movie become one. When this wants to be, it is a fantastic action movie with lots of great explosions and special effects. However, this also knows how to invest time in its characters and plot so we care about what will happen. The attention to detail is incredible."
5,Love this movie!,Was happy to purchase because I saw it in the movies and loved it. Can't wait for the next one to come out.
5,Entertaining Movie for All Ages,"Iron Man is an excellent movie for anyone, regardless of age. Children can enjoy it because it's understandable to the younger views (and not too violent). Adults can enjoy it be it's fun, witty and entertaining.Robert Downey Jr. plays the role of Tony Stark to a T. I don't think they could have gotten a better actor to play this character. The story was well written and leaves plenty of room for sequels.The blu-ray version is very sharp, crisp and has some pretty nice special features."
5,Es una obra maestra,La presentacion de dos discos con dolby digital sourrond 5.1 y la presentacion de la caja muy original .-.-.-.-..-EXCELENTE
5,Iron Man is a great movie! Buy the DVD!,"Iron Man is a great movie! Buy the DVD! Robert Downey Jr. plays Tony Stark. Terrance Howard Plays Jim Rhodes. Jeff Bridges plays the Iron Man's nemesis, Iron Monger. Gwyneth Paltrow plays Tony Stark's assistant, Pepper Potts. There is a cameo by Marvel Comics writer/creator Stan Lee. The Iron Man movie is great and is fun to watch! A"
3,No outer cover sleeve,"I was sort of expecting the DVD's advertised cover sleeve to come along with it, but didn't recieve it. The DVD case had a lot of scratches but the disc was fine."
4,Fun and Action Packed,"Watched with the kids on NYE and we all thoroughly enjoyed it. Pretty good story, a lot of good action, and great cars."
5,"Not a Comic Fan, BUT Loved the Movie","I honestly never saw or read anything about Ironman before this movie. On the other hand, my hubby has been a comic fan for many years. We both loved this movie. Robert Downey Jr puts in a cheeky performance as Tony Stark; great story, great cast, and the production, cinematography, music score, etc. are all superb."
2,Taking out the trash.,"Iron Man is the biggest disappoinment so far this year. I was so bored and confused by this train wreck, I lost interest after 45 minutes of nothing. Robert Downey Jr. is horrible, he brings nothing exciting as Iron Man, highly over-rated actor. I give this film two stars thanks to Gwyneth Paltrow and Terrence Howard, wish they were in it more, they are the real deal. This is one action film I won't be seeing twice, yuck!"
1,Burnt Blu Ray,Now that I have begun collecting blu ray I can realize if it is a fake or not and the Iron Man copy is a duplicate. thanks to Sony Database the information automatically generates when you play plus I noticed it stated BR - D not BR-Rom and there was no menu options. If I was going to buy a bootlegg I would have played a lot less but blu ray has so many heatures like online and hope no one buys anything from them because there misleading.
3,took way to long,the product is self was great but it took way to long i ordered it it was suppose to take 3 to 5 days but it took 2 1-2 weeks
5,Great Movie!,My 5 year old is addicted to the Iron Man movies and we ordered this BD for him. There is adult commentary that he doesn't understand but makes it more interesting for mom and dad. Great picture quality as well.
1,no refund on junk!!!!!,"great movie but you can't watch it unless you own a kindle fire!i cant use it for anything not my Ipod, or the crapy ultraviolet. ultraviolet sucks too its streaming only and you need to open 3 accounts to get started."
1,quality sucks,cd wouldn't read half way through. wouldn't recommend. do not buy this. you have been warned. not sure what else to write
5,Outstanding film!,I absolutely loved this movie! I went to go see it the weekend it came out and I enjoyed it so much!
3,"Entertaining, but lacking slightly","The one thing Iron Man has going for it is Robert Downey Jr who is just perfect for this role. He is a natural and really embodies the character just right. There is wit and charm and appeal. However, I found the movie a tad on the slow side and fairly predictable. There was no doubt in my mind who the 'bad guy' was, and I know nothing about this comic book.This film, though fun at times did not spark my interest like The Dark Knight or even Transformers did. There were boring lulls and nothing particularly interesting to fill the action-less void. Iron Man is certainly a very good comic book movie, far better than many I've seen, but certainly not the best. It will appeal to many, mostly, again, because of the main character's likeability and the very nice special effects the film has to offer."
4,Iron Man,Outstanding PQ & AQ. A great movie to watch. Special features are well above average and take you inside the movie. Recommended.
4,HEAVY METAL ENTERTAINMENT!,It's a blockbuster and one of the best comic book movie adaptations ever -- it's a fun popcorn flick!
4,excellent,"Great video, menus and extras, one of the best blu ray discs available.The image quality is incredible, but the sound is powerful.Most people talk about the blu ray video quality, but in my humble opinion the main difference with regular dvds is the sound, the sound difference is immediately noticeable."
5,best action film of summer '08 (besides Batman),"next to the Batman film (Dark Knight), Iron Man was by far the most enjoyable action film of summer '08. Great cast, great script, interesting CGI, well-acted and directed. I actually had FUN watching this in the theater. The action scenes with Iron Man in flight were awesome.Downey Jr. adds just the right touch of humor/anger in the role, and Paltrow has never looked more beautiful.I've heard the sequel comes out May 2010....I'll be the first one in line."
4,Total enjoyment,We totally enjoyed the 2 disc Collector's Edition DVD. The extra material is interesting and fills in a lot of the back story that is not seen in the feature. Action scenes are well done and there is enough comic relief to keep it fun.
3,Crappy ending ruins what otherwise was a pretty decent movie,"So you have a superhero who tells everyone who he is. Why not paint a bullseye on his back. Its one thing if your powers are obvious such as the F4 but to tell the world you developed this amazing combat suit is plain dumb. What kind of sequel can they make out of this.? Beats me.The Suit though was cool and sleek. A very good interpetation of the Iron Man Comic Uniform. Overall a decent plot, been done before though with the trusted manager turning out to be a crumb and turncoat. An Ok film with a defeatist ending imho."
4,Great movie,A instant classic. This movie is a must for any Marvel or action fan. Robert Downey Jr. is amazing as Iron Man and I now cannot picture any other Iron Man. Price was lower than the department stores also.
3,Good comic book adaptation.,"A little ridiculous in the technology feats (building a super-tech suit with hammers and a welder), but that's comic books.Jeff Bridges is awesome as the heavy."
4,Gritty,"Grittier than Iron Man 2, and not as polished, but still fun. Loud for grandma and junior. We liked it."
1,This disc will not play on most BR systems,"Beware this version of the disc will not play on the majority of Sony or Samsung BluRay systems. Paramount issued a recall of all discs recently, with a replacement due out soon.No word from Amazon about this."
1,As hard as him...,I find this movie boring... But I love the cinematography... I just find it quit impossible to make an invention and make your self as the sample... Hoping I can be as rich and as famous and brilliant as the person behind Iron Man...
1,BradyLaw,"I went on a Blu-ray buying spree on black Friday and when I received this item I was very disappointed. It advertises a blu-ray in the package as if it was from a store when in reality what you receive is a COPY in a plastic cd case.... Very lame and misleading to buyers, will not buy again."
3,Iron Man,A decent movie but nothing to RAVE about. It has a nice story line but too many holes. I didn't find it to be such a GREAT movie though. Just average would be my description.
2,The BR is horrible,"I will just rate it according to the merit of its video and audio part, not the movie itself.One word: BAD.Video: It has good details (HD grade), but the contrast and brightness is off, I have to lower the brightness by a huge amount, and pump up the contrast, the result is still not a 3D picture as you would expect from a BR movie. (6/10)Audio: This is where it sucks, the bass is liked farting inside a bag (sorry for the words, but it really is the best description), you don't feel it that much, the surround effect is minimum. You have to turn the volume up and then the dialogue may be too loud. May be it needs some huge adjustment as the video, but I have no time or interest to do it. (3/10)"
5,Iron Man=Iron Clad!!!!,"I am not going to bore you all with a million word review. I hate those kinds. To sum up this super-hero flick, AWESOME!!!"
4,Robert Downey Jr. actually does it as a superhero,I think that movie makers have to wait till the technology is there to produce a certain movie that might require sophisticated effects and not just wait for a good script and have the technology (if not mature enough) ruin the film. George Lucas did it with his Star Wars prequels and the producers of Iron Man chose to do it the same way too. The movie is a combination of a good script (many times side-lined in such movies) and very good special effects. Robert Downey proved he is a good actor in this movie by getting in the right shape required and as usuall living the role. Overall another Marvel hit which I'm sure will encourage Marvel to bring more and more of their superheros onto the big screen.
4,A VERY SOLID SCREEN ADAPTATION,"IRON MAN moved along at a break-neck pace, and for the most part, the plethora of CGI effects were never allowed to clobber some of the first-rate acting by Robert Downey Jr., Jeff Bridges, and Gwyneth Paltrow. There was also some extremely funny dialogue, and excellent physical humor by Downey, who for my money, is far less wooden than most of the super heroes buzzing around screendom these days ( with the notable exception of Ron Perlman ). Fun stuff."
5,Marvel's Best...'Nuff Said!,"I am not going to rehash the plot of the movie the way WAY TOO MANY reviewers do these days. Instead I am going to give you all you need to know. Go watch this film! It is BY FAR the BEST Marvel presentation to date. Granted, the original story was ""updated"" for the current audience, but the major points of the story remain the same. While I enjoyed Spiderman, I am just not sure who decides which villains to place in movies these days. That is my only fear for Iron Man 2 (which I am sure is coming). However, the first one, without a major super-villain was A BLAST. WHY? Becasue it actually told a story and didn't get caught up in trying to create an adversary for the hero...it actually focused on the hero. What novel concept! Way to go Marvel and everyone else involved. You got this one right! This one is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
3,Calls home,"I don't believe the studios. This product calls home when you play it unless you have BD-Live turned off. This should never be an automatic function. Click a menu and get bonus features, sure. This needs to be disclosed to all customers BEFORE they buy. Plus, they need to disclose what they're calling home for. I'll be returning it.""Iron Man was released [this week] on DVD and Blu-Ray and there is much ire in the Blu-Ray community regarding the BD-Live aspects of the disc. When the disc is first booted the disc loads some information from the internet and begins an auto download. This load is taking anywhere from 2 minutes to over 45 minutes."""
3,A lesson learned.,"Condition of the Video: I received this as a Christmas present. I could hear the dvd sliding around inside. Usually the videos are fine from here. Movie Review: I've seen the movie before and liked the beginning to the middle. After that, there was no imagination. It was a copycat of Robocop, after evil guy is discovered. However, since the first half of the movie was so good, I decided to own a copy. If the condition of the video was good, I would have given it 4 stars.Lesson Learned: Don't order videos around Christmas time."
2,Repackaging is not OK. Did not watch the movie.,"Dear Amazon,You sold me this product stating that it is new. I must say that there is no way that this product is new. I worked with the 2nd largest video/dvd chain and know DVD packaging when it is new. The shrinkwrap is not tight, there are no labels on the video, no security label, nothing. So come on Amazon. You repackaged this and sold it for new huh?I have to say I am dissapointed and embarrased that we gave it as a gift and it looked used....Tell me how this happened?Thank you."
3,A 'Meh-fest',"I may not be ""the guy"" to review this flick because frankly, I'm not a Marvel comic junky. When I reach into my holster for comic-to-cinema, I only come up with Spidey Part Deaux and Batman Begins...so there you have it.Do I love RDJ? Yesssssssss! Jeff Bridges, too for that matter. Still, I didn't get the smarmy fun out of this movie I was hoping for based on the pre-release hype. Certainly watchable even for the non-die-hards, I just can't find myself gushing over it as I hoped I would."
2,Super Hero,"Based on the Marvel comic book character, Tony Stark builds a high tech suit of armor to escape enemies. He's on a mission to save the world."
3,Iron Man,"Love the movie , but something with the DVD happens, between 55-65 minutes the movie statrts to skip and stop. This happen with 2 different Iron Man DVD's. Amazon was great with there return policy. Maybe I just had bad luck."
2,It's worth watching once.,"It has quite a few funny dialogues. The plot has depth. It shows the weaknesses of Ironman. For example, he recovered from alcohol addiction. It makes him more human. The special effects are so-so. It's worth seeing once."
3,Average At Best,"I barely made it all the way through this movie. It's too predictable and kind of boring in my opinion. I guessed a few lines correctly before the actors and/or actresses spoke. lol That's how predictable it is. I'll take ""Dark Knight"" over this any day."
3,Iron Man,I was very excited to know that i can watch this movie for 99cent but the down side was that it was cut off towards the end and now i would have to either rent the movie from itunes or just watch on cox demand. Thanks amazon you have come true again!
2,Single Disc Tiny Screen: Not 2.85:1,The Single Disc Version of this DVD is not Amoriphic...it's the skinny Widescreen so many of us hate. Go ahead and pay a bit more (if you can) for the 2 Disc Special Edition...which...I hope I'm right...is the Wide Widescreen (Amoriphic).Hope you notice this!
2,Depressingly bland,"The Bottom Line:The positive word-of-mouth about Iron Man all talked about what a ""new"" look at the superhero movie this was, so imagine my surprise when I sat down to watch this draggy and utterly formulaic ""origin story"" directed tediously and with little flair by Jon Favreau; with typical comic book types like the fetching assistant Pepper Potts (a bored Gwyneth Paltrow) and evil Iron Monger (scenery-chewing Jeff Bridges), an utterly boring plotline and some troubling inconsistencies (notice how just before Tony Stark has his epiphany about the evils of violence he takes the time to torch as many Arabs as he can) Iron Man is a surprisingly and depressingly bad film.2/4"
4,Good movie,it's a good movie. Gives you a nice glance at why Ironman is who he is. Robert Downey Jr. has another hit under his movie belt.
5,Love this movie,"Probably still my favorite superhero movie, and this version of it is terrific. I thought it looked great on Blu ray."
4,Better than I expected,"I really did not think that I would like this movie. It appeared, from the previews to be pro-war, and frankly, this turned me off. The content, however, was anything but what I assumed. I do have some gripes about the amalgamation of stereotypes though. Admittedly, the Arabic was spoken nice and slowly, and was relatively keeping with what the translations said. Still, I don't expect much from Hollywood when it comes to not perpetuating negative stereotypes."
4,"Hmmm, Robert Downey Jr.","I love just about any movie Robert Downey Jr. is in and this is no exception. Good action movie with a little bit of ""this is unbelievable"". It's a great family movie. And who doesn't like a superhero."
3,HAS ANYONE REALIZED???,"Has anyone realized that the DVD version has many missing parts to it? In the theatre, just in the beginning alone for example, where is the part where the blonde interviews Starke before they end up in bed together? What about the Casino part where he completely doesn't show for his award? What about all the witty commentary btwn Starke and the army squad driver/passengers?? I understand that there are deleted/extended scenes included on the DVD, BUT, I thought those were scenes that were extras that were never part of the original movie. Am I wrong in this?????? ALSO, even some of the deleted scenes were cut! So some of the movie that I saw in the theatre just plain doesn't even EXIST on the DVD! Is it a different story on the double disk edition or blue ray version?? They all claim to be a 125 minute play time so what the heck?? Someone enlighten me b/c I LOVED this movie in the theatre and I am very disappointed that I don't get the full version on my DVD!"
4,Entertaining,Wasn't sure if I would like this movie but Amazon had it on sale for under $2.00 so I figured I would give it a shot. Amazon also included as a bonus a digital version of the movie so I really had nothing to lose. I figured I would watch the digital version and if I didn't like it I could give the dvd as a gift. I watched the movie last night and I was entertained and surprised. Needles to say I will be keeping the hard copy.
5,IRON MAN BRU-RAY,IT WAS FUN TO WATCH AND ROBERT DOWNEY WAS THE PERFECT FOR THE ROLE OF TONY STARK AKA IRON MAN.
4,Ironman,"If you do not have this one in your collection by now. This you should do as so as possible. In due time, if you like this one, I hear there is a third one coming out to the big screen. Then to dvd/bluray. Add today to your collection. You won't have to play catch-up later."
4,Fun to Watch,I didn't know a lot about Iron Man but I like action/adventure movies and decided to give it a try. It totally blew me away. The special effects were awesome and the plot was great. Robert Downing Jr. was an excellent Tony Stark and I loved Gwenneth Paltrow's character. All the acting was excellent and I'm really happy I bought this movie. I'm really looking forward to the next one.
4,Good movie - outstanding blu-ray quality!,I loved this movie! Lots of action. I especially liked Downey's particular style of acting - very smooth. Jeff Bridges turned in an excellent performance also. I couldn't get over the unbelievable quality of the blu-ray. Audio and video are the best I've seen. There are some very funny lines and actions throughout. Good acting by Paltrow- she was beautifully stunning in this movie. Lots of special features. Highly recommended.
2,Robocop did it way better,"Well, the production values are good but the story is pretty forgettable. Totally formulaic and predictable, i'm surprised that Marvel doesn't have better writers to offer. Lacks the biting sense of humor that Robocop had, for example. Disappointing."
1,won't play on PS3,"Disc 1 wouldn't play on my PS3. I submitted a return through amazon (which is a really simple process). I hope the replacement I'm being sent works, but judging by what I've read online, I shouldn't hold my breath!!**update - I received a replacement from amazon the next day, and it worked perfectly. thanks amazon!!"
1,You should ALWAYS get what you order! Buyers BEWARE!!!!,"I have ordered used DVD's through Amazon.com ALL the time! It is the best way to save money, and I have always got EXACTLY what I ordered UNTIL NOW! The seller of this ""Two-Disc"" Iron Man Blu-ray sends me ONE disc... That is not even an ORIGINAL copy.. It was burnt at home and the Blu-ray cover, printed at HOME on HP paper! Besides false advertisement I am pretty sure that is against the law seeing as how they made 13.00 profit off of me for something that they never paid for to begin with. I am going to try and contact Amazon.com to see if I can get this seller removed but until then buyers BEWARE"
1,Ironman Flops,"This movie spends 7/8 of it building the plot. There are 2 action scenes, only one of which has any substance and duration. This movie cannot compare to any of the other comic book movies on any level. If there is a sequel it stands a slim chance of being good but it cannot be any worse. Ironman for a superhero is as weak a character as Magneto, or Aquaman, or Greenlantern. It cannot touch Superman, Batman or Spiderman. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.This cannot be classified as an action movie, it is a total sleeper."
4,Iron Man,"Great movie, my only gripe was with the packaging. It was in one of those small Amazon boxes that they use for books, and since I ordered something else (rechargable batteries) the box got a bit smashed and it dented the DVD case."
5,Yes it's that good,"Now I'm not a huge Marvel comics fan, but i have to say. Having read some of the Iron Man comics, this movie is spot on. Robert Downey Jr. does an awsome job as Tony Stark, the good thing is , that this movie isn't afraid to be a comic book movie. From watching Stark build his suit in the cave, to all the interactions with the other characters. This is a fun movie"
5,action packed,"My son downloaded this movie, we watched it several times till I got alerts to how much of my internet time was being taken streaming it. So we bought it on dvd and we also got ironman 2."
3,Ok but full of plot holes that make it hard to get into,Starts off well with a couple of good lines but then dives into a plot that is far-fetched (even by 'comic book' reality) and then contradicts itselfBut watchable just the once
5,Awesome,Robert Downey Jr. plays a great Tony Stark. The cinematography is also done very well. I particularly like the way his home robot interacts with him.
4,"Great Movie, Great website","Movie was great! I love all comic book movies, and this was one of my favorites."
5,Ironman,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my brother-in-law and he was elated! I was very glad for the swift delivery of Amazon, which got there surprisingly quick!"
4,A Pleasant Surprise,"I'm not a fan of superhero movies, but this one was a nice exception.I was surprised at how the story drew me in and the action kept me focused.Ironman is a good movie. 'Nuff said."
4,Grey Armour,"...they nailed it. As cool as the film was, that grey armour...clumsy, heavy, brutal...was the absolute true representation of a hero's outfit as portrayed in the comic. We'll never see Wolverine in yellow, but we got Iron Man in grey."
3,"Great movie, just got it,,just one little issue.","I bought the SINGLE DISC EDITION, this is my 3rd purchase from amazon. The movie is amazing, waited 2 weeks and a couple of days but was worth it. The picture in the front cover is great, the back of the case is not as cool the 2 disc edition but its ok. Now, there is a small portion of plastic removed from the side of the case( not the one where you open the case), it looked like someone bit that portion of plastic off. Im going to buy the new INCREDIBLE HULK dvd, so please AMAZON, be more careful with my next dvd. Anyway, trailers of the new Hulk, deleted scenes, NEW startrek trailer, so single disc is great if you dont want to spend more cash for the extra disc. I dont think anyone appreciates if their dvds came in damaged cases. The front and the back pictures are safe. Just that portion on the side. EXCELLENT MOVIE."
4,Sit on the edge of seat movie!,The sound effects were great - I thought the bullets were coming right at me. Great Movie everyone else agrees!We let our children watch this movie and had to have them close their eyes in some VERY violent scenes (at times my husband was the only one watching) and we had to fast-forward a sex scene at the beginning of the movie. HINT - watch all the credits you get a bonus!
5,Great Bluray,"I ordered Iron Man Bluray couple weeks ago, and i saw it couple times already. The video is quite impressive, so its the sound.A fun movie to watch with friends. Extras are good, Gag reel, documentaries, and Robert Downey jr. screen test among other things."
5,Classic IRON MAN,"I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF SHELL HEADS FOR A LONG TIME. I am glad to to see it done almost right. It is a good rendition,of the character. All the actors & actresses did a excellent job. Timing was very important, they held up good considering a few weak moments but, over all a very good job. When I say I am A fan of shellheads, I have been reading the series since 1964. Big fan of Tales of supsense, also. I hope they do Just as good a job on Thor as well. Any way get the movie even if it doesn't come out on full screen. Which would be even better on the plasma!! Grade A movie."
4,Enjoy the ride,Good stuff! The Blu-ray looks great. And its nice to know that more Iron Man is coming in 2010.
5,Greatest Action Packed flick of The Year!!,"A movie like Iron Man only comes out once every few years in my opinion. A movie that blows away the competition and leaves the viewer wanting more. After waiting for months on news of its DVD release I pre-ordered it from Amazon and couldn't be happier. Robert Downey Jr is definitely at his best, Jeff Bridges performance is equal as well.The DVD comes with loads of special features (at least on the two disc edition) and is a prize to behold."
1,IRON MAN,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE SAW IT AT THE THEATER WHEN IT CAME OUT. AS FAR AS THIS BLUE-RAY DVD THAT I PURCHASED FROM YOU, I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT IT WAS NOT A FULL SCREEN DVD. AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS MY SETTINGS ON MY FLAT SCREEN BUT I TRIED ""AVATAR"" WHICH I PURCHASED FROM YOU ALSO AND IT WAS FINE. FULL SCREEN AND BEAUTIFUL.I DON'T KNOW IF I WILL PURCHASE ANYMORE DVD FROM AMAZON.SUE ARENTVERY DISAPPOINTED"
1,Comic book characters... making millions of horrible movies these days.,"You people these days consider this a good movie? Haha. Who in their right mind believes that a bat character that drives a Pontiac Firebird clone can save the world from evil?For good and REAL action check out WWE, ECW, or TNA.For good classic Wrestling.. check out WCW and WWF."
4,Fun Movie,Enjoyed the pace of the movie. Plenty of action. Lots of fun watching with a subwoofer system.
2,Lots of eyecandy. Shallow storyline.,"The movie had lots of pretty visuals. And that's about it. A five-year old child could write a more imaginative scenario & dialogues. Spoiler: The line ""give me an American cheeseburger"" by Stark upon his return from captivity in Afghanistan, after which he is shown eating Burger King, seemed really cheap to me. It demonstrates what the movie is all about. If you are oblivious to propaganda and advertising, then you may enjoy this movie. Just my $0.02.PS: I did read the comic book as a kid and was a fan, whis is why I was disappointed with the cheap pseudo-patriotic ""American cheeseburger"" lines, the cliche Afghan terrorist stereotypes, and the rest of the shallow plot. The comic book used to be much more cult and intelligent than that..."
1,"led to believe "" extended scenes"" were in the movie","when 3 options are are in front of you, #1 blue ray , #2 standard edition ( which i already own from 2008) and #3 ULTIMATE EDITION WITH EXTENDED SCENES. I bought this ultimate copy expecting the extended version. the description said disc #1 feature with extended disc # 2 extras. i have seen the extended edition on TV so i wanted to add it to my collection. Very disappointed!!"
4,I liked everything except the ridiculous beginning,"I loved Iron Man comic books when I was a kid. I always wanted to see what Iron Man looked like moving, flying and punching in real-time. The only letdown was the ridiculous beginning when Tony Stark builds his first suit in a cave, pounding heated metal like a medieval blacksmith. However you can forget about the beginning or even fast forward past it and still enjoy the rest of the movie."
3,Iron Man 2 OK,"This is not a movie that you should be really pressed to see. It's just ok. It doesn't live up to the hype or expectations of Iron Man 1. There's not much action, it's more about Tony and his problems...(like we all have). Even the actions scenes are just ok. All in all it's just OK!! See my pattern here...(OK)."
5,B-list Super gets an A-list Treatment,"Iron Man is one of those all too rare big budget movies that actually delivers. Downey was born to play Tony Stark but the real hero of this movie is the screenplay. A well written story, great charactors and terrific special effects, put Iron Man on top of the Super heap!"
4,NOT JUST FOR KIDS,"I'M NOT A ""SUPER HEROES"" PERSON BUT THE SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE REALLY COOL. I ALSO LIKED THE CHARACTERS. DOWNEY AND PALTROW WORK REALLY WELL TOGETHER"
5,Great fun!!,I was quite impressed with Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man. The whole cast did a great job as well. I enjoyed the special effects and pace of the film.
4,I'm an iron man fan,"This is a good movie. I'm an iron man fan anyway, so naturally I'm going to give the movie good reviews. I bought the movie to keep in my video collection. Watched the movie before putting it away. It was just as enjoyable as when I saw it at the theater. I cant wait for the latest Iron Man movie in 2013."
5,This was a great movie. I am looking foward to more in the future.,Dont have any bad coments about this DVD. the pictur quality and sound was great. My son got me started in this type of movies and so far it has been injoyable.
4,a fun action film,Have watched this film on a few different occassions with our daughters over the years and always find it very entertaining.
5,Iron Man Iron Man,Gave to my nephew for Christmas present and he loved the movie. The package was well package and the items arrived on time. Thanks for a job well done.
4,Great Condition!,The movie was received exactly as described. The case is well preserved and the DVD runs beautifully.
3,A mixed bag,"Undoubtedly Blu Ray reference material - great audio and video. The story is a big mixed though. The SX are great, but the story seems forced and artificial. I'm not a comic book fan at all, and do not know the comic iron man story, so i'm likely at a disadvantage. however, the antagonist seems to just be there and be a formidable foe, no real development to that plot evolution. at the same time, this is an action movie first and foremost, so perhaps i'm asking too much. it just wasn't climactic - the final battle happens, and its not satisfying. otherwise, downey is awesome, the dialog is fun, etc."
5,This movie is one of the best!,Man What I would'nt give to be Iron Man. This is personaly better than The Inredible Hulk I mean everybody agrees and my favorite was when he went back to Afghanistan and kicked those Bad guys buts boy to me that was the best scene. and I see that after credit it goes to show you they are going to making a avengers movie and I mean the comic book ones with all the Marvel superheroes. Just wonder Why we gotta wait so long for captain america to come out 2011 I mean first it was gonna be 2009 now it's 2011.
3,Ok.,"I remember my first exposure to World Party was seeing them open for 10,000 Maniacs in 1993. What caught my ear the most was ""Is It Like Today"", and so I picked up ""Bang"". However, besides that totally great song, the rest of this is a bit weaker, and not much else really stands-out. ""Sunshine"" and ""Hollywood"" are the best of the rest. I also bought the album ""Goodbye Jumbo"", and found that it's much stronger front to back, and is usually the one of the two that I play. ""Is It Like Today"" makes this worth getting used, and it is a decent album. What we need is a collection released, be it ""Sooner Or Later""."
5,"More experimental, still great","This is usually one of the lower-reviewed of his albums, but it may be my favorite -- it's probably the one that goes the farthest beyond traditional folk-rock into dance and funk (meaning, drum machines). Amazing variety of styles on one album -- you hear the usual influences mentioned for World Party loud and clear here (the Beatles, Dylan, Stones), but a few new ones are apparent. For some reason, World Party can come close to downright copying of styles (was that a bit of the Who's ""Gettin in Tune"" in there somewhere?), but I'm never bothered as I am with other bands like Oasis or Smashmouth. Probably has something to do with monumental talent..."
4,Diverse and inspired Gem of a collection!,"In short, my favorite World Party Disc. Great Tunes like ""is it like today"" are fun, catchy and inventive in some of the appraches Karl takes. It's the kind of collection that has such great writing mix and fab. sonic mix.Go for it! Holds up well since it's debut in 1992. Or... get ""Is it like today"" and ""Kingdom Come"" as great singles to sample."
5,listening to this cd,this is a wonderful cd. i have it in my car and listen to it all the time. you wont go wrong buying this cd if you love the operah and great voices.
3,Amor--Opera;s Great Love Songs,"I absolutely love opera music, and this c.d. is great for the most part. However, I am completely shocked that Maria Callas is nowhere to be found! In my opinion Callas' versions of Vissi D'arte, Vissi D'amore, L'Amour Est Un Oiseau Rebelle, Oh! MI Babbino Caro, Signore, Ascolta!, and Un bel di vedremo were much better than the versions feature on this c.d. Even Tribaldi made the list! If people enjoy amazing opera music, they would be better off buying a c.d. by Maria Callas. Of course, Pavarotti is also amazing."
5,Liszt's Rhapsody- a must watch!,my sister and i wached this video and loved itit is halarois ( thenx to peter kelgan) and really authentic (GEORDIE JOHNSON)so watchitu wont be disapointed!
1,BAD STORY great music!,"This sad fictional account of Liszt makes this great monumental artist seem like a lame duck. A far better story could have been created to show Liszt as the great artist and person he really was... as those great qualities are enough to procure admiration and instill motivation in any young child! So please, dispense with giving children the notion that this great man was a wimp! It's only Liszt's music that rescues this tale from ""zero stars"" oblivion!"
3,Not what I expected but good,"The cartoon I was looking for was the original ""Horton Hatches the Egg"" aired in 1942 by Looney Tunes. This video was good for children and Billy Crystal did well with the voices of the different characters"
5,Seuss,"My favorite childhood story with a great catch line....""I meant what I said and I said what I meant""...great phrase to live by!!!!Horton Hatches the Egg is wonderful!!!!"
2,inexpensive; poor lighting = poor picture,"This Vibra WebCam is inexpensive but has mediocre picture quality in all but the perfect lighting conditions. Installation was simple and straightforward, didn't cause crashes like others have said (but your mileage may vary), and was recognized by all of the capturing programs I had. The webcam image had a lot of banding in low and overlighting conditions that wasn't correctable through the included driver. If you're in a pinch, don't have lots of money to spend on a webcam, and have full control of the lighting in the room, this will do the job. Otherwise, pass on this product."
4,Great camera for the price,"I purchased two of these, one for me, and one for my girlfriend for use at college. So far we've had no problems with them, with fairly good picture quality. At these prices, especially with the rebate I'd have no problem recommending them to anyone."
2,Good for the price,I got it 2 years back for $25. It hurts when I see i see it for $10. Not much features in it and quality is not that great.
4,Good basic webcam.,"For the price, this camera is pretty good. It does the job. Only problem is that one can't attach it to the monitor. It needs to be place on a flat surface. It's good for someone who needs a basic no-frills webcam."
2,"So-so, pretty circumscribed","I saw a pair of American avocets in Death Valley in March, 2006. With the help of a ranger at Furnace Creek, I was able to identify them from a National Geographic guide.Are they in this guide? Even though Death Valley is part of their normal flyover range? No.And that's exactly why this -- and other Audubon guides, from my experience -- just fall short in many ways compared to National Geographic or Peterson.Now, it's true, you'll get more depth of coverage in the species that are actually covered. But, whether birds, trees, or shrubs, if the lifeform isn't pictured or described, all the ""depth of coverage"" in the world does you no good."
3,disapointed!,"The book I received was exactly what I wanted, however.... the entire back cover was torn away from the book. I purchased the book as in good/very good condition. I didn't know that I would have to glue the book together before I could ""use"" it! Very disapointing!"
2,"Of limited use for identification of cacti, shrubs, grasses.","I recently used this book as a field guide during a February visit to the Sonoran desert. I would have to rate the guide as poor for winter identification of cacti, shrubs and grasses. Only a limited number representative species were included and the small sketches were of little use unless I already knew what I was looking at."
5,Premier information for desert dwellers.,"The National Audubon Guide to Deserts, which covers the four deserts of the southwest, is informative about both flora and fauna (including insects) and the pictures are very helpful in identifying birds, bugs, reptile, etc. The Desert book section on the various landforms is interesting; the desert is not just sand. We live in the southern Mojave desert; our grandson learned to read looking through the photo section of the Desert book, and picking ""Mojave"" out as designating animals he saw around our place. My only criticism, and it's really just a wish, is for more pictures. However, I understand with the broad scope of coverage it would be impossible to include photos of everything. I highly recommend this book to all desert dwellers, and their families."
4,Cranberry Twist Tea,It does not have a strong distinctive flavor to it but great for digestion. Follow the directions though. Its not to be used daily.
1,Wrong item sent,"I ordered two boxes of Cranberry twist tea. The first box was fine, but we just opened the second box and found that it was cinnamon instead of cranberry. We cannot return it because we don't have any other to drink, and do not want to go without. I guess we just have to choke it down, but it is very disappointing to get the wrong thing."
3,Disappointing but intriguing,"The second Kozik book is disappointing but not without its charms. Contrary to a previous review, I find the production value VERY poor, with confusing background overprinting and thin magazine paper ultimately taking focus away from the images themselves. Too much reliance on computer graphics cripples the low-brow immediacy of the best of Kozik's ""art.""Kozik's recent stuff isn't up to the level of his earlier work --he'd probably be the first to admit this! This book is certainly worth getting for Kozik completists and those interested in poster art's slide into the 21st century.If you DON'T have the first Kozik book, ""Man's Ruin,"" GO GET IT NOW!!!"
1,Ode to Kozik,"While this book has nice production values, Kozik's work lacks any true sense of originality or invention. Recycled imagery, day-glow colors...somehow it all comes off as second-hand poster art."
2,Great if you like crumbs,"These rice cakes have very little flavor and are very crumbly. I have thrown away the equivelent to 2 from all of the crumbs. The flavor is barely there and tastes more like a rice cake than the flavor says. This flavor is slightly better than the Honey Nut flavor but still nothing but crumbs. I will go back to the Quaker brand, they are worth the extra money."
4,It's O.K. with me but I like the Honey nut better,"Taste a bit like Apple Jacks :DKellogg's Apple Jacks Cereal, 17-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4)Haven't had in awhile. I eat these like Pop Corn which I can't have now...Like I Stated on the sub the ones I really like areLundberg Eco-Farmed Honey Nut Rice Cake, 9.5-Ounce Units (Pack of 12)taste a bit like Cracker jacks!!! :D Eat like Pop Corn:D"
5,Mathematics and the Physical World by Morris Kline,"This work is an excellent reference for the history ofmathematics. It begins describing some ancient numberingsystems. i.e. The Hindus utilized negative numbers. There wasan evolution in geometry. The development and refinement ofcurves were set forth into equations. Newton's laws wereformulated . i.e. F= MAThe motion of projectiles evolved into the use of the sine andcosine to describe curvilinear motion. The laws of gravity,motion and oscillations were refined further into a multiplicity of uses in mathematics and theoretical physics. Many of the fundamentallaws and processes of the earlier mathematics have evolved intoimportant applications in theoretical and practical engineering.Examples are Newton's Laws, the Bernoulli equations and a hostof other scientific achievements."
2,A guided tour of Rome in one afternoon! (Caveat Emptor),"To the extent that this book collects many historical stories next to simple descriptions of mathematical ideas, reading _some_ parts of this book can be rewarding to _some_ people. But, the book over-reaches and over-promises. I also found the writing style annoying because the actual ""per-page"" ratio of _useful_ and _relevant_ information is low.In retrospect, it is obvious that grand claims are always ""red flags"" - e.g. imagine a tourist on her first trip to Rome signing up for a guided tour that claims to show all of Rome in one afternoon."
3,A sort of nightmare,"A twisted story of a male-female music band, where he became a victim of a mistaken identity by being mixed with a cousin-serial killer, and she herself was brutally victimised and used to serve both males.A sort of nightmare (Hostel (Unrated Widescreen Edition),Wolf Creek), where sex with bird and using screws followed pragmatic tortures to find out bankcard's passwords.Yeah, it is for the very special viewing."
3,Hayward System,"!!!!!!!ATTENTION!!!!!!NOT FOR INGROUND POOLS!!!!!!!!!I ordered this for my inground pool. Nowhere in the Amazon description does it state this, so it went for an expensive ride to my address and back to Amazon.Amazon gave me full credit!Will not work for this application as the pump is gravity fed and can't draw enough suction to operate a inground system.I only gave three stars because of this. It may be a good system otherwise."
3,"Inferior to OP8, but Gelb continues to be brilliant","Howie Gelb is one of the more under-known of American guitarists and songwriters. In recent years he's really managed to weave his whimsy and dead-seriousness into a very distinct rattlesnake-in-the-desert-sun Southwest moody sound, and it works. That said, his previous cd, OP8, is one of his best, a crowning achievement, and this cd includes a few tracks from that collaboration re-arranged. Except for intellectual curiosity, even a fan like me must acknowledge they aren't as good as the same tracks on OP8. Just don't expect them to be better. If you like Howie Gelb, and don't own OP8, you're missing out."
5,"A comforting gift, a great help in grief.","I was given this book upon the death of my mother, and found it wonderfully comforting, healing and helpful. This book is a small package with a big heart -- a thoughtful thing to do for a bereaved friend or family member."
2,Fastening straps are defective,"Fastening straps are not strong for 40lbs vest. They broke right off. As expected, with ""one size fits all"" it may not fit snugly. Look for better product, if one likes to use 20lbs or more weight."
3,NOT WHATS ON PICTURE,"Doesn't look anything like advertised, not very good quality. its pretty crappy, theirs no sides and not enough support. I do not recommend this product."
1,"Just like all the others, GoFit has fallen","My main issue is that the vest shown in the picture is NOT the adjustable weight vest being sold by Amazon. The picture shows the original model weight vest with sand packet weights stitched into the vest. This neoprene, non-adjustable vest is the only one I ever found that fit comfortably for all day wear, and had enough bend to be worn during martial arts practices. Almost every manufacturer today uses the steel shot packets which never conform right, are uncomfortable to wear, and have almost no give when doing simple exercises like sit ups. If you must go with steel in your vest, try another product, because this one is sub par on every level. If I wanted steel in my vest, I would have paid the extra money for an X-Vest (which goes up to 84lbs, is antibacterial, antimicrobial, and made for underwater training as well)!GoFit 40-Pound Weighted Vest"
2,You get what you pay for,"Pros: Cheap. Reasonable comfortable.Cons: Getting the weight packets in and out of the pouches is difficult. Additionally, the slits on said pouches is already tearing, as is the belt to fasten this thing. I like to vary the weight on this a lot, which makes the adjustablity concerns serious. Also, the durability is a major concern.Bottom line: Spend more on a better product."
2,Beware: Weak strap design!,"I just used this product for the first time and I am very disappointed.I do most of my workout at home with dumbbells, pullups, and pushups (a lot of pushups!). I was really excited to workout for the first time with this vest. During my first set of pushups with the vest on I felt a ""pop"" on the right side of the vest. The seams on the right strap had completely seperated and I also found the left seam had began to seperate. I will be returning this product shortly.If you only plan on wearing this vest for walk or light running, it may work. However, it will not work for pushups."
5,Weight me down!,Excellent product. Durable and has velcros for easy on easy off and makes it adjustble. Weights do not come out. So I got another vest for my son after he got used to the weight with one on.
2,I shouldn't need ducktape!,"I purchased this weightvest Aug 22 and have been training with it for about 6 weeks now. I am a 5'6"" female training with it for the CPAT. I use it about 2/3 times a week. I would like to use it more than that but now it is ripping at the sides! I'm so disappointed because I wanted to lend it to my brother for his training when I was done using it.SO -- I'm going to see if black duck tape will help save this investment.Also, the picture they have displayed looks a lot shorter online than it is in person. It hits just below my hips. That is not a problem but just so you know."
2,Weak Material,"Maybe i use this vest too much, but i figured a weight vest is for people trying to man up and get bigger. Ive had the vest for about a month and the belt used to tighten the vest around you is made out of some type of rubber material that stretches. My belt is hanging on by a thread. The weights are removable, and enclosed by the same rubbery material. after a while, i think im going to have to think up some way to keep the steel bags in place. I know for a fact that im going to have to rip off the chinese belt and attach some sort of heavy duty fabric myself to do the job. i wanted this thing to be tough and long-lasting. in actuality it lives up to its made in china reputation. but i guess its hard to come across anything made to last these days...Glenn"
2,easy to (and should) have better design,"Too many individual weights deal with. If you want to adjust the weight, takes way too long and too much trouble. The weights should be incremental. That is, why not have a 10#, some 5#, 2&1/2#, and 1# weights that are easy to take out and put back in. Otherwise, the adustablility is useless because of the difficulty and hassle of having to do 1# at a time. I returned this product because of this defect."
2,Belt Tore,The velcro belt tore off after the second use! Within a week of Purchase! The material for the vest is not durable enough for so much weight.
4,great but heavy,"be expecting this thing to be or get heavy as you were it, there are individual sandbag weights you can remove to make it light though. be aware that this this is not discrete, you can only wear it under a large coat, so wearing it in public isn't a good idea"
5,Tippy top- one of the most inspiring books about artists !,"MUST, I REALLY Must salute this perhaps dated, but CLASSIC of a book about artists..Growing up in an ignorant town in AlabamaArtistically inclined , and with little inspirationTHIS was a delicious eye-openerChock full of insightful interviewsand photos of these artists in their studios, lovingly documented, down to their palettes.This is a soul ful, delectable book about artists .I heartilly urge, especially art students to just GRAB this, without hesitation ..."
3,love hate the book,"Since there are two different books published or even three maybe with two different covers even I am not sure which one I got. The photos are at times very dark and because of the other published books available I constantly question in my mind that if the other books out there have better photographs then the book I was sent that I was cheated in a way. All in all I love the book for the read but not that happy with most of the photographs, but still I have this little nagging thought in my mind that the other ones had better photographs. My thought make very sure which book you get. You might get luckier than I did."
1,"Nice dvd cover, thats about it","This movie was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The plot has been done over and over in bollywood so many times. Basically the same movie as Bride and Prejudice, but an extreemly poor version.I bought the movie for the henna scene, which lasted all of 2 seconds."
3,Amber Stone Earrings,"Although lovely, these earrings are very small. The stones are a bit darker and less sparkly than the photo. The earrings are too small to make the impact that you would expect from the photo. It is very difficult to see the beautiful craftsmanship. Wish they were larger. Perfect for a teen or pre teen."
4,by far my favorite,I basically love all olives but these by far are my favorite! They are soft and just perfectly salted and don't have an overwhelming fishy taste.
2,Not enough flavor for me,"I think there is a big difference between minced anchovy filling for an olive and a whole anchovey filling. The minced variety like this brand do not have the robust flavor of whole anchovies. The minced ones are not bad and are actually a lot easier to find, but I definitely prefer the whole anchovy variety."
3,Long Hair,"I purchased this based on reviews and while it is a good product it doesn't work that well on really long hair. It does leave your hair soft (almost too soft)and takes care of the frizzes but, there isn't enough hold. It kind of weighs your hair down."
3,same as most others,This product works ok...it's about the same as most others though. I have yet to find any products for curly hair that I have been ecstatic about...so maybe my hair is just more difficult than other women with curly hair.
3,not what I thought,"I was confused by the description. I thought it meant the product would be good for my very thick hair. When the bottle arrived and I read the back, I realized the product was supposed to make your hair thicker. I'm still looking forward to trying the correct type of Bumble & bumble creme to tame my thick, curly hair.a consumer near Philadelphia"
2,Not the same as in a salon,"I originally first bought this product from a salon at a much higher price of course. When the one I order arrived, it did not work as well as the salon one. Packaging was different which was noted in the description not that that should matter. It has a liquid film at the top which the salon one did not. Now I understand why salon offer products at a higher price....Quality is worth it!!"
2,Frizzy Curls,Sad to say that this product made my curls lifeless and frizzy by the end of the day. I have african-american hair and achieve EXCELLENT tight spiral curls after shampooing and conditioning. This product did not make my curls POP like they would if I left a basic leave in conditioner on it.
3,I didn't quite enjoyed it,"It didn't work my curly hair was very bad, it didn't work. It was suppose to reveal a wavy look.I didn't enjoyed this purchase."
2,Hmmm....,I purchased this as a stocking stuffer for me 20something daughter. Didn't realize it at the time but the bottle was not sealed nor did it look to be a new bottle. She hasn't said anything to me about it yet so not sure if she's tried it..I'm hoping it's okay! I assumed at this price I would at least receive a sealed unopened bottle! Bummer!!! Won't buy from this seller again
4,A little bit goes a long way!,"This is a great product to control my frizzes without weighing my hair down. I have wavy-curly hair that tends to either frizz or go limp depending on the product... this cream has been a happy medium for me. I combine it with a bit of serum and scrunch, and presto! Well controlled waves, even in 90% humidity."
2,No change..,I'm multi racial and have somewhat of a frizzy/curly afro. I tried this product a few times on my hair and it had no effect. It smells nice though
1,Horrible New Formula,"After using this product for years, B&B recently changed formula along with packaging. Why ruin a good thing? The new formula is gooey and frizzes my curls! It does not define the curls, which the other product did. Garnier makes a $4 drugstore product that is exactly like this. Be warned that if you have thick curls and/or coarse hair, this is NOT the product for you. It does not ""calm"" and is definitely no longer a ""creme"", so the packaging is misleading. The texture is more like a gel and as opposed to coming out of the bottle like a creme, oozes into your hand and feels slimy in your hands on and on your hair. It is not a pleasant experience and I am really disappointed that they ruined it!"
4,Worth the money!,"This product gives your hair great volume without looking greasy.(Be careful not to use too much!) It works best if you have a little time to diffuse your hair with a blow dryer! Not surprisingly, when I use curl conscious many people will compliment the curls and the depth it adds to my hair :)I wish it would combat frizz a little more, but my hair is less frizzy when I use it. I guess the next thing I'll try is the Bumble and Bumble Frizz Fighter!"
5,Lovely,"Every curl product i've ever used has either failed utterly or transformed my hair into a crunchy, stiff mess that looks wet-and immobile- for the entire day.I bought this product hoping it would live up to its hype. The moment I got it in the mail I rushed to the shower to rinse all the other numerous products out of my hair. I applied it and waited for my hair to dry- every curly-haired person knows that the moment of truth comes when your hair has finally dried. I trusted it so much, after I applied it I went to class immediately without even bringing a backup=plan, should this cucumber-scented cream fail me (like, bobby pins- or a hat).I am currently siting in lecture stroking my unbelievably soft-and dry- hair and admiring my springy, structured curls in the reflection from my laptop monitor. I literally cannot believe this product has dried in my hair and left it feeling supple instead of fried and crunchy.Bumble and Bumble, I am your fan!"
5,Great soft curls - not sticky,"I have notoriously straw-like hair, and this is the only product I've tried that gives me soft, loose curls with some hold. I've also tried the one for fine hair because I feared this one would have more ""crunch"" to it. It works well too, but this one seems to work better for me."
2,Average,"Tracks 1 and 2 are fine, if not terribly memorable. Catchy, upbeat arrangement that offers nothing new, with run-of-the-mill songwriting. Track 3 (the long remix) is unspectacular dance fodder. Maybe [CD2] is better? All the same I'm afraid the name 'Soft Cell' doesn't carry that special meaning anymore these days."
1,sucks,"I actually have SF Ai Studio. While the software does a lot compared to the scanning software provided with my Epson scanner, it crashes all the time. Their tech support is incapable of figuring out why and don't seem too bothered about it. Sadly, they can get away with this since there's little competition. How they live with themselves is beyond me."
1,Not up to the standards set by earlier versions,"I agree with the criticism of the ""new"" seventh edition. In reading the posted material the compliments are specifically for the sixth edition. The standards set by the previous versions of Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine have not been sustained. The wealth of authoritative information and references have been removed from the printed version making it exceedingly difficult for library patrons to access the material. Missing from this version are the wonderful wealth of photographs, electron micrographs and other authoritative source material. This version leaves me looking for a better textbook or continuing to use the more authoritative sixth edition."
5,Great book!,"Yes, the book is lengthy, as any good medical book. If you really want to learn derm and understand the diseases, stick to traditional books like this..."
1,Disaster,"Trying to purchase this two volume set through AMAZON was a DISASTER! The order was shipped and only one of the two volumes arrived. I returned the one volume and AMAZON reshipped the order. Again, only volume two arrived. I finally had to cancel the order with AMAZON and ordered it directly from the publisher ~ McGraw Hill Medical. AMAZON has not explained the basis for the problem, but McGraw Hill ships the two volumes together in shrink wrap. Somehow, the two volumes (which look identical except for the volume number) were removed from the shrink wrap and, in each case, only volume 2 was shipped by AMAZON."
4,Continuously interesting...,"This is the final volume to date in Arkham House's decades-long effort to get Lovecraft between hard covers. With a literary style honed on the finest 18th Century models, Lovecraft is a continuously interesting writer, and this volume covers a vast miscellany of his output, from hilarious dime-novel imitations written by the pre-teen Lovecraft, to some of the last heartrending notebook entries from just before his untimely death. If you love Lovecraft, you need this one."
5,The best collection of Lovecraft writeings available,"This book exceded all my expectations. Some of Lovecraft's best writeing was done in the very short storys. One in particular called ""What the moon brings"" was Lovecraft at his best. Not only does this book give you some of his best fiction it also gives you a lot of non-fiction and some interesting views on Lovecraft himself. If you are a Lovecraft fan then you should definitly check this book out. You WILL NOT be disapointed."
3,Cumbersome,"I bought these flash-card with hopes of avoiding the time-consuming process of making my own. While the cards contain adequate information, I find the ""clinical vingette"" format cumbersome when simply trying to nail down the basics. That said, I've heard other people like these cards--so there you have it--they're just not my cup of tea."
2,Too many mistakes.,"The mistakes on these cards make concepts really frustrating and confusing. Sometimes multiple mistakes per card... I am very happy with the layout and clinical vignettes, though. They don't seem too wordy. Just enough info for me."
1,Fake reviewers,I am afraid that the 3 reviewrs before me are the same person.Amazon makes it quite easy for promotional wizards to do that so sales can be increased.So far there is not even one review that tackes or critisizes this book. Are we all that perfect or should we become a victims of made up book?
3,Much worse than Hull's book,"Ho and Lee's book is not bad, but not as good as Hull's book. First, this book tries to include everything, making it not easy to learn for beginners. Second, the definition in this book is not very clear as hull's book. Third, after reading the book, I really don't know what are models for and how to implement these models; hence, I still have to refer these model from Hull's book."
5,a cheat-sheet to who's who in American authors,I truly enjoyed how this books gives us the most tasty morsels of some of the greatest writers in America. This book will encourage anyone to find out more about the author and read all of his works. I give this two thumbs up very easily!
3,50% Good / 50% Not so Good,"I got this product for my phone/fax. It's works fine for my fax, but not for my phone line. There is so much static on the phone, it's useless. I ended up having to call the phone company to install a new jack. I gave it 3 stars for the fax."
1,Don't waste your time,"I purchased this item Mar 25th through Amazon or rather one of their vendors named ""Buy Accessories"". BTW although the item is advertised as a Belkin product it is not an actual Belkin product but rather a Phonex product simply re-branded under the Belkin name. The item didn't come with instructions and the only place to find the instructions is on the Phonex website. Regardless after trying multiple spots in my home I could not find a place where I could get a clear dial tone without a great deal of static. I have asked for a refund and will hopefully be able to get my money back."
2,"Says caller ID compatible, but...","Recently ordered a Belkin-F8V1027 Wireless Phone Jack. The packing slip indicated Belkin, the product box indicated Belkin, the actual product was a Phonex PX-441. Same unit? Hard to say.Specifically ordered the Belkin because of the caller ID feature. It did not work. Phonex' website indicated that the the base unit needed to be a Rev 4: I received a Rev 3. Regardless, the unit does not work as advertised."
3,Not good for connecting a Motorola DECT 6.0 phone to MagicJack,"I had a really nice Motorola L404 DECT 6.0 cordless phone with 4 handsets that would not ring using MagicJack, so I attempted to use this Wireless Phone/Modem Jack between those two devices because I read it would provide a proper sine wave ring tone to the DECT phone. Well, it gave the Motorola phone a ring tone - if the Wireless transmitter and receiver were next to each other, plugged into the same AC circuit - but it also introduced a lot of hum on the phone connection. My ultimate solution was to buy a Uniden DCT15885AM DECT 6.0 5-handset phone that works fine with the square wave ring tone generated by MagicJack. I hope this info helps someone with the problem I had."
5,Worth the money!,My satellite receiver needed to be connected to a continuous phone line.I had priced this same type product at other locations for $60.00 and more. I am very pleased with my purchase and paid one third the price!
1,wireless phone jack,"product does not work satisfactorily. I did receive a wireless dial tone, but the static and made it unuseable, even at a short distance from the transmitter. Seller took the product back and remimbursed total cost including shipping."
2,"dumbed down french, very superficial","I have to be very motivated to write a review on anything. What motivates me here is how painful it is to watch this DVD lesson more than once. It seems to me to be high on hype and low on substance. Many so so jokes and good looking actors, but very little though in helpful repetition or anything much ""beyond the basics"". Too much fluff, too little substance. Also would be better to have actors who are native french speakers to learn from."
5,underrated band of the 1990s,"I became a veruca salt fan when eight arms came out in 1997, I figured it was worth a shot to purchase the album even though I had only heard volcano girls. It became one my favorite along with garbage's two albums. I immedialty had to find american thighs which is also a masterpiece. Every track on these albums are great with Nina and Louise blending their voices. Hard to pick favorites but tracks that stand out are ""Loneiness is Worse"" and ""Shutterbug"". I wish the girls could work out their differences and continue with Veruca Salt but I am glad for these albums and good luck to both as Nina releases her solo material and Louise continues on with VS."
4,"A little more pop, but still rockin'!","Though not as lyrically deep and having more of a pop flair than Ameircan Thighs, EATHY still rocks. It's sad that VS broke up, but this album still proves that knew how to evolve and can still rock with the best of 'em. Fav. tracks are ""Morning Sad"", ""Straight"", ""Volcano Girls"", and ""Shutterbug"". A good follow-up to EATHY."
5,MUST HAVE for Alterative Rock fans,"This is my favorite of Veruca Salt, a band I have been listening to over and over for the last few months. This band is basically too good for most radio stations to play. If you enjoy bands like REM, The Sex Pistols, and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and hate bands like the Counting Crows (yuk!) then you should get this."
4,4 stars just for paying homage to the Beatles!,"I haven't heard this album, I listened to the song Volcano Girls based on Amazon's comment about the song containing an homage to I Am The Walrus. It's actually Glass Onion that's being referenced. It says ""I told you about the Seether before/You know the one that's neither nor/Well here's another clue if you please/The Seether's Louise"". Very clever homage to a lesser-known Beatle song."
5,this cd is a must have,"if there ever was a cd that you needed to buy, it would be eight arms to hold you. i personally think that the best song on it is ""one last time"" but all the other ones are great too, the only not so good track is ""earthcrosser"". when i bought this cd i thought i didn't like it, but after listening to it a few times, i loved it. it's one of my favorite cds. everybody needs to have one."
4,"In a word, ""Awesome"".","Their debut was so good that I thought anything else from them would be disappointing, so I didn't get this album for years. Now that I have it, I forget that many bands can make more than one great album. I won't say this is as great as ""American Thighs"", but ""Eight Arms To Hold You"" is the next best thing. It's got the big single like ""Volcano Girls"", beautiful ballad-ish tracks like ""Benjamin"", and plenty more 4-star songs like ""Don't Make Me Prove It"", ""With David Bowie"", and ""Morning Sad"". It's a sophomore album that many may like more than the first, and the last album with the Post-Gordon partnership. Too bad they couldn't stay together, they made a great pair. I saw their first tour with Hole, and they blew Courtney away. Don't wait on this like I did."
4,One of the best girl rock alternative bands of the 90s,"Amazing colaboration between two extremely talented, funny and beautifull girls , Nina Gordon and Louise Post, Miss Gordon compositions and Miss Post riffs and also lyrics are plenty of intelligent feminist topics, music is also heavy , energetic these girls definitelly rock!!!!.HM"
5,"This CD is ""Awesome""","This CD, along with American Thighs, is awesome. Seeing them perform live was amasing, I'm glad I got a chance before they broke up. They really know how to play a guitar! In fact I'm going to be buying a guitar soon, I hope someday I'll be able to play as awesome as they do. The song ""Stoneface"" kicks butt."
3,"catchy, but watered-down chick rock","There were a slew of vital, trail-blazing female artists around the time Veruca Salt had a hit with ""Seether,"" and this followup doesn't really do much to elevate Veruca Salt past their contemporaries, particularly The Breeders, whose Last Splash was both more fun and more intelligent than this record. However, Eight Arms To Hold You is a pretty good pop record at parts - ""Benjamin"" and ""Loneliness Is Worse"" could have been early-90's pop power ballads, ""Don't Make Me Prove It"" and ""Stoneface"" have a great spunk to them, and ""Shutterbug"" portrays the band as cleverer than you would have guessed. To get yourself into good female rock groups that take risks, buy a Sleater-Kinney album, but for simple pop pleasures, you could do worse than this."
3,OK PPV For WCW would be Their last,"Hey there WCW Fall Brawl Was an ok PPV. Sting vs Hulk Hogan For the WCW championship. Great match sting winning and going heel along with lex luger Classic. Also had goldberg vs DDP, Ok Match Goldberg wins by pinfall. And Sid vs Chris Benoit for the US Championship. Good Match Sid Winning the US championship. If you like fall brawl then you will enjoy tyhis one i promise take care"
4,"Great for the time, but the newer ones are even better","This Jawa was great for the time, and for a while was the best one out there. However, now there's newer versions that are much better and have more joints. I particularly like the one with the Treadwell droid."
3,A Worrisome Trend for the SNZ,"The SNZ may be the most creative and musically interesting of all the new swing bands, but this CD does not display the band at its best. Overall, the music seems less ""consumer oriented,"" less anxious to please, and more interested in experimentation with strange new noises. I'm a loyal Zipperhead, but I hope this CD doesn't indicate that the band is drifting from its roots. It breaks my heart, but I can't recommend it too highly."
1,Not even close to HOT,I bought this CD because I love HOT. What a mistake. This doesn't even come close. It doesn't have the same zest or life. I am starting to think that they were trying to put out a bad album.
5,:),"This Cd is the best CD i own! SNZ has its own type of music, a blend of swing, zydeco, jazz, big band and rock. This CD will appeal to almost anyone of any age. All my freinds were skeptical of it at first, but after listening they all want to know where they can get it! A GREAT CD!"
4,How 'bout that crazy ghost? :),"I've really loved the SNZ before, and was looking forward to this CD quite a bit. Unfortunetly I was a little disapointed. There are some amazingly great songs in here (3,5 and 7) but there were also some that do nothing for me. Still the SNZ are always great to listen to even if I didn't feel everything was up to their very best. Besides, they're a fun band no matter what."
2,"Couple of hot tunes, but otherwise not terribly good.","I bought this one on faith because all of their other CD were outstanding. Other than ""Trou Macacq"", and ""The Ghost of Steven Foster"" I didn't think much of this CD. Better luck next time!"
5,Best So Far-- But It's Not Swing,"And never has been. SNZ hit a more potent era, right around 1932, when swing was just one of the many possible futures of music. The jazz-pop fusion of the twenties had matured and was just ready to explode.Be that as it may, this disc is super! There's depth and bite and tunes that just grow and grow on you. I could listen to ""Soon"" for the rest of my life! If you're new to these guys, this is where to start."
5,Not for everyone,"This is a great album. I bought this disc a long time ago when it first came out and I still listen to it frequently. This type of music is certainly not for everyone. It's an eclectic sound with ragtime, blues and jazz influences. If you like any of those styles you should give this band and especially this album a try."
4,Refreshingly Retro,"Some reviews have stated that this album is not as good as Hot, and with that, I agree, for the most part. But the mix of horns, stand-up bass, banjo, and fiddle; the vocal trio of Mathus, Maxwell, and Whalen; and the eclectic blend of styles that SNZ brings to the table all work to create a sound that is refreshingly retro in this day of rap, hip-hop, and dance (i.e. MTV music, and I use that word loosely)."
1,It's just not the same...,"I've listened to my previously purchased Squirrel Nut zippers so much I people thought I was nuts. You can't help but sing along to all of the songs even though they achieved such variety.Unfortunately this time around I don't find myself singing. I've listened to the CD 3 times and don't hear the fun and witty lyrics that I was looking for. The music is there, and it's good, it's just not what I had hoped for. It has some wierd trashy, random, musical, noise between the tracks which is there for me to fast forward through."
4,pretty good stuff,"this is a good CD by The Squirrel Nut Zippers. It combines hot jazz, western swing, torch songs, and also has elements of traditional music, dixieland, klezmer, and a bit of tango thrown in, to boot. The vocals at times sound a bit Billie Holliday-ish, and the arrangements are pretty good."
3,"Still the Zippers...but clearly not ""hot""","While the SNZ continue to produce the sound that made their album ""Hot"" so incredible, the overall effect on ""Perennial Favorites"" is lacking. Some great songs shine through, notably ""The Suits are Picking up the Bill,"" and ""Ghost of Stephen Foster."" But on certain tracks such as ""Pallin' with Al"" the band falls into the quagmire of trying to hard to be themselves. While this album is certainly worth a listen or two, it is not as good as ""Hot."""
2,fun music but cacophanous and lacking in cohesiveness,"Their newest CD does have the same fun and flair that marked their past albums, but this time the music is just inundated with too much muscial digressions from a clear and enduring melody. Some of the songs incorporated ska-like elements. The simpler tunes in Hot and Inevitable are much more enjoyable and not so harsh in integrating the all the instruments they use. And what a disappointment that Katherine Whalen's beautiful and unique ""Billy"" voice was only heard on a couple of songs, mostly the short ones! And Maxwell has to stop shouting (there's a song which poorly imitates the popular ""Hell""). All in all, quite different from the prior albums."
4,Less could have been more...,"I'm a huge fan of the Zippers, and think they are one of the best modern bands recording hot and Dixieland style jazz. However, I much prefer the minimalism of their second album, ""Hot,"" to the more cluttered sound of ""Perennial Favorites."" The recordings on ""Hot"" have a clear, less distored sound quality. Throughout this new album, the horns sound thin, the vocals fuzzy at times, and the bass is less well defined. Simply put, this third album has a lower sound quality overall.I was excited by the trend between the Zippers first and second albums; the sound quality and musicality improved greatly. With this third album, it seems they have taken a step back. In recommending the Zippers to new listeners, I will suggest the simpler, slower paced, more pleasant sound of ""Hot."""
3,"Better stuff than this, but still cool",I just started listening to new swing. I always listened to the 30-40's swing. When I heard about swing coming back I was ecstatic. I bought BBVD and I am convinced it is better than 99% of the songs back then. I heard about SNZ hoping the same result. Only The suits are picking up the bill and the ghost of steven foster are good. If there are other songs that you think sound good or you want to contact me: f8336@aol.com END
3,"Good, but not their best","Not bad, but it suffers in comparison with their previous dynamite releases ""Hot"" and ""The Inevitable"". If the lyrics of ""Trou Macacq"" are to be believed the Zippers now find themselves in the predictable rut that independent acts fall into when they find commercial success (and not just the lyrics -- the music itself is a reprise of their calypso number from Hot, ""Hell"").Still, there are moments that sound fresh. This isn't the place to start with the Zippers, but if you're already hooked, Perennial Favorites is worth a listen."
4,Practical and durable for travel,"The pack worked well as we traveled 3 weeks through Spain, France and Italy. The pack endured the Rail Europe, the city metros, countless taxi trunks, and cobblestone streets. The only issue we had with the pack is when the removable day-pack was connected to the main pack, it would tip over as the base was not wide enough to support this configuration."
3,A Disorganized Mess,"I consider myself very unfortunate to have to use this book in my introductory accounting class. I have no idea why the professor picked this particular book. The formulas and key concepts are scattered around and hard to find. There're many anecdotes throughout the book. I appreciate the effort to make the book less boring. But in essence this practice makes the book even harder to follow.I hope the book did a better job of outlining the contents and making things easy to find. At one point the book talked about ""amortization of intangible assets"" without bothering to even explain what that means, as if the readers are supposed to know.I'll give credit to the well structured problems in the book. There are many different kinds of practice problem sets that follow each chapter, and I thought the difficulty level of them are just right. This saved the book from 2 stars."
5,A Great Video for Young People,"As a music teacher, I am always looking for new things to use with my students. While I can give them all the names, dates and facts and let them listen to the music, it is a wonderful thing for them to be able to see it. It brings it all into perspective. My thanks to the creators of the HBO composers' specials and please, keep them coming!"
3,not much going on in this forest...,"I was looking for a CD to remind me of the country. Crickets, wolfs, deers...the sound of trees growing. Then, I remembered I've never been to the forest. So there you have it. This may or may not be the sounds of forestry. Maybe it's a petrified forest."
2,Silly,"This book was beyond frustrating. Jessica tries to ask about the planet's culture and what people do for a living and she is told ""we are men, not boys"". Then, of course, they have to have sex. When she asks Dylan and Jett's mothers questions, they bathe her. No one bothered to explain anything and it just seemed dumb. Jessica thinks about her mother wanting grandchildren a few times, but at the end she decides that sometimes you have to give up family and friends for a new life. I am sure her parents appreciated that. If I had not bought it for free, I would ask for my money back."
4,great rabbit cage,This cage is just right for our bunny. It's very easy to clean and was quick to put together.
3,"Eh, it's ok. I've had better.","Size is good, but make sure to get the urine guards for the corners (which by the way aren't the right size to fit completely), otherwise when your bunny backs into the corner to pee, it completely misses the tray. I love how it folds down easy for storage as well. I've had better cages, but they weren't the folding kind like this."
1,Nothing new here.,"I was very disappointed in the Perricone tapes. I listened to them twice and found it simplistic, and verbose."
1,half of this book was enough,"i loved diane johnson's other booksthis one i couldn't even finishalthough i lived through the period depicted, in today's world it seemed dated and irrelevanthalfway through i didnt know where the plot was going and didnt carei felt no sympathy for the characters who seemed to be in messes of their own making, although everything was so vague it was hard to tell what was going oni felt no sense of urgency or suspense about the storyhow this could have been a national book award finalist is beyond mei agree it was pretty awful"
1,WORST LANGUAGE LESSON EVER!,"The Standard Deviants talk down to their viewers and with the shaky camera and jumpy cuts it just gives you a headache! I tried to watch this and other Standard Deviant lessons, but always felt let down in the end. The jumpiness of the show is too distracting & is specially designed for people with absolutely NO attention span. IF YOU ARE SERIOUS ABOUT LEARNING FRENCH, DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR & WATCH FRENCH FILMS INSTEAD (or use French audio on favourite moves, listen to French cds, etc). Classic French language animation, like Asterix & Obelix, Tintin, and Lucky Luke will help you much more. I also recommend listening to Zazie CDs, she is great and always comes w/ lyrics (and she sings slowly enough for you to follow everything). She has at least 6 CDs out currently. Other singers I recommend...Edith Piaf, Les Charlots (funny band similar to The Monkeys), M, Air, etc. There are far more enjoyable ways of learning French!!"
2,Poor quality production,"Perhaps the DVD would've been easier to follow if it weren't for the poor production quality of the DVD. The colours are way off. First, I thought it had to do with the settings on my PC, but the DVD looks horrible (too much red) also on my new TV.The pronunciation of some of the French words is off, the scetches are cheesy and the graphics are poor and often incomplete.All in all, I wouldn't recommend these DVD-series. It's a shame I bought both the DVD's already."
4,pittodrie,"this thing is a blast.sesame street in french for some of us who never grow up.it's hard to rate this because I speak french so so,mainly grammar and tense errors.but this thing is a toy and I actually found out things I had forgotten.I would say this is more of a review than a learning tool.if you really want to learn french,I would suggest ""french in action""by capretz."
2,The Standard Deviants - Parlez-vous Francais?,"I have been trying to learn French for some time and have bought many CD and a few DVDs including this one. If you are one of those who would like to learn from native sounding speakers then this DVD is not for you. The accents especially the 'Rs' did sound right.Apart from this slight oversight which was enough to make me 'shelve' the disk, I thought the disk was entertaining."
3,"Sometimes clever, but not all that interesting","Does let you hear proper pronunciation and very simple conversations. I got it for myself and my sons, ages 12 and 7 (we had recently moved to France and were coming home for the summer and I was looking for something to keep us current) and it just didn't fill a niche for any of us. Maybe for older teenagers?"
3,Good Content - Poor delivery,"I purchased the DVD to bring with me to learn French while in France (unplanned extended trip). The content is more useful than the audio CD I purchased, however the delivery makes it very difficult to learn. The ""humor"" noted in other reviews is annoying, but could be overlooked if it were easy to rewind and review - but on a PC, viewing the DVD you cannot rewind in short segments as you can with a remote control/TV DVD setup. There is almost no repetion and the words flash across too quickly to absorb without rewinding. If you have the patience to rewind rewind rewind, there is useful information to be learned."
1,Awful Video,"The Standard Deviants usually make some interesting and educational videos. The French videos, however, are their worst. Not only do they breeze through topics at an unreal pace, most of the actors do not know French themselves! What a joke. Please, if you want to learn French, even the basics, look elsewhere."
4,Amusing review of French basics,"This DVD provides both parts I and II of the Standard Deviants' French series. I teach high school French, and my students find the videos engaging, entertaining, and informative. By its nature, this DVD cannot offer the depth necessary to supplant any real teaching (which isn't their purpose anyway); however, it does help remind students of some grammatical and lexical basics they learn in French I. The college-age actors (non-native speakers with some questionable pronunciations here and there but clear enough for their goal) are accessible to my teen students, but their acting is meant to be over-the-top (perhaps to counter boring professors' lectures at some universities). Note that this DVD is not for learning phrases for travel."
3,"It's Good for some ""basics"" as the title states","Overall it's decent and interesting to watch. I was actually hoping for more basic vocabulary and common phrases than all the grammar rules they are trying to teach. I just need more ""travel/tourist"" knowledge. So this seems better suited for someone actually trying to learn the French language for the long haul, not if you're traveling for a week. It's still interesting and slightly corny, but it makes it somewhat fun to watch."
4,Great Stuff,"I bought this tape as a review before a vacation to France and found it both usefull and enjoyable. Though I have never taken a French class, the tape, and the actors, were helpful for me in learning some key phrases. I also thought the skits and humor were very entertaining and made the whole process more fun than sitting through a class."
2,too much sex?,"Now the book was nicely put together i must admit, but while reading this book i found there were 12 sex scenes throughout. It was mainly Rodger and Rosamund, but the rest were alyce, edward, and rodger. Rodger and Rosamund couldn't even stand next to eachother without being sexually aroused. The scenes were also too detailed. There is no reason why there should be so many detailed sex scenes. It doesn't matter what your age is, no one needs to be reading that stuff. The more detailed it got, the less i believed they actually loved eachother. this book was just too much. i couldn't even enjoy the rest of the book from the fear of the next intimate scene. i like romantic books, but this was just over the top. defintely not for kids."
2,FINALLY FINISHED!,"This book was tedious. Maybe I kept on reading because the love scenes were so sexy - I don't know. The story seemed cobbled together, strung out on a version of English history. I became so tired of Rosamond with her ""love him - love him not"" attitude. One minute she was slavering over Rod, the next she was beating him with her fists. This heroine's personality, attitude and behavior were so inconsistent and shallow I could hardly wait to finish the book."
2,Romance? Naw.,"I guess maybe I'm old fashioned but this book started out okay and interesting to me but towards the end, I just skimmed through it just to finish it and put it aside. The vulgarity of the language of the characters really displeased me as dialog and the main characters going at it like rabbits didn't interest me either. There was a lot of repetition in the love scenes and actually, I wouldn't really refer to them as love scenes. I did not ""feel"" that Rosamond and Rodger actually loved each other. And what was with the constant ""desires"" every time he looked at her and the ""flame"" that would start in her belly? Did she suffer from constant heartburn? Come on, be a little more realistic. The historical aspects and insight were wonderful and it was nice to read a different type of battle scene as opposed to something you'd find in fantasy or science fiction novels. But for the ""romantic"" aspects of the tale, BAH!"
2,Good until the end,"I love the romance between Rod and Rosamund, but I cannot believe Virginia Henley killed off Simon De Montfort. I don't read romance novels so I can feel sad. Simon is one of the ultimate romance novel heros and to be killed off in such a hideous way really bummed me out. He is the kind that you don't kill off! I guess Henley didn't remember that Simon is the best War lord in all of Christendom. I know Simon is a side character in this novel, but I can't read the Pirate and the Pagan again without thinking of his death! :("
1,Oh The Horror!!!,"For any fledgling romance authors out there NEVER!!! I repeat, NEVER, kill off a hero from one of your previous books in a sequel. Especially when that hero is Simon DeMontfort. Yes, I know that he came to a terrible end in the accurate historic record, but this is romance Ms. Henley. Truly bad form.He is her best hero to date, and she will never top him. I was more caught up in his story here than Rosamund and Rodger.I have loved Virginia Henley's books since I was 12, and I thought she could do no wrong as an author. Even after A Woman of Passion, which lacked any true romance until the very end, and even that was ruined by the coniving of the heroine.I was sorely disappointed in this book. It ended the trilogy on a sour note."
1,"As the other reader said ""the horror""","I read ""the dragon and the jewel"" and love it, it was the best VH book i have ever read, then i read this book and saw that she killed off Simon DeMontfort, now i just cann't read that book anymore, not because i am a romantic but because I think readers buy book to entertain them and to kill off a character that is entertaining is ""horrible"". I know that history states that Simon DeMontfort dies and i understand Ms. Henley point of view but from a reader view point it not something i would like to see in fantasy!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,A Prize of a Book,"Not having read the prior books in this series, I was not prejudice to the death of Simon de Montfort. Then again, Simon was a real person in English History and he did die in the rebellion. Readers should keep this in mind. Virginia would not be true to history if she re-wrote it. The Marriage Prize is about Rosamond Marshal who has been betrothed to Rodger de Leyburn as a child. She is a marriage prize due to her dowery. Feeling that Rodger only wants her for her holdings, and not for love, she holds herself back after they are married. But Rodger arouses a passion in her that no other can. When Civil War breaks out she finds herself torn. Does she side with her husband or does she remain loyal to her guardians Simon and Eleanor de Montfort? A great read with a lot of historical facts, places, and people, as well as a wonderful and sensual romance that blooms for two strong people."
3,Not a happy girl,I liked the main characters Rodger and Rosemond in the beginning of the story but things just went bad when they became Simon's enemies. I have read many Virginia Henly books and I agree that Simon is her best hero ever. I know I am probably being unfair but I thought that Rodger was somewhat of a weasel. Especially when plotting at Simon's castle with Prince Edward. Rosemond was a pretty likable heroine but her acceptance of everything Rodger did was disappointing. Defintely not a feel good book.
5,"Read this book first before ""The Dragon and..."" and you'll love it.","You are more likely to rate this book a five star if you read this book prior to ""The Dragon and the Jewel"" (predecessor). The prequel's hero, Simon, dies in this sequel. Wars killed a lot of men and Simon was on the losing side of the war this time. The hero this time, Rodger, is so, so, perfect in many ways!I have read this book a couple of times because the love story stuck with me over time and prompted me to read it again."
2,disapointed,"Ilove Henleys books but I was upset with this one, I didn't like the fact that Simon and Eleanor were the bad people in this book when they were so strong in their book, and I think everyone loved them and to be grafic about his dealth.I couldn't read this one and the main characters were nothing impressive,I love all her books but was disapointed with this one and would of loved her to stop with the first two."
4,Interested and believe in Feng Shui Gardening.,"Have only glanced through the book, but looks to be some interestingstuff to contemplate. I have done Feng Shui gardening with much success."
1,Beyond Dreadful,"Thank God I have this only on VHS.. Not only is the story completely untrue and fanciful, but the script and acting are just plain awful. Save your money and do not waste it on a DVD. This is not even rent-worthy."
4,My daughter really enjoyed it,"It is a very good introduction of young kids to music and how people lived in Germany in the first half of XVIII century. My 9.5 years daughter really enjoyed it. It reminded her about story of Pilgrims coming to America.Although the story was probably fictional it was interesting since it had one main topic and a moral dilemma. Who should a person be loyal to and what is more important - loyalty or passion.I did not rate it with 5 stars since some parts of the movie were not consistent. In the beginning Bach is presented as an angry, almost violent man, then he is becoming a very understanding and even compromising, although he never compromises his music. Good action, nice costumes, I wish it was more factual and it talks more about Bach's music and his life in overall and less about a small boy who was so perfect and almost saved bach's freedom. But maybe this is a reason why children like it because they can identify with this small boy."
1,Botched Bach,"I bought this film based on the reviews and the price (it is inexpensive). However, the video is completely overtaken with a plot that has almost nothing to do with Bach and his life - other than his trials in seeking patronage.If you have an hour to kill, this video will do it for you."
1,Not the Bach I have come to know and love.,"""Live life with passion"" is the theme of this Bach biopic from Sony. The music and scenery are tremendous, yet some music is played at a time (1717-1719) before it was really composed. The serious student of Bach knows his life was driven by faith, doing all things to the glory of God. The ""passion"" here is nebulous. Some parts are interesting, but the main theme of the film loses the point."
1,Bach?,I thought that this movie was not good at all! It was really boring and had absolutely nothing to do with Bach! You could have put another composer in his place and it would not have changed the movie a little bit! The movie was dull and lifeless! In music class I had almost fallen asleep while I had watched this movie!!!! I thought this movie was very dissapointing! I do not reccomend it at all!
2,Not Excactly Learning Anything....,"This is one of the many ""educational"" movies that you only learn about one thing for an hour. It was not a very fun thing to watch, even though a kid was in the story. It's weird at alot of parts, not just the fact that Bach lived a long time ago. I don't really recommend this movie, only if you are a very big fan of Bach's work. You don't hear alot of his work in the movie, until a ""grand finale"" in the end. Altogether, this is mostly a true Bach fan's movie to watch."
5,Bach at his finest,"This was one of the deepest, and still educational, movies I have seen in a long time. I am a huge fan of Bach and I am pleased with this tormented and misunderstood portrayal of the man who is Bach. The soundtrack is excellent, the acting superior, and the story, though mostly fiction, is convincing and makes the movie that much more interesting."
2,Disappointing,"Although the CD covers a lot of Beethoven's music, the piano player in the first seven tracks is horrible. He or she keeps hitting the wrong notes. The tempo of the music overall is too fast and for some reason, they stopped ""Ode to Joy"" right in the middle. If you want a CD that features excellent musicians and Beethoven's music played the way it should be, don't buy this CD. Invest in the soundtrack from the movie, ""Immortal Beloved""."
4,"Buy this CD for the lovely music, but not for babys brain","There is lovely music on this CD. It's too bad that they had to package it under the pretense that it is somehow going to make your baby smarter. If this music helps you relax or creates a feeling of enjoyment then it is worth owning. The so called ""Mozart Effect"" collapses under scrutiny. Repeated efforts have been unable to reproduce most of it's effects. The ones that were reproduced only lasted for about 15 minutes after hearing the music. It was NEVER shown to have any effect what so ever on babies, it was tested on college students. If you are buying this CD to make your baby smarter I suggest buying a book and reading to them. If you are buying this CD to expose your baby to the rich culture of music, by all means....enjoy!"
2,Brainless Beethoven devaluation,"What do you get when you play brilliant music through a bad synthesizer? Buy this CD and find out. Your little prodigy's intellect will be engulfed in an annoying stream of cheap rinky-tink pianos, tooting synth-horns, and fake accordions. This is a cheap and annoying version of a great composer's work. Your young Einstein would be better off with a cheap harmonica."
2,Bad Music: Bad Science,"It has been disproven that Classical music does anything more or less for a baby's development than any other kind of music. This series builds off people's hopes/desires to build a better baby by simply playing a CD. If only life were that easy! What makes matters worse is that the quality of the music on these ""XXXXX for Babies"" series CD is uniformly bad.If you want to play Classical music for your baby, wonderful! But by all means go to the Classical Music section of Amazon and by the best possible recordings of the great composers and forget about these slick marketing gimmicks aimed a gullible (albiet lovingly so)parents-to-be."
2,"Why is everything geared to helping your kid ""compete""?","Classical music is beautiful and rewarding. Can't it be rewarding on its own terms, rather than as a ""fast track"" to the Ivy League and financial success? When I was a child, my parents played classical music for us because they loved it, and they hoped we would, too. I do the same for my own kids. But my siblings didn't much like classical music, and despite the insulting and ludicrous claims made on this CD, their SAT scores were in line with my own. I think that if Beethoven or Mozart knew that their beautiful, timeless music was being cheapened into just another ""get ahead quick"" scam, they'd roll over in their graves."
2,Beethoven good for babies?,I think Mozart is better for a baby's brain.Beethoven is too emotionally disturbing. Baby will grow up to be a manic-depressive.
5,WOW! GET THIS-->,"My baby was, like, really stupid so instead of messing around with the soft spot on the head, we put a big speaker in the crib and blast this stuff. now my baby's smarter than me! IT DOES MY FREAKIN' TAXES FOR CRYING OUT LOUD. Not only that, but now my baby publishes articles on theoretical physics! Stephen Hawking eat your heart out! Your baby heart, that is! HAHA!"
5,"Provides quick, concise info for ya librarians and teachers","A much-used title in our vocational high school library, every teacher who has checked it out wants their own copy. It has provided quick reference for the student who asks for the ""thin"" book--whether the book report is due tomorrow or the because the reader has difficulty with longer texts. I wish every young adult title came with this kind of information!"
3,Outdated and Debunked- Good for Historical Understanding,"This is a seminal work in the study of the crowd and collective action, but be sure to note that Le Bon's work has been roundly dumped, at least in the field of psychology. Le Bon wrote from the perspective that the crowd is a gathering of people behaving animalistically; this may make intuitive sense, but it fails to identify or explain key crowd characteristics, such as who participates and who doesn't. Collective action research has advanced far beyond Le Bon's conceptualization, but his work is still influential. Plus, the best way to understand contemporary theory is to understand the theories before it and their inadequacies. So, a good read, but keep it in perspective. Later research has demonstrated that Le Bon's work, while certainly important, is woefully inadequate."
4,Relevant Today,Written from a time when men still used critical thinking skills. As someone who has worked in the mental health services I found Le Bon's conclusions spot on on the mindset of men & women who no longer find the status quo to be as static as they think it is. Transfer the same set of circumstances to modern america & the affect will b the same- when pushed too far the PEOPLE will push back.
3,Too Expensive,"I have below the waist length hair and while Bumble and Bumble Curl Conscious makes it feely soft and provides curl, I have found other curl shampoos sold in the drug/grocery store to be of equal quality, if not superior quality."
3,Sturdy metal slicer with plastic housing,"Sturdier than products I've seen in stores, this slicer is a good addition to the kitchen. Good for making egg salad and for creating chunks of egg or mushroom to be added to salads and as garnish on veggie dishes.Because the space between slicing wires is quite wide, I suggest you make three cuts instead of the usual two when making egg salad with this slicer. For mushrooms, the slices are good for most dishes. Thought it's possible to slice a portabella mushroom, you have to pre-cut to fit the slicer, minimizing its usefulness.Good in the dishwasher, strong and will last quite a long while. I'm happy I got it."
4,Excellent book on visual design,"This book describes how the Bauhaus/Itten principles of visual design can be applied to photography. If you are technically competent, but lack composition skills, you will find this book very useful."
4,Well pleased with The World around you!,"One of my favorite books, this one is totally different to what I was used to get when reading a book on photography. Mr. Patterson gives you his approach and what inspired him to take each one of the photos in the book. The topics covered are what I was interested in. I can say that I am very pleased with this book.This is an excellent book and highly recommended for the topics covered."
5,Inspirational,It was quite interesting to learn exactly why the photographs in this book were taken. The techniques were clever and well explained. Highly recommended.
2,Lastest edition.,"As compared with the earlier edition, unfortunately there is very little that is new here. Also, as is true in the earlier edition, there are not enough visual examples of either the building blocks or the arrangements. For the very useful basis ideas, buy a used copy of an earlier edition."
4,"Rich, crisp & raw...","This is one of the hard-to-find CD in the market today. The group made waves in the late 80' & early 90's. I first watched their MTV Unplugged concert video before I started a hunt-and-search of this CD. Finally, I found this CD here in Amazon. It's a very rich album although the last few songs are edited tracks removing the vocals which is still great if you know the lyrics and sing-along with it while on a long drive. Also, the group made a very great rendition of an old song ""Everyday People"". Mr. Wendell is very crisp and upbeat in nature. It's one of the best old school RnB album you can find in any CD store today. Just plain acoustic!"
2,Worst French language book.,"I have taken 2 French classes and they both used this book. One of the authors is a professor at my university which is why it is required. I found it to be both dull and uninformative. Also, the movie that accompanies the book is very cheesy and dated (in my opinion)."
3,There are better books out there,"I used this book in introductory French. It is tied directly to a movie that is supposedly about French culture...the movie is soap opera and does not help you learn any more French than would interactive classroom activities and real French cinema. The movie is supposed to detail diversity in French; however, a trip to Maroc is as diverse as it gets. My guess is that the authors didn't want to expose intro students to the real facts behind French colonialism and why it is a global language."
1,Hard-core fans only,"This cd is for hard-core EZN fans like me who just wanna have everything the band has done. This is a really poorly recorded show which was billed as the REUNION of EZN. Well, it was Donnie Vie, Derek Frigo, & Vik Foxx, but Chip Z'Nuff was not there, so the bassist is just some random dude.I will warn you now, the sound quality is bad, as it was pieced together from different sources. If you can get past the horrible audio quality, it is interesting to hear the final EZN performance of Derek Frigo, who died a short while after this gig."
5,Increiblemente Original!,"Soy Fan de Belanova desde el primer CD Cocktail, me parece uno de los pocos grupos mexicanos con talento y con una formula que no cae en el tipico cliché pop latino, les recomiendo a todos los fanaticos del house que le den una oportunidad no quedaran descepcionados!"
2,This Royal Watcher Doesn't Love It. . .,"I first read this book when it came out in 1984 and enjoyed it; I was in my thirties. Now, in my fifties and with a lot more biographies under my belt, I ordered another copy. What a disappointment! It's what nostalgia can do to one's memory. This is what I call a 'light' biography. By that I mean there is much, much interpretation on the part of the author--what the subject was thinking at particular times, what she said or was told. Of course, there is no way for Ms. Edwards to know that. She is adding her own spin--by today's lingo--to history. By the time I was to the end of this book I had been force-fed Mary's ""majesty"" and ""majestic bearing"" so much I was anticipating a royal beheading!For those who don't read many biographies, or who remain more interested in the interpreted interplay of personalities, this book might satisfy. For those interested in more accuracy and less artistic interpolation, there are better, particularly Pope's."
1,An abomination,"Some good info buried beneath a mountain of poor organization, archaic references, and unexplained concepts. Don't buy it."
3,Info scarce for my family,"I only found 4 mentions of the family members who I am researching. This book was not worth the price for my research. Hopefully, other families can have more success."
4,Decent Little Fizzlers,"These smell very nice and work pretty well; I like the smaller size, the scent is not overwhelming. These are a good quality and very relaxing; good product for the price. I only gave it 4 stars because the fizz time is extremely short; I dropped these in the water, turned around to get something, came right back and they were done. I suppose that's to be expected from the smaller size but still. Other than that, there were wonderful!"
1,This is a stinker...,"I usually like movies from the 30s, but this one was pretty bad. The acting and sets were awful, high school kids could have done better, don't waste your time or money."
4,his best since doggystyle!,"snoop is back. after the masterpieces of doggystyle and the chronic, snoop wondered between bad albums and mediocre ones, without really fullfiling his amazing potential. last year we watched him return strongly on dre's ""chronic 2001"" and now the comeback is complited with a brilliant, rich cd. tracks like ""henecy n budha"" , ""go away"", ""issues"", and many more, pruduced by giants like dre, timbaland and others, are by no doudt some of snoop's best work. why only 4 stars then? well , the lyrics ain't so good on many track, and the talented cokane is overused (overdose of cokane so too speak...). all in all this cd is so much fun, any dre & snoop lover can't miss this!"
5,put it in the air!!,"definitely snoops best album since doggystyle. timbaland, dre, soopafly, battlecat, laid down some tight a$$ beats. leave me alone might be the tighest song on this album, and one of the tightest songs hes ever done. who knew snoopy could sing, and sound that good? this album is hot and if youre sleeping on snoop cause of a couple of his last albums, youre making a mistake."
3,Not A Real Meal,"I Love Snoop D-O Double G Since Death Row but this new disc doesn,t stay true to the G Funk Style. Some of the cuts Do Like Tracks: 2,3,7,9, and 15. But the majority of the CD strays away from G Funk to more Pop Sounding Music. I got the Death row Cd Dead Man Walking its also not his best material but its more closer To G Funk than Tha Last Meal is. Im not fully satified with this meal."
2,SNOOP YOU COULD HAVE DONE ALOT BETTER,"THIS ALBUM SUCKS THE BEATS ARE NOT REALLY GOOD AND THE LYRICS ISN'T HOT, BUT SNOOP IS STILL THE MAN."
1,HORRIBLE AND STUPID CD.,This is probably his all time worst album ever.The production is very bad and snoops lyrics are very stupid.Just another excuse to make money off of simple minded wannabe gangsters....
2,Disapointing,I am a huge Snoop fan but I have to say that I found this album to be somewhat lackluster. The beats sound the same on almost all the tracks and Snoop over uses his partner Kokane (I think he is on every song). The album has one or two good songs but as a whole Snoop is capable of so much more.
2,could have been better,"I'm givin this two stars cuz I'm a big snoop fan, but frankly this album is .... Top Dogg was better than this.Doggystyle is one of the best rap albums ever. This is not even close to anything on that album.A few joints were okay, but he is outshined (mercilessly) by Ice Cube, MC Ren, Bad Azz, etc. It would have been better if some of Snoop's deathrow pals featured on here, like Dre, Daz, Kurupt or even Lady Of Rage. In my opinion, Snoop is only still making albums because of Doggystyle. This album is terrible, and not what we have come to expect of Snoop. I hope his next one is better"
4,Solid Effort,"A solid Snoop album. Production includes Dr. Dre, Timbaland, Jelly Roll, Meech Wells, Scott Storch, Soopafly, and others. Guest appearances include Kokane, Eve, Ice Cube, Nate Dogg, Master P, and more."
1,wots happened to snoop,"I stole this CD off my ""mate"" and I wish i hadn't. There are 6 songs worth listening to. All but 2 are only good because they feature other good rappers eg set it off, lay low, back up off me and there are 3 other songs that are good hennesey n buddah, i cant swim and y'all gone miss me. Whats happened to you Snoop."
2,GET IT STRAIGHT SNOOP ISNT HIPHOP,"snoops new one is ok its nothing to be impressed by. its better than dead man walking, the game is to be sold, and doggfather, but if you want real snoop go get doggystyle, thats ill. but snoop is not hiphop he is gangster rap, hiphop is real, like pharcyde, and hieroglyphics, now thats hip hop, snoop repeats himself so much as it is, but i wouldnt recommend it, you can buy this one if you bought all the good cds already. than buy it. Definently not a must have. peace"
4,Aww yeah..,"Snoop is just the king of the West Coast these days, along with his Super Cuz Daz of course. These two cats from the big LBC are the tightest rappers of our day. I wasn't feelin R&G half as much as I felt this one and Tha Doggfather. Picc this one up my cousins, it's a straight banger. If you already have it, and every Daz CD, as these two cats are the tightest folks from the West Coast, go get a Mr. Doctor CD, cuz he's still underground and needs your support. West coast craccin folks."
5,Best Raps Since Death Row,"This CD is great. Snoop jam packs it with tight...beats, lucrative lyrics, and a laid back style. Snoop Dogg hasn't put out anything better, not even Doggystyle can match with this CD. Buy this CD, the tracks wont let you down, and it's bound to be one of the greats of rap"
3,needs to be recooked,"not snoop's best effort he still has yet to top doggystyle. the lyrics are tight as hell, the beats lack puppy power unfortunately, rage, ice cube, mc ren outshine snoop on set it off.kokane even outshines snoop, like i said the beats [stink] i can't swin was a poor effort to captrure the parliament vibe, and one more thing timbaland sounds out of place.snoop call ant banks, dj quik, or crazy toones."
4,cool,i like this album alot in my opinion lay low is da bomb tons of swearing if u like swearing buy it snoop dogg rulez peace
4,2 bad songs make it a four,"Overall tighe but true lies and brake fluid shouldn't be on there. The best songs are issues, stacey adams, lay low, back off me, and set it off."
5,snoop dogg in da house,"this is snoop's greatest cd yet. it is definitely 5 star material. listen to ""lay low"" and ""snoop dogg"". those songs are hot. so if your lookin for an awesome rap cd, this is he cd you want to get."
2,2.5 at the best,"This record has a lot of weak songs on there mixed in with a few good ones. Snoop just this record out just so he could get out of his NO Limit record contract, so thats why im thinkin he rushed this. All the beats are pretty weak, but he has a few good people on the mic wit him. If you love snoop doggs music like i do you gotta pick it up, but if you dont really feel some of his good cd's like Doggystyle and Top Dogg, then this cd isnt for you."
5,Hes Back,Snoops no limit stuff was ok you know like 3 star stuff but this one proves that the dogfather is back and here to stay i think this is a definite but. People say he fell off but hes back and better then ever!
3,I was surprized!,"Every album after doggy style was garbage to me. Well, except Topp Dogg witch was stright. This album I think is pretty close to Doggy style. I has a lot of songs. Many of the snoop fans would be proud but many of the snoop haters would be haten, I dont hate by the way. But this album is steel good!"
4,4 Stars and much more,"I just have bought this album and I was thinkin' ""Damn, another da game is to be sold"" AAAAAAAARGH! None of that!! The names of Dre, Nate Dogg, Eastsidaz don't mean nothin' to you: production=quality. ANd Snoop is usually tremendous on the mic. This is for all ya that thought that the West is dead. F y'all!"
4,THE RETURN OF THA G!!!,"This is snoop's best album since Doggystyle, without a doubt. This is snoop like we all like him before he went downhill with the no limit label. There are tons of guests here, including Kokane (who is on way too many tracks), Nate, MC Ren, Ice Cube, Eve, Master P, Bad Azz, etc. Best tracks are Lay Low, Hennessy N Buddah, Set It Off, Back Up Off Me, Leave Me Alone. The only reason it isnt just as good as Doggystyle is because it has a few weak songs that just get boring. If youre a snoop fan you will love it.overall, a very impressive album and snoop's best in years. well worth the $. COP IT NOW"
1,What an awful CD,"I'm a diehard rap fan (and used to love Snoop) but the guy has completely fallen off. Imagine if this was his first CD instead of Doggystyle-- we wouldn't even have heard of him! Unlike Tupac Shakur who got stronger lyrically and sylistically on each CD, Snoop has gotten worse and worse. I wish I had the money back I spent on this unlistenable horse excrement."
4,Snoop or poop?,"Snoop Dogg has writen an amazing amount of albums since he started his hip hop career, as a teenager. This is one of his best! It may cause offence, but however, if youre one of those sad ******* that take everything serious, it would ofend ya. Take my advice and buy it till it's gone, because his other albums such as 'doggfather' wont get better then this stuff! Trust me, INNIT!"
3,slightly better than average,"Slightly better than average describes this album well, I think. As a fan of Snoop Dogg, I have always admired his attitude and unique lyrics. He doesn't disappoint in this release, and while there are some quite creative tracks featured, I still find myself regularly listening to only about five of the them. This album varies greatly in the quality of the songs(in terms of originality, etc.), from the rythmic and smooth(""Lay Low"", ""Snoop Dogg"") to the rather disappointing and dull(""Bring It On"", for one). While this record certainly has its share of good tracks, some of the cuts just don't do much for me. Nevertheless, Snoop himself is still doin' his thing, and he does it well enough to keep me listening and giving him decent reviews."
2,Really disapointed!!!!,"I'm a big Snoop Dogg fan since Dre introduced him to this game and I've got all his cd's except dead man walkin which I'll purchase later.The thing is, I listened 13 songs so far and, unfortunatelly, only 3 or 4 are really dope!! and that guy Kokane is really annoying...he tries to sound like the father of funk George Clinton but he don't have Clinton's talent and he appeared in almost half of this album!!!!!At least he off of no limit, I hope he can do a better job in his own label..this cd is wack!!!"
3,"So much hype, so much hope, so much disappointment","What happened? I had some much hope for this album but came off seriously disappointed. Albeit Snoop comes out swingin' with the classic flow that's made him a star, I just can't get A: Production efforts by Dr. Dre. I'm not impressed. B: the constant, unheard of amount of tracks featuring Kokane, the hook-singing, note-cracking, gets-in-your-head-and-makes-you-F-ing-crazy rapper. Any song featuring him would be all the more better without.While Tha Last Meal failed to impress, there were some bangin' tracks that I really actually like. The album's finest, ""Set It Off"" features The gloriously glorious MC Ren, the lyrical murder Lady of Rage, Rap's damned finest hook-singer Nate Dogg, and Ice Cube. Timbaland supplies an always fresh, bangin' production for this track. Other tracks like ""Lay Low"" and ""Ready to Ride"" supply well."
3,"Fun For Collectors, But Not a Lasting Album","Although I love Miles Davis, I think this album isn't going to stick with me, so to speak. It's upbeat, quick, and fun at first, but it lacks the complexity and feeling of the great Davis albums like KIND OF BLUE and 'ROUND ABOUT MIDNIGHT. I may be just a musical philistine, but I think one of the things that turns me off of the album is the vibraphone. Add to this that the album's pretty short; if they had some alternate takes or bonus tracks it might be interesting, but at this point it's a little thin. I will say that the final track, ""Changes,"" is the best track on the album and probably worth buying by itself as an MP3. So, with the final verdict on this album being something like a ""meh,"" I say: ""Take it from the Neophyte. Decide for yourself."""
2,Disappointing to Miles fan,"You'll find better works out there, particularly if you're a Miles fan. The emphasis here is on Milt Jackson and his vibraphone, which gives the album a light, airy feeling. Missing is much of Miles' horn and sentiment. You also get a bit shortchanged with a mere 30 minutes of music. I would call this a ""pleasant"" album, which in my jazz-world is not a happy thing."
5,This is a good book.,"I read lots of these books. I have read most of Neal Stephenson's, Bruce Sterling's, and William Gibson's novels. This is a good book if you have interests in this area. The people who gave bad reviews are just not smart enough to understand the book's content, if they even finished reading it."
1,After a month-still waiting. From the picture it still looks good though.,I would love to reveiew the product. I purchased through Generation Orange over a month ago and I still have not received it. After I complained they finally wrote to me to let me know there was a problem at the plant and I should have my stroller with in 3 weeks and they would give me 15% off. So...still waiting. Over all disapointed.
2,Connie,DO NOT BUY THIS STROLLER!!! The seats are horrible!! The seats are just a metal tubular frame with fabric sewn around them and they are very short in height. In other words your child doesn't have to be very big before they would be hitting their head on the frame of the seat. My twins were only 2 months old when I purchased this stroller and they were 22 inches long and their heads were just a few inches from hitting the seat frame!! I returned this stroller.
2,Don't Buy This,"I bought this stroller and attempted to use it but one of the wheels kept going flat every morning. I had to order another inner tube. Then on the third day of trying to use this stroller, the front wheel completely bent. What a piece of garbage. I only had one child in the stroller and the wheel was fastened correctly and all I was doing was trying to push the stroller up a small curb. The other thing I didn't like about this stroller is that there is nowhere to hang/put a diaper bag. I sent this stroller back and bought a MacLaren double stroller."
4,Schwinn Free Wheeler Review,"Schwinn Free Wheeler 2 Double Swivel Wheel Jogging StrollerMy wife loves this stroller. She can put our 3 year old and 10 month old in it and go on walks. It is very smooth and easy to push.However, I am not as thrilled with this stroller. It is bulky, doesn't break down that well, and doesn't fit into places very well. I imagine that these problems occur for strollers like this one. In addition, one of the spokes on the rear wheel broke off and I need to get that repaired."
4,"So far, so good","I spent hours researching strollers before purchasing this one. And, although I think the more expensive versions might offer a stronger quality, this one suffices for the price. I actually like this stroller a lot! I just brought it to the mall for the first time and had no difficulties with it fitting in stores. It is super smooth when running and also folds up easily enough. The couple of things that I don't care for are the construction of the basket below - it seems just a little flimsy; however, it does hold my diaper bag and small drink cooler, in which I didn't think it would. Also, although I love the size of the sun canopy (this one of the main reasons I bought this stroller), this too seems a little flimsy. But, again, for the price comparison to others, I really am happy with my purchase and would recommend this to others.Good luck!"
3,Great for walking not for running,I love this stroller it worked great until I started to jog with it the only downfall is the back wheels they wobble at a fast walk or jog. It makes it feel unsafe and is hard to controil.
5,Great stroller!,"We bought this stroller for our 2 sons - 6 months and 3.5.... it has been a great purchase. We did find that the sunshade fell sometimes, but I simply tightened the bolt and it hasn't done it since. I, too, put a small pillow under my older son's head to help him from feeling too reclined. I found it very easy to assemble. I love the huge adjustable sunshade, the pivoting handle for me to push, the cushey seats for the boys, and the ease of pushing this stroller. I don't think it is for the avid jogger (as it has a pivoting front wheel and lacks the handbrake) - it is perfect for our long walks. I read all the reviews before I bought this one - and found them all to be accurate and helpful!"
5,SOoooooo worth the money,"I was skeptical about purchasing the stroller without testing it in the store first. I read all the comments and thought i'll purchase and send it back if we're unhappy with it. My husband put it together in no time. It folds down very easily and same with getting it out and up. My 2 year twins absolutely LOVE their ""buggy"". We were given a Maclaren when the babies were born, but I wish we had the buggy before hand. Oh and the swivel wheel is the best!"
1,UNHAPPY!!,"We purchased this stroller and it was not good. Before we finished asembling it we found that a part came broken. The same day we got it, we returned it. I am serious. I'm very picky, but this is a rip off. We were so excited to have this stroller, too good to be true. my husband and i spent months trying to decide, yet still we choose a bad one.(what i liked) Big sun shade, Rain Guard.(what i did'nt like) At the back of the sun visor big gap,so if it rains your child will be soaking wet from behind, no hand brake,tether has no adjustment, they sew it together, the bar for the legs will definetly stop blood flow in your kids legs. The material for the sun shade was really, really cheap."
4,Our 3 yr old and 9 month old love it! Safe and Sturdy!,"We did alot of research before buying this jogger and we have been very happy with it. I was scared because I read alot of reviews that their toddler age 3 plus kids legs were hanging down and they were not comfortable in many of the joggers we looked at. I have a tall 3 yr old and a 9 month old and they both ride in this very comfortably and my 3 yr olds legs still have lots of room, we will be able to use this I think for several more years! It is very strong and sturdy and works great! There is not a snack tray but a place behind the seat and under the seat to store things so that works out fine. The carrier underneith is fine, some review said it was really small, but we think it is fine, I can fit my diaper bag down there if we go to the zoo or something. We love it! And it fits through doors just fine at the store too! They did their research with this jogger, it is great in the store and on the road!"
4,good stroller,"Having tried different strollers for all different events, this stroller has been the best for us. I love this stroller. The kids do sit at a funny angle, but it doesn't seem to bother them in the least. They can almost lay flat and they sit up and see out which is their favorite feature. Most important the twins really like this stroller best of all. We like the swivel wheel, but keep it locked in place most of the time. Easy to collapse and pick up. Favorite feature as parents is the large canope. It keeps the sun off them most of the day. By far has been the best purchase we have made and the price was a definite plus."
4,"Great stroller, poor canopy","The stroller is fantastic - it drives like a dream, I can litteraly turn it with one finger! My only complaint is the sun canopy, my husband put his fleece on there and it caused the plastic piece to break. Once it breaks, it can't be fixed, it has to be replaced."
3,Ok stroller,"The front wheel wobbles some of time which is quite frustrating, otherwise a decent stroller for the money."
5,Schwinn Free Wheeler 2,"This is a great stroller. I get LOTS of inquiries about this when I am out and about. It's VERY easy to push and maneuver. I love the swivel front wheel, and I use the lock mechanism for walks/jogs. I would really like to see a hand brake, but the wrist strap on this model is definitely helpful for hills and rollerblading. The seats are easy to adjust, great pockets and cup holder. The sun shade is upgraded to a curve, which is really great. It's a little bit tough to collapse, but not too bad. It fits into the back of my minivan fairly well. GREAT value for the price, and it's definitely a step up from the regular model."
4,double stroller,fits my 2.5 yr. old and 6 mth. old fine and rolls with ease. The only issue I have is difficulty in folding it and adjusting the seat backs.Otherwise it just fits through most retail doors and allows me to run errands in the city with the kids in the stroller.
5,great bargain!,"I've already put many miles on my stroller in the month I've had it because my baby and three-year-old both love it. I'm so happy with the way it handles turns and bumps in the sidewalks, and with the way it folds up so easily. It also comes with great amenities, like the key holder and rain cover that make me feel like I definitely got my money's worth!"
2,Poor design...,"Can't really recommend this.It is great for my infant, but my 2 year old really -really- hates it. The seat is too deep and even with towels behind him he is so uncomfortable. He usually winds up indian-style.Maybe a much older kid would actually fit, but they'd probably rather walk at that age.I really wish I could return it purely for the poor seat design!!"
5,Smooth Ride!,"My oldest bot is tall like a 3 year old. Lots of leg room, head room, & space to move around in his seat.My youngest is 2 months (put in the body support & place him in the seat) he seems to enjoy it better then a car seat (gentle on his head & body when taking a walk around the park :)Easy to assemble, smoother then a bike ride, very light weight up hills (feels like you are pushing nothing at all :)..) You Should Get One :)"
4,Nice stroller. Excellent customer service experience from Manufacturer,"Great double-stroller, especially at the $220 price point. Only complaint is that the canvas material is a little thin (on the cover and underneath storage).Impressive 5-year warranty, which I actually utilized in the first couple weeks of use. One of the back wheels had a slightly loose spoke, which created a soft (but annoying) clanging noise. I went on the manufacturers website, clicked on the ""Contact US"" link and described the issue. Someone contacted me via email within 20 minutes, and after a quick follow-up question, they said a new wheel would be shipped to my home free of charge. It arrived within 2 days. That is very impressive."
4,"""Eskimo Blue Day"" Clarification","To clarify something from another review, the Jefferson Airplane song ""Eskimo Blue Day"" was never part of GO RIDE THE MUSIC. It was part of A NIGHT AT THE FAMILY DOG, and is included on the DVD release of that, along with the Airplane doing ""The Ballad of You & Me & Pooneil."" The old vinyl bootleg called UP AGAINST THE WALL MOTHER F... consisted of the 2 JA tracks from A NIGHT AT THE FAMILY DOG combined with the 7 JA tracks from GO RIDE THE MUSIC."
5,The 60's come to life again,"I grew up in the sixties, so reliving those times and hearing these great groups brought back a lot of memories, Jefferson Airplane, Quicksilver Messenger Band , and others. I wish there had been more footage of the other groups this dvd mentions, but it was well worth the money."
1,Poor Quality Feeder,We ordered two of these Best-1 72 OZ hummingbird feeder on June 3rd and have used them for 2 months. They are leaking due to stress cracks at the top of the bottle where the hanging mount is attached to the bottle. These feeders were not built strong enough and thus are very poor quality. Order a different brand and do not waste your money on these feeders. It is too bad large feeders are hard to come by.Troy
1,What were the designers thinking!,"This hummingbird feeder has to be set into the opening of my garbage disposer to sit upright to be stable enough to fill, and the small needs a funnel to fill the feeder. The base is easy to wash, but the top with its small opening is impossible to wash."
3,Best-1 Hummer feeder,"This feeder definitely requires less filling which I appreciate since our other hummer feeders all need refilling twice daily. However there is one drawback- I have yet to figure out the secret to cleaning this bottle! The mouth of the bottle is SO small; it's virtually impossible to reach in to clean. I have also noticed after the 3rd refill, the bottle leaks a little at the mouth- no matter how tightly one screws it in, and this attracts bees. So all in all, I have to give it 3 stars, but love the capacity it holds."
5,Can't live without it,"I have 10 of these and fill 3 to 4 a day. I go through over 50 lbs. of sugar a month. To clean them I bought a brush on Amazon http://www.amazon.com/BOTTLE-BRUSH-TUFTED-END-Each/dp/B004H9CELS/ref=sr_1_40?s=industrial&ie=UTF8&qid=1341703336&sr=1-40&keywords=bottle+brush. The brush is hinged in the middle and does a great job. There are also ant stoppers you can buy or put a sponge where you hang it with ant repellent on it. No way I know of to stop bees and wasps except for having fun with a hose or swatter. The older models had bad plastic that would not hold up to the sun and get brittle, I think the new models are better, maybe more UV protection and thicker, at least I have not had any problems for some time. When I got these feeders the hummers quit the little fancy ones. I have one I drilled 8 more holes in and when these little guys are hungry they will crowd right in there. I love these feeders."

4,The Music of Italy - everyone can enjoy,"This is a great value CD. The songs range from the old familiar classics - ""Arrivaderci Roma"", ""Volare"", to the updated version of ""Parlami D'amore Mariu"" and the make you want to get up & dance - ""Gloria"" the Italian version of the Gloria Branigan hit. Put the CD on, pour the Red Wine, & have a great time!"
2,enhancer,"I can see a small improvement, or maybe I really would like to see an improvement. It feels as if my breast have filled in some, after breastfeeding 3 babies and being over 40 I need all the help I can get."
3,Old and dated,This book has some good information but was in its prime in the 70's. Golf equipment and materials have changed so much in the last 10 years that the wooden drivers and crude cast irons in this book aren't too relevant to modern equipment. The theory discussed in the book is good but dated.
3,"lots of info , but you need a Phd to pu it to good use.","it was a dry read with many ""big"" words,. I think that with someone who understand it, it would be a great help."
4,Why Haven't More Heard This?,"The only reason I am writing this review is because I was hoping that there would be more than 2 reviews. This CD is the ultimate party CD - pop this in to a CD player at any party, let it roll, and everyone in the room will either laugh or dance at least once to each song. Okay, well, while some of the tracks in the middle aren't as high quality as the first few or the last few, it's still a strong listen. Marc Stretch is solid, and Prozack is unreal. DJ Design holds his own, and while he's still in the Peanut Butter Wolf vein, he has his own sound of hip hop, jazzy yet new age, classic, but party bumpin' fun. Please, check this out, along with Prozack Turner's solo efford, Death, Taxes, and Prozack (one of the greatest hiphop CDs you can find)."
2,Not really my thing,"this album was hyped up by one of my friends and I simply listened to it twice and never again. My favorite song, or the song I didn't mind listening to was ""Roomate Joint"" but the rest to me was pointless. I would not waste my time on this group, but then again my taste is quite different than what they do."
2,Soundtrack Delay - Great movie,"This is a GREAT movie but it seems like I got a defective copy because towards the end of the movie, the soundtrack is not in sync with the movie -- you see them speaking, but then you have to wait a few seconds for the sound to kick in. VERY annoying."
5,Girl night,Fantastic to search buy and hit play. Great movie book is better. No problems viewing movie. Less expensive then on demand.
4,Dennis Wilson as seen through friendly eyes,"I consider myself a true fan of the Beach Boys (yes, this species exists in Switzerland)and I've read a couple of books on the subject. If you are not very familiar with the story of the group and the background of the Wilson family, this book is NOT for you. It is rather a collection of articles, views (and reviews) of people close to Dennis Wilson, including even his children. The author clearly expects the reader to know the background, since not even a brief biography is included. But if you DO know your Beach Boys, this book is great. Rare pictures I haven't seen anywhere else and very personal stories about Dennis. The man deserved this book. However, since good reading about DW is scarce, a little bit more background on Dennis history would have been a nice addition. Ok, and now I'm gonna listen to Pacific Ocean Blue and think once more about what he could have accomplished, if he was still alive."
2,"good, but could have been better put together","This books is basically a collection of tributes and remembrances and even some obscure interviews, though a bio or timeline of some sort would have probably been helpful to readers. There are many good photos but are all black and white (and few are dated as a point of reference) The author's list of features on the back cover claims ""*Color pop-art designs by the artist/author"" I found these to simply be photo-manipulations and they were not in color. I was glad that someone created a tribute to Dennis whom I met several times, but was a little disapointed with the quality of the book on a whole for the price (...)."
4,Know What you are ordering,Purchased this with other products of this author.I am experienced in this field and thought these were professional and safe products to use. They work for me!
1,CD IS Fine - Download Wasn't,Ocean WavesI thought I was ourchasing an item that could be downloaded directly. I was very disappointed that the download ended up on the Amazon Cloud.
3,"It's cute, but a little clumsy.","I bought this for my son who is learning to count. He loves that it has little houses for the balls to roll into. However, the balls get stuck at the two ends and then once we loosen them they roll too easily side to side. So it's hard to get a hold of them with the very small magnet in the end of the pen before they stick at one end again. We can still use the number line, and my son likes to hold the pen and pretend to write with it. So we can use it that way, but the magnet feature of it is just too clumsy to really use."
3,Pop-garage from France,"It was a pretty garage-pop female band from France in the middle '80.""Toutes les nuites"" is a superb garage-punk song, the rest is a pretrty garage-pop."
1,Down With Down With Love,"I am the type of person who likes to read the book before the movie, because the book is usually better. Not in this case. Though there is still hope for the movie, the novel Down With Love is a hack publicity stunt. I thought that the movie would be based on the book, but failed to read the fine print at the bottom of the front cover ""based on the screenplay"". I have to admit that I did not read the entire thing, because I could actually feel it bring down my intelligence level. The vocabulary used in what I did read was more ""hooked on phonix"" than anything else. The constant references to the actual novel also irritated me with sentences like ""We interrupt the book to tell you my side of the story"". My advice: Up with the movie, down with the book""."
2,Its not good....but ive seen worse,"Got it for 4 bucks...and its still too much. What we have here is acompany called Asylum spouting out movie after movie and most of themare bad.In this one we have high school actresses and actors who are dressed upfor holloween and think they can deliver a movie...think again. Someof the acting (main character) is passable, but my 4 bucks went forthe special effects.And please tell me why most of the humans are young and pretty and why real actors/actresses did'nt bother to show up for this movie ...probablythe studio could'nt afford the real stuff..So they messed up another movie....Gee another coaster."
3,the greatest bad movie ever,"think of ten things in your mind that makes a movie great. this movie would fail all of them. that being said, there was something about it that i could not let go. it might have been the amount of beer in my system at the time but the music helped me through it to the point where i started to care about the characters.the reason i settled on 3 stars is the fact that this movie actually tried to be good. you can tell there was effort but no money backing it. for that it deserves the greatest bad movie i have seen in a long time title."
4,Does well as NEWEST robot flick to entertain !,"TRANSMORPHERSTheasylum.ccStarring: Matthew Wolf,Shaley Scott and Sarah Hall.A Leigh Scott filmSpecial Effects: Synapse FXWithout seeing that other big-budget robot film,This looks a lot like Starship troopers.The costumes are great, So are the sets from T2(`nuff said) and the special effects just plain work, Ya'all!Matthew Wolf IS the movie, Embodies: Hero/and surprising character development.Shaley Scott is very cat-like and gets all the cute macho lines.Sarah Hall delivers a journeyman performance, That rivals her `Hitchiker` film role.The menacing robots are stronger in depiction than Theasylum has shown it's monsters in the past, Seems given more time than can rival ANY effort that has a bigger budget.Thanks from your fans, This film will turn a corner to acceptance on video shelf."
1,Should have ZERO stars!,"I was drunk when I was tricked into buying this but contemplated suicide after seeing the first 5 minutes. I may not have known about ""ASYLUM"" movies but am very aware and on guard. Dont hurt your eyes on this one. Poor acting is no excuse for poor acting like this! I can draw stick images with better effects. And where was the robot on the cover? Was that its sole role for this movie to look cool on the cover and not even have a cameo appearance IN the movie? I was lucky I only lost 5 dollars buying this but I still want my money back!"
5,AWSOME MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!! THIS IS A MUST BUY!!!!!!,"THIS MOVIE IS THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I will recomend this movie to all of my friends for years to come. Whenever I have a girl over at my house, I'm going to pop this baby in the VCR, rewind it back to the beginning, and impress her with my knowledge of everything that has to do with robots. The graphics were great! But the most impressive things of all were the small unit tactics and advanced military technology employed by this film. The only downside that I can see, is that the cost of the laser guns alone must have been in the billions. So I doubt that this film is going to break even. That means that we may never get films like this one again, since the studios will most certainly be loath to spend that much money. That makes this film a national treasure. Thank you Leigh Scott, once again, you have outdone yourself, and you have cemented your reputation with this film."
4,Great Horrible Movie (not Transformers),"If you are looking for a great, cinematic blockbuster like Transformers, you are in the wrong place. If you are looking for a movie that is so cheesy and bad that it is absolutely hilarious, you have found it. Graphics and acting are definitely low grade material, but that all adds to the good laugh. Of course this was not intended to be a comedy.Also, though the hero is a man, there are more tough military women in the cast then men. Again, non of these women will be receiving an Oscar anytime soon, but I like strong female roles, and I enjoyed their roles in the movie (of course that is from a male perspective, so take that with a grain of salt. Don't know if I can get my wife to watch this for her feedback).P.S. I would have given it 5 stars, but I've seen a few movies that are more hilariously horrible."
1,Makes SciFi Originals Look Like Lord of the Rings,"Worst movie I have ever seen, and I've seen some real doozies. Special effects are awful, lasers coming out of the guns at odd angles and acting out recoil when gun is not going off, just to name a few. Acting is pitiful, to say no ones career will be launched from this ""film"" is an understatement. And the audio editing is awful, not to mention the Foley artist should be shot. When it comes down to it its obvious not a lot of time or effort went into this movie. I sometimes enjoy a cheesy movie with awful effects and sub par acting if it seems cared for, this movie however seemed like it was filmed just to have something on the disc while they tried to confuse people into buying it thinking it was Transformers. AVOID AT ALL COSTS."
1,Cinematic Cancer,"I can understand trying to make a quick buck off of combining 3 movies, but at least put forth an effort before producing and distributing cinematic cancer. The special effects, story, acting, and editing are all horrific. This movie is the Matrix meets Transformers on an incredibly small budget. Machines take over the planet accept for one ""undisclosed"" settlement for humans. The machines (TransFORMers) begin to close in on this location (terribly compared to Zion) and so they must engage (something like that of Starship Troopers). Please do not make the same mistake that I did by wasting any amount of time on this poisonous shred of leftover, already been done much better by real studios piece of trash."
1,More Garbage From Asylum.,"Step one: Pick up the new release with a cover and title very close to a new movie currently showing in theaters.Step two: Read the back of the box and see the ""Asylum"" brand.Step three: Laugh as you quickly put the box back on the shelf.Step four: Wash hands and be grateful you never wasted any money or time on this trash.My only question to the people who ""make"" these things and Guestar57 the ""reviewer"" who seems to love all Asylum productions, is it that hard to make a decent movie? Blair Witch was cheap, they knew that going in and played to their strengths, Asylum doesn't even seem to try."
1,TOTAL SEWAGE AND OFFAL!!,"This would get a minus -5 star rating if that were possible. Unfortunately the lowest I can give it is a 1.What a total waste of time and money. Lousy, wooden acting and really cheezy CGI effects that look like they were done by a sleepy five year old.DO NOT WASTE your money or time on this lousy stinker!"
3,1 thumb up,"I watched this on Instant (streaming) and wasn't sorry. This film does have some foreign language (when it does it's mostly French I think) which does not take away from the enjoyment. If you watch on a Roku XS you can enjoy this in HD and 5.1 Dolby Digital.The fighting scenes are not in the style of defy-gravity, so you might be let down if looking for that. Otherwise with a so-so storyline this flick (probably aims for the male audience) has some beautiful women, nice architecture, beautiful scenery, and interesting plot twists. It's at least rental worthy."
3,Good movie - deserved a better ending,"Great action movie with good action, photography, acting, etc. A lot of the dialog is not in English so were subtitles needed, a little too annoying for my tastes. Guess they just got lazy at the end - not really an ending, the movie just stopped."
4,Very Entertaining,"I found this movie to be very entertaining, which I think is all that it aspired to be. I had never heard of the graphic novels, so I had no expectations. No Oscar nominations for the acting, but I thought the cast was well chosen and the performances were basically solid. When I realized Largo was going to be something of an action hero, I was initially skeptical of Sisley in the role...seemed a bit too pretty....but he carried it off very well. I thought the action scenes were exceptionally well done, and I'm not a particular fan of action scenes. I did think some parts of the plot were a bit predictable, but I wouldn't recommend investing any effort on trying to figure things out. The fun in this movie is just watching it happen, and who cares how it all comes out."
2,Disappointed :(,"A story of an unlikely rebel inheriting a massive fortune and control over a mega corporation. The lines were predictable, the acting boring and the plot somewhat disconnected. It was fun to see Kristen Scott Thomas speak flawless French though! Sorry I wasted my money."
5,ABSOLUTELY AN INTENSE + ENGROSSING MOVIE,"FROM THE OPENING SCENE TO THE TERRIFIC FINALE THIS GEM OF A MOVIE COMPLETELY HOLDS YOUR INTEREST. A MURDERED MULTI-BILLIONAIRE'S ADOPTED SON MUST PROVE HIS IDENTITY WHILE EVADING SOME NASTY, VIOLENT PEOPLE WHO WANT HIM DEAD AND ALSO TRY TO FIND OUT WHO MURDERED HIS FATHER. THIS IS AN ALL REGION VERSION [USA INCLUDED] WITH AN OPTION FOR FRENCH LANGUAGE ONLY OR ENGLISH INTERSPERSED WITH FRENCH. HAS ENGLISH OR CHINESE SUBTITLES"
1,Misleading,"This is the same movie as ""Largo Winch"" released in 2010. It's just got a different cover and name and is being sold as the follow up which it isn't. ""Largo Winch 2"", called ""The Burma Conspiracy"", is not yet released for North America. Despite the duplicity if not dishonesty the French, in this and as they often do, still produce creative action, chase, thriller movies. So four stars for that aspect with dialogue being it's primary weakness along with a few over-the-top implausibilities."
1,Dreadful,"There are only two good things about this preposterous piece of drek: the photography and the babe. Other than that, watch this ONLY if you're brain dead and can't figure out a better way to kill 108 minutes.The plot is preposterous, the kind you'd find in a comic book. The dialog is wooden, the acting -- except for Kristen Scott -- is awful, the editing sucks and it's not even entertaining. AVOID! If I could give it zero stars, I would.As for those who gave this piece of sh*t five stars -- you must have watched a different movie from the one I saw, or you are seriously immature. This is a stupid waste of celluloid and time."
5,Wayfarers: the scent of life,"As winter turns to spring and spring to summer, the characters in ""Wayfarers"" go through their own transformations, which seem to parallel the passing of the seasons.One of the running themes is the issue of where a person belongs, their roots, the dichotomy between the drive to get away and the simple happiness which comes from living on one's native land, surrounded by familiar people.But Hamsun's approach is never a theoretical, intellectual one, but rather a heart-breaking and painfully personal journey.This novel will stay with me as an overwhelming memory, not because it gives answers to life's dilemmas, but because it poses crucial questions which stir the mind and awaken reflections on the human experience, all with the background landscape of sailboats on the Norwegian sea --"
4,A great read about an extremely interesting character!,"Hamsun has another winner here in this adventure tale, taking place in Norweigen costal villages & on the high seas. The book follows the travels of August (who appears in 2 other Hamsun novels) & Edevart, 2 good friends out to make good in the world and become men of respect. The tale is told at a brisk pace and is filled with many colourful, vivid descriptions of people, places & things. While the book is mainly light, filled with August's very funny antics & boastings, Hamsun is definately making a statement on how one can either waste their life away or buckle down and ""be a man""."
4,beautifully plotted,"any mystery lover knows how hard it is to find an author who can fool you. well, patricia sprinkle can fool her readers completely.in addition to a first-rate plot, there are well-drawn characters, sprinkle's wonderful turns of phrases--the woman can write--good dialogue, and realistic responses to situations.i enjoyed this book a lot, but i'm giving it four stars instead of five because it will probably not end up in my permanent collection, as sharyn mccrumb and margaret maron, for two examples, automatically do. however, i will be loaning it out with an enthusiastic recommendation to all my mystery-reading friends."
5,Love the series,Just ordered this as part of Amazon's recommendation list and love it. Just ordered the rest of the series. Being from NC I love the Southern slant and I thought the mystery element was done very well. Now I'm looking forward to more from her.If you love her series-try all of Laura Childs books--they're excellent too and similar feel.
5,Awesome!,"This is an incredible product! As with all sheep snacks, this is a great resource for parents (especially) that will help to engage and facilitate (by using ""the Fridge"" devo questions)""God conversations"" with their kids. It's got spunky humor, engaging story lines & graphics, and unbeatable content (it's all Scripturally based). If you're looking for a great resource as a parent, or as a Christian worker who wants to equip parents, then you should for sure check out Sheep Snacks!(P.S. I'm posting this review on ALL SIX Vids...since they're so wicked sweet!)"
4,Bob Dylan didnt have this to sing about.,"This is a CD single of ""Right Here, Right Now"" by Jesus Jones, an English alternative pop-rock group. It was their biggest hit in America. There are three remixes of it here. Good song."
3,Buy SB-600 instead,"I originally bought this to use it with my D60 and SB-800, with the aim to control lighting and place in in different directions ...etc. After I bought it I discovered it's more suited to Macro photography (with the help of additional accessories).I should have bought the SB-600 instead, the price difference is relatively minor and it has the below added benefits1- It will work wireless, and on the camera if I want to2- It has higher guide number3- It has and faster recharge time I guess (not really sure of this).4- Uses normal AA batteries, and you can use rechargeable ones. The Sb-R200 uses CR1234A batteries, which are expensive and not rechargable."
3,OK but better choices out there,I would buy one again but I think there are better choices for the money. I tried the extended range antenna. That was a joke! I may as well have wrapped tinfoil on my head and danced around like a fool.
2,Mid-Grade router,"The router itself is an easy setup, and works fine. However, I purchased this router in an attemp to obtain greater wireless range within my home, and it did not perform any better than my OLD Linsys WRT54G. Matter of fact I would recommend to those of you serious about wireless capabilities to find an old Linksys and then visit dd-wrt's web site. You will save some $$ and get a MUCH better router."
3,good overall headunit,"Nice headunit. But, I have trouble putting the face back on after I take it off. Pioneer should've made that part easier. First I have to fit a tiny pin into a hole on the right side. And then I have to get these two other pieces to catch together on the left side. Maybe I just lost my coordination...so, I hardly ever take the face off.Playing an mp3 disc in random mode, I was expecting that the next song button would take me to a random song, but instead the headunit actually goes to the next song in the folder. And the previous song button goes to the previous song in the folder. That's a bit annoying. It basically defeats the purpose of ""random"".I also got the pioneer ipod controller, and controlling that through this headunit are terrible. I only use the ""next song"" and ""previous song"" buttons. In this mode, I can't even fastforward or reverse.A few annoyances that I just have to live with, but overall the unit has been working well."
4,Great Product,"Great aftermarket CD deck. Worked perfectly and had no troubles with it at all. I installed by myself and I got it working the first time I hooked it up.Loved the MP3 disc feature as I could make CDs of 150 songs or more, which saved me on the number of CDs i had to burn. Would recommend this product if you're looking for something inexpensive but reliable."
1,False Idol,"Idol attempts to reinvent himself in the media-inspired cyber mania of the early 90s, and fails miserably. The end result is as laughably dated as it is difficult to listen to. Save your money and buy older Idol. You'll thank me."
1,ugh,This album is mostly terrible. Most of the reasons why have been covered in other reviews. I would only like to add that the 'cover' of The Velvet Underground's 'Heroin' is so ridiculous and awful that I reccomend checking it out for humor's sake.
2,American POP IDOL lost,"I don't think that this guy is really a good singer. Besides his commercial style and Macho manners towards the audience... Iam being sick and tired by listening to it. Rebell yel is okay,...but the others are part of the major of music TASTE."
2,American Idol lost /chaotic guy!,"I dont think he is a good pop singer,... Rebell yell is okay...but the other songs are a part of major musical taste,...."
2,american idol lost,"I dont think that his whole songs are the best one. Rebel yell is okay, but the other one are part major of musical taste."
5,A Masterpiece,Out of 800 or so albums i own this one is among the best. Been listening to it regularly since it came out a decade ago. I listen to everything - every catagory you can think of. There are brillant albums in any genre. This is one of them. Interesting concept. Multifaceted musically. Increadible voice. Fascinating mix which constantly keeps my ears intersted. I'm not a dedicated Billy Idol fan. I sold Whiplash Smile a few weeks after i bought it. Rebel Yell has some great songs. Cyberpunk is some else - Billy Idol and Mark Younger-Smith created a musical conceptual and lyrical masterpiece.
4,Not Billy But Billy,"This is not your regular Billy Idol CD. It's a different sound, but saying that, it's still great music from a great singer/songwriter. I personally loved it but I would not be sure everyone will. Check out some previews if you can."
5,"Possibly Idol's best, most evolved work","Chalk me up as another casual Billy Idol fan until I started to listen to CYBERPUNK. As a whole, the many and varied pieces here may *not* grab you on the first or even the second listening. But eventually you come to recognize the genius and pure entertainment of one track after another, culminating in the rapturous juggernaut of MOTHER DAWN. Put it on, let it run from beginning to end a few times, and you'll be hooked for life...and regrettably sad that this album was not recognized for the Magnum Opus that it was, for Idol's unique musical career."
4,Very consistent album,"Billy Idol's last album Cyberpunk was very well done. I couldn't believe the bad reviews given to it back in 1993. This was a very creative album. Idol was getting into this electronica sound long before the late 90s trend of it was getting onto it. And he succeeded on most levels, combining it with his guitar rock. The first song Wasteland is so funky as well as Shock to The System. The song Heroin is also solid. While his longtime songwriting and music partner Steve Stevens is missed on this album, Idol decided to move on and make this album. A few numbers are a little weird and don't fit with Billy's style. But the album is daring in its approach to its music and the landscapes it brings. As his new album hits stores this week on March 29th, this past album deserves far more respect than it's getting. This ranks right up there with his best '80s albums and 1990's Charmed Life."
1,Problem With Drive,"The first drive I ordered wount not mount on the firewire port. My other firewire devices worked ok on those ports, and the USB mount was ok, so I sent it back. The new drive that I got still wouldn't mount on firewire, though it would mount in USB. Tech support says there are no other problems, but I find it difficult to believe that I got the only 2 duds.Now tech support says there is an ""issue"" with macs. They are sending me an older version of the product. Tech support is terrible, customer service is worse."
4,"Bought this on a whim, can't stop listening to it!","Even though I had never heard this CD, I kept reading about this artist and decided to purchase the CD. I was very pleased! Rachael Sage's songs are deep and memorable. I find myself singing or humming them at the oddest times. My favorite song is definitely ""Sistersong"". Thanks Rachael for brightening my life with your music. I am looking forward to getting the new CD soon."
5,Love it!!!,"I love this jogger, it's lightweight and easy to maneuver. It folds down neatly and my baby loves it! I wish he could sit more upright in it, I have found the tray obstructs his view since he can't sit straight up, but there isn't much space to put items in the tray anyway, and we are ok without it, so I removed it. We clip small toys to the frame (so he can't throw them out the side) and that does just fine. I like the larger canopy, though I wish the bottom storage compartment were a little bit larger. But we use it to work out and go to the park, and not for really long day trips, so it fits our needs perfectly. Well worth the money! I get a lot of compliments on this stroller too, you don't need to spend $400 for a BOB!"
4,good performance for the money,"It rolls extremely well, very quiet and very maneuverable. When my four month old was in it, it went over speed bumps and rough terrain very gently and she liked to stay in it. The sun shade was not big enough to really block the sun or rain and it didn't quite stay in the position you wanted it to. In general it's easy to operate but after you fold it it doesn't stay on the ground very well and tends to fall. It's also quite heavy for me to carry, though my husband doesn't complain about the weight. It doesn't fit into my 99 camry trunk easily. My husband often needs to take out one wheel and try to squeeze it in with some force. So far I haven't used it by myself yet but it works great for family outings. If you're a petite female and has to carry your baby out a lot, I'll definitely take the weight and how it fits into your car into serious consideration and that's why I give it four stars."
5,"Comfortable, Easy to Use",I've had this stroller for a few months now and I have no complaints about it. It's very comfortable to use when jogging or walking. Easy to get on the sidewalk or off. There is a water bottle holder for me and one for the baby. It's also comfortable for my husband who is about 6 feet tall.
1,up to 50 pound stroller,The only reason I am rating this stroller a 1 is Amazon has it listed that is usable for a child up to 100 pounds. It actually is only 50 pounds. It is now being returned.
4,"Good stroller, but locked position defective","I was thrilled with this stroller, and like almost everything about it. It glides very smoothly, is comfortable for jogging or walking, very maneuverable, etc. However, I was disappointed to discover that there had been a flaw in the manufacturing, and when the front wheel is in the locked position, it veers to the right. You can't really jog with it in the swivel position, because the front wheel shimmies when you go too fast."
5,The best baby purchase we made!,"We have been abusing... OOOPS I mean ""using"" this stroller for a week now... We are on the go kind of people, and part of the ""on the go"" life style includes a lot of nature walks... We have taken this stroller on pavement (even and not), up steep dirt roads, over very uneven early spring dried marsh lands and this stroller has not failed us! It has kept our baby safe and happy... It is light and easy to manuver... It is a larger stroller, and fits well (with lots of space into the trunk of our Grand Prix SE... TOP RATINGS ALL THE WAY."
5,Awesome stroller,"I really love this stroller! It was very easy to put together! My daughter loves riding in it, and she has never liked riding in strollers before. The only problem I have had was when my stroller arrived, all three tires where flat. When I went to pump them up, I noticed that all three tires had been ""slashed"". I just had to go down to Walmart to get new inner tubes, so it didnt bother me to much."
4,Good stroller,"I just had this stroller for a week.I have only one complain: when I received it, I was disappointed because, what I received was not the new- original package. The package look like someone return it. And when I open it, i can see some dirty space below the basket.I would hope they give me a brand new stroller.... that what I paid right?But I still keep the stroller. First because I needed it. Second, I hate to send back and forth. And third, he stroller is very light and great for me."
3,Troche techniczna pora&#380;ka.,"Trolley is ok, but from the time of purchase for two years we had to deal with a few things on the technical side. I recommend this stroller to very flat surfaces only."
4,Russian Electronic Abstraction,"I stumbled onto this CD while in London and find I return to it over and over again. Very well done - abstract and minimal electronic sound paintings - one of the more interesting compilations I've heard. In the same genre as Aphex Twin, Pole and Autechre, but not as vacant or repetitve. A closer comparison might be Boards of Canada or Susumu Yokota, but with some beat and more interesting sound morsels. This music has a slight postmodern edge, but also has mystery and deep passages. Highly recomended!"
4,Help for Those Who are Hurting,"This book, Conscious Divorce, is extremely helpful and positive, and after reading a section or chapter, I feel supported and not so alone. Not only is the content practical, such as advice about finances and the legal system, but there are spiritual rituals and supportive affirmations that make me feel better when I read them. Going through a divorce can feel devastating, and stressful. I like that this book focuses on ways to heal and move on! I'm tired of all the media focus on divorce as adversarial. It can be a time of introspection and transformation, a time to go in new directions, but still be able to forgive your partner, and treat each other with integrity. This is what Conscious Divorce advocates. Bravo."
3,Very small!,"This bath gel is very small & not very full. It looks full in the picture, but it is flat looking in real life."
5,Chun Li,"I have the blue costume version of this, sculpting and detailing is very good as is the paint work."
1,To Reign in Hell is boring as hell.,"Paracelsus, an old enemy of Vincent's, kidnaps Catherine and Vincent goes in search of her. She is being held deep down in the sewers, a few days travel for Vincent. Most of the show is about Vincent's journey which is mind-numblingly boring. I found myself fast forwarding through much of it. Catherine is hardly in the show at all, and she is the main reason I watch. Please do not buy this video. It is sorely disappointing."
2,Disappointed,"Myra waits all this time for revenge and is even told she can't go to China because of Jack Embry snooping around ....so she leaves the house, which is command center for their project, to go pick up Christmas Trees?????? The first two books were very good and held my interest but I was disappointed in this one which should have been the best of the three because it was Myra's turn."
1,Begrudging,"I have never read a book by Fern Michaels, and I have no intentions of reading another book by her!I decided to buy this narrative because the story line grabbed my attention. But, the author failed to deliver a good story.IT'S STUPID!!! I really wish writers would put more time and effort into their projects. There is no way she tried to put her best effort into this story. IT'S TOO STUPID!!!"
1,Banality and unjustified violence,"Read Beth S - her review says it all.I haven't read any of the prior books in this series so I have no attachment to these characters as there was no character exposition in this novel. Would the violence be more justifiable to me if I knew and cared for these characters? No.A drunk driver hit and killed a woman. He did not, as far as I know from what the novelist has given us, deliberately murder her. This vacuous gaggle of women deliberately kidnap and skin another human being. The dead woman's daughter cheers her on.I was hoping these cold blooded women were caught and stopped from their serial crime spree.The characters are so artificial and banal. The women are not interesting. There is no build up of tension and the criminals get away in the end.If you care about young minds don't let them read this type of tripe. Strong women are not psychos."
2,Disappointed,"This is the first book I have read in the Sisterhood series (buying it without realizing it was part of a series). Nothing clicked for me in this story. I thought it was ridiculous, especially the dead daughter, Barbara, talking to her mother and her sister. Stupid revenge tactics, weak characters and poorly crafted plots make me very sure that I will not be reading anymore of the remaining sisterhood books in this series."
2,Ok...Gettin A Bit Stupid...,"I have been enjoying this series by Fern Michaels about the vigilante sisterhood because they are entertaining one day reads, despite the annoying Jack that keeps popping up. This one, however, the third in the Sisterhood, is rather stupid. Myra Rutledge, the money behind the gal group finally gets her name chosen out of the shoebox and can avenge her daughter's death. I found the whole story, 3 women secretly entering China, kidnapping the bad guy, whisking him off to America and basically beating the tar out of him, and then dumping him in England and never getting caught rather far fetched. Meanwhile, the annoying Jack keeps popping up breaking and entering and violating about 5000 laws himself. (At this point, who is this guy to judge?) Give me a break! The girls are starting to grow on me however, so I will read one more. This series gets one more shot with me and if the fourth is not better, I will not waste any more money."
1,Bad Karma,"Why I finished this book is one question and why anyone would write such trash is the other. The idea that being a vigilante is attractive and fun is so vulgar. These are ""supposedly"" intelligent women who think it is okay to inflict pain and take the law into their own hands while the heiress just eases the pain of her daughter's death by buying them and having fun at the pain of other people. While the language is simple, the gist of the story is purely evil. My recommendation is don't buy this book."
3,Vendetta,"'Vendetta is a great tie-in book. I would like to see a little more meat in the sisters stories, however. 'The Sisterhood Series' is a wonderfully twisted look at ""ladylike"" revenge. Keep them coming Ms Michaels. Thanks from some devoted ""twisted sisters""."
1,"This book is sick, dumb and lame.","So, Myra's daughter dies in an accident. An ACCIDENT... that was, near's I can tell her own fault when she stepped into traffic. Of course, the driver should have stopped but his leaving did not cause the death. But somehow this makes him a predator in Ms Michaels head!I could not stand to finish this book and will read the fine print on my shampoo bottles before I consider touching another in the series.(No relation to anyone in Chicago.)"
5,Very good!,I enjoyed reading this book as I have the other sisterhood books. Am looking forward to the new book coming out soon. I haven't been bored or thought any of the sisterhood books are silly. Too bad in real life one can't do payback as the group of women are able to do.Keep up the great writing Fern!!
4,Interesting,As we move on with the Sisterhood it gets more interesting each time. I just wait for the next one to come out. I love Fern Michaels books and the Sisterhood has me hooked.
3,Myra DID it! She got her revenge!! YEAH!!!,"If Fern Michaels DOES NOT QUIT writing the F word and G..D... in her books, I am not going to read another one! She would have gotten a 5 from me had this book gone without those words.Why do writers think they have to scatter really bad language in their stories. People don't buy books for TRASH but for entertainment. MOST of us DO NOT WANT THOSE WORDS that are so trashy in our literature.You know, I have just lowered my rating to 3 stars because of the above. I feel really strongly, Fern about this matter.As for the book, I bought it yesterday and read it last night.I liked the plot and was so afraid something was going to happen to Myra.I am looking forward to reading The Jury and hope to hear from Fern that she'll clean her writing and not use those words. Otherwise, I'll not be buying any books she writes."
2,Worse book of the series,"Myra worked the nerves in this book. The love scenes between her and Charles were ridiculous and took up too much of the book. Otherwise, is just wasn't as good as the others. This series has really taken a nose dive.I hope Sweet Revenge brings this series back up because The Jury sure didn't. Except for the character of Jack, the book was boring. He and his friends keep the series lively."
3,discrepancies,"So far have enjoyed the books of the Sisterhood, but there are some glaring discrepancies. Murphy the dog was described in the first book as a Belgian Malinois, and in Vendetta is suddenly a German Shepherd. The breeds are siumilar, but shouldn't the author keep these things straight?!"
3,Formula Fails,I don’t understand why the “Sisterhood” series has so much gratuitous foul language. This has begun to ruin the whole series for me. The ‘girls’ escapades are fun in concept but they are a bit vicious in their operations. I’m not rating the rest because it is such formula writing that I get tired of reading the same words over and over.
4,A fair and unbiased report,This great book follows all your favorite gymnasts through gymnastics careers. It shows how they got started in gymnastics and how their love of their sport goes above and beyond all
5,Magnificent Seven..... Ideal Book for any gymnastics fan!!!!,"This book is not only a great story- It is a collector's item!! With tons of GREAT pictures, this book features every member of the Magnificent Seven, with their story of that memorable night in Atlanta, and a short biography of their gymnastics life, from when they started gymnastics, to what the future has in store for them! It also lists all of their addresses so you can write to any one of them. It is SO worth your money!!"
1,Degree in engineering,A one page hand illustrated instruction sheet is all you get to put this thing together. Mine still sits in pieces. Total dissappointment
1,Not So Good!,"Purchased two sets of these plugs. My husband put them in the next day and the car ""Check Engine"" light came on and the car could barely move in first or second gear. It would just sputter and it was a very dangerous situation as I could not pull out into traffic without fear of being hit. We then swapped the plugs back to the original plugs that had been in my car for 10 years and the car ran perfectly. We then put in two plugs at a time and neither set worked - but didn't actually make the check engine light come on. Again back to the original plugs and the car ran great.I then called the manufacturer and received some of the worst customer service ever. They will only let you leave a message and when they finally call you back - get this - you are supposed to pay to ship the items back and if they test them and the plugs do not meet their quality standards - then they will send you the amount for the plugs. Nothing like making it difficult on a customer that is already frustrated!"
3,"Recording Produces Music from Separate Speakers, Not Merged Soundstsage...",Please be aware in considering purchase of this particular 'live' CD version that the sound will come distractingly from your separate speakers rather than merge into the central sound-stage. I assume that the other 'non-special' Mutter recording of the same material costs more because the engineers have corrected their mistake while this version is being slowly cleared off the market.
2,Disappointing,"I was waiting for this album to be released thinking that it would be an enlightening experience to hear what these musicians do with the trios. Instead of expressing grace and subtlety, they plow through the trios with no sensitivity to nuance, character, or color. Terribly disappointed with the pianist who should have taken time to thoroughly work out the technique and think through the phrasing to capture the Mozartian grace. He sometimes captures a boyish charm and spirit, but I expected so much more from such a respected musician. The violinist is interesting in her approach, but her tone is edgy at times. The cellist does no harm-- but then again, the cello part is not prominent.If you would like to hear some beautiful Mozart trios, try Maria Pires, Dumay, and Wang."
2,A Political Tract,"On the face of it an adventure story. Ex-SAS man trapped into a chase which is actually designed to lead to his own death. Nail-biting stuff to the end.Actually, a political tract with a decidely anti-EU message. There is even a tag at the end of the book to tell you where you can find out more about the threat which the EU. according to Mr Strong, represents."
5,SOY~REBELDE~FANATICA!!!,"This is the second season of the highly comical and addictive telenovela REBELDE and I love this show! I know there is are a lot of silliness in ths show but it also addresses many issues that are important to teens in an accessible way.. It's great and the love stories are great between Miguel and Mia ""Barbie"" and Diego and Roberta... Plus the additional cast members are excellent too!"
2,too much missing.,There are way too many important scenes cut out.I was excited to see that I could find the dvds in the US.It's confusing and makes non sense to the person who buys this I hope you really remember the soap opera.I should have waited until going to Mexico to find the dvds.
3,They cut too much,"i agree with the previous reviews, they cut waaaaaay too much, i wouldnt mind paying more for the whole thing, since it is worth it. I love it though is better than nothing, i rather have this little bit and watch and watch it, than not have anyting at all"
1,Mystery,"The guy from Unsolved Mysteries, In A Mystery Movie, Mystery why it was released...Plot: Eliot Ness and his green partner go somewhere, shoot someone, find a clue, and repeat. Don't waste your time!"
2,Not the real/complete version,"This is a very lean version, with some characters being removed or merged with other characters. Whole sections of original dialogue have been removed, or at best, changed. Avoid this version like a robot plague."
3,"Well written, factual, maybe too indepth","I have Dr. Norris for my endocrinology class. The text book goes further in depth than his lectures which can be a pro and a con. The text is very small and sometimes confusing, but when you work though it provides the reader with a strong backbone knowledge of endocrinology. Some figures are a bit too confusing. More simplistic pictures and color figures would greatly improve the book."
1,no Info,"I am A amazon customer I can not understand why anyone would not give me info needed to buy, or forget it!!!!! LIKE, IS THIS PRODUCT made FROM STEEL OR LEAD I'ed Like To HAVE one But I'll Have To go someplace ealse and find one again & again Thanks BILL???????????"
1,They are extremely slow!!!!!,"DO NOT ORDER FROM THESE PEOPLE! I REPEAT, DO NOT ORDER FROM THEM! They are total crooks! I placed an order on the 7th for a college textbook, and still have not received it! Mind you, today is the 29th! I plan to file a claim on this seller, and hope that they are kicked off of Amazon. Their prices are not worth the hassle, time, and inconvenience you will incur! I have attempted to send multiple emails to the seller, and have gotten 0 responses! I have never had such a horrible experience with Amazon. If I could, I would give them 0 out of 5 stars! This is the WORST SELLER EVER!"
2,OK book,I bought this book for my merchendsing class and its quite boring with little math exlaination. Also be careful who you buy it from the one I recived was full of writing and the book itself was pretty messed up.
3,Great intro book,For anyone new to the field of Merchandise planning this is a godsend. It halps to sort out and explain the terminology you will encounter and the math required to perform you duties.
3,Ain't nothing like the real thing,"My brothers and sister and I all grew up listening to Larry Norman, and his songs are a part of our lives. His music struck a chord with our parents, and the lyrics still ring true. All the artists that covered Larry Norman's songs did a great job of making the songs their own, but nothing beats the originals. Larry still gives the best concert around -- my sister and I saw him at Creation '99 in PA, two of the four kids under 25 who sang all his songs right along with him. If you do enjoy this CD, then you *MUST* hear the original."
4,Wilderness Enough....,"Outstanding. If you can only get one book about this defining movement in American art, get this one. An absorbing and comprehensive grasp of the movement of the Hudson River School with stunning full-color reproductions. Best of all is the well researched narrative on the flow and development of the HRS, from its beginnings, through maturity and finally its end. A must for art history students and anyone susceptible to enchantment."
5,Wonderful,"Man this stuff is great!How's that for a sophisticated, erudite review?Excellent performance, excellent recording, excellent music."
4,"A British ""Popular Electronics"", almost good","Ever since ""Popular Electronics magazine"" ceased to exist, I have been reading this as a substitute.While it is British and sometimes painful for its formality and repetition, it is fulfills a nostalgic longing I have for Popular Electronics, and its content of construction projects and hobbyist information. It really is almost a good substitute.Cheers."
1,Greedy company.,"I used to subscribe this magazine, in both hardcopy and electronic version for several years.When I tried to renew the electronic version of the magazine, I found that the electronic version was discontinued.It was replaced for an online rental for twice the price.Greedy company."
5,Old Time Gospel Favorites by the Cluster Pluckers,This is an excellent CD! The vocals are excellent and has the wonderful old time sound to it. This is a must if you enjoy the old gospel favorites.
2,Doesn't stay on table,"My table is outside, so the look of the product wasn't a huge deal. But the weights on the corners don't make any difference what so ever. I wanted a cover that would stay on when the wind blows & to keep my cats off of the felt, but it's not happening with this pool table cover"
3,Interesting and sad,"Loved being able to see Barbaro's races and of course it was very sad that the ending had to be as it was. However, at least there are some proceeds that also go to help or charity (I do not recall the specifics). It was an interesting watch."
3,Barbaro DVD,"NBC sports documentary on Barbaro from interviews with his trainer, jockey, owners and vet. Factual and somewhat dry given the emotions generated by the tragedy of this beautiful racehorse."
4,Barbaro,"I'm a horse lover & racing lover. This movie nicely captures the spirit of Barbaro, the love of his owners, his struggle to beat the odds. For those of us who have also lost horses we love, you can't help but tear up."
3,Review,"I was a little disappointed. I remember watching and taping it on TV, and remembered it being MUCH more in depth."
3,Only okay...,"I've gotta say, I'd give this one star except for the fact that my daughter actually sat through the whole thing and watched it. The video is SO annoying... I think there's gotta be better educational videos for teaching numbers out there. She also didn't ask to watch it again after it ended like she does so many of her other shows."
5,love it,"these videos are great My 3 year old knew all his letters,shapes,colors and numbers .he watches them over and over!"
5,A fun way to learn numbers.,My 18 month old daughter loves this DVD. The number characters are fun and she learned 1 to 10 very quickly. I wasn't surprised that she did after having such great success with the Meet the Letters video. I really love this series and I feel so much better about having her watch this educational video instead of Barney.
2,Very boring,"The repetition here may help little ones learn their numbers, but it is extremely boring. No songs, no story, nothing. Just numbers over and over. My 2 year old doesn't want to sit and watch it unless he is very tired, and I find it hard to encourage it because I find it so boring."
1,LAME,"This is the lamest, most boring educational DVD yet. I really don't understand all the hype over this series. My two year old can't stand these, and neither can I. Compared to the clever, creative Leap Frog series these are just pitiful. DO NOT waste your money."
2,Boring,"This is a potentially beneficial product for the 2 and under set. My son who is 3 and a half found the video to be boring. He did sit through the first viewing, but has not since requested to view it again. My 9 month old did stare intently at the screen...so maybe all is not loss. We shall see."
4,This audio makes you want MORE of Jay OCallahan.,"The very young, adolescent and parents will all enjoy these short stories. OCallahan's voice inflections are the best and you will find yourself trying them long after the stories are through. My eleven year old has listened to these stories for 3-4 years and still requests this tape to listen to on trips in the car. Real FEEL GOOD storytelling."
3,"Not up to standard, but alternatives are thin on the ground","The only reason to recommend Michelin Sicily would be that nothing much better is widely available. I drove in Sicily extensively and I was not impressed with this map: their printing quality looks cheap in this day and age, distances between points are confusing and preciseness leaves much to be desired.Maybe I set my standards too high, but this is not an excellent product. If you are driving in Sicily, you will probably be stuck with this map anyway, just do not have inflated expectations.For those who go to Sicily to look at Godfather and Godfather 2 locations - yes, it DOES have indications of both Forza d'Agro and Savoca (near Taormina, that's eastern coast). And yes, in Savoca they have Bar Vitelli where Michael Corleone talked to Apollonia's father, yes, that bar is still open, and yes, you can sit in Corleone's chair and yes, the curtain is still there, you can touch it."
2,Trop conervateur,"Ce livre nest pas tres petit à vrai dire (assez épais vue à quon trouve entre les fourres), par contre plusiers fois en le consultant je n'avais pas reussi à trouver le sens voulu du mot recherché. En plus en le feuilletant j'ai rencontré bien des mots propres à la litterature des siècles oublies et d'argot scintifique; pourtant j'ai eu du mal à trouver le sens courrant des mots quotidiènes: ceux qu'on peut qualifier ""de bas registre"" peut-tre, mais... Il contient pas mal de locutions aussi, mais malhereusement les plus recents ou ceux quon ne trouve que chez les jeunes sont presque toujours manquants. Et j'aimerais bien savoir à quoi sert-il de mettre les étymoligies dans une tel dictionaire?"
5,A Powerful Healing Process,"This book offers immediately usable healing processes that even those who are not familiar with meditation can use. I found Dr. Gaynor's approach of healing from deep within the spiritual core to be immensely moving and transformational. I have used the processes myself with astonishing results, and I highly recommend this book to anyone with issues that need healing, whether physical, emotional, spiritual, or all three."
2,Gaynor rehashes old alternative med news,"Gaynor is now sounding just like Depak Chopra, Bernie Segal and Andrew Weil. There is not much new in this volume and it reads as if a ghost writer cranked it out according to a Gaynor ""formula"". If this is the first time you've ever heard the empowered patient/you deserve a better doctor argument then this is not a bad quick fix. Gaynor's earlier books have greater nutritional value and actual content. This is a beginner's feel-better guide to a better cancer patient experience. It reminds me of Andrew Weil's trick of repackaging the same stuff ten ways to create new selling ""opportunities""."
2,Not well made,This toy fell apart within a week of playing with it. First a leg and then the lower half of the body.
2,So So,I didn't care for the writing style. To much emotion. Younger readers might like it. The only reason I finished it was because I had the first one for around twenty years. It was like a grudge match.
3,"Better, but not enough to redeem the series","Finally, at long, long, far-too-long last, the series starts to get interesting, and the characters who are left become almost likable. Of course, this is the last book in the series, and the overall effort is too little, too late."
1,Piece of junk - Do not waste your money,The title says it all. Do not waste your money. I did not return it but I was embarrassed enough that I had to buy another gift for my wife. Looks like a small plasticky junkware you will find in a one dollar store.
1,Not what I expected,This is the smallest Prada product I've ever seen! More like a pouch for lucky beans then an actual bag for actual use. Plus no handle to hold this mini drawstring bag. Unless you are shopping for Barbie I wouldn't buy this product.
2,"Stick with your keyboards, Ronnie","I am a huge Joy Electric fan. So I was very interested in this album.First, there are NO upbeat songs on this. Even songs like ""Sugar Rush"" and ""Disco for a Ride"" are slowed down to a depressing crawl, as are all the songs. I allow Ronnie a few sad songs, that is part of this great band. But I don't think any suicidal patient should ever be left with this album, ""Five Stars for Failure"" and a set of razor blades.Even that isn't such a bad thing if he didn't need to make every song sound like each other. Does ""unelectric"" need to mean ""no variety""?If you revel in these songs then you're in heaven here. But if you are waiting for grooves like ""Children of the Lord"" or ""Burgandy Years"" go listen to those albums."
1,One Star for Failure,"Wow. I just tried to listen to this album again. I enjoy JE's music for the most part but this album SUCKED! It was the most disappointing collection of dirges and lullabies I've heard in a long time. I bought this album at Salvation Army for $1 and I want my money back. I'm familiar with the original versions of most of the songs and love them, just not this album."
2,Off course,"After an incredible first CD, they seemed to get off course. All of a sudden the guy with the real voice in the band was not singing and the bass player started doing most of the vocals. This was a huge mistake. I recently heard their 3rd CD and they are back on track in a big way. Thank goodness because this band is one of my favorites."
4,Let the music do the talking...,"As other reviewers are quick to point out: no, this is not the same 80's glam metal rock band. In my opinion, it's better. In the 80's they jumped on the Hair Metal bandwagon and played music that everyone and their brother (or sister) was playing at the time. Kind of like ""80's Heart meets Poison"". On the third outing, they got rid of the ""glam"" and just played rock music. Some will like it, some will hate it. But I personally think they do better when they focus on just playing music instead of focusing on the make-up, the leather and the big hair. The only negative I can think of (besides the fact that the untitled song should have been left off) is that the project should have been called something else besides Vixen, since only two of the original four are on this recording (the singer and the drummer). But since it was called Vixen, I'll rate it as Vixen: talented musicians minus glam metal equals good rock album."
5,Album of the year and no one has heard it?,"This album, to me, is one of the best albums of 1998. Funny thing is that very few people have heard this CD. Radio has given it no airplay at all:( This is 11 of the strongest tracks Vixen has ever recorded. The title track ""Tangerine"" will blow the doors off. The song ""Shut Up"" says everything that we wish we could say to some people in our lives, but can't. The second single ""Air Balloon"" floats free and easy just like one. Pick this up, it is so good!!!"
4,"Very good album, with catchy pop/rock tunes.","Saw the band at New Jersey's Birch Hill club and purchased the CD at the show after these fine female musicians put on one hell of a show. If you love rock, and the galm metal days of the 80's with 90's touches, get the CD."
4,Nobby Voice Recognition Clock with an Interactive Personality,"This Nobby clock is fun. Nobby is an alien that could talk. Train him first, Then ask him questions like ""How do I look?"" Nobby is funny. Wring his neck to stop the alarm."
4,It Fits,The unit looks OK and works on my Volvo S40. I would order this one or similar one that's cheaper in the future.
3,"Not a must have, even for historical reasons.","This game is suprisely mediocre, but at $2, it was not the worst game I ever bought.I was disappointed to find that it won't even install under WinXP, but It runs fine under WinMe."
2,Poor quality,There was a difference of about 2 months between when this arrived and I was actually able to start using it.On first power on the voltage display works but the ampage display does not.It works for what I need but I have to be careful with the ampage as I have alreaby blown two 4 watt amps.
5,Good Product,"I really don't know if you need this filter wrap or if you do a lot of dusty riding. However, I like it for the dirt road riding I do during hunting season. This product does the job."
5,Don't pass it up folks!,If you are really interested in the Ohio Great Lakes region pick up this interesting book fast! Books like these tend to go out of print fast and then sell for high prices on the used market.
4,I want more!,"Lapis is a princess and magical girl from Sorcerer Land who loves pudding and is a little immature and ditzy. She uses her magic eraser power once to often and destroys things. To teach her responsibility, her mother tries to send her on a short journey to a lake in the kingdom and accidently sends her much farther. the whole family is a little spacey. they send her teacher and a protector after Lapis. The 3 episodes are all about Lapis's return to her kingdom while a witch wants her for her pretty little sister collection and she helps the people she encounters. I think it's funny and I'm glad it was finally licenced. While it's only 3 episodes, they are long enough and unlike many OAVs there is a complete ending; you aren't left hanging. I do wish another OAV had been made or it had been made into a series. It's definitly worth a watch."
3,Another lost angel.,"This is the CD single of Billy Idol's song ""L.A. Woman"", which reached #52 on the Hot 100. It is a pretty good cover version of a song by the Doors. It is an edited version of the song, which runs a minute and a half shorter than the version on the albumCharmed Life. The second song on the CD is ""License to Thrill"", which is a mediocre song fromCharmed Life. The third and last song on the CD is ""Lovechild"", which is a mediocre song from the charity albumNobody's Child. Here is the complete track listing:1. L.A. Woman (edit)2. License to Thrill3. Lovechild"
5,This CD Rocks!,As lots of kids i guess my mom wouldn't let me get the explicit lyrics CD but who cares. the bad words are taken out of promise and enemy i think. Promise is a tight song anyways so it doesn't matter. My fav is Heres To The Night. I reccomend you get this CD. Mine is still on the way but i downloaded songs so i know it is good! BUY THIS CD!!!!
2,"More of the same, only worse","Oh brother. More shallow ""rock"" that's getting enough air time to make pop groups jealous. Trendy catchy tune with no depth. It'll sell like hot cakes"
3,typed manuscript print makes reading difficult,wonderful collection of letter but it arrived as a bound type manuscript and not a normal paperback that one would expect from the description. the print is very light which makes it somewhat difficult to read.
5,Where has this movie been all my life?,"Actual dialogue:Washington: God! Man, look what they done to my car. Captain Roman's going to burn my ass.Samurai: Yeah, he's gonna burn it ... charcoal black!Washington: It is black!Samurai: Right on![They high five]'Nuff said."
5,stop reading and start purchasing,this movie is absolutely awesome... I usually watch bad movies with friends but I saw this one for the first time while solo and it still had me laughing like a maniac (but not like a maniac cop)I put a drinking game for this on the imdb message board - check it out
5,Epic,"This is the best movie I have ever seen. Top notch action, picture quality, and acting. I think my favorite part in the entire movie is the sexy nurse, which can be found on YouTube for anyone interested."
5,Compact and works fine,"It's small and compact and does all of the things a microwave should do. The extras like popcorn, soup, beverage automatic heating options are handy little add-ons. The timing seems to be perfect when using the defrost as well. I read other reviews about the loud beeping noises it makes, it may be a little louder than other microwaves, but for me that is a good thing as a mother if I'm in another room taking care of the kids or doing something I can hear when the microwave is done heating. That has been great to be able to leave the kitchen if I'm going to be heating something for 10 minutes or more and to know when it's done by hearing the beep. For an office that requires quiet, I don't suppose that is an attractive thing. It's not really THAT loud, but louder than most microwaves. It works fine, it's compact and sleek looking, and I am enjoying it. So far, so good."
3,Okay basic microwave but low power,"I replaced a very old microwave with this one and am basically happy with it for the price I paid. However, I have found that it does not seem as powerful as my old microwave. I mainly use it to reheat things, so it's not a big deal. But I have yet to get a FULL bag of popcorn from it. It also takes a bit longer than the directions say on most all frozen dinners. I hope to replace this one with a more powerful model and maybe save this one for my son to take to college. For those who've complained about the ADD ONE MINUTE feature not working ... it does work, but the cooking time left has to be less than one minute when you press the ADD ONE MINUTE button."
3,it works,"Microwave is ok. It works,cooks and reheats. You get what you pay for. The door has a tendency to stick quite often--you push the button and the door doesn't open. It is small so it doesn't hold large dishes. It worked in a pinch for a quick replacement, will do more research when it's time for a new one."
4,Brave Little Microwave...,"I've had this microwave for three years. I got it at Target for [..] dollars.It can't tell time. It doesn't heat up food very fast. It makes a loud humming noise while it heats up food. When it gets done heating your food, it makes an incredibly loud beeping sound that you can't turn off. There isn't a whole lot of room inside the microwave. The glass turntable is wobbly and unstable.But if you're like me, this microwave meets the only two requirements that matter. It heats up my food and it doesn't break."
4,The little microwave that could,"I got an excellent deal on this microwave. The functions are excellent for the price, and the size is just right for a small apartment kitchen. The only thing to complain about is that the buzzer that sounds when you push a button is so loud you could go deaf. Other than that, a great deal!"
1,Only lasted one week,"After reading the reviews, I was excited about finally finding a good microwave small enough to put on my counter. I had the microwave for one week and used it only a few times. It seemed to heat and defrost fine, however, the button to open the door broke. My food was trapped in the microwave. I wouldn't buy this brand of microwave again."
5,Simple and functional,"I bought this microwave after Katrina, and its been trucking right along without a glitch ever since. I like the compact size, it effectively reheats food, which is what I mostly use a microwave to do. The turntable is a nice feature, so that the item heats evenly.Its fairly smooth inside, allowing for easy cleanup. The turntable plate is also easy to clean-I know I have often boiled over milk and other foods, which can often be a mess to clean up.Its nothing fancy but its definitely one of those inexpensive 5 star purchases."
2,Westinghouse Microwave,"It's a small, but kind of nice little microwave, it doesn't have all the bells and whistles that my old one had, can't set or cook in the microwave with the timer going, and can't set multi-levels of cooking, but you can change the power level while it's going if you have set it for say, 30% power, you can change it while it's still going. It's just a simple, all together microwave. Surprisingly, it does heat up better then I thought for the lower power it has. And for some reason, I have to keep setting the digital clock on there, it keeps loosing time, but that's not a real importance in the cooking feature of it.Overall, it's a pretty nice little microwave, but don't expect it to do what a higher wattage or larger oven would do, it does take a bit longer to heat things up, but overall, I kind of like it."
4,"Pretty Good, directions SUCK!","I like the way the station works. Hopefully the outside weather attachment will hold up. The numbers are easy to read and I like the time projection on the ceiling. Setting the clock up is a pain. The direction book is small and not very easy to follow. I almost sent it back because I didn't feel like dealing with the directions. Once I got it running, I like it. The outside transmitter doesn't transmit anywhere near as far as it claims. I originally set it up in our guest room less than 20 feet from where the outside transmitter was mounted and it wouldn't connect."
4,LaCrosse Technology WS-9520U Wireless Projection Weather Station,Bought this as a Christmas gift. Will know next month if it was a hit.
2,Weather Station,"Product works well, and has some nice features for a Bedside night stand. Unfortunately the size of the information, makes it hard to read if it's more than several feet away."
1,WORST EXPERIENCE,Got the clock delivered correctly -- but with a faulty outdoor sensor. Vendor says to return & he will not reimburse my shipping charge (to retrun).Amazon said they would get back to me with a discount on item AND HAVE NOT GOTTEN BACK!!!I had to follow-up & have now entered an 'A to Z Guarantee claim' -- for which I have no idea how long I will have to wait.The clock was delivered on December 14 -- so it is a MONTH today -- not sure what can be done!
4,Good Product,This weather station is a solid workhorse. It has all the features I wanted and the projection feature is a nice touch as I use it when I go out to work in the dark since my wife is still asleep. The atomic clock works as promised. The temperature is accurate with my regular thermometer and I really like the humidity feature. My only problem is that it was hard to set and the it seems to indicate weather forecast changes that don't actually happen. I have adjusted the sensitivity to the changes but it has not helped. I like the weather boy who shows me how much to bundle up before I go out. That feature does seem accurate. Overall I would recommend it but again it is difficult to set at first but you should not have to fool with that again.
4,great product,"We love this clock and weather station it works great and the projection is nice to ne able to see the time and temp when its dark in the bedroom. Only reason for 4 stars is I wish the buttons were a little easier to use for setting the time and alarms.... they can be a little bit confusing cuz the buttons do multiple things and the hour is on one side and the minute is on the other side, instead of right above each other like most clocks are set up, not too big of a deal cuz the clock never needs set just the alarms. Overall I would recommend this to someone."
5,Great Product with Lots of Features,"I bought one for me and another two for family members. The ""tell you what to wear today"" feature is great and quite accurate. Dual alarm is good if you need two different wake up times and my personal favorite, the clock and temperature on the ceiling all night long."
3,La Crosse Technology WS-9520U Wireless Projection Weather Station with 24 Forecast Icons and Atomic Clock,"Unit is ok, I wish I could mount it on the wall. It is difficult to set up."
3,"Overall Good, Atomic Clock Doesn't Work in my area","Overall I like this product. It's pretty reliable and the changing outfits of Oscar are quite amusing. For some reason, the atomic clock does not work in my area. I tried it in a different location and it works."
4,"it is not perfect, but I do not think there is anything better on the market","It does what it is supposed to do. Accurately displays temperature and humidity inside and outside. The biggest problem is that you can not make it permanently lit so you could see the clock in the darkness. Yes it has projector, but it only works when it is totally dark.Other then that this clock is great."
4,La Crosse Atomic Projection Clock,This is the second clock of this model that we have. It works perfectly and it is a good value for the cost.
4,Good product,"We are happy with it so far. The design is nice, functional: you can get the info at a glance. I would guess the temperature readings are not very accurate, +/- 1 Celsius: when I keep the outdoor sensor next to the unit, the unit shows 1 degree centigrade more than the sensor. We had worse. I guess we'll have to accept that these things will never be as reliable as the liquid based ones.The projection is nice, well readable in the dark. You can adjust the position of the projection by rotating it 90 degrees at a time. It can alternate between the time and the outdoor temperature. Why not the indoor temperature, I wonder; that would be more of interest to me."
4,redeeming film noir,"this little gem could easily be dismissed with myriad other film noirs upon initial viewing. however, it manages to redeem itself when viewed in it's entirety. upon personal research, i discovered it to be part of a trilogy of film noir murder mysteries directed by Otto Preminger. the other 2 being 'Laura' and 'Where The Sidewalk Ends'. despite a rather plodding beginning, the film is a rewarding experience if the viewer has enough patience and appreciation to endure until the end. personally, of the trilogy, i would rate 'Where The Sidewalk Ends' over this one and 'Laura', but this rates a close 2nd. i realize 'Laura' is a favorite with film noir lovers but i still place it last in the trilogy. incidentally though, i own all three.as for the dvd. excellent transfer and sound. recommended."
4,Great Atmospheric FIlm Noir with Dana Andrews,"Excellent atmospheric Film Noir. Great cast Dana Andrews,John Carradine,Alice Faye, Linda Darnell. Dana is looking to marry Alice Faye for her money so he can ultimately leave her for Linda Darnell. But someone who is interested in Linda Darnell kills her because he couldn't have her. I thoroughly enjoyed the mood, the characters & Dana looking for ways to make a lot of money. I found the lack of music very creepy in a good way. Check this one out. Good to watch on a nice cold day with some hot coffee,tea or cocoa :)"
4,Happy Ending Film Noir,"A very slick production, but with Alice Faye and a happy ending it is not realy film noir. Still quite enjoyable."
2,"good book, poor condition",heavily worn and cover was bent and beginning to tear. binding intact. no loose pages.
4,A text for my course,Have not yet read it. Seems appropriate. No more to say and addeing required number of words is silly. so there
3,nice cotton but not so good quality print,it's very nice cotton and i love the packaging. but the print quality is not so great. it seems like iron-on print...it's a cute small gift for anyone who's having a baby.
1,Does this picture contain a typo?,"The picture shows clearly a Bears logo accompanied with 2006 *AFC* Champions... um, guys - ""AFC""??? I would think that the Colts would take umbrage at such a suggestion... On the other hand, if only a few of these hats make it off the shelves they could be a highly collectible ""error"", like the stamps that get printed with the wrong color ink...I will assume that the illustration is just a ""mock-up"" since the text description correctly lists ""NFC""...Or - ???"
5,Monsters Don't Scuba Dive,I am ordering these books for my youngest granddaughter. She loves them. When I got the books they were packed really well. And they got here really quickly. She got interest in them at school. But the school only had a few of them. They don't even have a complete set.
5,Drakkar Noir is my only fragrance.,"Their liquid aftershave doesn't burn and the fragrance is good for me, and frequently noticed by those around me in a very positive way."
5,Han Solo,this is a great toy it is fun and enjoyable to play with. this is an awesome action figure if you don't have one then i recommend you get one.
3,Not for Low Carb Dieters,"I love the Griswolds' tapes like Slim Image 2 and Achieving Your Ideal Weight Automatically. Both are wonderful and very supportive. However, if you are on a low carb diet, this particular tape is not really for you. Excellent for low fat dieters."
2,monotonous,"This is a feel good tape. Too repetitive to listen to for a whole month,Wont help you lose weight but may make you feel better about yourself as you are. Relaxing."
4,This is a great Shaolin Movie!!,"Drunken Monks, Shaolin mixed up in a war plot, an underlying love story that results in mayhem. This movie has a plot, which some said is not existent, and great training and fight sequences. If you want to see a quality kung fu movie then this is one of them. Watch the 13 pole fighters of shaolin and the abott kick some manchu hind section. This movie is a must see!!"
3,Decent Older Style Chop-Sockey,"This DVD is done in the older fight choreography style, where the fighters throw a punch or kick and pause before throwing the next attack. So instead of a series of attacks being done in a 123456 style, it was done as 1-2-3-4-5-6. This is a common older choreography style for low budget kung fu flicks. Some of the non-fighting action is extremely good though, watch for the drunken shaolin monk. The wire work is very subtle for the most part, which is a nice change from the typical movie of this caliber and period.The plot is very loose, and the characterization changes rapidly and without any obvious reasons. However, nobody really watches these types of films for plot or storyline, and the action is good enough to keep you interested."
1,NOT WORTH A CENT,"This book is NOT WORTH A CENT. If I could I would rate it with zero stars. Probably people who gave this book 5 stars were paid to do so (no offence).I read it twice and spent one year training after it. All I got was waisted time and injury.It is horribly incomplete: there are only programs with sets and reps for every routine. The whole book was probably written in one afternoon (terrible language, lack of crucial info.)The book is very expensive; it has 171 pages (but half of it are programs and the other half is how the muscles work).If you want the best book on weight training buy BEYOND BRAWN (over 500 pages of laconic language)for half the price from BBB.Big Beyond Belief is a big deception famous only because of a good comercial."
5,Love this show!!!!!!,"You cannot get funnier than Hank, Wanda and Oscar. This show is just the best if you have not seen it I am sorry because you are missing a really good thing."
3,no subtitles,"Love the show but the description states there are subtitles, and there aren't. Difficult to follow for my hard-of-hearing family. Otherwise, great show!"
1,Beware of the Service!,"The description for the product said "" 3 Piece cushion set."" I received one piece and when I complained they told me that it would be fixed to my satisfaction. It was not! Watch dealing with these people."
1,QUALITY SUCKS,"I ordered this stimulator as a replacement for a previously purchased one, but the quality has gone downhill over the last several years - the material was stuck to itself, to the plastic wrapper, and stuck to my fingers when I took it out of the packaging. Amazon was FANTASTIC in replacing the first one with a new one, but it arrived in the same condition - they graciously refunded my money. The Florida heat during shipping/delivery may have contributed to the problem, but I am surprised it would happen to two delivered in a short period of time. I received one while living in Illinois and it was great - lasted many years and we had many great times."
4,ME LIKE!,"I heard ""Fly Away"" on Live365 's Music That Flows radio station Of course I was like ""Oh, snap! Who is that?"" I knew I had to get this. I'm glad I did. I checked out his bio and come to find out that PJ is a ""PK"", Bishop Paul Morton Sr. 's son. Very cool. Thats why the vibe is so sweet.I really enjoyed PJs CD and having read info on his group's (Freestyle Nation) website, I now realize I recognize his voice from India Arie xtra track, ""Interested"".As I said I really liked ""Fly Away"" but also ""Ordinary Love"" and ""How We Were"". The only minor prob is that all or most of the songs have a VERY ""Stevie Wondery"" vibe and kinda sound the same. But since Im a big Stevie fan, its cool for a first project. All in all this a very sweet, pure, project where the suject matter is love. Oh yeah, I'm definitely gonna pick up the Freestyle Nation CD."
5,"I do not have the words for PJ Morton's ""Emotions""","I have no words for the way that this CD touched my heart; I know you will share my sentiments when you pick it up (hint hint hint). Aptly named, Emotions is a combination of riveting insights into love and sensibility. I commend PJ for realizing that there is a love that exists beyond the fairytale nirvana of bedtime story books. This release should enlighten you to the realities of love's roller-coaster. As fun as the expectations and trepidation can be during the ups, love reminds us that the downs can be equally as intense while just as temporary.This CD will awaken a realization that there is no way you should frivolously end something special over an inevitable and momentary downturn. ""Blah, blah, blah"" seems to sum it up best. When you are asked to describe how your lover makes you feel one should never have the appropriate words. It seems to me that this description should always come out ""like Jiborish""."
1,doesnt work,"this is the second of these i have bought.on the first none of the buttons on the lrft side (1,4,7,etc) were functionalon the secondall the numeric controls work .I can access the menu but not navigate in same."
1,LASTED ONLY A YEAR....,"I bought this item for my Sharp TV model 27K-S100 from partstore.com a year ago for $16.95 (with s&h $26.40). This remote was of very poor quality: even when new the buttons jammed and after a year it stopped working. Now I bought a remote directly from Sharp but it will cost me $33 ($44.31! with s&h). Fooled once shame on you, fooled twice shame on me..."
2,waste of money,"I bought the remote to change the picture size and it did work. Then i tried to do some other adjustments like color and sound and the buttons didnt do anything. Menu button does nothing! The only thing the remote is good for is channel, volume, on/off. It even says when you open it "" NOTE: Not every button will work on every TV ""... Dont waste your time/money."
3,Okay,"The book was recommended by the Gestalt Therapy Institute in California. In all honesty I believe that they are all just trying to get you to buy members of the Gestalt Institutes book because this one really wasn't too great. However, it is easy reading and can be used as bedtime reading material if you are interested."
5,Just excellent!,"Acid Test was a page turner from beginning to end! It started big, ended big, and was big all through the middle. The characters were well-crafted and three-dimensional. They had...well, chemistry. You felt the connection between them. The plot was pretty solid, and he handled the futuristic weapons nicely, integrating today's bleeding-edge tech with tech that's right around the corner. He also gets the computer stuff right (most authors don't) which was outstanding.If you're a fan of Tom Clancy or Clive Cussler, get it. You're going to get all the action and political drama you want - and then some - wrapped in a package that's overall much easier to swallow than your standard Dirk Pitt adventure.If you're not, get it anyway. There's something in here for everybody.Personally, I hope this is the beginning of a series. I could hang out with Matt Wilder more often."
4,a good read,"This is a pretty good read for a thriller. It was a little difficult to keep reading at times. The problem that he presents in medicine is a fascinating problem and that is what captured and kept my attention.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
5,A great action Thriller with humor.,"What a fun read. This book has a great hero, two great villains and more action than the entire Lethal Weapon series. All this, plus a wicked sense of humor. I enjoyed every rapidly turned page."
2,Sloppy Research,Good writing but why the sloppy research? If you're going to write a technothriller do the homework. The Russians do not have battleships and submarines do not return anti-aircraft fire. See pages 81 and 104 for specific examples of goofiness.
2,puhhhhlease,"Wow I think that Ross took some of the same acid the President did. This is so over the top unbelieveable that it turned into a comedy. Lamanna can obviously write, but he has to bring his material back to earth a bit. If you want plausible action, check out Gonzalo Lira's ""Acrobat."" A great story with a great twist and soon to be made into a movie by Miramax."
3,"Entertaining, but not as tight as other authors","It was amusing for the most part, but the ending got a little hoakey, even acknowledging future technology and scientific inflation allowed in fiction. Some facts about OSI are not correct either, even though the author received cooperation from OSI when researching. The poor editing left me a little let down, meaning the book lacks the refinement of other thrillers. It got a little tiring toward the end of the book, and I struggled to get through it after I lost interest. If you like military or international thrillers, but don't mind a few editing mistakes, I think you still will enjoy the book. It just will not be the best book you've read."
1,Disappointing,"As a Coloradon, I was looking forward to the timeless acoustics suggested by the reviews and CD write up. I found the music arrangement & sound dated and similar to low grade 70's rockabilly. I was unimpressed by the vocals also. Would not recommend and will donate this disappointment to a local charity."
1,just plain bad,"I agree with most of the other reviews, this book was horrible. I read the discription on the back of the book and was instantly interested ( being a huge spike fan ) and bought it. but I was very disapointed, the whole thing is just flash backs that come directly from the show and the autor didnt add anything. I would rather just watch the show!!! Plus the flash backs are out of order, leaving you confused. DON'T BUY THIS BOOK, YOU WILL REGRET IT."
3,Didn't Go Far Enough,"I bought this in the hopes that it would be a continuation of the story as ended in the last episode of ANGEL, but it stopped long before that. If we're going to have novels based in the Buffy/Angel universe, they need to carry the story forward, not just rehash things that went on during the series. Also, we need stories aimed a little higher than the ""teen reader"" level. Some of us fans are ADULTS!"
5,Spark and Burn,"Loved the delve into the mind of my favorite character. Working around what was already done for Season 7 and previous must've been difficult at times, but Diana Gallagher did an excellent job! Don't wanna give anything away, but the newly revealed history of Spike as well as his take on previous Buffy-verse events was great! Definately worth it."
4,awesome book... but kinda lacking,"I <3 the character of Spike so just the cover gets you into it. Overall this was a great book. It gives a lot of information on Spike's background and past life. I love how it goes into different times, but also it's a bit jumpy. It is constantly switching between years and unless you know a lot about the episodes it can be kind of confusing. Also I was kind of expecting something better, like more of a story, not history. I thought that there was going to be more added to the episodes. Other than that it's a great book for Spike fans."
3,Boring and Depressing,"This book rehashes info from the show, no new material, and is depressing in that the Spike character acts more like Angel in his depressed, regretful view (one reason I'm not crazy about Angel. To mopey.) It may be important to visit this topic for character development, but the epi on tv was enough. It would be nice to have some fiction that tells Spike's story after ""Angel"", maybe with some Spuffy love."
2,"I love Spike, but not this","I LOVE Spike. But I did not love this book. There was nothing new in it. There was only recap after recap of all the major episodes Spike was in. I would have been happy if we got even a little bit of extra insight or detail or perspective from even just a few of those scenes, but we didn't. Very disappointed."
1,No spark and it burns me that I bought it!,"As with many others, I was instantly captured by the thought of ""an original novel"" for one of my favorite Buffy characters, Spike. This book, however, is pretty much just a recap of everything known from the show. The only really original part is how Spike ended up on the Nazi submarine. Otherwise, the author rambled on about Spike's origins and repeated unoriginal themes from the show. And, personally, I did not appreciate her using Spike's supposed involvement in the other Buffy story lines (such as those about Machida and Ampata, the mummy) to fill her pages. He was not in those stories, don't bring him in now just to take up space. I have great reverence for books and can count the number of times in my life that I have destroyed a book on purpose -- this will be number 3."
3,Too much time rehashing the series,"When I buy a novel based on a television show, I either want a copy of the show or something very new. Frankly I'm guessing that the amount of truly new material in this book is under 50% thus the 3 of 5 stars. Oh, I suppose it is interesting to get into Spike's head but how difficult was that in the series? I really was hoping for more insight into why he is so strongly attracted to Buffy, the fight for his soul and his fight to reclaim his sanity after he gets it back. Far too much time was spent in the book on the events of season two to satisfy me."
5,This one is a PROMISE to be a good one,"PROMISE, ENEMY, and HERE'S TO THE NIGHT are some of this band's best yet but you have to here them for yourself."
2,Uninspired Punk Pop,"Too be perfectly honest I bought this because on a whim. I’de heard of them as a “punk band” and Ive heard “Promise” on the radio. When I saw the cover (which is great) I figured what the hell. I popped it into my CD player and was disappointed. This isn’t punk. This is nice processed pop, sorry, but its true. And yet…there are a couple of good songs. “Here’s to the night” would be my favorite. Most likely because I can relate to it, and it truly is a moving song. Amphetamines is like the only punk song on the album and it is good. The rest is…blah blah…. I don’t really want to give this 2 stars. Its in between 2 and 3 only slightly worse than the average alnum. But its closer to 2 than 3 so what the heck."
3,This is really 3.5 stars....,"I tried my hardest to like this album. After blowing 13 hard earned bucks on this, I wanted this to be chock-ful of happy easy to digest songs (this was following my APC/At the Drive in binge) but it's not. The first four songs are cool, but other than that, it's a REAL mixed bag. The songs are a little to identical, and after a while, you find yourself listening to a handful of the tracks. I bought this about three months ago, but honestly, I haven't cared to listen to it since last week. I may sound harsh, but actually, I really do like, but if you're in the mood for something light, look to some artists like Wheatus, and even the new Dave Matthews cd."
5,Another One,"Another great release from eve 6. Escaping the jinx of sophmore releases (a lot of the time second cd's aren't quite as good for some reason) it's as good as the first one. At first I didn't like is quite as much, but the lyrics are still deep and intellient. And the music is awesome. They're such a good band. Buy this CD, and the self titled, NOW."
5,Horrorscope is En Fuego,"Max, Tony, and Jon and members of RCA records have done an outstanding job with Horrorscope. This is the first cd i can put in my cd player and let it play all the way through. Not only does each beat rock, but listen to the lyrics and it will blow you away. Every week I acquire a new favorite song on the cd. Buy it for yourself and determine which song blows your hair back...."
4,Another Great Album!,Horroscope is a really good album! the lyrics are so catchy and the guitar is amazing. Their first single off the album ''promise'' is my favorite track. This is what I expected when I listened to the first album but Horrorscope is much better. I recommend this album to everyone it ROCKS!
3,"Not bad. Quite good, even.","The songwriting is a little bit dodgy ('your heinous highness broke her hymen' or how about 'Like Jessica Rabbit/She collects bad habits') but there's an abundance of mad riffs and if nothing else this album snags you with it's shamelessy catchy melodies. Remember their breakthrough hit of 1998, Inside Out'? There's plenty more of that here. My favourite moment here though, is the sighing balladry of 'Here's To The Night'. A simply beautiful song, there should have been more like it on the album."
5,this is the best cd IN THE WORLD!!!!!,"i love the first album but this.... its just..wow...its a mixture of blink182, lit and green day all mixed together and the result is amazing, all the songs one the album are brilliant without sounding the same, there are three slowish songs which i usually fast forward but eve6 have even pulled that off! this album has made them my favourite band and i cant wait to see more of it,the songs are so catchy! i cant imagine anyone not liking this especially if you liked the first one and other similar bands-BUY IT!!!!!"
5,EVE 6 AVIODS THE SOPHOMORE SLUMP,"ahh, the sweet sounds of eve 6...not! nope, not anymore even though their last album was overflowing with great punk and a a new sound that made the offspring look like kathie lee gifford. im not saying the guys have turned to speed metal or anything, but the lyrics are a little nastier (rubs hands together and grins), yet not too raunchy. its hard to believe these guys are barely out of high school and selling platinum albums, having billboard hits (ahem, who can forget inside out), and writing two albums of catchy, unique songs. worth every penny. go buy it!"
4,pretty good,"This cd is good, but not great. All of the songs are completely different, which is why i gave it a 4, not 5. Some of the songs i absolutely love, but others I cant stand. All in all, this is a good cd, definitely worth the money."
4,EVE 6 matures with new album,"If anyone out there heard eve 6's first album and liked it, you will not be disappointed by their new release, Horrorscope. The album is full of singable choruses and catchy guitar hooks. The production on Horrorscope mixes electronic keyboard sounds with powerful guitar that creates for a full, dynamic sound. Eve 6 has a knack for writing songs about how every guy feels, and have also seem to come a long way on their instruments. Their sound is just technically better on this album. I also like the album art concept of a superheroine, which is sung about in the song ""rescue"". Other gems include ""promise"" and ""enemy""."
4,even better than the first,"a very good cd. this is one of my favorite bands. this cd is like the 1st but better. there is plenty of great sound efects and as always sweet lyrics. the songs are all catchy. if you have the first cd and liked it, for sure go out and get this one too. if you do not have the 1st cd, get both."
2,"Freshman album was much, much better","What a disappointment. Eve 6's debut album was quite good, but this album blows. Inside Out basically sold the first CD, and the rest was surprisingly good; unfortunetly, there's not much past Here's To The Night. The chords sound the same on almost every song, and the melodies are non-existant. The first album really worked and sounded great, but this just plain stinks.2 stars for Here's To The Night - the one listenable song on here."
2,Here is some pop rock.,"It's kind of sad that a band thinks horrorscope is a funny pun. Eve6 doesnt really bring anything new to rock, but it's one of those things that really doesn't get out of your head. This record is like the little doggy who sees you on the street and follows you around and you like it for a while. Then it poops all over the house and you get sick of it."
3,Not an album band anymore,"After hearing Eve 6's debut i had high hopes about a punk band that wouldn't become tied down by modern commercialism. My hopes were drowned with the release of this crap. NOt even kidding, there are 3 good songs. The rest seem to fade into boredom the minute they start. One problem these guys siriously have is the lyrics; they are not very good songwriters. What is good is the 3 songs that are good are really good; how can a band make such good songs then plummit into garbage. How is that possible. Kind of like u2's new album: that's another story so never mind. Anyways I'd suggest to anyone who's asking, this album won't leave an imprint on your mind; it's too ordinary. check out the debut instead."
5,NEVER GETS OLD!!!,I LOVE this CD! My friend burned it for me and I listened to it all the time. It seemed to always fit my mood. It always moves me. The music and the singers voice really vibrate within you and you can't help but want to rock out in your car while you have the sterio up as loud as it can go!!! IT DOES ROCK!!!!
4,Fantasic jam music.,"While not typically a fan of ""pop"" music, this album's cover attracted me. I have been absolutley satisfied in buying this album. The music is fun, engergetic, and great to have booming in your car while on a long work commute.I really didn't understand the ""explicit lyrics"" tag. Its simply not that bad, and undeserved. The lyrics you hear are nothing worse than an episode of LAPD Blue, or the Spawn cartoon.Great job Eve6, hope to hear more like this from you!"
2,What was THAT!?,"Anyone who has heard Eve 6's fist CD will agree with me that the vocaling is strong. They sacrifice the attention in Horrorscope for more focus on their not quite up to par guitar skills. The first three tracks are really good (Rescue, Promise, On the roof again) but the rest of the CD leaves a lot to be desired.simple rythms with a vocal barley being understood just takes all the fun out of Eve 6, turn me inside out anytime."
1,Generic Unoriginal Artists Please Apply,"I won't need 1,000 words for this one. These guys will force a new evolution in music because they are unoriginal, generic garbage. As the masses conform to the modern standard of todays music, the true artists will push the envelope and lead the evolution into the future. These sorry nothings will just blend in like the many before them. Good work guys, you're a big part of the evolution of music. The only problem is you won't be able to breathe the new air in 5 years. You'll be dead by then."
3,Not a bad follow,"Well, the follow from Eve 6's debut wasn't bad. Some songs I can't stand like ''Rescue'' and ''On the roof again'' but the other songs were smart, fast, and had that punk touch to them. Over all this album was pretty good."
5,This cd is killer,"I'm an all rock fan, i like all forms of rock. mostly metal and punk, but recently i heard Think Twice on the radio, and me being stupid like this, I went out and got Horrorscope thinking that was on it, but this whole cd is way better than i thought it would be. The best tracks would have to be Bang, and Amphedamines, and Promise. But the whole album is definitely A+ material. Buy this cd, these guys aren't like any new music. And since the whole punk image has become a new trend, this album could be mistaken as one that follows this trend, but look at the release date people, Overall, buy it, you'll love it I'm sure."
2,Not Worth the Price,"There's only 50 puzzles on the CD, so that is disappointing considering the price you pay. Although you can break it down into 5000+ pieces, I would have liked more variety. I had one CD a while ago that had 1000 puzzles on it, although I think you were limited to max 1000 pieces .... but at least you had a big variety and lots of themes to choose from. I'll sometime dig through my boxes to see if I can find those CDs and hope they will work with Windows 8."
3,Jigsaw,Well it was a present for Brother IN Law and he said he liked it and had fun putting it together
5,Older interpretation,I found this book written before all the Left Behind Hullabuh to be very refreshing and straigt forward. There seems to be more interpretation using the Bible rather than other authors as much as the more recent books on Revelation. I found it as a reference in another older commentary and was pleased that I found this one. I have more tabs in this book for points to use in teaching than any of the other books I have recently (in last year) purchased.
5,Perfect for travel,I love this size for traveling!!! Wish every large bottle came with a small one like this. I have a few different kinds in this size and I love them. It's also great if you want to try out a smell
2,A Terrible Disappointment,"Especially in comparison to the brilliance of the first two installments, this was a bitter disappointment. Rumor has it that those involved would only do the third installment if the evil king received his come-uppance, and he does here, in an unsatisfactory manner, unbefitting the evil he once wrought. It's hard to imagine that a grown man who fed rat poison to an inconvenient party functionary, threw a lover off the top of the House of Commons, and car bombed up another in front of her husband, would be tortured for a second by having killed a boy in (Cyprus civil) wartime. The motive force in this one strains credulity. Watch and enjoy the first two, but skip this one- it really does not conclude the career of F.U. as the same imagination that brought the first two installments to life would have,"
2,they should have stopped...,"... with ""To Play the King"".While Mr. Dobbs was not amused to have part one changed to a happy end for evil - yes, with FU anything is possible! - he still wrote a sequel which was much better on screen than off.Sadly, this is not the case with ""The Final Cut"". The book is full of info on Urquart's background and motives which are totally lacking in the film.Plus, of course, Shakespearean references: Richard III baptised part one, Macbeth laid the foundation for part two, and part three echoes Julius Caesar... for which there is little evidence in the film. The book gives us FU's version of the funeral speech, spoken, as it were, -sic!- our own Caesar himself BEFORE his assassination. (Greetings to Garofano and his rather harebrained theory)In the book FU is still up to the mark, not some tottering old fool as he is portrayed in the film. It hurt to see Richardson, the mature but springy scheemer reduced to such inefficiency."
5,Grand finale,"In this, the third and final part of the series of The House of Cards, Ian Richardson as Prime Minister, Francis Urquhart, is almost bored as PM as he has achieved all that he set out to do, corrupting a large portion of the parliament and plunging the country into two distinct sides of ""haves"" and ""have nots"". Never before in Britain have there been streets filled with homeless and desperate people whom Francis percieves as being little more than animals. The limits to which this man will go are beginning to cause even his evil wife to question his sanity and the denouement is breathtaking in it's intensity...definitely a must see."
2,Sterling Silver Three Bangle Bracelet Set,"I am very disappointed in this product! There is a piece added on the inside of one of the bangles which is very sharp and scratches my arm. All of the bangles have cracks on the ""silver"" which is supposedly identified on the above-mentioned added piece. I did appreciate the information that the bangles were connected. I would not order from this vendor again."
1,bangle,"/It was a good price, I had look everywhere for one, however it was not! as advertized it look like a toy went it can and did not fit even a ten year old.I returned this bangle last week and have not! got credit back on my card yet. If the product is returned promptly then so should the money be returned quickly. First thing from Amazon that I have ever gotten and I was happy with. Roxann /1-9-2013"
4,Plaid Napkins,So happy I found these. I bought 5 in a local store by mistake & really needed 6. I used the coordinating ones in bread baskets & the look was perfect!
1,Towards a Christian Architecture,"This is a book exclusively for Christians, particularly those Christians who are certain that only Christians can contribute to the improvement of the world. ""I want to argue that the built environment relates to every area of Christian ethics, and that only a Trinitarian ethic, an ethic of creation, reconciliation, and redemption, is adequate to explore it,"" writes the author (p. 5). If you are looking for an architectural ethics that will help you think about how the built landscape contributes to social justice or impedes it, how structures interact with their builders and occupiers, how buildings may be dangerous or protective, this is not the right book to read. If, however, you are a fervent Christian who would like to see how your religious views may be imposed on architecture along with all other expressions of social life, here is the text for you."
2,Combat Aircraft since 1945 Book review,The book had a library catalog tag on the inside of the book behind the cover.The book is somewhat outdated.
4,A Seperate Disc For Each Artist,"The track listing for the CD set is as follows:Disc 1: Connie Francis1) All By Myself, 2) Among My Souvenirs, 3) Blame It On My Youth, 4) Breakin' In A Brand New Broken Heart, 5) Come Rain Or Come Shine, 6) Everybody's Somebody's Fool, 7) Follow The Boys, 8) Frankie, 9) Hallelujah, I Love Him So, and 10) Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me.Disc 2: Perry Como1) A Garden In The Rain, 2) Because, 3) Dig You Later, 4) I Dream Of You, 5) I Wonder Who's Kissing Her Now, 6) If I Loved You, 7) I'm Always Chasing Rainbows, 8) I'm Confessin' That I Love You, 9) I'm Gonna Love That Gal, and 10) More Than You Know."
1,Not Cost Effective Reading!,"There is no way I would pay 575 dollars for this book! Has anyone out there?! I do not doubt that information is a valuable resource, in fact I truly believe that it is, but come on! 575 dollars????"
3,okay book,"This book is just all right. It seems very short for the price that you pay, so the value isn't quite there. It also has a slightly generic feel. The information seems a little to broad and probably could've used some more tailoring. There definitely is a better book than this if you're preparing for your interview!"
3,Thought it'd be better...,"I'm a big fan of Ms. De Angelis work, and I'm not saying that this tape is bad. However, I didn't expect it to be a recorded lecture that she once gave. I already own ""Secrets about Life every woman should know"" on audiocassette, and it's a completely different format. There you have a summary of the book, not a conversation. Also, the quality is better. This one sounds recorded by a cassette player. I wish I'd known what kind of cassette it was before buying it. I was expecting more content and structure and less dialogue with an audience."
3,Lots of memories; commentaries weak,"The release of these DVDs brings back some great memories; however, I was let down a bit by Marlo's commentaries. I realize that, forty years on, she has quite a body of work behind her; yet, as a fan you wait to hear such things as, ""I remember this scene!,"" or ""Ted Bessell broke up during the shooting of this scene..."", but she speaks about Ann Marie in the 3rd person, occasionally pointed out some dresses she liked, or that, ""Teddy Bessell was so thin then."" Her commentaries seem to suggest she has no independent recollection of the shows, so in that sense it will be a let down for fans and you may question the value of the commentaries."
5,WHAT A GIRL!,"I always loved this show and am thrilled it's finally out in DVD....I'm anxiously awaiting the last season - Season 5.Marlo was what every girl wanted to be - gorgeous, with a wardrobe to kill for, a great apartment, a fabulous boyfriend and an exciting career. Ann Marie was way ahead of her time and a real icon."
4,Marlo's funniest moments,"That Girl: Season ThreeMarlo Thomas shines in this series with some of her best episodes. Memories of the 60s flight hijackings to Cuba are hilariously recreated by Ann Marie as a stewardess enroute to Miami. Her personal classic which includes her brother Tony, her sister Terry, and her renown father Danny Thomas alone make this episode alone worth keeping. Lew Parker continues to shine as Ann's overprotective father against her boyfriend Don and also Broadway stars like Barry Sullivan. The classic ""Monopoly"" game is in this series with Mr. Marie obsessed with Don throughout a Broadway show in securing Marvin Gardens. This is well worth the investment. Enjoy wholesome comedy with Marlo Thomas as That Girl!"
5,Essential Barfield,"Poetic Diction is Barfield's earliest exposition of his thought, and contains in germ many of the ideas that would blossom in later works. It should appeal especially to students and lovers (not to mention writers) of literature. Barfield begins with his observations in reading poetry, which lead eventually to a wholly new understanding of meaning, consciousness, and the importance of poetry. His conclusions are far-reaching and especially important in an age that undervalues the humanities."
2,Disappointing,"I can't say that I'm overly impressed with this textbook. If I weren't a Japanese major and didn't need to take the class that requires this book, I'd probably have thrown it away long before now. The use of romaji throughout the entire book is very annoying and the way the grammar points are set up doesn't make them memorable at all. I've been in Japanese 201 since late August and have yet to learn anything new. I previously took 101 and 102 using the Yookoso textbook, which I thought was wonderful and I miss it dearly."
1,Absolutely Horrid,"I don't know where to begin... I came from a high school where we used the Genki Text and went off to college to be placed in a class below my level which used this text book. This text is horrifying, first off the romanization of the Japanese words is just plain peculiar and they don't even use the kana or kanji in this text (how you learn to read Japanese through this method I do not know). The method through which they present the material is awful as well. I have this monstrosity because I'm in a class that it's a required text for, but if you have a choice I recommend the Genki test from The Japan Times."
1,Worst Japanese Textbook,"I was in a class using this book. It was awful. The romanization was useless in teaching proper pronunciation, and also made it difficult to read. Despite having ""drill sessions"" in the class, my classmates struggled with pronunciation because of this textbook.I finally chose to wait until a better class, and a better book, came along. I have been in a class where they used a different textbook, and that was far more productive because of it.Save your money."
1,Worst of the Worst,"Don't use this book. Jordan's system is counterproductive to the Japanese learner, and everyone I've known to be really successful in Japanese swear off this system. Try the ""Genki"" series instead."
2,There have to be better choices than this,"Of all the wine books in my collection, this is the only one I just cannot bring myself to read or study. It is poorly laid out and difficult to use as a ready reference, and it is not good reading to use for pure recreational or educational reading. I pick it up from time to time thinking that the layout will become comfortable for me if I persist, but it does not, and I do not. It has neither the straightforward reference style of Hugh Johnson's Pocket Wine Guides nor the fabulous reading and educational style of Parker's Bordeaux."
4,The best TV-movie... If for fans of REMEMBER THE TITANS,"I saw this movie on HALLMARK and was suprised how good it was, normally HALLMARk-movies are really cheesy and quite corny but this one was actually very good.It's a true story just like REMEMBER THE TITANS and if you liked that one u will probably like this as well.I'm probably gonna buy the dvd if it goes down in prices becouse the TV-version I have recorded on VHS has all the cussing cut out, and in some scenes words those are very necessary like for instance when the little brother of SIRR gets asked how he feels by an neighbour and he replies with a cussword that's cut out and she gets mad.SIRR lives in the ghetto where most of his friends are part of Gang-activity they encourage him to not follow their footsteps and use his talent of football instead... It's a heartwarming TV-movie, Yes SIRR this is a good movie."
4,good product,"The service is fast, I recieved my product in less than a week. Also, I purchased it used but you would not know it because the quality was great!"
2,A disappointment,"My first exposure to grammatrain was their second album, Flying, which I consider to be a masterpiece for its creativity and unbelievable energy. This first album is nowhere near as good. I found it to be monotonous, although it contains a lot of the same themes as Flying, the music is a disappointment."
1,Are you Kidding me?,"Bottom line up front, if you are looking for venezuelan music, this is not what you want. As a true venezuelan music fan (for years now) I have seen many imitations, but get real! Try hitting some of the local music distributers or venezuelan arits displayed at the begining of the search, those are decent."
3,Interesting San Francisco film noir,The House on Telegraph Hill is a tautly directed film noir set mostly in San Francisco around 1950. It gains interest from a lot of location shots of the city of that time. Recommended for those interested in film noir or in San Francisco films. Decent quality transfer on the 2006 DVD.
4,Almost a great movie !!,"""The House on Telegraph Hill"" had the making of a great movie, but the beginning and middle of the movie have some real dead spots with a lot of unnecessary talking.Richard Basehart does a fantastic job as the dedicated, yet greedy husband who will do anything for $$$$ !It was not until the very end I really knew if he was evil or innocent!Way to many interior scenes in the fake house and the film would have been much better with the use of the beautiful San Francisco area !"
2,Painful to watch,I have decided to watch the movie because of all the five star reviews so now I feel that I have to contribute my opinion. From my point of view all actors in this movie are badly overacting. All emotions are exaggerated to ridiculous levels. Maybe that was the norm at the time the movie was made. Now combined with relatively slow pace and linear plot it makes the movie painful to watch.
3,"Flawed movie, great acting","This could have been a great movie, unfortunately, it has too many underdeveloped situations, ideas. Also, I found the female protagonist (Valentina Cortese) neither beautiful non particuliarly charming. I got this movie because Richard Basehart is in it, and I wasn't dissapointed at all. Check the last 10 minutes, it's a lesson on subtle yet effective acting! I just can't understand why this marvelous actor is so under rated!"
5,It's the stuff!,"I also work as an automotive technician, and I'm jealous. I don't have one yet, but six of the guys in the shop do.I have a mini mag light with an LED and it runs off of 2 AA batteries. After a few hours the batteries on my light are dead enough to have a falling effect to the quality of the light. Also, my light doesn't have the output. When I have someone look at something with me, I can't even see my light if their light is in the same spot.I'm either going to get this one (like I said six guys have them) or I'm going to get the one with the Li-ion battery. It's smaller and lighter."
2,Nickel Cadium in 2008?!,"Hi. I love these High performence torches but I don't understand why it uses the more enviromental unfriendly Nickel Cadium batteries. Although it's rechargeble I would buy it, if it would have been Nickel Metal instead.Pelle."
1,When is Cop Killing appropropriate? NEVER,"I bought this for grandson. He loves the Transformers. HOWEVER... its main theme seems to be killing cops. In a world where guns are a bit too available, why would we teach our kids to kill the authority figure which should be the ""good guys""? We put the game away and bought him another game, tho I don't know why we are saving the wretched thing.I would definitely put this game on the Do NOT BUY list."
5,transfromer autobots,I recommend you play Transformers Autobots. It's a good game but Assassinn Creed is a better one. Also it's an awesome movie to me & it's cool to be an autobots sometimes. Get this it's a good game . Transformers is the best.
5,Happy Customer,Product came as promised and was exactly what my child wanted. Very happy with purchase and shipping!
3,Fun Game- but WiFi access no longer supported,"FYI as of August 1, 2009 the WiFi function on this game is no longer supported by Nintendo DS Lite per [...]Support. The game itself is great fun. So buy it for the game without expectations of online WiFi access as it's no longer available."
5,Loved it!,"You can scan lots of cars, change cars whenever you want, blow stuff up & beat-up lots of decepticons."
2,Poor Game,"This game was pretty simple and got boring quickly. The level of detail in the game was about equivalent to the games I played as a young kid on the original nintendo, and the plots were quite repetetive: go find this and kill it, go protect this, get here, etc.It was about transformers and it was fun to be able to transform into cool cars and even a helicopter, but I got bored with the game very quickly and never finished it. It might be alright for young kids who loved the movie, but it would take a young kid to not see through the repetitiveness of the missions."
3,Transformers Autobots,"If your into detailed graphics, this isn't the game for you. But if you like the idea of being a transformer and doing missions, etc for the fun of it ,you may like this game. Its a simple game my toddler plays. So if your a transformers fan you just might like the fact that you can transform into a car,truck, etc."
2,it 's realy hard game,i am only 16% in the game. you have to chase barricade arond intill you have to fight him and you are bumblebe.
1,Boring,"This is a terrible game. It is boring and difficult to control. The storyline is terrible, the online play is terrible and the graphics are sub-par. Fan of Transformers or not; this game is bad."
1,In a better world maybe...,"This book assumes you do not have a spouse who wants nothing other than to cut off your balls and take everything you've got and/or that she is willing to act with some degree of rationality. Well...guess what. That is simply not the case all the time. Maybe if I had the sense to start my divorce several years earlier, it would have been possible to utilize the very sensible advice in this book. Unfortunately, this advice was of no practical benefit in my situation and no amount of understanding or common sense on my part would have changed the situation.Good luck to anyone in this situation. I screwed myself in a number of ways by thinking my soon to be ex-spouse would react rationally and favorably if I only acted sensibly and fairly."
4,Common Sense Yes,"This book has been an excellent guide to what it is titled for. A ""common Sense"" aproach to divorce. Not every divorce needs a lawyer, many want to keep the lawyers out of their affairs. This book game me insight as to what is going on in my life, my kids, and my former spouse. I come back to it and re-read chapters. If you yelling and screaming at each other, or you have ""lawyered up,"" you will not get as much out of this book as those who are tryingto remain in control and do what is best for you and the kids. I recommend it do all men who ask themselves ""what do I do now."""
3,Battery is fine but no acid came with it,"Battery was received in good order, but did not include any acid. It should be noted somewhere that acid is sold separately when necessary. Other batteries we've received came with acid."
1,"Pointless, wordy, and rambling","I wanted to enjoy this book--the subject of modern downsizing fascinates and compels me and there's been a number of solid books recently on the subject...but this isn't one of them. I was misled into believing that on THIS topic, at least, Sennett would be more clear and easier to understand than in those previous books of his which I've read and found highly incomprehensible. His case studies are sketchy, his conclusions are cliched, and his ultimate point is lost in obscurity. Instead, try reading Barbara Rudolph's ""Disconnected"" for a more personal, accessible look at the subject."
1,A retread of socialistic class warfare nostrums.,"I was expecting a reasoned approach which discussed the changes that people face in today's work environment and perhaps some insight into how one could cope with these changes. After all, the author is a sociologist. Alas, I found a rather critical and inaccurate screed which criticizes the business model of the United States and longs for the ""Rhinish"" model of socialism which dominates Europe. I became doubtful of the accuracy of the author's facts when he directly contradicts Peter Drucker on the subject of the reemployment rates of displaced workers. The sources quoted are generally leftist, and the bias is rather appalling. It is therefore not what I would consider a scholarly piece of work, and I would reccomend it only if you are interested in reading about Marxian class-struggle theory."
3,Should have been better.,"This should have been a better book. It focuses too much on downsizing (which is important, but is a different topic) and not enough on how actual people experience work inside corporations. I don't really disagree with anything Sennett says, but would like a richer insight into how people are actually working these days. Fear of layoffs is part of it, but how work today impacts people socially and psychologically is equally important. I'd recommend Lilian Rubin'sWorlds of Pain: Life in the Working-Class Familyas one example of the kind of rich insight I'm talking about. Her book is out of date, but is still exemplary of how to do social/cultural work. Sennett caught the theory bug, which is alarming. Stay focused on what real people say, not what theorists say."
2,Melancholy cliches; no practical solutions,"Even Richard Sennett can't avoid every cliche of the downsizing literature: the father who toiled at honest, meaningful janitor's work; the successful symbolic analyst son filled with insecurity; the bakers who watch machines and ""don't know how to make bread."" The psychological insights come from a sample of two (no kidding): the owner of the bar where Sennett used to drink, and a guy he sat next to on an airplane. And there are no positive or practical solutions to be had. For that, readers can go to Stephen Herzenberg, John Alic, & Howard Wial, New Rules for a New Economy: Employment and Opportunity in Postindustrial America (1998)--and skip Sennett."
4,Good intro to some ideas,"The straight dope on this book is that it is an engaging series of well written essays. The fact that the ideas presented in the book are big ideas makes the terse nature of the book a little incongruous - but that's okay because there are tomes of social science research journals out there is that is what you prefer. Check out the other reviews from readers. People love it or hate it. If you want complete research on the ills of the current strain of capatilism, there are plenty of other enormous works out there. If you want an intro to how the current work world is affecting society, start with this book. Even if hate it and gripe about time you wasted on it, you won't waste much time because this is a quick read."
4,Good Critique On American Society,"I think this book had a few gems of truth. The one thing I didn't like about the book was that it seemed not to flow smoothly. Sometimes I was lost in the different stories in the book. What I really liked was the critique on American society's obession with information, but hunger for truth. The book ends strong with an essay that reflects on the danges of relativism. I believe it is a good book to listen to relevant analysis of our time."
5,Extraordinary,"I bought this after wandering into a music shop in Santa Monica on a trip to LA. WOW. It's my favorite album to play on a warm summer night driving with the convertible top down. I couldn't count how many times I have listened to this Cd - it never grows old. Technically excellent, yes -but also an extraordinary collection of passionate, expressive music."
4,Excellent,Every once in a while I buy a CD that I have to listen to over and over. This is one of those. Its a beautiful recording.
4,Very Nice Watch,"I bought this watch for my husband and he really liked it. The only thing not perfect was the size of the watch face...its enormous, but it doesn't look like it would be in the picture. Other than that, the quality is excellent and it looks great!"
1,Disappointed,"We researched firepits for a while to find the right one. We saw a few advertisements for this one, all of them pictured it with the ceramic log and stated in its advertising that it was included with the firepit. We loved the idea of having a propane fire pit that had the look of an actual wood burning one. Unfortunately the advertising for this product is misleading and untrue as it does not come with the ceramic log OR the advertised marble insert it also advertises as coming with the piece. We attempted to rectify this with both the store we purchased it through (it wasn't amazon) as well as the company that manufactured it. Both have responded with ""Sorry it just doesn't come with it."" We feel completely let down and disappointed with our purchase as well as the service from the company and distributers. Keep looking and find a reputable company who honestly advertises their products...this is not the one."
5,Firelight ambiance,"Nicely sized and sturdy, this fire pit adds a touch of warmth to summer evenings. The top is big enough to put drinks on and the ""stone"" sides are realistic. The propane tank even fits underneath, out of sight.The only drawbacks are that it doesn't come with logs and the fire itself is a round, low (about 4"") flame. Surprisingly, it does let off a little heat. No worries about sparks that could cause a secondary fire or having to put another log on.Great choice if you want to sit by the fire, roasting marshmallows and relaxing."
5,A GREAT ALBUM-ONE OF MY FAVORITES,"I have been listening to this album for 20 or so years now and I still love it. It really touches your soul at times. Another favorite of mine from Eberhard Weber is ""Following Morning"". I sure hope it comes out on CD someday, it is also excellent! Eberhard takes you through many moods."
1,Used Version,"Although the music was essentially vey good, it exceptionally hard to listen to because of a tremendous amount of skips. It is a very poor copy. Enough said."
4,Other Books,"After the author of the Colditz story hightailed it out of the facility there were still men left imprisoned there.In this books he talks about those left behind, and what happened and went on there until the end of the second world war, and the need for the prison was gone."
5,hyms that inspire,thye cd arrived on time and in great shape. i enjoyed listening to songs that i remember as a child.
4,A Great Chess Companion,"Designed for the chess lover in need of a challenge! Chessmaster 6000 provides hours of pleasure. Although it is ideal for intermediate to veteran players, beginners can learn to play with the wealth of tutorials. The best bet is to have someone teach you the very basics, then use CM6000 to hone your skills.CM6000 provides ""personalities"" (complete with photos and bios!) of various skill, ability, and style for hours of challenge. Of course, the masters, like Fischer and Spassky, as well as the Chessmaster himself, are present and accounted for.As with other incarnations of CM, the chessboards (ranging from traditional to contemporary and beyond) are beautifully rendered.Overall, Chessmaster 6000 is very well worth it to any Mac gamer in search of a good game of chess, or just wanting to learn more about the game."
1,Not Much of an Improvement,"This game is not for the serious chess enthusiast. If you enjoy a challenging match, you may be better off playing a three-year old than purchasing this game. If you already have another version of this game, like 2000, stick with it!"
4,Good single from a growing band...,"Being from Nashville, I've had a chance to see this band a few times. This single is a strong improvement from their first. It is tighter, and has a more distinctive sound. I expect big things from them..."
5,Best workout available,"This is the best workout DVD available, in my opinion. I have done Insanity, which is fantastic but definitely not for beginners, P90X, which is ok, and Weider X Factor ST, which is Insanity Lite. The functional training aspect of this DVD program is what makes it better than Insanity or P90X.Don't let the 25 minute long workout fool you! I felt more wiped out after 25 min of this than 70 min of P90X! You'll get the fat loss with muscle definition. The only reason I was able to do an insanity workout without dying is because I had finished the 8 week Rushfit program. The price is definitely worth it. I cannot recommend this product any higher. Buy it and if you honestly give it 100% of your effort, you won't be disappointed."
4,Excited to get it,"Good information for training and balance but the DVD is in parts. Warm-up, Session and Cool-down is in segments and doesn't smoothly transition. I like GSP and his willingness to share his knowledge and admit his challenges is just awesome, such a great guy. The brochures based on activity level is good as well as the information guide but wish the DVD was finished better."
4,its a really exsauhsting workout,i recommend this product to athletic people its really difficult for heavier or nonathletic people.i dont think its worth the price but my husband seems to love it so whatever make him happy
4,Better than expected,"I'm no fan of MMA but thought it would make a great workout. I was skeptical at first but it mixes things up a lot and is not too difficult. In fact, I thought it might be a little too easy as I workout a lot, but it sneaks up on you and is a better workout than you may think."
5,awesome workout,im 41 years old i have been working out with weights since i was 12 faithfully with good results. I found myself gettin bored with lifting heavy weights all the time i heard about rushfit bein that im a mma fan decided to give it a try this workout will get you in shape fast and the workouts dont take forever to do. Plus the workouts are fun and george will keep u entertained. I thought i was in shape when i started i puked several times the first few weeks The program is great for anyone but people with years of working out will find it to be a welcomed change. It works get it.
3,Rushfit Review,"The program is ok, but not spectacular, If you are looking at a program for cardio workouts, this is not the program for you. Its a good use of dumbbells for the strength training, but again could be more intense."
3,Workout Ok,Not a bad program. Seems to start a little tough if you are out of shape like I was. IT did give me motivation to pursue my own program. Would recommend to anyone in good shape that wants to get better.
5,Who would you rather be GEORGE ST PIERRE or TONY HORTON?,ID rather be GSP - I have done p90x and rushfit. rushfit by far is the better workout - I love everything about it - I say if you are thinking about getting this DO IT !!!!
3,Rushfit,"you get your heart rate up, not much work with dumbells, using body weight. Good alternative or addition to 90x or supreme 90. We plan to add this into the mix as it does provide good variety."
3,good for beginners,"It is a good starting workout. After doing P90x, Insanity, and Asylum this does not make me breathe hard or sweat enough for my taste! It does include more strength training than Insanity and the workouts are not as long. commercials make it look hard core. Disappointed as it is not."
1,"If you like the insanity, p90x, chalean extreme, you won't like this","I've never written are review in my life. I got Rushfit by mistake I ordered Tapout..but I like different so I tried it...Not good..10 minute warmup up that's shoddley put together, Sound quality is very poor. I had everything turned up on my computer still couldn't hear very well. The workout is sub par , I am an avid user of P90X, Insanity, Chalean extreme, I even like Supreme 90 day with Tom Holland even though his workout are only sometimes 20 minutes you feel it.. My heart moniter barely registered doing Rushfit...to much dead time.....I would say this would be a good beginner workout series...not one to add to a already advanced collection"
3,Rushfit,"NOT A BAD WORKOUT DVD I LIKE IT GOOD FOR TONING UP BUT I LOVE INSANITY, P90X, P90X2, AND INSANITY ASYLUM 10X BETTER."
5,Characters and Issues of Depth,"I was captured by characters that inspire, questions that are timely if we are to create the future we want, and a land and culture that is timeless. A masterful work."
3,"It worked, but still could not use it",The adapter appeared to be well so the issue was not on account of the product but my limited research.There is this thing called miliampere that tells you the power output of the adapter. You must understand what is the miliampere output of the device you want to use via the wall plug and find the adapter that matches the miliampere for your device.The one I bought was 500ma but the equipment I wanted to operate was double 1000ma. So the power output was very low and as a result I cannot use if for the intended application which is a small air compressor for a car. Yes I know 'my bad' but the cost was not substantial so I will live with it. You don't have to if you make the right choice.
5,Xanadu,"I know that this is not Academy award material but if you are really into 80's music, this will definitely appeal to you!! Loved Gene Kelly and I can only imagine what a thrill it was for Olivia to be able to work with someone of his caliber...."
2,Oh my!,"1980 was not a banner year for special effects and this film did not even try. The lip sync is way off track (like watching an old karate movie offtrack) and the story is bad and poorly presented. I give two stars only for dear Olivia - love you darling - and the music of ELO.Xanadu The Broadway Musical circa 2007 is a complete turn around and I suggest waiting for that soundtrack, even if you can't get to see the show. The Broadway Show was spectacular!"
4,A Fun and Magical Film,"The critics rated this film way too harshly when it came out. No, it wasn't academy award material. But it was a fun musical fantasy that I still find very enjoyable to watch to this day. I think Gene Kelly and Olivia Newton-John were wonderful in this film. And it contains some of Olivia's finest musical material (especially ""Magic"" and ""Suspended In Time""). You just have to appreciate it for what it is. . . a lighthearted story about friendship and innocent romance. I sometimes wish hollywood would make more movies like this today."
5,Xanadu,"Less exciting than I remember, but entertaining if your in the right mood or with the right people."
3,Still semi-enjoyable,"I loved this movie as a child, so I wanted my children to enjoy the Xanadu experience. I watched it with them, but they were not as enthused as I was about it. I guess some things lose their pull after time, and I found my adult experience to be okay. If I could change it, I would rent it next time as it has sat on our shelf since the day after I purchased it."
3,xanadu,I was disappointed at the quality of the used product. I think that maybe the used products should be inspected just a little more. LOVE the soundtrack! AWESOME! Brings back so many memories. I think the movie and the music are well worth the price!
2,Corny flick,"You know, I remember going to see this movie when I was a teenager and thinking it was a little corny, but I loved ONJ (and still do) so I endured it. My sister, who also remembers seeing it only as a younger kid, wanted this for christmas, so I ordered it. This set is great because it included the movie soundtrack as a bonus. I love ELO, too, so I really prefer the music to the film. Great chick flick, and you can't really explain to yourself why you like watching it, but you can't help yourself. It doesn't hurt that Gene Kelly also starred. But I think this role was a dive for him as a Golden age actor, dancer, singer."
5,The Eighties Live,Nice package and very clean contents. The whole family enjoyed the trip down memory lane with the video and the audio cd. I recommend this for a great family popcorn evening.
1,Should just buy the Xanadu CD...,"I bought the DVD because I remembered how much I liked the movie when it first came out. I sat through an entire showing on my home theater wondering what I could have been thinking. The movie is almost unwatchable. The story between the musical numbers is slow and plodding. The acting by Michael Beck is terrible. The direction is amateurish. It's really sad because the music in Xanadu is fantastic. But, even the terrific music can't save this mess.Love ya, ONJ! ;-)"
1,So Bad it's just plain Bad,"Please! Anyone who says that this movie is so bad that it's good is out of their mind. I really like Olivia Newton John, ELO, and certainly Gene Kelly. But just mixing them together doesn't magically make something worth watching. The story was painfully tedious to endure! I recently made the mistake of renting it, due to misplaced nostalgia. Please don't make the same mistake as me.If you must see it then you should illegally download it; the makers of this move should not be entitled to make another cent off it!"
4,Magic,"Is not one of my greatest movies to watch because the story was so silly but the soundtrack for this movie is awesome. Yes! I'm not ashamed to say that I owe the movie and cd. ""Xanadu"" was great for me because I love Olivia Newton-John so much. She has such a great voice before Christina Aquilera, Whitney Housten, & Mariah Carey. Anyone living in New York? ""Xanadu"" is coming to Broardway!"
2,Great Music But.....,"... In what started out to be a promising film turned into one of the worst disasters ever put to celluloid.It's the result of too many cooks in the kitchen, or too many ingredients in the pot. To top it off, Xanadu's script is perhaps the most ... ever written.At least the music is terrific. The visuals sometimes measure up to the music but not too often. The best sequence is Don Bluth's animation in 'Don't Walk Away' which makes the rest of the picture look really bad.If you're looking to take a nap, this is the film for you!Try to forget about the bad acting, mediocre writing, ... choreography and non existent direction. Better yet, buy the CD and forget about this turkey all together!"
3,"Nostalgic Movie of Poor Quality, Except the Music","This movie is one of those guilty pleasures. It takes me back to middle school, with all the legwarmers and lip gloss. I love it.Check out The Tubes' appearance in ""Dancin'."" This was right before they became really popular. Also, I love the song ""Whenever You're Away from Me."" I'm also a big Gene Kelly fan, so seeing him is a treat. If you like ELO, they did half the soundtrack. My favorite ELO tune in this movie is ""I'm Alive.""However, the acting is bad, and the story is poor. Basically, either you liked this movie as a kid, and still do, or all you see is a lot of 70's trendy stuff set to music."
3,Great music saves this one,"Despite the pretty colors and the serene presence of Olivia Newton-John, ""Xanadu"" is a howler right up there with ""Robot Monster."" Numbingly bad acting (poor Gene Kelly tries really hard, though), horrendous dialogue that even as a 13-year-old had me squirming with embarrassment that I had paid money to see this, special effects that scream late 70's, and horrible choreography. And the storyline . . . if a muse was coming back to inspire someone, I don't think it would be to build a roller disco.So if I think it's so bad, why give it 3 stars? First, the music. Overseen by Olivia's longtime producer John Farrar and ELO frontman Jeff Lynne, the soundtrack does not have one dull moment. I still own the soundtrack! Lastly, like the aforementioned ""Robot Monster,"" ""Xanadu"" is so bad it's funny. Rent or buy this, and I guarantee you'll be groaning, giggling--and singing along."
4,"Fun movie, good picture and sound","I fall in love with Olivia all over again every time I watch this movie. She is astoundingly beautiful in her Golden Goddess costume during her entrance in the last scene of the finale.Gene Kelly never lost the magic. He could still float across a room like he was dancing on a cloud.One complaint: the image is too large and too cropped. It's most evident and most annoying in the overhead finale shots when the top and bottom of the turntable are cut off. I compared the same frame side-by-side with an HD broadcast image, and it is in this reproduction, not the original movie.But overall, a fun movie with good picture and sound quality."
5,Xanuda,Always loved this movie and the music. Have it on VHS tape and now wanted it on DVD for the better quality.
1,Train wreck,"Not even the amazing Gene Kelly and a terrific soundtrack could save this mess. The movie has no focus, no chemistry with it's 2 leads (Keira and Sonny) and no purpose. I wasted 2 hours of my life on this debacle. Don't waste yours."
1,A LANDMARK FILM !,"Basically because, at 18 years old, this was the first film I ever fell asleep watching. There Olivia was roller-skating and singing when suddenly, everything turned black.Since then I've fell asleep in countless movies but then, you never forget your first one."
2,XANA-DON'T,"Sure, Olivia Newton-John looks great and sings even better. And Gene Kelly radiates his always-warm personna in one of his last films. ELOs music is fun, and ONJ adds a few #1 hits. But c'mon folks....this is pure dreck. There is no story that can actually be followed or dialect that even remotely resembles what real humans say to one another. The sets are [non-elaborate], the costumes post-Disco rags, and the dancing....well, there's dancing I suppose. Xanadu fails to deliver on ONJ's promise as a musical actress, and does not hold up well over time. Buy the album....skip the flick!"
4,don't knock it-- just try it!!,"What I love about this movie is that, like any good cult classic, the fans go crazy over it despite the harsh beating it takes from the ""serious"" reviewers. Sure the plot is thin, the acting is terrible and some members of the cast are actually wearing leg warmers and gold lame, but those are the things that make this movie so fantastic. Stop being so stuffy and take a trip into this cheeseball disco fantasy. If you aren't tapping your feet to the groovy ELO tunes by the time it's all over then you must be the grouchy-est codger on earth. Enjoy!!"
3,Fantastic campy fun on a flawed DVD,This was one of my favorite movies as a kid. It's hard to go wrong with ELO paired with Olivia Newton-John. If you're interested in this film you already know about the fantastic roller disco and musical sequences paired with absolutely teeth grindingly bad dialogue. But also be aware that the audio track was horribly transferred to DVD. There are significant channel and sync issues that make some of the songs almost unbearable to hear -- I'm thinking in particular of the Tubes/big band sequence with the horrifically delayed kick drum and the muffled vocal tracks. Whoever handled audio for this DVD release over at Universal needs a spanking...
3,about the 'complete' soundtrack cd...,"well, it's complete in that it contains all 10 edited down songs from the original 1980 lp. no score of any kind, no drum dreams, no fool-country (actually that one you can get on the 2cd olivia gold), no 40s standard that olivia sang as gene kelly's original muse when he was envisioning xanadu as bringing back the giant dance halls of the wwii era, and no cute little synthesized waitress dance with heels clicking. hang onto your 45s guys, because that's probably the only place we'll ever see these tracks. such a wasted opportunity. 3 stars because i still love the movie."
5,LOVE IT...I never tire of Xanadu,"""Xanadu"" I Love this movie, not only is Michael Beck beyond hot but Olivia Newton John is a delight to watch and hear as well.The soundtrack is infectious as is the movie itself.Gene Kelly is an added bonus even at his age he can still dance as effortlessly as if it were ""Singin In The Rain"".The production numbers are so over the top that it gives the movie camp and cheese appeal and it's just plain ole fun.The chemistry between Beck and Newton John is great, is it silly? Yes, but it's a gem.I watch it at least 3 times a year and never get tired of it. Actually it becomes more endearing.I rank it in my top 5 musicals of all time."
1,False advertising,"I had already bought the original XANADU on DVD and I also had the original soundtrack, as well. When I saw that the DVD was going to include a complete Soundtrack from the movie I thought, finally, the complete soundtrack is being released. Wrong. The Complete Xanadu number is the same as the one on the original. Just the song Xanadu. There were several numbers by Olivia Newton-John in the movie right before the Xanadu number. The box itself states that the Cd is the full complete soundtrack from the movie. But we were misled again. I don't understand why these companies do this. You know later on they will release it again with the complete soundtrack and then we will have to pay for it all over again."
4,Not as good as could be,"While this is better than the original release from the early 2000's, ""Xanadu: Magical Musical Edition"" isn't as good as it could be. Xanadu fans know there are so many other special features that could be included, both on the DVD (like the ""Making Xanadu"" featurette from 1980) and the Bonus CD (like the B-sides from the singles)."
3,"Xanadu- pure magic and great songs, that's all you need!","Every critic I've heard about this nostalgic movie seems to be wanting a ""MUSICAL"" to reveal what these kinds of movie are not supposed to.They're only supposed to entertain and nobody could say that the dances, effects and the best songs ever produced weren't worth it. Besides, who was it that said Olivia Newton-John lacks charisma?He must be blind and deaf !!! I have it on VHS, LD and can't wait to lay my hands on the DVD format."
3,My Secret Guilty Pleasure . . .,"I confess, I have always loved this movie. The music is wonderful, the special effects good for its time (my mouth hung open in the theatre when the muses started rolling off the wall!). On the down side, the animation sequence was so outdated as to be embarassing and Olivia should have been given more time to practice (everything), but all in all, it's FUN! Pure fun."
4,Xanadu is pure fantasy and escapism. Good music.,"I should be embarrassed to admit it, but I have always loved this movie. While I will be the first to admit, the acting is not what you'd call first rate, or even average,I think the story is a lot of fun, Olivia is sexy as hell, and the music takes me back to the days when music was memorable. This is one of those movies that you either hate or you love. I admit it. I like music, I like movie musicals, and I like to be entertained. This is a movie for anyone. You don't have to think to watch this movie."
2,"To quote an old review: ""Xanadon't...""","Wow. I couldn't sit through this movie in one sitting. It was that bad, and this is coming from a guy who typically loves bad movies. Heck, I own ""I Eat Your Skin"" and watch it quite regularly.However, Gene Kelly can act, and the ELO soundtrack is terrific. Plus, I do like the animation sequence by Don Bluth.Not really recommended unless you're insane... Or a masochist."
1,Xanadon't,"I had a hard time sitting through this, it is so bad. I like the music, so I thought I would like the DVD. If you like the songs, buy a CD."
1,Not Worth Seeing....Even for the Music,"I don't like writing negative reveiws and being a child of the 80's I normally am a huge fan of cheezy, leg warmer, roller boogie 70's and 80's musical films, however this one unfortunately did not live up to my expectations. It went beyond corny and simply became just a film made with bad taste. Since the movie and the plot were so bad, I was at least hoping that since this was a musical, the musicical performances would have been impressive (considering the very talented Olivia Newton-John and Gene Kelly were teamed up together). However even the musical performances couldn't revive this movie. The songs sounded like they came straight out of a Hollywood studio's recycling bin. Folks if you are interested in seeing this film, I would strongly recommend renting it first."
3,I like the song!,mY SISter Stacy brouhgt this movie home because her boyfriend make her watch it becuase he think this kind of stuff is cool. You should have saw the look on my uncle face about ten minutes into it. He pointed his finger at my sister and said THURN THIS OFF NOW! So I cant really give a real reveiw of this as we only saw the firt ten minutes. i did like the song at the beggining!Matthew
4,great old movie,I got this movie as a gift for my cousin. She loved it with the great old music and dancing
4,IGNORE WHAT YOU'VE HEARD - THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE !!!,"Xanadu is definately NOT IN ANY WAY,SHAPE OR FORM one of the 50 worst movies ever made! It may very well even be destined to become a timeless 80's musical. I almost passed this film up based on the hearsay,but decided to find out for myself how ""bad"" this film really was. This is a good movie! The past,present and future are all represented in a truly artistic manner which any true art/music lover can appreciate while watching this film. You can't help but identify with all three main characters. IF YOU WANT TO SEE A TOTALLY 80'S MUSIC FILM - WATCH THIS MOVIE!!! Xanadu isn't perfect by any means,but DEFINATELY NOT ranking among the worst films ever made! The person who designated it as one of the 50 worst movies ever made is more than likely one of the 50 most ignorant people ever born..."
5,fantastic movie more than 5 star`s,"Michael beck and olivia newton john where great the music of elo gave me the chill`s never heard and saw anything like that since grease. olivia has a great voice has well.And for michael beck he`s a good actor,he was good in the warriors too! good job..."
5,A Classic from the 80s!,"This is a classic 80's film. A must see, Olivia Newton-John steals the show with her voice and her rollerskating. Can't miss the surprising appearance of Gene Kelly (what was he thinking?) as a sweet ""semi-retired"" entertainer that helps make Kira's (Olivia) and (what was his name?) her male counter-part's dream of a dance club really happen, Xanadu. The soundtrack is awesome too! END"
3,Contrived,"Sonny is an album painter that just can't get inspired. Enter Kira (Olivia Newton-John) muse one each. She inspires Sonny just as 40 years earler she inspired Danny McGuire (Gene Kelly). So sunny and Danny go off to build Xanadu. There Olivia gets to sing what she does best with the slow light voiced songs as Magic and Xanadu. They get mixed in with qasi 80 stomp and a dash of big band hoopla.This was a vehicle for Olivia in her hay day allowing her to try a sound sampler from different genres. They were lucky to get Gene Kelly as he was the only thing to make the film tolerable. To bad they could not find someone real to play Sonny instead of Michael Beck who played a Highway thug in ""The Hard Ride"" (1971). The film has lost a great deal of its pizzazz over the years and the muse has failed to amuse future generations.You may want to see the original instead ""Down to Earth"" (1947) with Rita Hayworth and Larry Parks.Down to Earth Starring: Rita Hayworth, Larry Parks"
4,Xanadu,The movie got here just in time for my daughter's birthday party. It's one of those movies that's hard to find because it's an 80's movie and she wanted it so she got it. Thanks
3,Buy them separately!,"This item sat on my wish list for almost four years. Since I am going to see the theatrical production of Xanadu in June, I decided to treat myself to the DVD and CD. I had waited too long. I could buy a used copy for more than the new one would have cost or buy an unopened set for much, much more. However, for $14.72, I was able to buy the DVD and CD separately and both were eligible for Prime shipping. I guess I can put my VHS edition back in the Goodwill bag!"
4,Ooohhh man.....,".....just how can it be that something this ""bad"" be this good?! Xanadu was one of the greatest guilty pleasures in cinematic history. So hokey, corny, and silly, you'll watch the movie bewildered and with a big goofy grin on your face. Probably the ultimate tribute and swan song to '70s pop culture - a confused, overwrought, overdone mishmash of neon, disco, rollerskating, classic Hollywood musical (with a cameo by Gene Kelly), ancient Greek mythology, and even a touch of Disney style animation by Don Bluth (An American Tail) - in other words, a total mess! But yet, somehow it never fails to entertain! Now that's REALLY amazing! Featuring probably THE absolute best music ever by Olivia Newton John, it was a movie that perhaps best defined that confused cultural era we call the '70s - ridiculous, but a lotta fun!"
3,My Name,"I love this movie only because it is where I got my name from and my parents were watching it when they chose my name. Of course my name is Kira. It is like the wierdest movie I have ever seen and nothing else can compare. Until you see it you have no idea how weird it is. There are movies that span generations. You can watch them in any time period and they make sense and seem that if a re-make was done the story would be completely contemporary. That is NOT the case with this one. But you should watch it anyway for a laugh or if you name happens to be Kira and is spelled like this. My parents were watching this movie on their second date and they both turned to one another and said at the same time ""we are going to have a daughter and her name is going to be Kira"". It is special to me. But it is the wierdest movie I have ever seen. Watch it. No one else has ever seen it or heard of it. You will be one of a handful of people out there that have seen it."
4,Xanadu,"Xanadu is disco colliding with the Ronald Reagan, Urban Cowboy era. Critics loathed it. It will not go away. It opened on Broadway in 2007. New York stage shows normally become movies. Xanadu reversed the process. ELO saved their best music for Xanadu: I'm Alive and Magic. The Muses in the mural coming alive is delightful! Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem echoes: ""In Xanadu, did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure dome decree: Where Alph, the sacred river, ran through caverns measureless to man down to a sunless sea."" A few tweaks could have made Xanadu more palatable. John Travolta opposite Olivia Newton-John would have broadened its appeal. The garishness of certain scenes could have been toned down. Its redeeming element will always be its soundtrack."
4,"""Guilty Pleasure""","Another reviewer on this page referred to Xanadu as a guilty pleasure, and it's my opinion that it sums this film up briliantly.There are few scenes that are well-acted. The direction is questionable at best and the script is flat, flat, flat. But Gene Kelly is in it, and he's great. The music is fantastic. And of course, Olivia Newton-John is charming. And it's enough to get the film by.I watched this film over and over as a child, both for the music and my enormous crush on Olivia. Even now, I can watch Xanadu and thoroughly enjoy every cheesy moment.Think of this film as the last of the real musicals, made silly only because it was crafted in a time in which the sentiment expressed is no longer in vogue. If you watch it as though it were filmed in the 50's or 60's, it fares as well as Oklahoma, Seven Brides For Seven Brothers, or any number of famous musicals.If you like a musical, pick this one up, you're sure to enjoy it."
3,"Get the DVD, but be warned!","If your reading this you must like the film and are thinking about buying the DVD. Picture and sound quality are top notch, BUT, I never bought many VHS tapes because of their commericals at the start, can't stand them, well the DVD has a one minute and twenty second Universal promo that you can't skip over or avoid in any way. A really bad idea! Please let them know how you feel about this, otherwise we will be sitting through as many things as we have to wait through at the theater. Popcorn and candy ads, you know the routine."
2,WHY YOU SHOULDN'T BUY,"i love this movie. i got it on vhs, when that came out, and on dvd, when that came out. the movie, itself, is fantastic! it is well done, the color is beautiful and the score is great! i would certainly recommend the movie, itself! (and the cd.) but....the original dvd is better because it includes things about the cast.in this one, it SAYS interviews with the cast, but that means a couple of the dancers and gene kelly's wife. no one even mentions michael beck, why he was cast and why the fantasy number was needed (to avoid controversy?).if you just want the movie and cd in one package, then fine...but it would be better to buy each one, than this combo."
5,Magical,"Loved this movie then and still love it now! Fun to see how people looked and dressed back years ago! The music is awesome! I still have the big record, and now I can thoroughly enjoy watching Olivia and Gene sing their hearts out on this DVD! I enjoy their other musicals too! I was very impressed with this item!"
3,I liked it..,"Xanadu was a descent movie..Grease was still stuck in my mind with Olivia wearing those black tights at the end and John Travolta eyes popping out...ok..ok i got off track but anyway, this movie was cool and the soundtrack was lovely.."
3,YOU WILL LOVE THIS OR HATE IT,"I SAW THIS AS A KID AND WAS EXPECTING ANOTHER ""GREASE"" WHAT I GOT WAS A BIG HOLLYWOOD MUSIC VIDEO (BEFORE WE EVEN HEARD OF THEM)THIS IS FILMED LIKE A DREAM! IT DOESN'T MAKE SENCE! THAT'S FINE! JUST SIT BACK AND ENJOY THE PARTS OF THE MOVIE THAT DO WORK! I STILL LOVE THE SONG ""MAGIC"""
2,Disappointing because Olivia is so much better than this awful script,"""Xanadu"" can't seem to decide if it wants to be a roller-disco movie, a dance flick, a musical, or just a vehicle for Olivia Newton-John, who is a much better actress than this lousy script allowed. And WHAT??? is Gene Kelly doing in this movie? Was he broke?The music is good, and the storyline could have been - a Muse, one of the daughters of Zeus, comes back to inspire great looking young man with a dream - but bad dialogue and some just plain dumb production numbers (roller skaters dancing and chanting ""Xanadu"" over and over - what is that about?) spoil it. Olivia has proven herself a capable actress, and of course her vocals are superb, and all that adds up to Completely Wasted On This Movie. Ick. Two stars, and those only for the great soundtrack."
4,"So bad, it's good...","""Xanadu"" has been and will always be panned by critics, and justifiably so on some levels; awfully written dialogue, corny special effects, and a storyline weak at best...but then there's the level in which it's resurfacing. ""Xanadu"" has obtained a cult following! I can think of few movies that can take me back to warm summers, feathered- hair beauties, and great music of the then- dying decade of the seventies (if I recall, it was released in 1980). This movie somehow embraces new age kitch in a way that can only be described in a situation on NBC's ""Friends""...Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) when seeing Olivia onscreen in Joey's apartment: ""Oooh, Xanadu!"" Forget the guilty pleasure label and the critics, laugh with the movie, enjoy Olivia as the work of art she is, and just remember when cheese was pretty hot."
4,Lighthearted and Fun,"I really enjoyed this film and the music is lovely. Of course it is ""all 80's"" with the roller skates et al. Those who criticized Gene Kelly's dancing, must remember that he was 68 years old when this film was made. Personally, I think he performed some pretty nifty dance steps, which most of us who are 30 years younger couldn't do! :-) Although not his best role, his acting was just fine. I found this film to be entertaining with an interesting story line (if not somewhat complicated due to the supernatural theme). Certainly it is Olivia Newton-John at her best."
5,Im a lover of this movie!!!!,I could care less what the darn critics say about this movie!! I think it was great! I think with success of saturday night fever & then grease. They just expected too much out of hollywood?! BUt even so this was done well. I cant help but wonder two things? would it have done better as a tv release. & if its so bad why has it been rerealesed so many times?
3,Xanarific!,"I recently bought the DVD of this movie, and I LOVE IT! This was my all time favorite movie as a kid. I am now 28 and it still is number one to me. I have the compact disc and the VHS. This movie is a keeper. The music is awesome. My favorite song in the movie is ""Don't walk away"". It is an animated love scene between Kira(olivia newton John) and Sonny(Michael Beck)It is not only cute, but the song is great! I rememeber wanting to be Olivia Newton John in this movie. I used to dance around my living room to the end song ""Xanadu"". This is one movie that is a must have. If you don't own it.... I suggest you get it before it's gone."
3,Xanadu,"The music is upbeat and fun, but the plot and overall movie are a bit corny. But, overall we enjoyed it. We bought the movie after seeing the play in an attempt to understand the plot of the play better. This definitely helped."
5,Gene Kelly on roller skates?,"Yikes, Gene Kelly on roller skates in a 1980 movie is scary! So wasn't the movie ""Xanadu"". The word for this flick in 1980 was, ""dud"", or, the movie that ended the cinematic career of Olivia Newton John. Strange though how time has mulled ""Xanadu"" just as time ages a fine wine. Pop this DVD into a player and your heading into that time tunnel 30 plus years ago. All the zaney shots, hokey scenes, and 1980 electronic cinematic effects are a treat. Escapism if you will. Like playing an old pinball machine. Along comes 2008. A re-issue of the movie, with a new featurette and interviews, on DVD, and also a CD soundtrack all packed in a neat little dual pack. Now, in 2012, it seems even this little gem is getting scarce. So I bought it at a great price through Amazon. Pick up one of these sets and you will not be sorry. The train for 1980 is leaving shortly."
4,Xanadu Magical Musical edition,"Great sound and nusic. Excelent package. Wish they would have included a new soundtrack (everybody who is interested in buying this edition already have the original soundtrack)with bonus tracks, like Fool country and You made me love you that doesn't appear in the original soundtrack."
5,XANADU: A Lovely Musical Masterpiece!,"My Boyfriend told me about this movie nonstop. Because he keeps saying, ""It didn't deserved to FLOP!"" After he showed me the movie XANADU, I started saying it too. In my opinion, I think it's a lovely musical movie well done. Olivia Newton-John made a beautiful muse. Why would movie critics bash a good movie like this down like that? Because they don't have good taste in movies anyway. That's the real answer. This movie had everything in mind I needed to see. And that's:1.A Beautiful Muse.2.A nicely-written story plot3.Lovely songs to sing (soundtrack wise)4.A wonderful couple (Olivia and Michael) and5.Alot of dancing and many dreams coming true."
5,a classic...honest!,"I have watched this movie more times that any movie in history...I have been talking about it and its accompanying soundtrack for two decades now and yet people still can't seem to get it. Xanadu is fun, entertaining, flashy, beautiful and escapist. Olivia Newton John looks ravishing in this movie and the storyline- albeit a little weak- is fun and entertaining- and is that not what movies are all about? The music is of course the best thing and the dancing and 70's fashions and amazing to watch. Olivia was at her peak musically here and the songs, choreography and acting all complement each other. Buy Xanadu and enjoy two decades of fun ..like I have."
4,Great collection of recipes that grandma probably cooked,"I no longer live in the Midwest, but my sister gave me this book so that I would never forget my roots in the heartland.I think I love the ""Come for Coffee"" and ""Pride of the Heartland"" sections best. The lebkuchen recipe tastes exactly like my mother's. And I love the gingered fruit crisp recipe, with all of its variations.As for the savory dishes, they are also tasty. The country sauerkraut would make a kraut lover out of anyone. I've made several of the soups, which were all very satisfying. My Thanksgiving guests always love the wild rice, cranberry, walnut and vegetable salad.This book also has many asides which comment on the culture which created Midwestern cooking: thrifty farmers' wives, potlucks at the church, and agricultural fairs. In all it speaks to the values of the heartland: frugality, community, generosity, and excellence."
4,Groundbreaking,"Every comment I've ever read about this book refers to it as ""groundbreaking."" A cliche, yes, but also true. This sprawling, yet tightly edited, collection breaks new ground not only in its juxtaposition of Asian and queer issues, but also in its unique and progressive vision: a refusal to break queer Asians into merely a collection of P.C. buzzwords, and an assertion of the unique and whole individuals who constitute queer Asian America."
5,We liked it so much we bought another one.,I bought one for my wife and she liked it so much we bought one for our 15 year old daughter. It's not often that a 15 year old and a Mom agree on how good an item is.
5,VERY pleased,"The pictures, the specs, the reviews don't do it justice. This is a beautiful jewelry box and my wife LOVES it. It is also bigger than I'd realized and I feel it is an amazing bargain for the price. If you are looking for a jewelry box, buy this one!"
4,Jewelry Box,"The box is beautiful, costing less than half of others of the same quality. However, the bottom drawer does not close properly"
5,Best gift ever!,"I sent this to my mother in law for her birthday. Arrived within days, in perfect condition. I have not seen it, but she says it is the most beautiful jewerly box she has ever seen, and stores an amazing amount of things. The wood is beautiful with fine workmanship and looks beautiful on her dresser. She stills talks about it months later. She was just thrilled, her favorite gift ever!"
3,So well researched that he lost me,"I'm sure for an historian of WWII, this is an amazing resource, but I am not. There were so many characters and it kind of flipped back and forth, so that I never knew where he was talking about. He lost me about 1/3 of the way into the book. I feel guilty not finishing, but I think I'll see the movie instead. As I said - I feel certain someone else with a little more interest or knowledge would find this a wonderful book and give it 5 stars!"
5,The Longest Day,"Excellent reading! It brings home the awesome responsibility of the Commander of Allied Forces. For those who have seen Normandy it also brings home the heart wrenching realization of the cost in human life. And, guess what, it was supposed to be the 'war to end all wars.'"
5,The Longest Day,It was excellent reading. This is a classic. You can live the story and almost feel the bullets flying around.
4,The Longest Day,"Good Read....I do find I sometime compare it the movie. Very well written, I will try some of his other offerings."
5,The best book on D-Day,Read this book first when I was 15 years old and it motivated me to learn more about history of the second world war. It's one of the great books on world war II and D-Day and it is highly recommended!
5,"Real persons, real Heroes","Only those who were involved in armed conflict can understand and explain the horror, fear and hatred that builds in normal human beings who fight in a war. In this masterpiece, Mr. Ryan introduce us to the real men that fought on the beaches of Normandy (and also on the sea and inland like the airborne divisions)not only from the allies point of view, but also the germans who were also very brave soldiers and (this is very easy to forget) human beings (lots of them didn't even like the nazi party, they were fighting for their country and families).This book is the work of a man that isn't satisfied with anything short of perfection. He wanted the truth, and in my humble opinion...I think he got it.If you want some audio visual reference, don't miss ""saving Private Ryan"" and the classical ""The longest day""."
4,What?!!! I didn't know *THAT*!!!!,"For everything I *thought* I knew about the D-Day invasion, this book (even in the first 75 pages) had me saying HOLY COW!!! I had no idea!As a history dabbler, I did not want heavy, burdensome details (extensive listing of equipment with full nomenclature, many confusing names and places and minutiae), but I also did not want pure fluff. This book delivered with an extremely easy to read combination of facts and day-in-the-life details that brought the action to life. Jumping between the Allied and German perspective kept the momentum going and delivered suspense - even though I already knew the results.THAT qualifies as a good book! Definitely a must read!"
5,HEARTBREAKING,"This book should be on the required reading list of everyone who is lucky enough to call America home. The raw courage of the men (American, Brits, Canadians, and French) who fought on the beaches of Normandy on D-Day is inspiring and heroic...as I was crying my eyes out at some of Ryan's passages, I didn't even feel that I had the right to shed tears for these men, since compared to what they went through, my time on earth has shown me little pain...If you know a WWII veteran, PLEASE PLEASE thank him."
5,A true classic,"There can never be enough films or books about WWII. In terms of realism, suspense, and relentless action, The Longest Day ranks right up there with the best of the genre, I put it on an equal level with classics like the Brotherhood of War novels and The Triumph and the Glory."
5,One of the classics,This book began my long interest in military history. Mr Ryan brought the events of the day together in a way that was intense and intimate. I strongly recomend this book to be read by any young reader who wants to understand the heroism of a past age.
2,well researched,"The book was well researched but kind of fragmented. I thought the movie was better, but a lot of hollywood in it."
4,Spellbinding.,"I was sorry when I had to put the book down at the end.Two things bothered me:1. Page 125 mentions PFC Colin Powell in a way that indicates he survived the war, but he is not on the list of ""where they are now"", although he's in the index. Who was he? The Colin Powell who was a general and US Secretary of State was born in 1937 and would have been seven years old n D-Day. And he was never an enlisted man.2. The German office who put his boots on wrong: In the film, he dies with his wrongly-booted feet in the air. In the book he survives the war. Which was it."
5,Excellent .... left me wanting to read more ...,"I preface this review with the fact that I am NOT a historian ... and I'm not even that knowledgeable about WWII history. However, I do like to read non-fiction, especially history, and I thoroughly enjoyed this book.The book is truly a page-turner and puts perspective on what my grandfather's generation went through not only during the Normandy invasion but also during WWII overall (not that the book discusses much outside D-Day, but does give perspective).The only problem I had with the book is that because it was so immersive, I actually had a hard time sleeping after reading any of the pages. The images painted by it were going through my head ... (and I have not had similar issues with other books that I can remember).The book was so good that I'm now seeking out other WWII books (currently reading 'Flags of our Fathers') to help satiate my hunger for a better understanding of WWII."
2,"Poor quality sound, Poor power supply.","I purchased these based on the previous reviews on this page.My advice? Look elsewhere, I picked up two sets of these (one for my each of my computers). It only took about one week for the power supply to fail on set one. I noticed that the 10V power supply (included), fits quite loose where it interfaces with the unit. (This holds true for both sets). I was unable to get the first set to power up, even when using the power supply from my 2nd set. The sound is barely acceptable. The treble end is severely lacking. Even after playing with the EQ on my mp3 player, I could not strike a good balance of treble with the over powering bass.I would not recommend this product. BOO!Update: Only two months later, the power supply on both sets of speakers has failed. These speakers are a waste of your money, steer clear."
5,Awsome speaker set for the price!,These speakers sound awsome for the price! I was expecting so so but received great instead! Easy to set up and use and the price can't be beat.
5,Great speakers for the price,"Creative SBS 380 2.1 SpeakersI needed some speakers with a headphone jack and subwoofer for a newly re-built PC. The new motherboard didn't support the old Boston Acoustics digital speakers I was using with the original motherboard.These analog speakers do the job without breaking the bank. Not the highest fidelity in the world, but for my purposes they are perfect."
4,Real sound,"These speakers were really just a whim, plus I needed to add a few bucks for free shipping with another item from Amazon - in Hawaii we love Amazon's free shipping! They had to fit in my desk cubbyholes. The originals I was using were really tinny, but as I only use sound for internet stuff and occasional CD music I don't care much. If I want to seriously listen to music or see a film I have a decent home theater system. There is some justification to the complains of too much bass (and no balance controls) which I solved by stuffing the tube in the subwoofer with part of a duster pad (cut to size). For the price and size I'm happy as a pig in slop with these."
1,too much bass!,"It may be hard to believe that you can have too much bass. You can. Simply put, I purchased this set for my computer and I must say it does not work properly. I had to adjust the equalizer in my system just to get a listenable mix. I suppose it might be O.K. at very low volumes, but it distorted severely at my usual listening levels. I can say, on the positive, that I plugged these in to my cheap portable CD player and they sound awesome. So for that purpose I can recommend these speakers."
1,"read the bad reviews--too much bass, tinny satellites, no power","I bought these speakers thinking that the bad reviews were probably just that--bad reviews. Unfortunately they turned out to be spot on. There is way too much muddy sounding bass produced by the subwoofer, and there is no way to reduce it except by using an equalizer such as through Itunes. And the satellite speakers, besides sounding tinny, produced very little sound. With everything turned to max that could be maxed, the volume was moderate--forget about cranking it up a bit for a song that you like. In this case you really do get what you pay for."
5,Duane,"Great speakers for the money. These speakers are way better than the entry level ones (with no sub) you have to pay $20.00 for when you buy a Dell. The sub gives a nice deep bass. Great volume for a P.C.. Volume & power control on speakers with headphone jack is a great feature and one of the main reasons I choose these. Nice looking also. Small compact speakers fit nicely anywhere and the sub is not to bulky and looks and sounds great sitting on, not under, my desk."
3,SBS 380 2.1 speakers,"delivered 4/12/2007, have a fairly good sound BUT. There appears to be a short or mis-connection to the right speaker unit. the wire does not plug in solidly and has no sound coming from the right speaker. There appears to be a positional problem with the power. You have to ""move or wiggle"" the cord for it to make electrical connection. The speakers were inexpensive but not worth the problems. I think there is a design or production flaw. Save your time don't order. You'll only have to replace."
5,The Bass is unreal!,"When I purchased this system I had very low expectations about its performance based on the price.However, I was pleasantly surprised by the silky bass this system pushes out.The higher frequencies are somewhat muted, but overall a solid system.The volume could be a tad more though, but adequate."
4,"So you're wondering ""who the hell is the Big F?""","The Big F is essentially Berlin, without the chick singing. But the music is much, much harder. Though nowhere near as slamming as their self-titled debut ""Is"" does contain some great songs with ""Patience Peregrine"" the stand-out track. A hard-driving rhythm section pounds behind anguished vocals and non-linear guitar playing to create a sound so original no one wanted to hear it. With their albums long out of print, used bins at record stores are about the only place to track their masterpieces down."
4,I Need A Vacation...,"This album is straight up feel-good music, no matter how you cut it. The album kicks off with Opening Act, which explains Ugly Duckling's position in the concert world. Haha, if you heard the track, you know what I'm talking about. It moves on to Turn It Up, which is one of the best on the album. This is one of the few CDs that gets better later on, with tracks such as Potty Mouth and Pass It On. Young Einstein really shines on this one, even more than Journey To Anywhere. The album is not perfect, though. I just can't seem to get into Mr. Tough Guy, and I'm back and forth on Energy Drink. Also, the whole Meat Shake theme can get a little stale after multiple listens. For the love of god, though, don't let this turn you off from picking this one up. You'll be quite pleased, if I may so myself. Goodnight now..."
5,Bringing back the sound,"This album is perfect pure genius. This is what hip-hop used to be about. When rap and hip-hop was about the rap not the rapper. Even before De La Soul, back to Grandmaster Flash days. ""Have you ever been over a friend's house to eat and the food just ain't no good?"" This album is easily the most innovative, creative, successful album I've heard in years. Listen to it. Listen to the flow and the beats. Listen to the rhymes. Don't talk about how ""goofy"" or ""funny"" UD is. Pay attention to how smart and skilled UD is. One complaint. Where's the props for the album that made this album possible; De La Soul is Dead? Biddies in the BK Lounge?"
4,Smart rap for the No Logo crowd,"Great beats, solid anti-consumerist message, and, for a wonder, funny skits. The smarts come through all the way from the songs to the packaging. I picked this up on spec because I liked the cover. Definitely counts as a find."
5,a definite must buy,"so sick they should rename the flu to ugly duckling...tight tracks, beautiful flows and rock solid production...authentic hip hop at its best."
1,What happened?,"I loved Ugly Duckling's first two albums, and their live show was outstanding. Seeing as I downloaded the first two albums when Napster was alive and well (ahh the good old days!) I immediately purchased this album with no delay. Boy was I dissappointed. Aside from the cheesy skits, the production fell short of the first two albums (especially Journey to Anywhere). Don't get me wrong, I'm not looking for profound, life-altering lyrics in all the music I listen to, but some substance to work with is nice. I always thought UD was funny, lyrics were creative, and Andy especially can flow better than 95% of the MCs out there, but this album is really sorry. All that being said, I will continue to support UD on their next release. Using my logic, I downloaded 2 albums for free, so I still have to buy one more to even things out. If you're new to UD, I would recommend Journey to Anywhere first and Fresh Mode second. Save your money on this one though, it's pretty bad..."
2,Overrated,"Plain and simple, this album is overrated. First of all, the whole meat shake thing is stupid. The skits are not funny, if I was back in 7th grade, I might find the humor in it. They center the entire album around such a lame concept. Second, the emcees are average at best. The beats are alright, but nothing we haven't heard before. The only song on the album I really liked was La Revolucion. For some reason, a lot of the emo-hoppers have praised this album. Just another reason to dislike it. Save your money and pick up some real hip-hop."
2,I want my time back,"Interesting concept but incomplete. Not only that, the movie sucks you in, but the writer had no ending for the movie, leaving you wondering why did you waste your time watching it in the first place. Skip it and spend your time on something better written."
4,Western Culture After Virtue,If you want to understand how our society got to be like the one depicted in this film. Read MacIntyre's After Virtue about the untethering of humanity from purpose (telos) in the Enlightenment. This is the world that Nietzsche lived in and it drove him mad.
1,Trite theatrical farce,"The fact that this work has been critically acclaimed these days testifies to how low people's tastes have dropped. Yet another farcical melodrama featuring such novel emotive device such as bodily amputations, nostalgia for the idyllic life and caricature of materialism. Yes, people these days watched Hollywood too much that they forgot about these themes which have been repeated million times by junk literature writers, but that does not make this movie less banal. The screen writer seems to hold the belief that his audience is so stupid and insensitive these days that he can just stuff all these well-rehearsed themes into one big splash and get away with it. It is unfortunate that people do seem to respond that way."
4,MUCH MUCH BETTER THEN MOJO / TDK,"Excellent audio, very comfortable, user-friendly. Far superior the TDK's MOJO. Very easy to transfer MP3 files.Cons: no external memory could be added."
5,Highly recommended,"Exposes the Founding Fathers for what they really were. Gives us a new perspective from which to view our system of government and the people who run it. Not for die-hard patriots. For: those who always felt their high school history books were leaving something out! Makes you appreciate other cultures' ways, especially the Native Americans...specifically the Iroquois. Easy read."
3,SMALL,There's nothing materially wrong with these boxers but they run really small. I bought these as a gift knowing he wore a M but they run atleast one size smaller. I'm a girl that wears a size 0-2. I can wear these as pajama shorts comfortably..
4,Great Buy,"Product is great, but definitely order one size larger! My boyfriend is a size 32-34 and that is a size Medium, but they are snug on him.. So I am exchanging for a Large."
1,"Boxers are for old men, get a thong instead","My opinion as a woman: I don't understand why men keep thinking that Boxers are in and cool. Men in boxers look unatractive (my grandfather used them, they are obsolete). My female friends call boxers, grandpha briefs.Also this boxer does not provide support for men where they need it. and it is a known medical fact that lack of support can cause organs to sack.Get a thong instead. Women love how men in thongs look. They look very sexy and masculine. I recommend a thong from HOM or Undergear instead."
3,who dry cleans boxers?,"These are nice and silky silk boxers - almost exactly what i expected, except after i put them through the gentle cycle and hung them to dry I noticed they shrunk. Then I read the care label...dry clean only.(I live in a valley that doesn't even have a public laundromat) and this was not mentioned in the info when purchased. Very sad."
1,Don't buy,"There is a seam in the back that is not well sewn and is like having a shoe-string in your crack. However, Intimo silk boxers, the stretch ones with a small percentage of spandex, don't even have a seam on the behind and are made much better."
2,Not soft,"I had a really nice pair of silk boxers that got lost and wanted to buy a new pair. While the old ones were really soft, these actually feel rough, like imitiation silk..."
3,they run small,They are nice well made shorts. The only problem I had was they are too small for me so I gave them to my wife. I ordered large and they fit like medium. Make sure you order a size larger then you wear and they will fit you just fine.
4,Comfortable,"This review is about the Intimo boxers only and not about the debate of boxers over other types of undergarment. I purchased a couple of pairs for my husband. He finds them comfortable. I put them in a lingerie bag and wash them in the washing machine in cold water. After several months, they are still in good condition."
3,"Sized small, order 1 size larger.","These are reasonably priced for silk boxers, and seem reasonably well made (I just got them and have not put them through a wash yet). However, if you are used to regular cotton boxers (like Fruit of the Loom or Hanes), please note that the Intimo silk boxers seem to run about a size smaller. So their medium is like a Hanes small, etc. I suggest getting one size larger than you normally wear. These are nice and cool, especially good for the summer."
2,Poor quality,These did not hold up well after a few washings. My husband has had these for about 6 weeks and the seams are already wearing out. They have been washed on gentle and line dried every time.
4,A solid product,"I just purchased two pair of Intimo Classic Silk Boxers and was very pleased with the product. I'm 5'5"" and have such a hard time buying clothes that fit. Most Men's clothes I purchase are too big and have to be altered or I have to shop in the Boy's department. I expected the same out of these boxers but was pleasantly surprised that they fit like a glove. I bought a Small and it fit like a Men's X-Small (or what an actual small should feel like). Be aware of that when you buy them. The sizes run delightfully smaller than our usual American oversized scale.The fabric feels very comfortable, lightweight and aerie. The silk quality may not be the finest on the market, but they are a wonderful purchase for the price. Perfect for a romantic evening or as relaxing lounge-wear.If you are looking for a good pair of silk boxers, I recommend these to anyone."
3,Its importance is its influence on the sons,"Henry James Sr. was involved in the most impractical kind of abstract speculation. His philosophical reflections which seemed to remove himself so far from everyday reality were reacted to by his two great sons, the philospher William and the novelist Henry. William especially in developing America's only original philosophy pragmatism seemed to contradict directly the kind of pie-in-the sky speculation the elder James( who in his time was one the wealthiest of Americans ) indulged in here."
1,Beware!! These are not the original recordings!,"I was very disappointed. Although the cd has the original artists, they are not the original recordings. It wasn't until I received the item that I realized all but two songs were ""new stereo recordings"", which really wasn't what I was looking for."
5,"My 18, 4/5yr old pupils voted this story No.1. B. Lawless","Getting and keeping the attention of eighteen 4 and 5 year old children is no mean task, The Bear under the Stairs, had them riveted, All of them. And at the end of the story the best accolade ever, expressed in three wounderful words,"" Again teacher again.""Barbara A Lawless.(Nursery Teacher, The Infant School. Bahrain .)"
3,Not as good as Volume 1.,This didn't go as in depth as I was would have liked. They fast forwarded their relationship too much. Volume 1 was much better.
2,Luke and Laura....,"While this is the continuation of the Luke and Laura story, I was not as pleased with this tape as the first one. I bought this tape just to relive faint memories of the Luke and Laura saga. I should have just stopped with the first tape. Watching the second one made me remember just how corny and silly the eighties were. It made an interesting love story for television, and if you are a huge General Hospital fan, you may enjoy it much more than I did. I enjoyed the first one better; it featured the courtship and wedding."

3,Great Original material but DVD extras are a zero.,"Having owned and enjoyed the original laserdisc, I expected at least some improvements. Video and audio quality were perhaps not as good as the original LD. The added commentary by Michael Nesbeth (who was at the forefront of video entertainment) seemed like a cynical jab at good quality commentary i.e. it could only be comprehensible to someone so far in space that they couldn't turn on their DVD. Here you need a commentary to understand the commentary."
5,"Loved the film, BUT.......","I just recieved the DVD of ""Elephant Parts"" & have just finished watching it, I haven't laughed soooo much in years!!. I used to own the VHS version a long time ago & watching my new copy tonight, it reminded me how funny it was. Mike Nesmith is trully a genius when it comes to not only producing music, but video as well & it's a big pitty that he didn't go further with his ""back-to-back"" video concept (MTV format) that he sold to a large television company, it could have been so much more interesting!!. I do have ONE slightly small complaint, I found the video quality it's self, to be poor. I remember seeing the video version I had having a much clearer picture, has the video deteriorated over the years, or was it sourced from an inferior master tape?. Apart from that I loved watching it again for the first time in years & hope that his follow-up T.V. series ""Televison Parts"" will also be released on DVD in the near future!"
5,Great blast from the past,"When I learned this was out on DVD, I had to get it!I first saw this when I went off to college in the early 80s and loved it. Always remembered several of the skits, like ""Nachos? We don't need no stinkin' nachos!"" and ""margengrena"".Later on, when Nez did ""TV Parts"", I watched it religiously (and wished I had taped it). Sigh. I wish they'd bring that out on DVD too, like so many other TV shows are doing."
2,Too flimsy,This is a nice idea but it doesn't attach well to my stroller bars and it is just too flimsy.
4,A must,"I wish this came standard with the stroller, but it doesn't. It's a necessity when you're out for a run or just out.I didn't give it 5 stars because the cup holders are not good for big drink cups, only cans, water bottles and narrow cups. Also, there is a lot of extra space. It would be nice if there was another pouch to separate your stuff. But since this is the only one that fits the stroller, I would still highly recommend it."
5,A necessary buy for a BOB,"This is a very functional, useful and very necessary addition to a double BOB stroller. The cup holders fit most standard size cups. I do have a few large Nalgene bottles that are too big, but they don't fit in any holders. The zipper pocket in the middle is perfect to hold keys and phone, and usually something extra like a small pack of kleenex or granola bar. I just wish these things would be designed with the stroller, but that is a complaint against the stroller, not against this product."
3,Good but not great,I have the single BOB with the handlebar console and love it! It's as useful as the stroller itself. But the handlebar console for the duallie BOB does not fit well.It sits half way up the handle bar which gives it a flimsy fit. Either the console material needs to be longer so that it can fit snugly against the stroller part of the handlebar or the velcro straps need to be longer to give the user the option of placing it wherever on the handlebars it is wanted. Seems like a lazy design by BOB. Definitely disappointed but still use it like crazy.
3,works with our double jogger but a little flimsy,"it does fit the double jogger stroller we got but its a little flimsy, and i would of prefferred the drink holders to be a little wider... we had to really push our cups down in there... also would of liked more space for extas... its definately better than not having a parent tray but not as high quality as i thought it would of been for bring the fancier brand and all so disappointed..."
3,Helpful drink caddy,This is a good drink/caddy for the double jogging stroller but I wish they would have utilized more of it. There is alot of empty space that could have held two more drink cups or more storage.
3,pleased but...,I bought the console for a Schwinn double stroller because it doesn't have a drink holder. This one is definately made for the BOB and is a tight fit on the Schwinn. But we made it work fine and it held the weight of 2 water bottles or drinks just fine and did it's job. It just isn't secured quite the way it's supposed to be.
4,Handle bar console,"The pocket in the middle is very small. It seems bigger in the picture. The cup holders are slim and will only fit slim bottles, however, this is a jogging stroller so it would make sense that the holders will only fit slim/water bottles. On the console it clearly states not to put hot beverages in the holders. This product is made out of fabric so it will spill easily. The straps that secure the product to the BOB is Velcro but it seems to be pretty strong."
4,BOB Handlebar Console For Duallie Strollers - Black,This is designed for the Bob so it works well. It is not what we expected as it is is not plastic but just nylon fabric.
4,"Decent organizer, but doesn't fit City Elite","I'm leaving this review to let people know that this organizer does NOT fit the City Elite double stroller. It was not advertised to fit any other strollers besides the BOB, but I read the dimensions online and thought it would be compatible, it's not and the straps are too short so I'll be returning it.If you have a BOB, it will be a good organizer, though I was slighly disappointed that there were only 3 compartments and somehow expected it to be a bit bulkier. Overall, would be a good purchase for the right stroller."
5,Works great!,"Cup holder easily holds water bottles, coffee cups (you know, the Starbucks kind) and sippy cups! Haven't had a spill yet."
4,"Nice, but should just come with the stoller.",It's a decent product and a decent price- but for the $580 cost of the stoller the handlebar console should come with it.
