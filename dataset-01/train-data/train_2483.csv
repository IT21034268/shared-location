4,HOT STUFF SIZZLED!!!!,"Picked this up in the office exchange for a business trip to Denver. What a fine little book to end summer with!!!The trilogy I understand begins with the oldest sister, Annabelle and her prime target, Brandon Vaughn. It was a fun read from beginning to end. I liked the family 'situation' and applaud Uncle Yank for rising to the occastion of inheriting 3 nieces.The sisters stick together like glue and I suppose this is why this is the beginning of the trilogy. Brandon makes a great hero! Family baggage and all. It's a feel good book. Looking forward to reading the next two. The author keeps us dangling with Uncle Yank's angst! :D:D:Another plane ride conquered!!!!"
3,"The first try, not the best, not the worst","This is the first book I,ve read of this author and it didn,t inspire me to read the other ones of the trilogy. Maybe I was expecting more of the plot or something,but the truth is none of the plot exited me very much. I like to read books that are hard for me to put down.The characters weren,t very interesting for me.But if you like an easy read and a happy ever after ending, this is not the worst book you could read."
2,These candles are definitely scented,They have a strong vanila scent when I opened them and I haven't even burned them yet. Otherwise they are fine but I just wanted to let you know that they are not unscented.
2,Not so much,I bought these to go on my fireplace candelabra. They didn't work out well at all. I couldn't get them to push down onto the very small spike that holds them to the candelabra. When I tried two of them split in half! Ugh!! Frustrating. I ended up going to target and those worked great. I'll save the ones that are left to just burn on a flat plate or whatever.
1,Product description different from photo,Desxription and picture stated that this was a set of candles! When I received the package it was a single candle. Very disappointed.
2,Has had to be replaced three times,"I love the speakerphone...but the voice dialing never understands anyone who has tried to dial with it. The phone's battery always dies early, and it has had to be replaced three times for various things - mainly it will not close all the way and makes the battery die."
2,Poor Quality - defective after one year of usage.,"Poor quality by Motorola after a little more than one year usage. But for listening using a wired headset, the audio microphone and speaker of the cell phone are now at such a low level as to be unusable. There are better choices for quality. There are many features to this phone - the voice recognition dialing is a nice feature."
1,Terrible Phone,"This is an absolutely horrible phone! The first one I bought quit working after about 3 months. The ear-piece quit putting sound out and the only way I could talk to someone was with the speakerphone. Then, I got a new phone, and it worked pretty well for about 4 months, but now, it will randomly power off, it will hold a charge for a good 12 hours (without using it), and barely charges when I plug it in. Apart from that, sometimes it won't send text messages, and it's not the service. The screen is so small that it's hard to see things. The camera takes decent pictures, but nothing to write home about, and unless you send it to your computer you can barely tell what it is because of the small screen. My advice, buy some other phone, this one will just cause you problems."
1,"don't buy it, replaced twice in 240 days","i bought this phone in march and have replaced it twice since then (it's november). the people at verizon say it is a piece, and they are just poorly made. generally it works fine for a while, then there is a lot of static on the line. this is a common complaint, again per verizon. it's happened twice. i wonder why they didn't mention it when i bought the phone. also, it sometimes reboots when you are trying to send a text message cold, i.e. not replying to somebody. i would highly recommend getting anything else."
1,complete tard bagg phone!,I got my unit and on the second day the speaker stopped putting out sound. The only way to hear now is to put it on speaker phone. I gave it a 1 star rating becuase of the other reviews even though I havnt experienced the same numberous problems.
1,grrr,"ok heres the story of my phone...it was found in a pile of snow then my friends girl friend had it for a while...then i got it and its been nothing but trouble.ok it has some cool stuff like a cam and you can email audio to it and what not...but damn its got static issues and mine decided to say ""screw it im gonna keep my backlight on 24/7/365!""i enjoy the speakerphone option but even that is pretty crappy...its just ghetto.its a step up from the kx414 i had but still...its caused so many damn issues...if i could afford a new cell id get a LG VX8100...you can store up to a gb on it with the expansion card...so good. yeah dont get this phone its pretty much a paper weight"
3,Not that bad...,"Ok, so this phone isn't perfect but I don't know many that are. I have to say that I've had great reception using this phone in most places, even very unexpected ones such as out in the middle of the woods. It's comfortable and the screen is great - when lit!And to be honest, I don't think I've had a dropped call - ok, maybe once - but otherwise it connects most of the time and I don't randomly lose folks as I did with an older Nokia.Buttons are tad bit small, and, in contrast to what I mention above - if the the screen is not lit you CANNOT read it. Bad design for sure.Battery life is pretty terrible, which is one of my biggest complaints for sure."
1,"As a cell phone one star, as a hockey puck all five!","I purchased this phone for my elderly father and all it accomplished was make both of us much older! Charging issues seemed to be the primary demon and even after repeated trips to verizon it still was an issue.I finally realized battery charge time option was not set correctly and at least that problem went away! key pad rediculously small , screen you can't read at 20yrs old let alone 80yrs old and a phone conversation volume that would make anyone visit the local drug store for a ear wax removal kit! dropped calls , static if you did connect, clumbsy awkward feel and my fathers relentless complaints have all contributed to the final fate of our v265! I wouldn't recommend this phone to anyone except fisherman and hockey players ! If you do purchase one of these phones be sure to get the insurance It's a must if you expect to get a replacment when you throw the thing in the bay! WITH THE REST OF OURS!"
3,Your basic cheapo phone,"I got one of these for free to replace my wife's older candy-bar size phone. Basically, for free we got what we paid for. The phone stopped working after about a month and had to be replaced. It's nice and loud like most Motorola phones, but the voice quality is not particularly good - her calls to me sound muffled. But she likes it OK, mainly because the battery lasts forever, the black color is spiffy, and she can finally control the ringer volume from the side rocker switch without navigating any menus.This phone's too small for me - but if you like tiny phones it's definitely tiny. Camera and screen are of below-average quality."
4,Motorolas the best,"This is a very good phone, alot of phones offer the same features but motorola phones are just better than LG Samsung Audiovox etc. With verizon as your subscriber you cant go wrong clear reception not like T-mobiles garbage system or nextels you keep breaking up trash thats probably why they went to push to talk so you would overlook the clarity. All i have to say is i know you can hear me now."
1,Phone and Carrier are terrible,Phone's display is so small and Verizon has a policy of extending your contract anytime you change your rate plan! I know several people who haveactually been extendedand they were never told or asked if this was ok! Beware of Verizon and this phone!
2,"Movie Over Rated ! More Hostage, Less Verbiage.","The movie was delivered ahead of schedule and it was in perfect condition. The movie wasn't as great as I thought from the advertisements. The best parts of the movie were shown in the advertisements. For that reason I rated the movie low. More hostage, less verbiage."
2,Moderatly redone classics,"Though these are the songs that make the Mills Brothers famous, they are not the original recordings that made these songs famous, and not necessarily sung by the same men that sang the originals (certainly they are considerably older). These are OK, but they lack the punch and familiarity (to a fan like myself) of the originals. The title, though not actually misleading, leads one to believe you will be listening to the original songs--they are not. I recommend only if you must have the complete set of mills Brothers records."
1,Very disappointing. Sounds like Lawrence Welk.,"I love the sound of original Mills Brothers,but this was a disappointing collection of their original tunes,done in a 60's style with none of the ""class"" of earlier releases."
3,Not Quite,"I would like to learn how singers, not just the Mills Brothers, can record songs for a certain record company, collect their royalties and then some years later re-record them (after their old contract is up?) and come up with a tired lackluster ""too-good-to-be-true"" compilation that doesn't match the first versions at all in performance. But here you have it. If you have no recollection of the originals, these will do for you; if you're looking for the old orchestrations (the guitar should fall in right here) and gusto, forget it. Try another compilation."
3,Individual Downloads are a bit off,"I downloaded about half of the songs on this album individually in Amazon MP3 downloads. Only about half of the songs I downloaded were the songs listed. The titles were correct, but when I clicked on the song in my media player, it was a completely different (Mills Brothers) song, perhaps the links are a little scrambled, but I am leary about using the service further as I didn't receive what I was intending to purchase. Song quality was good even if the song was incorrect, though"
1,"Re-recordings, NOT the originals","First, these are re-recordings from much later in the career of the Mills Brothers.Second, they lack the special quality of the originals. They sound mundane, and the instrumental backing is about the quality you'd expect if the Holiday Inn out by the interstate near Akron Ohio was having a band playing in its lounge.Third, find yourself and buy their original 1930s and 1940s recordings of these tunes, to hear some of the most delightful vocals (including vocal harmonies and their incredible imitations of music instruments) you will ever hear. These are not them."
1,disapointed,"the mills bros origional recordings are warm and smooth and mellow and take you back to a time when songs had words that were kind and thoughtful. this cd has been up dated they dont sound the same. it sounds like they did voice overs and added a echo and back ground music to make the sound fresh but this has changed what made the mills bros so loved,there warm sound"
4,The Bees Knees,"This is a great album. It has all of the Mills Bros. Favorites and the recordings are clear and well produced. If you buy one Mills Brothers album, this is the one to have. I'd also recommend Command Performance as a great record."
5,For Whatever Reason,"I have written about 3 reviews out of almost 300 in response to former reviews. The earlier ones here that have garnered so many votes made me come out of hiding. If my identiy is known soon, that's fine. This is a great collection, capturing one of the great periods of Americana music. It's the Mills Brothers Greatest Hits. Straight up and excellently recorded. What on God's green earth would cause two negative reviews, with so many positive votes?BK"
1,Sure did NOT work for me!,"Did nothing for my appetite.. I wanted it to work really bad, but no luck! After a week, I decided I am sending it back."
5,Last book of the 'Doing it .... better' miniseries,I thought this book had a great story + solid character development + amazing fun love sense; which equals a great sexy romance novel. Esmeralda is a psychic and when the signs tell her a man from her past will arrive she is blown away when it's Mitch Margolin. This book has some great plot twists that some you see coming and other are don't. Overall I enjoyed the ride - great novel - always a great author! Enjoy!Check out the 'Doing it .... better' miniseries;With His Touch (Harlequin Blaze)andAt Her Beck And Call (Harlequin Blaze). Off to read her newest novelNo Stopping Now (Harlequin Blaze).
4,Earthy humor and Country/Folk Roots,"Little King of Dreams takes its time in seducing you. The disc's relaxed arrangements and the wry humor don't hit you broadside, but sneak up on you until you find yourself humming its tunes and savoring its subtleties. Where bands like The Nields, Moxy Fruvous and Eddie From Ohio are more direct with their humor and up-front with their harmonies, Reed shows the restraint of a well-seasoned pro--showing that the notes you don't play are as important as the ones you do. This is the real deal--not corporate-country tripe. A great addition to any CD library!"
5,Amazing,A MUST read for everyone. This is an essential book that is a need for all backgrounds to be enlightened by
4,BACKGROUND MUSIC FOR AUTHOR,"While I was writing THE WINDS OF OCTOBER, my novel based on my experiences in Greece during its civil war in the late '40s, I popped this CD in my computer for inspiration; it took me back to my days with the Joint US Military Mission. If you love Greece and enjoy Greek music this is a nice addition to your music collection.James R. ""Jim"" StephensAlso author of CAMERA SOLDIERS: The Philippine Odyssey"
3,Not for me,"I guess I'll go against the flow and say I didn't care for this album. A few of the songs were, for my taste, pretty good, but the majority of them reminded me of very processed music with overly arranged vocals (okay, I heard ""Ray Conniff Singers"" in my head when I listened to it...but that is a bit of an exaggeration.) After listening to this album, it didn't sound much like some of the other traditional Greek music I had purchased for my upcoming trip. Other albums of ethnic music I have (Turkey, Greece, Croatia etc. etc.) don't sound nearly so arranged and processed, they are much rawer and down to earth. Frankly, I gave it away and it is gone from my collection. Listen carefully to the samples, if they are your cup of tea, great."
5,"Great Fun, Great Tips!","As with other publications from the folks at Cook's Illustrated, I just love this book. The book is fun to look at, and many of the tips produce the type of admiration that comes with recognizing a good idea that's going to make food preparation more efficient and more fun. Reading this book is like having your grandmother, or several grandmothers, in the kitchen with you, looking over your shoulder, and saying ""here honey, let me show you a good way to do that."""
3,Don't Bother with this Book if You Have a Bunch of Cooks Illustrated Magazines/Books,"Obviously great tips, but they are cut out of the main Cooks Illustrated books and magazines. So you don't need this if you have the books and magazines. If you don't have the CI magazines and books, this would give you a ton of really great cooking tips which should save you time and money."
1,A Personal View,"I found this book depressing because the poems were not about how wonderful a dog can be or how an owner can come to love a dog deeply. I found the choices to be shallow. Some were difficult to read because of their language. Others were objectionable because of their word choice. In fact, I do not know any dog lovers who would enjoy this book. There are many poems about pets that are compelling to read, but this book leaves me cold."
5,Wodnerful history book,"This book is a must in Christian collection. The literary tone of the writer is very similar to that of the apostles, to that of a true Christian era follower of Jesus, and that is a jewel nowadays in literature.Eusebius is a survivor, so it is worth reading what he has to say.If you fall asleep, reading this book, it is all good. It just means you need more information still, to be able to appreciate the richness of it. Having said that, it is not really verbally dense. It's pure, real, and Christian!"
3,Buy the Penguin Books edition....,"The Penguin Books translation reads ""catholic and only true church"", but Paul Maier renders this ""universal and only true church"". Catholic does mean universal, but in the context Eusebius was clearly using it as a proper name, as the Church that was already everywhere rather than a regional sect. The Penguin Books edition has an introduction but that's it and then its a single narrative. This if I remember has introductions to each chapter which chop up the flow of things. Eusebius gives dates by Roman emperor and not the A.D. calendar so it can be hard to follow, but his effort is still the only surviving complete record of Church history for the first three huindred years. Important for the student, but like I said buy the Penguin Books edition."
3,Cover ripped,This book had some glue or something on the cover from packaging that I did not see. I pulled the book out and it ripped the cover some.
2,Too much edited out,"After discovering an older translation of this book at our library i decided i needed one for my own. I chose this newer translation but the parts that i was interested in on transitions from the first century church were not included. It has a lot of good information, but this edition is not complete or the older translator added stories of his own."
5,Eusebius alive and well,"In his usual fine style, Paul Maier has again given his readers an excellent addition to his recreations of the ancient world. This unusual collection of archaeological, literary, and art materials puts into focus a part of history that is usually neglected -- the history of the Christian church between biblical times and the early Christian writers. We are grateful to Paul Maier for his thorough scholarship and his sensitivity to the many facets of historical investigation.Norma W. Goldman, Wayne State University"
5,A superly presented classic Christian history resource.,"Paul Maier provides a new and welcome translation of the classic history by the first known Christian historian Eusebius (Bishop of Caesarea in Roman Palestine) which is wonderfully enhanced with charts, maps, and color photography. It is Eusebius who informs us as to what happened to Jesus' disciples later in life; when the Gospels were written, who wrote them, and where; answers the question of Peter's arrival in Rome; reveals where John spent the reminder of his life; explains how the New Testament canon developed; and deals with how and why the early Christians were persecuted by Roman authorities, and much, much more. No parochial, personal, academic, or community library Christian history collection can be considered truly comprehensive without the inclusion of Eusebius: The Church History."
3,thank goodness for more trek,"With Nemesis pretty much ending in the split up of the Next Gen crew, one of the biggest disappointments I faced was having no more novels to munch through.Titan is the continuation of several familiar characters. Just enough, in fact, to successfully aid the transition from the Enterprise to Riker's new ship. Many of the new characters are interesting (although whimsical), but they suffer just a little bit from never having been on the screen.The writing/plot of this book is definitely the best of the three, but you wind up being hooked in enough to go ahead and partake of the second and third books.I'm just hoping the writing comes back up to par in the future, and I'm looking forward to more character development."
2,Characters undeveloped / Weirdly PC,"I absolutely agree that there were too many characters in this book. The 6 factions fighting over Romulus were waaay too many, considering that we spend the majority of our time from the perspective of the Titan crew, we really learn very very little about the Romulans, which ultimately makes the intrigue a little boring.One reason there are so many characters is because Titan is supposed to be the ""most diverse"" crew yet. One of the things I like about Star Trek is that this is usually taken for granted. Here it it's not. In this book, we see Deanna harping Will about being more tolerant, and the crew reacting badly to one particularly different member. It's always in the context of the crew quickly getting over it, but I just found it painful.The characters weren't developed enough or real enough to pull off this kind of interspecies conflict on the ship."
4,Better condition then listed,"Have not read the book yet, I have others, both in the greater star trek universe series, as well as other genres ahead of it on my reading list, but I knew I would need it because my local library system has no copies of it.The condition of the book is better then it was listed, appearing to be unread as there are no spine wrinkles.I like this purchase & recommend it."
4,"Good, not great.","This is a well-written story, well above average for the Star Trek genre, but is far from the most gripping Star Trek story I've ever read. Solid, worthwhile read but nothing special. I do give it credit for managing the cliffhanger ending in a better-than usual, acceptable way: the main plot for this book was over, properly providing a conclusion, and the cliffhanger ending is essentially a result of an epilogue that gives us a preview of the next story."
4,Good start to a Trilogy,"Although the authors spend a great deal of time in this opening book of a trilogy doing character development, once the action begins, it gets pretty interesting and the uniqueness of the characters becomes important. ST fans should enjoy this saga about Riker's first assignment as a captain on a vessel whose purpose is much different than Enterprise, but where circumstances change the nature of the first mission."
3,A good start,"A good start to what is hopefully a good series of books. There will be a lot of good plot material developed out of the premise that the crew of the Titan is predominantly non human, even non humanoid. There is even a homosexual crew member thrown in to make sure the crew is as diverse as it is possible to make it."
2,I had a hard time getting through the writing style.,"I have been reading a lot of ST books lately. I purchased the first three books of this series, looking forward to reading all three.The writing style of ""Taking Wing"" is not one that I would start a book series with. I found it incredibly hard to get through, not at all like the usual ST book. Things like: ""the question took him off guard, forcing him to grope blindly for an answer"" describing normal conversation between Riker and his wife Deanna. In hindsight, I have to question how this passed the editor's muster.The plot isn't terrible, and the book is somewhat entertaining, but if I were a new ST reader, I would go for one of the other series of books, like the Vanguard series lead-off, by David Mack called Harbringer.This book is okay, I would have preferred a different writing style, without the sickly syrup writing...."
3,Character Study,"I am a long-time reader of Star Tek novels. I read Taking Wing as it is the introduction to the new Titan series featuring Will Riker as captain of the Titan. The concept for Titan is good but this book spends far too much content on the introduction and development of its cast of characters at the expense of its story line. While I realize that a series introduction novel needs to introduce and familiarize the reader with the new characters, it does not have to bore the reader with a tremendous amount of information on each one. I would have preferred more time spent on the advertised story line about working with the Romulans than on incessant crew conversations in the mess hall or time in their quarters. Nonetheless, the book is an OK intro for the series...at least you'll know the characters when you are finished!"
1,Political correctness shoved down throat,"I love Star Trek! So I decided to try a new novel after being away from Trek books for awhile. I could not even finish this book. Star Trek was all about unity and working together without shoving the concept down your throat. It was happening and you liked it or left.This book goes out of its' way to show you how nice everyone works together plus there are lectures to those who are not politically correct. If you have a hard time talking to something that looks like a nightmare out of your worst dreams then you must have missed a class in the Starfleet Academy! Even if you did talk to the lifeform you should not have flinched!Then there was the ""look how much work we are doing on our starship to make other life forms happy chapter!"" arrgghhhMaybe I'm not ready for the next gerneration of the next generation. I should stick with the original series.Live long and ProsperGordon"
3,Star Trek Titan Taking Wing,"The plot setting is appropriate. The writing style gets the story off too slowly. The author handles the elements between the Admiral and the new Captain Ryker well. The Reman story elements seem too passive for what they have gone through. Most other avid Star Trek fans will want the future stories to more more quickly for the series to become popular. I have started reading Articles of the Federation. It is not clear if this novel is meant to precede Star Trek Titan. I will read Star Trek TItan:The Red King when it comes out to see if I will follow this series.LCDR Holoboski, USN RET."
4,Study of Australian animals,Down Under (Animal Trackers)I bought this for my son's Montessori school where they are studying Australia and Oceana this semester. The book has nice drawings and lots of information about the unusual creatures found in Australia. It makes a nice addition to the curriculum. There are a couple animals I had not heard of before so I think this is a really good informative book.
2,it just soso,"I'm sorry. Even thought I really like Ms. Montgomery, I didn't like this movie. Just my opinion"
4,Pink Tourmaline ring,"This is a pretty ring. On the plus side, the fit is perfect, the stones are right-sized for the price and the company does everything possible to make sure you are happy with your purchase. The rings from this company (Finejewelers) come in a choice of gold color and you just choose your size and they create it. I would buy from them again. I was a little disappointed that the picture that was shown was quite a bit larger than what arrived in the box but that is typical of on-line jewelers. Also, I was expecting a more fuschia-colored stone but I believe I would have paid more for it."
1,I don't like this book.,"I think this book is poorly written, although it is obvious the author used a lot of time and tactics to write it. First, the author like to use a lot of you-may-see-it-once-in-your-life words in his description, some words aren't even in the dictionary. I used online Webster dictionary, not a elementary school student dictionary. As an example, can anybody tell me what ""co-optation"" means in English? Second, the whole book doesn't have a string to pull together, which make it very hard to read. If not for class, I will stop reading on the front page. Therefore, I don't like this book."
5,THE BEST MEXICAN ROL GAME,"HEY, i'm gona talk about this book, this is an increible book whit a fantastic guide to play the best role game in the world, you can make a lot of monsters, the increible items you have in your dreams, and a million of histories to play, the only you need is a few players, a pencil, some paper, and a lot of imagination. Here you can find the basic to play rol, and an adventure to begin, then you can still playing with your friend whit other adventures you create, i have the pleasure to have this, and if i will have to buy it again i'll do it. Come on, buy this book and enjoy the magic of the role play games."
4,1st of a great action/adventure read!,"I read and still have all 6 of this mini-series that is still an enjoyable read in the action/adventure genre. The world is an a post-holocaust state and people live in biospheres. A military armored unit led by an american captain named Abe Creighton go out of the bioshere into mutant and marauder-filled Africa, to find a mystery man named SHONA who exerts fearsome power. The pace is fast and furious with colorful characters. A must read for action fans!"
2,Yellow rod post insulators,These insulators are rubbery and elastic feeling causing the threads to slip if tightened too much. Otherwise they are fine.
4,ok but,Good enough for my back yard garden. Hard to tighten up tight though. When you twist them hard they just make a snapping noise and it slips a thread. Holds up against our 12 pound puppy. I question if it would hold up against a horse or a bull though.
5,Este cd está brutal!,Las canciones son buenas pero es muy temprano para hacer un gratest hits (será que van a romper)
5,A Treasured Memory,"I don't know what the first reviewer was expecting, but this is indeed Lawrence Welk and his ochestra and singers. My parents had the album set from which these were taken and they sound just as good now as they did when I was a child.For anyone who likes the old time Christmas songs, this CD is a must."
1,22 Merry Christmas Favorites by Lawrence Welk is a Fraud,"I expected to hear the orchestra of Lawrence Welk, you know, the band leader on TV. Instead it is a very poor imitation. The orchestra does not match his, and the songs are sung by different artists than the ones on my cherished LPs. I have checked the CD cover inside & out, and the artists on your CD are never credited. Very disappointing, and very deceptive marketing and packaging."
5,Realistic combat for the streets,"This is really the best book ever written about boxing for self-defense. Well organized and written in a literate and entertaining manner, it presents the boxing skills that work best in real combat and sensibly assesses the weaknesses of boxing and other forms of fighting. It also presents a fully articulated training program for the developing fighter. There's really nothing else like it -- and serious martial artists will assimilate its lessons so as to make their own styles that much more effective."
4,"Basically, how to box.","I am a former golden gloves boxer. I am also a traditional Chinese Internal martial arts practitioner. If you are looking for fast results to deal with an immediate threat, then this book is for you. Beaumont teaches you how to hit HARD. And it is effective for street defense. Oh I know that a lot of my peers will disagree with me. Sure If I haul off and hit someone closed fisted to the face, my hand will probably break, but his face will be demolished and I have a better chance of running away with a broken hand than he does with a mutilated face. I do think that Beaumont short changes the Asian martial arts too much but it is probably based on his exposure to the westernized martial arts we have here which in my opinion are missunderstood and as a result-dumbed down. With that aside it is an informative book on generating external power."
5,Very inciteful...,"The book was quite amazing. Several other who reviewed the book made disparaging remarks about Beaumonts thoughts on Eastern Martial Arts. Having studied Eastern Martial arts for two decades, I'm sorry to contradict them. Ned's views are actually pretty accuarate. A huge number of the arts lack a unified attack/defense strategy (the ability to attack and defend with the same motion instead of having your limbs moving seperately to accomplish the same task and thereby divinding your attention and causing both attack and defense to be structually weakened because of it). A large number also lack the understanding of body mechanics to place your body weight behind a blow without unbalancing yourself. Ned provides information that martial artists could use to adapt there own styles to, and includes moves and tactics their style do not have a counter part to. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
5,Boxing trainer,"I am a boxing trainer and historian, I collect boxing training manuals and this is one of the most useful ones I have in my collection. Many of the techniques in this book I use when I teach my people how to fight, excellent information and presented in a logical manner."
4,You need Practice..A Grapplers advice,"From a Grapplers stand point this is cream knowledge for a guy that does know how to strike. I'm a grappler, I rearely strike, but striking is part of the game. Well When I picked up this book I expected somthing different. What I got was a technical book explaining the priciples of boxing. I'm really not a fan of eastern martial arts (being that I practiced Karate for years) Beumount seems to share my sentament. The book gives a good history lesson, and ""Lessons from the Champ"" that explain the reason why Beumount endorses his plan of action. Fom experience Beumount gave better advice in one book on Boxing than 4 years of American Karate blending with ""Boxing Concepts"" gave to me...If your a Grappler or a Martial Artist Buy this book and Practice these techs..If your a boxer you probally aready know about this...but It's still a good read."
5,Best book on Boxing Ever!!!!,This book andJack Dempsey's Championship Fighting: Explosive punching and aggressive defenseare the absolute best books on boxing and how to throw explosive punches. While this book doesn't cover defence that well his second book does.My boxing has dramatically improved since reading this book because of how well it explain the sport of boxing and how it can be applied to self defence.
4,Add Boxing to your Martial Art. Improve your Boxing.,Yes this book is good. Yes this book is worth getting. Ned does not understand Asian Martial Arts but he understands boxing. There is a funny mistake when he uses E=mc2 (Einstien's formula for converting mater in into energy) to explain punching power - but then he was not that far wrong Newton's Force = Mass x Velocity2 was the right formula and his principle was correct (Increase your speed x 2 = Increase your punch power x 4). Principles of Boxing are well explained (Something that is hard to come by). Good Training routines are suggested. Very good section on combinations. Boxing is an extremely effective martial art - this book has greatly increased my understanding. I would give it five stars if Ned did not have such a chip on his shoulder.
5,THE NUMBER ONE IN SELF DEFENCE/STREET FIGHT,"This book is going to be the all time number one, if you are looking for REAL self defence and street fighting and you are man enough to want to be in a real street fight, then get this book. Watch out for me you Black Belters------SEE YOU IN THE STREET."
2,Boxing as THE martial art?,"As a student of kickboxing, tai chi, muay tai, and various other martial arts, I was surprised by this author's lack of respect for forms of self defense other than his chosen boxing. While I found his discussion of boxing techniques thorough and helpful, I was put off by the tone of this book and some of his derogatory terms (he actually uses the word ""pansy"" at one point). One of the first things a student of any martial art learns (or should learn) is not to underestimate his or her opponent -- by negating the effectiveness of kicks, etc. in fighting, as well as by generalizing about the qualifications of martial arts instructors, I think this author does a disservice to his readers."
4,"Right on boxing, wrong on martial arts","Beaumont has written a very good book on boxing, though photographs would have help illustrate some of the techniques. Where Beaumont gets himself in trouble is by lumpimg all (Eastern) martial arts together. All martial arts are not the same, just like all governmental systems are not the same. I enjoy living in a democracy but would not feel the same about living in a communist/totaliterian country. Hence, there are some exellent systems for self defense,i.e. kali/escrima, JKD, muay thai, and some systems that are better for sport and health as in Tae Kwon Doe & Tai Chi. Further, he is a little contradictary in the book for while he puts down martial arts in favor of boxing, he admires Bruce Lee who is probably the most recognizable martial arts figure in the world. But all in all, a reader will get a lot out of this title, and I look foward to reading his latest work on wresting."
5,Clark's Octavia Clog,"I have a problem with wearing any type of shoe that has a heel, but these shoes are extremely comfortable, and I have worn them all day shopping at the mall. So, to me, that is perfection!"
4,Nice multi-purpose shoe,"I really like this clog because it can be dressed up or down, skirts or pants look great with it. It ran a little wide for me (1/2 size smaller would have worked better)so I use a light insole in it. I got the peanut color - nice neutral for fall."
2,It's not EC...,"I was hoping to hear EC doing some of great works on the Strat or His Gibson J-45 or maybe even His Signiture Martin But NOPE. It's just a bunch of Studio or Session Musicians doing Cover's of EC's work. If You enjoy just good Music and don't mind that it not the Artist Themself's then this is a nice CD. Buy It, You'll love it, But if Your like Me, I want the Real Artist playing their Music. I'm a big Eric Clapton and back in the 70's when I was a Studio Musician, I got to sit in and Play with Him so to Me if it's not EC, I'm just not in to it."
1,Mastering/production problem,"I must agree with the previous reviewer. There is something terribly awry with the production of this CD. It sounds as if the range of the A/D converter which copied the original source was overdriven, or some other such digital distortion. It is definitely not an artifact of the rather old source material, it's something that went wrong in the CD production process.Terrible terrible terrible quality, which is too bad considering that the music itself is wonderful.The other two CDs in this series do not suffer the same problem, and have some really great songs on them."
3,Not what I expected,"I expected a Fred Astaire/Jane Powell collection but instead there were only two movie of the two of them and the rest were very random movies, most in poor quality."
2,Misleading Title,"Like another reviewer, I assumed by the title this would be a collection of movies including the titled pair. Wrong! Only one movie (Royal Wedding) had the pair of them. One other with Fred Astair & 2 others with Jane Powell.The connection with the 2 remaining films was meant to be comic relief. Say what? A TV version with Red Skeleton looked like it was made by using a movie camera & filming a poor quality TV. The remaining one is meant to be a funny Western. Disappointed. Again, the Title is very misleading."
5,"Wonderful book, makes you appreciate your own life","Great book. I saw the movie The Sessions, which only covers a short period of Mark's life. This book gives you details of his youth and his college experience at UC Berkeley."
5,Compelling Story,"While a recent film (The Sessions) and documentary (Breathing Lessons) have been made, this autobiographical story, authored by Mark O'Brien, is the one that grabs you and doesn't let go. Despite his severe handicaps, Mr. O'Brien goes to college (UC Berkeley!) and becomes a journalist, writer and poet. The book goes into detail about his experiences growing up, his transition to a nursing home (a nightmare), college, and beyond. We all cope with challenges in our lives. But the challenges this man copes with and overcomes, leave you reeling and evaluating life."
5,"Thanks, Mr. O'Brien","Having watched this most amazing self-filmed movie, it amazes me that the movie doesn't deal with the incredible successes during his life rather than sex. Wow, this is a marvelous autobiography!"
4,Great Read,This book was very interesting. A great read. His story is simply amazing. Well-written and so easy to get through.
4,Helpful brief commentary,Commentary is helpful for quick reference a la Cliff's notes and for a decent understanding of the work but too superficial for an in-depth study of the text.
1,he Sucks,"This Megatron should be called ""dwarf Popsicle"" megatron to warn people who #1 don't want all this icicle crap hanging off Megatron, and #2 don't want their Megatron to be dwarfed by Ironhide, ratchet, Starscream, etc. This figure is about the size of a deluxe class. I took all the ice decorations off including the wings, and he still looks bad. The color scheme looks like it was designed by a three year old. his arms are pitifully scrawny, like he's on a diet or something. his face is ok except for a black blotch around the mouth area like he's been drinking tar. The vehicle mode is ok but i am overall ashamed to own this toy and ashamed of hasbro for completely screwing up megatron. I will be purchasing movie leader premium series megatron, and when i do, I will be taking a can of spray paint to this thing!"
4,"Interesting, but not very creative","The odd part about this incarnation of Megatron is that he still looks a lot like a jet when he is in robot mode....and he still looks a lot like a robot when he is in jet mode. Not a whole lot of creativity went into this particular toy, but sometimes the simplest toys are the best. This one transforms quite easily, but my feelings are that it is a little bit too simple. There are no parts that fall off, but the one issue I did have with it is that the feet don't stay flat in robot mode. The springs tend to snap shut, and that makes him a little bit difficult to pose in robot mode. Altogether, I'd say he is one of the better toys from the Transformers Movie line. Watch out for price gouging, though. This one is available at most retail outlets for around $20."
5,Very pleased,I purchased the Megatron transformer for my grandson his 6th birthday.It was a perfect size and great condition he now wants the optmis one.Very pleased with all the products I have purchased from Amazon.
4,Cool Toy...could of done ALOT better however,"I've had this Megatron for about 4 or 3 years. He would of been great if Hasbro didn't put so much damn Ice all over him. His own wings are made of ICE FOR PEACE SAKES! The detail is alright, and the artictulation is nice. All and all, its a good figure...just could of done better."
4,Useful,I purchased this tent for the sole purpose of tail gating at Cleveland Browns games. We use it as a make shift bathroom...lol It was very useful and I do recommend the tent to others especially for this purpose. My only regrets are the fact it is top heavy and call fall over easier because we are on cement and there is no place to dig the poles into the ground. If the tent had feet it would be much better. Besides that it is great!
4,Good little shower/bathroom tent,The perfect little shelter for use as a shower or bathroom enclosure while out in the great outdoors. We use this for a shower enclosure using a Zodi Hot Tap Single Burner Travel Shower to heat and pump the water for us. I rated it down one star as this is a bit of an effort to put together and it takes three hands to get in erected. More expensive models pop up easier but this works just as well once assembled.
1,Partial Review,"I only own the earlier ""Mythical Beings"" by the same author; but to the best of my ability to tell, the ""Mythical Characters"" part of this book is identical to that earlier book; so I am only reviewing that part of ""Origami Sourcebook"".Here's what's good: these are lovely models by well-known and -respected origami artists. But that's all... the diagrams, presumably drawn by the author, are quite frankly terrible. It is possible for an experienced origamist to successfully create the models from these diagrams and instructions, but they are as much hindrance as help. I have so far finished the witch/wizard and Shiva models and am working on the long-tailed dragon and Cerberus models, but in every model I have done so far I have found multiple mistakes in the diagrams and instructions. If you like these models, I would suggest you seek the diagrams elsewhere."
2,Grab Bag,"As its title indicates, the value of Jay Ansill's ""Origami Sourcebook"" is not its originality, but the diagrams of models not easily available elsewhere. Mr. Neale's pleasing though simple dragon and a charming witch/warlock duo are two standouts. Diagrams are not always clear, so a bit of experience helps to interpret them. Color photos, while attractive, are not instructive, since the style of folding can perhaps best be described as expressionistic."
2,Not for beginners,"This book is for advanced folders. The direction are unclear and assume the reader has advanced knowledge of origami. While the projects are quite elegant and beautiful, they require a lot of practice to execute."
3,"Expected a variety of old hip-hop, didn't get it.","out of the whole cd, maybe there was 3 songs that I really liked. A lot of Bad Boy or Bad Boyish kind of songs, rappers, groups. That wasn't what i was looking for."
3,What happened to all the music?,"This set has three cds in it with supposedly 20 different songs on each. Mine did not. It has three cds, yes. However, every cd has the same songs on them. What a disapointment. I contacted the company directly a couple of weeks ago and have not heard back."
5,Beautiful Music for Workplace,I have these CDs playing softly in the background of my office. I always receive compliments on the music. All the music is all instrumental (i.e. no words sung). The benefit to this is that I can worship the Lord without offending others of differing faiths.
3,The TV episode in print,"One by one, the earlier four incarnations of the doctor are being plucked out of the space-time continuum, and placed into the dreaded Death Zone. Originally used by the Time Lords for organizing gladiatorial matches between various races, Rassilon closed the Death Zone, and forbade the use of the Time Scoop. So, who is doing this, and more importantly, why? It's up to the Doctor (all of them) to figure it out.This Doctor Who book is based on the episode of the same name. Although ""based on"" might be generous. This book is the episode in print, which means that it does not contain any surprises for anyone who has seen the show. That said, it is an exciting, well-written book, and I enjoyed it immensely."
5,"Van Morrison ""What's Wrong With This Picture"" used CD","I loved but lost this CD, and it's about $50.00 to replace new. (Blue Note Records)But the used one from Amazon for $2.99 was perfect! It included original liner notes in the original pkg., and played flawlessly. Thanks Amazon!"
5,Van The Man,"I like Van Morrison. I bought it, played it one time and liked it immediately. This is the best thing he has put out in years.If you don't like this CD then you don't like good music.Bravo VM."
3,Let the Whinin' Boy Moan,"The three stars is based on Van-scale, otherwise it might be more like 4 stars.As a fan of Van's more reflective, poetic, mystical and even bright, exuberant sides, I hated this album when it came out. It just seemed like a long, dull, bitter complaint. His soul was not very open here. But picking it up today, I appreciate it more for what it is -- a no frills, but rather tight retro R&B; album. So just ignore the lyrics to the sad-to-be-van songs (unless you're feeling po'd and disillusioned about how bad fame sucks) and groove to the blues.Turns out the whinin' boy moans pretty good."
4,more of the same ol'...and there's nothing wrong with that,"I'm givin' it only four stars because it lacks the soul altering, once a decade , masterpiece like'Madame George', 'Listen To The Lion, or 'Healing Has Begun' for examples. That aside, it's another soulful,jazzy (in the good sense) workout for The Man and his always excellent sidemen. Sure he's still grumpy about fame (or lack of it or whatever), but the grumpiness is all in the lyrics, and I suggest you ignore what he's singing about and just enjoy the singing.There's not a stinker in the bunch and Van fans will treasure it. Newcomers might want to start elsewhere (St. Dominics Preview is an excellent starting place).Fans of soulful,bluesy, heartfelt singing however can start anywhere in the man's canon and be rewarded.Right here included."
4,van's voice is still healthy,"After so many years and so many albums, it is amazing to me that morrison's chops are still as good as they were when he sang with THEM.WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE is every bit as good as MOON DANCE and TUPELO HONEY.If you are thinking of christmas gifts, this would be a good one for anybody you know who enjoys van morrison."
2,Disappointing,"I found this CD disappointing, and I allow Morrison plenty of cushion as he's my favorite all-time male vocalist.I much preferred his previous CD, *Down the Road*. ""Picture"" rehashes tired, reoccurring themes, such as those damned record folks who make his life miserable, and another paean to a particular season or month. Few, if any, musical hooks, and not any song I immediately want to hear again.Pretty good background music, I guess."
3,I agree with Paul Duffy,"Van has had flashes since Hymns to The Silence.(I do not even hear a flash on this one) But, he has not done anything even CLOSE to a great or even very good album by his standards. I still enjoy this one, and the last on and the one before that.....I find it quite odd to see all of the tv commercials for this album. I have never seen a Van Morrison tv commerical."
2,Far From his Best,"I have listened to this CD a couple of times now, and wonder why some reviewers liked the album so much. Three decent tracks, Once in a blue moon, St. James Infirmary, and the title track. Otherwise the CD is barren, and far from Van's best.Complaining about fame seems a bit odd to me-it's not like he's a superstar-the equivalant of Don Adams or Barbara Feldon bitching ...I have liked most of his albums-Into the Music or Astral Weeks can be argued to be some of the strongest efforts in the history of pop. I like almost all his 80s albums and therefore he is probably only the only 60s star who continued to put out outstanding efforts decades later. Yet since the early 90s his efforts have all been subpar. He seems to have abandoned the celtic background his music has had since the late 70s and he has not found anything adequate to replace it."
2,Going through the motions,"This isn't as bad as the garbage tracks Morrison did to get out of his Bang recording contract (nothing like ""Ringworm"" in this collection), but this is not even a mediocre Van release. I like most of his releases, even COMMON ONE, INARTICULATE SPEECH, and BEAUTIFUL VISION. Here, Van just seems commited to getting the ""product"" out on time. DOWN THE ROAD was much stronger, and DAYS LIKE THIS."
5,He Just Keeps Getting Better,"Once again I have to marvel at the genious of this man. This album is a jewel. It combines blues, jazz, rock-a-billy and numerous other strains of music into an entrancing CD which captures your ears from the first track to the last. What continues to amaze is the freshness of Van Morrison's music; it is timeless because it is great music. Buy this CD and enjoy."
3,Give It A Rest,"Just too many songs(5)complaining about fame..this started back at least with ""Hymns to the Silence"". Need to take your own advice and get on with the show...Listen, if it wasn't for ""fame"" an old bald fat short guy like you wouldn't be getting the first class chicks you do..so put it in perspective...the only stand out cuts for me are St. James Infirmary, Little Village and Stop Drinking...the rest is a pretty good groove and pleasant and all..in a thoughtful jazzy mode..unpretentious except for the aforementioned lyrics... time to move on..the last CD (Down The Road) was far superior in every respect..(tho it too had a couple songs about fame...)"
5,"Great bag, great price!","this bag is exactly what I was looking for! I needed an XL bag and this one delivered. It is made with the targus quality, My last targus bag lasted for 7 years, and I don't expect anything less from this one! In stores this bag retailed on clearance for 80$ got this for half that price with shipping included. I expected it to arrive in about 10 days and it showed up on my door the very next day! I know the shipping time has nothing to do with the quality of the product, it was just an added bonus to receive it so fast!"
4,I recommend this product AND company!,I was very pleased with the quality of this product as well as the service and speed with which I received it.
5,really large bag!,"A good and very large bag. I'm travelling by plane a lot, and in this bag you can store all your small and bigger handluggage items you wish to. Also, my laptop is safely stored and close to my back, so that it's not too heavy. There are so many compartments in the bag that you can store things in a way which enables you to find everything back very easily, without the need to store everything in one compartment, where you can't find a thing anymore, afterwards.I'm really satisfied with this bag. The only complaint could be that it's almost too big!"
5,"Targus XL 17"" Notebook Backpack","My wife and children purchased this backpack for me as a Father's Day present and it is awesome! My job requires that I travel and with that comes having to carry a 16"" Dell laptop, power pack and various other items that one takes on business trips. Let me just say that this backpack held them all with PLENTY of room to spare. It is comfortable to carry, has plenty of padding in all the right spots and seems to be well put together. The bag has seven zippered compartments and a mesh side net which can easily hold a 20 oz. bottle of your favorite beverage. However, you need to remember which pockets hold which items, because it can get confusing at times to keep track of where everything is!"
5,great backpack!!,"i needed a backpack for my 19"" laptop (bought this bag in 2009) and i am extremely happy with my purchase. when i first got this bag i didn't use it much, but back in school again and i have used it quite often. i'm 37 and a bigger woman (but short) and this bag is awesome. has great storage in the front, nice side pockets to transport your water bottle and a ""stretch type"" closing so i don't lose my bottle, holds it nice and secure. i have always been happy with purchases from amazon and this time i am very happy. it has lasted for a few years and hasn't shown signs of wear and tear---really holds up from weight of my laptop and school books being toted around and normal wear and tear. i don't abuse the bag, like toss it around like a rag doll, and it has made me happy with my purchase (well my dad's gift to me). if your looking for a backpack for you 19"" laptop and books with plenty of room and pockets this is the purchase for you!!!"
3,Picture is misleading....,"My only complaint is that the picture very clearly shows a cell phone/audio carrying case on the arm strap to the backpack and this is not included. It may seem drastic to dock 2 stars for that, but being that this is a feature that made me choose this backpack in particular, I'm very displeased and feel extremely mislead.EDIT: Due to suggestions I contacted Amazon and received a replacement, which was also missing the case in question. Amazon has refused to try again but offered me a 20% refund and let me keep the bag. I am GUESSING (no confirmation from any source) that Targus has discontinued the case and Amazon has not yet updated their description & picture. Buyer beware from here..."
5,Great Backpack For the College Student,"I am engineering student at Penn State, and with my hp zd8000 laptop, this backpack works great. I looked around before i bought it, but this seemed to be the best value, and most efficient. It can hold all of my huge physics book with room to spare, and the cd holder pocket in the front doubles nice as an extra battery slot. While i will say that the bag does not stand up level on its own (kinda annoying) the bag itself makes up for it with its capacity. It is well padded inside the laptop compartment, so you don't have to worry about damage to the computer, and it stays dry when it rains. Overall, I'd say that this bag is the best thing out there, unless you want to my big $$$ for something a little fancier that does the exact same thing just as well as this. Ideal for any Student with a heavy course load, and a 17"" laptop."
4,good buy,"I bought it for my 17 inch notebook and worked fine. Has too many compartments, but is a bit bulky because when empty it will sag a bit and wish it had one of those straps around the bag itself so that it wouldn't sag. Carried a ton of things in it and after my 1st trip thought that some of the stitches would slowly be stretched, or some compartment inside tear a bit, but nope, this product is sturdy enough. Its outer compartment again sags because the strap for it could have probably tightened it a bit more. I carried a projector, my camera bag (which in itself had an slr with lenses, digital camera, card reader, camcorder, tapes etc). All in all it carried a lot of things and still was compact enough for the people at the checkin counter not to bother me with the size or weight.The bag sags a little which is why I gave it 4 stars though can't blame it for the fact that it has so much space in it. If you want something really compact then you should chose something smaller."
5,Great Backpack!,This is a great backpack! It will hold my 17 in XPS laptop and still have plenty of room for all my accessories. I would recommend this backpack to anyone.
3,"Too big, not enough padding","This backpack is huge. My 17"" Powerbook seems dwarfed by it. Strangely, with all this room which could have been used for padding, padding and protection is minimal."
4,Rolling Notebook Case..pretty good,"I was having a hard time finding a bag to fit my new 17"" screen laptop. This bag fit the bill, wasn't expensive and seems sturdy. I only wish more information was included on what types of things go where. There are so many pockets and storage items, I'm a little lost. BTW...the delivery of this product was lightening fast, because I asked for standard delivery and it came the next day."
4,Worth It!,"Targus TXL717 17 XL Rolling Notebook CasePROS:This product is durable and functional. I have had it a month and it is a relief! It carries my computer, organizer, cords, files, checkbook, large business card holder, extra business cards, pens, et al. A real workhorse! And, the telescoping handle is long enough so I do not kick the bag all the time, like a lot of my luggage.CONS:The telescoping handle storage does not have a ""lining"" or ""separator"" from the file compartment... that's a bit tacky!"
5,Good deal!,"It's an excellent product, and through my point of view it protects my 17"" notebook very well, as well as there are a lot of space for carring pherifericals and other stuffs. It's really a big deal!"
4,18.4 inch laptop,The Targus XL rolling notebook case (model TXL717) will accommodate the HP HDX18t-1200-CTO laptop with its 18.4 inch screen.
1,Poor design.,"I had to replace my other Targus Bag, a 15.4 CityGear Chicago due to upgrading to a 17"" laptop. This bag ""looks"" almost the same, but there are a few major let downs. With such a large bag and with the designs of their other bags to go off of, I would have expected more pockets. I has numerous pockets already, but compared to my other bag, it's missing a few that would have been very convienent. The real let down though, is the design or lack of design between the smaller sections and larger section. My previous bag had elastic along between the sections on the sides that kept the smaller section in place, the lack of this on this bag allows the top 1/2 of the section to flop down and fold over even with the straps clipped. I hope they design a larger bag based on the 15.4 Chicago bag, becuase this one has a couple of major weaknesses ruining an otherwise great bag."
2,It's too big for me!,"I am 5'7"" and this backpack ate me up when I wore it. When I filled it, I couldn't even lift the backpack.Also a compartment ripped after using it for about 3 months."
4,Good college backpack,"I was shopping for a backpack for my son to use while he was away at college. The local stores did not have a large selection that would accommodate a notebook computer with a 17"" screen, and those I did find were fairly expensive. I know Targus has a good reputation, and this price was about 40% less than anything I could find locally. It has plenty of room and enough compartments to keep his school supplies organized. The photo shows a pocket on one of the shoulder straps for a cell phone, but the backpack that arrived did not have this. My son said this was no big deal and he was happy, overall, with the backpack."
5,Carried one of these for years all over the world as a Medallion flyer,"I was pleasantly surprised to see they still manufacture this packback. I've carried one of these literally all over the world for 10 years or so, its really taken a beating and finally wearing out. Big enough to carry anything you want and will flatten out to fit in the regional jets overhead bins. Multiple compartments with pockets here and there you can organize your stuff. Believe me I carry it, cameras, wipes, medicine, laptops, books, scuba gear, shoes, extra clothes, headphones, pens, iPhone(s), you name it, it fits. This is an awesome bag."
3,Great idea with crappy zippers,"This backpack has lots of pockets and generally is a decent pack; I can get my laptop, other work stuff and a three days worth of clothes into it, no problem. There are two issues with it that make it just ""okay"". First the zippers will open by themselves if they're not zipped around to the bottom (either end of the zipper track). Second, there's very little padding at the bottom of the laptop pocket. I solved this with a piece of foam, but shouldn't really have to for a pack that costs this much. Otherwise it's a good backpack."
4,Almost perfect,"This is a wonderful case and the price was amazing with the 57% discount. The only problem was that the velcro pieces fell off of one of the inside adjustable restraining straps, rendering it worthless until the velcro could be stitched back on. If I knew how to give this case 4.5 stars, I would."
1,Poor design and quality.,I purchase this backpack several months ago and I am very dis-appointed in the design and quality. The shoulder straps are poorly designed which make it difficult to ware the backpack for any length of time. The zippers just open on their own or just won't close. The pockets make it hard to organize items in the backpack.
4,A bit too big but solid.,"Overestimated the size of this bag but it doesn't diminish how good it is. Solid, plenty of space and easy to carry. Holds everything you could want to carry and more. Has turned out to be a great travel bag as well."
3,change my back pack,"Hello,I've got my backpack but this is so big (size) for me, Is it possible to change it to Large or medium size?Best regards,Sahar"
4,Overall impression,The bag has multi-functionality and good for travelling purpose however not much practical in day-to day laptop carrier.
4,Big Bag!,"This bag is huge! It holds everything and the kitchen sink. So, it can get really heavy really fast! Good product if that is what you want... I am currently looking for a smaller bag. When I do take it to school people ask if I am going camping! It is that big! If you are looking for a big bag this is the one. I have found it good for vacations. Yes, it had room for school books, but think of the weight it adds."
3,Lots of room Bad Design,"Lots of room, straps are strong, not sure why one of the front flaps is just hanging by two click on straps, it would be better if it had a zipper.if you add any weight to any of the pockets in that area of the bag, it just flaps and it fold over itself, inside the mentioned flap you have these two mesh holders, not sure what they are for either,instead of having so much extra room on the computer side of the bag, it should have a bit more padding to protect the computer better overall the bag is well made, just needs some improvements to make it an excellent bag"
5,WONDERFUL,"This was the backpack that saved me. I'm a college student, and I'm kinda poor. I carry around my laptop and all of my books everywhere I go. When you have lower back problems, a backpack that can carry things around all day, is reasonably water resistant, and doesn't destroy your back is like a miracle from the clouds. This is a great backpack, and it's hard to get ""Full"". Love it."
4,"Spacious, but needs more pockets.","I purchased this backpack when my new notebook would not fit in the Swiss Army Computer Backpack that I already owned. Overall for organization, the Swiss Army is far superior.The Targus backpack has plenty of room, but is somewhat lacking in two areas.1. Lack of padding in the Computer sleeve (I actually added padding at the bottom of the sleeve and between the computer and the side of the pack that rests against your back).2. Lack of compartments. The compartments in the backpack are spacious, but lack the organization capabilities (for all the small stuff that you carry with your computer) that exist in the Swiss Army pack.Overall I like the pack and it does the job, but you'll need to add padding to the computer sleeve and I'm still looking for a solution to organize the accessories that I carry."
2,Big Problem for Travelers (TXL717XL),"If you are a ""road warrior"" and need a bag that is your mobile office for to/from the office and on travel, this is NOT the bag for you: IT IS TOO WIDE TO FIT DOWN THE AISLE OF AN AIRPLANE!The dimensions of this bag are all wrong. It is much wider than similar models, allowing the laptop to go in sideways with extra room on the side for cables, etc. While that is a good feature for the laptop section, it turns out to waste space in the folder section. Once you load all your files in, there is about 6 inches of dead space on the side. What you really need is a bag with less width and more depth so that you can roll it down the aisle of the plane and fit more folders/papers inside.Overall it is too big and the wrong shape and you'll be very irritated when you end up lugging your wheeled bag through the airplane."
4,Very good Backpack :),"I purchased the ASUS G73 laptop, it comes with a 17.3"" screen and you know that your options are limited with this size of a laptop. This item was a great value for what its worth, it has tons of storage place, great space to secure your laptop. The waist support helps a lot when you are carrying and item this big. There are 2 things that would like to see in this backpack. The first is to have a special place where you can secure your charger because right now it bounces all over the place and it gets uncomfortable. The second is to have a more padded back support. Other than that it is a great item very good quality and would absolutely recommend buying."
2,Defective handle,This item came with a broken handle and honestly did not seem to be very soundly assembled. The nylon material feels flimsy. It also looks a bit cheap in my opinion. I ended up returning and getting a similarly priced Solo which was a huge upgrade. The Wenger model is probably the best but you pay top $ for it. Overall I was not that impressed by the Targus bag and would be hard pressed to recommend purchasing it over other brands.
5,Great on your back,"The bag is great. I carry a laptop, several manuals, cables, adapters etc, etc etc. I also have to walk long distances to our field cabinets. A typical laptop bag kills my back. I can walk all day long with this bag on my back with no back pain at all!"
5,Excellent pack,"I bought this from Amazon in 2006. It's now 3+ years later. I use it EVERY DAY, since I drive between locations for work. During the week, it carries my wide-screen laptop and TONS of paperwork with no trouble. When I have to fly, I strap it onto my back so I can make the mad dash to catch my connection. On many weekends, I empty it and use it for a day pack when hiking. So far, only one zipper has gone bad permanently...the small one on the very front where there's a slot for business cards..no big deal. The right strap is showing some wear (I usually sling it over my right shoulder). Overall, a durable pack that can take alot of rough treatment, and which has plenty of padding to protect your computer when dropped."
4,"BIG, but works","The backpack is very big, but for people that carry everything plus the kitchen sink, it works"
2,"It's big, but not well made enough for everyday use.","I bought this for my Toshiba gaming laptop. This is the only bag after a lot of searching that will fit that particular laptop. The bag holds it fine, but I am now having to reinforce the stitching on the bag. The seams are starting to separate after just four months of using it three days a week.I had a XL Swiss Army bag for my last laptop, but it would not hold this particular unit. If they start making a Swiss Army bag that can hold the new gaming laptops, I will buy it and retire this bag. Right now, if you have a gaming machine, this particular bag is the only choice out there. Just be aware that the seams around the top will more than likely start coming apart."
5,Met Expectations,"I have had this bag for 3 weeks now. I was worried because of other reviews that I read about buckles and zippers breaking, but so far so good. I got it because of the price and it was one of the few bags that fit my HP HDX18 18"" laptop. It fits it just fine with plenty of room for all accessories. The front pack that connects at the bottom and snaps in at the top is kind of hokey...to get to something you have to unhook it and I would rather it just not be there, although it does add three more compartments. If anything was going to break it would probably be the two clips on the front pack. With the bag and the large laptop together sometimes I feel like I am going camping because of the weight/size, but that is to be expected with such a large laptop. Overall, I think for the price it is a high quality bag that I would recommend."
3,Really big for small people,"I own the Targus Lite bag (not backpack) and wanted a bigger bag because I have a 17"" laptop now and it doesn't fit. This bag held the laptop and all of my files and stuff with much room to spare. But, it is very, very large and since I am only 5'1"", I couldn't fit it comfortably on my back. If you need a ton of space and you are taller than me, this pack may work for you."
3,"holds large laptop, but too complicated","I bought this for a 17"" company-issued laptop; the over the shoulder bag was too much for one side. I like it - inexpensive and much nicer than the standard Dell bag.My critiques:- It is much bigger than the laptop, so the bag could have been a bit smaller- The cell phone holder hits me in the face when i put the bag on (so i keep my treo in my front pocket).- There are 3 pockets that are sewn on the bottom but strapped on the top. this is just stupid, they should have been completely attached and the straps removed (extra doo-dads and gee-gaws are not cool).- There are 6 closed pouches with zippers and 4 open ones. Within the closed ones there are many sub-dividers. So you have to come up with a system for where you put your stuff or it will get lost in there. I would prefer 4 closed pouches and 2 open ones.I still prefer it and use it over the standard bag, but in this case, less would have been more."
5,Exactly what I was looking for!!!,"I was looking for a bag that would be large enough to carry files, my MacBook, iPad and hp laptop. My hp laptop in particular is oversized so I wanted a bag that would fit the computer. This bag was perfect for what I was looking for. It is well made, holds everything I need and has three different way to transport (rollers, large strap, and two well made handles). It was well worth the cost. The shipping was also very fast."
5,Works as advertised,"It's a bag. It holds stuff. If you don't pack it to maximum capacity, it will fit under the seat in front of you for most flights, and it's big enough to do this with room for a change of clothes, just in case you have a connecting flight after attempting to leave Philly on time.As a neat feature that I doubt I'll ever use, you can put an MP3 player in a side compartment and run headphones into it while the zipper is fully closed."
4,targus backpack,"So far so good. Just used for a trip to Florida. Plenty of pockets and room for a three day trip. Fits in overheads of planes easily.Becomes a little heavy if you load it up.(Laptop, clothes etc. )But it sits nicely on your back, even full.Would definitely recommend."
5,Targus TXL617 17 XL Notebook Backpack review,"Lots of space for my 17"" laptop and more. Durable and takes a beating.Its exactly what I wanted, with lots of pockets and space."
3,Good not Great,"For the most part this is a good backpack, and the other reviews summarize the product nicely. To be brief, it is very large, to me, too large to use everyday, but nice when traveling. I bought it as an everyday bag, but it really is just too big, so I only use it when traveling and need to carry extra stuff. The front flap is somewhat clunky and would function much better if it had fully enclosed sides or even zippers to secure the sides. The zipper pocket at the top of the front flap folds under and is difficult to use, and the two large mesh pockets behind the front flap would be much more useful if they were sealed.I use it occasionally, but I much prefer my SwissGearSwissGear Computer Backpack (Gray/Black)bag. I would not buy this particular bag again."
4,Tons of space,Targus TXL617 17 XL Notebook BackpackThis bag really has a lot of space. The quality is great! The only negative I've found is that the front pockets are held up with 2 buckles which makes the backpack expand out instead of up. So if you really stuff this backpack then it won't fit in the overhead compartment on the airplane without you squishing the backpack down and re-adjusting the load. Overall though I really like this backpack because I need the space it offers.
4,Awesome HUGE notebook bag,"This is an awesome bag and will fit a wide variety of products. It has lots of pockets and seperate comaprtments for all your stuff. The pouch for the NOTEBOOK is enourmous and will fit the largest notebook out there easily. However in that light the compartment was much to big for my 17"" MacBook Pro, about 3-4 inches on the side and 2inches on the top. In that light its still a great bag but just not going to wrok well if you have a MacBook, even with a sleeve on my computer the compartment was to big."
2,Useful for a time but then fell apart,"I was a traveling teacher a few years ago and used this to carry my laptop, gradebook, planbook and files, among other things in that one bookbag. This bookbag was very bulky and held quite a lot, especially in all of the compartments, but did not last long. After several months the inside fell apart. At the end of the school year I called Targus and sent it back and they exchanged it for an ergonomic messenger bag that held up for the following school year."
3,Not worth more than $40,"I bought this bag to replace a 15'' Targus backpack I have been using for 8 years. I have been carrying a 17'' laptop in this 15'' bag for the last 3 years. After 8 years, it still works flawlessly. I might replace the laptop with a bigger one, so I bought this bag for the large size.CONS:I now have two Targus bags, so I am able compare the quality between them. This new 17'' bag is thinner and has an inferior nylon feel when compared to my 8 year old Targus bag.There is no padding at the bottom.PROS:The large size can fit the biggest laptops made today. It can also be used to carry camping/hiking gears.Buy it if you have an over-sized laptop. If you have a standard size 17'' laptop, there are better choices."
5,Perfect for high schoolers carrying LOADS of books,"My high school aged daughter carries 40-60# of books to and from school. (the school used airline routing techniques for locker assignments). This backpack is VERY well made. The materials are strong and the construction is spot on. Sturdy tailoring and well lapped, taped seams.I couldn't be happier. If I ever decided to go back to college this backpack would be my FIRST purchase."
2,Lab top rolling case,"I am not happy with this rolling notebook case, while it holds my 17"" laptop, allowing me to wheel it in around the airport instead of carrying it, it is too large for some overhead storage on smaller planes, and size is too larger to comfortable pull from under the airline seat to get to the laptop. The front storage is limiting as it does not unzip to open completely, and has a pocket opening on the side that pushes into the inside of the bag blocking use of some of the internal pockets. The back storage area, near the handles, limits usable space for items although it does hold files and accessories for the laptop. The pocket in the center which holds the laptop does not unzip all the way either, but allows you to slid the notebook into the slot, it would be more useful if you could open these sections fully."
2,Handle Problem,"I read several reviews about this item. After a long search for a wheeled case with inside dimensions for a 17"" laptop, I made my purchase. It has sections for all your office needs including removable zip pouches, but after the first use the telescoping handle jammed and would not release. I manually pushed the clamp buttons to no avail, the inconvenience and awkwardness makes the case unmanageable. Quality control is absolutely lacking in this product."
2,wayyyyyyy too big,"I was looking to buy a fashionable backpack that had a sleeve for my 15.4"" widescreen HP Laptop. This backpack came within a few days of ordering and it is repulsive. It is really ugly and it is HUGE. It's like a piece of luggage, rather than a backpack... a cheap looking ond obtrusive piece of luggage. I am going to return it and pay the return shipping :(. I don't know how anyone would want to wear this in public on their back. My roommate has a Swissgear backpack with a laptop sleeve and it is smaller and a lot nicer to look at..."
3,RATING WOULD HAVE BEEN HIGHER BUT SHIPPING DELAYS,happy w bagtook an extra week to get.Wanted to have for a trip.It literally 2 days before I left town.
2,Cavernous but useless for organizing,"This is a very large backpack but not well designed. The snap-close front section snags on protruding objects in the environment. But the biggest drawback is it just has few big pockets and thing get lost in it. There is no key holder and no convenient place to put and quickly retrieve them. Also it is not well padded, either in the back section that rests on your back or the shoulder straps, or the waste belt. Reading glasses placed in a front pocket for easy access broke. It was uncomfortable and unwieldy."
2,"solid construction, the strap connection makes it unwearable","The product looked and felt solid. I really was looking forward to using this. However once i put it on, I knew I could not keep it. There is a U shaped connection inbetween the arm straps that hits RIGHT at the back of my neck. As if I dont have enough neck/eyestrain problems from working in the tech field....lets put something poking you right there in the back of the neck, WITH WEIGHT.I HAD to return it...and now I am paying a boatload for shipping it back and waiting forever for it to repost to my account. Boo!"
4,Nice backpack,I bought it to use with my notebook.But it is so cool that i use it for traveling too.Good space inside! And well divided.
2,Big enough but no padding,"This backpack is definitely big . . . I have one of the largest notebooks on the market and there is extra room on each side of the notebook pocket.The problem for me is that the amount of padding between the notebook pocket and the back of the pack is paper-thin . . . I need something more substantial to protect my notebook when it's in an overhead bin on a plane or wherever. Unfortunately I have to send this back.I've saw a large Targus backpack at Best Buy that appeared to be better quality, thicker padding, mesh, etc. I was thinking this was that model but evidently they make a cheaper version of their larger laptop backpack."
5,awesome,"Just what i wanted.I am a college student and this back pack can fit my books, laptop and gym clothes all at once..If you are travelling and need a big carry on bag, this back pack can do the work.But if you are not looking for something huge, be warned, this backpack is not for you!"
3,Targus XL BackPack,"The bag was a bit too big for my purposes and is also a bit too ""flimsy"". I have to balance all the items I carry so the bag doesn't constantly tip over and spill my documents and items out.Since I travel a quite a bit, I find that at times I have to check the bag in as it's doesn't meet the standard for some flights. A bit annoying as I have my laptop and other accessories stored in there.Overall, the bag is big, but it wasn't what I expected..."
4,Roomy Laptop Case With Class,"This review is for the top-loading portfolio case, I'm a business traveler and this bag is classy. This bag is also huge, you can put a 17"" laptop in and still have room to spare. The laptop area is adjustable to secure any size laptop or netbook. Plenty of pockets for laptop accessories and paperwork. The handles are plastic but they are comfortable. The side pocket is great for holding your phone or keys. This bag does have the luggage handle pass-through which is nice when travelling with roll-away luggage. One star off for the useless(too small) mesh accessory bags and their pockets, they get in the way of my paperwork."
5,good value,"I needed a replacement for my 7 year old Targus backpack. I tend to stuff things and this case easily accomodated everything I had in my backpack. Doesn't seem as heavy-duty as my old Targus backpack, but for the price, a decent value. Lots of pockets to arrange computer cables, files, etc."
4,Great backpack used as briefcase!,"Bought this for my husband who had just broken his 2nd LLBean briefcase. He is NOT easy on his briefcases because of the amount of work-related papers, books and laptop that he commutes with each day. He has said that it is very big and cumbersome while on the packed Metro train, but he still loves it. He's also now able to carry his lunch and workout clothes/shoes in the backpack even with his laptop and other work related items inside."
4,"fits a lot of stuff, but it's HUGE!","I got this as a present for my sister for Christmas. She loves it, but she's only 5'2"", so it looks like she's carrying a small child on her back. It has more than enough room for a 17"" notbook, and can probably fit enough clothing and travel items for a weekend trip. Wouldn't reccommend this if you are looking for a small backpack for everyday use (school,work)since it's so big."
4,Good bag for Large Laptops,"Purchased this bag after looking at it in a local store - even with shipping saved about $10.00. Very large bag but about the only backpack style that would hold a 17"" Screen laptop. Your small laptop would be lost in this.Good Bag with lots of space and good laptop compartment."
5,"Extensive, intensive traveler","This bag has been with me from Baghdad, Beirut and beyond. It has carried my 17"" notebook and assorted clothing, accessories and the like with comfort and unyeilding endurance. If you are a world traveler, who finds himself in all kinds of interesting conditions, this bag is for you!"
4,A great backpack!,"It's been a pain to find a good roomy bag for my extra wide 17.4"" laptop. I live in Sweden, and after a long search, both in stores and online. I finally gave up and ordered this bag from the US. (Targus only sells these in the US) And it's awsome!It's sturdy, well built, with smart compartments and room for everything.It's big, u really do fit everything in this, but on my back, it still looks like a pretty normal sized backpack.Im neither tall or big and it still looks good on me, and most important it's very comfortable even when fully loaded.The only downside is that theres no raincover! But that can be found online, so no biggie..I'm very happy with this bag and I highly recommend it! No regrets from me, even though the shipping cost as much as the bag ^^"
2,fell apart in 6 months had to buy something else,Gave one to my son for his laptop when he went into A school for Marines. This is not a field use situation more like what a collage student would experience. six months of use and it fell apart. He bought a briefcase style at the BX and it is holding up much better.
4,I guess you're just what I needed.....,"After researching the dreaded ""Backpack for ASUS G74SX"" I went ahead and dove in. I agree the the masses. TheASUS G74SX-A1 17.3-Inch Gaming Laptop - Republic of Gamersfills the mass padded back zipper, but leaves no room to spare in the padded section. However, I could fit at least 2 additional laptops with a tablet and other books etc...... The reason I had to find one that would fit it is because I bought the lappy from BestBuy and their version doesn't included the custom backpack that other G74's do. I matched this with aCorsair Vengeance M60 Performance FPS Gaming Mouse (CH-9000001-NA)mouse and this is a bad arce gaming rig for a pretty good price!!!"
4,Back packing it on the Harley,"I purchased this to backpack for work -- I ride my Harley to work in the summer. Given the price of gas -- I going to drive (ride) something more economical.Too cold so far for biking, but the bag appears to be a good deal for the dollars -- will post more when I have taken it down the highway a few times. Pilot"
5,Excellent Pack - Best one yet!,"I had a Maistro (?) was it, the last couple packs. The straps broke within a year and the material flaked out on my stuff in the pack.This Targus pack is the best pack yet!! And I've had a lot of packs. My bike is my main mode of travel and I use this pack every day. It's just as strong now as when I bought it about 6 months ago. The straps are strong, the material is tough (and looks good too. And no flaking on my stuff!!) I fully expect to have this pack for 10 years no problem. The zippers are good too. If you carry a lot of stuff, this is the pack for you. My experience with Targus is ""good quality""!"
3,Huge but awkward backpack,"I like the size of this bag. It's HUGE. It's almost the size of my carry-on suitcase. It throw tons of stuff in it and it will hold just about anything anyone would ever need on a trip, short or small. My 17"" Mac Book Pro fit nicely inside.The size, is also a problem though. If you have anything in the front pouches, the outer flap portion sags. Also, one has to be careful when opening the bag with stuff in the front-most pockets. It will flop open and be a general pain to look through and use. I solved this by bringing the waist strap around the front of the bag and pulling it down tight.It's not a bag I would recommend to anyone unless they needed a REALLY BIG backpack that happened to be suitable for a large laptop."
3,Searching The Compartments,"I've had mine for around three years. The zippers have stopped working on three of the compartments. The zipper closures good be beefier. This back pack however got daily use and the lap top padding saved my iBook several times. Lots of compartments for me, meant lots of looking for things I forgot where I placed. For adults in a business setting, its appearance still screams high school book pack. Overall a great kitchen sink backpack."
3,Very big bag but no support,"This bag is very big. I can put plenty of stuff into this one bag and go abroad immediately. For me, it's very handy. But when i need to carry it on for a long time, it's not quite good to my shoulder. The shoulder support is not impressive for me."
4,Targus TXL617,The whole first week I used this I found a new compartment every day. Great for all the different things I carry for work.
4,Targus TX617 Notebook Back Pack,Great product for the price. I am in field service and this back pack allows me to carry everything I need to the job site. Highly recommend especially for those out in the field.
5,asome backpack,I got this backpack for my son. He loves it. It is big and has a lot of room to hold all his books and binders. The thing that i like the moste was that it has a place for his laptop. I am satisfide with the price i paid. I though that the backpack was going to be a lot smaller. Then when i opend the packadge i was schoked on how big it is. I may order another one for my other son.
3,Beware: It's enormous!,"I'm sure it's a durable quality backpack. However I disliked how the zippers on the two larger compartments zipped all the way down. If the compartment is slightly/half way open it often completely unzips. Few items have fallen out that way. They should have really called this backpack an XL backpack. For someone who is 6 + feet tall it may be OK. However, if you're just over 5 feet like me... this backpack just looks ridiculous. I simply looked funny walking around campus. Tried it out for one day to see if I could handle it... absolutely not haha.However, it was extremely comfortable for it's size. You truly will be able to fit everything you need in there. Probably 4-5 text books, along with a laptop, lunch and change of clothes. It's like wearing a suitcase on your back. Would be great for traveling and business trips.Before you purchase compare the dimensions with a backpack you already own... would help tremendously. Hope this helps!"
3,Targus is large but lacking in comfort.,I bought this because it is hard to find bags for large laptop/notebook's. Yhis is large and has many pockets and compartments. My laptop fits great. The propblem I have is that although it has a waist strap it has no chest strap. I use this for school and that means I carrry heavy things daily. Although the weight is decreased somewhat by the waist strap the missing chest strap means that the weight in my shoulders can get painful. The price for the bag seems fine for what you get. I hope it holds up.
4,Solid Product,"Large, well thought out backpack. It easily swallows my large 17"" Asus laptop and a ""lot"" of other stuff. It has three large compartments plus a couple small ones and an area to put papers and other loose items in.I had a different model Targus 17"" backpack 6 months ago, and it ripped out some stitching when I overloaded it. These things have a lifetime guarantee, and they replaced it immediately, which is great. Since I travel a lot and need to have a backpack, I ordered this one based on other Amazon recommendations. So far so good."
1,Very disapointed,"I was very disapointed in this back pack. It's extreamly big, the strange place with the two nets is practicaly useless, and even though it appears that the zippers are hidden by a weather gaurd to help protect the computer from the rain, they aren't. All in all i would have liked a different pack."
2,GIGANTIC - much much too big,"I purchased this bag because I needed a bit of a larger bag for my laptop but it was SWIMMING in this bag. Plus, the bag is 150% bigger than the bag I was trying to replace, which means it would not be great to use on an airplane. Lots of pockets/zippers/etc. Probably too many. Seems like great construction but just not logistically great."
2,"Nive product, fell apart within three days, however","The item arrived new with tags, and was in great shape, but without out overloading it, at all, the latch ( I do not know what you call it) broke. I was surprised after only it broke. Unfortunately I do not have the time to return - so I have to live with it."
1,freakishly large,"Ugg, this backpack is freakishly enormous. Maybe it would work on a very large man. As a woman with larger than normal shoulders though, I found this backpack is still as wide as even my shoulders. Looks very odd and stands out in a bad way if worn outside. This backpack is too nerdy for me, and I helped found the Rubics Cubic Association at school..."
3,"To all those with an ASUS, it fits the G75V 17.3in Computer.","Bought this bag in hopes it would fit my ASUS G75V ROG 17.3in Computer. It does, snugly, but still provides protection. The bag itself has a lot of room for the rest of all my stuff. Some flaws though that made me remove some stars. One would be the back flap, held by buckles, could use some elastic netting along the side. I could store more stuff in there without worrying that it would fall out. Another design flaw would be the front buckle that goes around your chest. Its quite low, which isn't really a problem, but if you don't want to use them, they hang low and can be quite annoying. There is no way to round up the loose strap from hanging and hitting my sides/legs.All in all its a great backpack, and a good choice for someone who has a ROG computer, and worried if the extra bulkage of it would make it too big. It fits nice and snugly with no real hassle. Great choice. We'll see how it handles the ""time"" factor."
3,became very wiggly after a while,"Well, the telescoping handles never broke, but they sure became very wiggly after a while and was always in fear of them. One of the zippers became permanently bent so I kept that compartment 75% closes all the time so as not to engage the broken teeth."
3,Likes slightly outweigh dislikes,"Dislikes - Due to the size, storage section dividers are useless. No padding between metal pull bar and interior. I read the dimensions and the online reviews so I thought I was prepared for the size, but it is way bigger than I need for daily back and forth. It's heavier than I anticipated too.Likes - adjustable computer sleeve section. My work laptop and my home laptop are different sizes, so it's nice that the velcro straps can be adjusted. Like the way the handles nest for easier carrying. Even though size is not good for everyday use, as I'd hoped, for overnight trips (back home & business) it will come in handy as there is room to pack clothes/toiletries, so I'm keeping it."
5,Truly AMAZING!,"A lot of people have given this gun a 2 or 1 but thats because they don't read the manual. If you do read it, you'll learn why people's guns are being jamed and you'll learn an easy way to prevent it. This gun is super powerful and very accurate. The only bad thing is that the battery pack is hard to get in, and I still haven't been able to get it out yet. But thats not a problem. You can just leave it in there and charge it. Overall this is a gun that I would pay $200 for but yet its only $120!"
4,Worth It but don't expect alot,I've had this gun for about 4months now it's okay the selector switch wobbles easy fix look online. The gun is sturdy part ABS/Metal the rails are ABS so anything that is heavy on there is likely to tear off. I think this is a good gun its also pretty heavy. It still works great and has a good FPS and Rate of Fire.
1,disappointed so far,"This product has not performed reliably. When firing, it seems that the magazine inconsistently loads a bb. Whether in auto or semi-auto, sSmetimes it fires a bb, more often not. I emailed support@airsoftgames.com on a weekday and received no reply."
1,dont buy,this gun was amazing i bought it for my brother for his birthday and when he got it the clip was broken. i called them up and they said to send it back and i did. they send me the same gun with a different clip and when my brother went air soft the gun stop shooting because the motor for it to be automatic heated up and it won't shot. once the gun cools off it shots again but that sucks no one wants to wait. the company didn't want to do anything about it. don't buy it just go buy a good one at dicks or sports authority
2,"Gun good, but breaks easily","The gun arrived well and worked great for a short time. The mechanism that selects between semi-automatic, and automatic became loose and stopped working. The gun is in semi-automatic mode all the time now. Another problem was the magazine. The magazine is only plastic and stopped working after about a week of use (After the gun was dropped). I'm not sure what a good replacement would be. We contacted the seller and were able to buy another one. This gun is good, but attention to a few other things would have made it great. As is, it has caused me a lot of headaches to keep working."
5,Great Gun!!,"Overall, this is a great gun. The gun has a great rate of fire and shoots pretty fast. It shoots about 340 fps and really packs a punch. It's very accurate to. I can take a target that's about the size of a basketbal and hit it every time at thirdy yards. Yes, the selector switch is loose when you get it. It stays tight enough to work for about 3,000 shots, then it becose too loose. That problem is very easy to fix though. All you have to do is remove the protective screw cover on the selector switch. Then take a screw driver and tighten the screw behind it. With about five minutes of tinkering, you'll have it fixed. GREAT PRODUCT.Pros:-shoots very fast-great rate of fire-very,very accurate for an airsoft gun-great for all agesCons:-with the rate of fire being so fast, uses alot of bb's:)"
3,good while it lasted,good gun it has more than 330 fps for sure has an amazing rate of fire and has great range. buuuuut it broke. i recommend jg guns if your looking to buy an airsoft gun
1,Just my thoughts,Length:: 4:47 MinsMust See. Think its metal ThinkAgain. Much watch. And a 16 Year old's Thought. have been airsofting for 3 years..
2,Great gun for the most part but not good build quality.,"This gun is pretty awesome, high FPS, great accuracy, but the build quality is not amazing. The foregrip is very wobbly and so is the top rail, which is very disappointing if you like to use your own type of sight. A few months after getting the gun I picked it up one day and the whole front mounting area just fell apart. Once I figured out how to put it back together, it did the same thing again a few weeks later. This gun tends to jam often too."
1,swag master,this gun is a piece of crap. it broke in 2 days. i sent it back to fix it and they didnt even fix it. i payed to ship it back and it was a waste and now i am shipping it back so they can replace it. but it was a waste of time and money
1,JG AK47 JG AK Tactical Airsoft Rifle AEG,Don't buy this gun.... It does have some good qualitys WHEN it works.... But it has major shortcomings! (1)the selector switch come apart with very light usage and renders the gun useless.. (they know about this but continue sell it) See the other reviews for its a common problem... (2) the ammo clip has a retaining lever that simply falls out because the retaining pin is loosely slid in.... save you hard earned money for a more reliable brand. these problems occur right out of the box
2,It's Junk Now,Seller has only a 30-day return policy on items that arrive broken. This AK-47 airsoft rifle and NI-CAD battery pack is of very low quality manufacture. Our rifle broke within two weeks of careful use. The motor and battery combination has developed a short that blows the in-line fuse shortly after replacement. It does have a very realistic look but is junk now that the motor shorts out.
1,Gun came broken!,"I would rate it at a minus if I could. The gun came BROKEN, it was sent back in July, with a promise from this company of a refund and that has STILL not happened.I have tried emailing and they are not answering. If this gets no response I will be reporting them."
3,broke after 1 week,"safety switch broke after 1 week, took it to an airsoft store for repair, they fixed it and said the switch failed because of an inferior screw. they fitted it with a higher quality one and now on problems--don't buy airsoft guns on line---go to a store instead!!!!"
3,ok wepon,When i got this gun it was great! i played one war and i owned. Then i hade a 10 hour fight the battery held out but then i started to have problems. The lever for the safe semi and full didnt work. It wouldnt go on safe and it shot auto and semi for like 5 mins then just broke. If i got another one i would get and Echo 1 not this.
3,Dont waste your money,"The accuracy of the gun and the rof of the gun is great. but for me the selector switch broke and now it can only shoot on semi automatic the buttplate that you put in the screws became holowed out and now i can't use that any more.Pros:Good clip,Good rof, good accuracy,Cons: Cheap metal,The top of the gun wobbles,the foregrip wobbles, selector switch gets loose,"
2,GB JG A47 is not sturdy.,"This was a present for my 13 year old son that left him quite disappointed. The item was broken before it was even taken out and fired. The safety lever was loose, and it would not select semi-auto to full auto. Within an hour of use, it would not go to safe either, and only semi auto would work. I removed and replaced the lever hoping to tighten whatever was loose, but with no luck. A day later, and the toy is now inconsistent in any firing mode, and the trigger only works once every few shots.I thought that a full-metal product would be more sturdy and durable than the less expensive plastic toys, but was disappointed in this."
5,very nice,i just ordered this gun im liking the amount it costit worths every penny i spendand another thing i like is the fast processeing i just ordered this gun 2 days ago and it already got processed and is coming tomorrowfrom what i have heard about this gun its a very good one
2,not reliable,"this thing was great when i got it. it could fly for 200-250 feet and totally demolish a can, but now it won't even fire. it started having problems after the 4'th time i used it. the semi has gotten jammed so we fixed it but it still doesn't work! It is very good when it comes to replica's but you can tell something's going to go wrong because it comes with an extra fuse, and is made in china. there is a section that tells you in the manual ""ONLY USE OUR BATTERY.ONLY USE OUR BATTERY CHARGER.IF bb'S ARE REUSED, IT CAN RESULT IN SOMETIMES FATAL DAMAGE TO THE GEARBOX."" so basically, if you reuse a BB like i might have, it basically breaks your gun. i really don't recomend this gun. if you want something fast, non Co2, and cool, look up the TSD TACTICAL G5K AEG, it is an mp5k that is only $90.00. yea, it comes in april and i probably can't even get it because this was my birthday present and it broke.THANKS AMAZON/CHINA FOR RUINING MY 13'TH BIRTHDAY."
1,worst gun,I got this gun being excited as i played with my friends. Package said 350 fps and released it was more like 400. Then a week later it kept getting jammed and the gun cleaner got them out but not well. Then the gun would stop firing for 5 minutes and when i had played my friends I got destroyed. It only shot on semi and then the gun just stopped working. Finally I got to airsplat and they were know help and the gun kept falling apart when I shot. now it is pieces some were in a dumpster. NEVER BUY GUN!!
1,One Time Use,My sons gun arrived today and with in 10 min it was already broke! WHAT A PIECE OF JUNK!! will be returning this ASAP
5,speechless...,"I purchased this gun hoping to find a better one for a reasonable price. Boy did i find it and more! Previously i was thinking i had the best with a cheap wal-mart machine gun, nothing compares to this. Great price, extremely good rifle and for $100.00 what a deal. recommend this to anyone!"
4,Tactical AK,"This is a good gun. I bought it from topdogairsoft. It came with a adjustable front handle. Which is really helpful. Out of the box it got about 380 fps. The battery came semi charged, but charge before use. Nothing was broken. But the box said it had 338 fps. But i shoot my 325 spring at the fence at about 2 feet. It made a small dent. But with this AK at about 20 ft it made a bigger dent. Reasing me too believe that it has more fps than the box says. Overall good gun. Some of the extra things on the outside of the gun are really hard plastic. The Clip was plastic. But it only came with one clip (which I was dissapointed) and no mag clampGOOD GUN!"
3,Great gun. Bad reliability,The shipping here took me 9 days. I live in ohio but still thats a long wait. The gun comes in a nice box brand new not a scratch very nice.But when i was at the 3rd day i had 4 problems.1. Fire selector comes loose after evey time you use it. 2. My fir selector had safe semi and full. but when i switched to semi it was full auto and still is.3. mag broke within 3000 shots. 4.very un deurable. i dropped it on hard wood and the upper reciver wont go on without a fight. But this gun has amazing 415+ fps a better than average rof and looks and feels amazing.
3,CLICKING SOUND HELP!,This gun owed in every battle ive have with it. Now it makes this weird clicking sound everytime I shoot it? Please help!!!!please! if you know how to fix it right a comment. It would be highly appreciated.
3,"Fan Handbook: Selection, Application, and Design","A good addition to other fan design books but incomplete by itself as it lacks any real guidelines on the mechanical design.It should include more on impeller stressing (blade bending & hoop stress), shaft critical speed and impeller resonance.There are a few anomalies but also some good flow information.The axial and centrifugal flow design data is good except for centrifugal fan casings which really only covers wide, high volume designs. If you are looking for detailed centrifugal casing design for high pressure blowers then look elsewhere (I am still looking).The chapter on system resistance is very informative. The other sections on fan applications and the different fan types is also very good.Reviewed by:Richard Knighton - FanMechanics"
2,"If you ever need your sun visors, stay away from this!","I loved the view, you see so much more. But when the sun got in my eyes, and I went to put my sun visor down, no dice! There was no way of positioning the mirror or visor so that they both worked at the same time. Lots of squinty eyes and dangerous sun in your eyes was not worth the extra view in the back (what you need to see in front of you is more important, I concluded)."
5,"Wonderful cast, beautiful soundtrack, I love this drama!","I'm an American who loves watching foreign drama but I was starting to give the habit up since I had a hard time finding one that would capture my interest when I came across this one gem of a story.I fell totally in love with ""You're Beautiful"". The cast was amazing, so much so, that I just couldn't stop watching.To top it off, the soundtrack made me want to run out and learn Korean asap! The melodies were entrancing and beautiful. The talent in this show was absolutely flawless, from the singing to the acting.It was funny, heartwrenching and lovely. I'm buying this item. It's well worth the money and the time."
5,Loved!,"I first saw this when I lived in Hawaii but could never catch all the episodes. I finally found them online! Love this show so much I bought it.JGS is amazing in any role he takes on. Once you start watching you can't stop and it's such a great show you can watch it over and over. Its not about it being believable, its about enjoying what you watch. The characters are so thought out. I mean to go from starting out in a convent, to discovering true love. The show will have you laughing, crying, hoping, and sighing with relief. This show turned me onto so many other dramas and has me purchasing all kinds of shows and movies with Jang Keun Suk! He is so adorable!"
5,This is still my favorite,"This was the first Korean Drama I saw. I watched the Japanese remake of it first because I am learning Japanese. It was pretty good, so out of curiosity I decided to check out the original... I fell in love with it! As many of you may already know K-drama is addictive. I have watched many since. Many times I have thought. ""This drama is so good, maybe this one is my favorite."" But then I go back and re-watch You're Beautiful and quickly realize it has not been surpassed. This remains my favorite drama. Give it a chance. I disagree with the review that said you had to be under 20 to enjoy it. I'm older and once I got past the silly beginning of the show I fell in love with the characters. Every episode they get deeper and better."
5,Movie,I have rated this on already but one of them I got was not as described and I have forgotten whick one it was But the first one I got was a knock off and was of poor quality but as I said I can not remember which place it got it from. The movie is great but be careful when you order them
5,wow,this item came in excellent condition i am very please. this drama was amazing and i enjoyed it a lot.
2,Only For The Young,"Clearly from the reviews, many people like this series. However, if you are over 20, I doubt that it will appeal to you. I only watch episode 1 and parts of 2 and 3. Rather sophmoric. But I can see how it would appeal to young people."
2,Smells good,"Not sure if it works and does what it is supposed to do, but it smells good... I am not convinced of its value for the purpose advertised."
3,nice scent,"I can't attest to it's effectiveness for appetite control but the scent is nice. I just started using it, so the final outcome is TBD."
1,Horribly Ineffective,"Since I'd been having trouble staying awake during the day, and I didn't want to take up coffee drinking on caffeine pills I decided to look into peppermint oil, as I'd recently read that it was supposed to be just as effective when inhaled as caffeine, without the risks.I looked over several products before settling on this one, as it supposedly had other natural scents known to produce alertness.Unfortunately, as soon as I got the product and put it to work I found it completely ineffective. It had no impact on my level of alertness, and I was just as drowsy as ever. I don't know if it's just me, or if the product itself doesn't have the proper concentration, but the product was a complete failure for me."
5,Great overall,"I was looking for an orange marmalade recipe and found several recipes including orange jam and an abundance of other interesting recipes I never knew existed. Bartlett pear marmalade - I even have a recipe now to make jam or marmalade from my tangerines. Apricot Brandy, Coffee liquor also cordials & sherry recipes, even differnt hot fudge sauces and various vinegar recipes! If you are looking for something special to make, I suspect that you will find it in this book! There are also tips and metric and volume conversions."
1,what a disappointment,"I bought two preserving books at the same time- this one and Hilaire Walden's Sensational Preserves. And there was no comparison. Everything I tried from this book was run of the mill. And all those pouches of pectin. The emphasis seemed to be on meeting all the technical requirements to enter your preserves in the county fair---not to put them on the home table. The other book--Sensational Preserves was inventive, beautiful and practical-- and everything we made from it was just as the title said- sensational."
5,A Canning Must,"This was the best canning book ever - clear and easy instructions, lots of different recipes, and most importantly - all so far have been DELISH!! i almost want to order some more copies in case something happens to mine and the book goes out of print, it's that good."
4,Top Canning,I've been going through winter waiting to get to the growing season so I can start in on the canning season. This book has given me lots of ideas and tips to employ this year and has kept me dreaming.
4,Canning Queen,"I competed against the author of this book for many years at the Los Angeles County Fair. She was nearly unbeatable. It's wonderful that she is sharing her knowledge and experience with others. This is a must-have book for novice and experienced canners alike. Thanks, Linda!"
2,So far a big letdown,"After trying 2 recipes in this book (Cherry-Almond Conserve and Strawberry Jam)I have to say that I am not pleased with this book at all. I have made successful jams and jellies all of my life and these are the first 2 times that I was unsuccessful. Neither of the recipes ""set"".I am leery of trying any more of these recipes."
5,Excellent Canning Cookbook,"This is an impressive cookbook with a lot of valuable information for anyone who likes to do home canning. While it does not have glossy color photographs (which would have nearly doubled the price of the book), it is loaded with an amazing amount of practical advice, great canning tips and techniques, and an outstanding collection of recipes for many kinds of preserves. I especially like the author's attention to detail and clarity in the text and instructions.The recipes range from traditional to inventive with lots of creative flavor combinations. I have tried numerous recipes from this book and the colors of the preserves are exquisite and the flavors are sensational. The intense, fresh flavors of the fruits really come through."
4,THE Reference Bible for Making Preserves (with some caveats),"I bought this book based on previous high reviews. I would agree with everything said - this book is a MUST have for the novice or seasoned canner. There are a plethora of wonderful recipes and very detailed directions. However, as a beginner, one thing I feel the book lacks is pictures or diagrams of equipment and procedures. In addition, much of the text and anecdotes seem to be redundant throughout the book. Finally, in my opinion, there is too much emphasis on what should or should be done in order to win a blue ribbon. I found the focus on judging criteria and what may or may not cause a lower score mildly annoying. Although the title of the book promotes secrets to award-winning preserves, in reality, how many people are going to use this book with the sole purpose of entering blue ribbon contests?! All in all, this book is a must have, even with the above caveats."
3,Some good technical info and some questionable recipes,"I am an experienced preserver and have won blue ribbons in our State Fair competitions two years in a row. That said, I like a lot of the info in this book as it pertains to competitions and meeting technical requirements.However, I just finished making a plum jelly recipe from this book and it did not set properly, even though I followed the recipe meticulously. Unfortunately, this is the third recipe that I have made from this book that has not set as I expected. The author prefers and specifies liquid pectin, and as I have not had set issues with recipes from other sources (using powdered pectin or no additional pectin) I suspect that the liquid pectin is the difference.If you are not an experienced preserver or you do not strive to compete with your creations, this book is not for you. Start with the Ball Blue Book (and powdered pectin or no added pectin) and then go from there."
4,"...one of the funniest, most surprising books I've ever read","On her way to sign divorce papers, con artistSamantha Smith meets Jayne Roberts, an archivist for theRonald Reagan Museum. Surprisingly the two could betwins. Sam tries her best to convince Jayne to tradeplaces for a week. That way Jayne can sign the divorcepapers and Sam can take care of trying to get Jayne's""grandnanny"" in a nursing home.Neither imagines the trouble they get into when the planstarts to go awry. Sam's almost ex-husband Russell wantshis first edition Glueman comic book that Sam has stolenfrom him. Sam falls for Ben, Jayne's half-brother, and Benhas feelings for Sam but thinks she's Jayne. Plus someoneis stalking either Jayne or Sam, but for what?This has got to be one of the funniest, most surprisingbooks I've ever read. I've never laughed so hard or so longat the antics of characters. A must read!-Kathy Boswell"
4,all natural and effective,"These work well. It was easy for my baby to drink it up. It's nice knowing it's all natural, and it calms your baby fairly quickly."
5,Nice alternative to acetaminophen,"My daughter seems to actually enjoy having this product. It has helped calm her down, settle her belly ache and ease her into slumber. So much nicer in my mind than sticky artificial acetaminophen based medications for when she not in a ton of pain but just needs the teething edge off and to calm her down. So far it has been a wonderful thing to have around with a teething monster in our home. Love that it's all natural. It ships quickly but not a part of prime but I don't mind paying for it. I actually found the same brand cough syrup a few weeks ago when I had a cough at the local Rite-Aid and it work really well. So I respect this brand very much so far and hope to use other products when needed."
5,Awesome Group!!!!,"This tape make you feel that the only way is up. The Gospel Four is an excellent group. The audience is very lively. I will attend a Gospel Four Concert when I return to the U.S. The money that I spent for this tape was worth it. The Gospel Four are very exspressive in the songs they sing. I love Gospel Quartet music!!! If you do not like Gospel Quartet music. You will like this group. All age groups were praising the Lord on this video tape. Their songs ""Do Good"",""It's Just a Matter of Time"", ""The Only Way Left is Up"" are excellent. This group is very professional."
4,The world's greatest drummer (and the weird guy who hangs out with him),"I have been playing drums for more than 20 years and I have NEVER seen anyone as exciting as Zach Hill! I bought this on a whim because I had loved Hill's drumming on the Mars Volta side project record ""Cryptomnesia"" (a great album by the way). The DVD is so entertaining! It's part documentary of their tour in Japan and the people, places and other bands they meet, part concert movie. The guitar player occasionally does some cool work but mostly just comes across as this very weird guy who makes noises while the world's greatest drummer leaves puddles of sweat (and awesomeness) in his wake!The reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is that the CD is one of the WORST things I've ever listened to. I don't understand how this can be the same band. I wish I could take back the time I spent listening to the CD! The DVD is worth the money I spent and much more though."
1,Simply does not work - AT ALL!~,"I have never used such an impactless (if that is a word) product. There is absolutely no effect whatsoever, not even remotely. It is simply a waste of money and bottle. I am terribly disappointed - you are better off blowing air and water over your ingrown hair areas for better effect.....!"
1,I agree with the guy above,Dont waste your money. This stuff burns try an all natural solution you save your skin
5,Works Very Well,"highly recommend this spray, my husband has notice a dramatic decrease in ingrown hairs since using this product. Combined with lavender oil, and green tea face wash his skin has improved greatly."
2,Not so good,I had to read this book for my book club and we all pretty much said the same thing: not that good!
4,Greek tragedy view of Russian Spy?s ? Suspense +,"Great entertainment - It is fun to run into a book that doesn't insult your intelligence. Anthony Hyde reveals a wonderful mystery, along with giving you a unique evolving view of Russian history. A lucky find, and a great way to spend a rainy weekend reading this book."
1,Not even RBP bats 1.000,This was unreadable for me despite having read about 2/3 of Parker's works and never encountering one that was less than very good. Silly plot. Irritating characters who act stupidly. I will almost always finish a book I start but not this one. I strongly suggest checking it out from a library rather than buying it. Awful.
1,Huge Disappointment,"Let me say that I am a Robert Parker fan and have read every one of the Spenser books. In fact, I picked this book up after having run out of new Spenser books to read. I ought to have just gone back to The Godwulf Manuscript and started over again, because Wilderness is an extremely poor offering from an extremely talented writer. Flat, unappealing characters and a plot that goes absolutely nowhere. Believe me, you're better off with anything else that Parker has written (including the new one, Family Honor). Let this one languish in richly deserved obscurity."
5,loved and remembered,"My son and I read the Parker books. I asked him if he remembered a book written years ago--I could not rememeber the name but remembered the plot. He helped me find the title, Wilderness, and we have ordered the book. We look forward to reading it again. Suspense in woods is excellent!"
5,"Wilderness, A great read","After reading Robert B. Parker's Spencer novels, I was disappointed when I sat down to read Wilderness and found it was not a Spenser novel. This disappointment soon turned into one of the best reading experiences of my life. Writing in third person, Parker was able to do something he never could do with the Spenser character - get us inside the characters minds, letting us know exactly how they felt about everything and move us with their feelings. This is by far the best novel I have ever read and I suggest you get a copy and reserve time to read it all at once. You won't want to put it down"
3,"Okay, but not Spenser","Parker was a spare writer and this novel is no exception. That said, it's not quite up to the quality of his Spenser novels, which I prefer above all others."
1,Yuck!,"Nonstick tubing on metal tines tore at the tip after TWO uses, which drove food particles up into the whisk where they couldn't be cleaned out (unsanitary). Luckily, there's a lifetime warranty, but they replaced it with one of the non-nonstick models (stainless steel only). Is this a sign?As whisks go, this one is decidedly average... best for mixing but not for aerating. Take note: the handles on all of the whisks in this series are _extremely_ heavy (I'd say at least 2 lbs.). It gives you a firm grip, but you definitely need to have a strong hand to use it."
2,Wife reported that her hair began falling out,"My wife reported soon after getting it that her hair began falling out. Unfortunately, this becomes one of those closet stuffers of unfinished products that promised things it didn't deliver on."
5,5-Star Conditionet,"I was skeptical about this product when I'd first read about it. However, after using it, I have become a fan. The conditioner makes your hair feel fuller and silky smooth to the touch. My girlfriend loves to run her fingers through my hair! I'd recommend this conditioner. I will be purchasing this conditioner from here on out."
1,unfit,"this bumper was advertised to fit a 97 dakota,it comes without mounting brackets and does not fit the brackets on the truck-to modify the brackets they must be torch cut approx 2"" and completely redrilled--very unhappy with this product!!"
1,Charged freight for wrong item,"I was charged freight for bumper that was listed as the one that fit my vehicle.I check their limited listing Amazon provided- this is the bumper!When I got the bumper 3"" to short. Did some research found ther are 2 bumpersfor my vehicle. Got the right bumper from Quality Bumper in Phoenix.I find this is a poor way of doing business Amazon.I stuck to your system andI'm the one that got stuck!So long AmazonFrank Hawkridge"
4,Wonderful Resource!,The Streetwise Seville and Andalusia Map was wonderful to use while I was on vacation in Seville. It fit conveniently into either my purse or backpack and it's very sturdy. The only downside to the edition I bought was that it didn't have a full Metro map.
4,A makeshift subsitute for the splashzooka,"The CPS splashzooka is the only true 1-hand gun ever made. And with hasbros stupidity in taking it off the market, us water gun enthusiasts must resort to this. Can block but with not a big enough radius to block a complete attack. I used to use the splashzooka-garbage bin lid combo against opponents and could block more, but still an innovative and effective gun despite its short range."
4,(...) Opinion....oops 6 1/2,This watergun is very strong. My friend Stephen can not defeat me with his tiny pistols because this watergun has a shield. The one part I do not like is the crank; I would prefer one with a pump.
2,"A good shield, but I don't like the crank.","I don't actually own this gun, but a friend does and I have used it. It has a nice shield, so if you use it, you don't have to carry around a garbage can lid for protection. It only shoots about 15 feet and the crank doesn't turn smoothly. I don't know if this is typical of all shield blaster 3000s or if it is a one-time defect. Overall, I prefer the pump and trigger system. I recomend this gun to people who want to defend, but not attack."
1,Is It the 90s or The 70s,"What a disappointment. This was the same book I read in the 70s only smaller, book and print size. I was hoping for something new and exciting."
1,Disappointing,"I thought that turning to a ""standard"" book to spice up the bedroom would be a sure bet, but I was sadly disappointed by this book. The focus was almost solely on male pleasure, with virtually no time spent on the female orgasm. I would be far more likely to reccommend _The Magic of Sex_ by Dr. Miriam Stoppard as a comprehensive sex manual. That which is good in Comfort's book is not unique and that which is unique isn't that great."
1,Great for Misogynists,"This book is awful if you are looking for a book that explains how to have mutually fulfilling sexual experiences. Though its brief discussion of anatomy might be useful for people who've only had high-school sex-ed, the rest of the book focuses on how women can please men, and says almost nothing about what men can do for women. It advocates ""pretend"" rapes and tells women they should have sex whenever their men want them to, even if the women don't. It focuses on the tiniest details of what women can do for men, and says very little about what men can do for women. Even if you're looking for a book on the book on the basics, skip this one- it's biased, uninformative, and sends unhealthy and incorrect messages about women's sexuality."
1,The book is a disappointment for the 90s reader.,"Comfort's book is a disappointment for the 90s reader because it lapses into language and commentary derived from a less sensitive and ""politically correct"" era. In some parts, women's sexual organs are referred to in street-slang terms while male sexual parts are not. In addition, Comfort makes derogatory comments concerning relationships between Middle Eastern males and overweight American women in the back section."
4,It's good for beginners,"I remember needing this book when I was taking a Human Sexuality course. I would recommend this book whether for beginners or for research. Illustrations are helpful to understand various sex positions, very easy reading. There's something in there for everyone."
3,Book review,"The book is fine, I did not know that I was getting a ""compact"" version, which upsets me some."
3,There were stains on this Christmas present..,It was cute with the hat and booties to match. BUT there were stains on the stomach and left leg. But lucky for me I work in retail and know how to put tags back on the item after washing it lol :P She loved it and was none the wiser. So beware I dont know if its the seller or the factor it came from that had something to do with the stains but beware. <3 snoopy
5,A Singular Work - Scholarly and Engaging,"Esterly has created scholarly yet engaging study of the life and work of Gibbons, arguably the greatest and most well known master of the art. Esterly delves into the thought processes behind the work of carving and reveals his intimate knowledge of the subject honestly aquired by countless hours at the carver's bench. Historians, woodworkers and art enthusiasts will be find his account of Gibbon's life and work as complete a treatment of the subject as they could hope to find. While there is much carefully explained technical information concerning the mechanics of carving and creating Gibbon's monumental works it is presented with rare clarity and enthusiasm. Any serious carver should own and study this unparalled work."
4,Tasteless but Tantalizing,"Be warned, a majority of the options offered in this book are truly tasteless, bordering on the disgusting, and sometimes insulting. That said, this is a great idea! (based on the 2003 edition).I have this on my desk, not as a way to track the days, but rather to stimulate conversation in my work area. It never fails to draw attention. Each day, as people stream past my cube, they inevitably stop to ponder the question of the day.For example, today's question was ""Who would you rather have after you? The CIA or the Mafia?"" We make it a game. You can't say ""neither"" you must make a choice and perhaps rationalize it. I recommend this calendar, but with a warning that it is not for the faint-of-heart, nor for a ""delicate"" work environment. :)"
5,Great single release,I love the sound and look of this video. It's one my favourite D&B tracks from way back and it's surprising to see the video is still available for less than retail price.
4,good visual music,"This is a good couple of drum and bass songs with great visual effects. For the price, I definetly recommend this even just as a novelty. If anyone knows how I can get more techno based visual DVD's please e-mail me."
5,Awesome read,I loved this book. Story was great. Everything flowed so good. I loved the characters and the plot was very interesting. Loved it all. Not one bad thing to say about this book is that it ended.
3,Coming Undone,"This book was good and I don't regret buying it however I think this was a little too corny at times and not completely realistic that had you sitting there thinking ""are you serious?""."
4,Worth it!,"Altough it is an impossible story, I liked it. It is fun, sexy and light. The only problem I had was with the very abrupt end. It seems to be written in a rush, and it took away from the fun I had while reading the book. Anyway, for the price of the ebook, it is a good buy."
3,Color is different from the photo.,"The color of the tire is a different color(solid light blue) other than the black color in the photo.I thought the tire had a blue line or stripe on the sidewall only,not the entire tire.The size appears to be smaller than the identified size,more like 20""x1.75 or 20""x1.85 instead of 20""x1.95 which is the size on the actual tires sidewall.The color doesn't really dissapoint me because any color looks good with silver metal flake paint.I'm keeping them."
5,This is a great traveling book!!!!,"This book is a fast paced thrilling mystery. I started reading the Gordian Knot at the start of my plane ride and finished the book before I landed 2.5 hours later.This is a great vacation book. It does not mastter if you are traveling by planes, trains ar automobiles this book will make you trip more enjoyable. I hope her second book is out before my next vacation"
4,Gordian Knot by Joann Fastof,"The ""Gordian Knot"" by Joann Fastoff is a fast-paced story, and an easy read with a terrific main character. The story reminded me of Tom Clancy and Robert Ludlem novels because of the intrigue at high levels of the US government. The main character, Mark Mason, brought to mind the spunky main characters in John Grisham's ""The Client"" and the title character in ""Bud, Not Buddy"". All three boys were clever, self-sufficient and suspicious enough to keep themselves safe and moving forward on their journeys. I also appreciated the ties between VietNam, the Iranian hostage crisis, and present day FBI.I really enjoyed this book, and would recommend it to anyone that wants to devote an afternoon to fun escapism."
5,Hard to find,use product as soon as it arrived straight out of the package.. Work without any problemb..Easy to earase mistake not like dvd where you can't edit.. The round cartridges fits into camera and love the fact that it is double sided so that you don't have to change the dvd when it ends just flip and continue..You get 60min of recording on a disc.. Brought 2 and have no regrets..easy to transfer just like an SD..
2,They will crackle like hell,"Every month I have to buy a new pair of these because they end up crackling and melting from the inside. I've opened them up, and the small wires lose their glue. The sound will nearly give out to make it sound like those apple earbuds. I think I've gone through four or five since January. I have to keep the others lying around as backup for when the new one will break and I have to wait for the new pair to ship. Great if you will only listen with them once a week. The only reason I keep buying them is that the bass is really pronounced and I don't have time to search for new ones."
2,Uncomfortable!,"I've never had problems with using earbuds before, but these are significantly larger than Apple or Sony earbuds and they are super uncomfortable. Tried wearing them once and won't use again"
3,Exactly what you would expect for the price,"I decided to give these headphones a try after reading all of the positive reviews, but the cynic in me knew there was no way that headphones this cheap were going to be any good.Unfortunately, I was right. They sound ""okay"" at low volume, so they might work for someone who wanted to listen to quiet music while studying or sitting on a plane. But I listen to my headphones while I cut grass or run a tractor, so I tend to listen to my music loud. After you turn the volume above 40%, these headphones stop getting louder and just start getting more distorted. At 60% volume, music doesn't even sound like music anymore. These sound so bad that I chose to use the headphones that originally came with my ipod (which I also think sound pretty bad, just not as bad as these headphones do).You get what you pay for."
2,Too big,I should have known better than to buy this type of earphone. They are too big for my ears and my husband's ears too. I can't rate the sound because they don't fit.
3,Alright for some people.,"This was my first pair of earbuds, and while they sound okay, wearing them for longer than 30 minutes hurts my ears. They feel way too big. Probably my own fault. I'd suggest you look elsewhere if you have big earholes like me."
2,Meh.,"These earbuds are okay. They get the general task done of letting you listen to your music. You definitely get what you pay for. The sounds is 'meh' - by that I mean the sound is nothing special - sufficient enough. However, my problem with these buds is they hurt my ears! I can't stand to wear them for longer than one or two songs. I guess the ear part is too big, maybe? Or just the fact that it is not cushioned could be why they hurt my ears. Wouldn't recommend these earbuds to anyone."
4,highly recomend,"very pleased with these headfones. i use them everyday in the gym for an hour at a time and they hold up very well. i had to put some foam bud covers on them so they will stay in my ears when i start to sweat. the bass is great considering the price i paid for them, actually i would expect to pay more for the quality of these. i give 4 stars instead of 5 due to the fact they didnt come with bud covers and i had to buy some. i highly recomend these in fact when it is time for me to get another pair i will reorder these."
5,Awesome!,"Love them, good quality! Fits the ear well, looks nice, color choices, all around would recommend them for adults or children."
4,Good headphones,"They're obviously not super high quality, but I've had them for a few months now and they haven't broken yet."
5,good item,"I still use it, the quality is fine, for me. if you really pursuit some high quality you better fine others. Anyway, it is good price, good item, and you can have one or more than one. If you lost it, at least you won't feel hurt that much, just joke."
1,Don't Stay In Ears:-(,"Could just be my ears, but these ear bugs are not designed well at all. They are big, bulky, and do not rest in my ears comfortably as I expected. I will be buying another set of ear bugs to replace these:-("
4,"Very cheap, but......","This is a cheap panasonic product, but it is fine. The sound quality is acceptable but the around of your ear will feel aches when you wear it for a long time."
2,Not at all like iPod earbuds,"I was hoping to get a replacement for the basic iPod earbuds. It's hard to tell from the picture, but these do not look at all like the basic earbuds--they have a weird, bulky design. They're also really uncomfortable to wear for extended periods of time. I wound up getting the JVC HA-F140-W earbuds as a replacement for these almost immediately and found them much closer to the original."
4,Great,I was buying this for my friend for christmas. its actually darker than the picture shows. its like a darker teal but its still a nice color. it came within the day said but it was the last day so this isnt something to buy last minute for someones birthday next week. The packaging was nice. there was a lil chip off the lid of the box but nothing was tampered and that happens. Overall very good
2,worn once then into the drawer,"I wasn't impressed with the sound-tinny high-end, little bass. The earbuds were not that stable in the ears. I compared them with my iPod earbuds and with my heavier, noise-cancelling earphones while listening to the Who's Baba O'Riley. I heard little bass with these earbuds, so I went right out and bought a pair of skullcandy INK'D earbuds which I wear now when I don't want to carry the JVC noise-cancelling earphones."
3,"nicely designed, comfortable in your ears, yet, inferior sound to Sony","The design is nice and it doesn't hurt my ears for 10+ hr flight.The issue I am having is the sound quality is not as good as Sony MDR-E818LP Fontopia, which slips away from my ear sometimes, but blocks the noise on the plane efficiently and delivers a way better sound, especially the base sound to almost highest expectation, I even thought the tiny earbud was better than noise-control headphones of $100-200 that I have had,chunky, heavy, and sweat-inducing.But, this Panasonic one is just a nicer design without the same good sound. Yet, it sits nicely in your ears. That matters to some people like me for sure."
3,imbalanced volumes,"The earphones overpower certain melodic aspects of songs, creating a unbearable, pointed sound when I'm listening to songs in a loud backgound noise kind of setting (in a car on the highway). I have to use the ""small speakers"" equalizer on the ipod to avoid damaging my ears. This effect is tolerable in quiet places with a soft volume. Also, the earphones have almost no bass without changing EQ settings."
2,wish i had read big buds before i kinda wasted our money!,Tho the sound on earbuds is prob 5* ...The earbuds are just way TOO BIG so why a 2*...so be warned if you or the person you are buying for have smaller/normal ears not for you/them and look else where ..can only wear for short time and then really hurt the ears..shame really.
2,I'm with the guy who doesn't like them,"Forget chewing or walking, they just don't stay in. They are good for if you are laying totally still reading, but try not to yawn."
5,I really like these,I have quite a few inexpensive earphones and these are my surprise favorite. I like the way they stay in my ear with comfort. I like how they sound good including good bass. I like how they don't come apart as so many do. I like how they are relatively easy to untangle.
3,Not as good as Panasonic RP-HV152,"I've been a long time user of the Panasonic RP-HV152, which after trying many earbuds seemed to be the best. This new model has stickier plastic, and more convex shape, causing more tangles of the wires. These are also bulkier than necessary."
2,VERY UNCOMFORTABLE,"When I purchased this ear-buds, I wanted something comfortable to wear for long periods of times. they are SUPER uncomfortable, in fact wearing them for long periods of time eventually causes my ear (specifically the ""concha"" area).It produces/gives good audio (nothing amazing or life-altering. I own theSony MDRE9LP/PNK Earbud Headphonesand they happen to be very comfortable to wear for longer periods of time.I do enjoy the clip which allows me to wear them on the back of my neck when not in use."
2,Not worth it,Exactly what you would expect from $6 headphones. Lasted about a week of normal usage before one began cutting out.
3,Hard to put into ears,"The sound quality if OK. But the only problem is that it's hard to put the earphone into my ears... It's a little bigger than the normal size I guess. If you sit in front of your desk it's okay to use it but if you move, you'd better not choose this one..."
3,Meh,"I bought them because they were cheap. They are a very good quality and work very well but the ear buds are too big and dont my ears. Ladies, its not really a good fit."
2,Not good,"I ordered these with Sony MDR-E818LP and was blown away by the difference between them, the sound quality on these doesn't even compare to that of the Sony, do not recommend. Spend about $2 more for the Sony and you won't regret it."
3,"Very loose wire, not recommended",The sound quality is just OK for the price. The wire is too loose it is always tangled and very inconvenient when you want to pick the earphone up from the bottom of your bag. I do not recommend this to anyone.
3,Not worth it,"These earbuds are not very comfortable for me for some reason. They don't seem like they should fit any differently compared to typical Apple earbuds, but yet I hate the feeling these earbuds give me when I wear them. The sound quality is on the bad side of average. Don't bother with these."
3,Pretty good,"These earphones are slightly uncomfortable but it's probably because i have small ears. The sound isn't as clear as i would have hoped for but because i am used to the apple earphones. However, they are totally worth the price i paid."
2,Not for runners,"Maybe my ears are too large but the buds keep falling out of them when I run. It's a great price, but I wouldn't recommend these buds if you do a lot of running/jogging."
5,Works great!,"These headphones perform like a much more expensive pair, even though they are priced very low. I have several pairs (home, work, kids) and we use them all the time. They compare favorably to the pair that came with my iPhone, but cost mere pocket change in comparison. Love it!"
2,Poor quality,"poor quality, volume doesn't go very high and sound is awful. the color is not red but pink and the wire is weak."
4,Panasonic RP-HV21-K Earbud Review,"The Panasonic RP-HV21-K Earbuds are really good earbuds at a good price. They are of the ""iphone"" sit in the ear design. But that is where the similiarity ends. The sound quality is first rate and the bass is outstanding. I put them in my ears and am immediately immersed in sound. They have a unique clip design that allows you the link the two earbuds together. Why is this important? Because the earbuds cables will tangle almost immediatly after the earbuds are coiled for storage. I have spent two minutes untangling the earbuds cables from the main cable when the earebuds are not interlocked. Even with this tangling issue I still think the earbuds are first rate."
5,awesome sound,sound great. the bass will blow you away. very comfortable. I have been using for five months with no problems. Cord is very soft and pliable.
3,"Meh, a decent pair of headphones that don't rape my earholes.","Got these for the office, they're okay. The design isn't great, it looks like it's from the 90's with that big plug part and two visible wires when they're joined together. It works okay for most things, nice strong sound, but when the bass hits, mine sort of start rattling so it's pretty much impossible to listen to songs with a LOT of bass. And it was a black eyed peas song that caused this issue today, so I wasn't sad at all to skip it, all other songs worked fine."
4,Great little earbuds but....,"I bought these earbuds along with some Sony MDR-PQ5 earbuds just to keep a pair at work because I use them a lot and I mostly keep them in my drawer. After I compared them, I noticed that the Panasonic earbuds deliver more bass than Sony but... the highs seem to be dominant and it could be uncomfortable for some people. For the price, they are good with very good sound quality (not the best) and cheap."
2,"Too big, won't stay in.","Great sound but does not stay in ears. I put on the ear bud covers from my iPhone earbuds, which helps but it still falls out when I run with the earphones on. I got 3 pairs of these, 2 for my kids, but they are certainly too big for their ears too."
4,Worth more than the price.,"These headphones sound great. They are loud and clear, with no static at all. They are a bit uncomfortable for me, but I can deal with it."
3,"Cheap Headphones, Cheap Performance","I mean...they work. They do play music and they're dirt cheap. But they're too big for my ears, uncomfortable, and very very tinny."
4,"Good Purchase, Considering Price","Works, great. Came fast in the mail. The sound quality wasn't as good as my previous headphones (gumy) but its still good overall. Clips come in handy a lot for me especially as I ride my bike a lot."
2,Costs more than other headphones and are even worse than those,"These headphones are garbage. The design will hurt your ears because they are big and don't fit in your ear at all! The sound is just absolute garbage from loudness to just overal sound quality.I can't say much about durability, but scrap these pieces of garbage and just buy a pair of apple headphones if you must go cheap(they actually cost less than parasonic)If you're an audiophile with a low budget buy sennheiser... or get skullcandies... (slightly cheaper than sennheiser)"
4,Good for the price,"Solid set of headphones. They fit comfortably in the ear. The audio quality is decent, but better than i expected. Given the price. I'm happy with the purchase."
4,Good headphones for the price,"Panasonic usually has good headphones! These are pretty good as well for normal use, to listen to audio. I have had these for about a year so far, and the sound quality is nice!I would recommend you to get these if:-you want headphones just to listen to audio, with NO mic input-you want to spice up your choices with the various juicy colors that are available-you don't really care about the bass quality of the audio"
2,You get what you pay for,"These were awful. They didn't stay in my ears and the clips were very weird. I thought by ""clip"" they meant an actual clasp on the cord so you could clip them safely to your clothes. Not so. If you look closely at the product picture you can see the gap behind the ear buds where the plastic pulls back to create a weak clip. Not what I was expecting."
3,Its ok,I think that the buds are way too bid and uncomfortable and although its tangle free feature is truthful I'm still not that satisfied with it.
2,Loved them while they lasted,"Maybe I am just hard on headphones, but I really expected them to last a little longer. After about a month of regular use, one ear went silent, then the other.... I guess you get what you pay for. The sound was great ant they were really comfortable while they lasted..."
2,"Low price, but not much is good about these","I bought these for a trip where I didn't want to risk damaging my nice headphones so I was looking for something pretty cheap that I wouldn't care about beating up. When I took them out of the package, they felt exactly how i thought they would; cheap design and a flimsy cord. When I hooked them up to my computer, I went through a variety of music with high trebles, smooth mids, and deep bass. The treble and bass are WAY out of balance. Sometimes the treble is almost too shrill and soft bass doesn't even register. If you are used to Sennheiser or Audio Technica like I am, these are not for you.So in summary, great as a pair of headphones to beat up but if you want even a little bit of sound quality, get something else.Pros:Low priceFairly comfortableCons:HORRIBLE sound qualityFlimsy cordUgly design"
4,Nothing special but completely worth the $5-$6.,There is nothing wrong with them and they work as expected. I like that the individual ear buds have the built in clips so you can clip them together as it's own lariat or individually to a collar. The buds are a tad big making them just a tad uncomfortable and I'd say my ears are average.Average = 3/5average sound = 0Neat clip engineered into the individual bud = +1seemingly a half size to large for average ears = -1Great price = +14/5
3,Simple headphones,"I've just received these and my first comment is that the color is GRAY not black. The sound isn't particularly crispier or even worse than other headphones. They don't fit tight at all in my smaller-than-average ears, I don't think they'll hurt - if anything they'll tend to fall easily."
2,Uncomfortable and too big,"I've had many pairs of earbuds, and these are terrible. They don't fit in my ear at all (I've never had this problem with any other headphones). The sound quality is ok, but they just don't fit."
2,not violet but deep purple,The ear buds are a super deep purple color.. and have an echo... and stick out farther than any other ear buds I've had
3,Decent,"The headphone are nice. The bass sucks though , there not as loud as I excepted , but I like them. I think the built in clip is pointless because it on the bud of the headphones."
3,kat,good for the price but not the most comfortable buds. do not keep out other noise well. too big and hard. sound was fine. if you want decent sound for cheap not bad. colors are nice.
4,GXR,Good ear phones for the price. Little lacking on the bass response. Slightly uncomfortable if worn for long periods of time. Cord gets tangled easily
5,great sound,having tryed several headphones i have found these by far the bestgreat sound retaines volume over timebuilt in clip handy when on the gowould and have recomended
5,"Stick out a bit, but are great regardless.","For the price, these Panasonic earbuds are a great buy. They are simple, cheap, and sound better than most other earbuds I have used. They are a bit wider than other earbuds (they stick out maybe one or two more centimeters than most other earbuds), but I think the larger width helps to make the sound more ""surround."" Even with the slight protrusion, they are a great choice if you are looking for earbuds which are cheap, and sound great for the price."
1,Terrible,these are not terrible for the audio quality but because of the shape. these have to be the weirdest and biggest shaped ear buds. they would not fit in my ear at all. to big and uncomfortable. it hurt a lot
3,Rashon,"My headphones was working the way I did need them to but they broke a day later. I was to work up about them at first. But for great sound,they worked Okay!"
4,Very Nice!!,They sound great!! I purchased them for an upcoming overseas trip but I find that I am using them almost daily. Great sound!!
4,JVC HEADPHONES,"THESE ARE REALLY NICE HEADPHONES. BUT THEY DON'T REALLY GO THAT LOUD, VERY LOOSELY FITTING,AND THE CORD IS WAY TOO LONG BUT OTHER THAN THAT THERE OKAY."
2,Well....,"...these headphones did not last longer than expected. After only 2 months of use, they shorted out. From what I can recall, the sound was decent, but the audio wire was thin. I expected better since they are a brand name, but didn't expect studio quality since they were so cheap...you get what you pay for, I guess."
3,"Decent sound, cheap build.","The sound quality is decent enough and they are very light weight. The build quality is extremly cheap. The chord is 9ft long but it is too thin. The piece that goes over the head is so thin it feels like it will break under it's own weight. The volume control on the chord works well. It says ""superbass"", but Trick Daddy's Let's Go! and Cypress Hill's Superstar sounds like all treble and mids to me. Acceptable for the price, but they definately won't be found in a sound studio..ever."
2,"No bass, or highs",Not impressed at all. sound quality is junk. I have to turn my ipod up full blast just to hear it at the same level as half way with other head phones. No highs NO lows just murky mid blah.. My cheep Koss set sounds a million times better.. very upset about my purchase.
2,Plug-in connection to computer is wobbly,"I quite enjoy the sound quality of these headphones. However, I bought them specifically to watch Netflix while I am on my rowing machine. The length is great, but the plug-in connection is loose and wobbly and I have to ""play"" with the plugin until it seems to work consistently. The plug-in does not seem to be tight enough, not a good fit. Not sure if I am adequately describing the problem, but it's annoying. I would like to have been able to communicate with the seller, but there are no options other than to return the headphones. If the seller reads this, I wouldn't mind any suggestion he/she might have to correct the problem. Otherwise, the headphones are perfect. If I cannot hear the audio, though, what good are they? Please advise."
5,Awesome sound,"Product works as ordered. Perfect sound and outside noise is virtually eliminated, as evidenced by my having to tap my teenage son on the shoulder to get his attention when he's using them. Well, he is a teenager."
4,Great for the price,I bought these headphones because they are inexpensive and do not need batteries like the cordless ones do. They are being used by a family member who is hard of hearing and can now enjoy watching TV everyone. I plug the headphone into the receiver that is connected to the TV surround sound. This allows her to listen to the TV through the receiver and adjust her own personal volume control while everyone watches the TV with the volume at a normal level. Everyone is happy. For this reason I am not critiquing the sound quality although for the price it is good. They are just $13 so I would not really expect them to be of superior sound quality for listening to music but for the purpose I am using them for they work.An added bonus is that they come with a larger plug adapter that comes in handy for plugging into a receiver and/or a smaller device.Great value for the price.
2,good sound POOR stability,"the sound on this headset is very good, however it will not hold very well at all, the fit is very loose and I have normal adult head size."
2,good and bad,"ok for a video game I guess but, if you want something you can rock tp spend some more money. There plastic not anodized aluminum. and there very light which is good in a way but, they need more weight in the magnets. Just not enough uumph for me."
4,great for the price,"Fits really nice and very comfortable. Sound is great, love the extra bass boost. The only flaw I have with it is it seemed like the cord was 6-8 feet long! My goodness, what am I going to do with all that extra cord? Make a sweater?!"
1,"This item is taking an entire eternity to arrive, shame on you guys...","This item has no info track, is taking the longest to be shipped to, I'm needing this items or otherwise I wouldn't had ordered them in the first place, I hope one day it will arrived to me. Awful service."
2,Not loud enough and don't stay on,"I was not pleased with these headphones. They feel cheap and aren't loud at all. Full volume on my phone and the headphones only results in an average, quiet listening volume. They don't sit comfortably on my head either. Sending them back."
5,perfect for montessori pouring practice!,i got this for my 18 month old son to practice pouring. it's EXACTLY the right size. it's pretty so he is drawn to it and wants to use it. it's heavy enough so that we he slams it down on the counter it doesn't break but light enough so he can pick it up. perfect. exactly what i was looking for.
3,So-So,"I didn't find Kline as addictive as I did Burroughs. I couldn't put the John Carter books down until I had read the last page. Kline was a little more tedious. The book combines the female characters of ERB's Barsoom books with villains from his Moon Maid. He even uses the same bisyllabic, vaguely-Chinese names that Burroughs favored. Kline's Kamud is identical to ERB's Kazars. But Thorne is a lot more one-dimensional and less compelling than Carter; he doesn't go through any of the adjustments Carter did, such as learning the language, culture shock, or the comedic gravity adjustments. And the juvenile editing was annoying. The publisher obviously used a computer to spellcheck. There were several times when a word was spelled correctly, but was clearly the WRONG word, such as the ""truck of a tree"" (an actual example). For a paperback of this price, I would think they could have exercised much more care."
3,Jhaeman's Review,"Otis Adelbert Kline's The Swordsman of Mars shares most of the common features of the ""sword and planet"" genre started by Edgar Rice Burroughs: an Earth-man suddenly transported to a Mars which has a mix of technology both ancient and futuristic; the Earth-man becomes involved in local intrigue and survives all manner of swashbuckling adventure through his quick wit and sharp swordplay; a beautiful native Mars maiden falls madly in love with him; and the hero realizes that Mars, and the life of adventure it promises, is far superior to his hum-drum life on Earth. However, Kline's writing is engaging, has some nice twists, and the story moves along quickly. There's a certain freshness and energy to The Swordsman of Mars that seemed lacking from Michael Moorcock's more jaded pastiches. Kline unfortunately died in middle-aged and so his production was cut short, but I'm looking forward to reading his other entry in the Planet Stories line, The Outlaws of Mars."
3,Decent Psuedo-Burroughs,"State of the art planetary adventure, circa 1933. Earthman Harry Thorne finds himself implausibly transported to Mars, where he becomes embroiled in the usual palace intrigues, swordfights, encounters with strange and dangerous flora and fauna, imprisonments and escapes, etc. and in the end finds himself ruling pretty much the whole darn planet. Kline (who was one of the original editors of Weird Tales magazine in the 20's and was also Robert E. Howard's literary agent) was considered the only real rival to Edgar Rice Burroughs. He wasn't quite the exotic world-inventor that Burroughs was (Kline's Mars is a trifle pale next to ERB's), but he had some strengths of his own - he didn't rely on coincidence as much as Burroughs did, and his female characters are more competent and independent than Burroughs' ever were, which was a pleasant surprise. Good clean fun. (With violence - that's the best kind!)"
3,EZ Table,"Item exactly as described. I would buy from this seller again.Great idea and handy.I wish the table part was a little studier. Not strong enough for my HP TouchSmart 610, but OK for laptops, mouse, keyboards and meals.The magazine holder on the base should be easily removable. It makes it harder to position the table where needed and is useless. Almost everyone has gone digital. Especially us old folks who need to control font size and can't use our hands as well as the old days."
1,Wrong Picture,ummmmm....pretty sure that's not a 3 piece bistro set pictured above...no...pretty sure that's a brake rotor...would be a very expensive rotor too...
3,being the only book isn't a Good Thing,"a quick rundown of what I needed to do:We have RSA fobs that have an algorithmically changing number displayed on them. Logging into a remote machine requires that we check the fobs readout for the current number. Needless to say, it's not possible to automate this part, but all of the other parts are automatable. It took me a long time to find how to ""exit out of the automation, and jump back into it"", and this is likely one of the more useful features of expect.As others have said, the structure of this book is not very predictable, and the parts that you wish would be more detailed, are the ones that lack the most info (the actual expect script command, and it's branching structure is only discussed to ""one level deep"").In general, you use expect to kludge together apps...so in a sense, expect has grown to be somewhat of a kludge in and of itself. It's a necessity in the UNIX world, but don't expect to master it fully for a long time."
3,review,"book is the same I expected and in good condition as mentioned, but the shipment was too slow but in time on max side :).."
2,Anticipate a long and painful reading session,"I bought the book because I needed to create a script with Expect quickly, and nothing on the web really took me step-by-step through what I needed to do. Well, the book is disorganized and anything but to-the-point. I ended up spending a lot of time extracting the essentials, and I had to go on the web for supplementary material anyway! But, as others have noted, there's not much else out there."
2,No other choice,"If you are a beginner and you survived using this book, consider it as an accomplishment. This book is quite difficult to understand, it takes a lot of testing. Even a short example cannot quite explained by the author properly. The way the author explains something he thinks that all the audience are like John Ousterhout.This book gave me a headache browsing back and forth looking for some answers. However, I will give Don Libes a 2* because of the effort. Too bad there is really no alternative out there. Once I learned Expect from trial and errors and more headaches I can probably write a better one."
3,Its time for Expect Cookbook,"Expect is a life saver in our unix environment and Don Libes has done a great service to the sysadmins of the world by developing this tool. If I could rate expect, it would get five stars and Libes would get a metal for making my job easier. However, for the book, three stars for poor organization (and everything else previously mentioned by a frustrated reviewer from Boston). I get so frustrated paging back and forth in the book, holding the index with one finger, trying to find the little code snippits I need to do the job. The book starts off well enough and there are wonderful techniques which I have been able to adopt, but as the book proceeds, and the examples get more complex, the explanations wane. How 'bout it, you exepect experts, is anyone out there willing to develop the ""Expect Cookbook""?"
2,"Reads like a seedy novel, no organization, helpless index.","I've come to ""expect"" computer books to deliver information in succint form, followed by useful examples. Instead, this book reads like a novel. The only way to understand anything is to read from start to finish. And without a companion TCL reference it's hopeless. Many keywords are used and discussed in passing, but never defined.The index randomly references word matches within paragraphs instead of topical sections. (Someone must have used a blind ""find"" function since the index was obviously an afterthought.)A language with such a narrow purpose and small command set shouldn't require nearly 600 conversational pages. I admit I didn't give this book much of a chance, but as my only available reference to this subject, I am very frustrated. I loved the O'Reilly Perl book. How could they have strayed so badly with this one?"
4,A Good Solution to a Tough Problem,"I used Expect to interface security code, which could not be altered in any way, to GUI's and did it with scripts of less than 30 lines of Expect script for each comand. Expect allowed me to idiot-proof my code by generating diagnostic GUI's for each type of erroneous input. The book should be read from cover to cover because each succeeding topic depends on learning the one before it. Timeouts are a very important topic and the use of ""exp_continue"" and ""set timeout nn"" to control them. I wish the author had told me earlier about ""exp_internal 1"" to activate Expect diagnostics. Without this command, you are flying blind while debugging your Expect script."
4,"Sturdy, pretty light and fairly bright","These are nice, quite sturdy lights that can be used as pathlights or to hang. The glass has a ""cracked"" style pattern that throws off a pretty patchwork of light. That they are glass makes them feel more sturdy, but makes them more of a hazard for high-traffic areas where they might get bumped or to take camping. They're quite bright compared to other solar lights."
2,Pretty but don't really work!,"I placed these lights on my porch, on the north side of my house, in wintertime. Even on the brightest, sunniest day, they don't get enough sunlight (due to the low angle of the sun in winter)to light them for more than 30 minutes at dusk. I can't imagine them staying lit for ten hours. Very disappointing. They should not have to be placed in full direct sunlight all day every day in order to light for longer than a few minutes.It gets dark around 4:30pm here in winter - by the time I get home at 6:30 (and really need the lights!) they have already shut off.Attractive to look at but almost completely non-functional for the purpose I bought them to fulfill."
1,Looks Nice but dosen't Last,"I bought 4 of these Malibu Lanterns, 1 died, doesn't light even with new battery, another one doesn't recharge anymore and I have to put the battery in a house recharger to keep it lit. The other 2 are hanging-in. They lasted about as long as the warranty lasted, but still look nice in the sun light. Too bad because I don't think they will ever rust and continue to look new after 2 years of being exposed to all types of weather. Poor quality eletronics I suppose."
4,"malibu outdoor ,one light solar powered metal lanterns","The reviews I read mentioned the short time these lanterns stay on at night, well in the northeast we don't have much daytime uv in the fall and winter, so they preformed as expected, on for a couple of hours at dusk. I expect that next spring and summer they will be on for most of the night. What I didn't expect and was pleased about it, was the beautiful light pattern that the glass cover produces on my deck. Over all with the understanding that these lamps are basically spring summer outdoor lamps, I'm pleased with the purchase and they are well worth the money I paid for them."
5,The force is strong with this one,Exceeded my expectations. Arrived weeks before promised. Quality of disc was almost new. Recently watched it with my son. Better than the series.
5,Awesome bridge,These short stories don't leave a lot of room for character development but they show where characters are headed and have some really awesome action. They show how the characters work within war context and give the Jedi some awesome tasks. Worth a buy for any Star Wars fan. I couldn't believe it ended so quickly and am eagerly awaiting the second volume!
3,Meh,"Don't get me wrong, I love Star Wars. Even the prequel trilogy, whilst a vast disappointment on many fronts, at least had enjoyable action sequences. But I found little enjoyment in these animated episodelets, whose voice acting was terrible, whose action sequences were sometimes fun but more times groaningly unrealistic (a mile-wide floating hammer for ground warfare? Robots and clones on speeders with honest-to-god lances??), whose character development was (understandably) nonexistent, and whose sheer clunky animatedness was jarring for someone used to the photorealism with which the Star Wars universe is more usually presented. 'Clone Wars' is geared toward the eight-year-old -- and, I admit, effectively so -- and, indeed, my inner eight-year-old was the only part of me that came away pleased.Sixty-nine minutes is too short to spend fifteen dollars on, in my opinion. Get it on the cheap, if you can."
4,Intense Cartoon!,"When I first saw the Clone Wars cartoon on tv I knew I needed the DVD when it came out. I love the action sequences and think they did an excellent job. A few things seem a little far-fetched, but it's a cartoon so I let them pass."
4,Great shorts spanning the period between 2 and 3,"I didn't really expect much of this DVD until I found out that it is really planned by Lucasfilm to be a storyline between episoded II and III. There are 20 very short films (3-4 minutes). There is a lot of action, intruduction of new characters and adventures of the Jedi in the Clone Wars. We see Anakan grow bolder and more rebellious, see the role of Dooku and General Grevious and the further battles.The animation is very simple but very good, you really can see the faces of the actors so you know immediately who you are dealing with. That is easy because there is not a lot of explenation, some of the shorts barely have speech, some none at all.If you are a Star Wars fan definitely get this. If you are new to the Star Wars saga and didn't think episodes 1 and 2 were very good (don't worry, many Star Wars fans agree) you might like this one."
4,Visually appealing,"I did not really watch the series on Cartoon Network, but I it interested me quite a bit. So, when I watched this DVD, I knew I missed a lot! And although the shorts are, well, short, and sometimes confusing, I couldn't help but be amazed by it all. The bridge that carries Episode 2: Clone Wars and Episode 3: Revenge of the Sith is masterfully animated and well told. The animation had a manga taste to it, but had classic American animation in it as well. The cartoon was also fast and very stylized, which happens to be a real good thing in this case. And the story, less we forget, was absolutely wonderful. But, as great as the animation and story line were, the extras on the DVD were exceptional. Those features went behind the scenes of the animation and story-telling process. Great moments and fantastic stories.Great and highly recommended. Visually addictive, and even when no words are spoken the story is as intriguing as ever. 4.5 stars out of 5."
2,Rent it!,"After watching the SITH I was excited about seeing this DVD as it promises to bridge Ep II and III. I was very disappointed with it as it didn't do that. I would not see this unless you are a Star Wars fanatic and even then I wouldn't spend money buying it.. rent it at your local video store..I would recommned reading ""Labyrinth of Evil"" by James Luceno which ties in Ep II and Ep III very nicely."
1,Not Good,"I enjoyed all the Star Wars films, but this cartoon is all over the place. Too much action that becomes boring very quickly and no story or character development. Volume two is not that much better, but it does have General Grevious as well as another wannabe sith character that's good, but can't really enjoy since it's so fast."
2,Disappointing,"I realize that there wasn't much possibility for a plot to be established in the 3 minute clips of the ""micro series,"" but I thought that there wasn't much more than some frenetic battle scenes, a few lines of dialogue thrown in, and characters running (or flying) all over the screen.The art and animation were superb, but at the end of the series, I wanted the real thing as only George Lucas and company can deliver. I certainly won't buy this on DVD after seeing it for free on Cartoon Network. Also, I can't beleive that this series won an Emmy.Bottom line for me: May 19th, 2005 is worth waiting for to see Revenge of the Sith. Accept no substitutes."
2,Better than the prequels? Are you on Crack?,"How can 20, five minute cartoons that consist of no plot, no story arc, no character development, and nothing but mindless action be better than Episodes I or II? This is just an inflammatory remark that has absolutely no merit whatsoever. Stop hating and even more important stop over praising this interesting but ultimately shallow ""micro series."" Its a lame attempt at trying to emulate the Animatrix and it fails quite miserably."
2,Who Cares?,"Lucas has wrung the last drop of blood from Star Wars. The last trilogy was a mistake, an artistic disapointment, and a failure to maintain continuity.This series was an effort to bridge the gap- to maintain continuity- but by that point no one really cared anymore other than diehard fanboys of whom I used to rank with.Save your money. Save yourself. There's really no point in purchasing this series, unless you want to finance Lucas's kids after his death."
2,"All right, but hardly great","I don't understand all the 5 star reviews that this received, especially those saying that it is ""worthy of the originals"", as this, in my opinion, suffers from the same thing that the ""Phantom Menace"" suffered from, and that is being too childish.I also did not care for the animation (not the style I'd have chosen for Star Wars), but that I could have lived with it if the story itself was more mature. I could not help but feel, however, like I was watching an episode of the Super Friends instead of a Star Wars show."
2,What a disapointment,I was hoping that this movie would give additional insight into the Star Wars Saga. It was truly one of the most boring DVD's. If you like watching fighting and shooting the you may like the movie but if you are looking for some dialogue and interesting tidbits of info then you will be disapointed. My three old who is crazy about Star Wars stopped watching after 1/2 an hour.
2,The force is not with this one...,"This animated perversion of Star Wars is an insult to one of the best Sci-Fi epics of all times. The characters are utterly rediculus (seriously, if the jedi were that actually powerful, why did they need the clones?), there is no plotline to speak of, and the entire thing is badly animated and has crappy voice acting. If you want a good build-up to Episode III, I suggest playing Star Wars: Republic Commando and reading Labyrinth of Evil and the other Clone Wars novels. Don't wast your money on this, it's not worth it"
4,Cool Show,"The Clone Wars Series aired on Cartoon Network shortly after Star Wars Episode II came out. This is the chance to check out the events between episode II and III. The animation is from the creator of Dexter's Lab, Powerpuff Girls, and etc... The Clone Wars is not aimed at kids but at fans of Star Wars, but if you have a subscription to Hyperspace on starwars.com you can check out all twenty episodes. The action is faced paced and very little dialoug exsists(a sort of George Lucas directory, he likes to visually tell the stroy not the dialoug). One problem that persists in the clone wars episodes is that the chapters are only 3 to 4 minutes long which cause breaks in the action, it essentially slows down the pace. Otherwise, for the price that amazon is selling this for pick it up."
4,It all comes together,"I would like to say first that this series rocks. I would also like to say to PHOTOGUY from Greenwood, IN who gave it one star and was disapointed with the way it ended and I see your point however CARTOON NETWORK is airing episodes 21-25 starting March 21 to MArch 26. It will pick up where 20 left off with Yoda at the Jedi Council. I'm sure that it will have a better ending to tie in with Episode III. So be patient my friend everything is going to be OK. Now what was disapointing was the STAR WARS HOLIDAY SPECIAL from 1979"
5,A great animated bridge between Episodes I & II,This is a wonderful telling of what took place in the Star Wars saga between Episode II - Attack of the Clones and Episode III - Revenge of the Sith. Very enjoyable.
5,Totally Awesome,"Not to be confused with ""The Clone Wars"" the animated series. These Cartoon 5 minute episodes are strung together in a seamless transition, that never becomes boring.Created by the same director that created ""Dexter's Laboratory"" and ""Samurai Jack"" and serves as a pre-quil to Episode III along with its companion Volume 2.If you like Starwars and you want to see Jedi and Clone awesomeness definitely check this out."
3,Not much substance...,"There is not a lot of substnace in this animated series, for the average veiwer. It seems like it would be better suited for someone in the 8-12 year old range. Or perhaps a good buy for the absolute Star Wars fanatic who has to collect everything. But I am 36, and I also expect some sort of a storyline to go along with the ""over the top"" action. The animation was also a bit childish for my tastes. There were a few minor plot details that were revealed, but they weren't critical to the mythology of the saga. Most reviewers have said that ""Volume 2"" is much better, so I eagerly await it's release."
5,Elevating Animation to Unprecedented Heights,"Wow! All I can say is, shame on you George Lucas for allowing a cartoon to surpass your multi-million dollar epics in both action and story telling. Great, great fun!"
3,"Pretty cool, not worth buying.","Let me start off by saying that I am probably the only person in the world who owns this DVD who has not seen Episode III yet (Sat. May 21), so maybe that will explain my persepctive.My young son and I enjoyed the cartoons, but I don't think they are worth buying. The cartoons are loosely connected, but there is little or no plot or character development. In fact, there is very little dialogue.I don't see myself watching this too many more times; there just isn't a lot of repeat viewing in these. For that reason, I can't recommend buying them. The special features were interesting with good interviews of the creators, but I don't think anything about the DVD really warrants purchasing it."
5,great addition to your star wars collection!,"this and the other volume are well worth seeing and owning. my kids and i watch them all the time, after awhile you dont even feel like it is a cartoon , the voices, the animation, the story. all superb!! better than the computer animated series by far!"
4,Clone Wars Glory!,"I deducted 1 star because these episodes are too brief. They're over in a flash. But just watch 'em back to back and its cool. (And I say that as an avid Adult Swim fan.) But, it's not THAT much of a problem because Clone Wars ROCKS. This here is Star Wars at it's most glorious.What a shame that the films seldom got this good. And what I'm talking about here is the action and drama that the Star Wars galaxy can really be about when a worthy team is in charge of brining it to life. And I sure dig the style of animation. If future Star Wars stories are told this well, then I guess I'll be into Star Wars for years to come. If we get more prequel level stuff, forget about it."
2,Junk!,"The tinyest screw imaginable comes with it, doesn't catch 2 threads, & hole is too small for bigger regular screw from older set."
2,only one bulb,Just be aware that this is not a set but just ONE light bulb and the HappyLite takes two light bulbs. The company did take care of things promptly when I complained which I commend them for but they should change their product description. I just wished I had known I was only getting one bulb since I would have looked elsewhere. And by the way the HappyLite is awesome!
5,Educational & Fun!!,"This video is by far the best I have seen!! It not only focuses on riding dirt bikes and motocross but it is very informational...it teaches kids the importance of safety gear, differences between 2 stroke bikes vs. 4 strokes vs. street bikes, etc! The music, the kids in it and historical fun facts make it very entertaining and educational for kids to watch and even for the parents! It's about time a new video like this came out for everyone. I highly recommend it!!"
3,Decent movie,"I rented this movie from a machine. I didn't know what to expect from it, but it was engaging to watch & good for a few laughs here and there. I LOVED the kid who wrestles--he was great. I would say it isn't a must see but it's not a waste of time either."
3,Better than an infomercial,"Paul Giamatti was his typical neurotic self, which was predictable. The plotline was a bit slow in developing and disorganized. The overall story was mildly entertaining but I would not have gone to the movies to see it. I would definitely wait until it goes on discount. Don't pay full retail for this one."
2,Pointless movie,"I thought I was going to watch an uplifting movie about a man who helps a fatherless teenager. Uplifting, inspiring, motivating are the words I would like to use, but the movie was disappointing and boring. And Paul G's character is really pathetic."
5,Great Movie - Well Acted - New Talent!! 5 Stars,The movie started well setting the story line and it grew from there. Paul Giamatti was wexcellent in his role as all the other cast was too. The Star of the show was the young lad playing the wrestler. He had no previous acting experience and he exhibited more natural talent than I have seen in a long time. Watch this - You will enjoy it.
4,A very good movie,"but I didn't expect Paul Giammati's character to be a douche in this (mainly because the trailers don't paint the movie in that light). The acting is strong from all important cast members and while the plot may not stray from the typical heart-string pulling film, it seems to feel different than the others that have been released in this vein of movie.The only thing I didn't care for was the ending. It felt rushed and didn't feel like the closure this movie was foreshadowing.All said and done this should be seen at least once by people who are looking for a sappy, feel good story. I don't think I would buy this, because I feel as though watching it once was enough."
4,FUNNY AND DRAMATIC -- JUST LIKE LIFE ITSELF,"Paul Giamatti is Mike, a lawyer, father, husband and part-time high school wrestling coach. Financially stressed, he agrees to become legal guardian to an elderly man with mild dementia who has money for his care. When the man's troubled teen grandson shows up and turns out to be an accomplished wrestler, Mike plans for a big win, enrolls him in school and invites the boy to live with them. And then the boy's mother, just out of rehab, tries to get him back and threatens to expose Mike's scheme to make money off her father. Thomas McCarthy directs this light drama that verges on comedy just like real life. I thought of LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE as another indie film in the same vein, also done right."
5,The Best Film of 2011 So Far,"Paul Giamatti is probably the smartest actor in Hollywood. From ""Sideways"" to ""Barney's Version"", he chooses (mostly) very good roles that rely simply on smart acting and writing. ""Win Win"" is one of my favorite movies in a while, as it evokes the small town joy of ""The Station Agent"" with an original story that is accessible to all audiences. Having seen it twice in theaters, I look forward to owning it on Blu-Ray upon release. It's worth every penny. If the people giving awards at the end of the year forget this movie, they are to be shamed - Giamatti, Amy Ryan, and everyone else involved did something special here, and you really should watch it."
5,Great understated film.,"I applaud Mr Giamatti for moving away from trite Hollywood fare to films with genuine character and substance. This is a well-written, superbly performed look into the struggles of real life. I'll avoid spoilers and the usual synopsis, but want to stress this isn't ham-fisted or angsty. Every actor is pitch-perfect, authentic dialogue, credible scenes...well done all around. Worth your time and money."
2,Not Memorable,"In fact, I forget what it was about. People remember a good movie, ergo (conclusion left to the reader as an exercise). Wait a minute! I do remember it was heartwarming! (Doncha hate that?)If you want a wrestling movie, see Vision Quest from 1985. I still remember what that was about. It was about coming of age, and it was about wrestling. This movie was about... Oh yeah. I forget."
5,An unexpected gem.,"I am one of the biggest Paul Giamatti fans in the world. So much so in fact, I buy anything he stars in. I came across this movie recently and was surprised I had never even heard of it before. When I saw it starred Giamatti I purchased it right then and there. Once again he proves to be one of America's best and most versatile talents. It's nice it has an R rating and isn't edited/watered down... it seems more real this way. This is one of the best movies of the year."
4,Very funny,Finally a movie about wrestling everyone can enjoy! My 14 and 16 year olds laughed thru the entire movie.. We recomend it!
5,Great!,"My son was a wrestler in high school. I came to love and respect the sport. It is a real character builder and very exciting to watch.""Win Win"" is very well acted with Paul Giamatti playing the lead. He is a family man and a lawyer in financial trouble. He and his wife take in a boy who turns out to be a champion wrestler from Ohio. Paul coaches wrestling in his spare time.The story has many unexpected twists and turns. It is a satisfying, emotional experience."
4,Heart Warming Fun!,Win Win is a sweet movie. All the characters were funny in a different way. I graduated from a small high school that had difficulty winning at sports. This movie reminded me how truly exciting it is to watch someone excel and how it is uplifting to an entire team.
3,I've Seen Worse -- AND BETTER!,"Predictable, run-of-the-mill crowd pleaser about a troubled young teeanger with a talent for wrestling, his dysfunctional, drug-addicted mother, a stubborn grandfather in the initial stage of dementia, an average American family with an important choice to make, and a slightly shady (but forgivable) Good Samaratin, played by Paul Giamatti. Put them all together and you've got the perfect bland ingredients for your average Hallmark/Lifetime production -- good enough to watch...ordinary enough to forget.Pretty boy Alex Shaffer, as Kyle -- he won the New Jersey State Wrestling Championship in 2010 at the age of 17 -- turns in an affecting performance. Bobby Cannavale as coach Terry Delfino couldn't be more annoying if his career depended on it."
3,Got Refurbished and on Arrival it was Dead - Battery connation was not there,It was DOA - it won't light up. I thought it's charring the battery - left it like that for 2 hours no singe of life. Then thought let me check out the battery if it is there or not [Who knows!] - opened the battery compartment [ At the bottom of UPS - you need to take of 5 small screws ] and there I see the one of the connection to battery was not made correctly [ the black wire was not connected to battery ] - once I did that and put back the battery it powered up !Make sure you press the one/off switch for more then 3 seconds then you will here a beep and Green light indicator will turn on.I think the Panel Indicator are all reveres - as per the Diagram #5 is [Overload/Abnormal Indicator ] - but for me the #5 is [AC Normal/On Battery Indicator (green)] ... Oh well ...will update the post if it does not work .
1,Bad design,"I would suggest staying away from this UPS. Apparently, there is no way to turn on the UPS when the battery is low. Only the surge outlets will have power. A tech support guy at Energizer said the UPS would have to charge 8 to 10 hours before you could turn it on. Who the hell designs a UPS like this?Stay away from this UPS. It's cheap for a reason when others in the a same or lower power class cost more."
2,A disappointment,"I bought this book on a whim and had to say I was disappointed from the first page but get the book the benefit of the doubt. The idea of a 19 year old falling head over heals with a 31 year old and saying things along the lines of ""I know you will love me and marry me"" is just not ideal. They way that the characters talk to each other are also not realistic. There was also no heat between the characters."
3,"OK, but needs more information!","I've read all the DJ books out there, and this one seems to miss many important technical points. It doesn't cover much on beat matching and scratching, and the song lists are dated. It is easy to read and does have some good information on real business setups, but you can get that almost anywhere!"
3,An excellent guide for the aspiring DJ,"The Mobile DJ Handbook was written as an excellent guide for the aspiring DJ to begin his or her new business, however it is also a great refresher for the experienced mobile DJ as well. The book contains great ideas on how to expand and develop your business through learning to market and sell your company.The Handbook covers all of the bases when it comes to your business. You can find sample brochures, letters, contracts, and information sheets. For the beginner, there is information on buying equipment, running your shows, setting your price, and essentially, how to be a professional. The mobile dj field is a fun and exciting business to be involved in and this book will help you be successful in it.Probably one of the best things about the Mobile DJ Handbook is the fact that it is written in down to earth language. By taking advice and ideas from many of the industry leaders, Stacy has made the path much easier for the first time company owner."
3,A Good Start,This book provides a generic outline and a good start for the topic. There needs to be a followup with more info and detailed guidance on how to go from point A to point B. The book leaves you at the starting gate.
2,Brief Non Descriptive Info.,"This Book did contain some brief useful information. But lacks description,not focused enough for beginners."
2,Not what I expected,"Totally made out of plastic. Since you have to turn the knob all the way around and back to the desired time, it gets stuck 20% of the time. You have to pull the knob upwards to let it loose enough to tick. I'm going to take it apart and see if I can fix it before I throw it away. Probably the knob is rubbing against the casing and stops moving. Anyway, it looks better than it works."
3,Great timer but faulty design.,"At first I was so pleased with this timer. The size was large enough to read the numbers easily and it was easy to operate and the chrome finish was easy to clean. The ring was loud and the timing accurate enough. I also liked the magnet attached to the back which allowed me to easily park it on the refigerator in easy sight. But about two weeks after I recieved it, the magnet came loose and the timer fell to the floor and was broken....so I do not have my timer anymore. I was dissapointed."
1,Time is up on this Timer!,"Such a clever idea, ideal for multi~tasking, you can cook, clean, and run the trash out with no worries of your meal being over cooked with this handy little timer...that is what I was hopeing when I ordered it. My clever idea arrived and doesn't work. It ticks, loudly at that, and doesn't advance. I wish I could tell you what the bell sounds like but that too does not work. I went to stick it on the refridgerator to deal with later and the thing started to slide down so I can't even use it as a magnet. The chrome is thin, leaving it super lite, so it must be that the magnet is not the best. Personally, I would reccomend a completely different brand. That is what I will be doing. The price was so low that the trip to the post would cost me the same as the gas it would take to get there so it is now my 5 year olds new toy...he loves it!"
1,1 out of 2 isn't enough,"I bought two of these as stocking stuffers. Tried them both today. One ticks for about five minutes and then stops. It doesn't matter how long its been set for, it has yet to actually make it to zero and ring the bell. The other seems fine so far but that means I spent $11.00 for a single kitchen timer. I also bought the yellow one for my daughter. Don't know yet whether it works or not. Won't be buying from this company again."
3,magnetic kitchen timer with string,"It was what I was looking for and I gave them as gifts. On trying them, the bell was a little shallow (could have had more body behind the ring) but haven't heard anything bad about them."
4,Useful gadget for the hard of hearing,"I got this because I can no longer hear my regular kitchen timer, and really like using this one. I set it and hang it around my neck, and then go on and do my usual activities, without worrying I won't hear the timer."
2,order did not arrive; required replacement,The order never came; when notified Amazon replaced it. Now Amazon threatens to charge my account for a product that was never delivered.
1,not at all what I expected,"Although the price seemed too good to be true, still I expected something better. What I got looked and felt more like a toy. The plastic housing was painted and felt like it would easily shatter to pieces if dropped. The timer worked some time, and some time not. The dial often stuck, sometimes not turning at all. And frankly, I don't think the timer was truly accurate. I guess this is simply a case of you get what you pay for. If I wanted something from Toys R Us, I would have gone there. And one more thing...the picture is misleading. It's a lot bigger than it looks. I didn't like it bouncing around as it hung around my neck."
1,dead on arrival,"I read the reviews of timers dead on arrival, but I figured that it wouldn't happen to me. then I received the timer.summary: good-looking, strong magnet, but IT WOULDN'T RING!ridiculous.I had to open it up and fiddle with the inner mechanism in order to get the ringer to work.save yourself the trouble, and pick it up at your local store. or order another timer."
4,timer -- chrome,gave this to my grandson as he needed a timer and his kitchen is stainless and thought this was a good one for him
2,Not what I expected,"This timer is much larger than it looks. I was expecting this small timer that I could hang around my neck to time my yoga sessions - but this is 2 1/2"" in diameter, and including the hanger at the top, it's 3"". It's also over 1 1/4"" thick at the center. It's not too heavy, though. The ""windup"" is a bit counter-intuitive: you turn it clockwise until it hits 60, then counter-clockwise to the time you want to set it. I guess I'll get used to it. What bugs me more is the ""execution"" of the timer - if you set it for less than 5 minutes, it seems to go off a minute early. It's plenty loud, just doesn't go off when expected. Over all, I can't recommend it."
2,All because of timer bell....,"Pros: i like the manual (not digital) / no batteries needed / can hang around neck or doorknob (anywhere close so i don't ignore) bell / color (there was yellow which i also liked) / not heavy (light plastic chrome).Cons: not sure this was working right (many times bell did not ring when it hit""0"" / the dial kept buzzing beyond ""0"" ) / timer bell sounded for only one second so if there are other noises/interruptions you will definitely miss hearing it / seemed cheaply built and may be a bit high priced (about $6) but free shipping for over $25 purchases made this purchase good for me except item did not work well.Note: appreciated Cust.Svc for hearing my problem."
2,Poor Quality!,We bought this timer to hang in the bathroom so my son would know when to get out of the shower (he is worse than my daughter in there!). This timer only worked half the time and was not accurate.
2,Mediocre wireless mouse,"Last time I checked, a Microsoft wireless mouse is few bucks cheaper so definitely opt for that if you are reading this. For $13, it still doesn't worth the money. The scroll roller on mine isn't align in the center either. Now if you're one of those Microsoft haters, still go for something else over this Gear Head mouse. Like couple reviewers already said, the battery life lasts approximately 1-2 weeks. The Sunbeam Extra Heavy Duty lasted a little over a week with only ~2 hours of use every day. Moreover the cursor freezes over time which means after you type, you would either have to click once to reactivate its sensor or expect to wait couple seconds to go where you wanted to go. In summary, avoid this product unless it's given to you as a gift."
5,Just right!,"Great jar. The right size for my pound of coffee beans. I have this one for decaff, and the plain top for regular coffee beans. Fill the bill"
1,"Way too Expensive, 5.99 at other retailers!!!!!!!","Way too Expensive, 5.99 (with out the blue top) at other retailers!!!!!!! Try ""The Container Store or Sur La Table"""
1,piece of junk,"If anybody out there is thinking of buying this door, don't. Pay a little more but get something that actually works. The door's roller isn't smooth or easy to extend and retract. A waste of $100."
3,"Okay, but could be better","This book (small 3-ring binder), has some interesting recipes, but not very many, considering the new price of the book. The author uses stevia and malitol for sweeteners.The biggest problem I have with the book is that there is no nutritional information provided other than the carb count per serving. Carbs are not the only thing people are keeping track of when trying to eat. Some of the recipes (such as the mashed cauliflower ones) use more full-fat dairy products than you really need. Low-Carb doesn't always have to be high fat.On the other hand, there is enough extra space in the binder to put in some of your own low-carb holiday recipes, if you want to.Borrow from your library first, before buying."
1,Can't serve the stuff,"Thanksgiving dinner hasn't even been served yet, and already the pumpkin soup and trial-run gravy have gone down the drain, literally. The soup had the appearance and texture of wet cement and absolutely no flavor. The gravy, supposedly thickened with almond flour, was runny and gritty. Neither was fit to serve. Fortunately, I chose the rest of Thanksgiving dinner from Fran McCullough's low-carb cookbooks, which I have used with great success before. McCullough has excellent taste; John Owen apparently has none at all."
5,A soulful pleasure indeed!,"I heard this CD while shopping and found it so pleasing that I bought it on the spot. It has become one of my favorite albums, and am only disappointed that no other releases by this wonderfully talented duo have followed 9 years hence. Featured instruments of voice and harp are supported by an equally engaging ensemble of bass, synthesizer, and percussion to provide a soothing, jazzy experience of mysterious depth and silky contour. The imaginative production and sonic treatments make this a truly magical event. Highly recommended for relaxation, contemplation, gentle grooving, and quiet jubilations of the spirit!"
3,good... not great,"I purchased this book to reference for my painting. I found the variety and quantity of photos great, however the quality of the photos is questionable. Most of them are grainy (an artistic treatment?) and some appear to be low res images scaled up to fit the format of the book. The paper and print quality could be better, but if you read it to learn about clouds it would suffice."
1,Don't waste your money,"I ordered this book for my father for Christmas and I had really hoped it would be something special. We have a sentimental love of clouds and I thought this book would be the perfect gift. I am also a photography student and, naturally, love great photographs. This book was a disappointment. It is cheaply made, and all the pictures are grainy. The cover looks beautiful from a distance, and that's about it."
4,My name is Arnt - Ivar,"The book of Clouds are a very beautiful book, very interesting, and with illustrating pictures.The only thing that is not so good, is the fact that the glue that should keep tha pages together is too weak. That causes the pages to fall out."
5,Book of Clouds,"this is a beautifully illustrated book, full of pictures plus descriptions. The book arrived in good time and in perfect condition. We were very pleased and delighted."
1,Amazon Mislead me and ripped me off big time,"Alright so I heard in the grape vine that American Idol David Cook had a CD out previously on his own so I looked it up on Amazon and ""Thought"" I found it. Wrong. For one don't trust a site that has American Idol contestants all over the site and telling you that this is his CD. There was no photo or Genre posting I just assumed it was the CD. After a week after the delivery date was posted for I received the package and I found out I was fooled. This is not American Idol David Cook this is a Jazz CD. WHATTF IS THIS. I am sooooo mad. Do not order if you think this is David Cook. This is a David cook playing piano and not singing at all. They are making you pay an outrageous $23.00 for a dumb jazz cd that nobody has ever heard of. I hope they will refund my money for misleading everyone who had done the same.. DON'T DO IT."
1,Pre Idol David Cook Music,"David Cook pre-Idol's band name is a Missori Band named Axium. I've had trouble finding the cds here, and on Itunes. Go to wikipedia for links, and more Axuim info. I wasn't a fan but his covers of Eleanor Rigby and Billie Jean has me looking for his music."
4,A Very Good Book,"A history of the ministry of Victory Outreach, this book focuses on the beginning of the church and its founder, Sonny Arguinzoni, Sr. It shows how Pastor Sonny overcame heroine addiction and was raised up to lead the hurting and lost from their affliction and toward Jesus Christ, portraying the struggles he and his wife went through during the first few years.This book is a must for anyone who is or wants to be involved in a ministry that focuses on drug addicts gang members.The title of this books comes from a promise given to Sonny when he first started in his ministry, found in Isaiah 45:1,2.Aside from a few grammatical and typographical errors, this book is awesome. I couldn't put it down until I was finished."
1,Not usable,Purchased this for my grandson BUT the directions for putting it up were absent and it kept falling off the rim. Notified the dealer but the response was poor. Eventually he gave up and went back to a regular net.
5,"It's really a Koyo, the top rated brand for Mazda Miatas","Someone on the Miata forum had mentioned they bought this TYC radiator and that it arrived in a Koyo box and with a Koyo part number so someone, for whatever reason, is branding them and selling them really inexpensively. I used Koyo's extensively on refurbishing Miatas and never had one fail and was pleasantly surprised to see that this is a genuine product without even an attempt to disguise the packaging. For the price it sells for on Amazon, it simply cannot be beat."
2,Lynol LR1140,"Date of this review shows the purchase date not the date I wrote it.EDIT: By reports in the miata forum if you buy directly from Amazon you will get a KOYO, if you buy from a 3rd party seller it might be some other brand.As of October 2012 reports are coming in that TYC is now shipping Lynol radiators so this may no longer be a KOYO A1140.TYC is a reboxer/relabler and still should be a quality product but it might be wise to check prices on a Lynol LR1140 before ordering this TYC."
4,Reminisce on Days Gone By,"This compilation of hits, took me back to the days of yesteryear, when I was a little girl, in NE DC. My Childhood was a good time and there was always good music. Music that made you happy, music that identified, with whatever you were going through, and Al Green was a staple in my family's component set. To hear his smooth, melodic voice again, transports me back to those days and makes me reminisce on those days long gone."
3,Al Green Greatist Hits,"About half of the CD was good to listen to. I mostly bought it for the song, ""Let's Stay Together""."
1,Worship 101,"Willaim Cosgrove is probably an excellent fireman, good husband and father, etvc. But he is not even a fair writer. Hired to be Robert De Niro's technical assitant for the making of the movie Backdraft, Cosgrove's prose resembles that of a love-sick tween describing a back-stage encounter with a pop music star. Other than knowing that De Niro is famous, and that movies are made, Cosgrove shows no deeper knowledge of his subjects than was presented to him during this experience. Thus, no analysis or depth - strictly a chronological narrative, without any insights."
3,More History than Action,"This DVD was a great documentary on the history of Grave Digger and monster truck racing. I bought this for my 2 year old thinking it would have more footage of actual races, which is not the case. Still, overall it's a great DVD for those who want the ""behind the scenes"" review."
3,Beethoven in his bed,"This was a fair cd. It was not one of Beethoven's best, however it is not bad at all. It is definitely worth a try."
1,be weary,"I do not own this book myself, but after a little bit of research it is clear to me that this book cannot be trusted as an authentic Islamic resource for dream interpretations.From what I can gather, the only contribution that Ibn Seerin has made to the subject of dream interpretation is a compilation of prophetic traditions particular to dreams and their interpretation."
4,Ibn Seerin's Book,"It is a good book with a collection of lots of traditions within Islamic cultures for dream interpretation. However, I would have preferred not to have such huge paragraphs, as such large paragraphs are not easy to read. Other than that, this is a recommended book, but should be revised to make it easy to read. Otherwise I would give it 5 stars."
3,No mp3 download available,"Great music, but why is none of their ""Meanwhile"" CD available in mp3 download at 0.99 each like all their other recordings? I only want one song off this CD. I don't want to buy the entire CD just for one song. The recording industry wants to discourage illegal file sharing, and plenty of people are more than happy to pay a buck for a song they want, IF they can FIND it, so this makes no sense.I gave this CD 3 stars rather than 5 stars, ONLY because none of it is available in individual mp3 download."
5,Nina's first masterpiece,"I had to buy this album because my father had it on vinyl. It is unique among her albums in that there are several purely instrumental pieces that my father adored. There are also a number of classics on here not on her ultimate collection or greatest hits. The introduction to ""Little Girl Blue"" is one of the most memorable and creative pieces of hers ever.One of my most treasured albums."
5,Excellent Book,I found this book to be a very easy read. Many of the subjects I have studied indepth before but this book hit the highlights and was a good refresher. I highly recomment.
5,Learn to think like a data modeler,"I can understand why this book has gotten some mixed reviews. The author addresses many common modeling problems. But readers looking for instant solutions to those problems will probably be disappointed. Those looking for oop patterns are reading the wrong book. And anyone looking for a beginner's introduction to data modeling will be completely lost. But if you've been feeling as if your database designs could be better, but you're not sure how, you need this book.Mr. Hay covers many real-world modeling problems. His discussions of these problems give incredible insight into the thought process of a professional data modeler. That is the true value of this book.I first read this book about three years ago and now I am totally embarrassed by every database I created before. I've re-read it many times since and my copy is beaten and dog-eared. Thankfully, it's a hardcover book.Make sure you read all the footnotes in the book. Some of them are hysterically funny."
5,The best I have read on the subject,"I have been in Data modeling for now more than 10 years and thought I knew what I was talking about. Hay proved me wrong. Even the Universal model which I was so proud to have discovered on my own is there in almost all possible uses and combination (minus one, but I'll only share it with the VERY interested ones). I have had this book at hand for almost a year now and it is one of the few I consult almost daily. My only grudge is it is based on the Oracle methodology. But this is a very personal grudge."
5,The Thinking Person's Resource,"There are two ways of modelling business environments.The first is how they like you to do it in tightly controlled organizations like the military -- ""Follow this exact nine-step procedure and your data model will fall out the end of it"".The second is to apply an intelligent, informed, and flexible approach -- it is this method that the book addresses, and it is far superior in my eyes.Those interested in data modelling by rote should look elsewhere, because this is an excellent resource that will be wasted on you."
3,Relational modeling and not object modeling,"With heavy emphasis in the manufacturing and supply-chain world, this book provides a treasure-chest of reusable concepts and data modeling frameworks on which to grow to model a business. Strongly slanted towards relational database modeling, it has a totally different flavor than from a book slanted towards object modeling, such as Analsys Patterns by Martin Fowler. A cheaper version of this book, and in my view just as good is The Data Model Resource Book by Len Silverston. It would be nice to see this book into a second edition with XML templates representing invoices, customers, contacts, billing item, etc etc."
2,A rather dated book; now a disappointment,"There is a lot of positive word-of-mouth about this book.However, when I recently read it I found it a real disappointment.Maybe it was an important book when it was published but it has now been superceded by considerably more interesting and complete books on the subjects of patterns and modelling (for example Analysis Patterns by Martin Fowler).The patterns presented are often rather simplistic and provide little new insight for experienced modellers."
2,Not Practical,"This book provides you with patterns for creating conceptual data models. It's not practical, though, in that it does not provide insight into how to go from conceptual to real. In fact, it's almost useless.These ""patterns"" are nothing more than concepts that good data modelers instinctively know already.Also, his ER modeling techniques are a bit outdated.Finally, this book is very, very dense and difficult to read. He just describes how to set up the models in very dense language, without going into the why's. It becomes virtually unreadable after the second or third pattern.There are other, more recent books out there which provide better, more up to date thinking on this nascent topic (which I believe is still years, if not decades away from truly practical modeling/process techniques)."
4,The Human Side of Cancer,I just liked reading about other peoples feelings and how they dealt with their various types of cancer. I am currently in remission of ovarian cancer and plan to stay there.
2,Just another persons opinion,If you are looking for information this book (As the title says) does not provide information on the medical side of Cancer. It is about people involved in the day to day struggle of living with and hopefully recovering from this disease. I don't think this is a bad book and some people may love the human qualitites it brings to the disease it just was not in my opinion the correct book for me at the time I read it.
3,quaternary,"this book that concerns with quaternary environments, is one of the best reviewed one. However, if it is comperated with ""reconstructing quaternary environments"" by walker and lowe, it is lack of some metods relating palaeogeographical reconstructing."
3,Take a Trip to Serenity - 3rd book of the series,"Feels Like Family (Sweet Magnolias) by Sherryl Woods is the 3rd book in the series. I of course started with this book - opps. In this novel Helen Decatur is a lawyer who a strong attraction to , handsome pastry chef Eric Whitney. There is lots of story lines and some great twist. Off to read the previous books's Stealing Home and Slice of Heaven."
4,Feels like family,This series is a fun good reading books. This one was up lifting and yet kept you wanting more at the end. I think starting with the 1st book and keep going you will enjoy them all.
2,Boring,It was very boring. It took me forever to finish. I didn't really like the story lines. Way too many. Elliott & Erik were way too wimpy. Karen had everyone fixing her life. Who does that? I would not recommend this book.
2,"Wow, these are small!","These are really small - 15mm. And, they are much stiffer than the Medela shields. Even if they fit, I'm not sure my baby would like the stiff material. Personally, I'm going to stick with the Medela shields. The 21mm size are so hard to find, though!"
3,small,It is small.May be I don't use it. Don't know whether to use. But feel like the quality of this brand is good
4,A not-so-scary Halloween book for young children,"This is a reprint of a book originally published in 1994. It's a fun collection of mostly poetry with a few short stories, riddles, jokes and even a song thrown in. The entries were written by a variety of well-known children's authors and colorfully illustrated by Marc Brown (who is best known for his ""Arthur"" books).The collection is about ""scary"" things such as witches, monsters, ghosts, and more, although most of the entries are humorous rather than frightening. A few of the poems deliver just enough menace to give a child some delighted shivers.It's a good book for young children who aren't yet ready for really scary stories, and a great collection for parents or teachers looking for a little extra something to liven up a Halloween storytime for the young ones."
2,Rambling Essays,"This book does not focus on ""Gold of the Gods."" Instead, it is a series of essays about random subjects related to the ""astronaut theory."" In fact, the reads like a travelogue of fascinating places von Daniken visted. His analysis is lacking, to say the least. His writing is dismal and disconnected. He is so taken by his own reputation to dispute ""status quo"" archaeological theories that he seems to consider his willingness to question things to be the proof that the standard analysis is wrong. Really not worth reading unless you are a die hard von Daniken fan, a committed believer in the astronaut theory or you just want to learn about some unexplained archaeological sites that might be worth a visit."
3,Not his best book,Von Daniken sucks you into this great story about caves in South America and then drifts off that and starts talking about random stuff.
2,new sensational revvelations!,"this book unveils new evidence of an intergalactic ""battle of the gods"" whose losers retreated to & settled,earth. it explores a vast mysterious underworld of ecuador - caves filled with gold and writings in solid gold that go back in time to the great flood to bolster von daniken's theory of a prehistoric earthly ""era of the gods""."
2,Jaun Moricz dead and still no gold?,"Van Däniken seems to see Ancient Astronauts in every piece of ancient design? No real artifacts have ever been found to prove this kind of theory.If the crystal sculls of the current Indy movie were true,this Ecuador set of tunnels/ mines or caves would be the logical place?Yet since 1972 there has been no real proof that any of this story has a real basis in fact. There has been a scandal in New World archaeology oversuppression of data about pre-Clovis sites, so one can conclude that maybe that is true in other areas of the field as well.Archaeologists don't appear to be open minded or scientific in many cases about data collection or sources.But Van Däniken's many theories and speculations appear to be just tissue..."
3,"Nice collection of mysteries, poor analysis","The Gold of the Gods talks about, among other things, underground tunnels in Ecuador, the lost city of Nan Madol, and the Chinese creation story of Pan Ku.The author claims that space aliens were involved. But there is no real evidence supporting his theory, unless you except myths as fact. Overall this book stinks."
4,"Great detail, limited poseability","The detail and paint-job of the McFarlane ""Dog Alien"" from Alien3 is pretty good. I dislike that on the head, the seam between the top and bottom halves is very obvious and not at all realistic to the movie. I do like that there is a button at the back of the head to pop out the ""inner jaw"", and the tail is very poseable.However, the reason I am giving this toy 4 stars instead of 5 is that there is no articulation at the elbows and knees, and so the poseability of this toy is quite limited. However, it looks great on my shelf with the other aliens, so in the end I am pretty satisfied."
3,Victor Products Patch Kit,"I have been riding bicycles for over thirty years, so I have had numerous flat tires. In the past there was only this type of patch kits available (with the rubber cement needing to be applied). This is a Brand name product which tends to bond better compared to the newer ""self sticking"" patches. Although those are easier to apply quickly on the road, I still like to have the old fashioned more permanent patches available."
1,victor 00402-8 EZ fix rubber tire patch kit,I have order 4 of your tirer patchs @ .88 cents each paid 5. and change But I ony received only one So when will i be get the other 3
4,The Anxiety Workbook,"I am finding that this workbook is very helpful and giving me more confidence in myself. Also, I was amazed at the speed that it was delivered to me.This workbook contains many great exercises and pages on which to record your results."
4,Comprehensive,"Excellent...Comprehensive. Every approach worth considering that I know of is covered and many more...and coherently put together, not just a jumble of unrelated techniques. Only reason I haven't given it the full 5 stars is because I haven't been putting it into practice yet, and so can't unequivocably vouch for the results yet."
5,Really helps,"I started to thumb through it, and it really helps me to understand what problems I really have and how to combat them."
5,Excellent!,"Excellent information, very interesting reading and wonderfully written. I highly recommend it for anyone seeking understanding and help with anxiety. It as also excellent reading for anyone interested in learning about anxiety disorders."
4,Good book in general to learn about Anxiety,"Well, I bought this book becaue I was feeling ""out of sorts"" for a while and thought it was anxiety. The book did a great job breaking down the topic and providing ways to control anxiety etc. It turns out I wasn't suffering from anxiety but low blood sugar. I wish my doctor found that out sooner but I am still glad I bought this book because it did have helpful tips that I can use in general."
4,understanding,"Have to give anyone an A+ for using this book, taking action, understanding and resolving their problem."
3,Not Sure,"This sems like it could be a great help for someone suffering with anxiety, however it can also be very overwhelming. It is definately not a quick fix. This is more like a study guide, kinda like taking a class. If you need immediate help, I suggest seeing a professional as apposed to buying this book. If you have plenty of time on your hands and your anxiety os already under control, then this book can be helpful."
5,Must-Have for anyone with anxiety,This workbook is like two years of therapy rolled into a bedtime story. The exercises are especially helpful.
5,Practical Workbook - take action!,"I noticed most of the reviews on this workbook were dated. Just wanted you to know that it is still one of the best around for working on specific anxiety issues. I am a therapist who suggests this workbook all the time. Notice I say workbook, not book, because unless you follow the directions and complete the questionnairs if won't be helpful to you. It is basic CBT and it works. Take action by setting goals and using the weekly practice record."
5,The Anxiety and Phobia Workbook,"This book was very helpful; actually suggested by a doctor. He lent us the book, and we thought it was so helpful, we bought a copy. It is easy to understand--divided into different categories of anxiety; the causes of this problem, and helpful, easy to use suggestions to use every day."
4,Good Overview for someone suffering from phobia or anxiety,The only thing it lacked is specific examples. And some easy remedies. Other than that it is a great book to read!
5,Best help for panic attacts,Most effective methods to ease panic/anxiety attacts in easy to understand text.
4,helpful,"I mailed this book to my daughter at college. She suffers from TEST ANXIETY.. She said it was helpful, although she only read a small portion of the book. Only time will tell."
4,Anxiety Help,I use this book frequently to help educate people on anxiety disorders. Very easy to read and practical.
4,Lots of Helpful Information Here,"The Anxiety & Phobia Workbook, Fourth EditionThis book was recommended by my child's psychiatrist to help her with her social phobia. It is full of helpful information although much of it was familiar because she has been in counseling in the past. Nonetheless, it deserves 4 stars for depth and breadth of information, helpful format, and price. Buy it!"
5,Best Available Resource,"As a long-time sufferer of Panic Disorder, later complicated by Agoraphobia, I have read many, many books on the subject, and this is by far the best. It is comprehensive and familiar. There are exercises and information that will indeed help you to conquer what can be a debilitating and is always a quality-of-life-diminishing disorder. It includes the gamut---from OCD through Agoraphobia. I was frankly surprised (and pleased) that it includes a lengthy section on the spiritual aspect of fighting anxiety. I highly recommend it."
5,College counseling,"This is a very helpful book for my practice, especially when working with college students"
4,A GREAT MOVIE!!,This is a hilarious redo of a already GREAT movie. This is a must buy for everyone!!
2,Medicore humor that could easily be better,"I love the Thumbnation concept, but unlike Thumb Wars this one just doesn't deliver humor for me. It's attemps to spoof God Father are weak as there are hints and pieces of GodFather in here, but it's not very obvious. If this movie was a concise spoof of just the 1st or all 3 God Fathers I would have had a blast but this was more like some rambling story with some characters influenced by God Father. Even at it's fair price (considering it is a 30min movie maybe it isn't all that fair) I would have to say this isn't worth buying."
3,GodThumb Induces Nausea,"This was my seccond installment in the Thumb Series, my girlfriend and I are avid watchers of Steve Oedekerk's Thumb Creations, though the God Thumb seems to have some extra-sensroy capabilities. At one point during our seccond viewing of GodThumb, during the scene with the incredibly overweight thumb, played by the character from Thumb Wars known as 'Gabba the Butt' I became incredibly nauseas and was unable to continue watching. Later on in the evening my girlfiend told me that after some thought on the same scene she began to experience the same feeling, does Gabbe the Butt induce upset stomachs ? Will the truth be told ?! Has anyone had any similar experiences ?"
1,The Godthumb,"Not the best of the series. I loved Thumbtanic, & ThumbWars. This one was very disappointing. Not a single laugh on my part."
2,Not as good as the other thump pics,"Godthumb just wasn't as good as the other thumb pics. If you don't have any get The Blair Thumb or Thumb Wars. There was only one funny spot in Godthumb and that was during the ""out takes"" with the orange peel. I think he rushed this one."
4,Thumbelina got nothing on you babe,"..(Discover Your Inner Wisdom: Using Intuition, Logic, and Common Sense to Make Your Best Choices) next to Char MArgolis,Steve Oedekerk's got the hottest thing going: SeXy,(a woman's dream..Char can you top that?)tough gangster thumbS making women feel like they know what turns them on.."
4,Fishing Muddy Water,"I have just finished reading Greg's new book. In fact, I have read it twice. The story is set in Missouri and tells of his experiences while fishing on the Mississippi River. He begins the book in Hannibal, which is the small town where Mark Twain was born and raised. In many ways, this book reminds me of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. In fact, Greg's writing style is reminiscent of Twain's. This new book is a ""good read"" and I would recommend it."
4,"Invasive, honest and blunt","The book is a must for anyone interested in Cuba's efforts to endorse the ""exportation of the Revolution"". The author does not simply give his very personal first-hand experience as one of Che Guevera's protegees in the Cuban Revolution, but he goes on to expand his following Che in Bolivia, where he is one of the less than a handful of survivors. But the part I found most compelling was his experience as a trainer of foreigner rebels trained in Havana.The narrative is compelling and sounds pretty honest to me, including the ideological regrets he expresses. It's obvious that the writer is no experienced author or highly educated person, but the recording of modern history is o major interest in an almost amateur but blunt way.Do not expect literary embellishments, flowery descriptions or emotional narration. Do expect to get a first hand description of how secret services, revolutionary movement, Che Guevara and Fidel personally operated.Breathtaking."
3,"Hmm, not easy really...","This was great as my daughter is just learning the piano and is a huge HSM fan. However, it is NOT easy!! Even her piano teacher is having difficulty!! Great for a fan though!!"
3,"Not ""Easy""","My 14 year old bought this because she has been learning to play the piano (1 year) and was excited to work on something fun on the side. We must be naive about ""Easy Piano"" because it is not in our minds. Nonetheless she is steadfastly attempting to master her first song."
4,High School Musical (Easy Piano),"I bought this for my 14 year old son, who is taking piano lesson's, and loved the movie's. He was very pleased with and is playing from this song book."
3,Red Skelton - The Ultimate Collection,"Frankly, I was disapointed that it was all his older stuff and was all black and white. I don't really care for his earlier routines and like his later acts much more. I think that the color routines would sell much better."
3,"Disc one: Magic, Disc two: [bad]","Why can't both discs be good. I don't know about you, but I just hate it when the second disc in a 2 cd set kills the great mood that cd 1 put you in. What a disapointment. At least there's five good songs on cd 2. (No where near cd 1's awesome array of good trance tracks.) The five songs I like on cd 2 are Aquagen's ""Ihr seid so leise"" (good but too much german talk), Cosmic Gate's ""Mental Atmosphere"" (awesome, but too short), Asys' ""Acid save your soul"" (the best song I've ever heard by Asys), Km/h's ""Legends"" (with a great pulsing climax), Samurai's ""Tanzen"" (I think that's german for dance), and Up Server's ""Mood Swings"" (reminds me so much of that song ""Dream Universe"" off of volume 8.) I guess the first disc is what I paid the money for!!"
1,Zak Tools Consealable Handcuff Key broke on first try,"This is the only handcuff key that I have broken, and it broke on the first try. A piece of the key is stuck inside the handcuffs preventing the double lock from functioning--effectively ruining a quality set of handcuffs. The seller agreed to give me a refund and offered me a discount on other Zak Tools Handcuff Keys, but I cannot trust that company after how easily that key broke."
4,I liked it!,Its very heavy & sturdy. I bought it for my boyfriend. Its exactly as pictured. Sorry for the late review but I bought it years ago lol
1,Not as advertised- Buyer beware,"The ad states that this combo works with the Maxxum 7D- the very first camera listed-- the camera does not detect the lense so it does not take a picture. There are no contacts on the lense or the adapter to coincide the the contacts on the camera.I shipped this lense to work and put the package in the hopper before I went home for the day so there is no chance of returning it for ""store credit"". I know that that part of it is my fault. Shame on me for believing what I had read about the product and not testing it as soon as I had opened the box.I will not be doing business with this company again. I ordered the lense 2nd Day Air as I am going to watch the shuttle launch this weekend. Sorry to say it is too late to order any other lense and have it in time for the trip."
4,"Does the job, good price",A hole saw - cuts holes - looks and works exactly as described. This is an unusual size that I've used to install special door viewers.Price ($9.60) is much better than local hardware stores.
1,ulitmate fighter,"I bought this and other like it for a friend who doesn't have access. I won't even consider watching them. Violence for the sake of violence is insane, or so I think."
4,Smart Strip,Works as described. It does save some energy since it shuts off unwanted energy vampires. Easy to use and it has a sufficient amount of plugs.
4,Smart Strip,I waited to write this review until I received my first electric bill using this product. Seeing my electric usage drop by 40 points is very satisfying.
3,OK,"Terrific idea, but execution is a little unreliable. I have this hooked up to one of my home entertainment systems. It sometimes takes awhile for it to cut power to the other receptacles, or never does cut the power. Adjusting the sensitivity is supposed to solve this problem, but it doesn't work reliably. In addition to this model, I have a different one (with less outlets) that works reliably on a different home entertainment setup."
5,Perfect,This works exactly as advertised. I am using a 250 Watt CRT TV in the control outlet. It switches just fine without having to make any adjustments.
5,save money,"while I have only used one smart strip so far, it works and there has been a savings seen in just one month of use..."
2,"After about 5-10 uses, it just functions as a regular powerstrip...","I purchased two of the Smart Strips because of the good reviews, but very quickly both of my units have reverted to typical power strips after only 5-10 uses. The strips functioned properly and shut off/turned on all devices according to design at the beginning, but the energy saving function quickly stopped ""working"". At least I have two regular power strips, but the energy saving feature appears to be extremely fragile, and no ""calibration"" seems to return it to functioning. I would recommend searching for other brands or devices that offer power saving functions, and unfortunately I would not recommend these power strips..."
3,Not ideal for home theatre,"From what I've read, flat panel TV's draw the most power in standby mode. Using the Smart Strip for my home theater, it's only logical to plug the TV into the control outlet so all components come on when the TV is powered up. Using this configuration the biggest energy vampire is still always on."
1,Power Strip,"The manual is not clear as to how to use this strip. All items plugged into this strip are ran by the main item plugged into the blue plug (control plug). Another words, if you have your TV plugged into the control plug, and then you plug in a stereo system, VCR, converter box, lamps, etc. into the other outlets, when you turn the TV on, EVERYTHING comes on. You cannot turn just the lamp on. If you don't have something plugged into the control plug, nothing will come on at all."
2,Great for One Song,"I purchased this album for the ""My-ya a Hee"" song and am glad that I did. However, the rest of the music is not up to that standard."
3,Doctor Who goes 1950s sci-fi movie,"This book was filled with the clichés of a 1950s American B-grade sci-fi movie, which to me made it rather at odds with the general feel of the Doctor Who series.The TARDIS crew arrive in the city of Arkhaven on a world whose final days are approaching. They get caught up in the events, but not everything is at it seems...Possibly if the revelations of what is really going on were less unpleasant I might have enjoyed this book more. In general, I have enjoyed Christopher Bulis' Doctor Who novels and, while this one is well written, I just didn't like it. I'm not certain why. It may be nothing more than being too dark for my mood at the time.But I'm still giving it 3 stars, so I must have liked something!"
3,Not everything is as it appears in this adventure!,"The Doctor,Susan,Ian and Barbara land on a planet about to be destroyed by a moon orbiting the planet. The travellers get seperated and meet many people who live on this planet. There are many plot twists and turns!Nothing or nobody in this book is what they seem!The real villian even shocked me! The only problem I have is that none of the Tardis crew relationships are explored or expanded! Also in this book, Barbara get brainwashed and Susan gets to meet a clone of herself! If you like the first Doctor or any of his companions you'll might like this book! For book that is similar to this read the Tom Baker story""State of Decay"" if you can find it! Overall I enjoyed this book ,just it takes me a long time to read them! Please bring back more missing adventures of the first Doctor ,Ian,Barbara and Susan! Just remember when you start reading this book everything to not what it seems!"
4,Surprises Awaiting Every Page,"A little adventure never hurts, does it? Well, if the Doctor listened to Ian & Barbara's protests every time, there simply wouldn't be any stories to tell. In this futuristic world, nothing is as it seems. Its a world of social class clashes, giant snakes, and scientific wonders gone wrong. Christopher Bulis does a great job at keeping a surprise waiting on every page, but the surprises in this story just ended up being a bit far-fetched. Even for a time traveling sci-fi lover like myself. Overall while it was a interesting and enjoyable read, it simply was one I could put down for a few days & come back to finish it later. This book might not be the first one I'd point out to a new fan of Dr. Who, but at the same time, its certainly not one Dr. Who regular would want to miss out on."
4,The Constitution In Context,"The American colonies won independence from Britain a few years earlier. The thirteen states met to form a ""more perfect union."" No dictatorship, no monarchy, no theocracy. A distrust of centralized power, but how should power be allocated and disbursed among the states and the people?The authors concentrate on setting the stage of the Constitutional Convention and describing the foundational issues of government, the alliances and coalitions that lead to compromise and the personalities of these great men.It's frightening how far we have drifted from what these men intended and tried to guard against. Many of their fears are being realized today. I won't try to explain it here, but you'll understand after reading this sprightly, mostly objective account."
3,AP Government,"I am a student in AP Government and was required to read this book as a summer reading project. Overall it was not bad...interesting at times, but i found it repetitive and confusing. I would not recommend it unless you absolutely love history or really want to know what happened on those dreary days in Philadelphia."
3,One fell off immediately...,"My daughter loses earrings at an alarming rate. So I bought 2 pairs of these. Within 2 days she had lost one. I replaced it and now it has been about 4 months and no further loses.The earrings are nice, small, simple studs with the screwback."
4,Almost there ..... but not quite.,"Great guitar work, good tunes, decent vocals. What's the downside? Too much reliance on the synthesized rhythm section and keyboards. When you've got a great sound (and Cooling does) why smother it with electronics? Hire a few more studio side men and open up the sound. Mind you, I'm a big fan of what electronic instruments can do for jazz, especially ""smooth"" jazz, but on this CD the MIDI bass lines and keyboard fills really distract from the main event."
5,Highly Impressed,"What planet have I been on the last few years.I was just recently introduced to this work of art and I must say,this is guitar playing and scatting at its best. J. Cool gives Benson a run for his money.The melodies offer a soothing result when combined with smooth vocals. I consider myself a very hard critic on music,but this disc (artist) I am extremely impressed by.Your jazz collection won't be complete without it."
2,Great First Song but.....,"Wow, I was blown away by the first song,'Callie'. I have heard it on the radio and as usual, they rarely named the author after it was played. Thanks to the Wave's webmaster, I was able to finally find the song. Anyway, after listening to the samples, I was somewhat disappointed, considering how great the first song played. Perhaps, if I listened to the whole CD verses samples, my opinion will change. Does anyone know how I can get the first song and save myself 16 dollars :-)"
5,I use this for my ukulele,Perfect for setting up the ukulele. I use it on the underside of the nut or saddle or even to cut the notches deeper. Works great.
4,Bought For My Son,Bought this for my son for trick or treating this year. They did the trick! Fits well (my son is 10) and kept him warm.
2,Overpiced,"Good but seems to be overpriced to me, you get a good quality tea, very aromatic, but they want far to much for it."
4,Be advised of what you are getting,What I ordered was Celestial Seasonings Goji Berry Pomegranate Green Tea. What I received was Celestial Seasonings Pomegranate Green Tea. Celestial Seasonings has changed the formula by removing the Goji berrys. The online advertisements are misleading. I decided to keep the tea anyway although it is not as good.
4,very good item but not the package,"Generally this one is very good.But one fault happend in shipping. Find a hole on the back of the item. The seller refund some money for the fault promptly. The item is smartly handmade,and really an elegant one hanging on the wall in your home.One point I don't like: the front protector is acrylic instead of glass. I prefer glass to the plastic one.The acrylic is light yellow when you see it form side, and it is dim when it is face to the sunlight, not like glass that is clear and crystal.The frame is high quality,elegant and well technics."
4,Jointed is the way to go....,"I have to say the only drawback is the size... this thing is a bit small and the hooks are rather small as well. That said, this thing has some wicked action in the water as do most Rapala jointed baits."
3,Ford Step Bumper,"Item made of a lower gauge metal, so it could be damaged in shipping, in fact mine was but it was such a good price I just beat it with a mallot to straighten it back out. Product just fine for the money, a very good deal."
2,Very dissapointed!!!,"To say i'm dissapointed with this CD is an understatement! When I first opened it I had my doubts as there were no production dates with the credits and of course my suspicions deepened when I listened to it!Yes that's right, a lot of these are re-recordings! A tiny note on the reverse says * denotes 'new digital recording'! This applies to several of the tracks and these new recordings are far inferior to the originals. As for the rest, I have my doubts, although many are little known Euro hits and i'm no expert in that field! I thought Disky, with their fine Millenium collection could have done better than this and I guess the same will apply to the others in this series. So beware, if it's originals you are after, then avoid this one!"
1,AWFUL,"Even if you LOVE these singers, stay away from this CD. Some of the songs are not the original recordings and the one that are were pulled from terrible tapes and poorly mixed. However, it will make a good trash can filler."
1,Not the Original Recording,"You Belong to Me by Jo Stafford had one of the best ""first notes"" of any song ever! It's a tragedy that this original recording has been tampered with & ""redigitalized"" or whatever they call it. Never try to fix something that was perfect. The big question is how can we acquire the original version?"
1,A HUGE Disappointment,"This book is a jumbled, disorganized, mess. And to top it off, it displays an incredible number of historical flaws, particularly in regards to the Romans. The author appears to try his hardest to denigrate the Romans at the expenses of the Celts and seems to assume that his readers haven't bothered to read Livy, Polybius, Appian, Plutarch, Caesar, or other ancient writers.I'm not a big admirer of Caesar and the Romans; however, I believe history should be presented in an honest and objective manner. This book did neither.In my opinion, the book was a waste. Other writers have done a much better job of presenting the world of the Celts. Save your money."
3,If you are Irish you'll love this book.,"[...]As a professional writer I found the book to be rather redundant, with the author returning to scenes and repeating facts that had already been covered more than once. Because he is a documentary film maker, and a good one, that may be the cause of that. Repeating scenes can be an effective visual device, but it is distracting in a book. However, the early history of the Celts and their widely established culture, covering most of modern Europe, was a real eye-opener for me. But, as I intimate in the title of the review, the last half of the book concentrates on the history of the Celts in the modern British Isles, though that history is well-covered. But a comprehensive history of the Celts would need a book five times the size of this one to do it justice. But this book is a good place to start from."
3,HMMM......,This album is definetly dark and different. Some of the songs are amazing and wiked beats. The thing that turned me off this album a little was the rapping and the content of the rapping gets really tired quick. The beats in the back are almost insulted by the rapping.I still recomend it but Signify is definetly more talented then this album. I expect better on the next release.
4,4.5 - Signify should not be slept on any more,"Dj Signify comes very correct on this solo excursion. The content is very solemn and brooding, and both guest emcees Buck 65, and Sage Francis contribute some of their best abstract work. Notable tracks are ""Winters Going"", ""Haunted House Party"" and ""Cup of Regret"". The samples Signify employs are very obscure and some are haunting indeed.He juggles a comedian (who sounds very amateruish) with organs, bells and whistles on one track, in contrast with several others which are bass ridden and downright spooky. I disagree with the reviewer who states that the emcees detract from Signify's music. Somehow he manages to meld the material in a way that is edifying for both Buck 65 and Sage. The only weak tracks are ""Peekaboo pts 1 and 2"" they simply don't belong anywhere on this album, and stick out badly.Signify is a wicked dj and producer...this release is a definite head nodder, some of the beats are just superb."
2,AMATEURISH BOOK,"I really grew to dislike Tess. She is bossy and a know it all. She is constantly talking down to Dane and is very disrespectful. I don't know too many men who would tolerate her mouthiness, especially a Captain in the 18th century. The ending was terrible. And, of course, Tess comes across, at all times, smelling like a rose. Everyone loves her. Why? I can only see this book appealing to a 16 year old girl with no experience in life whatsoever. This author's writing is a bore. The book only got worse with continued reading."
5,Read this - then buy the drive.,"Ok let me make this dead simple. Decision made - this is the drive you need to buy ..it's as simple as that - you can stop searching now. Here's why:* It's fast. Very VERY fast* It's power consumption is ridiculously low - your laptop battery life will remain almost totally unaffected* It has seductive looks and will blend in with any computer PC/Mac alike* The price is great and you will be left feeling you've come up trumpsNo, I don't work for Segate. But what I can tell you is I went to Fry's to buy a drive out of necessity and after weighing up all the available options plumed for this one. The next day I was so unequivocally impressed I went back to buy a second and feel strongly enough to sit here in a hotel lobby writing this review for you.Nuff said."
3,Last About 1 Year then Croaks,This Hard Drive is good for a short time but it goes through a break down after a certain amount of space is used
1,Buyer beware!,"I'd bought my original drive almost a year ago. The first one died in early June and I contacted Seagate, sent it back at my own expense and then I received a refurbished drive that won't write more than 3GB worth of data before it freezes up and causes my system to crash. I call Seagate and the less than helpful tech in India offers me the same deal as before. Why would I want another P.O.S. refurbished drive at $20+ in s&h? Poor product and equally shabby customer service, I'll be buying my products from one of this company's competitors from now on."
1,Not recommended,"I've been using the drive for about 1 year and I accidentally hit the power switch. After that, the drive doesn't work anymore. It just makes a beeping sound and Windows XP can't find the hardware. This is not a robust drive."
1,Don't purchase,"I had a similar experience to R. Ail. My ST9100801U2-RK died quite unexpectedly after just over a year of use, and Seagate's customer service was much less than helpful; their rep actually got wise with me when I asked why I should buy another Seagate; ""You never know, you might get lucky this time"" I was told. Fortunately a repair guy I know was able to save the data, and repair the disc, although of course the case is shot. I need another portable drive, but it won't be a Seagate!"
1,Not Compatible!,"I was hoping, and was led to believe by the listing, that this item could be used with a MAC and a PC. THIS IS NOT THE CASE! In fact, Seagate does not recommend transferring information between a Mac and a PC using this hard drive. Unfortunately, I found this very important information on the third page of the user's guide. Very disappointing."
1,"Worked for 2 months, then died","Was an excellent drive for a very short period of time. Then it just died suddenly, with 50 GB of critical data on it. Now Seagate wants anywhere from $1000-2500 to get the data off of a $200 drive. I've owned over a dozen external HD's, and have never had one fail, certainly not after 2 months. Seagate's customer service leaves much to be desired, they're not helpful and run around circles within their own policy.My advice, stay away from this Seagate drive."
4,Couldn't ask for more,"This little HDD does everything I expected in a quiet and reliable manner. I have backed up every file I have on my home computer onto it and while reinstalling my OS on that (for the first time ever, a nerve-wracking experience), the Seagate drive didn't miss a beat and restored everything perfectly. After a nasty experience with an Iomega 160 GB HDD, this is a great relief.The ONLY reasons I have not given it five stars are that I have only owned it for just over a month so cannot vouch for its longevity and that I guess it could be cheaper.Overall, though, I am completely satisfied with it so far."
1,Avoid,"The drive is adequate, it has conked out a few times, but generally comes back, BUT it takes a wierd y-shaped cable which requires TWO USB ports. My cable stopped working, and ordinary USB cables DO NOT WORK, despite what a lengthy process through customer service tell you. Then, to order a replacement cable, multiple calls on hold eventually takes you to a service center in some remote countyr where the operators barely speak english. After repeating all my contact and drive serial number etc info for the fourth or fifth time to a foreign speaking customer service person (and this after being on hold for nearly an hour), I have yet to hear back about getting a new cable.AVOID!!!"
1,Not recognized by computer,"I just got this home and plugged it in, but my computer doesn't recognize it. I'm running Windows XP so it shouldn't be a problem. The disk that arrived with the drive has no drivers, so no luck there. I think I'll be returning this one."
3,Super Slim Zoom Drive from DES System is your answer,"To deal with the concerns mentioned by the pevious two reviewers, please try the following product which I gave a ""5 star""Zoom Drive 100GB High Capacity Super Slim Drop Resistance Mobile External Data Storage System with USB 2.0 Interface.I have two Zoom Drives (40GB and 80GB) before they made the 100GB one this May. Since then, I have bought 4 of the 100GB one for my friends to share my audio files with them. We all love them. No problem at all. Quiet, quick, and power adapter free (though they do provide you one and a genuine leather case in the package). It's only 6 oz. You'll love it."
1,Won't work at all. First Seagate Turkey I have ever seen.,"Won't even show up on Windows Explorer. Add Hardware can't find it. Does not show up as USB device or disk drive. Should come with power supply. (YES, the blue light comes on fine. Appears to haver power. It hums!)Dave B from MIT"
5,"Fast, Reliable, and Simple","This product is great! Before I got this HD, I tried building my own external HD, with a 2.5"" HD and an external enclosure. The one I built was physically smaller than the Seagate; however, it got really hot, really fast. The Seagate Portal HD does not get hot; it dissipates heat very well, thanks to the aluminum enclosure. Set-up was simple. I simply plugged the included cable to a USB port, and XP had no problems detecting it. When there's disk activity, a blue LED lights up in the front, which to me is a nice touch. My only complaint is that I wish Seagate included some type of a carrying case for the drive and the cable. Overall, I highly recommend this product."
2,Seagate 100 GB Drive,"If you are looking to back up files such as pictures and videos and know little about computers, this item is not for you. This product is not formatted for the above-mentioned files. Although this device can be reformatted to backup such files, it is a difficult task. I spent over a hour trying to read through the manual on how to reformat the drive, but was unsuccessful. The manual was of no help as it gave no step by step instructions on how to reformat."
2,The cord is pulling loose,"I was initially happy with the unit. It seemed to charge well, and I liked that its cord is less bulky the Motorola's. But... the cord is not well glued into the strain-relief at the car-plug end. The cord is pulling out and exposing the inner wires. I'm afraid it is only a matter of time until the wires break inside."
2,Disappointing Read,"This was my first Mary Daheim book, I picked it up on a whim.I was disappointed in the book, in no small part because of the unlikeable characters. After about a quarter of the book was behind me I found myself wondering why I should continue, because the heroines were just as cranky as the supporting cast, and even the cruise ship setting, which had some great promise, lacked sparkle.Unless you have an interest in reading everything in this particular series, I'd devote my time elsewhere."
3,Guys and Dames,"On a cruise that is not to be, Renie and Judith find, of course, a corpse. The theme of the cruise is 1930's and once everyone disembarks into the wonderful city of San Francisco ( which is well drawn)it seems the theme continues ashore. Part of the mystery is for the reader to discern who the characters represent from past famous mysteries. At times enjoyable, frivolous and - tedious."
1,Stick a Fork In It,"I've read this series since the first installment, and unfortunately they keep getting worse.Renie, who used to be somewhat amusing, keeps getting more and more annoying. Way too much time is spent on stupidity such as her stuffed ape being ""kidnapped"" and her rabbit dressed in a tutu. Her mouthiness and attitude are also no longer entertaining -- the character has become unbearable. And Judith isn't much better -- people talking to her because she smiles warmly at them has long since gotten ridiculous.When you run out of feasible reasons for your characters to be involved in murder and the reasons become as convoluted and lame as they have with this series, it's time to stick a fork in it."
2,Dead Man Docking,"Well, this was a mystery I had a hard time reading. Hey, I've had 2 hip replacements! What's with this woman detective? So she's had one. Must have gone to the wrong orthopedist. Slowwwww, I've read much better. And I am always combing through Amazon for much better reading than this mystery."
4,Dolce Triade,"After listening to this album, I'm a Dolce Triade fan! I must however admit that the first album eclipses the second, so if you're on a tight budget, stick with the first album."
3,"Good support, runs small, Marks on my shoulders",I just put this bra on for 30 minutes and I already have marks on my shoulders. I have to say this runs small. I usually wear 34-36 C and the Medium size bra says it's a 34. The straps are thin so they do dig into your shoulders. This bra is going back.
4,COMFY - GREAT FIT,"My daughter has just turned 11 years old, these are her second set of bra's that I have brought for her (I brought 2 white and 1 beige). The other set were much cheaper but the straps kept on falling off her shoulders. She loves how comfy,great fitting - and the straps don't fall off."
3,"Ok, but not quite there","I was hoping for a comfortable bra, and while this one is ok, it's not quite there yet. Needs just a little bit more coverage and wider shoulder straps (they kind of dig in). I was hopeful, but the search continues."
2,Improper fit,"This runs really small. I bought another style by the same maker in the same size, and it fit perfectly. This style is wonky."
1,Horrible fit!,This bralette runs small in the inches size and was very tight.I am really disappointed in the fit of this bra. There is no way this was an XL...
1,I could have thought of these without the book,"The topics that this book suggests are not very good for most writers. I teach high school, and have my students write daily. These topics leave little room for creativity, and many can be answered with just a few words, and are difficult for students to expand on. I have better luck making up my own topics. I was dissapointed with this book, because I have read similar books, ""book of questions,"" which are much better."
2,Following Steve Reich,"This is a very well performed CD of minimalist music, much of which seems clearly influenced by Steve Reich. (The above reviewer who said this CD is reminiscent of Morton Feldman is mistaken. Only the CD's final track -- the most interesting and rewarding track on the CD -- sounds like Feldman.) If you just can't get enough of Steve Reich and his imitators, and if you want to hear good old-fashioned pulsating minimalism watered down by yet another young second generation minimalist, you will probably enjoy this CD."
3,Smaller Than I Thought,"Product is smaller than I imagined, and made of hard plastic. However, it does does work for what I wanted it for."
4,Page up,"These things are great, they don't take up much space and are fun to look at. Highly recommend all my co-workers and I have them."
2,SUPER CUTE BUT........,I loved having this on my desk till it started to leak. The liquid completely drained out within 8 months of owning it. My assistant bought me another one and the second one did the same thing.
5,Great!,Just what I needed! I use this when I travel to hold my papers and it is excellant. Perfect travel size.
4,one problem,This thermometer works and is easy to clean but the design makes the upper half top-heavy so it rotates around upside down . Sort of a problem to read until you turn it back around.
3,"It gets the job done, but it's a little sluggish.","The design is nice and it's easy to read. It also appears to be well-built and durable. The only gripe I have is that it can take 10 seconds or more for the needle to begin to rise. I don't know if it's a defect or that's how it normally functions but it's a bit irritating.It's also a bit overpriced.It's fine, but you should be aware of that before you buy one.Edit: I'm retarded, it takes awhile to register because it's building up to a temperature that it will display. Me = dumb."
1,Waste of money,"I was trying to use it to cook rib eye. When after 8 min of cooking thermometer was showing only 130F/55C while i've started to have some doubts. I've checked the meat and it was already ""well done"".Then I've checked temperature of bowling water, to be sure if it shows wrong temperature - it shows only 170F/77C, which is completely wrong I believe.My conclusion: this thing is 100% waste of money, which can't be used in a cooking."
1,SHATTERED IN MY OVEN - GLASS IN MY FOOD,"I purchased this after reading the positive reviews in Jan. of 2012. I have had it for 4 months and have used it probably 10 times. Up until today it worked as advertised.Last Sunday I was preparing a large pork roast and I heard a loud pop out of the oven about 20 minutes before the roast was to be complete. I opened the door and noticed that the meat thermometer had SHATTERED in my roast in the oven. Glass was everywhere. On my roast, in the pan, in the bottom of my oven. I was so disappointed in the product. First of it ruined my $15 dinner. Second of all a meat thermometer should be designed and tested to operate in the conditions that occur in the oven. Not operating properly is one thing; shattering glass in the oven is yet another.DO NOT BUY this product.I was even more disappointed when I was unable to return the product so I decided to write this review to keep others from losing their money on an UNSAFE product."
1,Broke after 2 uses,I think teh title says it all...I used it twice and then it stopped working. I emailed Polder customer service and they never replied. Stay away
1,Polder 12454 Meat Thermometer,"This thing lasted about two months, if that. I used it less than 5 times before it quit working. Would never buy again."
2,a waste of time,"Interesting story that could have been told in 20 pages, but this author chose to stretch her meager research into 300 plus looong pages. Watch an episode of Snapped online or read only if really interested in the case. I guess when you start with Ann Rule, everyone has big shoes to fill."
5,Fun!,"Horror fun with lots of twists. Each time new characters are introduced, you can feel their connection to each other. I didn't want to end, but so badly wanted to know the ending. The format was strange, with the margin being on the right, but that may have been my Kindle. Sad that this is Mike's last adult fiction. Would like to see more by him."
4,Great read,A very quick read and there were no parts that I felt were boring and should have just been left out. A good read for true crime fans.
4,The investigation and capture of one of the most vicious murderers of modern times,"This is a fascinating detective story that happens to be true. It would be hard to write a dull book about Andrei Chikatilo, but the way the author drew his characters really gripped me -- as did his horrific examples of the corruption and incompetence within the Soviet criminal justice system, which among other things lead an innocent man to be convicted of one of Chikatilo's murders and executed.A word of warning: the book is as much about Inspector Kostoev (who was in charge of the task force to find Chikatilo and who eventually wrung a confession out of him) as it is about Chikatilo and his crimes. It goes into great detail about Kostoev's background, childhood, etc. I found it all very interesting but others may just want to read about the murders. Most of the Kostoev biography can be skipped if you really don't want to read it."
5,Hunting the devil,This book arrived promptly and in good condition. I've not yet read it.I'm extremely pleased with both the vendor and the product.Dr. John E. Touchton Sr.
4,"""BIBLE"" FOR THE ACTOR","I studied with Michael Shurtleff in the late 80s; we used his 12 Guideposts as the basis for the work we did onstage. Everything he taught in person is in this book - truly the how-to steps in enriching any seasoned actor's performance, as well as a what-to-do for the beginner. It's hands on, down to earth, and on the money, all stemming from the first guidepost: finding, exploring and using relationship. Relationship in this case means the connecting emotional life that exists, or should exist, between you and the other characters in the play. Vital stuff in easy, entertaining prose. (I would have given it 5 stars, but I'm sensitive to the edgy material included.)"
5,It works. It creates actors. It simply works.,"I had no acting experience. None. Not even in school plays.I got into acting on a lark, as a hobby. I had been studying and auditioning for about three years with no success, and very little progress.An instructor recommended this book. I read it, and then read it again. All of a sudden, things that had been drilled in my head during acting classes finally started to make sense. Within the following 6 months, my skills grew in a series of leaps, and I began booking at auditions. Not a lot, not yet. But the sudden increase in my abilities was astounding.I am still not a great actor. But this book helped me get out of the ""student"" mode and into the ""working"" mode. Well worth it."
5,I've nearly worn my copy out with use!,"This book is an INVALUABLE resource. And I'm not a traditional actor, I'm an opera singer. I had to read this for a class on (what else?) auditioning, and loved it so much that I finished it the first day of class. Shurtleff's 12 Guideposts, carefully applied to just about any performance (I use them for arias, art songs, etc), can help create something nuanced and fascinating. As if the guideposts weren't enough, Shurtleff gives wonderful ideas on the nitty-gritty of auditions (how to present your past experience, what to wear, etc). I just can't say enough good about this book. When I perform an operatic scene that I've run through the 12 guideposts, I get comments like, ""You're a great actress! You really have a theatrical flair!"" Boy, does that feel good. I'd give this thing six stars if I could. I hate to even tell other people about this book, because then everyone can gain my edge."
5,right on the money!!!!,"This book will not only give you the insight and the know-how on how to get it together, but it's chock full of humorous anecdotes and phrases. The great thing is that not only can you use these techiniques towards acting, but they also work EXTREMELY well for job interviews and life as a general rule. It is more of a Real Life 101 and how to deal with directors (i.e bosses, teachers) It serves a multi-faceted purpose. Every actor/actress should own two copies (in case somebody steals one)."
2,C'monnn,"This book is easy to read and potentially helpful, but it only really needs to be 2 pages long. It is literally a bunch of name-dropping and rambling. I found myself being more annoyed by the auther than learning anything. Half the book is just his examples that really don't need to be there- he just want us to know he is amazing and is such a good actor/coach."
3,"Not quite everything you need, but maybe something you're missing.","If you were looking for a book that could solve all your worries and questions regarding auditioning, this isn't it. But go ahead and pick it up anyway. I can assure you that it will have something good for you to glean from it. However, I do feel it could be about half the size it is, as it is very repetitive, but all the same, it does offer a unique perspective on the problems of the audition. Mind you, I don't agree with everything said in this book, but I guarantee it will help you in some way."
5,"A must-read for every actor, director, or casting director","Just as valuable as Stanislavski's ""An Actor Prepares."""
5,One of the Top Ten Audition Books,Acting and getting work as an actor are two completetly different things. You want to learn how to audition? Start with this book.
4,What are you fighting For?,The first raw book I was exposed to as a student in a casting director's audition class years ago. You have to read it more than once with a notepad and copies of the movies Shurtleff quoted when using their scripts. The coach breathed this text and eventually so did we. It doesnt matter if you are theater or film actors. This is old school no holds barred text. Memorize those rules for cold readings! They work enough to get you considered for the part.
4,Wow! I'm so glad I have it.,I don't like to read normally. I am passionnate about acting and I decided to expend my knowledge with this book suggested by this overall review. I love it!!! It was hard for me to put the book down when I had to. This book will make you a better actor and will definitely help you to be prepared for your auditions
4,"Would Have Been 5 Stars, but...","The only reason I did not rate this book at 5 stars is that I purchased a very similar book (which I did rate 5 stars) along with this one. The other book, ""The Cook's Illustrated Guide to Grilling and Barbeque: A Practical Guide for the Outdoor Cook,"" was copyrighted in 2005, whereas this book was copyrighted in 2001. I expected the two books to be somewhat different, but the 2005 book appears to me to be an updated and revised version of this book. Both books are excellent, but I have found nothing in this book that the 2005 book doesn't contain. And, as you would expect, the 2005 book has more pages, more recipes, and more instructions and information than this 2001 edition.I have rated the 2005 ""Illustrated Guide..."" so I'll not repeat that here. I see no reason to purchase this 2001 book, so long as the 2005 ""Illustrated Guide"" is available."
5,"If you love hot chocolate, buy this book",This is a great recipe book for anyone who loves hot chocolate. Beautiful illustrations. Would make a wonderful 'stocking stuffer' at holiday time.
1,Undrinkable - but you could eat it. Maybe...,"We tried the most basic recipe in this book as a special treat over the Christmas holidays. I'm sorry to say, that while we were looking forward to rich cups of chocolate (our first love), we didn't have cups of steaming ganache in mind. Make no mistake, you'd better be really into chocolate to buy this book. We thought we were, but two melted Lindt bars later (that's for 2.5 cups of chocolate), we quickly learned there IS such a thing as too much chocolate."
1,Not in the advertised box pictured!,"Be aware this listing is for the CDs in the paper envelopes, Do not recommend as they will have no protection when shipped. I reecommend the Boxed version of this software title includes a manual and registration cards and the box protects the contents very well. This way of selling software in a paper like envelope maybe cheaper but lacking manuals literature and protection is like taking a chance on the postal service handling of your paper thingy envelopes. Get the boxed version if you want to get your product safely."
5,great for plastic welding,worked great on a non milwaukee heat gun. used for hdpe welding. This concentrates the heat to a spot and was able to melt the plastic with ease.
4,Great but resource hungry,"The latest JBuilder from Borland Has been one of the best in the industry. But a word of caution-It takes huge memory to execute and is recommended only for higher end computers. Even hi-power servers(on intranet) may perform poorly in the execution of the program. But yet fairly a nice one-if you are not going to compromise for memory. Anyway, the product is simply great!"
2,Weather Awareness not worth the money,"While having the current weather available at all times via the Internet is handy, as a subscriber to Weather Bug Pro for one year, it has been more hassle than it's worth.In the past 12 months, I've needed technical support at least 15 to 17 times. Never once did I receive the appropriate answers/actions needed to correct any of the various problems that occurred with Weather Bug Pro. In fact, I never received any personal assistance at any time - only a computer generated: ""Try this ..."" response. I would end up having to uninstall and reinstalling the program every time.There are free weather services available via the Internet which will give you what you need: the forecast.Save your money."
4,Whether you should buy this for the weather?,"While I must acknowledge the radar presentation needs some improvement, I really like this product. It is so convenient having the current temperature displayed in my system tray at all times. Detailed information for your home location (and for any selectable station as well) is only a click away. The key feature making this product useful is the instantaneous alert for hazardous weather. Once the weather service enters an alert/warning, WeatherBug starts chirping. This has obvious benefits from changing your commute time/route for the day or, in severe cases, taking protective measures before the weather becomes life threatening. It is well worth the small investment.The photos and video sections are a great way to entertain yourself."
5,Weather without all those car commercials.,"You want the weather forecast so you turn on the TV. You get two stories about Michael Jackson, and then the weather looks serious ... after these four car commercials.Bah! Hook up with WeatherBug Plus and you'll get weather: Pure, accurate observations from nearby, radar pictures, weather cams, and so much more. And if you're really into the weather, you can become a part of the network with a modest investment in your own instruments.Whether you're just wondering how to dress the kids in the morning, or you want to second guess the TV weathercasters, the Bug is your best friend -- a bug every computer should come down with!"
5,Best Home 'weather station',"WeatherBug Plus has met all my expectations which were high. I am sure one gets the best response using this over a high speed connection.It allows me to get immediate weather alerts (you can choose which ones you want to get), look up the forecasts in other cities and personalize my WeatherBug with a 'skin' (mine is cats).I can see weather related photos others have submitted, up to date radar 'pictures' as well as local camera views, and traffic info. Recently the Storm Central tab has been great!I am not even sure I have tried out all the ways I could customize my WeatherBug but I will try them all!"
1,:Loaded with Spyware..,"If this is the same program that numerous TV stations have been using to distribute to their viewers, then I would have to stay away as the previous versions were loaded with spyware and by some strange method, junk mail would go through the roof. If this is the same program, stay away. Go to the weather channel instead for free!"
2,too much -- takes over,"Weatherbug used to be handy, With the latest incarnation, v. 6, it takes over the screen and provides way too much information -- so much stuff going on at once you don't really see anything. No more at-at-glance stuff. The radar lags way behind. It's much more difficult to use than it used to be. You're better of just getting a weather sticker for your desktop by going to www dot wunderground dot com -- which you can view adv. free for just $5 per year."
3,Good Product / Bad Practices (spyware),"I tried it, I BoughtIt because the software is a 5 and I wanted to get rid of the banner adds. This worked great. However with the latest Upgrade I'm getting unwanted e-mail advertising and each time I turn on my machine I'm getting Weatherbug Spyware. While I don't believe the spyware is harmful It is an unwanted annoyance and it is spying. Thus the 3 rating"
5,Wow,"I am truly impressed with this new weather bug plus. I love how easy it is to get to where you want, the traffic is awsome and the storm watch is a ""must see"" you can watch any storm that is going on, feels like you are there with the people reporting or sharing their pic's that they have taken. I have family through out the U.S. so this has eased my mind when I could go right there and see for myself that they are ok.Thank You for all of your hard work this could not have been easy to do."
4,good product,"I am very happy with this case. It is just what I wanted, and is durable, lightweight, and protects my ipod very well at the same time. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a case to protect their iPod investment but does not want a big, bulky, leather case to do so."
5,Amazing !,"This book is incredible ! Not like non-fiction at all. I can't believe that this is a real person. Who could do things like that. She would be believable as an X-files character. The book is well writen, great language for that kind of publication. As soon as I finished it, I began to read it again. Books like that are important to open our eyes on the kind of justice we have. Is it possible that she will be free eventually? This is scary."
3,Karla,I have read most of the bio's on Karla and her seriously mentally ill husband and this book really covered more than i wanted to know. Probably great reading for a shrink.
2,Karla: A Pact with the Devil,"Didn't care for this follow up book to his ""Invisible Darkness"" because basically all he did was reiterate what he stated in that book. There wasn't really anything new other than the letter Karla sent to him, which wasn't very interesting."
4,A good book for EMC studying.,A very useful book for me to study electromagnetic compatibility .I hope I could have one.
4,"Here is an alternative to ""Deep Forest""","Simon Hulbert has created, produced and performed a very good CD in the vein of Deep Forest. There are not many artists who compare so well. Dance beats underlie infectious melodies and ethnic voice samples.Two years (2002) after the CD release (2000) and four years (1998) after copyright, I am writing the first review on Amazon and there are no track listings or samples provided on the page. That is a extreme shame because I have bought other ""5 star"" buyer rated attempts at ""dance world"" music and been very disappointed. I am tempted to award a 5 star rating for that reason but I reserve that rating for ""classic"" CDs.According to the insert, ""Chorus Of Tribes"" is not the artist name but refers to the style of music. My rating of 4 means I like the album, still listen to it and recommend a purchase."
2,Better than nothing.,"The best part about this shop manual is the chart that tells you what the fluid capacities are. I've been an Automotive Technician for over 15 years and mostly working on BMW's with four wheels. I've been lucky in that Bently Publishers make THE best shop manual outside of the factory for automobiles but unlucky that I had to settle for a Haynes for my Beemer. Lastly, of the three different items I ordered from Amazon on the same day, one of which came from the other side of the world, this was at my door a week later. While redrev did get it to me within the estimated delivery time, I don't know what the wait was for."
5,"Now, I know what I didn't know. Let the dealer do the job!","Well after getting the book, I looked up ""How to change the Clutch""..This is too much for me. You need special tools and precise handling. I have the parts(OME), but the labor has to be done by someone skilled in this operation. Believe me, the book is worthwhile."
2,clutered.,No a very good choice. The book is clutered with many differnt models. Hard to find anything. Would not recommend it.
5,Bully? or are you?,"Bully is awsome! You would definitly like this game now this is my brothers review: As for playing the game you'll find that, even though this is the school ground re-make of GTA: San Andreas, you'll find you'll be .1 Subjected to having not as much freedom to beat up authority as San Andreas. .2 Have to go too class (that is if you can aviod authority with out being caught for tyrancy) Like 2x a day. On the plus side: .1 Passing classes such as, let's say... Art will give you the ability to make-out with girls and get health for it. But anyway, joining a ""clique"" such as the jocks, Nerds, or the Greasers is REEAAALLLYY hard! You'll find that almost every mission involves Quote: HELPING THE NERDS. So you can't Excactlly become a Jock or a greaser. But here's a hint: to get the girls keep on talking too 'Em TRUST ME!"
3,"Fun and entertaining, but a little too easy.","I enjoyed most aspects of this game and it quickly becaming addicting. There was great satisfaction is beating people up and plenty of opportunity to fine tune my skills. Overall though, this game was definately on the easy side. Compared to the Grand Theft Auto games, of which I was never able to complete, I finished this one in just over a week. The final challenge was particularly simple and I really expected more. Still, I'd recommened this game, however rent it, don't buy."
5,"Totally Fun, brings back memories","The storyline kinda reminds me of high school in the early 90's. As a teen worried about popularity and standing up for yourself w/o worrying about fatal violence. Your the new kid trying to fit in and beating the clicks.The game play is really easy and I like the fact that time is a factor to determine gamplay. Also, THe seasons change and there are holidays in the game that affect the game Holloween and Xmas. It gives the game some variety and different experince. Cool weapons, like the sling shot, eggs and bottle rockets; things I use to use. There are also some extras like boxing matches, carnival games and shopping for outfits. Many mini challenges in the game.Humerious experince of what highschool life once was."
3,Surprisingly boring game,"I tend to love sandbox-games, especially from Rockstar, but this game is surprisingly boring. I think it's because it's rating ""T"" and doesn't do anything extreme or interesting, it's way too tame.If you are 10 years old it's probably awesome, but if you have been playing the GTA3 series since it came out, and have played games like Saints Row and love the grittiness of some of these more mature sandbox games, skip this, it will bore you."
4,"Nothing original in the gameplay, but a great game still","I really like this game, the story telling and the town you can explore (although I would have liked more added in the way of sandbox play), the game play is very similar to GTA, but the story is more intriguing, mainly because anyone who didn't think high school ""was the best time of my life"" can relate. Even after completing the story I had fun things to do but most of the game is in the missions, and I'm not able to waste hours having mindless fun the way I could in GTA never really achieving anything more then seeing what I could get away with.It gets props for bringing most of the fun of GTA into a less violent and more tongue-in-cheek environment. If someone wanted to get a game similar to GTA but without the brutal violence, this would be the game to recommend."
5,GTA in the school yard!,"Being a fan of the mindless violence and always questionable storyline of the GTA series, I had to pick up this game when I was browsing Amazon late one night. So much fun! If you're looking for something to kill time beating up people, it is definitely a little tougher than GTA because in this, on top of the story line, you have to go to class! Plus the farther you go in the game, the more you can unlock and the more fun you can really have. I'm only about 20% through the game and I've loved all of it so far! Definitely recommended for anybody with a sense of humor and a strict upbringing."
5,Bully Has Beaten Me Into Approval,"This game is a must buy. You have so much freedom, from starting food fights to giving kids swirlies it is a great game. You have classes and missions, a curfew, and you can get a skateboard, a bike, a go cart, or a moped. You have girlfriends, friends, and enemies.It's about a new kid at school who finds himself without any friends. Then Gary comes. He says that he wants to take over the school but he needs your help. Then he betrays you and it's a race to who takes the school over. This means you have to get the respect of six different groups. Preps, Nerds, Townies, Greasers, Bullies, and Jocks.This game is fun and you will be playing for hours!"
2,Game didn't last,"The game broke in less than one week, my son was so sad :( I didn't see a way to return it and not have to pay for it."
4,THIS GAME WAS FUN AND COOL,this game is good i played it over 10 hours and it was one of the best gamesthat i have so u should buy it. also this game takes place in high schooland it is like living back . just that rock star made it . it is like gta
4,Bully,"I really enjoyed this game. It has so many challenges and you can clock in many hours playing it until you have completed it 100%I also enjoy the free roam aspect of it. I like all the little side challenges. The only part I don't like is the bike racing parts. It is not because they aren't well done, It's because I'm just not very good at them.If you liked parts of Grand Theft Auto where the world is your oyster so to speak then I think you'll love this game."
4,required reading for anyone interested in erotic rope bondage,"I photograph and perform rope bondage and often I'm asked for advice on the subject and my immediate response is to buy this book. Jay is extremely experienced and delivers all pertinant information in a clear, concise manner.I own 2 copies because one of them is usually loaned out."
4,It's a good read,"It was with absolute excitement that I embarked on reading the book. Once I began reading it, I was hooked and devoured the entire book in a few days."
2,90% of what I got out of this coul dhave been taught in two chapters....,"I'm a novice, but this book was a bore. I expected more... I don't know, pictures, descriptions and more knowledge from a writter with suck skill in the craft. WHat I got was a lot of warnings and cautions (all of which were valid) but not much else to actually guide my learning except to advertise the need to join a group, meet with someone who knows more then me or find another resource that would actually teach something. Really disapointed."
2,Was not what I was expecting,"Although the book is well written, it was not what I was expecting. Being that it was an ""bondage handbook"" you would think it would have more than just a single diagram for different kinds of knots and ties. Nope. If you're looking for step by step instructions on ""how to"", this isn't the book. If you're looking to why one would do erotic bondage, than this book is for you."
2,if you really need a lecture,"I should be respectful to the work and safety consideration of the writer. This books talks a lot about what not to do when you are playing with bondages. This is good for those hardcore people who can possibly go out of control and hurt the partner. However, there is only about 15-20 pictures on this 300 pages of book. So, don't expect well detailed pictures and brief explanations. I have a busy life and a long-term partner. I was looking for a book that is easy to follow with many pictures and demonstration of variety of bondage styles. If you don't want to read a 300 pages of lecture about bondages I don't recommend this book."
1,Disappointment for advanced players,"Here is Jay Wiseman again in his usual, chatty, wordy style. If I were as impressed with Jay as he is, I would not have returned this book after reading only the opening parts. I know from his previous publications that his self-congratulatory writing style irks me, but I also know he has much experience in this topic, and that he brings the added perspective of an emergency medical technician. If ever there were a topic that would greatly benefit from extensive illustration, this is it. The illustrations in this book, as in his others, are few and lacking in detail. To learn complex tyings requires sequences of detailed pictures, and these are not here. One would ecpect to find the very interesting category of shibari, Japanese classical methods, but this is not covered.The veriest beginner could find this book useful, but the advanced person will not."
2,Not impressed...,"Very disappointed with this book. It's hard to know exactly how to tie the knot, if there isn't any illustration of how the knot should look. It was hard to know how to correctly do any of the knots or restraints. There was some good safety information in the book, but it was otherwise useless."
5,Simply the best bondage book out there.....,"Jay Wiseman is an extremely intelligent person when it comes to the artful, fantastic, and fun world of s&m. He has been in the scene for many years, and has experienced just about everything one can in the s&m world. I highly suggest reading his books if you are a first timer, somewhat new to the scene, or a seasoned veteran. If you ever have a chance to see his seminar in a town near to you, then you should feel priveleged to experience his wisdom in person and purchase more of his books."
2,I'll figure it out eventually....,"I found this book to be very informative about the ""ooh's and aah's"" of bondage, and a strong emphasis was placed on safety. But I was very disappointed in the lack of direction given. Being new to use of erotic bondage, I was looking for more how to and less conversation about the perks. The product description talked about the illustrations but failed to mention that they only show the end results and don't show the process of tying the knots. I guess it's up to me to figure it out for myself. I just hope the wife doesn't get too bored in the process."
5,Erotic Bondage Handbook,"Jay Wiseman writes with an ease of subject that transmits to the reader and practitioner. He explains in detail all the how's and why's to successfully begin exploring the world of erotic bondage. This is just one of his many well written books, all of which educate, entertain and take the mystery out of a taboo subject."
3,Helpful companion,"I have this book... on my wishlist. Based upon everyone's disappointment of lack of illustrations, I recommend a more comprehensive book to accompany this -The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Knots & Ropework. Much of what is illustrated in this book is completely applicable for any level bondage enthusiast and should fill in Wiseman's erroneous omissions."
2,Knot what you expected...,"With only a half dozen or so illustrations (and not a single photo), this book left a lot to be desired. For someone new to bondage and unfamiliar with knots, it's impractical to think they'll glean a lot from this book, before getting bored. The reading was dry, rambling, and repetitive... there are only so many ways to say ""Be careful!"" Take out half the pages, add photos (so a reader can see what they're trying to accomplish), and this book might have a chance."
2,not what I expected,"title says it all: i was expecting lots of pictures anf very few text. it turned out to be exactly the opposite, very much text and very few drawn images.I wouldn't recomend this book."
5,i love tbp,"The Berlin Project has come a long way and have put together an awesome cd. They are an incredible band, with alot of talent. Buy the cd you won't regret it."
4,Good if you know something about computers,"I like it. I'm no Rocket Scientist, but I set up peer to peer by myself. Once my contracted IT guy set up the system, I've had to use this book to guide me thru things (like a terminal server being upgraded from Server 2000, to Server 2003). MS sites are leading me to the place, but this book gives me the step by step. It's also helping me with permissions, and understanding how the system interacts."
3,Nice enough for the 30G but...,"...not great. It'll do the job, and covers my darling iPod well, keeps it accessible with all ports available without removing it from the case, but its drawbacks are cosmetic. It's leather-looking and all that, but it makes the sleek iPod look clunky. Fits the 30G snugly, but has lots of extra material around the edge of the case that really adds to its size. 3 stars only because the cosmetic look was important to me as well as functionality. The iPod is a sleek, well-crafted toy, and its case shouldn't detract from that."
1,Does Not Fit the 60GB with Video,"This is a nice case if you have a 30GB with video, BUT it doesn't fit the 60GB. Not even close. As a matter of fact the screen protector will tear if you try and put it in this case."
5,Breathtaking!,"Each turn of the page reveals another exceptional view. It's easy to take gorgeous landscape photos of New England in Autumn, but Richard Creek goes far beyond that. The lighting, cloud conditions, reflections, and seasonal conditions bring out the most in each photograph. I want to frame each one and hang it on my walls, or better still, visit each place and hope to see and capture a similar moment. I hope Mr. Creek follows up with a series of other states."
1,Old Product,"Well, I was wondering why I couldn't buy this product through Clinique and now I know. Clinique Self-Tanning Body Mist is an old product that I guess this vendor has gotten a hold of. The nozzle was clogged when I first tried to use it and brownish liquid came out, but I ran in under hot water and it cleared up, but it never really sprayed (or mist) out correctly...it kind of squirted. I used it twice already and it hasn't changed the color of my skin at all. I've moved onto Neutrogena Sunless Tanning Spray Micro Mist, which works a whole lot better."
5,Excellent Resource,"Written in a blessed spirit, Sauer provides a balanced perspective of God's workings in this world. His coverage of the second coming is especially good and provides substantive and not over-reaching answers to amillinialism. An excellent read."
4,book review,"Arrived quickly in condition advertised. Only read it briefly so far, but reflects content well worth the purchase and to be used as a future reference document."
5,great service,"The product arrive in time and in perfect shape, meet all my expectations. No problem at all, i recommend it"
1,Do We Really Care About This Heroine?,"Alison Kerry is our protagonist, and she makes her living as a courier hauling drugs and other contraband from one crook to the next. Her father is also in the drug business, as is his best buddy, and his girl friend.....etc. An honest guy sneaks into the book, but the author does him in quickly so that he doesn't make the other characters look too tawdry.So, what's our Key West, trailer trash heroine (with the attractive feminine nickname of ""Al"") up to? She's moving a computer disc with some Vietnam secrets from one bad guy to the next, and she runs into trouble. There are three ho hum action scenes in the book separated by great gobs of filler.I didn't care about any of the following elements of the book: the heroine; her friends; her family; the tedious, hackneyed Viet Nam atrocity plot; the soporific action scenes; or the writing. This, indeed, is one of those books that once you put it down, you will have trouble picking it up again."
3,Plot problems but potential,"Siler knows how to write and she knows how to turn the pages. I ripped through this book and really enjoyed it. However, I found the plot a bit hard to swallow at some points (why drive a computer disk across the country? and why wouldn't the cops have nabbed the heroine's powder blue Mustang if it was all over the news?). This novel is somewhat weak, but as a first novel it oozes with potential. I'm hoping that Siler will get better in her future offerings."
4,"It's A Cold, Hard World!","Drug running is big business in Florida. Mangroves in small bay inltets up and down the west coast of the state were made for midnight deliveries.Jenny Stiller takes the reader into the world of the drug runner. And, lest one get the impression that it's all excitement and glamour, this gripping novel gets it right. The days are endless, the friendships never truly exist and the life of a drug runner is one of constantly trying to survive only to run another load.The protaganist in this novel is a woman, Alison Kerry from Key West. Interestingly enough, though, the action begins in Seattle and runs throughout the heartland of America. Violence and suspense, combined with good character development and a very believeable plot make this one great novel."
1,The heroine should be in jail.,"In Jenny Siler's Easy Money, 1998, the ""heroine"" is a drug runner, and everyone around her is also involved with drugs. Siler is a good writer, and the dark, moody Key West setting is well done, but I'd have enjoyed the setting and the writing more if Easy Money had been a traditional good guy versus bad guy mystery, in which the detective or police round up all the Key West drug dealers, and put them in jail. I couldn't bring myself to care what happened to the ""heroine,"" or her associates.Pros: Good writing; good setting.Cons: The heroine is a drug courier."
1,who cares,in reading the back cover of this book i was prompted to purchase the book. mistake number one. mistake number two was actually finishing the book. i did not care about nor get a good feel for the charachters. as many words that were used to describe everything far too tediously in this book. i would've liked for the charachters to be more likeable. i personally did not care if the main character lived or died. far too much attention was given to the wrong details. i felt charachter development was shoddy. from the back cover of the book i thought it had potential. well that's seven bucks i won't get back.
5,A neglected aspect of Andean Culture,"This illuminating, well-researched book provides a look at a very important but neglected aspect of pre-Columbian Andean history. The re-tracing of ritual and pilgrimage in ancient times brings the reader into contact, with solid scientific basis, with native Andean spirituality, and gives essential insights into the rich and holistic Pre-Columbian Andean American Cosmo-vision. It also brings the Island of the Moon and its ancient sacred role out of undeserved obscurity."
5,Our grand daughter loved it!,We purchased this doll for our grand daughter who collects dolls. She loves it! Carry's it everywhere as though it were a real baby.Very life like and realistic. A good purchase.
5,Proof that great music is overlooked,"For anyone who produces or loves music, both know that great music goes unheard or unrecognized when budgets for publicity are not available. Such is the case with this disc. I heard TRANCEMISSION live in San Francisco aroun '94 or '95 and bought this CD in the wake. It's a synthesis of ECM sounds, Oregon, and even some Steve Roach, and oddly pop and accessible. Why it didn't get a wider audience... well, it's been a dark time until today, Jan. 20, 2009. Maybe that explains the last 10 years. Anyway, check these tracks out. If you like Oregon, Ralph Towner and that crowd, this will likely please you."
4,The Hat,"Love Jan Brett... This one actually has two stories going, one in the main pages and one in the insets along the side, then they come together in the end. Fabulous!"
3,Beautifully illustrated -,"The story in this book is sweet, with the faintest hint of a message hidden in there. For someone who often gets hung up on the words, I have to say I was a little dissapointed with this book, probably because I think it could have been so much more. The illustrations, however are absolutely wonderful. And for most young children, this book would probably be highly treasured if nothing more than for the pictures and the cute story line.~DeeDee Fox, Author and Illustrator, The Ruby Red Slippers"
3,Not as good as The Mitten,"Get The Mitten instead, if you don't own it yet. This one is a little on the tedious side. You can see exactly where it's going from the very beginning and it doesn't have the peek-a-boo/sneeze joke in it that my daughter loves so much in The Mitten. To be honest, this is one of those books we have in our bookcase for variety and one of those ones where I skip parts just to get to the end of it."
4,Sweet story for toddlers,"I was given this book as a gift for my baby when she was born. The story is sweet and the illustrations are very pretty, but I have not been able to get my baby to like the book yet. The illustrations are a little hard - some animals are very small and hard to make out due to the ""sketch like"" nature of the drawings. The hedgehog is a hard animal to use as a main character since it is not in the farm animal lexicon familiar to small children. I am sure my baby will like this book eventually, but even now at 14 months, it does not hold her attention and she wants to turn the pages much too quickly to get through all the conversation on each page.Update: My litle girl is now 20 months old and has really loved this book since she was about 17 months. She loves her Hedgie and asks for thos book often."
3,not as expected,"not as expected ... thought I was getting ""keytone"" - my fault. didn't read it right. by the way - did buy keytone locally and it didn't work .. at all"
3,Red Rasberry Leaves,Didn't see any results in taking this product. Although I may not have given the product a long enough time to show me results.
1,Only Raspberry,"You DO NOT Want BlendsMany raspberry ketone supplement makers are more or less combining a minimal amount of raspberry ketones into a blend with other antioxidant/weight loss powerhouses like green tea, acai, or african mango, along with loads of caffeine and other stimulants.You want at least 500mg of raspberry ketone per serving. And raspberry ketone should be the ONLY ingredient. This is the human equivalent to the mice study referenced earlier. 100 -200mg will not do anything for you."
2,gimmicky,"I don't know why, I usually don't buy into the hype, but even my trainer had suggested I try these. I was ok with giving it a shot since it comes across as natural. Well, the only difference I saw was the increased visits to the ladies room. Really NOT a good time. Thanks Dr. Oz, but No thanks!!"
4,"Nature's Way red raspberry leaves, 450 mg, 100 capsules",Trying to heal myself with natural remedies. This products works okay. I think I gave up on it too soon. I intend to start again because I am seeing some of the good effects now.
4,"AWESOME, but.........","I got this for my birthday and I was sooo happy! I loved the movie and I wanted the soundtrack soooo bad. I liked:- A whatever life-by hailey duff. She isn't as good as her sister Hilary, and her song is plain, but a good message 8/10-Good Like-Jesse McCartney is okay, I don't really like his music. but this song rox! 9/10-Over it-This was by Chelsea on that's so raven. It is good but in the song it says ""too much and not enough play"" sounds kind of werid. Has a good tune, but a wrong message 8/10Then it has jordan cahill songs which aren't very that good. IT is a awesome cd, but not the very best."
3,Pretty Good,"Most of the songs on this soundtrack sucked, but I loved the following:A Whatever Life (Haylie Duff) - Haylie Duff is much more talented than her sister, Hilary Duff. This song is not my favorite on the soundtrack, but it's still really good.Good Life (Jesse McCartney) - The lyrics don't really make sense, but it's a really upbeat song, and it's really fun to dance to. LOLStuck (Stacie Orrico) - The lyrics are good, and Stacie sings it pretty well, but it's not something I listen to a lot.Over It (Anneliese Van Der Pol) - My favorite song on the whole CD! Who knew Anneliese had such a good voice?!~**~Overall, I'd give this CD a B- The first 4 songs saved it, in my opinion. Buy it."
5,Great reference,"I had a copy of this book that I found at a thrift store and then I met a young woman at my church who wanted to learn to preserve food, but felt daunted by the prospect so I gave her my copy. I immediately went on line to find this one. I love all the clear information on how to preserve food in so many ways--definitely something every woman should have who loves to see the fruits of her labors on a shelf. :)"
1,not accurate should not be used,"I've been canning by water bath method for 30 years and not killed anyone in my family, infact the whole family canned by this method. I brought your book to bring myself up to date and tried some of your recipes and followed your timing and and all the foods went bad. This year I went back to the old book and so far everything is fine. I know some things have changed over time but find your book unreliable."
5,I like this book - Great Read,"I found a copy of this in my local library. It is a great read. Some information is dated, mostly tax info, but the basic principles are still intact.I am looking forward to other books by Mark Haroldsen."
1,ANOTHER WASTE OF PAPER FROM HAROLDSON,ANOTHER WASTE OF PAPER FROM HAROLDSON! THE GUY GOT RICH FROM TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE UNSUSPECTING....HIS COMPANY WAS EVEN SHUT DOWN BY THE FTC. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY.
4,A Great Travel Guide,"I walked in the footsteps of William Wallace and Robert the Bruce during my visit to Scotland in 1996. I sure wish I had David Ross's book at that time; I would have known of more places to visit. This is a fine book about the history of the Bruce and Scotland's war for independence written, not from a historian, but from a Scot himself.The book has maps pinpointing the areas discussed in the narrative as well as great illustrations of those places written.Wallace started the ball rolling for Scotland's independence, but the Bruce wrapped things up. Even if you don't visit Scotland this is a great book to add to your collection."
2,they should include a magnifying lens,"First of all, not sure why this book is ""not for tourists."" I guess the authors are trying to be flippant. But, the book is totally for tourists or locals. That said, the book is a convenient size for putting in a back pack or shoulder bag. But, the print is soooo small. The publishers should include a magnifying glass to help people to read this book. Also, the book has lots of restaurants and cafes and shops listed but no detail on prices, cuisine, quality. I don't recommend this book."
4,Thank you Twilight Zone Magazine,"I remember being in high school and having a subscription to Twilight Zone magazine. The issue came with the excerpt from Stinger and I decided to read it. I really liked it and decided that I MUST have the book. Well, when I found the book I looked through it and saw that it was over 500 pages! I had never tried anything that big before, but I bought it anyway. Overall, it is an excellent book, but I will admit that it lags a slight bit in the middle, but I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the science fiction of horror genres. Great book, great read."
3,Best bought used.,Gotta do a lot of skimming to get to the good stuff. The characters don't stand out and one doesn't care a lot about what happens to them.
3,Good but clearly an early work,"Before seeing this was available, I'd heard that McCammon had stopped reprints of this and a few other early works. While I disagree with that choice, I can understand where he's coming from. There are clearly sections here that are amateur hour- weak character development, bad dialogue. But from a readers perspective, all of that is fairly easily skipped over. A fast paced, fun action novel."
4,Ok,Okay with me. I always like a decent read. Love reading on the kindle. Thanks for the good recommends kindle.
3,A 1950s B-Movie in Novel Form,"I think Robert McCammon is one of the most underrated novelists out there, and I heartily recommend his novels SWANS' SONG and BOY'S LIFE. I also liked STINGER, but not as much as those two other books.STINGER has a plot like a 1950s B-movie: a monstrous alien invades a dying border town, and the locals have to unite to fight the threat. McCammon does a very good job creating a colorful cast of characters, but I found the cartoonish plot way too silly to believe. The second half of this book is mostly one action scene after another, and I must admit I found them rather tiresome after a while.STINGER is fine if you're looking for some light fun, but it doesn't reveal McCammon at his best. If you enjoyed this book, I recommend Dean Koontz's PHANTOMS, which takes a similar premise but makes it more exciting and believable."
2,Worst McCammon I've Read,"Wolf's Hour was great. Boys Life was mesmerizing. The Five was invigorating.Stinger...Stinger...Stinger...Not so much. The long-winded chapters at the beginning that painted a stereotypical portrait of a small town populated by a cast of characters out of central casting, centered around the arrival of a mysterious object from space felt like a forced bit of writing whose sole purpose was to educate the reader about who lived in the town and what the core personality of each person was. The story ends up not being told in a fluid manner, and instead of learning about each character through the story and their actions, we're given all their foibles ahead of time and therefore know how each person is going to react in times of trouble.This was poorly paced and a chore to get through."
5,Gripping! One of the best!,"I am a HUGE horror novel fan and I just had to place my input in for this book. I absolutely loved it! Stinger is one of my favorite books of all time. It had all of the right ingredients to make it a classic in the horror genre. The suspense in this story is what I remember most of all. I was literally gripping the pages because I did not want to let go! If you are contemplating reading this book, it is a must! I honestly don't understand any of the critisizm's that some of the readers have posted. I disagree with all. I thought the characters were all well developed and I did not think it dragged along in any places and the story line of the gang war was interesting and original. Well done!! Do yourself a favor and start this book today!"
5,"Fun, Interesting and full of suspense!",I had just finished this novel yesterday. It was a very fun and interesting novel! and wayyyyy scary! The novel is about an alien who takes over a girls body and the people of this small town find out that that is the least of the problems. I am a big fan of Mr. McCammon's novels. It's the third one that I have read and I am definetly going to read more.
3,Not Nearly As Good As Swan Song,"The only two books I've read by this author are this one and Swan Song. Swan Song is spectacular. Stinger almost doesn't seem to be written by the same author. Stinger seems shallow in comparison. This book seems to be written on the reading interest level of a pre-teen or young teen, not an adult. I'm 27, by the way. Robert focuses more on gore and ""slime"" than on actual horror in this book. Sorry, but gooey, smelly aliens don't make a novel good all by themselves! And the gang rivalry just comes across as being immature filler in my opinion. I'm going to try at least 2 more books by Robert McCammon before I give up on him as an author though!"
3,Entrepreneur's Manual Eval.,The book has proven quite useful for my needs on business startup. Looking forward to getting quite a bit more use out of my purchase and the cost was most satisfying. We thank you for the service extended and hope to fullfil other needs by way of this process. Respectfully!
2,Product does NOT include Partition Magic,"There is some confusion in the specification that indicates that Partition Magic is included but that is only on the PRO product, which is sold in ten-license packs. You MIGHT be able to get this as an individual CD. Ghost, included in Systemworks, does both image and partitioning. If you use this product be very cautious about automatic drive letter adjustments -- it's not 100% and definitely not foolproof, nor does the UNDO feature work very well. It does move whole applications easier than, say, cleansweep--but large aps and suites and copy-protected aps are definitely a caution."
3,Mahler's Second,I bought this on a whim after reading a review. The music is OK. The CD is in perfect shape and the service was pretty good: it arrived within a couple of weeks.
2,It works - if you put (too much) work into it,"I live within 7 miles of the transmitter, with a hill and many buildings in-between. I've tuned in most available channels, but only by carefully moving the antenna (often into awkward positions) nearly every time I change channels. Simply, it takes too much effort. I'll try a signal booster or different antenna before I give up and go to cable."
5,excellent salsa crossover from spanish to english,I loved it... Can't wait until the whole album goes on sale... I will definitely buy the cd single until the whole album does... Love Marc Anthony... he is the greatest...
5,MOVE OVER RICKY MARTIN,"I am so glad that the whole world is going to finally get the pleasure of enjoying this man's wonderful voice. Ricky Martin can only wish that he had half of Marc Anthony's talent. Marc Anthony is not just a fad or a ""one hit wonder"", he is a perfomer with a voice, charisma and personality that transcends gender, age, cultural, and language barriers. We latinos have known this for years but now that he is going mainstream, the whole world will know it. I have never heard a voice as powerful as Marc Anthony's, his new single ""I need to know"" is awesome and I cannot wait to hear the entire album. I would recommend everyone to buy this album because eventhough I have not heard the whole thing, I am confident that it will be as great as all of his work always is. HE IS THE GREATEST. Ricky Martin, Jennifer Lopez, Enrique Iglesias move over because he comes Marc Anthony to show what REAL TALENT is."
4,Giving it back.....,"Giving it back is correct. It is the only correct way to put this CD out for those who want to hear a new sound of old classics and a couple of new songs. I like it. Some versions could have been better, but over all it's a 4. You think you're tough, back for more, loving you is a dirty job, lay it down. Are the songs that you notice the most change in the voice. George Lynch (Dokken, Lynch Mob, Lynch/Pilson) and Traci Guns (LA Guns, Brides of Destruction) they play good lead on the songs they play. You can tell there is a difference in the solos. I won't listen to this alot, but I did burn most of the songs that are on the cd onto my I-Pod. For those of you who want something new, a classic made better, than this one is for you."
4,Great Job of Looking Back and Forward at Once,"I really enjoyed Loch Ness Leap. It's the first QL book I've read but I enjoyed the way it used two previous leaps from the TV series. It futhered developed the personalities working in the present (future) time. The way the book deals with the delema of time travel and hinting at Ziggy's God likeness was excellent I wish that would have been developed more, even the possiblitiy that it is Ziggy that somehow is keeping Sam from coming home."
4,Laura Ashley Spring Bloom Window Valence,"I love the curtains, but I wish the pattern of the stripes for the 2 valances don't match. But they are very nice!"
4,"U heard WATTS, U heard this...","Well, with the exception of 3 songs; it's pretty much the same. Could be disappointing to some who had PIGMARTYR (under the guise of WATTS) repeatedly on their cd players (like i did) this year. It sure is fun & exciting to hear some new stuff from the Lord of LaRD himself and this disc will probably appeal to new and old hog-listeners; giving a chance to some who missed the first incarnation of this album. Good quality industrial-rock, a good blend of slow and fast songs that you could expect but never predict from Raymond. I just wished he wrote a whole new record. Was this the reason of his absence in HAU RUCK?"
1,I am noit a fan any longer,"Reading the bragging on his myspace page made me laugh out loud.Raymond Watts, if you read this, you've lost one of your biggest fans.This album goes to show very clearly that you have become a talentless hack, or you have lost your mind. What in the hell were you thinking ?That we, your fans and supporters would buy the same stuff 4-10 times in a friggin' row???C'mon man, put 'something' in it, pretend at least that you care about the work that has your name on it. Give us an ounce of 'new' stuff instead of these garbled regurgitations. You had it once... Where did it go ?Anyone reading this should rather pick up the latest NIN, or perhaps HAU RUCK by KMFDM (the people that Watts taught the ropes back in the day, hahaha) or,hell, even Slick Idiot is better than this waste. Sorry dude.... lost me for sure !"
1,Don't buy it,"It's missing the ends of some of the poems, the index doesn't work, and it has fewer poems than my hard-copy of the same name. Get one that is complete."
4,Good,"Product was very long and obtrussive, but was very well made. I would recommend the product to other people looking for a quality leather holder."
1,"Patti is great, Shame on Flare!","I am a fan of Patti Page and has been collecting her CD through the years. The latest compilation is great news for her fans because there are more than a dozen tracks that could not be found elsewhere. But unfortunately, the record company chose to manufacture this CD on cheap, self-destructive CD-R, rather than the common silver-surface CD. (I bought 3 different copies of the same record, but all of them turned out to be printed on CD-R). So buyers beware!!If you want to read more about my personal experience with CD-R, please read my other review: http://www.amazon.com/gp/cdp/member-reviews/A21SY1XMVRH3YQ/ref=cm_cr_pr_auth_rev?ie=UTF8&sort;_by=MostRecentReview"
4,Lights In A Fat City - 'Somewhere' (City Of Tribes),"Almost as mind-blowingly outstanding as their 'Memory Ground' effort (see my review). Simply more 'new age'-like ambient trance groove sounds from LIAFC here to thoroughly take in. Tunes here that more than made me float up (er,I mean sit up) and take notice were ""When I Go Up (I Feel Like Shouting)"", the experimental ""Valley Of The Winds"",""Zzzzzp"" and the thirteen-minute atmospheric piece ""Guboo"".Don't think I've EVER seen an ensemble make SUCH great use of a didgeridoo before.An absolute should-have."
3,Django in Rome 1949-1950 4-cd box set on JSP,"Worth the price alone for the unique version of ""Minor Blues '49."" But, not much more. Django without the Quintette du Hot Club de France may let you down and, unfortunately, many of the recordings presented here by JSP have been mastered a little quickly with the pitch. Or, perhaps they were released without proper mastering. Either way, if you don't mind a few ""chipmunk"" sounding guitar runs, then this set won't let you down. Especially for 15 bucks. Hey, it's Django! Even if the music sounds like the band's on meth once in a while.Be sure to give a good listen to the sample Mp3s listed under each of the 4 individual discs before purchasing. Sample Mp3s aren't listed under the box-set."
1,Trash,"The price reflects the quality of this film. Too many things are wrong with this movie to name. First of all, the script is HORRID, and most of the acting is HORRID, its very boring. Secondly, the actor looks nothing like Lansky. The best part of the movie was the beginning when they showed Meyer and Bugsy as kids. It was all downhill from there. I recommend the BONANNO movie instead of this crap, THAT even had more details and interesting bit about Lansky than this flick."
2,What a Disappointment!,"As a big fan of mafia related movies, I was very disappointed with this movie. Lansky floats back and forth from past to present making it hard to follow and irratating. This film has a plot as good as any, however this plot is shot with poor actor selection and goofy directing. Don't waste your time on Lansky."
5,WIRELESS WIND & DIRECTIONAL SENSOR,This item replaced a malfunctioning Wind and Speed Sensor I purchased as part of a Lacrosse Technology Wireless Weather Station WS-2010. My recent puchase functions perfectly well and I am totally satisfied.
4,Very usefull and easy to read,"This book offers a simple but robust method of trading on stockmarkets. The presence of many many (sometimes too many) charts makes it possible to read on the beach, not just behind the computer.The Momentum Stock Selection method is good. Bernstein claims that you can use the method on intraday basis. This is true, but not in the same simple way as he shows in the book, it takes a lot more interpretation and experiments (on paper first is my advice!!).His rules on do's and don'ts in trading are absolutely valuable and true, and funny to read of you have done all the don'ts already in the past."
5,This book is sweet and simple!,"I enjoy how this book offers a highly robust, yet simple trading system, applicable to any market. I have used the Momentum Moving Average approach with great success. I have noticed that it often forecasts majors rallies and drops in a timely fashion. Apply these methods to your trading and you will see the profits!"
3,"just a good read, but not the best trading book","this is a good book and well written. very easy to read and understand.however, it comes across as too simple. the methods that are discussed here does not really give you the confidence that they are sufficient for you to trade properly.another book by this author on the psychology part of trading, 'IQ the investors quotient', is a much better and strongly recommended read. in terms of market momentum, martin pring's 'trading with oscillators' is more useful, and just as easy to read."
5,GREAT READING IF YOU'VE JUST WATCHED THE NEWS,"This book came out at the end of the last century-- 1999. Contains prayers for the next thousand years from every tradition you can think of-- all the great religions, world cultures, indigenous leaders, writers,contemporary singers. You name it. Special messages from living masters for the next millennium. Great reading, especially if you've just watched the news."
4,Prayers for a Thousand Years,This book is full of prayers that fit for many occasions. Used one for gathering within week of receiving it.
2,Not what I expected.,"Soulive is an amazing group of musicians! When I got this album I expected it to be all musical selections; however all but one track has vocals. I understand the need to want to try new things and experiment a little, but this album really leaves the listener scratching their head. The music is great! The vocals...well...you decide. The previous albums had vocals, which in those cases really seems to add to the musical elements, but I'm not sure the vocals and the music jive on this one. I was sadly disappointed with this album, but others may love the new direction they've taken."
3,Still cool but replaceable...,"This Soulive album is quite different. The stax-attitude and the decision to force vocal songs is cool, but unfortunately the band loses a lot of their uniqueness. I miss the tight, riff-based, barebone trio grooves, in fact that's why I love this band soooo much! This is still cool, but compare this record to the fantastic ""doin' something"" (for an example) to see what I mean. I'm a bit sad and hope that this record is just a ""spin-off"" in musical style."
4,So What? Soulive!,"This album is a slight departure from most of Soulive's catalog... They've added lyrics! If you are not a fan of Soulive having a singer, don't buy this album, you'll just be all sore and grumpy. If you appreciate everything that Soulive does (I do, except for Next), plunk down your money on this bad boy, bring it home, put on the stereo and sit back for some smooth, funky righteous tunes.... or something like that."
1,straight up... no groove,"So, Soulive fans get steamed when reviewers don't like this cd because they are comparing it to either live shows, old studio work or preconceived expectations. How about this review then: IT'S BORING!From beginning to end the album takes me nowhere. I don't listen to music to be bored. I listen to be moved, and when this new effort is finally over... I didn't go anywhere.The best thing about 'No Place Like Soul' is the name.For me, it's not the fact that there is now a full time vocals, it's not even the sound of his voice, it's the uninteresting/watered down song writing and composition. I'll listen to just about anything as long as the songs are well written and well played.This seems to me to be a phoned in effort by the brothers when it came to constructing some tunes.Terribly unfortunate!"
3,Be Warned,"I'm a big SOULIVE fan and I paid extra for the import version of this just to get it early. Let's just say I was upset listening to this CD for the first time. I usually skip over the vocal tracks on every other SOULIVE project. THERE ARE ONLY TWO TRACKS WITHOUT VOCALS. Both of those tracks are excelent especially ""Bubble"". I wasn't really feelin' the vocal cuts at all until I went to see them live. The live perfomance made me want to listen again. There are a few catchy songs on there like ""One of Those days"" and ""Mary"" but this project showcases vocals with SOULIVE as the backup."
4,Good but heavy,"I really like the pair for their looks. The smaller one is perfect but the bigger one, I found a bit too large and the lid does not fit very well. Though heavy, easy to clean. I got them through a promotion offer. So I feel they are worth more than what I paid"
3,"Very beautiful, but easy to be broken","It looks very nice. But when I washed it and touched the tap a little bit, it was broken. So if you want to buy it, you should be very careful."
3,Good product but the packing is not right,"I ordered two sets of this. When they were arrived, the lids of one set were broken. I sent the broken set back and about 1 month to now I have not received the replaced set back. They are good product, but please treat them well when packing. The lids should be fixed on the cardboard more securely, please use tape or some glue if they are needed.Update: Finally received my replacement set after about 5 months. This time Amazon wrapped it carefully, no damage at all. Thanks Amazon."
5,Corelle casserole dishes,We were looking for the perfect casserole dishes and certainly found them. The order came in on time and in perfect condition.
2,broken twice,I HAVE TRIED TO PURCHASE THIS SET TWICE. Both times the lids were delivered broken. I gave up and ordered units without lids.
1,mishy,"dont buy this item and dont waste your money,i ordered this and recieved the broken pieces and when i cald amazon and asked for a replacement they sent it today and its broken again,so annoying that they dont know how to pack it,they dint even use bubble wrap to pack it,waste of money and iam really disappointed because i wanted to add this to the callaway set i have,i gave it 1 because there is no option to give it a 0"
2,Tops don't fit,"These items seem too heavy for Corelle, much heavier than theCorelle that I have. The tops don't fit well, either, and I would guess they weren't made for these dishes.."
1,Broken on arrival,This product is not packed to be shipped well. Inside the box that came from the mfg. there is nothing to prevent breakage when shipped through the mail. And it did arrive broken! The box that Amazon sent it in was packed very well but still did not keep it from getting broken.
1,broken TWICE,"This isn't a review of the product since we could never use it. We ordered this because the price looked so good and we thought it would be a nice set to have. The first time it arrived the delivery person advised us to open it- sure enough it was SHATTERED beyond recognition (though it made a pretty sound). So we rejected the box. We decided to give it a second go, thinking they couldn't possibly botch the packing twice. Lo and behold the second set arrived - at least recognizable as cookware this time - but broken again. It is so clear from someone who packs and sends items that whoever packed this assumed it was a box of bricks. Many of the packing airbags were FLAT in both cases, but there wouldn't have even been enough to stop breakage even if they were all inflated. Essentially three sides of the box were padded, not even top and bottom. No more fragile purchases here!"
5,"Excellent career advice, no matter what your age!",I recommend this book to anyone who wants to change careers but isn't sure how. This inspiring collection of case studies show by example the exciting and innovative ways one can find a rewarding career. The book provided the tools and inspiration I needed to find the career of my dreams. I strongly encourage anyone who is thinking about a career transition and needs a jumpstart to get this book.
2,Cuter online than in person,"I bought these because I couldn't afford a more expensive, cuter pair. I liked these shoes online, but when they came in person, the greenish color didn't look very good as a shoe. The edges of the straps were a little unfinished. The bottoms were actually pretty comfortable, but the buckle in the front was the ultimate reason I got rid of them. It dug into the front-top of my foot and hurt throughout the day. I have size 6 feet and don't know if they would be better or worse for bigger feet. Overall, I need to learn to stop buying shoes online that I haven't tried on first."
3,Not for TOTAL beginners,"This DVD is not for your absolute ground level beginner. I keep having to look up at the TV to see where she is, which causes me to slow down and lose my place in the flow parts. She moves too fast for an utter novice like me. I can see liking this video after I get a little stronger and a little more familiar with yoga, but I'm going to need something slower and easier for starters."
5,Love!!,I absolutely LOVE this DVD!! I do yoga 2-3 times a week along with cardio and strength training 3-4 times a week. this is just what my body needs to stretch and recover. the cues are easy to follow and Bethany is very pleasant and soothing.
3,Middle of the road,"Background music is important to me as it sets the tone or mood. I thought it was kind of hard to hear in this workout. The instructor seems very pleasant, but she she uses the word ""beautiful"" several times - enough that it caught my attention and I wished she'd stop. Probably not a bad workout, but overall, it just didn't really stand out for me as something I'd want to do over & over. Since I have other yoga DVDs that I like much, much better, I won't be keeping this one on my shelf."
1,Am I the only one bothered by...,"The fact that these damn things are in ziplock bags, and the companies site states they accept returned sex toys as long as YOU state you haven't used them? Sanitizer or not this is disgusting. Already emailed demanding a Refund. So nasty. DO NOT BUY Unless you like the possibility of your sex toys being used. Seriously gross. I'm still fighting the urge to bleach my hand for touching a Handle. Sidenote: Batteries not included."
3,no pouch so disappointed,I ordered this thinking that it came with the little black bag as well. Of course it didn't! False advertising in my opinion. That's really the reason I bought this one versus others just like it. It works really well though so I guess I can live without the pouch. The bullet part was much bigger than I thought it was going to be. It's about the size of a small egg! I had never seen one that big before!
2,Not so powerful,"I bought these as a replacement because I REALLY enjoy the bullet. These arent even in the same ballpark as my previous bullet, they barely have any power. I was extremely dissappointed."
4,Quantity VS Quality,"So......it give great massages, but not a LOT of massages, if you know what I mean. Good thing it came with so many, or else I might not be. Make sense?"
3,Liar...,"Didn't include any pouch. Its wonderful and effective but no ""satin pouch"" or any pouch to speak of."
1,USB Travel Kit,This does not work. It drains your device instead of charging it. Not worth the money. SAVE YOUR MONEY. DON'T PURCHASE!
1,DONT BUY!!!!,i previously wrote a bad review complaining about the quality of the product and how it only work for about 2 weeks before it died...anyways i was contacted by the seller stating i would get a refund if i took off negative feedback needless to say i never received a refund...so just want to warn future buys that this product sucks !!!
1,Junk does not working for Apple,"Useless crap. Does not work on Apple iPad. iPad says ""not charging"" when plugged in with these tools. No wonder it costs $3. How much more single $ bills I should spend to learn. Duh...I did not know it is Chinese Co. Trusted Amazon."
1,Don't waste your money or time,First charger didn't work so company sent another one. That one did not work either. The cable did but the reason I wanted a 2nd charger was to leave at my daughters house so I didn't have to carry one back and forth when I go there to babysit. Buy USA like I did the next time and it will work. The cable works just fine so bought a quality charger and I'm good to go.
4,Very good Apple iPod Travel Kit,Great gadget to have if you have a ipod touch even you don't travel much. I use my ipod at home a lot and this great to a charge. I would recommend this product and the price was great.
2,good back up charger,"This charger setup is made with cheap plastic. FYI, its good for an emergency backup charger but not for every day use"
3,Not bad as compared to price,"Using Travel adapter (USB charger) and is very useful. Material is not of good quality and was not expecting compared to the price. Faced an issue with rotating wheel inside cable, but got fixed easily at home by opening screw in it.Will recommend considering Travel kit is very handy, light weight and low price."
2,car charger and cable work alright. wall adapter is junk,i bought this because of the price. well.. i got what i paid for. the car adapter works alright no complaints. the cord is handy but sometimes does not want to retract. the wall adapter got super hot and melted (literally) the first night i used it.
5,Awesome,"I no longer have to find a computer to charger my iPod touch, now I have my music with me no matter where I go! Great buy!"
1,Did not work,The car dc plug in charger did not work. Made my phone beep and vibrate. threw it away.
1,Don't buy ! Broke in 1 day after use!,"I brought for temporary use since I left my charger at a friends house a state away. It is a waste of 5 dollars since you have to basically pay for shipping. That's how they get your money. DON'T buy it!! I'm upset with my purchase, I only used it one day, the next day, charger and usb cord stopped working. Don't waste your money on cheap chargers, they could break your IPHONE. Lesson learned.. hope this helps your buys.. b/c mine is in the garbage."
3,Not so good,"When it first arrive, the wall charger didn't work at all. After I contacted the seller, they sent me a replacement. This time the charger works, but sometimes there is a problem with charging. The seller's response is quick and patient, but the product is not so good."
2,Seemed like a good idea. Not really,"Seemed like a great idea. It was cheap. I just wanted something I could travel with in case it got damaged or lost. The wall plug was complete crap. Broke off in the wall, that was hard to get out without shocking myself. the cord wouldn't wind back up and the car plug didn't work. Complete crap. I guess sometimes you get what you pay for."
1,this product is trash,This is the worst product I have purchased on Amazon. I plug it in the wall and it just falls out. it is very poorly made. will not make that mistake again
4,Okay,The cord is flimsy and may break through time. However it's great for the price! Cannot complain. Works fine just like the real thing
2,Product Review,This product is good for the price. The only problem i had with this product is that when i plugged the car charger into my vehicle it blew a fuse so i replaced the fuse just thinking it was an old fuse and plugged the charger back in and it did the same thing. on the plus side the wall charger works great.
1,didn't quite work...,"I bought this hoping it was cheap and good. Eventually, I knew more expensive products are better. The first few times i used it, it was working fine, but then all of a sudden it stopped working even though i never did anything to it or used it a lot. But, the car charger worked fine... and the usb cable occasionally disconnects from my computer when it is plugged in. I bought the Belkin Swivel iPod Charger because I thought Belkin was better...and it did work! it lasted for a long time...this product is a waste of money..even though it's only $1.39 + shipping."
3,Apple iPod USB Travel Kit with Car Charger/Travel Adapter/Cable-White,"Think it was a bit deceiving the item is listed as Apple iPod USB travel kit with car charger, etc. by iPod. Makes it sound like it is an Apple product and it definitely is not. However it was VERY inexpensive, guess that should have been my first clue it was probably a dollar store version!!!The construction is a bit chintzy but it does work. I wanted it as backup and haven't used it much. For my needs, it's fine."
1,Chargers and Adapters for iPod,Not the best quality. They broke or would not charge the iPods a few months after purchase. We eneded purchasing new ones at the store.
1,dont waste your money my apple Ipad retina isnt charging and i am trying to get the people to tell me what to do beside throw it,nothing works and i dont have a charger now. I bought the 15ft cord for my ipad it doesnt work and i dont have a charger for it now i have a apple retina ipad i bought all the items for it none work. the adapter. so unhappy. i depend on my apple now i have to figure out where to get all my chargers from a good dealer. before my apple goes dead. Didnt hear back yet from the company i bought the cord or the charger from yet either.
2,Ipod charging devices,The car charger didn't work and I kept on getting messages on my ipod about the charger not being supported with the ipod. The cord does work though and it is nice that it is retractable. you get what you pay for.
5,Compact and versatile,"I purchased this product for my kids' new iPods touches. It's compact and versatile (wall charger, car charger, USB charger). Works well!"
5,as advertised,"This kit has everything I needed. All pieces work. I'm a cheapskate, and liked the price. Not disappointed at all."
1,Worst Product,"I bought this product one week ago and I opened today the cable is not working.There are many cables that are coming for $1 or less but I bought this for almost $7.00.So Please don't buy this item.Thanks,"
2,Cheaply made chargers,Most of the chargers hold little to no charge for your device and when you receive them you can tell they were made with cheap quality.
5,usb travel kit for Apple Ipod,"works well, I have a charger for home and my car. The product is lightweight. recommend this product to anyone looking for a travel package for their ipod."
1,Waste of time and money Apple charger,Product was the worst purchase I ever made from amazon. If you are thinking of purchasing this product think again and DON'T !!
1,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!,"I was SOOOO disappointed with this item. It did not show up until after the time I could return it and it doesn't work at all!!!! I am so disappointed. I did not know it was coming from China. At least on Ebay you know these things! It makes me leary to even use Amazon, cause so many things are not being sold by Amazon. What a waste of money!!!"
1,Speaker accessories,Received speakers in disrepair. Therefore these items are useless.It would cost as much to return. As it cost.Complete waste of time and money.
1,Cheap and doesn't charge iPad,"Both the wall charger and car outlet only give out about an amp, and the iPad requires around 2. I specifically bought this to charge my iPad, so it's useless to me. That said, it does say iPod charger, and not iPad, so caveat emptor (i.e. ""buyer beware"".)The construction is as cheap as you'd expect for around $4. The USB port on the wall charger was crooked to the point that it was almost unusable. The retractable data cable works about 3 times after which the spring gives out and it becomes unusable. It's also shorter than standard cabled when fully extended, making it a hassle. Going in the trash.Update September 7, 2011: The top of the lighter adapter popped off while it was sitting on the passenger seat."
1,Not as advertised....,When I ordered I assumed that you could use this to recharge my iPhone... WRONG. Doesn't charge the phone while. Not sure why they'd send a cigarette plug in if it wasn't for that reason. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT! It's a SCAM!
2,Charges very slowly.,"This kit works, but doesn't charge quickly at all. I guess not much is to be expected for the price. It has become a back up charger that is only used in dire emergencies when there is no access to a normal charger. Many times the phone or iPod plugged in will say charging is not supported with this device. So sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't."
4,For the price its a bargain.,"The only complaint I have about it so far is the car charger.It only charges when the car is off (no idea why), but other than that it works fine.Only thing that worries me is that it gets incredibly hot when charging.No problems with it so far though.Also I read other reviews about the the cable messing up your iPod and rendering it useless, so I have not used it in fear that it might screw my iPod up since its a 32GB 4G.I have not tested it and wont risk my new iPod.The wall charger is the best part however.It works perfectly, no complaints about it.Plus it has a usb slot meaning I can use it to charge other electronics.For how much it cost its worth it.I also got it within a week even though it was supposed to ship in a month."
2,usb Travel Kit,"This was a good product, broke in to pieces , I like but i will never order this product again. I will try to fine me another charger"
3,Meh.,"What is in the picture is not what you get. What you do get is kind of cheap looking and the cable is like in one of the retractable ones. Not very happy, but it gets the job done, I guess."
1,Waste of money,The car adapter of this product does not work. In fact it almost started a fire in my car. It was not worth the shipping price to return.
2,"Charges fine, but too much static with car charger","I was hoping to use this to be able to listen to my iPod while charging it in the car. Unfortunately, it generates so much static that is is unlistenable while charging.The good news is that it does charge successfully, and I like the flexibility of being able to use it as a wall charge instead of a car charger. I am actually just using it now as a spare charger at work. That's not what I intended, but the price is so ridiculously low, it is not worth the hastle to return it."
3,iPod Travel Kit CAUTION!!!,"The travel kit charges my iTouch in an hour and its convenient to use the charger that plugs into an outlet. I like how you can remove the usb cable from the plug. The car charger is a different story, the very first time I charged my iTouch in my car it started to smoke three seconds after plugging it in. It doesn't work in my car, it ends up heating up or smelling like smoke when I use it. I wouldn't recommend using the car charger unless you are going to keep your eye on it. Can this cause your car to catch fire?! IDK. You've been warned."
1,"Zero stars for the product, 4 stars for the customer service.","I ordered this to replace my old car adapter when it bit the dust on a recent trip. The first unit I ordered didn't work. So I contacted the seller and they promptly sent out a replacement, which didn't work either. I tried both units in wall sockets and in the car in the cigarette lighter socket. Neither unit worked even though the iPod charged just fine in it's cradle at home. I'm contacting the company about a refund, and expect them to respond quickly. They were very good about sending out a replacement product as soon as I complained about the first one. The customer service was great, I wish the product were as good! The reason I only gave it four stars was that I paid for express shipping, and it took over a week to get the original adapter. The replacement took about four days, even though it was being shipped in the same state. I took off a star for slow shipping."
3,cheap but it works,"Well the retractable piece on the USB cord broke within a week, and the pieces are obviously very cheaply made. Nevertheless, it works.. and for $5, I don't suppose one can complain about quality."
5,Pretty decent product,"Product is pretty decent, so far so good, just as advertised. Works like a charm with ipod, infect the car charger can also be used for charging my blackberry / rarz phone, since it is USB enabled."
1,avoid this product,"so cheap. how could you *not* buy this? it screwed up my ipod after using it for a few weeks. now i have issues powering down my ipod. it won't turn off. weird. i've heard this complaint from others, too."
1,Simply doesn't work!,The cables and adapters of this unit are of very poor quality. No power gets from either the ac or car adapter through the usb port to the ipod cable. Caveat emptor!
1,Sucks,I purchased an item from amazon a month or so ago. It has been so long i don't even remember when i purchased the item. I have to this day not received the item. I guess it is my fault for trusting someone on the internet.I hold amazon.com for responsible for my product not getting to me. I am wondering if because they are such a big corp. that the little people don't matter. Dollars and cents matter to all that shop on line. No matter the cost everyone should be as important as the next person. Guess not!!!!!
1,Month and a half later,"Can't believe this took a month and a half to get. Ended up getting a different one rather than wait so this will be a back up, I guess"
1,You get what you pay for...,I've had this package for a few months. I sent one to a buddy of mine too. I've only begun to utilize the car charger in the past two weeks because I now have a phone to charge that is compatible with it. Well the point at the top snapped off. A loose spring is all I have at the tip.2 weeks of use. I'm always careful with it. I put it away after use. And it comes apart. Something to think about. Next time I'm spending a few more bucks for a better product.
1,????????,I have not received it. i got one item from my order but nothing from this order. why is that ummm still waiting ?????????????????????????????????????
3,One item did not work,the outlet charger did not work. Everything else is working and very handy. we specially like the car charging tool.
1,its junk!!!!!!!!,"The item arrived right a way, but niether the car charger nor the home charger worked.USB Travel Kit with Car Charger, Travel Adapter & Cable for Apple iPod"
4,Handy and does the job.,"This set has been very helpful to me, especially since the usb port end is able to used with different adaptors. I keep one set by my computer and one in my purse for use when I'm out and about and my device dies. It's not terribly high quality, but sturdy enough to do the job. I like the handy wind-up for the cord which keeps the whole thing tidy and compact. The wind-up mechanism is a little hard to get it to work, sometimes, but with a little patience the cord can be successfully wound back up - even so, it's handy and I'm glad to have it."
4,Great deal,"Second time I buy that pack. Set is of good quality except for the car plug, which I broke quite fast the first time."
4,great but has some problems,the cord works great but the wall charger broke after a week or two but overall its a great charger i would buy it again if it breaks
1,Ordered not taking chances,"I dont have this but its is on its way and is to late to cancel the shipment. All i'm saying is don't take your chances on this, because im definatly not using this on my brand new ipod."
3,not worth the wait,It was quite excited to finally receive my package from Hong Kong China. Unfortunately the charger for the care does not work and has not worked since the day I received it. I didn't have any other issues with this except for the car charger.
2,You get what you pay for,"Bought this for my Ipod 4g....Usb cord works for Computer, Car charger works, so actually the price paid covered these in my opinion. AC Charger was broken when arrived. Tab on inside of USB port bent back and does not make contact so doesn't charge. For the price it was not worth the hassle of sending back, return postage would have been more than the product. Not really the sellers fault, bad manufacturing, I guess... Well off to Walmart to buy a better one."
3,Doesn't work,"This item is not working, I got a message in me cell ""this disvace is not compatible"" made in China is not always good"
4,accessories,this was an item that i ordered for some one and they told me that they were pleased with it. There is really no more to say
3,nice for the price,Arrived earlier than expected. A great combo deal for the price. USB cord is great for travel you can throw in your pocket and go. Have currently not had any problems with this product.
1,shorted out either the ipod or the ipod battery,"When we plugged in the ipod to charge, there was a pretty loud electrical POP - and then the ipod didn't work. Talked to apple and they said it could be the battery, but either way it was going to be at least an $80 attempt to fix so we bought a new one. The ipod was a nano and several years old ... but worked great. The company refunded our money and apologized, but I'll never buy a non-apple electronic accessory again. I've learned my lesson. You get what you pay for."
5,great product,this is a great 3 in one charger and works wonderfully!! It works great in the wall or in the car or even on computer. very cheap and does the job just as good as regular charges do.
1,Worked well--but less than a week,"The portable charger was a gift for our son. He used it and the wall charger worked well, until it stopped working/charging less than a week after Christmas. It has a red glow when it charges. The unit no longer turns red or charges once you plug a device in.I contacted the seller who replied promptly (within 30 minutes) and will send me a new one. Hopefully the 2nd charger will last longer."
5,"Works Excellently, love the compact design","This charger does what it's supposed to do. It charges, syncs things to your ipod. Best of all it can coil into a compact design rather than a long cord that can easily be damaged. The cheap price for all that I get makes it all the more worth it."
2,Works only 1/4 of the time,"When I first tried out the car charger on my iPod touch, it worked fine. But later on it stopped recognizing the iPod and it wouldn't charge. I'd say it charges the iPod only about one-fourth of the time I plug it in. I always check the connection, but that doesn't seem to get the charger to recognize the iPod."
2,works ok. lose connection. great price.,"the product is aftermarket, but does what is expected. the price can't be beat! construction is mediocre at best."
1,Broke within a week!,"They are cheap, cheap, cheap!! The end of the car charger got stuck in the power outlet in my vehicle! It took me a half hour to get a small piece of metal out of my power outlet. Not a good time!! Within a couple of days, The travel adapter broke into pieces... I can't even describe what that looks like right now. And not long after that, the wall charger broke apart when I was pulling it out of the outlet. I am not rough on these type of things. I was extremely disappointed when I opened the package and noticed how cheaply they were made but I gave them the benefit of the doubt and, unfortunately, was proven to be correct."
5,Fast and precise,The price is unbeatable. The shipping was super fast and the product works wonderfully. The wall charger doesn't quite charge as fast as my original charger but it works fast enough.
3,fell apart,"The car charger fell apart, but I still use the regular plug. It doesn't seam to charge my I touch, just my nano and shuffle."
1,DOESN'T WORK...,"I purchased 3 of these so that my family members could travel with them. It took a while to get here and when I pluged it up in every configuration possible, they DID NOT WORK. I'm only out a little less than 8 bucks, but the saying is true...you get what you pay for...cheap doesnt always mean a good deal...it sometimes means junk!"
1,Terrible Product!!!!,"This product is junk. First when I plugged it into my iPod, a message on my iPod said this device is not compatible with my iPod. I ignored it at first, but a minute later a burning smell started coming from my iPod. I don't recommend this product at all. The makers and sellers of this product in China should be ashamed that they sell a product this useless. I wouldn't have bought this product if I knew it was pure junk."
5,Great buy,This charging system is a great buy. It works great in the car or in the home and is compact and easy to store.
2,Bad connections,I often get the message from my iphone that the device is not acceptable for charging. If I disconnect/reconnect sometimes it works.
1,Ipod charger did not work,"I received this charger and planned on using it at my work, so I don't have to drag one back and forth, but to simply put it, it did not and does not work."
1,piece of crap,"This thing will mess up your ipod-- every time you leave it plugged in for awhile, your ipod will not turn off, and will stay on until the battery runs out. The USB adapter works ok, but the ipod adapter is worthless. Just spend the money and get the apple version-- it's a ripoff but it works, and you'll end up buying it anyway, after you get sick of this piece of junk."
1,Cheap knock-offs,"Do not attach this to your Ipod or Iphone unless you want to fry them and void your warranty by not using Apple products. These are very cheaply made and of poor quality, use it at your own risk."
2,"Ok, i guess","The product i bought was supposed to be able to charge my itouch,but one of the three parts of the set malfunctions... The only reason i did not return this was because i was able to utilize the other parts along with one of my own wires to accomplish my goal. Overall, i am not happy that not all of the set worked ."
5,perfect,i cant believe you get all this for such a low price and it all works great! great product for a great price!
2,dis-satisfied,The retracting cord that came with the set did not fit the ipod. I still had my original USB cable so I just attached the adapter to it to use it and it worked fine. I also was dissatisfied with the car charger which only worked about twice before it stopped charging. Overall it was a waste of money.
4,Ipod charger,"this is a very handy charger. It comes with a wall charger, a car charger, and a connector. it is in a small bag that doesn't take a lot of space."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"I bought this item for my wife so that she could charger her iPod Touch without tying up one of the USB ports on the computer. She was happy until she tried to use it. The wall adapter will not stay plugged into the wall. I tried several different receptacles in the house and got the same results. The blades are too thin. I purchases a Belkin Wall Charger to replace it and had much better results.Also, the SHORT retractable cord make it dificult to place the iPod on a table while charging. I'm not to pleased to have to set it on the floor just because the cable is so short."
3,Good product,This works great. Good value! The only problem I have with it ts that the charging cord is very short. That makes it difficult to work with
5,Loves it,"I Bought this for younger sister works great as far as I know also arrived in great time, thanks much"
3,Recharger kit for Apple ipod,USB cable was not as described it was retractable which will tangle>.not a bad price. Hopefully it will hold upThank you
3,"Looks and feels crappy, but it works","These pieces have come in handy on the road or if I'm desperate, but they just have that feeling that any day now, they'll just stop working. Wouldn't rely on them for a trip, but rather as a last resort set of charging paraphernalia."
2,NOT AS EXPECTED,"the usb is hard and is too thick to fit in the ipod., Just read customer review and do not expect things to be great at this price"
1,this item not good,i give this prouduct a very low rating this porduct i order but i relly dislike it because it didint relly work on my ipod touch
3,"These appear to be working, but the connection isn't the greatest.",The connection isn't the greatest. You need to ensure that it it pushed together tightly to make the proper charge.
1,disappointed,"worked for less than a week than than the cord part, which they have since changed (it used to roll up to become a small compact piece), went to crap. The car charger part never worked and the wall one works some of the time now"
2,Quality is not great,"I purchased this set to keep in my car. It doesn't appear to be typical Apple quality. The charger appears to be ok, but the USB line is already cracked around the connection and doesn't seem to connect well to keep charging. Maybe we received a bad set, but I don't think I would buy this again."
1,What a piece of junk!,"The AC charger part worked ok, but the car charger part never did charge my iPOD. Sure, the red indicator light came on, but nothing else happened. I've gone through quite a few different chargers as my electronics have come and gone over the years, and now, I won't buy anything from the Asian countries online. Their quality control is a joke; and I'm tired of spending money on dud electronics accessories. After a while, it's worth it to just buy a more well-known brand in the store - they last longer."
1,0- If I could,"I would rate this product, a 0 if I could.The only part that works was the wall charger,the car charger is horrible, and the usb cord partis poop. This is the only product that I not liked fromAmazon!"
1,Not worth even a dollar,While using the car-charger the connections becomes loose every few seconds and the phone does not get charged. Completely useless.
3,all right,Average quality product but despite that effectively load iphone nano and shuffle are the ones I have and hopefully last me a good experience is not damaged recommended ..!
1,Cheap & not worth the wait!,It took over a month to arrive. The quality was cheap. The USB cable won't fit the car charger! I tossed it in the garbage. Good thing I did not pay a lot of money for it. It was a waist of time!!!
1,Lost of Money,The car lighter charger only works during two days. Don't lost your money buying this item.The wall charger is still working well.
1,Used once - nearly ruined my iPod Touch,"This thing is a waste of money that may ruin the device you are trying to charge. I used the plug-in adapter portion of this one time with my iPod Touch. Fortunately I was also using the iPod while it was charging; so, I saw when the iPod came up with a warning that it was overheating and the screen shut off. I immediately unplugged it and it was several minutes before the iPod cooled off enough to come back on.When I bought it, there weren't that many negative reviews. Coming back and reading them makes me realize how fortunate I am since others have had their equipment fried by this thing. My recommendation: It's not worth the risk. Don't buy it!"
3,buy if you need something quick,"I purchased this item for my 14 year old son for his ipod and it lasted a whole week before it broke. no wonder why it was less than $4. like it states, buy it if you need something cheap and quick but not for it to last!!"
5,Worth the money,I have ordered 2 of these and the work perfectly! I am able to have 2 in the car and 2 in the house now. With a 4 year old son and an 8 year old daughter they have really come in handy and they were so cheap I hesitated buying them!
3,works but does not charge,I bought this because my ipod was always dying in the car and I am not very good at bringing it in to charge. It does keep my ipod going in the car but my ipod is always on dead when plugged into it. It does not charge it but it keeps it running.
1,Car Charger,The car adapter does not charge well. It can be plugged in for hours at a time and the battery bar does not move!
2,"Cable broke within a week, charger components are fine.","The cable is pretty dinky and broke in about one week. The charger components have been working fine and I found a spare OEM cable. For less than $5 it's not a big deal and I'm not really surprised. Don't buy this package for the cable, it will break."
1,Commercial,I regret buying this product because of poor manufacturingRapid destructionDoes not work efficientlyThe pieces are not original as you thinkBut fakeThis tradition is very poorly
2,Car charger was a ripoff,"Car adapater doesn't work. The wall adapter works charges, but is loose in the electric outlet, a little odd."
4,AWESOME for the price,"I definitely recommend buying this. I bought one in September 2009 and it just stopped working yesterday. For the price, it's totally worth it. I'm buying another one now.The only bad thing about it is the wire part. You have to pull on the ends to extend it, which loosens their connection over time. That's why mine broke; the wire pulled away from one of the ends. So try to be careful when you pull it: As soon as you pull the ends a little, grab the wire itself to pull it the rest of the way. That's what I'll do with my new one and hopefully it'll last even longer =)"
1,Wall adapter,"I didnt like the product I bought because the wall adapter doesnt work, it does not let my ipod charge in any wall outlet."
2,You get what you pay for,"Purchased this product since my previous adapter broke. Was pleasantly surprised on the price of .01. Not any more. Didn't work from day 1 but I gave it 2 stars since I am using the USB adapter. So, not all a total waste."
4,First impression is that it is worth the $3!,"Just got this in the mail (took less than a week), and it seems be a decent product for the price. For $3, I'm not expecting Apple quality (and even Apple quality is questionable on chargers, but that's another story), so I'm happy with this purchase. I will update if the car charger doesn't work (haven't tested that yet) or if the product seems to be falling apart quickly."
1,junk,"I bought this set and nothing worked, I am glad it did not cost more, and luckly we had a backup ...thanks for selling a very poor quality product ... it is true you get what you pay for"
1,still have not received...one month later,"still waiting for this item...rediculous. ordered in November...it is now December 30 and still no travel kit. The price was great, however not happy with how long this is taking.**just received today....came from Hong Kong!!! guess that's what took so long. lol"
1,charger did not work,I bought it plugged in my Itouch and the AC adaptor did not work at all. I paid very liitle for this so it did not seem worth the cost of returning it. You get what you pay for. I got ripped off.
1,Biggest waste of four dollars!,"The product didnt work at all, when I contacted the company they refused a refund but offered a replacement. Why would I want a replacement if I dont like the product? Not only did it not work but I am very unimpressed with the customer service. I will never be buying from this company again and I encourage everyone else to be very careful when purchasing a product from this company."
3,WRONG SIZE,"i got this item thinking it would be the same size as an apple charger for the iphone, but it was too big... it will work if you dont have a case 4 it but i have the otter box wich only allows for standard iphone size chargers....."
5,Travel kit,"I have ordered two sets, of these. They have worked good so far. I'm happy with them and the price is great."
1,WISH I HAD READ REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASING THIS,"I wish I had read these reviews before purchasing this junk. Received it yesterday ... dont know what happened but now my IPOD 5th GENERATION wont charge using ANY means!!! I have not had a chance yet to take it into an APPLE store but I'm sure they will say thats what I get for ordering that junk. Does anyone know what happens next? If I cant get it fixed, I will have to buy another IPOD ... will I be able to move my songs to the new IPOD??"
4,"No problems, everything was just as described","I had no issues with this order, everything was fine. Could have been slightly faster on the shipping. Thank you!"
1,Still waiting...,"I would love to rate this item... if I would ever get it. You really can't hate what you don't have. I placed the order on December 26th 2011 and it is now January 28th of 2012. When I placed the order, I was told it was in stock. And while insisting it is in stock, was told it was shipped, I was then given a shipping date of February 8th. I feel like it's being held hostage... I think being told it is in stock so that I will place the order is deceptive if it's not shipped in a timely fashion... still on its way? What? Is it coming on the back of a goat from the Antartic? If this is their way of holding onto customers so they won't order from someone else, they should have their Amazon seller's rights taken away..."
2,Buyer Beware!,"The version with the stretchable cord broke off (the open wires bent & broke) the very first day of use. So far, the wall outlet and car adaptor are working. Inexpensive, but probably not worth it in the long run."
5,It really works!!,"I was a bit skeptical, but figured it was worth a shot for the price. I must say that I'm a few weeks in and have not had any problems. So far it charges and syncs my 4th Gen Itouch perfectly!"
1,Do Not Buy This,"Not only is it extremely cheaply made, but when I plug my phone in it says ""Charging is not supported with this accessory."" So not only is it a useless piece of plastic but its a very cheap breakable piece of useless plastic. Amazon is a great place to shop for a lot of things... but not for this one."
5,Love this,"This made our trip to Florida a lot more bareable, after all if a child ownes a ipod, can they go any where without it!!"
2,Worked good...except,This was everything I expected (cheap quality...which was fine for the price) except it fell out of the wall outlet very easily and thus my phone would be dead when I woke up in the morning and my alarm wouldnt go off. Other than that...good.
3,Great price,"This is a great alternative to paying the high prices that Apple charger you but obviously don't expect Apple quality. I have purchased probably 5 of these in total (for friends) and in most occasions, the car charger doesn't work. Its not a disaster for me as I only need the wall charger and USB cable but again, don't believe they are high quality.They certainly was done the job for years so I am a happy customer."
2,Not powerful enough,"The Apple IPod USB Travel Charger kit is not powerful enough to charge the IPOD. When plugged into computer or electric outlet device gets the message "" not charging""."
1,DANGER! this charger fried my iphone!,"""If it's too good (cheap) to be true...""The first time I plugged in this flimsy charger into my iPhone 3gs, my phone immediately went black!I tried numerous times to restart my phone, but no go. Took it to the apple store and they declared my phone dead!I had to replace the phone for a ""discount"" at $80. So figure that into the cost of this charger.ALSO, I tried plugging the charger back into the outlet again, and the plug began to spark and nearly caught on fire!Hopefully, you'll have better luck than I did.I'll contact the seller now and see what they're response is."
2,ok,I am a 13 year old boy and my mom bought 3 of them for my bro sister and i and they are ok. My sisters Ac adapter overheatd ur iphone but it still works. my bros Ac adapter works fine. and my Ac dapter doesnt charge my ipod. i used my sisters today and it heated up my ipod and shut the itouch off. the itouch wont turn back on even trying the lock and home button method to force restore. the Ac adapter is not very good. but i have used the car charger and that works well. i hope this has helped.
1,Caution!,"I purchased these chargers recently and have used them quite a bit. However, today one of the chargers actually started to melt while plugged in to my vehicle. I am glad we noticed the burning smell before it caused damage to my car. ! I am throwing them away!"
1,Shipping Defects,"I was really dissappointed in this product. the car charger and actual cord seem to work ok, but the wall charger (the one I was really needing) had a broken prong when I got it out of the mailing package. on top of that, the base of the prong looked rusted. I know I payed next to nothing for it, but I would like for my merchandise to be in good shape when I get it out of the package."
4,Excellent product,"You are getting what you pay for here, the durability is a little weak but this product does exactly what it is meant to and it does a good job.It is NOT apple brand, but that is ok! Both the car adapter and the wall charger work perfectly and I personally have had no issues at any point in time with it."
3,looking for accessories for ipod nano,I just found the ipod nano in my drawer and i had decided to get all of the accessories for it to give to my husband. you had the wall charger at a great deal and my husband was happy.
4,Good for what it is.,It works but seems to be made of cheaper product. The wall charger takes a really long time to charge. The car charger is a little bit better. It service it's purpose.
5,Trave charger kit,Another great bargain.. I was doublful it would be sent because it was so cheap and didn't have any shipping charges. Then when it came I thought it probably wouldn't work but it did.
2,kinda cheap product,they work but one of the kids car travler chargers we thru away becouse it smelled like it was burning after just a couple of days and the took forever to get them
3,Okay,"Great price but the products were too delicate and did not last long before malfunctioning. If the recipient is rough with their stuff, this is too delicate."
2,Not a good product,"Apparently this product is a knock off of Apple original. The iPad, iPhone, iPod rejects this product as not being supported by their operating system."
1,Charger stopped working,Car charger stopped working soon after purchasing this set. I was very disappointed but it was not expensive. YOu get what you pay for.
2,doesn't work well,I got this for my daughter and it really doesn't work very well. She is constantly getting an error saying this doesn't work on her device. It worked well when we first got it but now she gets the error. Especially the one for the car charger.
1,Charger/Adapter,"Chargers do not work to charge Iphone or Ipad. I was disappointed in this purchase. I did not send back to seller because the price was so cheap, that it would have just ended up costing more money to send back. I would not order this product again."
3,travel charder,"the travel charger arrived in 8 days. fast for free.but it would only fit, only one of my apple iphones ie my 3gs.not my ipod 4 other wise its great."
3,car charger,"Bought this little package of charges for my grandkids.So glad I did, because when they take their game with themin the car, it seems like they always run their batteriesdown. This is so convenient."
1,do not buy,Broke a week into using it. Not very good quality. Pay more and get a better product. This was a good price but you get what you pay for in this product. Very disappointed.
1,cheap,"very bad quality, and iPhone gave me an error message that the device was not compatibleyou get what you pay for"
3,good for the $$$,is ok? the car port the fuse blow out on my port the wall one does what it made for i dont use the cord much because i use it for travel cord haha (it a travel pack)
2,Don't buy unless you have iphone 3G,"This lovely piece of cheap manufacturing only works on the iphone 3G (which is the only reason it has two stars). I bought this thinking it would work on my 3GS. So if you have a 3G, which few people have now, don't get it. The normal charger for a wall plug won't even accept my phone and says the device isn't suited for it, the car charger does charge your phone 1% every ten minutes if you don't use your phone.Overall: VERY dissapointed. I gave it to my Mom who will be using it for a good month before she upgrades her 3G phone. Then it becomes a useless piece of junk."
3,Just a question.,I have a 1998 Chevy Camaro and I bought this so I could listen to my ipod instead of cd's. I tried every channel on the FM radio and the CD but neither allowed me to play my ipod. How do I get it to work? Any answer would be appreciated.
3,Apple I-Pod Travel kit,very handy...has everything needed to charge I-Pod and the price was 70% below what I found at retail stores...delivery time was as promised...very satisfied
1,do not by this for ur i pod touch it doesn't work,i bought this for my ipod touch 2nd generation and it never worked from day 1. pls dont WAST UR MONEY
3,Cheap,"I haven't used the wall charger yet, but I've used the cable and the car charger. It's cheaply made and has a tendency to snap apart. However, it was less than $3 and it still works. So if you don't want to spend $20 on a charger, this might be for you. Realize that it's cheap, probably won't last a year, but it only costs less than $3. Buy 2 and you'll still come out ahead."
3,So so,The charger and everything works but it is very cheaply made and the retractable cable is very inconvenient. I wouldn't reccomend this product. It's not worth the 4 dollars.
5,Ikingshop,"HElloWhen I got the package, it came unexpectedly earlier than the expected date that was listed on the purchase order. When I received the package, I was super excited. The electrons work amazing, the words listed were true following along with the description of the product.Thank you"
3,Half Works,"Wall charger works with no problem. Car charger doesn't work at all. Price got it 3 stars. Probably should have returned, but honestly it just wasn't worth the time."
1,PIECE OF JUNK,I PURCHASED THIS ALONG WITH 3 OTHER ITEMS FOR MY I-POD. I AM OLD ENOUGH (80) TO KNOW BETTER AND THE REVIEWS WARNED ME. THEY ALL WORKED FOR ABOUT 3 WEEKS THEN THEY WENT ON TO GREENER PASTURES.
1,expected a better quality product ..,"the product 6 months late in arriving at their destination (Venezuela), product is not original, using it two weeks and damage. very bad."
2,Product is as cheap as its price,"Cable broke first time it was used.12V adapter is finicky, we have to twist it to be in just the right position to work.Wall wart works fine - as long as I provide my own USB cable.Over all a disappointment."
3,Won't Fit with case,"Warning: the cable does not fit into my iphone with the case on (I have the otterbox case). The connector is rectangular and wider than the standard curved cable from apple and thus does not fit. However, when used with the supplied cable from apple both the power adapters worked."
3,"Fine for iPod, iPhone - not for iPad","It's fine and inexpensive for an iPhone or iPod, however it won't charge an iPad. Considering the price it's a reasonable deal."
5,perfect car adapter ipod charger,Took awhile for the product to reach me but when i got it worked i loved it. Its so convenient and adaptable. Thanks so much! 5 stars!
4,Nice extra charger set,"Nice, inexpensive charger set. I got this for the car charger for my ipod. I gave the extra charegr to my grandaughter for her ipod. She now has one for her room and for downstairs."
1,Do not recommend!,"Purchased the product because it was cheap! However, after plugging in the car charger in the cigarette lighter, buzzing noises came out of it. There should be no sound coming from it! Just ended up not using it, so please invest money in a better quality charger!"
4,its good,if you have kids then you may need this.helps stop the whining starts because a battery died due to overuse.
1,Can't rate what you don't have.,This company has no right to sell anything. There is no customer help or relief from stupid people. Bad just bad.
1,Cheap,This is a cheap product. I dont like it. Its made of cheap plastic. The corde doesnt wreal up into the mechanisum easly.
4,ok,Wonderful price and product..Easy to use and the price is right...Doesn't work well Try it first please... thanks. !!!! Awesome
1,Poor Quality,"Very flimsy cords, quit working after a few uses. The chargers work with another cord but are VERY slow. Cheaply made. Get what you pay for I guess."
3,Just okay,"Item's shipped quick, but aren't really good quality. I actually found the same ones for sale at the dollar store in my town. I guess it pays to spend more and buy Apple brand."
1,Very cheaply made,"These are very cheaply made. I guess what could I expect for less than $5. The prongs on the wall adapter broke and slide in/out and don't work and the auto adapter has a tension issue and won't stay in the power port in the car. I won't buy this brand again. I will stick with my belkin adapters, at least they will stay in once piece."
1,Upset!,"I ordered this and waited for six weeks for my order to arrive. I finally get the package and the retractable cord doesn't work (I have a 4G Ipod Touch)! Please keep your money and look at the seller's profile to see where the item is being shipped from. I would rate it zero stars if it would let me. I would send it back, but it'll probably cost me more to ship it back then this kit itself."
1,Apple iPod Travel kit,The only thing useful in this kit was the cable. Neither the car charger or the wall charger would recharge my iPod Touch.
1,NOT FOR APPLE IPOD!!!!!,Crap and an outright lie. Used once and got a message that charge was not suypported with this device. Yes it was cheap...but it still pisses me off because I never would have paided even 1 cent for it if I knew it was not for the ipod. And by the way...blame the person doing ther false advertizing not the person who purchased it.
4,Good quality for the price,"The store shipped this very quickly and cheaply. I will say that this is the second time I've needed to buy this charger but for the cost, it's worth it, especially considering how Apple products will eventually break, too and are nowhere near as cheap. Recommend to anyone needing a backup or a quick and cheap replacement."
4,Great set,"Everything worked out of box. I paid $4.50 for it, not it's more than 50% less, it's a steal! The reason for 4/5 stars is because the retractable cable doesn't retract well. Just a small gripe, everything else is great."
1,it doesnt work,the connector doesnt work with my computer. the connector wire is too short and doesn't charge well. it takes forever to charge my phone. not worth it.. dont buy.
2,"Half of it works, but then you get what you pay for... right?",The car charger works but the outlet charger doesn't. Too cheap to bother returning so we're just using the car charger.
4,Great Price,"I was pleased with the speed of delivery and the product was as expected. Is it a little bit cheap? Yes, but it does what it is intended to do so that's no slight on the seller. I couldn't have purchased this product in a store for what I paid for it on Amazon."
2,Junk,"OK, I was cheap and fell for this product. But after all you get what you pay for. The wall plug worked for about 10 minutes and now won't work at all. So far the retractable cord and the car plug still work, but I have severe doubts. It will cost me even more to send it back than what I paid for it, so I'll just toss the wall charger. They couldn't even spell 'China' on the Made in China sticker!! Don't bother with this one."
4,iPod charger,"This product is a good value and works fine. HOWEVER, it is being advertised as an Apple iPod charger and it is NOT an Apple product. It is a smart and inexpensive and versitile product for charging your iPod. All companies should make chargers like this that go from car, outlet and computer. This cuts down on waste and expense. You don't get much less expensive than the cost of this charger. Shipping is very high, but, that's how it goes. I would recommend this charger as very practical, versatile and a great value."
1,DISSATISFIED CUSTOMER,"I have sent notice two times that I have not received the Apple iPod USB Kit w Car Charger/Travel Adapter/Cable White, I have always been satisfied in the past with Amazon, but this time I am not satisfied."
5,Does what it's made for.,"Truth is, I was hoping to be able to use this for my iPod AND for my phone (as my phone charger broke but I have the USB cable) and, unfortunately, the AC adapter did not work with my phone. However, the product is clearly intended for use with iPod, and to that extent it works great. It does what it's made for."
4,Slow shipping,The item works fine so far. It's not heavy duty so if it's going to be in a harsh environment might want to pass. The shipping took about 4 weeks so if you are in a hurry might want to look elsewhere.
2,Not Great,"My two stars are awarded as one star for the customer service and one for car charger. The car charger is the only part of this package that still works. The customer service offered refund or replacement and were courteous. I gave no more stars because fundamentally it does not work. Within a month, the cable and wall charger failed."
1,iWOULDN'T BUY,"I ordered three of these. One for me and two for my nieces who have the iTouch. I thought they'd make a perfect Christmas gift. Everyone needs an extra charger. And at that price? Why not? I almost bought more.They took so long to get here I forgot I ordered them. What finally arrived was an envelope with nine pieces inside. I plugged one in right away. While my iPhone was charging I started playing Words With Friends. The game began misbehaving, having a mind of it's own. Then texts from earlier in the day started popping up as if they were just getting sent. My first reaction was there was something wrong with my iPhone. I switched to my old charger and things went back to normal.I tried the charger again the next day. Same stuff. I threw them out. Don't waste your money."
1,Product Does Not Work (PDNW),"I try to use the product to charge mi Ipad 2 and in the screen of the Ipad you can se ""Not Charging"". Also the products looks very low quality, it looks like it will break at any minute. I do not recomended to buy this product"
4,item you can relay on,This kit is the reason that my son's ipot touch barely rest and do. work great a very where. It is a must have specially at this price
3,flimsy but usable,the ipod charger itself seems very flimsy and not as sturdy like it seems in the picture.butit does come with a car charger and i didnt have to pay for shi[pping& handeling so it was a decent purchase.
4,"So Far, So Good","I purchased this kit to charge my iPhone and iPod Touch. When I read a lot of the negative comments about this kit it concerned me, but at a price of $3.18 I figured it was worth the risk. After a month of use all the components have worked fine for me so far.UPDATE (1/1/2013): I'm still using this kit. Everything still works."
1,Do NOT buy this item!,"The fact that this company had the audacity to actually describe this as a charger kit for iPod is beyond my belief. After waiting for this item to come in the mail for nearly 3 months - yes, three months - I take it on a trip with me and it is ""incompatible"" with my iPod. At least that is the message that appeared on my iPod screen. It did not even fit snug into the iPod. So irritating and disappointing. I guess I have learned that you get what you pay for. And to think that Amazon would continue to sell this product and deal with this seller. UPDATE: This charger basically fried my iPod nano and it no longer works at all. Whatever you do - don't buy this product. And don't trust Amazon to help in a situation like this either. Very disappointing."
1,Do not buy apple,"Does not charge my ipad, cables work with apple power supply. Power supply works with my phone. Must be a slight variation in voltage? or something the ipad detects. So I guess it was worth the low price for a spare cable & cell phone charger."
2,USB iphone charger,I sent the seller two notices that the cord did not work for this item and never received a response. The car charger and wall unit work but the cord does not work. I am able to use my IPhone cord with the charger plun-ins but really needed a second cord.
1,HAVE NOT GOT PRODUCT YET,"STILL HAVE NOT RECIVED THE PRODUCT, ORDERED ALMOST A MONTH AGO. SO I GIVE IT A BAD REVIEW.HOPE IT WILL COME ONE DAY!!"
1,have not received yet,"i have not received it yet, maybe in one more mounth check back with me and then we'll see how i rate the item"
1,"ATTENTION!!! VERY SLOW SHIPPING, SHIPS FROM CHINA",I still haven't gotten this product even though It has been a month since I have ordered it and the order page said it shipped.I am getting frusterated with not recieving my product that I ordered. If anyone is wanting to order this product it would be better to buy in a store even if it is more expensive. That way you know you have and YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT A MONTH TO TWO MONTHS FOR BASICALLY THE SAME PRODUCT.
1,USB Travel Kei with charger for Apple IPod,"I can not review this BECAUSE I have not received it, it has been over three. I am not happy."
1,Cord,My plug nvr came I gave the people the wrong zip code an I didn't know how to hit cancel when it was already shipped out o dnt wnt it any more now
4,handy items for overseas travel,"The most useful for this traveler with an Ipod, Ipad and Iphone were the car charger and travel adapter cable. They turned out to be particularly handy for charging these items in the UK. Most British vehicles still have a 'cigarette lighter' socket so you can use it to avoid carrying one of those heavy adapters for overseas current. And the clever cable arrangement (with retracting wires) is easy to store in the smallest glove box. I keep my set handy (and out of sight) in my car at home and so am rarely out of a charge on my Iphone.The usb connection to the wall plug allows you to connect many different kinds of usb items to a US outlet.note: a fitted case might be a helpful and more attractive alternative to a small plastic bag, but a bag works just fine, keeps things together and takes up no room at all."
1,Cheap price cheap quality,"I was excited about this purchase because I really needed a charger for my ipod. However, I only used it for a little over 2 weeks when it broke. It was only a few dollars but then I had to go out and spend more $ to replace it. Overall..not happy."
1,You get what you pay for,"Neither the wall or car charger work for the iphone 4. The iphone 4 will recognize that it is plugged into the charger but would keep beeping that a charge was starting, but never charged. The car charger would make my iphone 4 shut complete off after about 5 minutes. You get what you pay for... don't buy"
1,It is so-so,"It works, but the connector is not as good as the Apple's cable. ]The product that arrived to me is not the same of the picture. The cable has a roll-up/retrieve mechanism in the middle.This can be one advantage, as it is compact when not in use.I do not like to press the side buttons to release it from my Itouch 4."
2,charging kit,"I bought two Ipod charging kits. One of them works fine, but on the other one the cable does not work. I have another cable so it's no big deal. For the price I can't justify sending it back."
3,"Everything works fine, products could be a little better quality.",I feel like this wall charger doesn't charge very quickly. I was looking for a rapid wall charger. The last one i had charged my ipod so quickly. The other thing that I don't like is the retractable part. sometimes it doesn't retract very well and my ipod will fall off of whatever it's on. But other than those things everything is fine.
4,Works Fine (Great Buy!),"This generic set works fine with my Ipod Touch 2g. I've only had it for a couple of weeks but so far so good. I would have given it five stars instead of the four stars that I'm giving but the usb cable you get is not the one that's in the picture. Instead of a normal cable, I received a retractable cable. I ordered this set because I thought I would be getting a normal usb connecting cable like the one shown in the image. The description doesn't say anything about a retractable cable, either. I mean, the retractable cable is fine but I already have one of those and I don't want another one because it's a lot shorter than the normal cable even when it is fully extended. Oh well, everything works great and the price is so cheap (especially compared with apple-brand accessories) so I'd still recommend this! Just know that you'll get a retractable usb connector instead of the regular long one."
4,"Light duty, but adequate for the job.","The price seemed too good to be true, and to an extent that would be correct. They are very light duty, but they do the job and that's all I need for occasional use. Who knows how long they will last, but I'm not out much if they fail, and it's a lot better than spending $20+ at Walmart for only one part of the threesome."
2,It works...,"My expectation w/ it is not that high. So, I like it. Highly recommend to anyone who does not want to spend $$$$ to get high-end to do simple job - charging iPod from outlet."
2,Charger,"Doesn't charge my iPhone quickly, the ripcord does not lock into place when extended, for the price it does it's job"
1,Caused my phone to get broken!,"This stupid charger retracts by itself!!! BEWARE! You plug in you iPhone, set it down and it retracts...Happened to me and caused my screen to break! Also, it does not fit through opening of OtterBox, Had to take Otterbox off to charge!"
3,"Not the Best, but it will do","Just like others who have bought or are considering buying this, I only did it because of the price. Of couse the quality is nothing like apple or AT&T (my cell provider), but it does o.k. I mostly use the car charger portion and sometimes it acts like it has a shortage in the line , but mostly it does the job. It charges slow but keeps my phone from dying when my battery is gone."
1,awful,mine never came in the mail waste of money even if their at a good price i only have it a str cuz they wudnt let me put no stars
2,SHIPS FROM HONG KONG!,"First off pay close attention to the shipping time frame. It took FOREVER to arrive, which when it got here and I saw that it shipped from Hong Kong, I was not as surprised. BUT I was disappointed. The part that plugs into the phone won't fit with my cover on, but at least I could plug my other cord into the car charging attachment. However, it smells like that cheap electronics smell and after reading some of the other reviews I'm a bit nervous to actually use this as I don't want to damage my phone. For the price I paid it's not worth it to return it, but I think i should have spent more to get something more reliable. ALSO I definitely think it should have said somewhere that this was shipping from HONG KONG!"
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER,"I HAVE YET NOT RECEIVED THE PRODUCT, IT HAS BEEN MORE THAN A MONTH AND FEW DAYS, HOW LONG YOU CAN WAIT !!! REALLY DISAPPOINTING TO SEE SUCH SELLERS ON AMAZON."
1,NEW....not!!!,"This was supposed to be a NEW product and a Christmas gift. It arrived a week after Christmas and all 3 pieces were just tossed into a shipping envelope. The item was not in any type of factory packaging. I realize I didn't have to pay much for this, but come on...be truthful on your descriptions of your products. I was too embarased to give this as a gift with out being in factory packaging. I will never order from this company again."
2,.....,I ordered this and it said 3-5 day shipping. I orderedvthis december 18th and I got it january 18th. Come to find out...it comes from hong kong! Was chinsey and tacky. Not happy!
5,Works. Not a problem.,"I haven't used this in the car yet, but it plugs into the wall and computer just fine. It works like you would think. When undoing the cord I didn't know how to get it back together. So my sister pulled it farther and that worked. Not a problem with this product. It's one of the better ones I've seen."
5,"Great for the price, get this.",I was ambivalent as the great price. I am so happy I'm buying two more for my kids. Can't go wrong.1/26/2013..STARTED A FIRE IN MY CAR.
1,ipod chargers,gift for xmas fell apart the first time my daughter used it. not impressed. never had problems with amazon before
2,iphone chargers - not recommended,"Wall unit works fine but cord is short. Car charger retractable cord is handy, but for some reason it restarts my iphone after a short time, right in the middle of a call! Not recommended."
1,Car Charger broken,"This product is very cheap, both in price and quality. The USB cord works, but the part that goes into the iphone is so big I have to take off the case to make it fit. Also the car charger had a broken insert slot that you put the USB into and I couldn't fit the cord into it at all. The only thing that was satisfactory was the Travel Adapter, but the whole reason I got this kit was for the car charger, as buying one from apple costs $20-30. Well I guess I get what I pay for. Oh last but not least, it took over a month for me to receive this product. What a big waste."
1,This SUCKS,When I got it in the mail it was BROKE! I tried plugging it in and the thing shot together and messed up my ipod. It sucks. I would tell you NOT to buy it. It is cheap AND is not what is shown up there.
1,never send it to me,"It has been 2 month I still not received yet Where is my order, but they said they mail it to me."
3,Not for Iphone 3g,"This looks like the product that I bought, except for the USB cord. The one I ordered was the the one with the retractable USB cord (which I think is the best part of the package, it is a very big space saver with its retractable capabilities). I found out that the wall adapter did not work to charge my Iphone 3G. The car charger on the other hand, did work. I think I should of read more about the description, I think this was for an Ipod."
1,Item not yet received after more than two months.,"Still waiting for receipt of this item. It has been more than two months since order. There has been enough time to gather raw materials, ship them to plant, manufacture the items, and ship them to me on the slowest method available."
1,Still have not received,Been waiting for over a month. Starting to wonder if it's coming at all. No happy. I don't know where to go to track it down.
1,Not genuine!,"If I could have given zero stars on this one I would have! My daughter's iPod will not work with anything other than an apple charger. I expected this product to be a cheaper alternative, but it turns out to be entirely useless. Just be warned that you should make sure that the product is not generic when purchasing!"
3,WORKS GOOD,Its made cheaply but it also was only 1.00. Works great havent had any problems. I ordered 2 to have for standby chargers at work and in the car.
4,1Amp max means the charger must output 1AMP - IMPORTANT,A lot of people have done this and I've tried it with multiple deals - I would say before you buy a charger make sure it's a USB 5V charger with a max (I would recommend 1 Amp output.) If it does say this it will work. That's my experience.Otherwise you just plug it in and it won't work. This happens with a lot of stuff other than ipods too!Byron
1,Very bad quality,This is a very bad quality product. Better spend another $10 to $15 and get a better charger. I bought Belkin again and it was really good.
2,Cord is too short,"The cord which plugs into the car lighter opening is too short to use while driving. It does charge the phone but when it rings, it is too short to hold up to your ear and talk. For this reason, I wouldn't recommend this car charger."
1,Worst product ever,"I got this charger and put it in my car. When I went to go charge my phone it didn't work on mine or my daughters! So disappointed! I'll just buy apple products, at least I know it will work."
1,Junk!,This product took two months to arrive. Wall Charger does not work with ipod. Buyer beware. Do not buy this product.
3,You get what you pay for,Product worked. Car adapter broke with in 6 months of use. AC adapter is fickle with its abilities but generally works with some patient adjustment.
1,"Don't bother, waste of money","Ordered USB Travel Kit with Car Charger, Travel Adapter & Cable for Apple iPod from Lucky Electronics. the product arrived after 3 weeks just to find out that it didn't work. waste of time and money! An year ago, I ordered a similar product from a different vendor (same price) that works perfect. Unfortunately, the idem was out of stock at this vendor."
2,USB $2.85,"To Whom It May Concern,I thought the $2.85 price was a little bit to worry about and indeed it took longer to arrive since it came from Hong Kong and not surprise the quality was not very good.. Cary"
1,all parts of this product do not work,This is the second time I have ordered this type of product and each time I have had a problem. Either the car charger works but not the wall charger or vise versa. The USB has worked both times but unless your car has a USB port this will not work in your car. If you have another car charger that allows you to plug into its USB port it will work. I plugged my ipod into the wall for 3 hours and it never got out of the red so that is how I know the wall charger was not working properly.
2,What you would expect at the price,"Received and was inexpensive. wall charger did not work but car charger and cable do. Not worth the trouble of returning, just using the computer to charge now"
1,No Follow Through,Would not know. Second half of order never even arrived. Would not recommend ordering from this group. If I could rate a 0 I would.
2,Didn't last,"I bought this for my daughter with her Ipod, within 2 months the travel cord broke in 2 places. It wouldn't wind up after just a few times. The outlet plug and the car charger work fine. But we are using the apple cable."
3,its not that bad,the wire is kinda short and the car charger doesnt really work its a on and off thing...but the plug in the wall charger is great...so i give this product 3 stars
2,didn't work in the car,"We have an iPod 4th gen and this wouldn't charge it in the car. It did work for my husbands iPhone 4s, so I'm not sure what isn't compatible."
2,you get what you pay for on this one,"Here is the thing, I am not disappointed at the price point. But, it is cheap. The retractable cable never worked with any device. The plug works, but only with iPods, not iPads. The car charger works, but breaks easily. So, two out of the three items kind of work. Like I wrote, at this price point, I knew it would be cheap, but I expected the items to work. The plug, that did work, still works a year later."
1,Cheaply made,"The cable is very flimsy and broke soon after purchase. I still use the wall and car adapters with other USB cords, but the one included was garbage."
4,OK for a cheap set,"I've been using it for more than a year with no problems, but I've a situation where no stress is put on the cord which is extremely light-weight. Everything works though, and without problem. You can't always say that about such inexpensive things."
3,few glitches,"the car charger piece didn't work so i had to get another piece to plug into my car cigarette lighter, but the rest of it worked fine. i liked how the cord would hide away when i wanted it to. however, be warned CERTAIN CELL CASES will not work with this plug, you might have to take your case off to use it and in some situations that's too much work. lifeproof boxes and otter boxes will not work."
2,"Some work, some don't","I purchased one of these about 1 1/2 years ago, and it is still working perfectly. I recently purchased a second for my wife. It never worked at all. Still at this price, maybe 50% isn't bad."
3,Rating,It's fine it works ok I like the retractable cord it's neat.I would definitely recommend it to somebody. I am very pleased
1,not for ipad 2,"The car adapter and wall adapter does not charge my ipad 2. It Will work with a charging adapter for ipad, though."
3,Should use the same charging time as through a computer,"Althought the data cable seems to be of good quality, while trying to charge my dead Ipod it took the whole night and a couple of additional hours for it to get at its maximum, so nothing like the 2 hours of speed charge or 4 hours of complete charge stated by Apple when charging through the USB port of your computer. I think it should behave the same way if it was manufactured for this purpose."
2,Junk.,Pretty junky---the kit will run your ipod but NOT charge it. Don't waste your money. It is shipped from Hong Kong--so be prepared to wait a long time if you decide to throw your money away.
4,ipod charger review,I was absolutely delighted when my items were sent to me and arrived about 3 days earlier than expected. They arrived in perfect condition and worked very well.Thanks!
1,Useless,Simply does not work with my my iphone 3gs. Says not compatible on the iphone when I plug it in and attempt to charge it. It's useless to me.
5,Great for the car!,I bought this to keep in my purse for emergency charging of my sons Ipod touch. Everything works properly but you need to use care because these less expensive products are not that durable in my opinion. For the price I would definately recommend this product.
3,Kurt1946,"Cheaply made, but effective. They were gifts tomy grandchildren who lose items more often thanthey wear them out."
4,"Not the highest quality, but can't beat it for the price!","This product works just great out of the package, and was a super value for the price. Obviously, the plastic parts are a little flimsy, so I'm not sure how much wear and tear the parts can take. But the price was so great...so hopefully with gentle handling I can get a year's use out them."
1,lousy product,I ordered three and one of them came broken. The others were fine but not great. You get what you pay for.
4,USB Travel Kit,Had to get a replacement USB cable for my son. This was 90% cheaper than Apple cable and works great for data and charging. Haven't used the car adapter yet.
1,"Cheap Copy, Not Worth It!!",It is cheap copy of original products. I-pod cable doesn't attaches to at all and USB charger is to lousy and keep on disconnecting. This product is not worth enough to be bought.
2,Disappointment :/,"I was so happy when I received my charger, but 3 days after purchase things went wrong. The wires inside of the USB plug in where showing already and very visible. I then decided to see if it would work still ,but when i plugged it into one of the connectables (one for car) my Ipod didnt even show the charging symbol. That's when I knew that it was unusable and now I see why all this product was cheap!I Was Very D I S A P P O I N T E D !"
1,Not received as of yet,"I can not review the product because I haven't received shipment yet, still waiting.I am waiting for shipment it should be here before the 14 of February."
4,Work fine,both wall and car charger work fine for me. there not high quality but do the job. the cable is a retractable one decent for vehicle use. if u need something cheap these are ok.. but spend around 10$'s and get a Duracell kit. i used these on a ipod touch 2nd and 4th gen.
1,Have not recieved,I still did not get it ordered from beginning of JanuaryThis is the longest I had to wait for something
1,Beware!!! Does not fit!!!!,Adapter would not fit my ipod touch.Not much else to say about it since I can't use it. It did seem to be made rather cheaply though.
1,USB travel kit and car charger,I have not received the USB travel kit and car charger. They were for IPods that I purchased for my son and husband as Christmas present.
1,Doesn't even work!,I do NOT recommend this item to anyone! It does not work! My advice is spend a little more money and buy a charger that will actually charge your device! I wish I could give this item lower than one star!
1,not working,It worked once but will not work again basically junk will not buy again. I do not know why they keep selling them
4,"multi-function items, long time to receive","I got 2 sets of the iPhone adapter pieces for myself and to have an extra.The items arrived w no problems, but it just took a long time. Items rec'd as described. Don't order from same vendor if you need parts immediately! But I would recommend them if you didn't need them right away!"
1,Still waiting!,I ordered this item in November and still have not received it....I am starting to get concerned as It is now January 1st. I am not sure who to contact in regards to this.
3,"It works somewhat, but not fully","I got this for less than three bucks shipped, so I won't be too hard on it. Nevertheless, it behaves rather strangely. I use it to charge m iPod nano in the car's cigarrette lighter and in a computer via a USB port. In both cases, it does charge a first, but if I play while charging, my device actually loses charge while this thing is charging! I've used another iPod car charger before and it never had this problem. YMMV."
3,My review,Very good product I recommend this gives you what you want on the go and at home so again I very much recommend this item
1,Car Charger not working,The car charger arrived to my door dead! It was not working at all after waiting close to a month for it!
2,Didn't wok for my iPod in my car,This item dosent work especially in my car doesn't want to take imitations my iPod give me a mesaje saing it dosent below to this iPod I didn't send it back becose I will pay more.
3,Ipod Cord,"The product received was not exactly what was shewn in the picture, but it will work. The one that we got is on a retractable wheel so it is more compact. There are no functional problems with it, it just is not what is shown in the picture. The two chargers that come with it work just fine."
2,.,"product description was not accurate for the product I received. I thought I was getting something completely different and when I tried to return it, I was told I can only return it if it does not work, and it does work but only for what I didnt think I was getting."
