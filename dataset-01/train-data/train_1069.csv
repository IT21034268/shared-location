1,Bad,"I tried to keep an open mind, but the fact is that this is just bad music. Jewel is one confused artist who has hit rock bottom. Hopefully this album will bomb and she will learn from her mistake."
1,Wish it was possible to post a zero star rating...,"This album is an insult to Jewel's talent plain and simple. Listening to this trash is as pleasant as rubbing a cheese grater across your ears over and over. If you have any musical taste, you will hate this album."
1,"Dear god, Integrity???? or does that no longer exsist?","The only thing worse than this garbage is her defense of it,"" I'm a product "". I want an exchange baby."
1,Don't Bother,"Maximum of 1,000 words for the review? That's easy. I could do it in 2 words: don't bother. But, since I do have more space I'll add that this is nothing than a transparent attempt to have a hit. There's barely a glimmer of the Jewel that you fell in love with ages ago who spoke from her heart."
1,What is Jewel thinking?,"THIS C.D. IS AWFUL. There is enough of this dance [stuff] in the world as it is. I used to look to the likes of Jewel to give us some music that was real and made me feel that at least there is still hope for proper good music. I was looking forward to more guitar based country/folk/rock from the one musician I thought I could rely on. Everything up till now was just getting better and better but this is a total let down. I suppose the higher you get the more painful it is when you finally fall. She has sold out. I am sure she is wealthy enough to not need to go down this populist route. I hate to say this about someone I do still admire but I hope this C.D. totally bombs then Jewel might realise how offensive this C.D. is to those who put her where she is today. Her disc buying, gig attending fans. I will look forward to her next C.D. but this time it will be with caution and not with the usual joy."
1,Jewel is a Sell-Out,"This is quite possibly the worst CD ever marketed. Jewel used to be an inspirational folk singer who far surpassed all the ""poptart princesses"" like Britney and Christina.Now... she is simply one of them. A sell out. Where did Jewel go? This CD is horrible. And I used to be a huge Jewel fan..."
2,This isn't a Jewel album...,"This album is just ok. It's got some catchy bits here and there, but if you buy this expecting more of the stuff that made you love Jewel in the first place, you'll be disappointed.The album is very ""dancy"" and seems to blend in with all of the other contemporary albums in its genre. ""0304"" is unlike anything Jewel has done before and, while I can give her credit for trying something new, it's just not the style Jewel has mastered - instead, it's seems to be a style Jewel is taking a stab at. To me, it sounds a bit forced. Try it before you buy it.[Edit: 5 Years Later]Things have certainly changed! This album really grew on me and, inexplicably, I consider it one of my favorite Jewel albums. Amazon won't let me edit the star-rating, but I'd give it no less than a 4, probably a 5. I still think it's good advice to try before you buy though because, despite my sudden approval, it still may not be what you're expecting.[/Edit]"
2,A huge disappointment,"I miss the old classic, genuine Jewel. My favorite thing about her was that she wrote her own music and created the quality sound herself--it wasn't from some manufactured machine that a studio [pushed] out. However, her new ""techo/pop/dance"" CD uses a throbbing beat with what may be her own lyrics, and I find it annoying and disappointing.She is a very talented vocalist as well as song-writer and I wish she would have continued to use her skills on this new CD. Instead, she has allowed someone to attempt to make her famous (as he did Shakira and Enrique), in what has become a typical formula to create a ""pop diva"" rather than simply music. This image doesn't suit her and I don't like it at all.She was much more enjoyable as an acoustic artist who had something to say and a unique way to say it."
2,Where's the Jewel we fell in love with?,"I have been a fan of Jewel's since ""Who will save your soul"". Like everyone else, I waited impatiently for the release of her second album that seemed to take forever. I just don't think she stands out anymore, now that she sounds like everyone else. Listening to this cd reminded me of my Tiffany album when I was in junior high. In her earlier albums you could hear the emotion in her voice and you could feel what her lyrics were about. Now her messages are overpowered by digital noise. I love a good dance song as much as the next person but this new format just doesn't do her music justice. I hope she knows that there are people out there who would still buy her albums even if she just sounded like Jewel."
4,"a nice little album, a couple of really good songs","This is Jewel's 5th album (one was a Christmas album). While her previous albums have had more of a folk sound to them, Jewel decided to go in a different direction with this one. Jewel really wanted to make a pop album (despite the pop-sized sales for her other albums). This is it. It really does have a very different sound to it than her other albums (This Way and Pieces of You are my favorites of the previous 4).I like several of the songs on this album quite a bit. ""Intuition"", ""Leave the Lights On"", and ""Sweet Temptation"" are definite highlights for me. Jewel did make a good pop album, but I'm not yet certain that any of the songs will have a lasting memory that songs from earlier albums did. I don't know what other critics are saying about the album (probably mixed reviews, like always), but I am enjoying listening to it. 0304 does not stand up to the level of Pieces of You or This Way, but it is a fun little addition to Jewel's library."
1,"Sorry Jewel, You're Not A Popstar","0304 sees Jewel cross-over from her folk-country roots to pop. Laced with heavy beats and keyboards, this album fails to ignite and feels labored and intense. Whereas, Jewel excels in organic music with beautiful storytelling, this album really is a step in the wrong direction for her. Her beautiful voice gets lost in production with only the moderately successful 'Intuition' making any mark on the listener. I love Jewel but failed to find anything in this piece of work that inspired me. A disappointing affair overall. I think that she will look back on this one with regret."
2,The best thing I can say...,"The best thing I can say about 0304 is that Jewel's kept her lyrics. Whatever happened to the Jewel I grew up hearing? The one with the acoustic guitar? Why does everyone have to try to out-Britney Britney? ""Becoming"" is quite reminiscent of the old Jewel, and ""America"" is a slightly more modern version of ""The New Wild West."" These two songs are what keep 0304 from being a 1."
2,This album does not stand the test of time,"I'm really tired of this album now. It's been out about a year, and it has fallen out of rotation (something that Jewel's other albums never seem to do with me). Her assertion that the slick commercialization of her image was all part of the 'joke' wears thin when you hear ""Intuition"" on a razor commercial. All of this has probably done irreparable harm to Jewel's career."
1,What happened? Sellout . . . . ?,"I feel Jewel totally abandoned her folk roots with this horrible CD. It's ""techno"" beats and horrible song arrangement give me a headache. The fact that the actual CD is pink should be a sign to everyone that it is POP! Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against pop. I like good pop, but this is bad pop, horrible pop. If she thought that ""catchy lyrics"" and skanky clothing would improve her image, then she was definitely wrong. She turned on her fans and made one of the worst albums of all times."
2,"Um, Jewel, what happened....you used to be good","Jewel has a beautiful voice which she basically wastes on these extremely corny lyriced, nearly nauseating songs. There are only a few good songs on this CD, and the second half of the CD is revolting. I wish Jewel would go back to her folk music, which was real and worth listening too. Now, I blush at her banal, embarrasing lyrics, and disco worshiping beats. It is a shame, really."
2,i can't believe it...,"i haven't heard every song from this album, but i have just one thing to say ""what happened to the country bumpkin that we all fell in love with."" i much prefer the days when Jewel was still doing Pieces of You and even Spirit. but this new deal she's got going on, i don't know. i really don't like how she's changed to another one of those manufactured pop girls. it's just horrible. Jewel what happened!?"
5,*Jewel Sparkles*,"Okay, here's the thing>short and sweet and to the point>any TRUE BLUE Jewel fan will *L-U-V* this cd>regardless! And, please don't compare her to Britney Spears-?! YIKES! Wish I could say this for all my favorite artists-sadly I can't. (For example, after Shania's letdown ""UP"") THANK YOU JEWEL:-)Your new cd is fun, very creative and sexy, which proves there is still hope for(me)>this 40 something year old! :-) ~*"
5,Jewel Sold Out Long Ago -- Thank God,"Many folkies tend to look at pop culture with an acoustic guitar firmly strapped to their heart.As much as open-mindedness has always been a mantra for a bare-bones approach to music, when an album like this comes out, one can see where the opening ends and where the closing begins...If anyone is going to lable any song a sell out, start with Standing Still, but leave Intuition alone..."
3,Duh!,"I am not a Jewel fan, but I must admit to liking some of her songs from the past. I recently saw the video that people were talking about in which they think she is selling herself out by trying to be more mainstream and like Britney Spears and laughed. I give her respect for doing that and this album. I will have to give it a listen, but will do so keeping in mind that there is some pun within the songs."
3,I want the old Jewel back!,"I really like the old Jewel. Now that she has really poppy songs and dosen't play the guitar in this CD I don't like her that much. I went to her concert twice and it was really good, but she didn't sing ANY of the songs from this CD. I love the song Intuition because it isn't as poppy as the other songs. [...]"
1,What have you done?,"What happened to the Jewel we know and love?? Jewel, I never thought I would see the day that you pretended to be a pop princess. Please return to your roots. This is not you and I don't like it. This album is so bubble gum and full of pop sounds that it makes me sick. Why? Why? Why?"
2,Not at all what I expected...,"Listen to a preview before buying this CD. Jewel calls this the ""only record I enjoy listening to"" and ""the one I've always wanted to make"".Perhaps there's a reason that it took her this long to overcome the objections of her advisors... This trite little album sounds like every other piece of dance pop to come out over the last few years. Some may like it, but I suspect many other Jewel fans are going to be disappointed."
5,"REMIXX ""Say you believe""","These two brothers are the best Rythem and Good News singers aroundI have had the pleasure of hearing two of their cd's""Dear Lord"" and ""Say you believe"" and they are timelessPeace,Sandi"
5,Compassionate and loving,"These boys are just the way their mother is. Raised right with a tremendous love that shows in their music. They've truly done themselves, their mother, and most importantly the good Lord proud. I can almost hear God say these are my sons."
1,Not feelin' this,"I recently purchased the Remixx CD from the PX on my Base and I must say I am dissapointed. I support Christian artists to the fullest, and My Fiance is currently working on a project, but for whatever reason this cd did not appeal to me. The Chorus' seemed to have had little or no thought to them, the lyrics and their voices just didnt blend well to me. Nothing against Remixx and their ministry for the Lord, but maybe they might have rushed this a little bit too much. If a song doesnt catch my ear, at least let it paint a picture for my mind.. this CD did neither.For all you who are unsure if this is what you want, try to listen to some tracks first... judge for yourself."
4,A believable obsession,"Where most movies about obsessions fail is in trying to make the obsession believable. Notable successes were the creepy The Collector and the classicPsycho (Collector's Edition), notable failures have includedLolitaand more recently,Lolita.I guess the problem is that obsession is such a perfectly internal state that we have no subtle physical markers for it. So the actor playing the obsessed character has to or tends to end up chewing the scenery to remind us that there is some unusual mental state behind his character's odd behavior.By choosing a marginal character-one whose very vocation has overtones of sadomasochistic fascination, screenwriter Bunel avoids the necessity of writing a cartoonishly weird character and Bruce Dern is free to underplay the part believably.Maud Adams is delicious and the poster may be one of the erotic classics of movie advertising.--Lynn Hoffman, author of New Short Course in Wine,The and the totally believable bang BANG: A Novel"
2,A review,"This review is definitely not thorough enough to pass the exam. Stick the McGraw-Hill book and online documents from IEEE, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, security web sites, etc. Be prepared to see questions on the test on subjects that are not covered in the McGraw-Hill book."
3,Not bad,"I am a little disappointed because the cover of the book I received does not match the advertised picture, but the book is in good shape and should work for my classes."
3,Historically Interesting,"This book is certainly interesting from a historical perspective. As others on this page have pointed out, Keynes' General Theory has had a profound impact on the world in the later half of the twentieth century.I do hope, however, that no one takes it seriously as an economic text. Few theories have been more completely discredited than the General Theory."
1,"Backwards, and Repeatedly Debunked","This book is a lesson in garbage in, garbage out. Keynes starts with numerous false assumptions, and follows them to their false conclusions. Keynes has been proven wrong time and again, not only through the texts of much better economic writers (Hayek, Rothbard, Mises), but also through the plain facts of history.Keynes' book reads like through the looking glass, where down is up, and everyone is drunk at a mad tea party. Keynes' ideas are precisely what will (and already have) lead society to economic failure and misery. The current financial crisis is only the latest in examples of why Keynes was wrong."
1,"Almost as bad as ""Das Kapital""","This book, along with the writings of Karl Marx, is responsible for most of the economic misery of the 20th century. Still, reading this, along with the essential ""The Failure of the New Economics"" by Henry Hazlitt, will give the reader an excellent insight as to why Japan has failed, and will continue to fail, to get out of the moribund economic state it has been languishing in for over the past 10 years."
1,Full of academic claptrap,"I purchased this book to finally read for myself what Keynes actually had to say. I started reading with an open mind but found the writing to be obtuse, and found the theories so riddled with dubious assumptions that they have little, if any, application in the real world. I also cannot imagine this book being used as required reading, or as a textbook, except possibly in a logic class as an example of faulty reasoning. If you are looking for a book on economic theory that can teach you something that you can actually use and apply, I recommend looking elsewhere."
1,This BN edition of Keynes has many errors in the equations,"The BN edition has errors in the equations, errors that make the book incomprehensible. Find another edition of Keynes's General Theory."
1,the kindle version lacks ALL footnotes!,"I bought the kindle edition. It lacks ALL footnotes. chapters like appendix to ch 19, basically makes many of the arguments in the footnotes. They are totally gone. Do not buy the Kindle edition, not at least until you confirm what you are getting."
1,Horribly formatted,"This version is virtually unreadable, due to its terrible formatting, which clearly no one bothered to even glance at after some kind of machine translation from another format."
2,A Poor Edition of a Great Book,"The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money is one of the great works in economics, and is a must read for anyone who pretends to know anything about macroeconomics. But this edition of the book is flawed. Keynes's footnotes are missing! Some of them are integral to understanding the book, so leaving them out is a major mistake. Another reviewer has already complained that some of Keynes's equations were mangled. How could a publisher mangle a great work like this?"
2,Do not buy this edition,"Keynes is pretty great (or at least, inarguably important), but this edition does not include footnotes, which were supplied by Keynes in the original text. If you're bothering to read The General Theory, and are capable of following it, you're probably also a reader of footnotes, so do not buy this copy.Of less concern, though telling, are the various typos that seem to be the result of (I'm not kidding) a bad OCR scan of an original. On page 13, for instance, the word ""ina~tained"" shows up. I'm assuming that meant ""maintained,"" and I think it's implausible that tildes are defensible typos. C'mon Classic Books America--at least use spell-check!"
1,I hate it,"Very bad.Bad qualitty. My advice: do not buy this book.Bad print, errors into the book.I don't like."
1,Two words - Henry Hazlitt,"You can waste your time reading this book, sure. Go ahead. Or, you can pick up Henry Hazlitt's ""The Failure of the New Economics: An Analysis of the Keynesian Fallacies"" and watch as an infinitely more talented writer debunks and destroys Keynes and his faulty logic. Not only does he translate the thoroughly unreadable Keynes, he shows the reader multiple instances where Keynes simply contradicts himself, yet keeps right on chuggin' (savings = investments; somehow in his General Theory, Keynes manages to both prove and disprove this). He explains in lucid terms that Keynes ""General Theory"" isn't ""General"" at all; in fact, it can only be applied correctly in static situations. In most cases it can't account at all for dynamics. Don't waste your time on this piece of socialist garbage."
1,"Keynesian ""economics"" is morally and academically bankrupt",The General Theory of how to economically bankrupt a country through deficit spending and racking up high debt. All for what purpose to replace capitalism with socialism or communism? Instead for fiscal responsibility and social conservatism read Pius XI's On Social Reconstruction and Leo XIII's The Condition of the Working Classes. Vote Newt in 2012!
1,very poor quality,"This book was obviously printed off of the internet then bound and sold. It has text that looks like it was originally a hyperlink throughout the book, and the formatting is all messed up. This is only really a problem where equations are written out as they don't line up and thus are unreadable.The book is also quite big (length/with, not thickness) with a considerable margin around the text.I recommend paying a few extra bucks and getting an official copy of the book. I wish I had."
3,Hard reading - you have been warned!,"Keynes had a great economics mind, but little talent explaing it. The book is very hard to read due to convulated, odd grammer and very long, complicated sentences Keynes uses. The challange is understanding the language, rather than the ideas.A typical sentence/paragraph from the book:""The fact that two incommensurable collections of miscellaneous objects cannot in themselves provide the material for a quantitive analysis need not, of course, prevent us from making approximate statistical comparisons, depending on some broad element of judgement rather than strict calculation, which may posses significance and validty within certain limits.Sure.This is the first book in years I gave up reading in the middle.Until someone rewrites the book for humans - avoid!"
2,Important and Dull,"This book is worth reading for the impact it has and continues to have on economics. For the most part, we still live in Keynesian world. However, Keynes could have used some formal instruction on clarity, his writing is a mess. I found myself laughing out loud to some of the passages in this book. It is a shame because Kenyes was, by all accounts, witty and concise in person. This book is anything but.I would rather read up on the Envelope theorem that be dragged through this book again."
2,No Foodnotes; Errors Abound,"I bought this thinking it would be like all the other versions of this old text. Nope. It looks like they scanned it using a poor scanner, and they also omitted Keynes' own footnotes. Don't buy this version."
1,Sub Standard Printing/Binding - Text formatting is simply amatuer - Public domain print ripoff,"This is simply a substandard print of the book. The bindings, formatting of the actual text, and cover appear as if some amateur bought a digital printer and thought they could make money selling public domain books on Amazon. Pathetic - whoever the seller was should be banned...Leafing through the pages - there doesn't even appear to be a publisher credited. No surprise. Nobody would want there name associated with this piece of junk. The formulas are formatted so poorly you can't even read it - I will throw this away."
4,It is Keynes al over again,Every economist that wants to get some understanding of the current crisis must read the general theory of Keynes. Not only is it highly relevant but also well written.
4,"Classic, but too many typos","This is a classic book. However, the too many typos look like they resulted from scanning in the text and then not proof reading - the publisher does a diservice to the book."
1,Awful Book,"A worthless book. It is nothing but a collection of Steinitz games which you can get from any chess game database. The ""annotations"" are only variations interspersed with the moves of the game. There is no text explaining the approach, goals, strategy, etc. A complete waste of money to buy it and paper to print it. I have about 250 chess books, and I can't think of one I would rate below this book."
4,"<["".""]>","A world so strangely familiar but yet so frighteningly different collapses under the pressure of political and social drama causing Bruce Wayne to pull himself out of retirement to see if his morbidly moral and idealistic way of living can make an impression on a dying world. This is a story about a nation on the brink of chaos calling for it's hero to save it while the hero himself cannot grasp what his purpose is. Bruce Wayne's internal struggle is explosively written and illustrated in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller. This tale travels at break neck speeds through a plethora of different topics and social issues that are relevant and prevalent in our modern society. It's noir atmosphere and one-liner clad pages intertwine with a sense of dark humor to add a ridiculous, almost hyper feeling to the book. The pages themselves are beautifully drawn and colored and the writing is intelligent and humerous."
5,HARDCORE!!!!,"Without a doubt the best Batman story ever told. The final showdown against Superman is mind blowing. Frank Miller is a genius, who captures the true essence of what Batman ought to be."
4,Watching Batman Grow Older Is An Exciting Thrill...,"If you've ever wondered what would happen to Gotham City when Batman ages into an older man, his body less than it was in his youth, then this book will give you a great thrill.It's an interesting perspective of the Batman's future. We always see Batman as a tall, strong, & fairly young man. To see him age gives him a sense of realism and adds depth to his character. The dialogue can get pretty tiresome, especially the scenes of the ""news broadcasts"", but the story is quite gripping. I finished the book the day I started reading it. I recommend this book to even the minor fans of Batman. I was never into comics, but a good story is a good story."
4,Really good,"I had to read this for a class. I enjoyed all of it, except that the story starts kinda slow.Also I didn't like that the author has drawn the president looking like President Regan. He was much cooler and most competent unlike the president character in this comic."
5,What a comeback,"The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller is one of the best graphic novels I've ever read. The story is amazing, although I was left wanting just a little more, but I can understand why the comic had to end there. The art style was a little sketchy, but it in no way took away from the great story. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves Batman or Graphic Novels in general."
4,GOOD BUT...,"This book revolutionized the way we saw Batman back in the 80's. For me this was good, not great. I liked the fact that it portrayed Batman as a dark anti-hero. The narration is told almost entirely through news cast. This can get somewhat annoying when all the anchors talk more than our favorite vigilante. And Robin was an almost pointless. What got this book 4 stars with me was the amazing showdown between Batman and the Joker. All the action in this book is both gritty and intense. I only wish they focused more on Bruce Wayne's personal journey than news casting. This book is not as good as the Long Halloween in my opinion. I believe that is the greatest Batman story ever told"
4,Miller Shines,"I really liked the story here and also the illustration work. To me, this is a critical starting point for understanding the evolution of Batman. Miller does a fantastic job of being a good steward for the character."
5,Great,"This is one of the best Batman books I have ever read, and I've read quite a few. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to have good read...it's also hard to put down once you start reading it."
3,Not the best,"By the time I read this, I had read a few Batman comics. I liked them, but this one wasn't as good. That is just my personal opinion. The whole thing is that Batman comes out of retirement, and the writers did a very good job at showing how his muscles ached and were so out of work that they cramped, and he wasn't as swift or as fast as he had used to be. The comic started to get very boring when they showed newscast after newscast. The interest in this comic went like a roller coaster, up and down up and down. It was a good comic, but too many dry spots that i didn't even want to read, and quite frankly I could have skipped through like 50 pages and still would have known what was going on. That's what I call wasted space. It's all just my opinion, though! If you enjoyed it then I am happy for you!3/5John McAdam:Were Ancient Gods From Other Planets?Am I Mad or Coherent?The Surgeon With GlassesConfucius Say"
3,Pretty alright.,"I thought that this graphic novel would be better. I should probably read it again with lower expectations, but it honestly did have way too much unnecessary dialogue. I'm pretty good about reading lots of font - I'm a Sandman fan - but I found myself losing interest really quickly. Yet, this novel is considered to be groundbreaking and fantastic addition to the batman... collective."
3,"Good Premise, but Average Story","Overall it was a good story, but the Mutants weren't very captivating. Other villains in the Batman Mythos would have made this more interesting. Plus, the whole Batman vs. Superman fight left a lot to be desired. The drawings were good. I didn't think I would like Robin in this story but it was alright. I liked how the Joker was characterized. Just be aware that there are some spots where you think you missed something. The roller coaster ride comes to mind."
4,"Good, but there are better Batman stories out there","This is definitely worth reading, but it is not as good as Batman: Year One (also by Frank Miller). Maybe it is just because I find the beginning more interesting than the end. Whatever the reason, I think both books are must reads for anyone who has ever had any exposure to Batman (Including those who have seen the old TV shows and movies) because THIS is the REAL (as real as he can be) Batman."
3,"Good, but not in the same class as Watchmen.","While I thought this book was different and interesting, I didn't feel it was as groundbreaking as others did. Still good, just not in the class of Watchmen or the Killing Joke."
4,An important and exciting piece of literature,"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns paints an engrossing picture of a future Gotham run amok with gang violence and political intrigue. While its message can be somewhat heavy handed in its application, and I dont think Superman and Batman should hate each other (kinda petty for superheros if you ask me) I would still highly recommend this graphic novel to Batman lovers and and first time comic readers."
5,one of the best pieces of literature,"this book brought back the dark knight after years of of him being a sissy hero, and t was a hell of a comeback. it shows us bruce wayne still against violence, superman a pawn for the government, and the joker the way we've never seen him. Hollywood oughta make a film on this one before it's too late."
3,Reviewing a classic,"After seeing the recent movie The Dark Knight Rises, I wanted to return to an old classic read in my youth. Batman: The Dark Knight Returns was every bit as fresh now as when I first read it. If anything, I am more shocked by the violence and more appreciative of the overall storyline this time around. The comic panels look good via the Kindle Fire, but the overall art work was not as vivid as I recall it to be back in my youth. I great read, all in all."
5,Just looking at it makes me giddy,"Hands down the best comic book ever. Frank Miller is awesome. Art, story, everything. Just thinking about it makes me giddy with anticipation of reading it again.I'm really excited about this coming out for Kindle. I was excited to read this on my iPad via the kindle app, but alas DC has not made much (if not any) of their material compatibile with iOS devices. This is an android-only venture, at least for the time being. And that is very sad."
5,This book is awesome,"I've got each of these books individually and I must say this is one of the best comics ever created. Frank Miller knows how to write a dark and gritty crime tale better that anyone. His art, though simplistic in style sets a dark mood to the whole story. His use of the media tells an effective story. The city scape is breathtaking as usual. Very film noirish in it's portrayl. Miller used the same technique on his run in Daredevil, making the city a supporting character. Some criticize this books art, or the fact he's not your average boy scout in tights superhero. Art isn't really what Miller does best, but it's above average. And the reson batman uses a gun is because after robin died, and he stayed inactive for 15 years, he became even more of a revenge freak vigilante than before. Alan Moore is a better writer, and their are many better artists, but Miller really does now how to write Batman. I just can't wait for the sequal."
5,Chasing the Dragon,"At this writing there are 321 customer reviews about this book. The overwhelming majority of them rating it with 5 stars. It's very likely this review will never be read, but I just had to have my say.This book is so good it will almost ruin your comic reading life. I guess I was 12 or 13 when I first read this and I've reread it maybe a couple dozen times over the years. I've come to regard the book in the way that the first dose of heroin is commonly described. No matter how many graphic novels and how may collected editions I read by any writer or artist about any protagonist nothing has ever made an impression on me like The Dark Knight Returns. The very best of any other comic has only ever been a shadow of this Batman tale.Frank Miller should get a cut of every dollar I spend on comics, since this is the dragon that I'm really chasing."
1,Music so loud you can't hear the dialogue.,Worst DVD ever. The music is so loud you can't hear the dialogue. It should be taken off the shelves.
5,Is it wrong for me to worship Frank Miller as a deity?,"Once Upon a time, in an attempt to relive my childhood ( My first comic ever was ""Elektra Lives Again"", I was seven!), I got, 'Elektra Lives Again', 'The Big Fat Kill' and 'The Dark Knight Returns', all by Frank Miller..In two weeks, I was busy trying to convince my parents to move to a different state so that I didn't have to give 'The Dark Knight Returns' to the library. Its really that good. Dear Publisher, your magesties,PLEASE PRINT THIS BOOK AGAIN!"
5,Great story,"I grew watching the movies, shows, and cartoons but never read Batman comics. This was a great story. I look forward to picking it up again for second read in the near future."
5,THE BEST BATMAN STORY EVER TOLD,"That was what I thought when I read it, years ago. It's arguable that much of the interest in Batman in the last 14 years is directly relatable to the success of this book. As a kid I was a comic book fan, but always Marvel, not DC. The former had revolutionized storytelling in comics by giving their characters storyline continuity, angst, and very real issues. DC meanwhile, still treated its characters about as agressively as the average episode of SUPERFRIENDS. Then in my 20's, I came across this book and observed that, almost overnight, DC figured out how to compete (and eventually surpass) Marvel at its own innovations. Miller's economy of image and dialogue said so much without overworking it. Taking a cue from him, I'll stop here. BUY THIS BOOK!"
2,Glad I'm not the only one,"I'm glad I'm not the only one who didn't like this story. I read the numerous 5 starred reviews at the beginning and began doubting myself, but then I perused the 2 stars and under section and felt a lot better.First off, I LIKE Batman comics, I really do. The only reason I'm not hardcore is because I'm a grad student, and let's face it, I simply just don't have the time (or money). I likedBatman: Year One, and I likedBatman: Hush, Vol. 1, along withBatman: The Man Who LaughsandSuperman/Batman Vol. 1: Public Enemies, plus many more. I'm not a newbie to this world.So when I got TDKR, I figured I'd like it too, right? NOPE. I have the same problem with this comic as I did withBatman: Arkham Asylum (15th Anniversary Edition), only worse. The art is too spastic; the design is too creative; my brain just isn't able to make the leaps in logic that are apparently required to make this all into a storyline that flows in some kind of understandable manner."
2,Overrated,"The first 25% of The Dark Knight Returns is great reading and fantastic story telling. It falls flat by the end - but that's Frank Miller's MO: inability to bring a story to a reasonable close. Overrated, like its pretentious author.Nonetheless, this should be read by comic book fans, but it's certainly not a comic to be used to introduce people to the genre."
4,Way cool,"It's a grippingly-told, amazingly-illustrated novel. If anyone thinks that Batman comics are just for kids, this is the one that will demolish that thought. It's a book that will make you re-examine beliefs and pose questions ... would you like to have a Batman in your town? In your life? Do the means justify the end? What problems can you solve with violence? And perhaps the most important one ... why can't everyone see that Batman is way cooler than Superman?"
3,IMO Overrated,"I think that this was a good comic.. in every sense of the word. It was good, but not great. I wasn't too impressed by the art (VERY important to me when reading a comic) but the story was pretty decent.After a while, the story seemed to drag on a bit, but it was... good. If you're looking to learn more about Batman and want something to read, I would definitely suggest it but this would only come in on the top 10, not the ""best"" like everyone says."
5,Other Books,"Well, it really doesn't get any better than this. I was hooked on hits from the first time I saw the cover image in a comic shop.The news media scenes now, are pretty much right out of today, with screaming pundits on the television, American style.The fascism and violence prompts Bruce Wayne out of retirement. Heartened by the assistance of a young girl, he plans his strategy.He has one major obstacle.Superman, who is now a covert special forces operative lapdog."
2,Probably not what you are expecting,"The art is absolutely horrendous, and it even makes it hard to understand whats happening at times. The story is not as good as people say it is. If you read books or even other comics, i see no reason why you would think this story is anything special. Batman does do some pretty cool and hardcore stuff and that is the only good thing i saw in this book. If you are a fan of unexplained dystopias where (for no explained reason) there are pale people who have spikes that stick out of their skin and nipples and villians named bruno who have exposed butts and boobs with swastickas on them and magical flying baby dolls that spew gas on hundreds of people (killing them) and joker riding on the magic baby's back to freedom, you might like this book. If you like disgusting art that makes every person but batman look deformed and like stories where batman diguises himself as a fat green wart monster, you might like this."
3,Adequate,"The story reminded me a lot of the Watchmen, only less brutal. The art was, at times, adequate. I haven't read the full story yet, but it looks promising. The idea of Batman killing Superman is intriguing. It was just a little too dark for me."
5,Just Fantastic,"This is a great story. So much has been said about ""The Dark Knight Returns"" that I doubt I could say anything original. The book does a great job in addressing the issues facing an aging Bruce Wayne, having retired the mantle of the Batman 10 years earlier, in a crumbling Gotham. If you are a Batman fan, you have to make sure you read this. If you're a comic book fan at all, you should do your best. If you're not a fan of either, but are curious, this is a great book to get you in to with a character that most people are familiar with.Read it."
3,My Review,"I didn't think that this was bad by any means, but it didn't even come close to my expectations.Overall, the artwork throughout the book ranges from very good to excellent. Where I found this book to be lacking was in the dialog and to some extent the storyline. Things just seemed very long and drawn-out and there were times where I was a bit confused as to what exactly was going on. I have previously 300 (another graphic novel by Frank Miller) and it also got me lost a couple of times along the way, forcing me to re-read sections so maybe it's just the way Mr. Miller writes or maybe it still has something to do with the graphic novel medium (although I read a lot of comics as a kid, so I don't think that is my problem.)Either way, I did enjoy the book for the most part. I just don't think that I'm ever going to be one of those people to whom the graphic novel is the best way to go for my reading preferences."
1,I feel [...],"I'll get right to the point. DK2 is a big let down. I was really looking forward to this, but in the end I was disappointed. I won't give away any spoilers, however, readers should know before they lay down their cash that Batman is hardly even in the book. You barely see him in part one, and he is not in that much of parts 2 and 3 either. Superman, his daughter, The Atom, and Catwoman, are in the story more than Batman. Plus the ending was terrible. This did not give me the epic feeling that ""The Dark Knight Returns"" gave me..."
1,only one,There is only one true Batman and everything else is a lack of creativity. Go back to the drawing board.
3,Good but flawed,"First of all, the art in this book is very substandard so I'll focus in the storyline. The story presents us in a Gotham where Batman has retired and crime runs rampart. However, some events urge the Dark Knight to Return in action, and along the way goes completelly mad, and confronts even Superman, resulting his death...or not? The story here is really very inventive, especially when we consider that Batman is a mainstream hero and not underground stuff. However, no matter how good the story is, it is damaged by the really bad drawings. If this book had art by, say, Jim Aparo or better the one who draw Batman: The Killing Joke, it wouldhave been the best superhero comic book of all time. It would be really cool to remake this comic, with exactly the same story but with good art."
5,A classic out of the 80s comic book renaissance. . .,"Frank Miller reintroduced us all to the Batman in the 80s with The Dark Knight Returns. Few interpretations of the character offer him as honestly and powerfully as Miller's, or as consistently. Miller is an inspiring graphic storyteller, deserving of unwavering respect within the comic genre, but demonstrating with The Dark Knight Returns a literary skill that brings the comic medium serious recognition from outside the collector's world and acquaints the non- collector with the realization of graphic storytelling potential as an art."
5,Best Comic Ever written,"Dark Night is the best Mini -Series ever written, period.Only a handful of books give me the feeling of reading comic history as this does. This and Kindom Come to be exact.This willbe remembered for as long as comics exist."
5,"Wow, what a surprise!","I have never been a big fan of Batman, even the T.V. series was very hokey. However, after seeing ""Batman Begins"" on the big screen and enjoying it immensely, I picked up this Graphic Novel. To my sheer delight, it was awesome, what an incrediblewriter and artist, the images are indescribable, a must read!!"
4,Over the top yet subtle,"Their are points in this book that are over the top, like all good superheroe comics. There is also subtle satire. Some parts seem like opera. I could here Wagner's Ride of the Valkries when Batman attacked the Mutants in a tank. Yet, you have many moments that are very quiet. Plus- it proves once and for all that Batman is better than Superman."
5,Best Batman Story,"The Dark Knight Returns is the best Batman story because of the epic scope it potrays. Batman, in Miller's view is the real superman. He is a Neitschean hero who is too big to be judged by normal standards of morality so those who comment on hom in the novel look foolish. This bigness is why Jim Gordon allowed him to operate as he did in his prime and why Ellen Yindel does not try to stop him whenn he tries to bring order to Gotham after the Soviets launch their nuclear weapon.Gotham is transformed by Miller into a truly gothic city for the first time; the movies and subsequent Batman comics are merely copying what he did in this book and the creepiness of the villians only serves to reinforce the epic scale of the book as does the conflict with Superman.This is one of the best superhero coics ever, but I am dubious about the upcoming sequel."
1,Did he really return? Didn't seem like him to me.,"I was extremely disappointed with this book. It is one of the only graphic novels that I have deliberately traded back to the store for credit. I did not recognize the Batman character at all in this portrayal of his ""future self"". The whole novel was about Batman using huge weaponry and little of his cunning to subdue whole armies of evil-doers without any of his original motivations of his parents death. I read it to the end, waiting for a plot twist, or a sudden redemption of the story line, but it simply didn't happen. If you want good Batman, read No Man's Land, Bruce Wayne: Murderer, or Batman: Hush. Now THAT was good writing."
1,A big dissapointment!,"After hearing the great word of mouth, this novel has generated, I was really excited about purchasing this book and reading it. Unfortunately my memory was refreshed on why I can't stand comic books anymore. Everyone has to keep redefining old superheroes; sadly sometimes (like this) for the worst."
1,Batman: The Dark Knight Returns buyer BEWARE!!!!,"Liked this book, however the KindleKindle edition has recently changed its structure on my iPad on how I view this. Cannot view pages, it cuts them ALL off. If you like this book maybe buy it if you have the kindle fire. Would like to have a resend of this book and see if they get it right a 2nd time. Disappointed with amazon on how I don't get t see the whole book/story. Buyer BEWARE."
4,$#%@,"This graphic novel is not the greatest - it is surpassed by ""Watchmen"" and ""Arkam Asylum"". It stands, however, at a cross-roads where the dull-as-a-bunny presentation of Batman (such as we were given in the rediculous television series) is shouldered aside and the psychological madness of the post-modern hero stands forth. ""Dark Knight Returns"" is a tragedy on all levels but the core of the tragedy is the Batman himself who is, essentially, a failure at being a fascist.There is always a link between actual fascism and a parnoia about crime. It is not an accident that tricky Dick Nixon was a ""law and order"" president and it is decidedly not an accident that Ronald Reagan performs caricature cameos in ""Dark Knight Returns"".This graphic novel is three-sheets-to-the-wind shy of true greatness. It is flawed by bad pacing - a sort of choppiness mars the kind of psychedelic flow we really need from the work."
3,Overrated,"There is some great artwork here, due largely by Janson's inking. Depicting violence is what Miller does best.The story is a different matter. For anyone familiar with the ""Adult Legion"" tale from the the Sixties, you'll know what I'm talking about. Because this Batman story is set in the ""future"", Miller had carte blache to do whatever he wanted with the characters. Thus, pivotal charaters in the Batman mythos die in this book. Miller would never be allowed to do such a thing if he were writing the monthly comic. He also puts Batman's current writers in a box if they are to hold true to this story. Any other writer with such restrictions lifted could have accomplished the same thing that Miller did.Miller has Batman ""shoot"" a bad guy, but doesn't really show if the the bad guy is, indeed, shot. Not very brave of Miller. Lastly, Batman teams up with the same group of thugs that a few issues before were murdering people.Such inconsistencies of character are of little concern to Frank."
4,The Re-Defining of An Icon,"Frank Miller returned Batman to his gritty glory with this piece. For so long in the 60's and 70's the Batman had become tame and cartoony. However Batman returned to his dark roots, and Gotham became the concrete jungle it should've been once more. This story also re-defines the relationship between Batman and Superman. The World's Finest Superheroes would never really get along in real life, and this story brought that out in wonderful fashion."
3,Mostly Good,"Stephen King thought highly of Dark Knight. I would value his opinion. The story is a bit over the top at times, and the ending is a pleasing, refreshing take on Batman. On the minus side, the illustration and coloring is way outdated and an annoying eyesore to look at. Still, this is one of those ""classics"" that everyone on their amazon.com guide will tell you to buy. I don't believe that this should be the case though. Check it out at your library first, or borrow from a friend, then decide if you want a copy of your own."
5,Miller's Finest,"A tiny bit better than Batman: Year One, this has to be the best Batman i've ever read. Grim, violent, and hard-hitting, this graphic novel shows that there is no peace in the future of the Batman. A new Robin awaits, along with a new foe in the form of the Mutants, a menacing street gang that threaten to take over Gotham. There are several famous scenes in this excellent series, such as the classic brawl between Batman and Superman, the fairground chase, and the defeat of the Mutant Leader.One tiny little problem with this brilliant work is that Batman is too violent. Almost too villian-ish. Miller depicts him as some kind of prophet to the religion of crime fighting, which makes him seem too gritty.Unfortunately, this outstanding comic was followed by the terrible Dark Knight Strikes Again, which was basically an attempted remake of the style of DKR.SO GET DOWN TO YOUR COMIC STORE."
2,MCGRAW HILLS GED MATH,THIS BOOK IS EVERYTHING YOU NEED. TIM TOOK IT TO A LOCAL TECH COLLEGE TO GET HIS GED AND THEY SAID IT WS COMPLETE AND THOROUGH. I THOUGHT IT WAS A GREAT VALUE
1,Too vague on all areas,"This book was too vague to really explain anything worth learning. It would just start to get into an area that was on the test and wouldn't take that next step.I bought this book for my husband and he did pass on the first try at 31 years old, but he didn't really use much from it. He found reviewing multiplication flash cards was really the key to passing the test.If you are looking for help with the math portion of the GED test, don't bother buying this book. Invest $3.00 in some flash cards from Wal-Mart!"
4,Great item,This item so far has taught me a few thigs about math that I'll need to know for my GED test. Since reading this book I feel more confident in taking the test now.
1,Kindle version review,"I was hoping to be able to order this for Kindle, but you cannot read some of the tables and the font will not enlarge using the feature designed to do this. This probably works better if you have the DX, but I would not recommend for regular kindle. Sadly, I will have to order this in a regular book format."
1,disappointed,"I wish I could see in ""Pinky and Stinky"" what other reviewers appear to, but I can't.Given that the book seems aimed at young elementary school children, it is particularly regrettable that both pigs and humans frequently name-call, referring to one another as ""idiot"" and ""stupid"". The characters don't really have any character, the humor is clumsy, and the plot makeshift at best.Also, there are misspellings (of the words shameful, murmur, and laser)which will mislead kids and make adults wonder why this book wasn't more carefully edited.High quality graphic novels can really reach young readers and offer both terrific stories and artwork. ""Pinky and Stinky"" disappointed on all fronts, and I'm sending my copy back."
5,A Weed is a Flower,"I am a teacher, and was required by the new Core Curriculum to read aloud this book to my first graders. It is a WONDERFUL book. I was so pleased that Amazon had it in stock.Thank you for such wonderful service you provided.Best,Elizabeth Browne"
3,The book that would never end,"Looks like I'm in the minority. Where some of the readers here couldn't put this book down--I did so--repeatedly. At best the whole experience felt unbalanced. Serious and horrible in the begining-which successfully drew me in-then when the hero and heroine met-interesting and clever banter ensued-but then suddenly-the repeated introspection and the left turn at Albuquerque (figure of speech) literally had me dropping off to sleep a few times. The hero's over the top poetic prose had me scrutching my face and shaking my head. The heroine's honor bound promise to Otterbury bordered unbelieveability. With the stakes being what they were, it was best for Prud to marry and then just be guilt riddened for breaking her promise. But whatever-this just didn't do it for me."
3,blah blah blah,"This was way to sappy, I couldn't even finish it. It started out to be a good book,and towards the middle it fizzled. blah blah blah. How could anyone give this anything over 3 stars."
2,"Oh dear, I'm in the minority....again","The book was choppy, with a totally nonsensical beginning. In Regency England, Edwardian England, Victorian England, ....women were chattel, owned by their family. The idea that a total stranger would suddenly sweep four females away from their legal guardian is hard to swallow. Women in pre-Suffarage England could be killed by the men in their lives, have their children stolen away....be thrown in the street. Being beaten by a male in the family was nothing to Polite Society.To be fair, the book did improve significantly toward the middle, and end. Not enough, however, to overcome the fantastical beginning.I found myself far more interested in the quiet Duke, than in the hero of this book. The romance between the quiet, reclusive Duke, and the ""loveliest"" of Prudence's sisters was expected. But, come on........instant? One look, and the Duke was hooked.I finished the book, and promptly pitched it in File 13."
4,A near perfect read.,"I loved 'The Perfect Rake but when I started to feel the book was a little overlong - it suggests something isnt quite right. MS Gracie excels at writing great characters - I loved Carradice and Prudence and the humourous banter between them. It was wonderful how Carradice saw his Imp as utterly beautiful and was mystified that others thought her plain - how romantic is that?Where this book fell down every-so-slightly, was the plot. Whilst there was nothing actually wrong with the plot, at best it was attenuated and at worst a bit thin. If these same characters had been put in a situation of greater tension, this would have easily been a 5 for me.That said, I liked Ms Gracie's style enough to seek out more of her books."
3,"Great films, lackluster DVD quality","A great three-pack, Tim Thomerson as a 13-inch Alien Cop in two of the movies and the joy of John Carl Buechler's talented Demonic Toy creations (in the first Demonic Toys). The only problem I have with this set is the ugly transfer these titles got onto DVD.The quality rivals that of VHS, a VHS tape that has sat on a hot dashboard all summer to be exact. The set does come with a minor ""behind the scenes"" segment that is certainly worth the watch, and Demonic Toys the movie is worth buying the set for.It's truly a shame that just to make a buck Charles Band or Full Moon or whoever just slopped this box-set together without the proper TLC is so rightfully deserves. Shame on you Full Moon-"
3,Underrated Cult Classic!!!,"With a name such as DOLLMAN it's not difficult to understand why this movie never left much of a mark on its genre; however, it still holds up today as a great cult fantasy thriller. Hilarious, and almost clever tongue-in-cheek dialogue, for such a low budget horror film. There is much to be appreciated here. Worth the watch if you're a true fanatic."
5,Seriously,Seriously. These people selling it for 200 bucks are ripping you off! Purchase it at fullmoondirect for like 50 bucks!
4,FULL MOON CREATE'S ANOTHER COLORFUL HERO,"DOLLMAN From Full Moon Video which is now on DVD with it's sequel Doll Man vs. Demonic Toys on a double Dvd purchase is pure gold as far as Charles Band's company was going back in the late 80's and 90's. Tim Thomerson who I was very lucky to meet at a film show told me many stories about the Dollman movies and even told me that he took some of the large Demonic Toys props home that Full Moon gave him to take home to his family who were young children at the time. DOLLMAN mixes science fiction with the cruel gangs of the street on this planet and pits a pint size star with a big heart against giants doing harm to young innocent people.Giants to him because he is only 6 inches high on this planet. Jackie Earle Haley plays the sinister leader of the street gang, and does a great job just being mean.Ok the special effects are not super but the miniatures play well,it's well made and a fun movie from Full Moon. Check it Out.RICHARD J. SPANBURGH"
2,"IT'S NOT A NIGHTMARE, IT'S THE SOUTH BRONX","Tim Thomerson stars as Brick Bardo, the ""Dirty Harry"" of the planet Arturos located 10,000 light years away. Arturos is one of those odd planets with a parallel development to that of Earth, down to the English language with slang. While chasing a bad guy (one that is just a flying head) the enter some undefined force field which causes them to crash land in the South Bronx at a time when chain smoker Kamala Lopez is trying to rid her neighborhood of drugs. Bardo is only 12 inches tall on this planet and instantly gets the nickname ""Dollman"" as he aids Kamala against a gang.If you recall the special effects in ""The Incredible Shrinking Man,"" they didn't get any better for this film. The movie was good on Arturos, but once they come to Earth, it spins its wheels. Not really worth a watch unless all you have are Asylum of Tempe videos.F-bomb, no sex, no nudity."
1,grade B grade B movie,"this movie looks and sounds like it was created in grade school (not high school), production values stink, story stinks, acting stinksall and all I cant believe it made it to amazon."
3,SHINEON REVIEW,"Having purchased a similar Electric Shoe Polisher some fifteen-twenty years ago (Presto ShineOn), I am of the view that the older model is easier to use and offers a better polish and shine as brushes were fashioned downwards (vertical) as against this model where the brushes are horizontal.Your tracking information and feed back was excellent and worthy of emulation. Five ***** (stars) on this!Col. Edison N. Isaac"
3,"Works great, reasonably priced","Nothing beats the professional shoe shine at the airport or hotel, but this is a close second. Just rub it on, buff it off, no mess, no hassle."
3,Works....If you know what you are doing,"Great working machine, when I let friends use it. Shoe polishing is a skill I lack, I was thinking this product would make it easier for me. But it doesn't, please only buy this product if you can already polish shoes. There are no shortcut with this product."
5,Best game ever,More controversial than GTA could ever dream of being this game holds nothing back and you wind up with the most twisted game ever. Amazingly it still holds up and is incredibly playable today with damage modeling I have yet to see done half as well. Hilarious power ups and with three ways to win every level the replayability is outrageous! The only hard part is finding a computer to play it on.
5,Great Gift Item,"I bought a set of these as a gift for my sister for her birthday last year and she loves them. When we visited at Christmas, she served a variety of dips in them along with fresh vegetables and chips for an appetizer. The size was perfect for that use. She also told me she uses them to serve first course cups of soup at dinner.I just purchased a second set today for my brother, knowing he will love them too."
3,"Good Salt, Hideous Price","The salt is good, but OMG, for the price they charge, you'd think you'd get a bag (of salt) that's a bit bigger... I won't be buying any more."
2,awkward to use,"the shapes are really tiny and even the largest ""bone"" makes small cookies. It became easier to just use a round biscuit cutter."
4,Made my Dogs Healthy Christmas Presents,"They worked ""GREAT"", I just thought they would be a little bigger than what they were. A nice way to show your Dogs you love them."
3,Expected better quality,I love the different sizes but one broke the third time I used them. I assume the other two will break soon too.
5,Good product,"When I first saw these I thought that the biggest one maybe too small, but after baking them, they were the perfect size I needed."
3,Overpriced,"These cutters do cut cookies. However, for the price I was expecting a bit more quality. I was wrong. If all you are looking for is very cheap pieces of tin made in China, you are on the right track."
5,do bone cookie cutter set,"When I received this item, I was like What the heck they are so small. I went out and bought a larger one. When it was time to bake I hated the larger one and used the smaller ones. My cookies came out perfect. Just the right size!! I can't wait to use them again!The shipping was fast, and the product is good quality!!"
2,Broken :(,On my 2nd batch of bone treats for my dogs the middle size bone snapped open :( Bummed! I read all the reviews and I was very gentle while pressing....very cheaply made but are able to get the job done.
3,VERY SMALL,"Pay attention to the size of these cookie cutters. I didn't and realized once they arrive that they are VERY SMALL -- too small for what I am trying to use them for. I had to order bigger ones and this one will become a stocking stuffer for someone. I haven't used them, so I can't rate them on performance. However, I am sure they are a fine cookie cutter, if that is the size you want. Happy Baking!"
5,Dog bone cookie cutter set is just the ticket!,"this little set was worth the money...all the right sizes and not a lot of bucks!! I can make ""people"" biscuits and Dog biscuits with these cutters. Small one is pocket size treats and big one for larger dogs...great product."
1,Not so good.,"This product is only good enough for small projects like cutting 22ga sheet metal.For something bigger it really sucks. In fact, the first day of use it was falling apart. All the screws were coming off and it needed constant lubrication to cut every 10 inches."
3,two in a red canoe,"I was looking for a little more specifics, and maybe more pictures of the river. Not a bad book, but does not leave me with a wish to start my own adventure down the Yukon."
4,Not quite a history book,"This book isn't quite a history book, nor is it a book on design theory. While it has aspects of both, it's more like a series of case studies, in which almost 100 designers, magazines, posters, advertisements, icons, types... are analyzed and discussed and placed in a historical context.So if you're expecting a comprehensive book on design history, this is not for you. In no way does it feel complete for a design education. What it does is provide thoughtful pieces to consider, and a perspective on the usage of design, originality, trends, etc. The authors do have a point of view, but it doesn't ruin the book. To the contrary, it makes it even more interesting. Design isn't just art and technique It's grounded in economics, history, culture, and politics. Heller and Pomeroy contribute a useful set of essays to help the reader become more aware of these relations."
2,good but not on time,the book was new as promised but i got it too late though it was 2nd day delivery via DHL.i was upset for the late delivery only but otherwise it was good
5,Every American Should Read This,"Danny Schechter does an incredible job documenting the mainstream media's complicity in cheerleading, censoring and selling the Iraq War. This book will make every American shudder. Turn off the TV, talk to your friends and get involved before it's too late.This book reveals it all! Way to go Danny!"
3,Cute but very small,Yet another cute product from Le creuset. But it is rather small and I dont find many uses for it. Another thing to note is this product is not made in france but made in taiwan. I got it free with another le creuset product and I am not sure if I would have bought it for the 25$ price tag otherwise.
4,Sam the Cat Detective,"I bought this book not realizing that it was a children's book. I read it anyhow, and enjoyed it thoroughly! It has captured the 'tough detective' genre very well and I think that most good readers would like it. Most adults, if they preview what their kids read, would be amused with the take off of the 'Humphrey Bogart type detective'."
4,Sam the cat detective review,"1. There is a cat named Sam. He is a great cat detective. He gets upset when things go wrong, for example, if someone gets robbed. He met his friends along his detective search. One of his friends name is Sugarly. Sugarly helped Sam do detective work and find things out a robbery. She helps Sam make sure that everything is O.K. Sam is a good friend to everyone. Sam is never testy to his friends. Sometimes his friends help him do detective work. His friends are good detectives too. At the end everything gets solved.2.Sam is a good detective. He makes sure crimes get solved. When something goes wrong he does'nt like it.3.Sam the cat detective is a book that I would recommend. It is funny. This is a ficton story because the cat talks. He is a great detective because he makes sure that everyone is safe. If you read this book, it will knock your socks off, that's why I would recommend it."
3,50 ft woman from the 50's,"The special effects are so corny it makes this movie adorable. However, the actors are brillant. They bringthis movie to life."
5,Just A Nice Classic,"I just love this movie, I grew up watch Chiller Threate on TV when I was young, and this movie was one of my favorite, also The Amazing Colossus Man. I have a movie night with some friends, and they were surprise that I had this old classic. Can you bring The Amazing Colossus Man on DVD, I would love to have that in my collection 2.Thank YouMs. B"
5,The original is always better than the remake.,"I dont know why they waste alot of money making remakes of movies that were already good to begin with. Like the remake of this one with Daryl Hannah. Im sorry, I find the older original versions much better. Allison Hays Did a splended job playing the part of the giant. I think the movie industry waste too much money. Why dont they use the money to come up with something new? Instead of wasting it on something that was already done and done good to begin with."
4,The Big Girl on DVD...WOO-HOO!,"Attack of the 50ft. Woman on DVD...FINALLY! This is one of those films that as a child, was a lot of fun because it would actually scare me. Now as a 48 yr. old kid, it's still a lot of fun but on a totally different level. Sure the effects are bad, the acting isn't the greatest, blah, blah, blah, but I have to admire all the reviewers who love this movie for what it is...good campy cheesy sci-fi fun! One reviewer mentioned that this would have been a good film for the MST creators to get their hands on. Well, I actually saw this movie at a revival theater where they played the movie but a comedy group (the Laugh Connection, the American Connection...can't remember), provided their own soundtrack and dialog. It was one of the funniest things I've ever seen! They completely changed the story but it still worked with the visuals.Long story longer...I love this film and this kid is looking forward to seeing it again and again."
1,These are not real movies.....,real Movies have great casting and scripts to work with. None of these B-movies have any of that. They are not even scary. They are just so badly made and it;s no wonder that few if any of these actors ever found work again.
4,"""POTUS does a cameo!""","Is it my imagination, or is the giant from outer space that our protagonist encounters a dead ringer for Dwight Eisenhower? After all, it was the 50's! Maybe that was Dwight's version of Nixon's famous ""Sock it to me?"" on Laugh-In."
3,"Where are you, Bert I Gordon?","Originally I was eager to watch these films since I'd only known them from their amazing posters (especially Attack of the 50 Ft Woman). Was I wrong. The big problem is that whatever this films lacked in budget, they didn't try to make it up with good weirdness. Even at 65 minutes Attack of the 50 Ft. Woman drags. Giant Behemoth lacks the monster action needed to make it work for me. Queen of Outer Space.All of these films could have been helped if they were made by Bert I Gordon."
2,Laughed 50 times hard at it,"All fifties sci-fi is not good and Allison Hayes made better use of her seductive beauty in Disembodied and The Undead. A gifted pianist with legendary attractiveness, her talents were short-changed with this effort. It was a childhood favorite of mine, but maturity makes me see the rediculous special effects, plot holes, and bad acting. A giant paper mache hand is all it takes to make the nurse scream in pure terror. Our giant in one scene appears to be door top level tall when she walks toward the tavern. And so, thin as the plot is, why does the sheriff and the butler need to follow giant footprints alone out into the desert to see the alien giant? They should alert the Army and the National Guard first! Nathan Juran, an Oscar winner for art direction in How Green Was My Valley, directed using the name Nathan Hertz. Ouch! Directing a flop like this must have."
2,Classic Schlock!!!!,"Could this be the first ever women's lib film? Spaceship crashes in the outskirts of town, and ""radiation"" causes Allison Hayes to grow, and grow, and grow...until she reaches the size big enough to destroy the town and all the men in it, including her philandering husband. Great campy, popcorn-on-a-Saturday-night flick for its ineptitude and very bad special effects.Fun stuff."
1,Pathetic Camp,"I remember loving this film as an 8 year old kid. I should have left my fading memory of this film in childhood. But No-o-o-o!!!, I had to buy it on DVD. I fully expected to laugh at the campiness of this cult classic, but instead I cringed at every moment. How bad can it get? Pretty darn bad, I'm afraid. The ""special effects"" were far worse than I ever remember them being. For starters, the alien man was nothing more than a super-imposed glowing figure in which the scenery from behind him bleeds through, the same holds true for Nancy when she becomes the 50 foot woman. Before that, the appearance of her paper mache & rubbery hand is so awful, and it's mere size makes you wonder how the rest of her body can still fit in her bedroom..LOL!!! When she grabs her cheating husband Harry from the nightclub he looks like a Raggety Ann doll. Need I say more? Only for true die hard ""bad cinema"" fans. Glad it wasn't an expensive buy. I'm still shaking my head...."
5,Attack of the 50 FT Women,One of the greatest B movies Ever . Allison Hayes is stunning as Mrs Archer.Great special FX. Thumbs up. A must for all B movie buffs.
3,"So hokey, but I love it...","Having watched this as a kid, I was intrigued to see it again. I have seen clips in recent times at Disney's SciFi Drive In! It doesn't have the same impact on you but it is still a lot of fun to watch."
4,Cult Camp Classics 1,"We love it!!! Disney's Sci-Fi Dine in is our favorite restaurant and we've made it our ""quest"" to acquire all of the films whose trailers they screen and this is a good start."
2,Attack of the 50ft Woman...er...for 15 minutes anyway,"Although a weak movie in it's own right, it is actually a B-Movie classic. Allison Hayes is perfect for the towering Nancy Archer on the rampage in search for her cheating husband, Harry. But the actual 'attack' is only at the last 15 minutes of the film and Hayes barely scratched the actual city and just scares people off. As many people have heard, the special effects are an absolute joke, what with the huge rubber hands and when Hayes, with all her strength, picks up...er...a cotton woll doll (which was meant to be Harry). The movies not really worth buying but may be worth recording from the TV."
5,Groundbreaking,"A fanatastic band, as good as any band from the punk era. A great CD of songs, with alternate mixes and a live recordings to boot."
1,TLC store provides all missing footage don't buy this DVD anywhere else,"I'm writing this review to warn people that want all the episodes in Season 5. The TLC store says on their website that they have all the bonus episodes exclusive to their site only. I went with TLC store and I have all the episodes that many say they are missing when they buy other places. The worst episode left off I heard is the Season finale the last episode.Which I have on my Jank Season 5 DVD I bought mine from the TLC store if you want all the episodes you should do the same.I made the mistake of buying 17 kids and counting from Amazon expecting the 4 bonus episodes from the Duggars very first TV appearances my favorite episodes actually and i was disappointed to find them missing So i ended up having to re buy it! on the TLC store website (those were the only episodes i really wanted) I don't have that kind of money lol who does "":) buy it at the TLC STORE get your moneys worth"
1,Why do people like this show now??,"I dont get why this has good reviews. They move into this huge expensive mansion, pretending to be so much in love still.....but the marriage is over!!!! The kids are in background. All this is faked just like watching a soap opera. After only watching a couple of episodes I quit watching. I won't give my ratings to money hungry people who pretend they do everything for their kids, but in fact they are using their kids to make money. Kate is real mad now cause her ratings are dropping. Everyone is seeing her for what she is!!!!! good monther my rear, she isn't even home to be there for them. Her and her fake hair, manicured nails....ughh excuse me while i go puke!!!"
5,Saints Flag,The product was great!! It is heavy duty and you can read it from both sides unlike many of the lighter weight flags. We flew it high and proud in time for the Super Bowl!!! Geaux Saints!!!!
3,Dominic O'Brien's Memory Kit,"After reading the book and using one of O'Brien's maps, I was able to memorize 25 objects from 25 cards in less than 3 minutes. I then constructed my own memory map and repeated using a different 25 objects/cards again in less than 3 minutes. While using O'Brien's map works, you have to memorize the map first. This can take a while. Making up your own map does not take long and is much easier to visualize and use.I find this information valuable for study and memorization of information I need for my work. This kit is a good place to begin memory management."
5,Actually Makes a Difference!!!,"I was hopeless and willing to try anything after suffering from daily headaches and being diagnosed with chronic migraines. I chose not to go on the prescription medication due to side effects so I was basically just suffering through. I found this product online on a headache blog and decided to give it a try. It does burn for a few seconds (after all, you're spraying hot peppers up your nose) but once that fades - and it quickly does- you start feeling some relief immediately. I use it several times a day and for the first time in months I can get through my day without being completely miserable. I would ABSOLUTELY give this a try if you suffer from headaches."
2,try sinusbuster,I tried this after trying sinusbuster and I was disappointed. It does give less of a burn than sinusbuster but it doesn't completely get rid of the headache. If you've never tried sinusbuster (another capsacin nasal spray) or if sinusbuster was too strong for you it might be ok but I was disappointed.
1,Waste of money & hope,"I am 35 years old & have suffered from chronic migraine headaches for over 20 years. I have seen specialists, done more testing than I can remember & have tried every medication on the market. When I saw this product & read the reviews I thought maybe this could help...maybe this would work. I was wrong. I have used the product several times on various pain levels of headache & it has never helped, not even a little. It might work better for those who are fortunate enough (and I use that term loosely) to have occasional migraines, but with my chronic migraines I wasn't impressed."
2,No headache relief,"No doubt different things work for different people, but my husband and I both have tried this product when we had a headache and neither of us experienced any relief. I had high hopes for this since I have had a lot of success with other homeopathic remedies in the past, but this one doesn't seem to address headache pain for me."
2,Third party review - not so hot,"We purchased this for family. They report it didn't help them, but they have a lot of teeth issues also, so not sure if their pain is from sinus or gum/jaw."
1,No help.,"Again, same as with the Inold Sinus Spray with Capsacin, it didn't do anything but burn and make my eyes water like crazy. This is kind of one of those things where you take one pain to get you to forget about the other, but it is only momentarily."
4,Good Product,"I wouldn't say it ""cures"" the headache but makes it less painful... depends on the type of headache I guess."
1,Not strong enough for my head pain,"I tried Sinol with poor results. Actually, almost no relief at all from my serious headaches. Then I tried Sinus Buster with Feverfew. SinusBuster, for me, REALLY works. If I catch the head pain early, a couple of snorts of Sinus Buster takes the pain away completely!"
2,"dissapointing picture quality, easy MCE 2005 installation","I was mightily dissapointed with the picture quality through the cable input. I am using a 24"" Dell flat screen monitor to view, and aside from the MPEG artifacts, the TV contrast and color is horrible. Whites are severely blasted out, there is no true black, and color saturation is minimal. The signal strength of my cable may be an issue and I understand that TVs and computer monitors operate in different color spaces. But the drivers offer no way of tweaking the overlay signal to compensate! I can adjust the entire monitor to a level where it is slightly more acceptable to watch TV, but unacceptable for computer work - and vice versa. It is definitely NOT the monitor, as DVDs look great.On a positive note, installation was a snap and it was easily integrated into Media Center Edition 2005 without a hitch."
5,Brenda,"This is a wonderful product! We have an 8 year old shepherd/collie mix which we adopted from the local shelter. Unfortunately, he sheds tremendously and has a sensitive stomach. Even the groomer said she had never seen a dog that shed so much. This product works wonderfully. The best part is that our dog loves the taste and it does not cause stomach problems for him. We love it!"
3,Whitesnake's guitarplayers roots,"Adrian Vandenberg is WHITESNAKES (David Coverdale!) current guitarplayer on the ""Restless Heart"" CD. Most people know that he led his own Dutch outfit in the early eighties: VANDENBERG, who made 3 albums (smash hit: Burning Heart). However, only a few people know that in the late seventies he recorded an album of originals with his first band: TEASER. This album is now available on CD. The songs on the album are heavily influenced by FREE and BAD COMPANY. Not in the least because of singer extraordinaire Jos Veldhuyzen's bluesy and soulful contributions. Outstanding tracks are: What you need is love, Do it to me, Ride on train, I sold my soul to the rock and roll. TEASER only made one album before the band split. If you like the vocals than look for album's by Dutch Blues outfit FLAVIUM, where Jos Veldhuyzen has been singing for the last years. Teaser: Classic Dutch Seventies Rock!"
3,An enthusiastic bio,"Much has been written about Che, and rightfully so. He was a major figure of his time and his impact is still felt today. This is an updated bio of this controversial figure and the author tries to steer a balanced course. In the main it holds up well, but the author's unabashed admiration bleeds through the text enough for many to be able to dismiss it as just another propaganda piece. More's the pity. Still, if you're an ardent admirer who hasn't gotten around to reading this one, you'll find little to object to. If you consider the man just a vile terrorist, I guarantee you won't approve of the author's work, but you might try reading it anyhow with as open a mind as you can manage. Human beings who live their convictions to the fullest, no matter what we may think of them, should be of interest if for no other reason than for their rarity."
4,che lives,A pretty good book on Che for people who are studing him. May be alittle complex for beginners but all in all a great book on the legend!
4,fabulous,"""A Real Goodun"" really moves and has that raunchy, guttsy & bluesy Hammond B-3 organ sound! Other tracks have that nice drivin' swing beat from the era when jazz organ first become popular."
3,I CARE!!!,I really enjoyed this movie from Perry Como's 'Christmas Dream' at the beginning to the end. The only problem I had with it was the implausible part where Jon Voight gets a grey wig and moustache and is suppose to be much older and infiltrating The Odessa. But if you suspend disbelief during this part I think you will like the movie. Very intriguing.
3,the odessa file,"sadly we are unable to play the dvd's recd as they are for a differnet region than our dvd player, so basically a complete waste of money"
3,A Satisfactory Thriller,"An enjoyable film. It follows the book pretty closely and has loads of european atmoshphere - you can almost feel the cold. Jon Voight makes an excellent hero as he follows the clues that appear. The surprise at the end is typical of Frederick Forsyth`s novels. Quite unexpected and all the more successful because of that. The music adds to the Christmassy feel as the film begins. Perry Como is the singer. Sit back, relax and enjoy."
2,for rent only,"A weak action spying movie from the 70's. Good to rent only, for the days when you REALLY have nothing elso to do. Quality of the picture and sound of the DVD is just basic. Don't waste any money buying this DVD."
2,"Great movie, poor acting","I heard a lot of god things about the movie and recently bought it on Amazon.com. I am big fan of the world war II movies and this seems to be one for my collection. While this movie is a thrilling espionage classic, I havent seen worse acting in any other movie. I never was impressed by Jon Voight and this movie only reinforced my feelings. If you intend to buy this movie, I would recommend renting it first and then decide."
1,Thoroughly silly film,"The dumbed-down storyline of this film is typical of Hollywood failures of the 1970s. It presents the idiotic idea that a young journalist, who has already been identified and targeted by the villains would be used by the Mossad as an infiltrator into the very organization which is aware of the young ninny and his dimwitted attempt to uncover them.There are no convincing characters in the film, except for the one character who is playing himself, Simon Weisenthal. Voight delivers his usual lame performance as a mildly retarded person who, improbably, manages to overcome his opponents simply because they are even dumber than he is.This film is about as convincing as the TV serials inflicted upon us during the same time period in which ""The Odessa File"" was made."
4,"Taut, Compelling Suspense Thriller Filmed In West Germany","This film has much to commend it. Not only is the script fairly tight and compelling, it boasts strong performances by Jon Voight and the great Maximilian Schell as a perfectly delicious baddie. There are a few twists, and the supporting performances are solid as well. The scenes of the streets of Hamburg and other locations in then-West Germany add atmospheric realism to the unfolding conspiracy that Voight slowly discovers.I did want to comment on the excellent score by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber. I particularly love the way Perry Como's holiday song, Christmas Dream, is weaved into the plot and, depending on the circumstance, is either whimsical or menacing.Well done."
4,Great Post-WWII thriller story,Voight isn't my favorite actor in the world but I did love him in this and an older Maximilian Schell--neat :).I hate people who give away the movie so I won't say anything but I will say this: I wasn't expecting the ending.Worth the watch especially if you like WWII/post-war thrillers.
4,Post-War Nazi Espionage Thriller.,"Viewed: 12/12Rate: 712/12: The Odessa File is a thrilling but weak post-war Nazi espionage thriller. I just have a hard time believing that a news reporter can defeat a trained soldier like how Peter Miller was able to in the printing press building. And then, why would the mother would so easily spill the secrets like that to some stranger she hardly knows? It makes a logical sense for the ODESSA group to have Peter Miller killed very early in the film. However, it is a well-directed picture with Ronald Neame carefully orchestrating the moments of terror in the right places. Jon Voight is excellent as usual and is the biggest reason why I went for the film. Of course, the twist in the end is surprising and clearly explains the motives. All in all, The Odessa File is worth watching no matter what."
5,A Classic Thriller,"I first saw ""The Odessa File"" in the late seventies and I recall being very impressed at the time. So when I came across the DVD version at Mediaplay, I couldn't resist getting it to see if it would stand the test of time . I am glad I did because Ronald Naeme's film is as compelling and entertaining now as when I first saw it.Jon Voight stars as journalist Peter Miller who learns that an infamous Nazi may still be alive. Miller decides to try and track down the war criminal (played by Maximillian Schell) and bring him to justice. The film is helped by solid acting throughout, outstanding cinematography, and an effective score by Andrew Lloyd Webber. The climactic scene between Voight and Schell is absolutely brilliant. The DVD transfer is excellent and of a quality not usually seen in a seventies film with both widescreen and fullscreen versions included. Do yourself a favor and rediscover this classic and underrated gem!"
2,Why not widescreen?,"What dvd was William T. Parnell watching when he wrote his review? I bought the dvd of ""The Odessa File"" based on his review that it has both widescreen and fullframe versions on it. WRONG. I was very disappointed to find that I should have saved my money and stuck with my VHS tape. I love this movie but I try to make it a practice not to buy the DVD unless it comes in a widescreen version (unless, of course, the movie is so old that it wasn't made that way to begin with). Now I have wasted precious dollars that could have been used for something else (like gas money) all because of misinformation. Please, people, if you are going to write a review, get your facts straight first!!!!!"
4,Almost Great,"Everyone always says the book was better. In this case, I'd say that it's true in a relative sense as well. It's a good movie based on a great book. I was disappointed the first time I saw the movie. I like John Voight...and the basic story is true to the book, but it's just not as tense. The book sells the plot twists much better than the movie. You really get hit with a canoe paddle reading the book...with the movie it's just too linear. A factor of time constraints I guess...maybe it would have been a great 150 minute movie."
1,"Deceiving edition, hard to read, poor typography.","(This review is of course not on the plays and works themselves which are beyond praise, but on this particular edition).All pieces are packed in two columns, without separating pages, a few ugly frontispices, no table of content. Typography is old, greasy. Looks like the fac-simile of a cheap 19th century edition. No notes, no variants, no references, unpractical to read or to use in study, no added value. I do not recommend this at all for any purpose."
2,"Yeah, yeah, yeah","What they don't tell you is, this is LITERALLY a pocket edition. It is 0.75 inches by 0.3 inches, and the pages are so small and thin you need special equipment to read them. The book fits neatly in the pocket of my pants or my shirt. It even fits in my shoe.By the way, my shoe also fits in my shirt pocket."
4,Not bad,"Well, it's not the best and definitely not the worst, but what you buy is what you get. This book of course comes in the play version form, you know, with the Act I, Scene II kind of thing. And I know it's not in story book form but what'd you expect? It's the complete works and probably how he wrote it in the first place. It has all the plays(by SHAKESPEARE) that you could ask for, including poetry and sonnets. I think that so far it has been a thrill and an interesting read."
5,Can't use Illustrator without it!,This is the ultimate reference to Illustrator. More comprehensive and informative than anything else out there. It is written in easy to understand terminology and has excellent examples.
5,Another good Bible book,"I've been a fan of the Bible books for a long time, and this book epitomizes why I like them so much. It covers everything about the product in depth, and has many examples and walk through samples to help you learn some of the more difficult areas."
2,NOT for the beginner,"I am about half way into this book and it's driving my crazy. Thank god that I already know Photoshop 'cause otherwise I'd be lost. The book is badly organized, making references to tools that aren't introduced until 200 pages later, it lacks illustrations and clear examples and I've found several errors so far. It is repetitive in some ways which makes it boring to read. There has to be a better book out there."
2,"Buy this book, buy disappointment.","After all the other great reviews I was expecting something really good but its not.Its a tired rehash of previous versions of the same book for previous versions of Illustrator.The new stuff is stuffed in and the old stuff has been hastily altered because the publisher pulled the CD with the examples on.The whole thing doesn't work, there are better books out there.MJ"
5,Excellent! I love this book!,"This book has easily the best coverage of Illustrator 9 that I have found anywhere. I also picked up the Illustrator wow book, and was sorely disappointed in that (although it has very nice pictures). This book provides the in-depth information that I need. Great coverage of the new features like transparency and live effects, too."
3,Steep learning curve: Be prepared for confusion.... at first,"While I find this book to be one of the most informative books around on AI9 it has a few shortfalls. For one, it shouldn't use a word to describe itself!! This is one of my biggest peeves with this book in the earlier chapters. AI9 tools should be described in plain english. If your learning this for the first time be prepared to be a bit confused for a while. Second, many of the examples in the book are NOT clearly illustrated (how ironic) and last but certainly not least, some of the ""step by step"" examples should be made much easier to follow in the beginning of the book. For those that have some knowledge of AI9 or plan on doing this professionally, this is a must own!! Hopefully they will bring back the ""disk included"" for the next version. It is much easier to learn WITH the disk!! P.S. How about some more color for an illustration book."
5,Very nice flavored pop.,"I probably won't be ordering this from the internet very often because it's cheaper just to buy it at a store. It was nice to be stocked up on it though for a bit. I drink this particular pop all the time and wanted something that didn't have sugar in it because I'm trying to cut down. This is great for that. Plus, it has no calories, caffeine, and sodium. It also has a very clean crisp taste to it. They aren't too sweet and don't leave a nasty after taste. This particular flavor is really tasty, and one of my favorites. I'm always talking to my brother who's on diet that he should try them. They come in 4 different flavors that I know of...there might be more though... not sure. I simply just love these, enough said."
4,"OK, this was a textbook I needed for a class!","So let's be honest, I wasn't as excited about reading this book because I didn't have a choice in the matter. And it is not a book that I would have just picked up for my own personal reading.But it did the job I needed it to do and I'm passing the class."
4,This English Book was a real help in class,My teacher says that we can keep this book for a reading reference even after the class. Because it includes teachings on basic English Grammar rules that can be used through out college and into writing afterwards. I wore my out. When I purchased the book it was used and in very good shape. The teacher decided not to teach out of this book for the reason that there were some areas where he did not agree on about the way of the teaching on a specific item.
4,Teacher edition,This book was in great condition. The only problem I had was it was the teacher edition so all of the worksheets in the book were already filled out.
3,Same replacement,I ordered this to replace one I thought had worn out. It works the same way as the original so it did not solve the problem. Water doesn't drain through easily when the baffle is set in the inner ring. I either have to take it out or have it partially out. It does make the grinding noise almost unnoticeable though.
4,Does the job,It would gotten five stars if it didn't block up so easily. I guess that's a side-effect of the anti-noise feature.
2,Does not fit GE Disposals,"I was excited about the sound baffle and the other reviews and although I knew I was taking a risk, I didn't think garbage disposals were so different. I mean, how they heck to the fit in the sink if they come in different sizes? Well I don't know, but this super baffle thingy didn't fit in mine and GE doesn't have something similar. Bummer."
3,Great quality - doesn't work,"After diligently researching for a replacement baffle for my ISE disposer, I thought that I had found the answer in the ISE ""QCB-AM Anti-Microbial Quiet Collar Sink Baffle, Black"" as described on the amazon.com site.Unfortunately, neither the description nor the reviews mention that this will not work with a ""batch-feed"" disposer. That is, one that requires you to use the stopper to activate the unit, rather than use a wall switch. I didn't research diligently enough!The part fit great and looks that it is very well made so I hope that ISE makes a replacement baffle similar to this one that I can purchase."
1,unnecessary item if you buy a new insinkerator,"I bought a new insinkerator, but the contents weren't listed. I followed the ""customers also buy"" and bought this and the flange- they're both included in a new insinkerator so I needed to pay to return them."
3,Splash guard,Fits the drain fine. The new design of splash guards narrows the throat of the sink drain. Food waste doesn't fall through the splash guard and down the drain as easily as it used too. It's a little annoying but manageable.
1,Sooo Depressing,"This was the most depressing book I ever read. I kept waiting for something good to happen, just one small thing that shows that there was some joy in the characters life.I was so frustrated and disappointed at the end of the book, I vowed not to read another book from Oprah's book list."
2,"great in theory, but...","I have this phone, in fact, I liked the idea and look of it so much, I hoped the problems I was having were just specific to the phone I bought - meaning hopefully it was a lemon.Unfortunately, I bought another one and replaced it and still have a problem with it. Periodically the phone cuts in and out so it sounds like you are on a cell and going through a bad cell site...This is on the corded phone, not the extension.Everything else with the phone is fine, you have all the features you could want, but this little problem is enough of a nuisance to really bring down the rating.If you buy it, I hope you don't have the same problem. For me, I lived with it for about a month, then it started getting worse. That's when I returned the first phone and got the replacement...it's started with this one, but I can't find a corded phone w/an extension for anywhere near the same price, and the only other one I've found is another AT&T.Hope this is helpful."
1,Product Stinks,Well I read the reviews & most seemed good but I ordered this phone from Amazon for my mom for Christmas & it came all boxed up but when she set it all up it doesn't work. The answering machine does not accept incoming messages. We tried everything to reset it & get it working. No such luck. She spent an hour on the phone w/AT & T trying to get it to work then they said its broke (hmmmm no kidding) and to send it back to them. Disappointed in amazon as well cuz now we have to pay shipping to send to AT & T???? And its gonna take another 3 weeks to get it back. Doesn't seem right for a product you pay for - we got ripped off.
4,Dependable and cheap,"This is a great product, with all features a home phone user wishes. The price could not be matched even by Amazon, a must have corded phone, by the way, its the best corded phone i ve seen recently, the cordless handset is average voice quality but worth its price two times"
3,Generally pleased with this phone,"This phone had the features I wanted: caller ID, answering system with multiple mailboxes, speakerphone and the combination base/corded phone. I am mostly satisfied, but I think there is some room for improvement: The cordless handset is significantly smaller than the one I had previously. Another annoyance is that the buttons on both phones are rather small. Also, the CIDs are not as vibrant and easy to read as they appear in the pictures. The sound quality is adequate."
2,Cordless Phone Fails the Test,"The idea of matching corded and cordless phones was appealing. The corded phone was excellant. The cordless phone was worthless. The cordless phone had constant static. After following the trouble shooting instructions, visiting the AT&T website and calling customer service I decided to return the phone based on AT&T's recommendation. AT&T's customer service person was hard to get to via the voice mail web. Once in contact with the service employee things went quickly. Amazon's return procedure was painless and prompt."
4,original Axis power supply with international plugs,"The order fulfilled by Amazon came with original Axis power supply, including international power adapter plugs to cover just about all plug type of the world. You could probably find a similar power supply at a Radio Shack or eBay, but this is the one to get if you're looking for a original Axis power adapter replacement.Strongly Recommended."
1,No legal overview or summary - Just cases,"My professor was great, but I'm disappointed in his choice of text. This author seemingly downloaded some popular property cases, threw them in a book, added a couple of cartoons, and then sold it as original authorship. The price tag of $100+ was a nice touch for something that probably took a couple of office clerks 2-3 weeks to hammer out.I'm sincerely confused why this book is even contributed to an ""author."" What I ask, did this person write? Ugh."
2,I agree.,"I agree with the reviewer below (or is it above?). I'm almost done with this semester and this has been and will be my toughest course, not because of the material, but because of the way the material is delivered in the casebook. I started with the 1999 edition and was shocked to find that it didnt include a table of cases. A casebook w/o table of cases??? come on! The 2005 edition fixed this problem, but many remain. The problems were clearly listed in the other review, and I concur."
1,Bottom of the casebook barrel,"At the beginning of this, my first year of law school, I didn't think too much about my actual casebooks. After a couple months, I began to think more about their layout, the organization, case notes, questions, indexes, etc. I began to have favorites, and some that I was less fond of. But until I saw this casebook, I didn't realize casebooks could be so awful. This casebook is badly in need or further organization, better headings, a better table of contents, better editing - in short, all of the details that make or break a casebook.Just to be clear, I am reviewing the second edition, published in 2009. I have also seen the first edition, and the best I can say is that this is, in fact, a significant improvement over the first attempt. But it has a long way to go before any 1L is going to be happy with it."

2,Pale Island in the Sun,"I found it very disappointing. I have known these songs (Island in the Sun, Yellow Bird, Maryann) since childhood and was really looking forward to listening to this CD. They sounded like they recorded it in a tin shed, the vocals were wimpy and the whole effect was not the joyous sound of the islands. I will keep on looking for a good collection of these songs!"
1,A load of garbage from a self-aggrandizing blow-hard.,"If there is a passage that defines this book, it's the one on page 74, where he uses his superior intellect and social conservatism to declare that ""...[the human assembler of pre-manufactured parts] is not necessarily a bad man. It merely means that his education in his trade has been bad.""What an amazing nugget of wisdom from a man who browbeats the greater population for our consumption of mass-manufactured objects. No, David, assemblers who aren't emotionally or pridefully connected to the object are just deficient people, worthy of the utmost contempt. Start up a death camp if they bother that bad, Nazi bastard. Labor thanks you for your morsels of understanding and forgiveness.Don't waste your money. Don't make ugly work."
1,A Promise Unkept,"This book starts out with a lot of promise. The story and characters, if properly developed could have been wonderful. Sadly the whole book falls flat. Their (the characters) and their interactions are lacking an element that is needed to be real. Domenica, the lady love, lacks spirit that would have made the story any good. Ms. Armstrong could have done much better."
4,Kicks major ass!,"This is a great action packed & fun film to watch, inspiring coming from indie filmmakers, I look fwd to more from these guys!"
4,Cute movie,"The most been said, so I only will add.If you like to spend 90minutes entertained and don't wanna think to much, than get this movie.It's really likeable and my friend & I had a good time watching this movie last night."
4,Romancing the Bride - Great Movie,I really think this is a chick flick but even my hubby found it entertaining. I'm glad I bought a DVD copy for my DVD/VHS library.
5,Romancing the Bride,"I love this movie, and I was so excited to see that it was available on DVD. So many movies that are on TV aren't."
4,Cute & corky,"A good choice for a romantic comedy. I seen this movie on lifetime once & bought it that night. It is corky ... but come it, it's a MOVIE (it's not supposed to be like real life)! I love the cast, it was great to see Carrie Fisher (she is too funny) & everyone really blended well together on screen. Over all, I really do like it & the funny slapstick's that are packed into it."
3,Good set. 2012 budget box issued for about $40,"Good early digital recording and very good, but not always stellar, voices. Given the fast tempos, it is ridiculous that several acts were divided onto 2 CDs when they could have been fit onto 1. Walkure belongs on 3 CDs. That said, this is very enjoyable in a lighter-than-Solti-or-Karajan-or-Krauss way. Just don't buy this older edition selling for outrageous prices when a newer box is around for relative pennies."
1,The Book of U. S. Postal Exams,"This is a great book if you are trying to get your foot in the door. However, I am currently a Postal employee and bought the book because the title claims to show you how to score 90-100% on postal exams. Wrong! It willl give you sample questions from most of the tests, but, any technical skills that you will need for higher paying skilled jobs will be up to you to teach yourself."
5,Share this book!!!,"This is a marvelous book to read and to give as a gift to women of all ages. It is a small treasure that addresses everyday issues illustrated in story form. There are many books written about womens' issues, but this book, though small, has so much that one can relate to .. the chapter about Aunt Dora inspired a wonderful trip, the chapter ""Calling all Grandmas"" was so relevant and ""Throwaway Lines"" is a chapter that we could all use when facing the garage and ""life"" culling.I find it marvelous and cannot recommend it more highly.MOTHER'S DAY PRESENT!!!! well any time of year and great gift to yourself or someone you know!"
5,This book changed my life,"Look For the Moon in the Morning is a selection of smart, well-written essays that simply cannot be put down. A page-turner, this book made me laugh, cry, nod with recognition and helped me understand things in my life that were going on and had gone on with a sense of relief. Leda Sanford's candor and self-knowledge helped me relate to my own issues and helped me feel a sense of will to go on and tackle many of life's challenges with a sense of renewal. I enthusiastically recommend this book for people of all ages."
4,Only book of its kind,"I read this book while researching a film about mummies. It is, to my knowledge, the only book of its kind. Most think of mummies as belonging exclusively to the ancients--Egyptian, Peruvian, and otherwise--but this book illuminates a continuing need to deny the reality of ""dust to dust"" in our modern age. Passages on the secular communist icons that have undergone permanent emblaming (Mao, Lenin) and on Summum Corp., a contemporary mummification facility, are very interesting. Highly recommended."
1,"Ugh, don't waste your time.","I buy A LOT of Permuted Press books, and I have to say that this little guy was the worst. Reminded me of a short story a high school kid would come up with. Very disappointed, as reviews were pretty good on it. If you're an adult, don't be fooled by the good reviews this thing got. It's clearly been reviewed by 12 year-olds."
1,thank god reading this was only temporary as well,"This book was really god awful, i normally don't rate a book this low unless it is totally devoid of any value. This book jumps all over the place without a coherant thought or premise. The only thing we as readers know for sure is the world is going to be smashed by a comet, thats all. This guy runs around half in fantasy and half in reality and the author just bounces the reader off so many walls you really can't get a take on things. If the book was 1,000 pages then the author might have the room for this kind of character development, but in a novella or a short book there's no time. I read this disaster with anticipation that it was going to get really good on the next page, well i ran out of pages and this book should never have been printed. I think that with some more work this story could be fleshed out and made more coherant but right now don't waste your time or money."
5,The haunting juxtaposition of the simple and the absurd,"Joel Brouwer writes with an Xact-o knife, not a pen, and slices to the bone of every subject he tackles. This second (prose) poetry collection exposes the elegance of war, love, childhood, death, sex and art. Brouwer is as adroit dealing with the violence of injustice and he is dealing with the thrum of nostalgia. Brouwer's language is subversive, tangy, witty, clever, and hip. Consider, in ""Father"": ""Night fell like a wheelchair dropped from a roof"" or the Dobyns-ish ""Ideas"" which begins, ""Arrive unannounced, radiator fuming, honk shave-and-a-haircut in the driveway"".What are you waiting for?? Go get this collection!"
4,Fragile: Read with care,"Take this collection slowly. The vivid, surreal images imprint themselves on the unwary mind. Powerful and disturbing, these poems force the reader into an alternate perspective, an alternate state of mind. I left this collection changed."
3,Slow process time... use a wire.,"My general rule of thumb is dont buy anything wireless, since it invariably sucks. I don't know why i thought this would be any different, i suppose i figured the developers would have forseen such an obvious problem pertaining to dancing games and made sure transmit time was at a minimum. Yet even for a medium-level DDR player such as myself there is quite noticable latiency time for the IR data to transmit and process, meaning one must step slightly before the beat in order to score a ""perfect"" for that step. Easy enough to get used to on slower songs, but anything faster than around 160 bpm and your screwed."
1,Terrible Mat,This mat is absolutely terrible. The wireless makes a delay so whenever you try and hit an arrow it NEVER GETS PERFECT! I'm using this with a Dual Box Ps2 > USB converter and Stepmania. I compared it to my Intec wired pad and it was incredible how much easier the wired pad was. I am going to buy another pad and sell this one somehow. My advice is to not buy this product.
5,It's an exciting book to do with friendship and skating.,I enjoyed this because I had had times like that even though in the skating club that I skate in you don't have to try out. The book is excellant each character repersents itself well. No one would want to miss it
4,Just a Lot of Fun,I found this game easy to use and very challenging. Kept my interest for quite a while. I found the characters to be very interesting and fun. I just didn't want to put it down.
2,"Do yourself a favour, just play Punch-Out instead","Most definitely NOT in the same league as Punch-Out. It's pretty, granted, but the bland, unnecessarily slow-paced gameplay, which relies less on actual strategy and more on ridiculous amounts of endurance, more than counteracts any good the graphics might have done.Also, ""dumb hick"" humour has been done to death. This game isn't nearly as funny as it thinks it is. A few of the characters have admittedly amusing designs, but without clever writing to back it up, they fail to make any sort of real impact.Clearly, this game is made by people who liked Punch-Out, yet somehow they've missed out on the elements that actually made that game, y'know, fun. This wouldn't be horrible as a free fan Flash game. As something you're actually expected to pay money for, though....no thanks."
3,Game is too hard. VERY HARD !,"There's no easy level. I couldn't beat the first enemy. Everytime i try to pucnh, the enemy will ALWAYS block my punch. There is NO WAY to punch the enemy. Its supposed to be a boxing game, not a ""hey beat me"" kind of game. This game sucks because i couldnt play it. If i couldnt play it, 99% of gamers out there wouldnt be able to play too."
3,Disappointing,"Don't waste your time or money on this book, there are much better books out there. I actually did purchase this book before going snorkelling or diving in Hawai'i and found that not nearly all the fish I saw were in here. If you want something that covers all Hawaiian fish pick up: Hawaii's Fishes : A Guide for Snorkelers, Divers, and Aquarists (Hoover). This book, Hawaiian Reef Fish: The Identification Book, often lacked species and had many fish incorrectly named. The pictures and ease of use are the best aspects of this book, but they don't make it worth it."
5,The EASY WAY OF SELLING,"THIS BOOK IS FULL OF SOMETHING YOU HAVE TO KNOW IF YOU ARE NOT A SALESMAN. IT IS VERY GOOD FOR BEGINER, AND PROFFESSIONAL TO REFRISH THEIR RULES. THE BOOK IS VERY CLEAR AND VERY SHOT, YOU CAN READ IT IN TWO HRS, BUT YOU WILL GOT ALOT OF THINGS. I HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THIS BOOK TO ANY NEW SALESMAN LOOKING FOR A BOOK TO START. SAYED OMAR- EGYPT- AUC"
2,"Eeeeeeeeeeehhhh, not so great","Don't waste your money on this book. You're better off reading the advisory committee notes in the FRE rulebook than this thing. It's cursory and the illustrations are ridiculous. Stick to the Finals books; they're more helpful for Evidence, I think."
4,"What is does, it does well","There is not much to this book, which is probably caused by the fact that there is not much to an intro evidence course. If you are taking an Evidence course based on the Federal Rules, I am not sure that this book is a whole better than getting the Federal Rules and reading its comments. Then why I am rating this book at 4 stars, rather than lower? Because what this E&E book does, it does well."
1,Junk,"I regret buying this keyboard. I have had trouble getting it to work. The website--Omiz--appears to be a global website for a Chinese electronics manufacturer, and offers very little help. I received no instructions on how to program ""hot keys""---e.g. to start my e-mail program, etc. It is over priced, and very difficult to use. There must be something better out there. Also, watch out, it is not sold by Amazon, but by some other vendor."
2,No instructions or product manual,Came shipped without instructions or product manual. Not sure exactly where 2 mystery pin pieces go... no up-close photos of the assembled product available at Amazon or on company web-site.
1,"Wonderful, but copy protected","I've heard this before (via Internet Radio), and loved it, which is why I bought it. Well... this is one of those infernal copy protected CDs that won't play in a PC or Mac. I'm now rather peeved that I can't play this at work (where I use a computer to play music). This is a serious infringement of my fair use rights, and I therefore recommend that you give this one a miss until the recording companies come to their senses."
5,My first TTF CD,"This is my first CD of the long series, and I do seriously love it. I bought it ""Specs"" music, and, by the salesmen recommendations. He told me that it was very hard, very fast, very moving, and...he was absolutely correct. This is not really the ""chilling"" type of trance that Tiesto has, or Oakenfold. This is definitely strong, fast, and moving trance. Very good, very melodic, very catchy.One thing I hate about it, it's that won't play in my computer, and it takes a little long to start playing in my Sony CD player...I'm guessing because of the copy-right thing. I don't like that, but well, nothing's perfect.I highly recommend it if you're looking for hard, fast, moving trance. If you're trying to chill, look elsewhere, example at ""Summerbreeze"" by DJ Tiesto."
2,Silly copy protection on this CD,"Keeps me from ripping track 17 of CD1. All other tracks were ok in audiocatalyst 2.1 on win2k in aspi mode with aspi_me.exe installed. The Music is ok, not as good as 19 or 22."
5,Very Good Book to Study Adaptive Control,"I found this book explains the field of adaptive control very well. It covers its basic theory, its proof, and also its application. It is very good book for anybody who has interest in adaptive contro, and for anybody who will just begin to study about adaptive control."
3,What about Bacon Fat?,"For excellent early Rod Piazza harp blues music , see the Blue Horizon album titled ""Grease One for Me"". It looks like the music on that album is now on an import titled ""The Complete Blue Horizon Sessions"" along with George Smith. Search ""Bacon Fat"" and you will find an album that has what you are looking for. Boom Boom out go the lights!"
2,"Saves on papaer waste, but coffee is weak","I have thought about one of the permanent filters for a while, and this one fits the Mr. Coffee just fine, but the coffee is considerable weaker flavor than with a paper filter. I compared how fast water from a faucet runs through it versus a paper filter, and it ran through the basket 3 or 4 times faster. I assume the having less time to steep is why the coffee is weaker."
2,"yes, weak coffee","I agree with previous reviewers, this filter creates weak coffee. Get the Mr. Coffee version of the same."
1,Why is it suggested together with Hamilton Beach 48274 Brew Station 6-Cup???,"I followed the suggestion as a complementary purchase for the Hamilton Beach 48274 Brew Station 6-Cup Coffeemaker... yes,6-cup, not 4! And no, it does not work anyway... Well, I guess it is my fault!"
2,weak coffee,"Should've heeded previous review about coffee being weak. Same amount of coffee that tastes fine with paperfilter comes out way too weak with this filter. Not worth it to, as he mentioned, use more coffee as recommended by manufacturer. Back to paper filters."
3,"A good filter, but...","...some of the finest grounds go thru the holes & end up in my coffee. I'm considering buying paper filters to place _around_ this filter. I might be able to use 1 paper filter per week, since the permanent filter would contain 99% of the grounds. We'll see...This filter is well-made and should last a long time; it's easy to handle and empty."
4,Solid Machine,"Solid machine, well built, I like the settings for strong to weak coffee brewing, but the strong setting takes a little long. What I don't like is being billed for PRIME membership before the 30 day trial period had been completed. Please cancel and reimburse the $79 or I'll never buy a single thing through Amazon."
1,permanent coffee filter,"Although well made, the permanent basket coffee filter was essentially useless; it let so many fine grounds through that I had to use a paper filter along with it and finally stopped using the permanent filter altogether. An ineffective product that did not do the job I expected of it."
4,check size on filter,"Received the Medelco coffee filter quickly. However, it was not a 4-cup but an 8-cup. Contacted seller and was immediately refunded. This is a quality permanent filter and, other than the size, was just what I was looking for."
3,Saves a little money,"I like it because I don't have to worry about running out of filters. Little more trouble, because you clean it rather thanthrow it away."
3,Just barely!,"The measurements for the filter were not given and it just barely will work in my pot. If the measurements had been given, I would not have ordered it. It is smaller that the previous 4 cup filters I have had and, in my opinion, not a standard size (I base that on 2 4-cup coffee pots I have). But - I must admit - it's better than fooling with the paper filters."
4,Makes a good cup of coffee,"I got this so I could be more earth friendly, and it seems to do its job just fine. My coffee has come out good everytime so far. It is also easy to clean."
4,Filter works well,"This product is well made and works as advertised. Very convenient compared to paper filters and seems sturdy enough to last for years. Once broken in with a few weeks use, the coffee flavor is quite good."
5,Excellent Cup of Coffee,"I have just made my first pot of coffee with this inexpensive filter, and it tastes great! I would definitely recommend it. No problems whatever to report, either with the function or the results."
4,"Works fine, handle falls off",Filter basket works fine and fits well in my 5 cup Black & Decker coffee maker. Handle (which I don't need) falls off everytime I wash the basket.
1,BLECHHH!!!,"Thanks to the good folks at Medelco, I now have a new standard by which to judge a terrible cup of coffee."
1,Rip off pricing and shipping,"This filter has been for sale for 8.99 recently, but now other sites all lead only to here where it is suddenly selling for $16.99 (""down from $23.99"" is BS), at twice the price. The larger 10 cup model only costs 9.99, is available everywhere.Then, insultingly, shipping weight is listed as a whopping lying 4 pounds. This item weighs 3 ounces (company website is honest at least).Isn't that illegal, to charge shipping costs based on fake weights? I know handling costs something, but that is in a different tax category - shipping ""reimbursement"" goes right into the seller's pocket as hidden profit. It probably costs 80 cents parcel post to send this item. They want to charge 10 times that amount when it is already marked up 175 percent!What gives? If sellers wanted to help the environment, they would make products such as this easily available, not take such gross advantage of people trying to change. This is called profiteering."
1,Coffee is very weak,I actually read reviews that said weak coffee and bought it in spite of what I read. Now I feel silly because they were right so I will stick with paper filters. Believe the reviews that say weak coffee as they are true.
5,Best cup of coffee in years,Excellant. Having the mesh on the bottom and the sides makes a world of difference. You get all the coffee flavor. Easy to clean and no grounds in the coffee!Best of all no more paper filters- good for the eco.
1,Medco 4-cup Permanent Coffee Filter,I prefer paper filters as this thing is a pain to clean...much easier to toss the paper ones. But this will be handy if I happen to run out!
1,Makes weak coffee,"As others have written, this is too porous, so that the water runs out of the basket before it can extract the coffee flavor from the grounds. I'm greatly disappointed (even though I paid only $4.99 at K-Mart.) A waste of money."
4,Quite a nice book.,"This book has a great many different short stories. They give the student a good feel for the perspectives and culture of their time. It is interesting to see how literature evolves over time as well. I do have to say though, that it does not really highlight the masterpieces of world literature. A teacher might be better off (especially for the money) buying individual copies of say, Shakespeare novels, some Charles Dickens, Dostoyevsky, or other paramount examples of world literature. Also, the reflection questions are not great."
3,Okay,The hard cover was different compare to the original picutre that posted on the profit.Inside of book was same however.
2,NOT AS BIG AS IT LOOKS!!!,"The mask claims to be adult size. However unless your a child, don't plan to have much us with it. It won't fit."
2,Way too small...,Quality was fine but the sizing was way off. This was more of a child's size mask than an adults.
5,I Am Batman,"The mask looks ALOT better than what is pictured in the photo. Might want to update that to make the purchase more enticing. As some others have said, the Batman symbol's yellow is a tad light, may require some touch up. Also you'll need a pretty small head and not alot of hair to fit into this mask. Head circumference shouldn't be larger than say 23"". Great product nonetheless."
4,Better than the horrible picture,"I don't know who is wearing this thing in the image but this is the first product I've gotten that is actually better than the picture.It actually does a really good job of looking like the 1992 batman.It had a warped area around the left eye and the ears are bent but I just stuffed the ears and they are fine. Also if there is something warped like my eye are was just use a blow dryer and you can heat it up, put it on, then mold it into place no problem. It had no creases.I did need to take some scissors to it and cut the eye area a bit. There are these inner folds that will poke your eye lid, but if you cut those out it looks exactly the same and is comfortable. I like it."
3,Large Heads Beware!,"While this mask is nice enough, it definately will not fit on an average sized man's head. It is maybe 17-18 inches or so, not the 20 inches a previous reviewer suggested. It is ""one size,"" but would probably be considered a size ""small"" if sizes were given."
4,a general review of African Art,"A view of African Art suitable for a student or any one who like a historical general review of the art and craft of this continent. There is no ""African Art"" because of the regional differences in this huge continent just as there is no review of ""american art"" but this volume is a good introduction and well illustrated."
5,Great find,Awesome for and service or residential electrician needing to find a breaker and or needing to hear the beap while standing at the panel.
4,Handy,"Very handy. The magnet must be a rare-earth varity because it is extremely strong. Their home page is www.pluggrip.com . The replacement battery for the SwitchGrip is Model No. 20323 volt, coin cell lithium. The Switchgrip I purchased at Home Depot came without a battery so I had to look it up."
3,Bee pendannt,"The pendant was darling, but the clasp on the chain was too small and I kept losing the chain.I had to purchase a new chain. Disappointing, and time consuming. But the bee is cute!"
3,"it conked out, got the runaround on exchanging it","My baby loved this mobile. BUT after a week it started squeaking loudly - she didn't mind, but I did - then after about 3 weeks, the music kept going but the mobile stopped rotating at all. I didn't have the gift receipt and had already thrown out the packaging (always hold on to all of this stuff if you can!) and was told by a babiesrus manager that it couldn't be exchanged. Luckily I called back to the registry desk (they can look up and see that this item was purchased for me off the registry)and they said it could be exchanged for a new one. Hurray for perseverance."
5,You MUST own this mobile!!,"When my son was about 6 weeks old we bought this for him. He loved looking at it and he would watch it with his little legs kicking away. This was such a help for me, it was the only way that I could do anything when he was born. I would place my son in his crib and play the mobile and voila I had a few minutes to do the dishes or pick up my home or wash up. I loved this mobile so much (as did my son) that I bought it for 3 friends that were having babies as well. Also the music was excellent and had a rich tone. There was also a high or low feature which helped control the volume a bit. I spent 40.00 for this and I would have spent 100 if I had to. We used this several times a day until he was 6 mos old."
2,Great Mobile But Doesn't Last Long,I bought this mobile when my 3 1/2-year-old was a baby. He absolutely loved it but it broke rather quickly. I bought another one right before my infant daughter was born. She also loved it but this one died rather quickly too. I have now purchased a different mobile b/c I didn't want to throw away more money on this product. It's too bad they didn't last long b/c my kids sure did love to watch it.
2,It broke after several weeks of using product,the product is great when it works. I was able to use it for about a month then all of a sudden it stopped rotating. I was never able to fix it and the instructions were in French so that did not help. I kept the music box part of the mobile and had to throw the rest of it away. Keep your receipt and box in case it breaks so you can return it. It is not a very durable mobile like the other winding types but it is better and your baby will really like it.
2,2 returned- broken motors,I love this mobile but gave up on it when I returned the second one because the motor broke again. It also takes a lot of batteries. If you live near a babies r us and keep the recept go ahead and buy it since its great when it works. But- it will break- even the girls at babies r us have said that they are having trouble with the company.
2,worked for 2 minutes,yes it looks great but after putting it together i couldn't get the rotation to stop at all - and then when i did it didn't rotate ever againvery dissappointing
2,Nice mobile but it stopped working,The motor on this mobile stopped working after only a few weeks of light use. Other reviewers have noted the same problem. I was very disappointed because our son was fascinated with it from the time he was born.
5,Mesmerizes babies and adults alike,"When my wife became mesmerized watching this mobile in action at her sister's, I knew we had to get it. It really is amazing how all the parts twist, twirl, and rotate. There are so many different motions going on, it's impossible to get bored watching it. The music is nice and soothing. The contrasting colors are great for getting your little one's attention and focus. We were confident that the time spent with this mobile was really developing her senses. A ""Must Get""."
3,Baby loves it; parents aren't so happy...,"This is by far the best looking mobile out there, and our 6-week old loves watching and listening during diaper changes. That said, we're really disappointed. After only two weeks, the mobile stopped turning almost every time we turned it on. Secondly, there are only two volumes to choose from for the music - I call them ""loud"" and ""louder."" The instructions say you have to take it down from the crib when your baby is five months old, b/c it is a choking hazard. Overall, for the money, it should be better."
2,same thing,"it worked great for the first week we've had it. now, however the motor broke. the music plays but the damn thing does not rotate. my seven week old baby is not happy!"
2,"Too Loud, Too Flimsy","It is a pretty mobile with lots of interesting things to look at for your baby, but after using it for last six months, I cannot recommend it.First, this mobile is LOUD. The motor is not too bad, but the turning mechanism is VERY loud with very annoying clicking sound. It also has small plastic parts that slide up and down as the mobile turns and it also makes a terrific racket. If you are looking for a mobile to entertain your baby, this is it. If you looking for this mobile to soothe your baby - you need to get something else.Second, it broke within 5 months. The arm part that connects the mobile to the base comes apart. Sometimes when you put it together, the connection does not get set and the mobile does not turn. We fudged with this thing for several months before it finally died on us - so no more turning. Very shoddy quality for something this expensive."
4,When you need 15 minutes of time...,"Our son is now 3 months old and loves this mobile. He typically views it once a day, and kicks his legs and swings his arm from excitement during the entire time. This mobile is twisting, colorful, and has uplifting music. The only draw back that I have found is that the batteries die quickly, so either purchase stock of a battery company, or use rechargeable batteries."
5,Wonderful gift !,"I gifted this to a couple who just had a baby...and they called me back to say what a wonderful gift it was. They said they had similar poroducts with them, but this one was the best& did the trick. The baby stares at it for more then 30 minutes quitely listening to it and admiring it..and this gave them time to do other chores in the house. And when she cries, all they have to do is switch on the mobile and lo & behold, she is quite. I am buying this again now for another friend of mine...truly a wonderful gift which the receipents would thank you forever for."
5,Can't live without it!!!!!,"I don't know how I would get throught the day without this mobile I have recommended to every pregnant mother that I meet.My daughter just loves her ""friends""."
3,Okay,"I really like it, my baby looks up at it when spinning, clear sound but batteries run out quick. I would suggest puirchasing rechargable batteries if your gonna purchase this item."
4,Could use something,I like this product very much except for one thing. You are unable to play music only or run the mobile only. It would be nice to not have to have both music and mobile going at once.
3,great mobile but not very durable,this is a great mobile to keep your child entertained but it is not very durable the plastic tabs broke on ours and it does not stay in place very long.
4,"Great product, but needs adjusting.","I received this product as a baby shower gift. As I was assembling it I had found a problem with how it is manufactured. When I placed the batteries in, and tightened the cover as indicated, this mobile stopped working when I placed it on its back. I had discovered that there was a problem. There is a space between the batteries and the top cover. Therefore when it is placed on its back, the batteries fall out of alignment and it ceases to work properly. I contacted the company and am waiting to hear their response to this issue. For now, I had placed a special sponge on the inside cover that is used by most toy battery covers and it works fine. However, I am not sure if this is up to code."
3,Too scary,"I don't know where the child care industry gets the idea that bright colors and geometric shapes are ""soothing."" I got this mobile as a gift but my 3-month-old daughter does NOT like it at all. She pulls up her arms and stares at it sideways, looking completely freaked out. I agree with a fellow reviewer; it is TOO much stimulation. My daughter's original mobile had pastel moons and stars and she would dance under it at coo at it. Too bad the motor on that one broke!The music on this mobile is very nice, however; not your typical tinny electronic beeps (what my mom calls ""tacky music""). It sounds like a real piano. I wish they would make more music boxes for children's toys like this!"
3,"Baby loves it, but where is the mute button?","Our baby just loves the mobile for all the reasons listed above: colors, music, movement. If she could laugh already she would, but for now she responds by smiling, cooing,, kicking her feet and watching the mobile go round and round.The biggest disappointement is on our part. Why don't the have a mute or volume off button? I realize the music is a big selling point, but in today's market almost every other toy with music gives you the option to turn the music off (not just high and low). Our little girl would still love the mobile, and her parents would get a break from the monotonous music. Come on Tiny Love, get with the times!"
3,satisfied but noisy,"I really liked the reviews of this mobile and registered for it even though it did not match the decor of the room. It's real cute and I like the classical music; But... Why is the speaker on the inside of the crib, behind the bumper? And, Why is the motor so noisy?I guess it depends on your motive, if you are trying to stimulate the baby, then the blocks clinking together and the noise from the motor (louder than the music, behind the bumper)are okay. And, let's face it, most infants would not notice. If you want the baby to calm down and go to sleep, then I recommend pulling out the moving parts to make it stop moving and letting the child enjoy the music.Over all, I would recommend it over a wind up pastel, any day."
1,poorly made,This was bought for my newborn grandaughter. It was sold as the Cadillac of mobiles. This is far from the truth. It is poorly made and is falling apart after only a few weeks of use.The falling rings make an annoying clacking noise and The mobile does not fit on all cribs. We had to replace this mobile with a different brand.
2,"Great at first, but both of mine broke","I bought both types of the Symphony in Motion mobiles -- one for my son's crib at home, and the other for his crib at daycare. He absolutely loved both of them and would get so excited when I turned them on. However, both of them broke after only a few months of use. The on/off button is not making the right connection with the inside parts to turn it on. When I push the button, nothing happens. When it happened on the first one, I thought maybe it was a fluke. But when I had the same problem with the other one, I realized it might not be well made. I am really upset, too, because my son really loved both of them. Now he gets aggravated when he looks up at the mobile and it doesn't move."
2,manufacture defect,"We have received this item, Symphony-in-motion mobile Geometric shapes from our friend before our baby was born. We loved it at first. Both classical music that plays for 15 minutes and those moving shapes with colors that would stimulate the vision and hearing of the babies. It worked for few times and it stopped moving. The music still plays with no problem, but the movement stopped. We first thought it was the battery problem, but it still didn't work after the new batteries had put in. I sent e-mail to the ""Tiny love"" to ask possible manufacture defect or any suggestion, but they never replied back to me. I was very excited about the product at first, but now, I am very dissapointed that it was broken too soon (only after third time). I want to tell people not to get this product because I don't want them to have the same problem."
1,Don't waste your money!!!!!,"My 5 week old son really enjoyed this mobile for the few hours he watched it, then it stopped working. As others had mentioned, the motor stopped working and the mobile no longer spins. The music works fine. I was skeptical of others reviews that said theirs broke, so I went ahead and got it. I could not believe it when mine stopped working TOO!!!! It's hard to believe that something that costs [$] only worked for about 3 total hours. Don't waste your money!!!!!...."
5,My Baby Loves It!,My daughter has loved this from day one. The music is pleasant and not too loud. Most importantly it holds her interest long enough for me to take a shower! This mobile is a godsend.
5,"Mobil with meaning, not just for looks","This is a wonderful mobile! We bought this primarily to interest our baby and help him develop but it looks good too. He loves listening to the music and watching the different shapes move. And even now at 5 months old he still loves it! We lay him down in his crib, turn on his mobile and by the end of the song he's usually asleep. When he wakes up we often find him talking to his mobile - very cute!Best Features:Colorful moving shapesNice classical songs by Mozart, Bach & BeethovenLong lasting, music plays for 15 minutes at a timeMobile arm comes off so you can keep the music box on crib."
1,BEWARE,This product would be great if it actually worked up to par. The spinning is tempermental and the motor is loud when it does turn. I exchanged the first one and the girls at the store said this product is often exchanged and always for the same reason. You are better off getting the mobile to match your nursery and purchasing baby einstein along with a cd player for the nursery.
1,Disappointing,"I bought this because it plays for 15 minutes and my wind up only lasted for about 2 minutes before I had to go wind it up again. I also thought you couldn't go wrong with classical music. I expected that they would have chosen better known songs than what they did; I don't like any of the 3 songs. The mobile circles around on a slant, and they have 3 pieces on each arm that slide up and down as it goes around. They make a scraping noise that my husband and I did not care for at all. It was also not as easy to attach securely to the crib - the top piece (the yellow hook) is flexible and does not stay hooked over the crib as well as other mobiles. The motor is also rather loud. I returned this and bought a different type. My son liked it, but he likes his new one too."
4,It's nice,"This is a nice mobile because of the bright colors and the classical music plays for quite a while. I have the one with the remote control and you can use the remote from outside the room. I do not like that the music is not a piano like it was composed. It is like keyboard music with some high pitches that are disturbing. Also, the mobile has some little pieces that are meant to move around but when they do, they make a falling noise which startles my little one. I do like that you can take the mobile off and just leave the music box though. I plan to put the mobile part in the car for future entertainment after 5 months which is when it is recommended to take it away."
2,Looks great but doesn't work so great,"Wonderful design - very fascinating shapes, but the rotation motor quit after only a few months. We have twins and bought two mobiles, and both quit the same week. Our twins are now six months old - just big enough to really enjoy the motion, and now they only have music. Big disappointment."
2,Broke too quickly!,"We bought this mobile for my daughter when she was born. My daughter loved it! She was fascinated by it, and the music was very nice.The problem? It broke in less than a month! The music still played, but the mobile no longer spun. We went out and bought another one, since my daughter loved it so much, and it too broke within a week.While we loved the mobile, a child's product that breaks twice in month is not worth the money! We talked to many friends and family members who had the same problem with the mobile. We filed a complaint with the manufacturer and never received a response."
3,Great Mobile - Bad Motor,"My son LOVED this mobile! It was a dream come true - I could get work done and it would often settle him when he was fussy too! He was almost always captivated by it and it was wonderful.However, three or four weeks into owning the product, the motor completley failed. The mobile just hung there but the music played. Very disappointing! After coming here and reading that others had similar problems I broke down and just exhanged it for another brand. I can only hope that the new brand will be reliable AND as captivating for the baby...."
1,I've had 3 of these things break in less than 2 months...,"Although my son loves this mobile, we have now been through 3 in 2 months. Really, it's been less than that b/c for the first 6 weeks we really didn't use it. This past time I brought it back to BRU, and it worked for 4 days. The mobile will not turn but the music plays. I have tried calling Tiny Love at 1-888-TINYLOVE and always get a message that says ""Our offices are now closed. Our normal business hours are Mon-Fri 8-5, blah blah blah"" but this message is ALWAYS on. I have never been able to reach them even when I call during business hours. I am furious at this so called company's complete lack of customer service. I am now going to take it higher at BRU. They should not be carrying a product of such poor quality. PLEASE read all of the reviews below about the product not working before you buy it!!! Notice everyone either gives it a 5 or a 1 b/c it would be a great product if it WORKED!"
5,INVALUABLE,"We were at a friend's home and when my 8 week old stared at this mobile for 40 (yes, FORTY) minutes, I immediately went and bought one. I can get so much done in 40 minutes!! Even when it turns off and quits moving, he will stare for 20 minutes or so! It does not match my nursery at all, but 40 minutes is worth a million dollars!! My motor is not noisy at all, maybe they have corrected this problem."
4,Great First Toy!,This mobile has so many ways to keep our baby's attention. He enjoys when it is on and when it is off. It is one of the only things that interested him for the first few months. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that it goes through batteries and you have to take the mobile off the crib to change the batteries so there is room for improvement. I highly recommend it though. We received it as a gift and really enjoy it.
2,dangerous,"I bought this item for my grandchild after reading reviews about it. I never placed the mobile directly over the baby's head because I felt aprehensive having something hanging over her head so I placed it midway the crib. The first time the mobile fell I thought maybe I didn't lock it in properly. I moved it to the foot of the crib and after the fifth time I turned it onit fell again. I heard the baby screaming in fright, the mobile had fallen on her. I am in the process of returning it to Toys R Us. The next mobile I buy, will be something made of soft material. I would warn anyone who may be thinking about buying this product to beware!!!!!!!"
3,"great buy, but........","We baught this mobile for our son when he was almost two months old, and from the start he was mesmerized by it. The music is great for putting him to sleep, in fact he is almost two and he STILL needs the music to fall asleep with! We take the music box with us on vacations, to grandmas for late night dates, EVERYWHERE he will be sleeping in an unfamiliar room!!! The batteries do need replaced everyfew months, but big woop. Our problem was that one day the mobile stopped working. It wouldn't turn at all. We tried replacing the batteries... nothing.All in all it is a worthwhile buy, I will still buy a new one for my next child, but I will keep my reciept so it can be replaced if it breaks!!!"
1,Not as great as you might think.,We registered for this and thought we were lucky to receive it. After putting it together (it is very large) and turning it on for a test run we were very disappointed. The mobile makes noise while turning (clicking) and was very distracting. The mobile also gets stuck and makes a grinding noise until it gets going again. Needless to say - we returned it.
5,Worth the money!,"I'm a bargain shopper and rarely pay full price for anything, but I caved to the advertising and bought this mobile. It was so worth it! My son LOVES it. While he was an infant, he would watch, smile, kick, reach and keep himself entertained for 30 minutes at a time. Now he's a toddler and it isn't in his crib, but we set it up in his playroom and he still loves it."
5,MOST FAVORITE TOY IN THE NURSERY!,"A friend of mine advised me to register for the Symphony-In-Motion mobile as opposed to the one that matched the bedding - I cannot thank her enough. My daughter is 4 months old and loves her mobile. Since the day we brought her home, she has been fascinated by the shapes and colors. If I need to put her down to do something, I can plan on 15 minutes of her amazement under the mobile. She smiles, laughs, kicks, and cooes and gets upset sometimes if you pick her up when she is in the middle of play time with the mobile. More than the swing, the floor gym, and the bouncy seat - she loves that mobile!"
2,Please redesign w/ more batteries!,Our twin daughters loved this as we did but the batteries don't last very long and you have to unscrew the whole thing and take it down to change them. We finally just stopped using the music because it was too much trouble changing the batteries.
1,Motor broke,"I put this mobile on my registry because it looked appealing for a baby and got great reviews. Our son liked it, but after about 15 uses for about 10 minutes at a time, the motor broke. It was very disappointing."
1,"Sorry, not real","This was supposed to have been released after the Dinosaur Adventure 3D single, but it was scrapped and was never released, not even as a promo. Should you ever see someone claiming to have a copy or is trying to sell a copy, they are lying to you."
4,The Pleasures of Wine,You had better bone up on your wine language before attempting to keep up with author Gerald Asher. This book takes you on a journey through wine country. Along the way you meet several friends within the wine industry. Asher does a great job of spinning an interesting story while giving you small doses of wine education at the same time.
2,LOOOONG SHIPMENT,"I ordered this book on October 24th and paid instantly through my credit card, I am in an accelerated course which started on October 26th and the first assignment wasn't until like November 1st...I didn't receive the item until November 14th! Wow, Now I'm two weeks behind and luckily I was able to wing it for two weeks and still maintain an A...If you are going to order give them at least a month to ship it out.Ordered October 24thRecieved Nov. 14th"
1,not Hard..not Good,"This game is very limited. There was supposed to be a website where you could download added features. But the original company sold, so no extras."
5,Haunting,"This book is about US history outside the indicated time span, but it could be woven into a Civil War discussion, for example. This book is about the 200 black pilots licensed in 1939 and additional Blacks who were trained through legislation allowing college student pilot training and preparation for the US Army Air Corps.This book explains how when Blacks could become military pilots in 1941, the Air Corps set up training at the Tuskegee Institute for 12 Black college grads. There were 5 men who graduated and became officers and others followed (996 graduated). Their performance was equal to or better than their white counter-parts.After success in shooting down German planes in 1944, they received national recognition through newsreels. 450 men were sent overseas, 66 killed in action, more than 100 received special honors, and then they returned to segregation and second-class citizenship."
4,A small triumph for art-folkies who are tired of cute music.,"This album was supposed to be Daniel Smith's Magnum Opus, and though it's hard to say if it's his best work, it is certainly the most theatrical Danielson (famile, brother, etc) release I have heard. I love the dynamics on this album, and while the persistent gang vocals on the album make it easier to digest, they don't detract from the beauty and cleverness of the composition. It has garnered alot of attention for the guest artists involved (I'm not dropping names here, that's a magazines job), but the beauty of it is Daniel's eclectic arrangements. The music is solid. Nothing technical, but very creative directional shifts throughout. It may take more than one listen, but the subtleties of this album are extremely rewarding. the best part is that they don't substitue schtick for substance anywhere on the album. It never digresses into cheap pop or filler material. A very enjoyable, unique work."
4,An acquired taste ...,"I have listened to this album several times now and I'm still getting used to the style of performance, definitely an acquired taste. One note: track #4 (Did I Step On Your Trumpet) is such a wonderfully bizarre song that it sounds like it should be used in one of Tim Burton's animated gothic movies. A great great track. Worth the price of the entire album."
3,Equal parts hit and miss,"First, I do like this album. You'll find a number of melodically pleasing tracks here. There are a couple of problems, though, that can make listening a grating chore.First, is that danged voice! Take Devendra Banhart's exaggerated vibrato at his Tiny Tim worst, then add a little nails on chalkboard timbre, and you have an inkling of Daniel's singing style. OK, I just shuddered there for a moment.Secondly, there are the harsh arrangements bordering on cacophony. Some comparisons have been made to Sun Ra, but see, where I come from that's a bad thing.It's not all bad, of course. Some of these compositions are fun and catchy and work overall, but I suspect the average devotee will be filtering out about half of the tracks.Still, I'm OK with having spent my shells on the album."
3,Very helpful to me,"It has been a while since I purchased this book, but at the time, I was attempting to build a website, and it was very helpful. I used a template, but this helped me correct some of the errors that were in the template. With all the improvements and changes in computers since my purchase, I suppose the book is a little obsolete by now, but I got my money's worth when I needed it!"
2,embroidered logo,"I bought three shirts for my son-in-law. Each shirt had a Walls logo embroidered on the upper center back in a very obvious place. Anywhere else would have been more appropriate. As it is, I think he will trade them for another size and a different brand."
2,nice looking but cheaply made,"I got one of these at a local store because it looks very nice (also bought one in a nickel hinge finish). They are cheaply made, though. The bolts holding the seat to the toilet do not stay tight, so expect to have to get down and tighten them regularly. Eventually the mdf cannot handle all of the shifting due to the bolt problem, so it starts disintigrating where the hinges are screwed into the seat. At this point you will need to purchase a new toilet seat (I even tried to use wood glue to keep them in place, but that only worked for a bit). Also, heavy duty bathroom cleaners stain the finish, ruining a once-beautiful seat."
1,terrible,I had to return this product. It was not the size it claimed to be and the hinges were flimsy.
1,Cracks easy.,"Because the bolts holding the seat to the toilet do not stay tight, if you do not tighten them regularly the seat cracks. Amazon replaced the first one after itCracked in 4 days , but the second one also cracked shortly after getting it because we didn't tighten it up every other day."
5,It is oil rubbed,"This is GREAT quality. Makes the whole toilet look more expensive. Yes, it's oil rubbed and not antique. However, the metal is such a small part of the piece that it blends well with both if you are using antique brass on other fixtures."
2,BLATANT DISNEY WORLD COMMERCIAL,"Mickey loses a special hat so of course Mickey and Minnie have to go EVERYWHERE in Disney World to look for it. It does have Mickey, Minnie, Donald & Daisy and Goofy. I suppose its a good book if you want to get your kid acquainted with the place because you are about to visit. But speaking as a parent who doesn't have any plans to go to Disney World in the near future, it makes me mad. When I sit down to read to my son I do not expect the entire book to be one stupid commercial!"
3,Okay,I have had other Yoga product and this was okay. I expected something a little different because I have used other Yoga products before. Would still purchase from this seller again.
5,This is REALLY for those with back problems!,"I like this DVD and I like Peggy Cappy! Why? The instructions are clear. There are no distractions. The DVD is broken into smaller increments, so you can do a warm up and one or two other sections. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who needs strengthening exercises for the back. It may be too slow for those with experience, but if you have back problems, you might want to or need to slow down to strengthen the muscles around your spine. I can't say enough good about this DVD!"
5,Love it,"Very helpful for my back. Easy to do, not too strenuous. The cool down part is VERY relaxing. You'll like it."
3,OK for beginners,This DVD is OK for beginners but not challenging enough for anyone who have practiced yoga even for a short time. Soothing voice. The moves are basic but could be more advanced. If you're looking for a real workout try another DVD. If you're new to yoga it's OK but could have some more of the basic poses.
5,Yoga for the Rest of Us Back Care Basics,"I found this Yoga DVD excellent and I have not done much Yoga in my life but gradually my body has felt much better and I can feel the improvement every day.I also bought Yoga for Arthritis which is very good also and I do one or the other every day. This is not for the young that are fit and been doing Yoga but for the rest of us. Peggy Cappy is a wonderful teacher. Pat W. Yarmouth, MA"
5,Yoga for the Rest of Us Back Care Basics,I love this DVD. I have fibromyalgia and my muscles are very stiff. Didn't think I could ever do yoga. This DVD shows modifications to poses to help people who are less flexible. It is also divided into sections so you can do however many sections you have time or energy for.
5,LOVE this! Beginner Heaven!,"I chose this DVD to inspire me to do the daily PT that my back needs after surgery. Peggy does a WONDERFUL job, leading even the novice through each pose, with variations for different levels. She gives you plenty of time to work into each pose and reminds you about every inhale and exhale! It has been 9 days and I am totally addicted! And this from someone who hates to exercise!!!! I can already feel the difference in my back: less pain and more stamina!"
4,Back exercises,The DVD is good. Some of the exercises are the same ones I have used in therapy. The dvd is easy to listen too.
5,AS always.. this CD kicks butt.. love it,"Had to buy it again as mine is in storage and I needed it right away.This is the best back therapy I have ever used..It is easy, you do the first part on your back. Legs up the wall is marvelous.Peggy really gets it for us older folk who need back care.. hahaha.Love it."
2,Please stop talking!!!,"It took me 30 mins. to get to a work-out... I'm sorry, I'm a busy person... I just want to get to the heart of the matter. Show me the yoga for gods sake! the workout was easy and I understood what to do by watching the video..."
4,Taking the mystery out of yoga,"At last, a yoga DVD that actually takes the time to show you how to get into and out of the various poses. I am retired, and yoga was suggested by my doctor as a good way to stretch my muscles in addition to other exercises. I appreciated the time that Peggy took to demonstrate how to get into and out of the various poses, and I loved the absence of the ubiquitous New Age music so common in these videos. This is a real beginners video, and very appropriate for seniors who may lack flexibility. If you have never done yoga, I highly recommend it."
5,Getting started with Yoga,"I am a super-busy teacher, but I definitely need more exercise. This video is giving me a way to improve my physical being and enjoy doing it. I love it!Sonia"
5,Good stretching exercises and easy to follow,"Back Care Basics is a good, easy to follow stretching exercises. It arrived promptly and was a new product. I would recommend this site and the CD to anyone as we all can use stretching."
2,Canon i850 photo is not a photo printer.,"I have a Canon S750 and it is a wonderful product if you're printing simple docuements, banners, and flyers. I thought that the Canon i850 would make a great addition as a photo printer but I was mistaken.First, the Canon i850 is a fast, affordable, bubblejet printer on it's own. I like it for the individual think tanks that minimize trips to the store for the ink. With that said, it is not different from my Canon S750 as a printer other than the speed and some resolution. Unlike the other photo printers by Epson and HP, this Canon ""photo"" printer only uses 4 colors and that seems to make a great differnt as I noticed it on my 9 year old nephew's Epson 820 printer. That 80 dollar printer clearly outshines this Canon though it is a ink hog.I wish that Canon would make a printer to rival HP and Epson in quality and the number of pigments used to print photos. The i850 is clearly a great printer for everyday use, but it is not a photo printer."
1,"Slow, erratic paper feed","We own a Canon i850 and were pleased with the price. Initially. But once we used it regularly, we found that the paper feed is erratic and we have to babysit print jobs to make sure the paper is feeding. This occurs when the paper supply is full, nearly empty and all points in between. We also find that the printer is slow and that we have problems with ink cartridges not working, even when new."
3,Canon i850 is just ok,"When my HP 895 bit the dust, I replaced it with the Canon i850 because I liked the idea of separate ink cartridges. I've had the Canon for about a month, and so far, the cartridges are holding out. However, I'm disappointed with the photo print quality compared to my old HP. With the HP, I got true photo quality. The Canon just doesn't quite measure up. I wish I liked it better because I'm going to be using it for a long time, but the print quality just isn't there."
1,Worst money on a printer you can buy,"I purchased this printer a year ago at Best buy for around 150 dollars. Since then it has worked fine and i was happy with it, up until now. Today it starting printing some weird streaks all over pictures, and i ran the clean print head option at least 6 times and it still prints the ugly green lines across the page.I thought Canon would make a decent printer, but they have provem me wrong and I will never purchase one again."
5,Great for printing photos (8x10) and pics,"Just bought it. It was a breeze to install. Prints great 8x10 photos on matte paper. Normal text printing is quite fast as well. Recommend for home use. Remember to set the paper type before you print photos, otherwise you get messed up photos. Definately better than the HP Photosmart 100 that I bought last year. Printer technology is improving dramatically. Good ink system, that will hopefully save me some money. With HP, U have to junk the entire cartridge, even if a single color is out. Canon has 4 ink system with visual indicators. so you buy just the one you need. Plus Canon ink cartrdiges are cheaper than HPs. This one does not have a memory stick interface, so you will need a computer to print. With my 5 mb Sony digital camera, and this printer, I hardly use my 35 mm SLR camera anymore."
5,Look no further...,"For home use, this printer does it all! You may have read the editorial reviews stating that the text quality is lacking, but I can tell no difference ,using a magnifier, between the text from the i850 and the laser printers at the office. The photo quality is outstanding! Everyone I show the pics to is amazed. As for the ability to print directly from the memory card? Come on, do you really want to spend the money on ink and paper before cropping or scrutinizing the picture for lighting, focus, defects?? To me this is the biggest benefit of a photo printer, being able to print only the photos that turned out. Otherwise, it's more economical to go to a photo lab. I think that option is only good for the ""gee whiz"" factor. For the money, you can't go wrong with the i850."
2,Canon Screw-Up,"This printer has the worst backloading mechanism. The paper jams. The printer prints everything out of margin. Bad design work. The quality of the print isn't that good easier. A lot of visible ""printer"" lines. I trust Canon with cameras, but sure won't buy a printer from them anymore."
3,Figured out how to do 5X7 prints,"This printer turns out excellent photos, and the print head hasn't died yet, but I haven't used it as much as some people might. I tried all day today to figure out how to do 5X7's and discovered that if I put the jpeg photo into Photoshop and size it to 5X7, it will print at that size on a ""letter"" sized piece of photo paper. However, you end up wasting a lot of paper because you have to cut the 5X7 from the paper. What was I thinking, buying a printer that didn't print 5X7's? What was Canon thinking, making a printer like that. I'll be darn sure next time that I have the flexibility I need in a printer."
5,Much better than HP!,"I orginally bought an HP...kept jamming so I took it back. The clerk at Best Buy recommeded the Canon i850, and I'm glad he did! The photo quality is excellent, you cannot distinguish from a lab! Also prints very fast for text or photos. I think this printer would be very hard to beat for the price! Fantastic."
4,"Not perfect, but prints very well.","Makes a loud whirring noise when beginning a printout. Makes a similar noise between subsequent pages. It is quiet as it is actually printing. But between pages, it's kinda noisey. You can hear the motor and the rollers as it spits out each page. Text quality is fine in spite of what some people have said. With black & white text in draft mode, the text is good... clear and sharp. But any ""colored"" text or text imbeded within color graphics is not as sharp in draft mode. In fact, the text can be rather jagged. This can easily be corrected by switching to a higher quality setting. Photos are pretty awesome. 4 x 6's look like they came from a lab. I have only used Canon photo paper for photos. So, I can't make a judgement on other papers. May not be the quietest printer around. But for the price, it would be hard to beat the i850."
5,oldie but goodie,"I bought my first i850 when they were the latest and greatest and had many, many years of wonderful service. It finally gave up the ghost in 2009. I dragged my feet purchasing a new printer because I'd just bought a case of ink for this specific printer, but also because this was such a great printer. Finally found one, new, still in box, and snagged it in a heartbeat. Got it set up and running, and it's every bit as good as the first one was. I hope I get as many years or at least as many prints out of it as the first one gave me."
5,Great printer!,I did a lot of research before purchasing this printer. Once I got it I was not disappointed. It was easy to install and setup. It works great with Windows XP. The output is sharp and clear. It prints much quicker than I anticipated.
2,too much trouble,"We had this printer for about 3 years. When it is working well, it works well. On the other hand, a small amount of dust in the printer caused horrible smudging and ruined photos. Impossible to clean. No instructions for cleaning the inside of the printer to stop smudging. I managed to wipe some out with my finger the first time, but that didn't last long as now it is doing it again and I can't see anything in there (yes we close the covers on a regular basis), so must be something stuck on the print head itself. No way to get under there. Also we have had to constantly realign this thing for some reason, and visible lines were a problem. We aren't computer experts, just regular people who want to print at home without problems. This printer has too many issues. Also it takes a long time to get going when you are waiting to print something and is very noisy."
5,I want to completent my previous review (see above),"Today I ran another EXTREME test: printed out photograph on photo paper, and immediately after printing, opened water in the bathroom and washed picture while rubbing it with hands, and, oh miricle, picture didn't get washed away. In fact, there was no discoloration of ink bleeding whatsoever!!! The paper gets wet, but picture stays on, as clear as before!!! You know what this means: you can print bumber stickers, posters and more!!!Way to go, Canon! This printer is best buy I ever made!"
1,Bad Printer Head,After 12 months of use the printer head went bad. I had problems with printing the color red. I've bought Canon printers in the past and really liked them but this is a bummer ... I'll think twice before I get another one.
2,Print head failed after 10 months,I was very happy with the i-850 during the time that it worked. it was mostly used for text documents during the 10 month period with the occasional photo print. But recently it started printing streaks on photo prints and as of late it just tosses blank pieces of paper (even though I've been only using Canon certified ink tanks since the beginning and the current tanks inside are brand new). My last two printers were also Canons (S750 and a older model from 2000) and had the almost same symptoms.
2,Disappointed,Was excited to get this in the mail for a gift for my mother-in-law. The birdhouse I got did not look like the one online. Pieces had fallen off when I opened the package and the house was not completely covered in seed. Not worth the price.
1,Birds never touched it!!!,"The amount I paid for this item and the quality of this item has left me greatly disappointed! I gave this item as a gift to my husband for Christmas and he has been very unimpressed with how the item worked. There has not been one single bird that has come anywhere near this feeder. Now it sits all rotten on our bird hanger and even when I tried to put peanut butter and add more seed to see it this would attract birds, it did not work. The feeder ended up being a huge sticky mess. I will not purchase anything like this again on-line!"
1,Wimpy,"I assumed that because it was a KitchenAid it was a quality appliance. WRONG, this thing can barely handle cake batter, anything heavier and it bogs down. The high speed is really not very fast even with no load so whipping is slow. My $25 Hamilton Beach runs circles around this mixer."
1,Disappointed,"Although nice in appearance, this unit was lightweight, flimsy, inferior quality beaters and weak performance. I was hoping for more from this brand...will continue shopping for a better solution."
1,Poor product,"I purchased this to replace a generic hand mixer that my mother gave to me second-hand years ago. I wish I had never given up that old mixer. This Kitchen Aid has been a disappointment-no power and the beaters have shifted so that they interfere with each other as they turn. I e-mailed the company, and the only response that I received was a generic 'thank you' for purchasing their product. $45 wasted. Next time I will not buy on name recognition alone!"
2,Doesn't live up to the name,"Absolutely no power. I can't stand it. I thought I couldn't go wrong with a Kitchen Aid product, but I was sure wrong about this one. Every speed us pretty much the same. I cannot even get my mashed potatoes smooth. I've had it for a few months now trying to convince myself it was worth the higher price I paid, but it definitely is not. I have a Kitchen Aid stand mixer and I love it. Why is the portable mixer so wimpy? I'm very disappointed with this product."
4,loose beater,i have owned this modle fr a few years and bake frequently. my only complaint with the mixer was the left beater would no longer stay in the mixer--the locking mechanism failed and i could not get that repaired. what a shame to spend $40 plus for a new mixer just because the beater won't stay in......
1,Horrible mixer,"This is the first review I've ever written, but I felt strongly enough about this mixer to speak up! It's very disappointing. I used it once for a soft chocolate chip cookie dough. Even on speed 5 (which isn't much different than speed 1) it's pretty weak, and one of the prongs of one beater broke. Even before the beater broke, something about the design made dough splatter outside of the bowl, which is something I never experienced with other hand-held mixers. I used to make cookies all the time with my old mixer and never had a problem. I'll be returning this."
1,Very disappointing,"I purchased the Kitchen-Aid hand mixer based on a great experience with an earlier model purchased many years ago, but this one was an extreme disappointment. Instead of a sturdy mixer with lots of horsepower, I ended up with a light-weight plastic casing and thin beaters. My test for a hand mixer is the standard - chocolate chip cookie dough... and this mixer in no way held up. An email to the company asking why they had ""downsized"" a much less robust appliance gave a less than satisfactory response. There must be a more hardy hand mixer out there, so keep looking."
4,Christmas gift,"I purchased this mixer for my girlfriend and she loves it. We have a stand mixer, but she wanted a handheld for smaller baking. Great mixer!"
2,No power,Mixer worked OK at first. Began losing power on simple jobs. Didn't last 2 months. Very disappointed. This would have been my 2nd one. The 1st one lasted over 15 years. Fan finally gave out. This new one was not nearly as sturdy as 1st one. Seemed to be very cheaply made. Is this what you would call progress!! I am going to try the Cuisinart.
2,Batter spatters out and makes too much of a mess,I have found this mixer works well for mixing and is easy to clean but I have to replace it because it makes the batter fly out of the bowl. When mixing I MUST cover the mixer and bowl with a towel or else I have a fair amount of clean-up. I hold it very steady and straight to minimise the mess. My 4yo is ready to help with baking but the mess this mixer makes means it is impossible for me to let him mix because the batter get EVERYWHERE!I have had this for a couple of years and have finally gotten sick of it. It was comfy to hold and seemed sturdy enough but I do NOT recommend this because of the spattering of the batter.
2,CAN'T WHIP EGG WHITES! not enough speed :-(,"A brand I trust, but sadly a model that fails to perform a basic task well: whipping egg whites. It sounds, looks and just ""is"" too slow while whipping the whites and took me almost 2x longer than the old KitchenAid mixer that I replaced."
3,beater,"The wire rods were much thinner than I expected.The strength of the motor is fine, I would have liked heavier rods."
2,Beaters broke,"Like many others, the beaters broke rather quickly on my hand mixer - in about a year of light use. I tried repairing them with gorilla glue and Super glue, but with no luck. The beaters on my old mixer, which finally burned out after 25 years, were still in perfect shape when I had to get rid of them - I wonder why Kitchen Aid can't make beaters that last more than a year. Kitchen Aid wants $15 plus shipping for replacements - what a racket. I found them on Amazon for about $10 with shipping - still too much for something that shouldn't break."
4,Great so far!,"Bought this after looking at various reviews. Have only used it once so far, to blend batter for pumpkin quick bread. Did the job just fine, seemed plenty fast to me, and I had no problem using it in my steel mixing bowl. Haven't tried the dough hooks or blender stick thingie yet; I expect the blender stick thingie (can't remember what they call it, obviously) to work just fine on smoothies, etc., but I'm not sure this thing has enough power to knead bread dough - if I try that, I'll come back to let you know.Also I got all the right parts in the box; I see some people say they didn't. I'm considering adding the balloon whisk, which is supposed to add more volume to things like egg whites than you can get using a hand whisk because of the added speed.Gave it four stars only because I haven't really put it through its paces yet, having used it only once, but I'm quite satisfied with what I see and how it works so far."
3,Low Power No Power,You would think with the name of KitchenAid this would be a well performing mixer.Wrong.There is hardly a difference between low speed and high when mixing.I have used this to make mashed potatoes and from that experience would not even try to mix a heavier cookie dough.I have an old GE 3 speed hand mixer that's heads above this.
2,Mixer is a dud,"I purchased this item because I thought the name KitchenAid would automatically mean quality. Boy, was I wrong. I, like the other folks who have tried to make mashed potatoes with this mixer have been extremely disappointed. They always come out lumpy. Always. I don't know if it is because the mixer lacks power or if it is because the beaters don't have the metal rod going down the center of the beater. Something just doesn't cut it. I have to say, I love my KitchenAid stand mixer, but I don't like this hand-held mixer at all."
1,mixers fell apart after only a few years of use,The metal mixers completely broke after only 2 years of purchase. I only used the mixer a handful of times. Do yourself a favor and pick a different brand.
1,Died after maybe 10 uses.,"I contacted Kitchen Aid to tell them my mixer expired after using several times. I thought they might at least tell me where I could fix it, or what the problem, that numerous other reviewers, just like me had with the same appliance. They could care less. All I got was their latest offers on other products. No more Kitchen Aid appliances for us."
3,Disappointing,"I replaced my Cuisinart 5 speed with this KitchenAid, I am extremely disappointed in its performance. It doesn't have half the power of the Cuisinart in my opinion, yes it doesn't start off so fast that it throws stuff out of the mixing bowl, but that's because it just doesn't have the power to do that anyway on any speed. I thought my first experience may have been deceptive since it was a thick batter, but when I mixed a thinner batter, the results were the same, no power. I wish that I had invested the additional money to buy the Cuisinart."
3,"Decent, with some drawbacks","I have owned this hand mixer for almost 8 years now, and in general I am satisfied with it. Like others have said, there is not much difference in power between the lowest and highest settings. My biggest complaint is that it came with one set of thin wire beaters. These work fine for most jobs, but the thin beaters combined with the low power are a problem when it comes to whipping egg whites. This is so frustrating! I have to save my old mixer just for this one job. My 20+ year old hand mixer can whip egg whites to stiff peaks in 2-3 minutes, this KitchenAid mixer will NEVER whip egg whites to stiff peaks."
2,same problem as others who purchased,"i found the same problem as others, the beater remained attached for maybe 10 uses. this is the second mixer of this model which has had this problem. i would not buy this ever again. i also have a Woflgang Puck model with 3 beaters which is far superior for about the same price. sad part is my daughter who has little money saved up to buy this as a gift."
2,Beaters broke after 18 months of use.,"Am I disappointed! My son got into the habit of making cakes and cookies a year or so ago, so we got a reliable brand (Kitchenaid) hand mixer.At first I thought it odd that the first speed didn't seem all that much slower than the highest speed.But then last week my son was mixing chocolate chip cookie dough and the tines on one of the beaters just sheared off!So today I'm making some gingersnap cookies with the one remaining beater, and zing! the last beater shears apart.I went looking for some replacement beaters, but with the $15 cost and $7 shipping, it'll be $23. And those will last approximately 18 months.I think I'll check the thrift stores and estate sales to see if I can pick up an old Sunbeam mixer for a few bucks. My mom had one for forty years and it worked like a champ.What's the world coming to when you spend $50 and get a product so cheap it self destructs in less than two years? Shame on you KitchenAid!No more cheapie KitchenAid mixers for me!"
1,Piece of junk,"Could you make mixer even slower. I guess not. It cannot raise even egg-nog. It is painfully slow. I understand that has only five speeds and there other more advanced models. But does car that has four speed transmission has mas speed 40 m/h?WHere is ""Ultra - Power""? What actually they meant by this?Stay away from this mixer."
5,Great for Research Papers,"I found this book incredibly useful for a recent research paper I had to complete on Shakespeare's Othello. It details the themes, imagery, and characters of Shakespeare's greatest tragedy, Othello. You may also want to check out A.C. Bradley's Shakespearean Tragedy and Bloom's Iago, both wonderful literary criticisms with some focus on Othello."
4,Great product,I have never been disappointed with Bondhus products of which I have several. I received it fast from amazon as usual. It worked as I expected. I have used it several times with good results.
4,Ok Salsa,"Certainly not the best, can't beat fresh made....the Peach is the best one of the lot followed by the charred. The green is not to my liking."
1,broke,This product we thought was going to solve our spillage problems but.......it didnt!!!! It broke right out of the package. =( Frustrated!!!!!!!
1,Stupidest design ever,"So this is how it works:There is a little ball in the little tube you see there. The ball floats. So, as the water level rises to the top, the ball rises to plug the hole. Simple right?Unfortunately, this product's purpose is to hold back five gallons of water. You simply can't carry that much water without bobbing up and down/swishing the water back and forth. This causes the ball to move around and water splashes out. As the water level lowers, so does the ball, thus making the cap completely useless. Enjoy having water shoot up in your face with every step!Also, the wings on the side(to help remove the cap), although helpful, did not fit in my water cooler. I had to cut them off."
1,No Splash Cap for gallon water containers,The cap didn't fit on my Arrowhead water bottles. I was so disappointed. I was so excited for it to work and no longer make the big mess that I normally make.
2,Love the robe BUT zipper broke 1st time I wore it,"This was exactly what I had been looking for. Long enough, light weight, attractive, and very comfortable. However the zipper broke the first time I wore it. The zipper will not stay closed. Pops apart in several locations every time I zip it. I had thrown away the packaging, etc so I did not return it.So right now the robe is pretty much useless unless I want to pay to have another zipper put in."
1,Plisse Robe,This product came with a broken zipper. I didn't realize it until a few week after purchase when I first wore it. Very disappointing.
4,Long Robe,Bought for my Mom.She really likes it.She wears long loungers every dayand likes this one better then some she has.
2,problematic,The zipper does not work well. It opens up as soon as you try to zip it closed. I have to discard this item as a result.
4,Nice summer robe!,"I purchased this robe for my mother-in-law and she loves it! It is well made and has pockets, which is a must for her. The pastel colors are very flattering. I would recommend this for anyone who enjoys a long cotton robe."
3,Not as good as I thought it would be,"I am 38 and like to color as a way to relax after a busy day, my 12 year old son enjoys coloring with me. We like to use permanent markers because the colors come out so vivid on the pages when we are done. We copy the pages out of the book on our printer so we can reuse the original pictures over and over without having to buy more books; we have five different books like these all by different companies. I only gave this book three stars because there were too many pages with just straight lines in different ""basket weave"" designs. I like pictures that have a mixture of lines, circles, wavy lines, etc. but there were only two pictures in this book that had that so I was disappointed."
5,Crafting Fiction has something for every writer,"Diogenes and Moneybun's ""Crafting Fiction"" is a wonderful book for those who need to get to the nitty gritty of writing. You can learn something of value to the writer on every page.I've found all the tips to be useful and insightful. This is a very accessible and worthwhile text. It was required reading in three of my college fiction classes.Kit in St. Louis"
1,Out to Lunch,"I am deeply worried that rubbish such as this is allowed to go into print. The two authors, neither of whom are historians, do not seem to have the remotest understanding of Scottish history (or American) and make many errors and idiotic statements. In particular, I am utterly gob-smacked that the authors are so dismissive - no, downright rude - when referring to Edward J. Cowan's book, 'For Freedom Alone: The Declaration of Arbroath' - and yet go on to quote large passages from it without proper referencing. Cowan, who is the professor of Scottish History at University of Glasgow in the UK has written a far superior book and deserves more respect from these authors.All I can say is stick to law, boys, as you know nothing about history!!"
4,"high intensity, great playing, but..","Danny Gatton is one of the most amazing guitarists ever, but he doesn't have the experience of playing over the encyclopedic bop-inflected chord substitutions, that dedicated jazzers like DeFrancesco have. His ear, chops, tone, and energy make up for 95% , but this cd is not for jazz guitar fans. To hear a guitarist known in country circles who also had total success in jazz, get the double cd: 'MOVE, The Guitar Artistry of Hank Garland'."
4,Good Buddhist stories for bedtime,"I wish I liked this book more. The illustrations are great and contemporary. The stories contain values and are based on the Jakata tales of the Buddha. However, the stories themselves are a bit short, reminiscent of Aesop's fables. My personal feelings are that more character development and detail are needed to expand on the stories. HOWEVER, this is a GREAT resource for Buddhist parents to read to their kids at bedtime. I really wish and encourage there to be more books along these lines. We need to teach our children how to be better human beings. This is more important than anything else. This book helps move in that direction."
4,good product,Good product for the price. These hinges are now holding up my bedroom door. Look okay and work okay. The previous mortise hinges were antique ball and pin hinges from the 1930's. They were really nice but had been painted over so many times I had to go with the modern hinge.
5,you guys don't get it.,"The first reviews are stupid as hell, you dumb asses! This is not a CD for people who listen to beats and think about shaking thier asses! Nitin has taken it to another level, a level that will be hard to understand until you ""listen"" to the music. Think of Indian Fusion music and we are now surrounded with the same type of crap, this one is a leader in the industry and only makes sense if you know Indian Fusion, its not about spiritual coolness and lounging with a spliff, its music on a different tip. Buy it, listen, and enjoy!"
3,Disappointing,"This album is much in the same vein as ""Prophesy"" (5 stars for music, minus one for irritating sound clips), but somehow it just doesn't grab me as much. More of the same, and an obvious follow-up album. I've played the disc now several times, and none of the songs sticks in my memory. The hooks are not as catchy, and the sound is more uniform. If you're looking to buy your first Nitin Sawhney album, go for Prophesy instead."
3,One was deformed,One of the eyedroppers was bent (it still kinda worked) and the other one was good.
4,A fun product,"It does what it promises and more. If you purchase earphones which cover the entire ear to cut out background noise, and if you get a ""Y"" adapter, two people can watch a DVD at the same time in a noisy environment."
2,The mobile dies on you!!!!!!!!!!!!,"SAME thing as EVERYONE else has to say! This is the 2nd mobile we're going to exchange. Don't get me wrong, my daughter LOVES it but all of a sudden we go to replace the batteries and it stops working...we put 2 sets of batteries in so we know it wasn't that. BIG LET down. The music is great as well as the shapes and colors. Everything about it she loves, but boy will she be disappointed when she realizes that it doesnt even work. For $40, you'd think TINY LOVE would make a better product."
1,My son loves it - shame it's such a piece of junk,"My nephew loved this mobile when he was an infant, so my sister loaned it to me when my son was born. It burned out after a few weeks, but since the mobile wasn't brand new, I didn't think much of it.We ordered a new one and it, too, burned out in less than one month. It's really too bad that this is such a shoddy piece of junk. For the brief time that it did work, my son loved it.We were extremely disappointed with this product. Don't waste your money."
3,"This was GREAT, at first...","We have had similar problems as those already listed. The little shapes that are attached to the arms were too loud when they slid and kept the baby awake. We fixed that ourselves by attaching clips to keep them from moving. Then after only 6 months of normal use, the motor just simply stopped. It still plays beautiful music, so now we jsut use it as a music box. Reading other reviews, this looks like a hit or miss product, some work, some don't. Good Luck!"
2,"Bad quality music, but colorful characters.","I bought this product with such joy & expectation. I loved the design and the colorful hanging characters. But once I installed it and turned it on, I was very disappointed since the music was of such low quality that it hurt my ears! I could not stand the bad quality music and the noise that came from rotating the parts. This noise was more dominant the the music itself. I though if I cannot stand this for two minutes, how would the baby like it. I think they need to improve the quliaty of the music coming out of the box and stop those small parts sliding on the hanging wire which make so much un wanted noise."
3,"Great Idea, Poor Design","My 2 1/2 month old loves this, and it is a wonderful concept, but the construction is lacking. With the first one I received (at my shower), the whining noise was louder than the music, and then it stopped turing all together. So, took it back for another one, mobile #2, the on/off button stopped working. So back to the store for #3, again the on/off button stopped. But, my daughter loved it and I liked the concept. So I called the manufacturer. I explained the problem and they sent me a new music box, it works fine now, and apparently they have realized the problem, becuase it is slightly different. Now that they have the bugs worked out, I'd suggest this mobile to anyone."
3,Stimulating Battery eater,I agree with the other reviews regarding this mobile-It is amazing and stimulating-and keeps my baby interested when she is not ready to sleep. But my one pet peeve is the sound that it makes once the batteries start to wear out which is almost immediately. It is so loud and squeaky!! At first I thought it was broken-but I realized when I changed the batteries it went away. It eats up batteries very quickly. The noise is so irritating. But my baby does like it-but do not expect it to lull your child to sleep.
4,My 2-month old loves this mobile.,"She stares and babbles at it whenever she is awake in her crib - even when it isn't turned on. I think that the motor and music are kind of loud, but she doesn't seem to mind."
2,Disappointing quality of music and motor,"We purchased the Tiny Love mobile, but were quite disappointed in the poor quality of the classical music. It gives a distinctly out of tune, 'tinny' quality to the music.Additionally, the sound of the electic motor that powers the mobile was so loud that it overwhelms any music that's being played. Not exactly the ideal environment for a baby to fall asleep under.However, the toys were well done and are sure to entertain most babies."
3,"BABY LOVES IT, BUT....","This really is a great ""active mobile"". Our daughter loved to play with it, but the clicking of all of those little stars on the arms gets REALLY loud and annoying and is not appropriate for drifting to sleep. My husband tied them all up together with dental floss though and it was perfect!! Another big ""but"" was the fact that it stopped working and we had to exchange it for a new one...TWICE! When it stopped working we thought it was the end of the world since our daughter loved it so much. You weigh out the pros and cons and decide for your self if it is worth it!"
5,Mum's best friend,"Symphony Animal Mobile cost: $39.99Guaranteed 25 minutes to oneself: Priceless!!!!!Before I received this when my preemie daughter was 2 1/2 months old, it was very haphazard whether or not I could get a shower during the day or simply eat before noon.At 4 months, she eagerly goes into her crib first thing in the morning and I can bathe, get dressed, get the dogs outside, give them medication, and put on hot water for my tea before she loses interest in her 'buddies'. Basically all the things I cannot do with her in my arms.It's not much time for a lot of people, but for me, I feel human once more before facing another day of spit, vomit, poop, & a very wakeful baby. Completely worth the money and the time.Her other mobile is Tigger & Friends which she really adores. Unfortunately, some sadist manufactured it to last ONLY 4 1/2 minutes before running down. Has anyone tried to do anything meaningful in under 5 minutes in a 3 story house?????????????"
5,Simply the best for development,"This mobile is by far the best. We bought it for our daughter at 3 months and she was totally fascinated by it, she still loves it now at 7 1/2 months....we just had to put it up higher so she can not reach it. She loves the music and all the bright colors plus all the different endless variations of motion and patterns. Some of the other reviews say it is not so great because it is top heavy....true, but we have never touched it so it stays in 1 place. Any mobile should not be within reach of a baby so you will not have problems with this mobile. The music is great for the development of the baby, many different styles for brain development....maybe not a live recording but better than most baby toys that have ""music"". Most mobiles have only 1 look....this has many variations and so the baby will not get bored with it. Yes it is more expensive, but very educational while being extrememly cute."
2,costly at the end,even though i agree this is a great product this mobile did end up being costly i just wish someone would have mentioned how many batteries you go through per month. i use it whenever our son Dylan is in his crib or being changed or just for occasional entertainment.
2,Possible Safety Hazard,We purchased two of these mobiles for our newborn twins. The babies love them. The problem is that if the bulb is not lined up directly above the base the mobile has a tendancy to tip over. My wife went into the nursery room a few minutes after we had turned on one of the mobiles to find that it had fallen on its side and the animals were hitting our daughter's face. Our friends that have this mobile have experienced similar problems. Some cribs are more suited than others for the security of the device but all seem unstable to some degree.
2,Immobile Mobile,"The first mobile we got stopped rotating the first day we used it. We sent it back and Amazon promptly exchanged it. The second one worked properly for about a month, and has since stopped rotating. Don't know why--it's just stopped.Our son loves to look at this mobile, even though it's not moving (so technically, I guess it's not really a ""mobile""--maybe a ""stationary""?). The music part still works, and it's nice. So we won't get rid of it--but new buyers beware, this toy may have quality control problems."
3,Disappointed,"I loved this at first. It doesn't help my 3 month old sleep, its way to noisy and entertaining but it keeps him occupied in his crib so I can get dressed in the morning! He has never fallen asleep to it but loves to watch it. The sound is O.K. but gets a little grating after a while. I was pretty happy with it until it just stopped working one day. I had only had it for a month. I have a friend who's did the same thing. If you do purchase this, keep the reciept!Hopefully you wont need it but I wish I had kept mine."
2,It sounded like a good idea....but,"Yes, it was definately a distraction, but all that clicking and moving (it got on my nerves a little!), it was not soothing for an infant trying to mellow-out and get relaxed enough to go to sleep. Also the music was nice, but a little too electronic sounding. Mostly it was good for keeping the baby distracted for 15 minutes while we ate dinner. Then, after three months it stopped working. After changing the batteries several times, we gave up and by that time the baby was too old for it anyway."
2,Cute and Noisy Mobile with Too Much Hype,"... It fits only on cheep Cribs. If you have a crib rail thicker than 2"" buy something else. The music is nice, animals are cute, however the motor makes an unusual hissing sound and quite irritating. The pieces that slides up and down also makes an unpleasant noise. The company brags about how developmental this mobile is however I think the noise may actually bad for babies. I will give 4 stars for the look and 1 star for the poor construction. I will return it during the weekend.Frankly, I rather hang an umbrella upside down with some soft toys, play good music on my CD player for my baby than using this [thing].Just another too hyped Toy."
1,What a joke,"I have no idea how the other people were able to put it together. Maybe I was missing a piece. But, mine wouldn't connect."
1,Great concept-horrible construction!,"When I set this mobile up for my 2 month old son, he loved it! It is bright and colorful with moving parts that caught his attention immediately. He liked the clssical music as well. It would keep him happy the entire time he watched it!About a week after I had it the problems began. It goes through the 3 AAA batteries within a week. The motor squeals so much that I returned the first one I bought, thinking it was defective, but the second one squeals as well. Now the mobile is not turning when it is turned on- the music plays but there is no motion. The on/off switch sticks.I will return this one and try one more time, but that is it. If my son did not love it so much I would have no problem parting with this poorly constructed mobile.Great design and concept-horrible construction!"
3,This product is great at first...,"This mobile was great at first, the baby I nanny for loved it, he was mesmerized. But, it only plays for a few minutes, and after a while, the motor started making a horrible squealing sound. This product only lasted a couple months."
3,"Great at first, but. . .","I got this for my first son back in 2002. He used the mobile until he was about 9 months and then he used just the music box until he was almost 2. When my second child was born summer 2004 I put the mobile up in his crib. After turning it on only a few times it started to make a high-pitched screech that was so awful I had to turn it off. There is a problem with the mobile function and it either makes the noise while it turns or it does not turn at all. I've simply removed the mobile, but my baby did enjoy watching it so I am disappointed. My other complaint about this product is that it goes through batteries very rapidly when the mobile is attached. This was only a minor annoyance for me since both my children enjoyed watching it so much and now it isn't an issue at all since I cannot use the mobile."
2,Loved it while it lasted... don't throw away receipt,"We live in Okinawa, Japan, and received this from our relatives in the states. Our son loved it from 2 weeks of age, but less than 4 weeks later, it stopped working. The music plays, but the mobile will not spin. Tried everything to get it working again, but no success. We cannot return it from here, since we don't have a receipt and did not keep the packing slip. I would have given this 5 stars if it worked, but $40 is a lot to pay for a mobile, and not have it work. I guess we'll continue to use the ""music box"" part of it, since we are unable to return it."
2,Loved the bright colors,"A friend told me what a great mobile this was and how her son enjoyed it for months. I received it as a gift and was very excited when I put it on the crib. The colors are so bright, you can see baby gazing at the colors and animals!After about two weeks, the mobile stopped working. We changed the batteries, the music would play, but no movement! I have been reading other reviews that have mentioned the same problem.It is quite expensive to work for a week then die!"
3,Great mobile but HORRIBLE squeak!,"My son loves the music and the bright creatures; the mobile keeps him stimulated for a good length of time (even at times long enough to get a quick clean of the house in). HOWEVER, about three weeks after using the mobile this HORRIBLE, nagging squeak started. Drive you crazy! I've tried to WD40 it, olive oil it but still the annoying squeak is there. I also wish the volume was a bit lower. I do recommend this mobile as long as you don't mind the squeak and you have a breast pad to put over the speaker at night. It really is a good mobile...the company's quality control just needs to be a LOT better."
2,"My child loved it, while it worked...","My son is only two months old, just when he is starting to get interested in the mobile, it stops working on us. With only about a month's worth of use, the motor went out. The music still plays, but in is motionless. Of course I no longer have a box, much less a receipt. It seems as if mine is not the only one to do this, but maybe just a fluke. Otherwise, it is the best I have seen, just keep your receipt!"
5,Best Toy a baby can have!,"I have the mobile since my son was born and now he is 7.5 months old. He is absolutely addicted to the music and truly thinks those little animals are his best friends. They entertain him, sooth him, and he falls asleep with the mobile on every night. Now that he is older, he is fascinated with the buttons and practicing turning the music on and off by himself. He also tries to prop himself up high enough to grap his friends when they go by. The motor does gets loud after a while, but Tiny Love's customer service is very good and responsive. They sent me a new arm via priority mail after I sent them a request via their website. A great company with inventive toys that capture the imagination of the little ones!!"
1,Couldn't keep one that worked!,"My son loved this mobile. He was completely fascinated by the movements and shapes. I loved it too, until it quit working after 3 weeks. We exchanged it for another one hoping it was a fluke, but the second one quit working after 3 days. We decided to try a different brand. I just now discovered the reviews of how many other people have had the same problem. You would think a GOOD company would address this problem."
3,Love and Hate,"My favorite thing about this mobile is that it plays classical music, and for about 15 minutes at a time! My 1 month old daughter settles right down with the music and seems fascinated by the mobile...until the mobile stopped working! Then I read some of the reviews and saw that others have had the same problem. I thought about calling the company for a replacement motor for the mobile, but then I would still be supporting the company and this product. So, my husband and I decided that we will get a different brand of mobile. I have a music degree and have quite the collection of classical music, so I'm just going to make a CD for my daughter to listen to!"
3,Some definate design problems,I loved this mobile but unfortunately cannot use it on my daughter's crib. We have a sleigh crib so the fastner won't fit over the headboard to attach it at either end (and make it a safe height and out of baby's hands) and we also have a baby bumper which completely covers the controls if it is installed on the side. Not ideal at all. Add to that once attached as it's meant to be (on one side of the crib) the mobile hangs so low that my daughter could easily grab it and pull it down when she is able to do such things. I am sooooo disappointed as it was pretty expensive and got such great reviews otherwise.
2,If it looks too good to be true it probably is!,"We received the mobile as a gift when my daughter was 4 weeks old. At first I was amazed...my daughter was tracking the animals and watching the spinning circles, but after several sets of batteries later and 3 replacements (due to the button sticking, shrieking motor and poorly constucted parts) I would definitly give this one a thumbs down. I realize now that toys not only have to be stimulating to my daughter, but parent friendly as well!"
5,Great Product,"Colorful, entertaining mobile for babies! The music is soothing and the moving animals are a real attraction for my newborn!"
4,good for hard to fit cribs,this was the only mobile that would fit our sleigh bed model crib. our daughter stares at it for good 15 minutes but then she also stares at the trees outside for the same amount of time. we thought since she loves the baby bach dvd she'd like the music on this mobile too. unfortunately not true. maybe because it souns a little tinny. too bad since it play for 15 minutes without any tedious windup mechanism
3,"Looks great, works ok",My 6 month old son loves to look at this mobile. The characters and colors really hold his attention. I think it serves it's purpose well. I have complaints however...sometimes it won't shut off or it won't change the tune. The buttons just won't work! It would also be nice if you could just have the mobile move without the music on.
5,Wonderful,"This is a wonderful mobile. Our baby just loves to lay in her crib and be entertained by the music, sights and sounds. Just 2 observations. Would be better if volume could be controlled rather than just a Hi/Low setting although it's fine for a baby. Second, I think this same mobile may come with a remote control which would be nice. Overall, an excellent value. You cannot go wrong. Other mobiles may ""look"" nicer and match the theme of the nursery, but for quality, get this one and you won't be disappointed. Excellent quality/craftsmanship. We also have the Tiny Love floor gym which our little girl loves as well."
4,mommy saver,"Our son LOVED this mobile. It was the only thing that helped me find the time to take a shower in those early months of parenting. He would gaze at it for 10-15 minutes straight without fussing...just enough time for me to take my daily shower and find my sanity! We received another mobile but it did not keep his interest. The only problem with this mobile is that it broke after 6 months and we couldn't fix it. We are registering for the same one for our 2nd son (due in 10 days!).All in all, a great 'mommy saver' so you can catch a few minutes to yourself!"
1,You end up spending $100 for this by the time the kid is 1,"This thing is cute and expensive and thats all. I hate the mobile 1. It makes a motor noise when its running , you can't hear the music. 2. You spend a $100 in BATTERYS by the time your kid is 1. It takes 4 dd A and I have replaced them 5 times and my daughter is 9 months old. I didn't get this until she was 3 months old now. So 5 months and $30 in batterys.So bacially its turns out the mobile really is $69.99 ! I would buy one that doesn't need battery and much more simple! The music to is good music but sounds like a bad recording."
1,GREAT WHILE IT LASTS!!,motor stopped after a month- exchanged it and the new one did the same thing after 3 weeks.GARBAGE!
1,Save your money!,"This is a good concept, but save your money and try another mobile. We registered for this and got it for a shower gift. Our son was very content to watch and listen, however this is VERY NOISY and after about 3 days of not much use, the mobile part FELL ON HIS HEAD! It just separated from the body of the machine. It was put together correctly and everything. We tried to reassemble it, and within about an hour the same thing happened. Now he can only listen to the music, which is nice, but too bad the whole thing didn't work!!!"
5,Wonderful Mobile!,"Amazingly, this mobile has entranced our baby since we brought him home from the hospital. He loves the classical music, which is much less annoying than most electronic mobiles. And he is fascinated by the motion and colors. It will keep him occupied for pretty good stretches of time, which as another reviewer mentioned, allows you to get a few things done. Plus you don't have to feel guilty for letting it occupy your little one; the sounds and colors help in his development. We love it!"
3,Good but one major problem,This seems like it will be a great mobile but we had a very difficult time getting it attached to our crib. When it finally was attached we tried to adjust it and the small o ring between the two attached sections broke. It broke with very little effort. When we researched reviews on other sites we noticed the same complaint. Once that ring is broken the two pieces do not sit right together and many people complained that the mobile seperated and fell on their babies! Yikes. We're taking back the original product and hope the second won't break so easily. Serious design flaw.
5,The Perfect Mobile!,Our baby was only weeks old and was entranced by this mobile. It keeps her attention and she smiles at the animals. The 15 minute play mode is great. Would highly recommend this product!
3,VERY LOUD AND ANNOYING MOTOR BOX,"The Symphony in Motion Mobile is a great developmental item for my child,BUT the actual gear box which rotates the mobile is very loud and annoying. Either I need to return the item and try another mobile or my child will have to block out the grinding noise and focus on only classical tunes."
2,"Entertaining for baby, but a Huge Hassle for Parents","We love how unique this mobile is and it keeps our 3 month old very entertained most times, but I think it is over priced for the problems that come with it.1- It is unsafe because it tips over at the slightest touch. We don't have a fancy crib, just very simple and oddly enough the mobile does not fit properly over the side. We have to wedge a blanket to keep it from tipping over all the time!2- The motor is very noisy and so I can't use it to put my baby to sleep;it's only used for playtime.3-The On/Off button gets stuck sometimes.4- It consumes far too many batteries, it's already expensive.5- It is an extreme hassle to have to change the batteries by having to take the entire thing off of the crib, then unscrewing the battery compartment and then painfully adjusting it back on the crib all over again.What an expensive crib mobile that only does half of it's job, it should be half the price!"
3,Too Stimulating for a newborn!,When I first saw this mobile I loved it so much and I bought it for my 2 months old(he already has a ordinary one). I couldn't wait to turn it on for my little one. But it seemed like I was more exited by this mobile than my baby. After 5 or 10 minutes he started crying( I suppose it was overstimulating for him).I tried it again some other day but after a while he started crying so loud that I had to hold him and could't calm him for 1 minute. I am so suprised he doesn't like it. I still think it is cute but I will return it.
3,Not bad,"It is a nice product, however it is hard to attach to the crib safely since it seems like any slight touch can get it knocked over, and when you attach it safely, the figures are so high up that my otherwise very curious 1 month old could not see this mobile very well. I ended up returning it :("
3,"Finally a mobile with batteries, BUT.....","I am so glad to have a mobile that I don't have to run and wind after only two minutes of playing. However, the battery operated motor on this thing is as loud as the music! My son doesn't seem to mind, but the whirring sound it makes drives me batty. He does love the colors and shapes, and the little toys that accent the yellow bar at the top actually slid as it spins, so it is a nice toy. But not one to be used when he's trying to go to sleep because it's more noisy than comforting."
1,The Mobiles part falls off,"I bought this mobile for my daughter, and to my suprise today while she was napping the mobile actually fell on tops of her while she was asleep. It was hooked up correctly, as it has never done this in the 4 months we have had it. As a parent, I would consider finding a mobile that is strong,one that doesn't just turn and snap into place, and will not fall on top of an infant. As a result my daughter has a welt on her forehead. As for the music, one would think that they would have put some well known songs from the composers, not some lesser known ones."
2,It's a great mobile...if it doesn't fall apart!,"I have had the same experience as others here. My daughter LOVES this mobile!!! I got two of them....one for the crib at home, and another for the crib at the Montessori she goes to. The one at the Montessori gets used every day. We haven't used the one at home, yet, since she's not sleeping in the crib, yet. Well, the mobile part started falling off while she was using it. ..."
4,Very nice mobile,I really like this mobile. My month old daughter seems to like it as well. She enjoys watching the spinning pieces and I think that the clicking beads are interesting to her. The music is soothing and the volume control is handy.The only complaint I have is that it is a bit stimulating for use as a sleeping aid. I have it mounted on our changing table as I think it's educationally stimulating- but not good for putting her to sleep.
1,Too much stimulation,"I had to return this because it startled my two month old - as the mobile turns, objects slide noisily down the arms and frightened my son. The motor is also noisy compared to a wind up mobile.My son prefers a quiter, soothing mobile but best of all likes looking out the window at the sky and trees, watching leaves blow and listening to the birds and the crickets.Perhaps this mobile works for city babies who are used to startling sounds but this was too loud for my ""country"" lad.The classical music was nice, though."
3,I just can't decide,"I registered for and received this as a shower gift. It was the first thing that I set up when I got home.I thought it looked entrancing and that the music was much much clearer and less pingy than any other mobile out there BUT It didn't matter because you could barely hear it over the terrible squealling of the motor. Before my son was born I tried to exchange it for another of the same thinking that there was something wrong with mine. We brought some batteries and a small screw driver(batteries are very annoying to change) to the store with us.Well, they all squeal so I just returned it. My 8 week old son loves to watch things moving above him and he loves music but I just can't decide whether or not to go back and repurchase this item."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this mobile after researching several. I decided to spend the extra money because the reviews for this were very high. I was extremely disappointed with this product, and returned it. If you have a crib with bumpers, this product does not attach well at all because it has to be behind the bumpers or mushes them down. It also falls over very easily by touch, and I did not feel it was safe for my son who moves around a lot in his crib. Finally, the motor is so loud it woke my son up as opposed to helping him fall asleep. The only positive aspect was the music, which was classical and had three selections. This is hard to find in other products. All in all, though, I suggest chosing something else."
5,Well worth every penny!,"My husband and I chose this mobile because it has bright colors combined with black and white, which are stimulating colors to babies. The fact that it plays classical music is a bonus.We love the fact that you can choose between three different classical selections. The mobile is also tilted at an angle, which makes it easier for the baby to see the figures. I also believe that it helps the baby learn to watch things as they go in an arc - an integral part of baby development.Since our little one is still in a bassinet due to the fact that she is only two months old, we use ours on the changing table. No matter how fussy she is when we put her on the table, she quiets as soon as we turn on this mobile. You can't beat that!"
5,Still Wonderful,"We purchased this mobile for our son when he was a newborn. He was enthralled with the music, colors, and animals at this early age. At the appropriate age, we removed the animals portion of the mobile and left the ""music box"" intact. Our son is now 2 1/4 years old and he cannot go to bed without having the music on. The ""music box"" even travels with us when we will be staying over-night at another location; it is such an integral part of our sons sleep experience. He loves it so much, he turns it on whenever he wants."
4,Best Toy Ever....,"I must say I like frogs and my 1 month year old does too. This has to be the only time he can stay up in his crib and just stare at the swinging frogs and birds. The music is also a plus, it even puts me to sleep :-). Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the little things that slid off it when it spins are annoying. I just figured out how to stop them with out blocking them with tape :-)."
3,Great while it lasted,"My son loved this mobile, then the motor burned out after only 2 weeks. It was used often, but we decided not to get another. We just put the ugly, basic, wind-up one back up and got the Baby Einstein Vivaldi and Beethoven Cd's to fill the room with classical music."
2,Broken in less than two months!,"We thought this mobile was very cute when we got it, but after only 7 weeks of very limited use, the mobile stopped moving. The music still worked, but with the mobile broken, its pretty useless. I don't think it was worth the money we spent on it, since there is no way for us to fix the mobile or get a refund from Amazon. Beware of the quality of this product!"
2,What a Shame,"My daughter loves this mobile. It is fun, colorful and very entertaining....when it works. We were very excited to get this as a gift since it costs about $40.00. It worked for a day or two and then stopped moving so we unplugged the animated part and plugged it back into the base several times and it worked again for a few days and then quit moving altogether. The music works fine and she still loves to look at the toys on the mobile but we must get it replaced."
2,disappointment,"This mobile is heavy, awkward and the remote control was missing from the box the mobile came in. I'm not happy with it. Would not recommend."
2,"Great idea, Bad design","My husband and I loved this for our first son, however after two months the mobile slowed down and the music would not play. I returned it for another one and three weeks later the same thing happened with the new one. The mobile itself is a great idea but they still have many kinks to work out with it."
5,God Send!,"I bought this for my 19 month old daughter, when she was a baby. She loved it, the music is soothing and the animals entertaining. It has 15 minutes worth of music before it shuts off and this gave her time to go to sleep. When she was sitting up, I detached the animals and just used the music box.She still has this in her cot and when she awakes at any time, she just turns it on and nods back off again.I have never had any problems with this product and would recommend to anybody. I will be buying a newer version for my baby due in June 2004, as my daugher will not have any other mobile in her cot!"
5,Best purchase,"I got this mobile when my son was born and put it on his crib immediately. From day one that he was in his crib, the music played as he fell asleep. As he got older, I think he associated the music from the mobile with sleeping and it put him right out. If he woke in the middle of the night or too early in the morning to get up, I would just hit the music to start it again, and he would instantly go back to sleep.We have since removed the mobile portion since he is older now (17 months) however the music part stays on his crib and plays every night as he goes to bed. Its cute to watch and listen as he has learned to turn it on and off. I also bring it with me wherever I go, to ensure my son a good night sleep.Great purchase, and highly recommended!"
2,stops working,"Hi,I had seen some reviews before I bought it, that it would stop working after a few weeks. I figured it was a fluke and a few were bad. Boy was I sorry I bought it.My daughter just loved the mobile but after about 3 weeks it stopped working. And it didn't get excessive use. It's such a cute product, and babies love the colors and music but the quality of the motor is not reliable at all.I didnt even bother getting another one since I figured the same thing would happen again."
5,LIFE SAVER MOBILE,THIS MOBILE HAS BEEN A LIFE SAVER MY DAUGHTER STAYS AMUSED FOR 1/2HOUR LOVES THE BRIGHT COLORS AND THAT THE ANIMALS TURN TO LOOK AT HER. SHE FOLLOWS THEM AROUND.... WELL WORTH IT!!
1,Broke after two weeks.,"Our baby loved this mobile, but it broke after just two weeks of very light use."
2,"Nice, if it would work properly","I have had 3 of these mobiles. With each one, the mobile head stopped turning after about 2 weeks to a month. I went through a slew of batteries before I figured out that it was the product itself. The first one I returned the store for a replacement. After the second one did the same thing, I bought an entirely new one. After the third one did the same thing, I called customer service. They said they would send out a replacement head, but they never did. Now I am on my second child, I received it for a gift again, and the SAME THING has happened. I am still waiting for my mobile head replacement (this tmim I called Tiny Love customer service right after it stopped working). I love the music, but I just wish it would work!!!"
2,Good concept but electrical problems,"I liked this mobile when it worked, but unfortunately that was only about 10 percent of the time we had it. From the first unwrapping, I couldn't get the music and the mobile arms to both work at the same time. If I unscewed things I could get one or the other to go a time, but there was obviously some electrical problem that never worked itself out. I've heard similar things from some friends who had this, so I wouldn't recommend buying this mobile until the company works these issues out!"
5,The best baby product we have!,"We had heard reviews about this product but were a bit hesitant due to the cost. But, we ended up receiving it as a gift and fell in love with it. Our three week old daughter was instantly soothed by the music (a bit tinny but not bad for electrical music) and the shapes. She can sit and stare at the motions for at least the entire 15 minutes of play time and it is great to play during diaper changes where it is helpful to have her calm. We would say that it is worth the money and is a great developmental toy that can save parents some sanity during the day."
4,One word of Caution . . .,"The mobile is very secure from a front to back standpoint, but it has slipped sideways (rotated?) on us which does not entirely put it in the crib, but some of the strings with the toys land in the crib so we only use it when we are awake. That is fine as it stimulates my son, it does not put him to sleep. I think the noise as it slides is on purpose. The bright color and music are great. Also, the music box part is detachable and we can bring it with us. Great mobile for the daytime, but not at night due to the safety issue."
4,Love This Mobile,"My baby just loves this mobile. She stares at it and talks to it the whole time she's in her crib, it doesn't matter if it's on or off. She just loves it. I like the music it plays and I LOVE that it stays on for 15 minutes at a time. It's so colorful and a great design. I know a lot of people complain about the sliding pieces making to much noise, my baby actually likes the noise that it makes, Go Figure! The only reason I didn't give this mobile 5 stars is because the on/off and music buttons are hard to push. Also I wish it would have come with a remote instead of having to go to the crib to turn it back on everytime. Other than that this is a GREAT MOBILE!!!"
4,My preemie loved it.,I've read a number of reviews on this product and obviously this is not for everyone. I had the opportunity to try this when my son was in the neonatal intensive care unit. He loved it so much that I plan on buying one for his nursery at home. The clacking noise is a little annoying and the music isn't as clear as I would like but I'm not buying it for me. My son is the one who liked it. We have the Baby Bugs mobile on his crib right now and he loves it but the music plays for only a couple of minutes (and it plays the same tune over and over) while this mobile plays for 15 minutes. One night in the NICU he fell asleep watching the animals. I have a rather demanding baby and this calmed him down. I'm sold.
1,Don't buy this:,"I love the design of this mobile, my baby does too; the problem is that the mobile breaks within a week of use. I ordered 3 of these and had to return each one because they malfunctioned. Save yourself the time and choose another mobile. I do have the Geometric Shapes mobile from Tiny Love which has worked for months, however, I did not have this mobile shipped to me, I purchased it in a store. I do not know if the product becomes damaged while being shipped or if this particular design is defective, but I would strongly recommend choosing another mobile."
2,Just okay,"The quality of this product is great, and it has performed well, no problems. I am basing my review on my baby's reaction to the mobile and my annoyance at the hype that surrounds it. It seems that the last thing that my baby wants when she is trying to fall asleep is a musical freak show tumbling at her. She doesn't like it for awake entertainment either, I guess for the same reason. The music that accompanies it is clunky like a cheap toy piano, which kind of defeats the purpose of it being classical music. No, you can't mute the music. The beads sliding around while it operates are noisy, but maybe babies like the ""white noise"".The product claims to enrich your baby's mind to the point of genius, which you learn by reading the small novel enclosed with the product, informing you that the Beetoven is for ""stimulation"", the Bach for ""relaxing"", and the Mozart for ""cognitive development"". I was embarrassed that I had fallen for the hype and bought this mobile."
5,The best mobile in the entire world!!!!!!!!!!!,"I had the John Lennon musical parade mobile (cute, but boring). You have to wind it every minute & my son (1 1/2 mos. at the time, and fussy) was not really interested in it. My sister-in-law's baby C.J. had this and she loved it so I gave it a try. He can't get enough of it. It plays great music, no winding, the bright colors, shapes and movement keep him occupied for ages (even puts him to sleep). Kevin is 3 mos. old and is right now in his crib giggling and smiling at it. This mobile is a must have. It is worth any amount of money!"
1,Good principle but doesnt work!,I think this is a fantastic mobile with great music and 3 d motion. However mine stopped rotating after roughly 3 weeks and Tiny Love will not answer my queries. What use is an expensive mobile that doesnt aimate my baby??
2,Very low,"I do not yet have my baby, but of course we are getting the nursery ready. The minute I saw this mobile I loved it. I bought it immediately. But when I attached it to our crib the animals were almost touching the mattress. A baby is not supposed to be able to reach the mobile, and so I am not taking any chances. I have read the other reviews and not too many people have had this problem, I don't understand how other babies have not been able to reach the mobile. Anyway I have returned it."
2,Not very soothing to a parent,"I am really glad I tried this Mobile out before the baby came. My husband and I thought that it was almost instantly annoying. I way prefer the old hand-wind version my 3 yr old had. The sliding shapes that move constantly as the mobile turns give off a clacking plastic noise. We have the crib in our bedroom and that would drive us nuts instantly. Maybe baby's like it, but ours will like another once I return this one just as well too.And the music has a very canned midi sound to it. I'd much prefer the old chimes of a one song mobile."
1,Unfortunately I brought it back,I've received this mobile for baby shower.Unfortunately I brought it back because it didn't work.:-(
1,SOOOOO DISAPOINTED,"I loved this mobile when I saw it but that is about all it has going for it, it's cute.First, it doesnt stay up straight on our crib because it is so top heavy (very dangerous). With the slightest movement it tips over.The motor is loudMusic is not crisp or clearThe fastener that is supposed to keep the mobile in place is bulky and made of cheap plastic.I have to return this over priced mobile for one that will actualy do what it is supposed to do. So if you are like me and loved it because it is cute...beaware and hang onto your reciept."
1,Bad Purchase,"When I had purchased the Symphony Animal Mobile,I was excited and so was my son at 6mo old. After a couple of days my son was in his crib playing and I hurd a noice and animal mobile had fallen on to my son and from that point on it kept falling everytime my son would play with it."
2,"Es bonito, pero no me convence...","Originalmente compré un ""mobile"" de cuerda para mi bebé que estaba por nacer, pero más tarde en comprarlo que en arruinarse, son sumamente delicados y frágiles. Por lo anterior decidí comprar este producto, por ser más resistente y por usar baterías, lo que hace que tenga una duración de hasta 45 minutos la música y movimientos para nuestra bebé. Sin embargo, no me convenció desde el principio, las figuras son un poco grandes y grotescas, la música realmente no me gusta, le falta más vivacidad y las tres tonadas suenan muy parecidas, y hace mucho ruido al funcionar. No me arrepiento de haberlo comprado, pero verdaderamente considero que hay mejores productos a precios más accesibles."
2,Parents Nightmare,"In the beginning it was great, our child loved it! Until it started making an aweful squeeking noise. We returned it and got another thinking it was just faulty. Wrong, they are all like that after about a week. Now, the gears get stuck and it won't move. I think it was a great idea for babies, but for the price of it, you would think it would last more than a couple of months."
5,Best Shower Gift,This is one of my favorite shower gifts. I had it on my registry because I thought it was neat. My daughter absolutly finds it amazing. She is 10 weeks old and will lay watch it intently. I have a friend that also has this mobile and is concerned with taking it away from her daughter. She loves it so much that she will turn it on by herself at 5 months. I highly recommend this product to anyone having a baby!
3,Very Cute But Could've Been Better !!,"My son's had this toy since he was about 1 month and a half.But before I got the right one, I had returned about 4 of them ( literally) and now I've finally got a good one and my son loves it, he can be in the crib for about 30 good minutes just talking and staring at it.. But don't get your hopes up just yet because it still has one problem that drives me crazy, I have to change the batteries every week or two, and sometimes the little animals hanging don't rotate completly, and the little rings above make an annoying noise when its rotating.What made me buy it was that it was unique and very colorful and most important he loved the first one and now the fourth one !!!"
4,"Baby loves this, but...","My baby loves this mobile. I received it as a shower gift (no receipt), used it a total of 8 days and it died. I called Tiny Love and they sent me a replacement no questions asked so I give their customer service 5 stars. I've also found that the long green arm thing turns very easily in the base. Not a huge issue, I would just prefer it be more stable."
2,GREAT ENTERTAINER IF IT WORKS,"This was one of the best things that we could buy for our child. It keeps him amused when he is in his crib and he gets so excited when I tell him that he is going to see his animals. The really bad part of this product is that I have had to return it 3 times and today will be my 4th b/c the mobile stops rotating. This is really aggravating, but the product is great when it does work."
2,I did not like it,The music quality was bad and it made other distracting noises as it moved. Baby could care less about it.
3,Symphony NOT in Motion...wish it had lasted,"I must first say I gave this mobile 3 stars because my son LOVED it. Unfortunately just about the time he started to coo and babble (6 weeks old) so we knew he loved it, the motor quit. The music still played, but the mobile would not budge. I returned it for a new one, but that one was broken when I got it home, so I started to do some more research and found that the motor quitting is really common with this one. It's a shame, because it's a great mobile developmentally for the baby, and like I said, my son loved it. If you don't mind exchanging it for a new one every few weeks or months, then by all means, buy this mobile. It just did not seem to be worth the aggravation for our family, so we bought the Fisher Price Ocean Wonders mobile. It sounds nicer and has many more features for less money. I don't think it would be as good for a newborn, but now that my son is almost 2 months old and can see better, I think it will suit him very well."
2,Wanted to love it,"Initially I fell in love with this mobile because of the classical music for developing minds and cute contrasting characters for young eyes. But then we put batteries in it.The motor was as loud as the repetitive tinny music. And, when the little sliding pieces on the mobile arms move they make a clapping noise. Overall it is very noisy, distracting, and drove me crazy. How could a baby be calmed by this mobile? So we returned it and went with the Deluxe Developmental Mobile by Sassy.The Sassy Mobile is quiet, has more music options (classical, lullaby, ocean waves), a remote control, twelve (four reversable and four soft animals) contrasting interchangeable objects for different stages of vision development and, costs less.The Symphony Animal Mobile by Tiny Love is an example of ""you don't always get what you pay for."""
1,LOOK OUT BELOW!,"WHEN I REGISTERED FOR THIS MOBILE I IGNORED THE REVIEWS THAT SAID IT FALLS APART BECAUSE I REALLY WANTED IT FOR MY BABY. IT IS A GREAT CONCEPT BUT IT DID FALL ON MY BABY'S HEAD, IT ACTUALLY DOES NOT STAY ATTACHED TO THE ARM. WE HAVE TRIED NUMEROUS TIMES TO MAKE IT WORK BUT, IT KEEPS FALLING APART. DEFINATELY PLAN ON EXCHANGING IT."
3,Honestly,"The Baby Enthusiast should not speak so negatively of the Texan. I too bought this mobile. I was very excited to get it installed. The mobile would turn but no music would play unless you smacked it first (several times). I had to dismantle it and return it. I have not had any problems with the tripod arm falling off. However, the attachement unit could have a better design. The volume control has only 2 selections. It would be nice to have a little more control of the volume. The mobile is very entertaining and the music selection is appropriate."
5,So great!,"I got this for Bella when she was 3 months old, because her first mobile had to be wound up and it only played music for maybe 2 minutes. This mobil was a blessing, it allowed me to take a shower without her screaming. The music lasts for 15 minutes or so. Now that she is 11 months old we only have the music box in the crib, I put it on for her during naps and bedtime. I think it really helps her bedtime routine to allow for more peaceful relaxation and sleep."
1,Works great - THEN BREAKS!,"This is a wonderful mobile when it is working...However, when the motor burns out after 1 months use, which I gather from calls to Tiny Love happens more than they would like to admit, the customer service and replacement has been worthless.I might as well have gone out and bought a brand new mobile (from a different company) rather than deal with Tiny Love.I have replaced the mobile with the FISHER-PRICE Aquarium, which my little man loves.So, for all you new moms and dads out there looking for the perfect item to get your little one to rest, and give yourself some in the process, I'd skip right past the Tiny Love mobile and move onto the Aquarium. Save yourself the $40 and the aggravation."
1,Wish it would move,"I was very excited about this mobile after reading thegreat reviews here. When we set it up, though, it wouldnot move and I had to return it. The music sounds tinnyto the extent that I could not recognize the pieces,although I am familiar with most of Beethoven and Mozart'scompositions. Cute concept,, but poor execution. And why doall mobiles fit only cribs, why not have a mount that can befixed elsewhere: a wall or a ceiling."
2,Not for Everyone,"I put this mobile on my registry and received it as a gift at my shower. I tried and tried to get it to stay on the crib, but had no luck. I am disappointed that I had to return this mobile. It is a shame that they don't make them to fit a variety of crib shapes."
4,Baby loved it. Poor quality,"I fell in love with this mobile when I first saw it on a magazine, and we bought it when our baby was 2 months. The baby loved it, she smiled, waved and showed excited when she had this mobile moving above her. But after 1 or 2 months, this mobile stopped working. I had to return it to the store. The new one worked but it made a weird noise. Anyway my baby is almost seven months, she still has the mobile in her crib and enjoy seeing and listening to it. Of course I had to place it in a higher place because she tries to catch the little animals."
1,It scratched my crib!!!,"Yes, along with most of you I thought this was a very cute mobile. But, the first time I changed the batteries I noticed that my crib was completely scratched. I called Tiny Love and was told that that only happens if it does not fit your crib, however the only way to know if it fits your crib is by putting it on. The cs rep was going to talk to the owner of the company and get back to me. Well, that was about a month ago and I have yet to hear anything."
4,Just a super mom of 4 children,"At first, I didn't like the sound of the mobile, because it just wasn't the typical soft sound you would expect from a baby mobile. But my baby which is 11 months now, sure loves it! He loves it so much, he can't sleep without it. It's just so soothing and relaxing for him. And it plays for a long time (20 minutes long). One thing I would strongly suggest is to keep extra batteries around. Although the (3) AAA batteries goes a long way (about 3 months, using it 4-5 times daily), you sure don't want it to die on you when your baby is depending on it. The only thing I didn't like about it, is after using it excessively, the mobile started to squeak which could be annoying if you're trying to sleep. So I had to disconnect the hook w/the animals from the base, so only the music was heard."
5,Love the Tiny Love Mobile!,"I have visisted the Babies R Us web site several times and read the reviews for all items my husband and I had wanted to purchase. Our nursery is Winnine the Pooh themed, thus we wanted to add a Pooh mobile. However, the reviews were just terrible. I read several other reviews of other mobiles, and the same result. Therefore, I went to Babies R Us with an open mind, read the offerings on each mobile, and decided on the Tiny Love Symphony Animal Mobile. We purchased this particular item for the long music playtime of 15 minutes, the colorful and cute animals, and the contrasting colors that babies see at birth. We have had absolutely no problem with this beautiful mobile. It is AWESOME!! Take time and do your own research to see what fits your lifestyle, wants, and needs."
5,LOVE THIS MOBILE!,My baby fell in love with this mobile from the start. She loves to stare at all the movement and the music is very soothing. I would strongly recommend this mobile to any parent.
4,"Baby love s this mobile, but need to fix the buttons!","My 9 month old daughter still absolutely LOVES this mobile (I know you're supposed to take it down at 5 months). We lowered her crib mattress so the baby can't reach it. When she begins to pull up,it will definitely have to come down. If you don't secure it well to the side it does topple over which could be dangerous. The only reason I had to give it 4 stars was because it stopped working (not the batteries)! The buttons have gotten stuck and it won't turn on despite me pushing the buttons a million times. My friend had the same problem with hers and she only used it for 5 months. I still have it in her crib, and she stares at it waiting for it to move. I'd definitely buy another mobile for my next baby if I knew this problem were fixed."
5,A Definite Must-Have,As a first time mom I didn't know much about baby toys and picked this out b/c of a lot of good reviews. I like it so much that I had to write in and add my own. My daughter absolutely loves it! It keeps her occupied longer than anything else. The little animals are precious and it's nice to hear classical music (rather than Mary had a Little Lamb a million times :)
2,I'd love the mobile if it worked better!!!,"We bought this mobile when our son was about a month old and he absolutely loved it. The animals are very cute and the music is pleasant. It kept him entertained for hours. But after about 7 weeks, the mobile part quit spinning. The music still worked. We took it back and got another just like it. After putting it together, it didn't work at all. As much as my son loved it, I think it is time to move on to another name brand of mobiles!"
2,Not worth buying!,"My son loves this mobile but it is the 2nd one we got the first stoped working after two months, so i went and got another one that one only lasted 2 weeks. i tried changing the batteries and finally i gave up i bought diferent mobile. I hung the little animals on my sons new mobile (Not a tiny love mobile) and he loves it! It is sad that tiny love would make a product that does not last. If it did last i would recommend it to everyone! :("
2,Hangs too low,"We received this mobile, which we registered for, as a shower gift. We put it together right away, but when we tried to put it on the crib we found that the angle of the rotating motor makes the bottom animal rotate way too close to the crib mattress. The baby isn't even here yet, and I could tell that if we left it up the animals would actually brush across his face...annoying, not to mention the danger of the small parts being that easily reached by the baby. It is a really cute mobile, and the box did say fits MOST cribs, so maybe ours was a fluke, but I would suggest trying to find one on display in the store and thinking about how it will fot your crib before registering or purchasing one."
3,Product needs work!,"I really enjoy this mobile and so does my son-when it works. He is only 3 months old and I have had to replace the motor twice already!! I have written to the company but have yet to receive my ""prompt response"". I give this mobile one more chance-if I have to replace the motor again it is going back!!"
5,fun fun fun,"To me this is certainly one of the third wave ska classics. Funny, irreverant, clean and phat.""Super Nice Guys"", the song, is reason enough to buy this album."
2,Black ink nozzle is always clogged,"Like a number of other reviewers I have experienced the same problem; I have to perform a deep nozzle clean for the black ink before EVERY print job. Once this is done, the output is exceptional, especially photos, but this cleaning wastes time, ink and paper. From the number of other reviewers who have experienced the exact same problem it is clearly not a fault with my particular unit, but a fundamental design flaw of this model. Be very wary."
2,A step backwards for CANON.,"I recetly bought a new Canon i550 printer and I put it to work immediately. First, I was impressed by its quietness and the capability of closing both trays, input & output. But I'm using my printers only for making brochures and booklets for my patients in 3 different languages, not for photographs or pictures...For my purpose, this printer is very disapointing product: the print is faint (not CRISPY, as most other reviewers stated), even in its highest quality--it can't much even the ""draft"" mode of Canon S600 inkjet printer, which i'm using successfully for better than 8 months. I thought Canon is improving their line of products progressively (they stopped manufacturing the EXCELLENT S600), but it seems I'm wrong! Of course, I'm still going to look at Canon printers because of their economical ""Think Tank"", but I'll first try them and than buy."
1,First 12 months was fine....,"Have had this printer about 15 months. It worked fine for the first twelve months, now out of warranty and, depite many, many attempts at changing cartridges, cleaning and re-aligning print heads, I can only get magenta to print out stripey. Driving me nuts! Spent 20 on new cartridges three days ago (because I hadn't used the printer for a while) and still no luck.Can't get to UK Tech Support page, so no help there.Shall I get it repaired or ditch it for something better?"
2,Unusable for flesh tones,"Prints landscapes nicely...flesh tones are horrible!!! Unusable! Anyone want to buy mine? I've manually changed the print settings, cleaned the heads, nothing helps. My old $50 Epson makes better prints. No one else here seems to have this problem...maybe I got a lemon. Stay away from this one!"
5,Finally! A working printer!,"After owning 6 different printers in as many years, I was totally depressed to think about buying another. With 200+ printers to choose from under $200, I researched for a week and finally took the plunge! All I can say is, ""WoW!"". The installation was flawless, the bundled software is capable and fast. Formatting and printing is a breeze. The printer is so quiet, even in standard mode, that nobody knew I had it up and running before the photo came out in 1:05 minutes. For those folks who are totally overwhelmed by the choices out there, LOOK NO FARTHER! I'd rate this 6 stars if they'd let me.... As a foot note, I have a rather dusty environment and the Canon i550 has feed and paper path doors which can be closed when not in use, eliminating the need for a dust cover."
5,Best Printer for the Price!,"Two words: Buy it! This printer is one of the best in its class. It gives great print quality, text and photos, and is faster than most in its price range. I also love the design of this machine. The paper tray and holder both fold neatly inside the printer to conserve desk space and make it easy to transport. As in most Canon printers, the ink tanks are separate which makes changing colors easy, convenient, and affordable. It's also very simple to use. Within ten minutes you'll be printing your favorite pictures with surprising results.There's not much else to say about this printer. I highly recommend it for home use and casual photography."
2,Great Printer Except for Big Print Head Clogging Problem,"The black print head constantly clogs. If I haven't printed in a day or two I must clean the head or my printout will soon run out of black ink. I'm not sure how much ink is wasted in this cleaning process, but clearly this is not a defect I expected from a Canon printer. I bought the i550 because I like Canon ink cartridge prices - a major cost often overlooked by buyers. Other than this major exception, the print quality is great and the price was good. Would I buy another Canon printer? Absolutely! Following the cleaning the print quality is very good."
1,Produst not same as shown.,"Product is not the same bottle or color as the Max Factor Whipped Cream Cool Beige 309 as shown. The make up color label is clearly an add on sticker and the rest of the labeling is not the same as shown in ad. It makes you beleive your getting the true formula ,I suppose. The makeup is much lighter than the Max Factor Whipped Cream Cool Beige 309 in the older bottles , like the one that is presented in the ad. The makeup seems more "" runny or watery"" than any of this product I have used in the past."
4,"Quite the singer, composer ad apparently an actor too","I bought this CD for the proper french version of ""a little love and understanding"" as I thought our band might throw it in as a little novelty whereby we would alternate between english and french and may still do this.But this 2 cd pack was recorded at the re-opening of the Olympia where he first debuted in 1954 so in 1997 you get 21 songs in french and in that talking/singing french style.Apparently Edith Piaf encouraged him to sing.So these were all french favourites but a very talented person to have composed ""let it be me,"" ""what now my love"" and co-write with Neil Diamond.Not a must have cd and not a cd for a french friend,(probably has it) but a CD that gives you some insight into this remarkable man and his music."
4,revealing expose,This book made me to learn more about the origin of the so called Askenazi Jews who are actually Europeans and have now constituted as ninety percent of jews now.I would recommend this book for people to know that the Askenazi Jews are not the same as the Shepherdic Jews
2,Good for the beginning genealogist,"In fact, I believe this book is mistitled. It should be ""The Beginning Genealogist."" I consider myself an ""intermediate"" genealogist and looked forward to many timesaving tips. Most of the timesavers I had already figured out for myself. The forms are helpful if you don't have them, but don't try to find them in the index. I tried to find the Correspondence Log. The only index reference is to a page that gives you a cross-reference to the introduction to the log. This section leads you to the form in the index. This was not worth the time and money to me."
4,Color Coding the Binders,"I wish I could figure out what the author is describing I like the idea of the alpha card index to the pedigree chart and identifying each surname with a colored dot that corresponds to a binder on which a similar larger dot is placed on its spine. This affords ability to transfer family group sheets from one binder into another that would be taken to a research facility and then easily return them to the correct binder. However, she says she has over 20 binders and the colored dots come in four primary colors....does this mean she has many red dot binders for say alpha letters A-D, E-G, etc. There is no way to submit a comment or question. I am trying to use many of these features but instructions not clear."
2,outdated,"Until this is updated, I would have to say don't bother. She is fantastically organized, and has great tips, but a normal person really isn't going to go to this much trouble. And there is not enough info about organizing using a computer."
4,Hilarious Romantic Comedy,I found this movie hilarious and quite enjoyable. The music is great and any Janeane Garofalo fans will be pleased. Sure you have to suspend some belief sometimes and the main plot setup is a bit far-fetched but for me the laugh out loud moments far outweighed any other considerations. Give this one a try.
3,OK for a Sunday Afternoon,"No, this movie won't win any awards, but for a Sunday afternoon it wasn't a bad watch. I actually enjoyed the movie. Janeane was her usual angst ridden self. Tamala Jones was hilarious (""booty doo"" cracked me up). I actually came to see if it was on DVD, and to my delight it is!"
1,Not the Janeane I was hoping for.,"I was disappointed in this movie. The delightfully sarcastic and grumpy Janeane Garofalo that I expected would entertain me was replaced by a weak and nervous character that made predictably embarrassing choices. It did not live up to ""The Match Maker,"" which I thoroughly enjoyed."
1,A wretched piece of work....Janeane (and her fans) deserve better...,"This is a really bad, made for TV movie for the Oxygen network. Made for TV movies are generally below par, but this one is 400 notches below that. I couldn't even make it through the whole thing. It's extremely depressing to watch, because it's so badly written and directed. Seeing Janeane Garofalo in this tripe makes it especially painful as well. Knowing how articulate and intelligent she can be, it hurts to see her in this ""film"". Maybe she had bills to pay. She deserve better material, a lot better. She has a cult fan base, and perhaps they're willing to see her in any type of setting. I'm not, but I would love to see her in something brilliant. Despite all this, Janeane is still worth watching, no matter what she does. Me watching this garbage shows how much I like her as an actress.The fact that this is out on DVD proves that they will put just about anything on DVD."
5,Amazing,What a great follow up to The Spirit Room! Michelle has really topped an album that I thought she could never outdo. This album just flows so nicely from one song to the next. The lyrics are so heartfelt and intelligently written.
1,every song sounds the same;,"i've been following michelle branch since her ""broken bracelet"" days and am left feeling disenchanted upon hearing her newest album. a concerted effort, but ultimately i feel it falls flat. just goes to show that even with having all the money, the hottest proucers and best musicians to make an album, it doesn't guarantee it will be a good album. every song is about lost love (is there nothing else to write about?) and how hard fame has been. if you want an album with those same topics, but written and executed more creatively check out the counting crows' sophomore effort ""recovering the satellites"".i wouldn't recommend this album. every song sounds the same, and in the process none end up being memorable."
5,Hooray for Michelle!,"As I type this review, the awesome rock lyrics to ""Are You Happy Now?"" are playing in my head, and my mind is set on telling you how truly talented, and worthy of your hearing Michelle Branch really is. Not only does she write her own songs, and play them on her guitar, but her songs are actually good, and, unsurprisingly, hits. ""Breathe"" and ""Are You Happy Now?"" are my favorite songs on this album.Michelle's songs consist of rock songs, slower songs, pop songs, and rock/pop songs. She is definately up there with Avril Lavigne, so if you like Avril, I'd highly recommend Michelle Branch to you.The Spirit Room, Michelle's first album, is awesome, too, and I would recommend it as much, if not more then, Hotel Paper.This review was brought to you by,GMM (...)"
3,Over-rated,"First off, for the love of god, Michelle Branch ISN'T that good of a guitarist. Yes, she can write hooks, she can write catchy songs, and she can also write deep, meaningful songs. But being a good songwriter and being a good guitarist are two different things. Michelle Branch is an average guitarist, an above-average vocalist and a slightly above average song-writer. Personally, I thought this album was subpar compared to The Spirit Room. This album strives to be ""mature"" in a way, while the Spirit Room was just a fun, catchy, straight-forward album."
2,"Weak, uninspiring , ballads make this a disspointment","I loved Michelle's first CD, The Spirit Room. After dissing all the crappy young girl artists like Brit and Christina, Michelle's sound was different and refreshing. Her guitar riffs and fantastic melodies made me an instant fan.Maybe my expectations were too high for this cd and that's why i was dissapointed. This album consisted of toned down lighter ballads and made this cd very weak. She tries too hard to sing over her songs. This made her voice sound much worse than it really is. Less voice and more riffs would've helped. Plus, the songs sound too much the same.I really wanted to like this cd but i couldn't. This album wasn't even close to the Spirit Room."
5,Glorious Voice of Miss Michelle Branch,"Hotel Paper songs are truly beautiful, packed with heart and soul by Michelle. I especially like ""Till I Get Over You."" A song so beautifully written, so emotionally performed, it has no words to describe its greatness."
5,You can't leave this cd!,"I think its a really cd of the best pop-rock. Her songs of this cd like Til I Get Over You that you can listen words when you listen the song in the backward, or Desperately or Tuesday Morning are always songs that she felt in her skin, not a invented history.If you like Avril Lavigne, Alanis Morrissette, Sheryl Crow or Vanessa Carlton you have to get this cd it's so sweet, and it have a very emotionals songs like It's you, or Tuesday morning"
4,Not Bad,"For a Sophomore release, i would say that this album is simply not bad. I am eternally impressed by Branch's talent both in singing and in songwriting, but compared to The Spirit Room, Hotel Paper does not stand out (as much) in my mind. I won't go through song by song, because it is a given that each and every song is beautifully and performed, and most certainly has a refreshing message to send. While some of the ideas are cliche, i completely respect Branch's ability to adapt her sense of self to a life on the road while maintaining her unique style.If you liked the first album, you will like the second. Michelle Branch is still one of the most talented young artists out there today."
1,"Get a shredder for this ""hotel paper""","What happened to Michelle Branch? Her debut THE SPIRIT ROOM was absolutely awesome. It was a 5 star CD and I really liked it a lot. So, naturally I couldn't wait for this CD. After listening to HOTEL PAPER I felt like throwing my stereo out the window. It is soooooo depressing. Michelle lost all of her spunk, wit, and songwriting/musical ability on this ... CD. The only 2 worthy tracks are ""breathe"" and ""are you happy now?"" HOTEL PAPER is a big disappointment. It's loaded with dreary ballads with sulking lyrics. It's obvious that she's not happy now! If you liked THE SPIRIT ROOM, avoid this at all costs! Hopefully Michelle will find herself for future releases. HOTEL PAPER is not her."
4,LOVE THIS CD,I put off buying Hotel Paper for a long time I loved Are you Happy Now? and would sing along on the radio but it's always been my experaince the the follow up is never good as the orginal. For me Spirit Room was like Michelle Branch came over to my house and cracked open my head saw all that I felt and had been through and went I will write you some songs and I knew nothing could follow up to that. Expect Hotel Paper has. It's like michelle Branch came over to my house again cracked open my head and went i see what you're feeling and I will write you another set of songs becuase you need it.And I think that's what makes a great cd when you can sit down and relate to it and it touches and affects your life. If you're looking for a poppy cd this isn't the one for you and I'm personal glad that it isn't that.
5,"In Many Ways, Better Than Her First Album","This album grows on me with every listen -- I've come to appreciate Michelle Branch The Artist who is earnest and just plain loves to play her music.Usually when I play this CD I go straight to track 7, ""Love Me Like That"" and play the LoveMe-Desperately-Breathe-WhereAreYOu-HotelPaper quint. These songs indicate to me that Michelle has plenty of room to grow as an artist, has mentors like Sheryl Crow, and therefore is likely to find her best work ahead of her rather than behind her.This album will find its way into my rotation for many years to come..."
4,Michelle has grown up,"Every song on this record is so great, both musically and lyrically. I only have two problems with it, the first track, there is no need for it, and her duet with Sheryl Crow. The duet is great I just wish we could hear Sheryl when they are singing on the chourse."
4,Nice follow up.,"It's nice to see that Michelle didn't fall into the sophomore slump with this. I loved Are You Happy Now when I first heard it, so that prompted me to check out this CD. In addition to The Spirit Room, if you are a true Branch fan, this CD with also hold a place in your heart."
3,Branch should touch up on her song writing,"I'm sorry but this is a [bad] cd. I was thoroughly delighted with her first cd 'the spirit room', so when I heard she was coming out with a new cd and first heard one of the only good songs in'hotelpaper'- ""are you happy now?"", I went out and bought it. Well I listened and found that the only halfway decent songs were the ones cowritten by Branch. On one of the songs she wrote by herself she writes "" I used to be able to get away with anything, now I can't get away"" Huh? A few of the songs deliver upbeat choruses that I liked but in the future Michelle, get some help!! I will be more supportive then when she realizes she isn't Neil Sadaka."
1,Very boring cd,"I loved Michelle's first cd. Its still one of my favorite cd's I own, but her second one is very boring. Besides a few songs, they almost all sound the same. It was a VERY big dissapointment.I may think twice before I buy another one of her cds again. Don't waste your money like I did."
2,"Typical, predictable and unoriginal","This is just the kind of music I expected from Michelle... and every other self-proclaimed ""singer, songwriter and musician supposedly playing alternative pop with a rock edge"". I find that Michelle's singing sounds like she's whining, it's not distinctive at all and absolutely boring. Her lyrics just might as well be Avril ""I-write-and-play-guitar! Honestly!"" Lavigne's lyrics chopped up and reassembled with a different tune! Her fans would just lap it up and STILL give stellar reviews. In fact, that just might be true... Nice job changing your image, by the way. Copying a copycat (Avril) and acting like a spoiled, immature snot who shoots off their mouth too often. I guess that's what kids like now-a-days: loud, rude, cookie cutter (looks-wise and music style) brats who put down others to seem hardcore. More reasons not to blow 20$ on this ""album""! Hell, not even 15$!"
1,YAWNING,"Michelle Branch's music could be clumped together in the same genre as bands like Matchbox Twenty and Train. I.E. people who think they're being 'alternative' or 'edgy'. Some may call it pop/rock but it is really more pop than rock. Michelle lacks in the lyric department tremendously to ever be compared to Alanis Morissette. Many of her songs blend together and sound the same. I admit, I kinda liked 'Desperately' and 'Till I Get Over You' but the rest was so boring and bland. Sorry Michelle, but I'd rather listen to Alanis Morissette, early Jewel, PJ Harvey, or Tori Amos anyday than you."
4,Inspiring and Upbeat!,"Michelle is the ideal musical recording artist, she writes or at least cowrites almost all her songs,plays her guitar in each song, has a crisp, classy voice and is charismatic.My favorite tracks on the album would have to be:Hotel Paper: It seems almost an autobiographical song, writing her songs on hotel paper, traveling everywhere. A unique, beautiful slow song.Are You Happy Now?: Its a fun, somewhat demanding song, asking if her boyfriend is happy now!!I think it got a Grammy, it is an awfully fun song, very upbeat.Love Me Like That: A fresh rock duet with Sheryl Crow. My favorite song on the C.D. There voices compliment each other so well, and it is also a great song!Those are my top favorite songs, but the whole C.D. is worth it, Michelle is truly a great recording artist."
5,Absolutely Amazing,"Michelle truly outpours her heart in every lyric of every song. With cathy melodies and touchy lyrics, this a cd that anyone could enjoy. From the intro to the last song, the whole cd will catch you by suprise because of how much one girl has grown up in just 2 years."
5,Awesomeness at it's Best.,"It owns. Who cares about the negative thing the other critics say..theyre dumb. All the tracks are awesome, the lyrics are amazing. Go and pick up a copy. ... Rockk on.And..she's hot =]"
1,Michelle needs production value to hide her weak voice.,"This album is a stinker. She went for a blues/ acoustic sound she doesn't have the voice to deliver the goods. I don't think should would have made it to the top 32 in American Idol because her voice is very lacking.She may write her own songs but they are unoriginal and and just plain terrible. I can admire the fact that wanted to change her image and try to copy Avril, but not on my dime. That being said, her voice sounds better on the album, than in concert. She's very pitchy during live performances.'Are you Happy Now' is best song on the album and that isn't saying much. 'Hotel Paper' is the worst song in the album."
3,"""Maybe this wind blowing in just came from the ocean...""","Michelle Branch's Hotel Paper does not stand up next to her debut album, The Spirit Room. Nothing is drastically that wrong with Hotel Paper, is just not a well-balanced album. Songs i do appreciate include:Are you happy now, Find your way back, empty-handed, love me like that (deut with Sheryl Crow), Breathe, and Hotel Paper. The rest of the songs just don't stick with you, i tried to like these songs but i just couldn't. Michelle Branch is a great, talented artist but hopefully her next record will move me like her first album. It's a good sophomore effort though."
5,Awesome!,"This CD is not to be missed - with ""Till I Get Over You""'s incredible harmonization, and the catchy, singable releases such as ""Breathe"" and ""Are You Happy Now"", this CD is a great follow up to her ""The Spirit Room"". Michelle's really grown, and her songs have become a little more complex and well written. Don't hesitate to get this CD!"
4,Hotel Paper or Spirit Room ?,"When I first listen to this CD, it seems that the songs are not as melodic as the ""spirit room"", and it is not as ear-catching as it. However, after a while when I listen to it, I found out that the songs become more mature. It is deeper. I'm not only talking about the lyrics, but the taste, the style. It has some trace of jazz music. This jazz-feel is shown especially in the song ""Desperately"", which is absent in ""the Spirit Room"". To my opinion, ""Hotel Paper"" is more original, more of an out-break. ""Are you happy now?"" still retains Michelle's style in ""all you wanted"" and ""everywhere"", while the other songs have a new style. Don't just hear music, you listen to it, and you'll find savour in Michelle's ""Hotel Paper""."
2,sophomore jinx?,"I absolutely adored her debut 'The Spirit Room' and was anxiously awaiting this new album. Although I really like the single 'Are You Happy Now?', I'm quite disappointed with the rest of the album. I liked the catchy, strong melodies along with the sophisticated instrumental arrangements on the first album. Although Michelle's voice is in absolutely fabulous form on this album, the songs just kind of meander and are rather boring. Sorry Michelle! I'm sure many fans will like this album but it just doesn't do it it for me. However, Michelle is such an incredible talent that I'm sure that in the future she'll create music that I'll love as much as her first album."
2,Very Disappointing...,I found this CD extremely disappointing. It seems like she is trying to hard to show her singing ability and because of this the music does not seem as developed. The songs are very hum drum and typical. I have been anticipating this CD for a long time only to be disappointed. Don't purchase this unless you are a Michelle Branch fanatic.
3,Not thoroughly impressed,"Michelle's new cd is pretty good, except her voice can get annoying sometimes, and if you listen to it for more than an hour, her voice can start to sound the same. Tuesday morning is a nice track that wasn't annoying, i loved the mood it gave. Her duet with sheryl crow wasn't too bad, although their voices did sound the same at some parts and it was hard to tell who was singing. The song was almost country. Overall, I liked the cd more than the first and she has definetely grown into a more mature person and she has most definetely improved in everything. Good job Michelle!"
4,Hotel Paper Rox!,This c.d is sure to please fans of Branch's past albums. Her voice gets better and better with every c.d she makes and this is a must have!
4,Intriguing,"I am going to be honest, I love some of the songs on this CD, especially tracks two and seven. I have to admit that Michelle Branch has a strong voice and great sounding songs. The songs above mentioned were worth the album price alone. There are parts that are slow and boring but those tracks are great. Overall, worthy of the four stars."
4,A Decent Album Worth Buying,"Although Michelle Branch sometimes comes off as a bit pop-y, this is definately a good album on her part. The songs feature a range of emotions and are done in a way that you are carried on the emotional roller-coaster with her as she sings them. It's easy to sing along to, it keeps you wanting more, and it's obvious that she's grown since her The Spirit Room. Some bands and artists out there sound extrememly one-noted, but she surprises you with every song. The song ""Breathe"" is catchy, ""Love Me Like That"" is country-ish without being obnoxious, and ""Tuesday Morning"" is slightly bittersweet without being depressing. Definately something I'm glad i bought."
5,Soooo Good!,"Michelle has come back strong with a more ""guitar"" based album. Most of her first album was very ""pop like"" and good, but this album shows growth. All the tunes are super catchy and the hooks are so well written.1. Intro2. Are You Happy Now? 5/53. Find My Way Back 5/54. Empty Handed 5/55. Tuesday Morning 10/5 OMG the BEST track on the CD6. One Of These Days 1/5 (Kinda lame, gave me a headache)7. Love Me Like That 3/5 (Nice collaboration, drags on though)8. Desperately 5/59. Breathe 5/510. Where are You Now? 1/5 (Ugh, not my fav)11. Hotel Paper 10/5 (Well written lyrics, country vibe, I love it)12. Til I Get Over You 4/513. It's You 5/5 (Nice way to end the CD with a short, but acoustic track)"
3,"A Sleepy Album,yet Rock oriented","""Hotel Paper"" is to me not as good as ""The spirit room"" but it still is good to me.""Are you happy now?"" appeals to alot of people but to me its not my type of song.The songs to look out on for this album are ""Tuesday Morning"",""Hotel Paper"",""Everywhere""** and ""The Game Of Luv*.See? those r my fave songs but nevertheless good job Michelle but try something a little less ""Avril/Norah"" next time.**Everywhere is from ""The Spirit Room"" and is on the NZversion of ""Hotel Paper""**The Game Of Love is from Santana's Album ""Shaman"" and is also a single and features on ""Hotel Paper"" New Zealand version"
1,"No, I'm not happy now :(","The spirit room is my all-time favorite cd, with songs that all tell a story and keep interest. Hotel Paper, though highly anticpated, was a disapointment from the start. Michelle seems to try to sound more punk in this cd and slows down her songs. She repeats choruses over and over and each song has a reused feel to it. The only song that's decent and seems genuine is Are You happy now? we only have to wonder with all the reinventing michelle is doing in this cd (she's so hip and --- mad? bored?) is she happy with her new cd and distressed vanessa carlton look? because i'm sure not."
1,"Boring, boring, boring...gone!","Don't waste your money on this. Every song on this CD sounds the same. In a nutshell, she's only a so-so singer, can't write and her musical ability is zero. She ends up just another cookie from that same old mold."
1,EEEEEEEEEEE,"a one star hotel with cockroaches and broken things. LOTS of broken disturbing things. on tv there's nothing like a DEEP are you happy now video in a playground. Sorry but stop trying to be alanis! no, really SHUT UP!"
1,"Lost the ""spirit"" on this CD","This CD is bad. Her first CD there was only 1 song I didn't like...but now on this CD it's so...different... She's better when she doesn't write from her own experiences. All the songs sound the same, they all pretty much say the same thing, and they're all BORING! There's almost no repetative tune in any song to keep the hook going. It's so boring. DO NOT BUY THIS CD! I only hope other great artists out there, like Avril Lavigne, have a better comeback than Michelle does. I don't seen Michelle making a 3rd album. I really don't."
3,I'm not happy now,This CD is a departure from her 1st. It is good dont get me wrong but it dosent hold a candle to the Sprit Room.
1,Sadly Dissapointed,"I absolutly loved Michelle Branch's First Signed Album. There wasnt a single song on that cd that I didnt like. I also loved Her first CD, Broken Bracelet (Only available on her website). But this CD seemed to lack the heart Michelle had in the first 2 CDs. Maybe its just that the first 2 I could actually see myself on the otherside of the lyrics, But the new one, I just have a hard time seeing myself anywhere. Sorry Michelle, I love your music, but this one was definately not your best."
2,"Not a complete waste, but close enough","Michelle's new CD is a major disappointment. Her voice sounds weak, and the production is overblown. I don't know if her music is evolving (and she's just a little lost at the moment), or regressing. I am leaning towards the latter. I want my money back..."
1,Rubbish,"This CD is an Atlanis Morissete knock-off, simply put. Michelle please stop being a whiner and write some good songs.I rate it no star."
5,Michelle Rocks!!!,"Whoever gave Michelle 1 star, should be in the hospital.Thay are mental! I am listening to Hotel Paper at this moment,I just bought it today. My favorite is ""Are you happy now?""Go, Michelle!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Is she happy now?,"Instead of calling it Hotel Paper, call it Toilet Paper! I've heard far better singers than her!"
1,YAWN,"I had a hard time getting all the way through these songs without punching the skip button on the cd player. Every song is a replica of the previous song; guitar, vocals, etc. The angst that she expresses in her music is forced and unbelievable. I don't think she should give up music to go into acting anytime soon. On second thought, she should rethink the music scene as well."
4,Til I get over this,Her cd is good. Its kind of some what over rated since her last cd.buy itit is goodnot so badi own it and its great
4,Pop music that will BRANCH out !,"MICHELLE BRANCH is an artist who is at the forefront of a movement to stream down the sound of pop music. Less fluff and more substance.MICHELLE's vocals are placed up front in the mix on her CD ""HOTEL PAPER"". She demonstrates a natural control in vocal technique that is both instinctive and talented yet not requiring the annoying vocal acrobatics of MARIAH, CELINE and those other outdated divas.The song content on this CD is above par for Pop music.The tracks ""BREATHE"" and ""TUESDAY MORNING"" are perfect examples of great POP music.If you'd like JEWEL with more of an edge, then this is the product for you!"
1,Disappointed,"I have to admit, that when I bought Michelle's first album, The Spirit Room, having heard only one song off it Everywhere, I was pleasantly surprised when I loved every song. Buying Hotel Paper, having only heard Are You Happy Now?, I was expeting the same. I was sorely disappointed. This album, with the exception of Are You Happy Now? and a few others (including, I believe, One of These Days and, actually, Tuesday Mornings) the rest really...I was quite, well, disappointed. I suppose I was expecting more of the same, Happy-Go-Lucky, hip things that Spirit Room provided, and was rewarded with more dark sounds. The music didn't really seem to jive with the lyrics right, and it is nowhere near as catchy as her Freshman Album. I bought this CD over another I was considering (Evanessance) with the faith that Michelle would not disappoint me. She did, and I'm now quite sorry that I hadn't chosen the other CD."
4,"Plug in, Sit Back, and get ready to be amazed!","A lot of growth can be seen since this artist's last album. With lyrics that can have you thinking twice about the way you look at everyday life you can't afford not to go and buy Hotel Paper. Michelle Branch shows in this album that she is not just a typical pop star and that there is more to her than meets the eye. The music is awesome, vocals are great, a definate MUST HAVE!"
1,I'm So Sad,"I'm quite sad this CD was such a disappointment. I really liked Spirit Room so I was quite excited when Hotel Paper was released. ""Are You Happy"" is a good song but that's about as far as it goes for me on this CD. I wish I could have heard it all before wasting my money."
1,I want to check out of this hotel!,"What in the world is this!, this album is not close to Spirit Room, what a bad album, only the lead single, but not even that!, i thought a good song like ALL YOU WANTED promised a good sophomore album! but this! I'm not a music expert but, I don't like the album, try JEWEL'S 0304(kind of rock meets new wave/pop) or ANNIE LENNOX ""Bare"", even though they're more pop than this, Hotel Paper is truly not worth buying except if you're a Michelle Branch Fan!"
2,Bad News - Good News,Bad news is that I wasted my time listening to this whinefest.Good news is that I bought it used.I give it two stars because there are two tolerable songs on the CD and she is a cutie.More good news. I re-sold it for my purchase price.
1,Going down hill.,"Her other cd's were so much better. I don't think she will be around too much longer, if she records anymore like this one."
1,NO talent Avril wanna be,"Michelle branch's music is a bunch of screams that don't say much. She is a screamer with an annoying voice, not a singer.Her voice is screechy and she has no talent.She has no class and she also bashes other artists she doesn't even know. Her 15 minutes should be up soon . She has already overstayed her welcome and needs to spend some of the money she has made on some ethics classes.I have listened to most songs that are in her album (what a task) and buying it would be a big waist of money. Don't do it."
1,If Amazon allowed 0 stars....,"I'd think about rating this a zero. Sorry to say, this singer's voice and choice of tracks are both fairly ho-hum. I am a little curious about those who rate Ms. Branch with 5s--I think a 1 might even be overly generous."
3,Songs -r- to similar,I rated Michelle's new CD Hotel Paper 3 stars. Almost all of the songs sound to alike to me and they sound like they are all based on the the same recycled feeling. I enjoyed her first album The Spirit Room more than this one. But this CD is ok.
4,Michelle Dodges the Sophmore Jinx!,"Michelle pulls off what will certainly be another block buster album. The songs on this album sounds like they come from the heart and are backed by what this beautiful young talent has experienced along her rapid rise to super stardom. The lyrics are deep and more sophisticated than those on ""The Spirit Room"". Sheryl Crow joins Michelle and they Rock on the track ""Love me Like that"". There isn't a bad song on this Album. Love me Like That, Desperately, Breathe,Where Are You Now, Hotel Paper, and Wanting Out are stand outs on this Album. Just Buy the Album and listen to it then listen to it Again and Again. The bottom line, this is an Artist that will have some serious longevity in the business. I raise my glass to you Michelle....... You Rock!"
2,pretty average,yeah She plays&has had some success&whatnot but alot of Her Material seems just kind of there.I Compare Her Musical Progression with Jewel in that while She does quite well&Writes&Plays Her own stuff it just doesn't carry alot of Musical weight for My ears.
4,A most impressive and artful album,"In her own words this album most definately tells a story. 'Hotel Paper' is a must purchase album, only from purchasing this album can one truly appreciate the 'album' as an artform. Michelle's songs have a prevelant theme, one of lost love, and yet somehow they leave us with hope. Purchase Hotel Paper, it deserves a place in anyone's collection. Love you Michelle."
5,Great album from all the rest of the junk out there,"Michelle Branch's ""Hotel Paper"" is a great sophomore album. Michelle and her team of producers bring back what music hasn't been in awhile: pure guitar and piano. Each song has a catchy melody and riff and great lyrics to back it all up. I would definately reccomend purchasing this CD for anyone of any age. It's nice to see an artist these days who come up with their own material and has great potential for more great albums to come."
4,"Good overall, some incredible standouts","In terms of average quality I would probably say I prefer The Spirit Room to Hotel Paper, though not by much. On the other hand, there are some songs on this album that stand out more than anything did on her first CD. ""Are You Happy Now?"", ""One of These Days"", and ""Find Your Way Back"" are all inspired, but ""Breathe"" stands above even them as one of the best songs I have ever heard. If you liked The Spirit Room, I would definitely suggest this CD to you."
2,Just Bad In General,"Hey, Michelle, you ""Desperately"" need new music. I don't know how long it'll be ""Til I Get Over You"" and your bad CD. ""One Of These Days"" I'm going to burn it.Is it just me or do all the songs sound alike, not to mention equally bad? It's like country music gone wrong! And I don't even like country music to begin with!! It sounds like some drunk girl in a NYC bar at one in the morning to me. It's so.....whiny! And what's with that intro!"
3,"Good, but doesn't do much for me...",it's refreshing to hear a singer/songwriter succeed as she has. But it's only average to me. Good but not great.
3,A few great songs but a disappointment overall...,"I LOVED her first CD, it's one of my favorites ever. However, I was terribly disappointed with this CD. There are three wonderful songs on the CD: ""Breathe,"" ""Find My Way Back"" and ""Are You Happy Now."" ""Where Are You Now"" is a pretty good song but the others were not too good. The three great songs show a range in her voice and lyrics. She sounds like Michelle Branch on them. But others, like ""Tuesday Morning"" are rather whiny and she just doesn't sound like she has the support behind her voice. She has a lot of different sounds vocally on this CD. It is almost worth buying because those few songs are so good. Still, it's not her best work. I'm still a Michelle Branch fan, just not a fan of this CD!"
3,good pop cd,"Although I give Hotel Paper and The Spirit Room the same amount of credit for being good pop albums, I think the only semi-original sounding song on the Hotel Ppaer album is ""Are You Happy Now."" I reccomend this cd for ppl who like pop-countty music...I think this cd is more reminisant of pop-country, rather than pop."
3,What Happened?,"When I heard Michelle was releasing ""Hotel Paper"", I just knew it was going to be the bomb! I figured her music would reflect artistic growth, but it seems that only happened partially. I did enjoy ""Are You Happy Now"", ""Breathe"" and ""Find My Way Back""...and I was thoroughly impressed with ""One of These Days"", especially considering the fact that she wrote the song in only 10 minutes; quite impressive in my opinion...but that's pretty much it. The rest of the cd is not quite ""there"" for me. I was expecting the duet with Sheryl Crow to blow me away, but it didn't and neither did anything else. I was expecting ""Hotel Paper"" to reflect a musical elevation on Michelle's behalf, but I found myself pushing it aside in favor of her debut cd. Maybe next time..."
2,how incredibly dull,".....but talented nontheless.i give her credit for not having to tramp herself up in order to push sales.very refreshing.seems as though 90% of female performers need to be as trashy as they can(so many sexstarved teen boys).they also need to splash their made up faces on the covers of thier cds.they know,their produsers know,their labels know,MTV knows that if not for the trampware,those same 90% would go ignored!the day that they are not pictured in their videos would be a refreshing day.while skimming through the telly,i bumped into an ashlee simpleson show snipette.....she had a bunch of her cronies urging her ''not to speak.so she can save her voice''!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!THAT ABOUT SUMS IT ALL UP NICELY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Hotel Paper is Deep and relaxing,"To make this CD, Michelle obviously pulled her thoughts and ideas deep within her soul. The lyrics are very philosophical and the production was wonderful. The songs weren't overpowered by heavy guitars, etc.When I first purchased this CD, I was somewhat disappointed. But when I later started listening to it more thoroughly, I discovered just how great it is. If you buy this CD and don't like it, listen to it again. I guarantee you'll change your mind.This CD has a great variety of songs. Among all of them, ""Are You Happy Now?"", ""Breathe"", ""Where are you know"", ""Tuesday Morning"", and ""Hotel Paper"" are my favorites.A GREAT PURCHASE"
1,Bad Editing,"This was one of the worst editing jobs I've ever seen. Paragraphs repeated. Words that shouldn't have been, were capitalized in the middle of sentences. And in one case, a sentence stopped, in mid-sentence, and was never finished."
5,Bryce 5 Handbook,This book is a good intro to Bryce 5. It is not an exhaustive volume on the never ending intricacy's of Bryce.I learned many new techniques by following the clear examples presented. I own a copy of Susan Kitchens Bryce 4 bookwhich is probably the holy grail of Bryce material but the Bryce 5 handbook is fun and essential.
1,Stay Away,"If you are evening considering for a second to buy this book, do one thing first, type Shamms Mortier (the author) into the amazon search engine and arrange the books from their publication date. Scan the titles and note the number of stars his past books have received. He has five 1 star books, twelve 2 star books, and two 3 star books. Surprisely he has no 4 or 5 star books. Shamms has a repuation for writing books of extremely low quality on topics he knows nothing about. He's also infamous for his 'max-the-parameter' style teaching in which he instructs the reader to crank an option to its highest setting to see what it does. He's really a horrible teacher, because he doesn't know the material, doesn't have any artistic ability, doesn't know how to write, and doesn't care about the end product. He also doesn't seem to care about ripping off his fellow man.So enough about him, how was the book? It [stinks]. If you like to waste your money, there are much better ways."
1,Poor Book,With the many good books out there related to Photoshop and other graphic programs it is a shame that this book is the only one available for Bryce 5. Someone ought to take this author aside and help him reduce his arrogant attitude related to teaching. It is not OK to tell someone who needs help that the authors instructions are to be at a level for experts and that he is not going to stoop so low as to explain fundamentals.I rated this book as a 1 and would have given it a 1/2 star if such a rating existed.I actually found the Bryce 5 instruction book that came with the software to be more helpful than this book.
2,"Technically accurate, but not worth the money","While this is the only Bryce 5 reference I am aware of, I would still sooner recommend Susan Kitchens' Real World Bryce 4. Mortier's handbook is technically accurate and covers the essentials, but so do the manual and third-party web tutorials. While Kitchens' book is insightful artisitcally and contains complex, practical, and appealing examples, Mortier's book appears simplistic and sloppy. Read the manual and buy Real World Bryce 4 if you want something more."
1,Buy Real World Bryce 4 Instead.,"Even if you are currently using version 5 of Bryce, there is only one book available that is worth you dollars, and that is Real World Bryce 4 by Kitchens and Gavenda. Real World Bryce 4 is an excellent reference for the software. The only major differences between Bryce 4 and Bryce 5 are tree lab and metaball. Both of these utilities are easy to learn, therefore you are better with the Real World Bryce 4 book and referring to the manual for these 2 utilities."
1,Worse than I expected,"Because the book has such bad ratings I really didn't want to take a chance on it, but there's precious little out there on Bryce and I take the view that a few good ideas or hours saved will pay for even a marginal book. No. Not this time. The book is almost unreadable so I can't swear that there's nothing good in it somewhere, but I looked for as long as I could bear the poor writing and the outright mistakes. A very disappointing waste of time."
5,The best reference,I really enjoy reading and studying this book. It is a blessing that I was able to read a little of my friends book before purchasing my own. He was able to show me how he uses this as a reference. I liked the book so much that I also ordered a copy for my wife.
5,The Learning Bible NIV version,"The bible was just what I was looking for, very informative and easy to use. Great for my bible study class."
5,Great Bible,"Love this bible, am almost thru my first reading, have given two as gifts. Easy to read and understand."
3,Wonderful illustrations but binding is of very poor quality,"First, always remember: a Bible is a Bible. That is, if it's a New International Version Bible, as this one is, the text is the same no matter what bells and whistles are added to the particular edition.Second, this edition has the best and widest variety of illustrations and art reproductions I've ever seen. The margin notes are helpful mainly for beginning to advanced beginning Bible students, but the illustrations are wonderful for everybody.But third, unfortunately, the binding is very, very poor quality and is already pulling apart after only sitting upright on my shelf for about three months! I hate that; to do such a superb job on the illustrations and then put such a poor quality binding on the book is unpardonable.I would have rated this much higher, probably five stars, if the binding had been of acceptable quality."
2,not that funny,too many scene cuts. took him a while to get started and then spent like 45 minutes talking about cell phones. not that funny.
1,Not as funny as the prior ones.,"I have all his DVD's and this is the only one I am re=-selling. It just isn't that funny. And trust me, if you are a Republican, you will get very upset at the digs at Sarah Palin, Chrisine O'Donnell, and Michelle Bachman. So three females get horribly dissed, as does the Tea Party. Lewis may claim to dislike both parties, but it becomes very obvious where his sympathies lie. I recommend any other DVD of his, just not this one.Not because of the politics alone, but it just was not very funny."
1,Bad Blu rays??,"I would love to review this blu-ray, but this is the SECOND copy I have received that will NOT play! I did not have trouble with any other blu-rays that I ordered....Manufacturing defect??"
1,"Lewis Black was GREAT in the past..,","I have every previous Lewis Black DVD. They are very entertaining. I don't know what happened during this performance. It was not funny at all. It was painful to watch. It seemed as if his remaining remnants of sanity were running away from him. If you are a Lewis Black fan, it will break your heart to watch this. Do yourself a favor....do not watch this...hold on to all your positive memories of Lewis Black. This performance will leave only negative imprints."
1,Not funny...,"I was really disappointed in this Lewis Black special. I enjoyed his bits about AT&T;/Droid andFarmville but that's about all. Overall, an embarassing performance."
4,Classic Black,"This is another performance of what we've come to expect and laugh about from Lewis Black. Some of the material hit me so hard I couldn't stop wiping the tears from my eyes. It has a few lulls here and there but you never know when the one that gets to you will hit. Blu-ray looked and sounded fabulous. If you are a big fan then you probably own this already but if you haven't purchased it yet, add this to your collection."
1,Lewis Black fails.,"We have seen most other videos of Lewis Black and love him. However, this video is a waste of time. He is so subdued that he has lost his ""touch"". We kept waiting for him to explode and go nuts but he didn't. It was a waste of money."
5,excellent explanation,"This book provides an excellent explanation of the development and roots of Chinese religion and how it is not compartmentalized into strict categories as religions are in Western culture. It also compares Chinese religion with the teachings of the Baha'i Faith, one of youngest world religions, and finds a number of basic parallels."
4,Short and Sweet,"It's a good CD that I reccomend if you enjoyed the music you heard from her on the Juno soundtrack.However, for 15 dollars you'd think they wouldn't completely F you in the A on the packaging. All you get is a simple cardboard sleeve which offers absolutely zero protection for your 15 dollar investment in this band. Way to skimp. I'd understand this if the CD cost 6-10 dollars - but being as this is one of the most expensive CD's I've purchased in a long time you'd expect some sort of decent treatment for the physical product."
3,Kimya Dawson is more than a song or two of the Juno soundtrack,"I liked her music off the Juno soundtrack that I bought the company... I mean her CD... Despite most of the songs sounding the same, the lyrics and progressions make this effort rather interesting...."
5,Great Music!,"I was mostly used to modern pop music, but after hearing Kimya Dawson songs on ""Juno"" I decided to buy this CD. I was a little disappointed that my package came late, but I enjoyed the CD. I started listening to alternative folk and other songs like this even retro music."
1,Superficial and of very little practical use.,"I was very disappointed when I got this book (which I bought right here based on the previous positive reviews) - after about ten minutes I found I had wasted my money for just another photo book which serves more as some kind of portfolio for the author's work instead of delivering lots of useful information to help the reader. One might get over this if Blair's images were indeed outstanding - but unfortunately the are very conventional, very stiffly posed, and VERY 80's style! They annoy me so much it is hard to concentrate at the text.The lighting advice given is very basic and only loosely connected with the image examples given. As a professional photographer I was looking for a book with a strategic view on portraiture lighting, how to create different moods and emotions with a broad choice of light sources, interpreting personality, some new ideas to spark my creativity. I guess will have to look elsewhere..."
2,"Lots of fluff, no meat","I was rather disappointed with this book. I found it to be written at a fairly high level in two ways. First I felt that there were many technical terms that the reader was assumed to be familiar with already. The author used 'bare bulb', 'wrapping the light', and 'feathering' frequently without ever explaining what he meant. It was also high level in that he discuss in vague terms how he obtained a picture, but never got into the details. For example, there were no diagrams of the lighting in respect to the pictures. I'd rather he spent more time explaining how he get the shots and less time showing off his pictures."
4,Photographer - part time,"Don Blair is the ""Big Daddy"". He is a true artist and teacher. I try to read all of his books and view his training videos. Most (not all) of the material in this book he has written or said before. If this is your first book by Don then buy it. I do wish he had put lighting diagrams in along with some of the pictures. I HIGHLY recommend his book ""Body parts."""
2,Boring...,"Maybe this is 2007, I find this style of photography doesn't sell very well in today consumer tastes. Yes, Mr. Blair is a master as well as Zucker; nonetheless, my clients want natural and fun. If I pose them and hold for the shot, their reaction is ""I don't like to pose."" On the other hand, there are some good lighting tips and hand position that are important to keep in mind."
1,Very disapointed !,"I expected this book to be very useful, since it's written by a master portrait photographer. But I found it to be completely useless. Sample photos on this book look ackward and posing forced and also very, very outdated. It's the only photography book I own that I wish i never bought!. Sorry to say, but I considere it a waste of my money!"
2,Not Impressed...,"Nothing struck me as intriguing, interesting or new in this book. It's just a book of mostly mundane very normal typical photography. I was hoping for a new spin on the old habit."
1,paper embellished art quilts,I don't know what I was thinking when I ordered this title. I thought it would include fabric stamping not just paper stamping. This is for scrapbookers more than quilters. The quilts are made by embellishing with paper that has been rubber stamped and objects glued onto the project. Not washable and definately not for me. Doesn't seem very durable and falls into art quilt catagory. I was interesting in learning more about embellishing quilts but paper and glued objects does not do much for me. I am sure it would appeal more to the scrapbooker or fiber artists more than a more traditional quilter who enjoys fabric and washable quilts.
5,Good book lots of tips.,Nice book. Worth the money. Buy any book that lets you look inside. DON'T if they don't let you look inside. It's not fair of them to not let you look inside.
1,Sent me the wrong item,"They sent me the wrong item. I ordered the Large Paw stocking, which is supposed to be in the shape of a dogs paw. However, I recieved a regular stocking with 3 paw prints on it. It is nothing like what I ordered. Then when I called they told me it was sold out approximately a month ago, and just forgot to take it off their website. Now the christmas gifts are ruined, thanks to their laziness and inept customer service."
4,Great Stocking but NO PEN INCLUDED!,"I gave this stocking 4 stars, wanted to give 5 but there was no glitter pen included to write my pet's name. I'll have to go out and buy one now. I would've still given the stocking 5 stars but that really all depended on how the glitter pen worked but I never received it. The stocking itself is really nice and cute. I bought the large to fit in with the rest of the family stockings. Perfect for our German Shepherd."
4,Adorable decoration,"This little Christmas Paw stocking is adorable. I purchased it along with the larger one since I have a small Peke-poo mix and an English bulldog. Although the stocking is cute, it has a very small opening so it makes it difficult to put anything in it. Overall the stocking goes well with my Christmas decorations, very happy with purchase."
5,Super cute,"I got this stocking to put goodies for my fat for christmas. It was adorable, and not to mention vey well made."
3,Not what I ordered,"Same for me, they sent the one with 3 paw prints, did not contact me. It's ok, just not what I ordered."
1,Very Poor,"The compnay was out of the product I ordered, so they sent the wrong product without attempting to contact me, and charged my credit card as well. It took three phone call before they finally credited my account."
2,Didn't look like the picture,The stocking came in a red stcking (not paw) shape with the paw embroidered on in white. I was disappointed (i thought the paw shape was cooler.)
3,It's small!,I had a hard time fitting much in this stocking for my dog. I didn't realize how small it would be. It's better suited for a tiny dog or a cat.
3,For my cat,"I had ordered Christmas Paw stocking size small. I didn't know what size small was going to be witch had me worried. To my surprise, it was what I would call a med,Lg. I was happy with my order."
3,Worked out fine but some reservations.,"The color is much lighter than depicted in the picture. It is predominantly a light sage green and cream - not the deep honey in the picture. Fortunately this still matches my decor, but it would have been annoying and frustrating if it hadn't! One of the blinds bows out toward the center, though both were hung identically. Despite these reservations the blinds look nice. They were reasonably priced, I saved a lot with free shipping and they arrived in good time and were undamaged; so overall, I'm satisfied with my purchase."
1,It wasnt as good as I was hoping for,"I bought it as a gift for my boyfriend because he loves all things rincewind.We popped it in and found the catchphrases repetitive and annoying and some of the ""puzzles"" were next to impossible.Overall, not that fun, no matter how much you love discworld."
1,Canon i320 Printer,"Upon arrival via priority mail and connecting to computer, received error message. Tried to resolve with seller and onsight;but could not. Am returning printer for full refund. Seller agreed. Again very helpful and ready to satisfy the customer. Perhaps, damaged in shipment, not sure what occurred."
1,not for linux,"I Have dual operating systems , linux and windows and this printer does not support printing from linux, you have to buy a driver apx. $30 for linux.If you think at some point of time you might want to try a different operationg system then this is not for you ."
4,happy consumer,i basically brought this printer for my 11 year old son school projects and my occasional print jobs and i found myself to be lucky with this one. first i must say the extremely fast shipping from amazon.com (2 days and it was free) then the cheap price with the rebate.WOW.. you cant beat it. easy step by step set up. printing quality was superb. i didn't give it the big 5 stars because it is quite noisy. i can deal with it though.the small compact size makes it the ideal printer for the bucks.
4,not bad for this price,"Thanks for the fast shipping, Amazon. Liked this printer so far, the printing is fine. I like to print my millions of reading articles in draft ink setting and this printer gives a greyish print when set to that mode, my eyes are okei with it, in fact, it gave me the good feeling that it is helping me saving ink! A little noisy that is, and oh Canon, next time please include a USB cable. [I had to purchase that separately] It was a good thing this printer is inexpensive here in Amazon."
4,Great bargain for the price!,"I bought this this printer mainly because of the review in PC World. I was so tired of wasting money on ink cartridges for my Lexmark. When I saw the price of cartridges for this printer and read the review, I immediately went online and bought it and I'm glad that I did. The text is very clean and the skin tones seem natural on glossy photo paper. The only complaint I have with this printer is the long time it takes to warm up before printing. It rolls and rolls and rolls, stops, jerks, then rolls some more. I've timed it, so be prepared for about 40 secs of waiting."
2,Too noisy & fussy,"This printer makes a LOT of noise before, during, and after printing. I have mine on a sturdy table, but the whole table shakes while it is printing. You have to have plenty of paper in it, otherwise it won't print. It jams easily as well. You have to be very careful that nothing is anywhere near where the printout comes out. Otherwise the paper will go back in the printer and jam. As for the printouts, they are fine, but nothing special. Before this printer, I had an old HP deskjet printer (ca. 2000) which printed just as well, and it was also much quieter and faster. If you are looking for a really inexpensive printer, and you don't print but occasionally, this one is o.k. But if you are at all sensitive to noise, or you plan to print late at night, I would not choose this one for fear of disturbing sleeping family members or apartment neighbors."
1,NEGATIVE 5 STARS,"This is is the ONLY bad product I've bought from Amazon in three years of shopping. What's worse, I CANNOT fathom the preponderance of positive reviews!! I've been working with computers and printers for eleven years -- so forget about my ignorance. I'm pretty sure I know what I'm doing. This thing has not accepted a SINGLE sheet of 20-lb. plain paper. Not a single sheet! I don't what's going on with all these great reviews?! Are they using magic paper? This thing is going back into the box, back to Amazon. I want my money back. One good thing, Amazon has always treated me right -- five stars for customer service."
1,0 Rating,"I ordered the i320 Canon printer because I used one for 7 years till it quit feeding paper. The 1st one I ordered was re-furbished and would not feed the paper The seller gave me my money back and did not want the printer returned as they had another one & tested it & it did not feed paper either.So I ordered a 2nd i320 from another seller that was brand new & cost way too much. It arrived still in it's original box and packing, removed all packing set it up and paper would not feed. I contacted seller they do not want to refund my money. I checked with Canon and they said these printers are no longer fixable & they sent me a 20% off coupon.I am in Canada and had to pay shipping even though it was advertised as free shipping plus $68.00 for duty fees. I can not afford to send it back. The company is The Quick Ship Warehouse."
5,A real work horse,"Bought two i320's in 2003 for peanuts. Use one for business (I'm a Realtor) and one is used by my four children. Ink is cheap ($3.50 for black and $4.50 for color over the internet)and finally the one my kids use just broke. Never even cleaned the heads. I'm going to buy two more right now, one to replace the broken one and one for the wife. Great product!"
3,price is good,"The print quality for text is decent, speed is excellent, the price for ink is unbeatable. But surely it's not a photo printer(don't expect for this price). The bad thing is it's very noisy, I set it to quiet mode but it's still loud, it periodically screams no matter you print or not, and shakes the table. I wonder why Cannon put that much power for a small printer?My old printer was a Lexmark Z25, it's an ink hog and catridge is 3 times more than the Cannon. So I can live with all the noise."
3,"Perfectly fine, but not my favorite","I ordered a whole bunch of spoons recently, figuring that baby spoons are cheap enough that I can afford to become an expert on them.This spoon is fine, but not great.Pros:Longest handle of any spoon I've foundPlastic changes color when hot (very sensitive)I prefer metal to plastic spoons in all casesMy spoons have not yet stained, even with carrots (though I wouldn't care if they did) I don't know if this is variable from batch to batch of carrots, or if I've just been lucky, but I don't see staining yet.Cons:I think the head is a little too big/awkward for baby's first meals. Maybe better when they're older.I get hand-fatigue by the end of a feeding using this spoon.It's that last point that kills it for me. Holding the spoon for too long is uncomfortable. I prefer the meal-mates spoons for comfort and all-around ease of use."
4,"Easy, Peasy, Lemon Squeezy","This product is easy to use, does what it claims to do, and is priced right. I highly recommend trying it."
1,Still waiting for my items,"This site sucks.. My order has not yet arrived, Im very dissapointed. I was roibbed.. I paid for a product, you got my money and still havent deliver."
2,Doesn't cover gray well,"The shades are nice and stick well to previously dyed hair, but do not cover the gray roots as they grow out."
3,OK,"This dye is meant to be used on light or bleached hair. so if your hair is black, it will not stay.Anyway, I did bleach my hair before using this, and it's ok. It faded sooner than the usual brand of hair dye that I use, which I ended up mixing it with for the next application. I won't be buying it again, though. it also kind of smells weird, for a dye that doesn't have bleach in it."
1,Blue Streaks from a Bottle of Brown Hair Dye?!,"I expected to receive beautiful, luscious brown locks from this bottle of Jazzing hair dye. After all, the product claimed to produce a chestnut brown tint. Instead of a warm brown, I ended up seeing streaks of a bright blue amidst the brown colored hair. I followed the directions, thoroughly washed my hair, and I still could not believe what my mirror was reflecting back to me. Blue hair?!This review simply serves as a warning to those wishing to achieve warm brown hair: your end result may leave you with a streaky blue pattern throughout your hair."
2,not sturdy enough for brass terminals,"subject says all; probably quite good on poured lead terminals but won't even scratch brass. Wish I could find one with four heavy steel blades like my friend has, but it's old and probably not made anymore."
1,terrible,1/2 star if possible. nothing more to be written except had to write more than fifteen words. it sucked. dont bother
4,Intriguing Horror-Comedy,"Chop is an independent horror-comedy that is like Saw with a dark sense of humor. It's not perfect, but it is an interesting film. I really wanted to know exactly what was the motive behind all the horrible things that were happening. Directed by Trent Haaga and starring Will Keenan, both of which have starred in some Troma movies."
5,GREAT DARK COMEDY,"I bought this movie because it sounded interesting, but when I watched it I was suprised at it being so fantastic. It dosen't shy away from the grusome parts in the story, but has enough humor to keep you from getting numb. A few good twists in the plot and a few especially disturbing characters....definately worth a watch."
5,Wow! Great upbeat music,"Seriously, this music is just as much fun as dance and techno for working out. These upbeat and happy songs will get your gears moving and your spirits lifted."
3,Peepee Teepees,"It was a cute idea, but the baby moved so much when being changed the the teepees didn't stay on very long."
1,"These are cute, but they don't stay in place!","These are very small and fit over his privates nicely, but they don't stay in place when he moves his legs! A washcloth strategically placed worked much better. I wouldn't get these again."
3,pee pee tee pee,"This is such a great idea. I immediately bought them for my grandson. I tried to use them, but he wiggled it off. And is was too small! Maybe if it had a flat area that covers the skin, then a tee pee it would have stayed better. It is still a great new born gift, the men got a kick out of it also."
2,A recent purchase,"My online order of this product came faster than I expected. However, the part came some differently than what I ordered: I was shipped a black rasor screen foil assembly instead of the silver gray as advertised here. There was no explanation."
1,not original replacement,"This is not original replacement foil, hols are much smaller and it makes shaving pain in the neck - do not buy this item."
1,Great Item - NOT!,I ordered this but I received the black one and that's the reason for 4 stars. But it fits perfectly and works just fine. It's like having a brand new razor again. Get it if you want to save money!New review:NOT SHARP AT ALL. WISH I COULD RETURN IT AND BE CREDITED BACK. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.
3,Braun razor cutter and foil,"Delivered on time. Not the same color scheme as my razor, but fits and functions just fine."
3,razor foil replacement,"Works ok. I've been trying the electric razor way of shaving. Replacing an old foil seems to improved the effectiveness somewhat for a good few months at least, but probably isn't worth it if you're just planning to buy a whole new unit soon anyway."
4,Great,This works just as described. Was a little disappointed that the screen foil was not the same color as the shaver case (as pictured) but it worked perfectly and arrived quickly.
2,Poor Aftermarket Shave,I ordered this blade and foil based on price and not looking at the small print that it is an aftermarket product. The shave was never as close as the OEM Braun blade and foil. I started using my 14 month old Braun blade and foil and was getting a closer shave in less time. Would not recommend the aftermarket product. I will only order original Braun replacement parts.
3,A bargain for Lum & Abner fans,"I don't know much about the radio team of Lum & Abner, except that even their staunchest fans admit that movies weren't their best medium. Most of their films are already available from Alpha Video, but at this price, I was willing to take a chance on this title. It's a mildly entertaining comedy, perhaps better appreciated by an L&A fan than a casual viewer. The quality is hardly outstanding, though it's better than I expected-certainly better than the washed-out print they used to run on local TV a few years back."
1,Warning: You get what you pay for!!,"Purchased this grill cover before the winter season arrived. The material is complete garbage, it started ripping the first time I went to take it off. The ironic thing is that it wasn't even that it got caught on something sharp. Just was so brittle due to the cold that it started ripping. The product was cheap both in cost and construction. Don't bother with it, save your time and your money."
2,Very poorly constructed,"The grill cover was the exact right size and even has velcro adjustments on the sides but the very first time I put it on my grill, the cover ripped at the seam. Very poor construction and this cover will not last very long."
1,Don't buy,"This cover is a joke, it lasted less than a month. The seams split and wind did the rest. Spend the extra $ and maybe it'll last than more than a month. Coincidentally, the return policy expires after a month...wierd."
2,poor performance,"The unit tends to""leak"" power from one source to another and trip the power off. The fact that my units have safety features is a thankful arrangement. I would not buy this item again."
1,D-Link = Garbage,I used this card to connect my cable modem to my computer...utter garbage. It never worked...I just simply went out to a store and bought one from Sohoware.....that card worked as soon as i popped it into the computer..Another reason to stay away from D-Link is their tech support is long distance..I have to waste extra money..no way!!
5,Breakup 2 Makeup Remix,This is one of Ashanti's best singles! sadly it went unnoticed!1. Remix2. Remix Instrumental3. Call Out HookGreat Single! Must Have For Ashanti Fans!
3,Neopagan,"After listening to the CD I understand why ""My geisha"" isn't available as a single download. There's nothing else on the CD worth listening to.However ""My geisha"" is excellent."
3,Some good tunes,"I bought this CD mainly because of one tune, I found a few others I liked also. and usually with any album there is one or two do don't like."
2,Not so Hot,"A disappointment, Paolo is good on the instrumentals but should leave the singing to other artists."
2,for ocean coastal racers primarily,"This book, written in tiny typeset with light grey ink (ie talk about eye strain) largely discussed coastal wind patterns and how they might effect a sailing race. As an inland sailor, I found the information nearly worthless."
4,unique take on a familiar plot,"I expected it to be a bit serious and more angsty but was pleasantly surprised by how funny and good humored the book was..yes, the plot is far from realistic but it was still a good read..if u want to read something different give this book a try.."
5,great lynn graham book,I really loved this book. Lynn Graham wrote an inventive story that doesn't follow the same old story line. It was a fun read.
2,An Utterly Forgettable Story....,"I'm a big fan of LG, but I can only remember the cover picture & the bare plot of this book & nothing else bcs. this was an utterly forgettable story...."
1,Pajama Sam 2,My 6-year-old granddaughter says she finds this program her least favorite of all her CD's. Says it is a little confusing.
3,"Interesting, but weak finish.","Davis has certainly done her homework for this book, with a wealth of research at her disposal. As a primer for tackling difficult texts on the Old Testament, it suffices...as long as its part of a collection. From a Pastoral or Homiletic point of view, Davis' assertions come out weak and not well thought out. Her investigation of the text starts out strong, and generally ends with a soft, unassuming, Presbyterian whimper."
4,Best for 3 and up,"The title fooled me I bought this viseo. I bought it for my home daycare. I thought this would video to learn letters and begining count. This video is more advanced than that. It teachs words and begining math. It's a fun and well made video. It's jst not great for 18 to 2 1/2 yr olds. For that age group I'd suggest getting Sesame Street - 123 Count With Me, Sesame Street - The Great Numbers Game, Leap Frog - Letter Factory, & Sesame Street - The Alphabet Jungle Game"
2,the only flop in Blue's clues serial,"My daughter is a fan of Steve and Blue. She is 19 months and has been watching Blue for 4 months now. However, the ABC and 123 version bores my daughter as nothing else. She likes numbers and letters, and in fact she likes similar videos from Sesame Street. This one is too much for her? Maybe. However I've realized that she prefers Blue to Elmo, big bird & Co. But when she has to deal with numbers and letters, Sesame street is much more appealing.However, it seems that when Blue comes to deal with geometry and shapes, he perform much better. Unbeatable. It's a shame that Steve and Co. haven't issued any other video on the topic. I guess that geometry was the major of most of the creatives of the Blue's adventures."
1,Refurbished,"This is a refurbished laserjet printer. I read the ad page very closely trying to determine why the price was so low. Not seeing any reference to used or refurbished I purchased. It was only after I got my receipt from the vendor did the word refurbished appear.I am NOT commenting on the machine, only on the sales page that omits the key word that this is NOT a new machine. Very misleading."
4,Plastic feet,"One of the plastic feet on the bottom of the case came off on the second day of use. It makes you wonder about the overall quality of the case.The feet are screwed on instead of a using a rivet.Other than that, my son likes the case."
4,Thought-provoking collection of short stories,"Justice Follies is a thought-provoking collection of satirical stories that is raw, provocative, and entertaining. There is something for everyone in this montage. For those with experience in dealing with the criminal justice system, the stories are both humorous and realistic. For those interested in learning more about the system, the works provide a rare glimpse into the inter workings of the labyrinth of agencies and institutions known as the American criminal justice system.I highly recommend Justice Follies to students at both the high school and university level, as it provides an instructive and realistic portrayal of the justice system, including many of its absurdities and inefficiencies."
4,Surprisingly pleasant.,"Almost didn't rent this, as we're pretty tired of the gay, hard-done-by hustler as film premiss thing. But this is definitely not that film. Clever plot device introduces you to lots of interesting characters. Acting significantly better than most of the independent Gay/Lesbian content on Amazon."
4,A not so bad gay film for once,"I was expecting the typical ""gay"" film which appear to all be about shallow 20 something old pretty boys having all kinds of sex until ""Mr. Right of the month"" shows up. Add to that, most lower budget gay films have almost no plot(except the typical mentioned earlier) and very poor acting. Most gay films in this genre are nothing more than soft gay porn.Luckily this movie moved beyond that. This time around its about, yes, a 20 something male prostitute that for whatever unknown forces is ""stuck"" in an apartment building for he encounters a series of new ""customers"" in the same building one after another - each experience being more of a ""life lesson"" then just a trick. There is no incredible acting but its a good plot and, for once, there is substance to this gay film. I actually liked this film for a change!"
4,Nice film,"This is a good film. I found the beginning of the movie okay, but the last half was excellent. I FELT the hustler's evolution. Nice!"
4,pretty good movie,good flick. has entertainment value. worth buying for those of a special group. doesn't have the raw raw that many flicks have.
4,What It's Not & What It Is,"If you're looking for thrashing bodies with lots of skin, you won't find it in this film (or at least not much of it). This is a film about a rent boy's journey into his self, a picaresque journey compressed into a single night. In the beginning he plays whatever role his clients' fantasies demand. He casts off one role and picks up another as easily as he changes his name, which is frequently. But he is a different man at the end of the movie, when the role he slowly begins to play is his own, and it takes him by surprise. ""Strapped"" Is a fine film--beautifully written, beautifully acted, beautifully filmed. For a bonus, it's also intelligent. The review in the NYTimes is short but the reviewer understood the movie. It has a powerful impact. The director says he wants to explore ""the places in between."" I hope he keeps on exploring. What he's done here is not only memorable but masterful. You're unlikely to forget this movie."
3,"No greatness here, just OK","When I read reviews of greatness, I expect greatness.This is not my kind of movie, one of those abstract stories of discovery. However, the production of this movie is of the highest quality for this genre.The lead character sums up the entire movie when, in the movie, he asks, ""Is every man in this apartment building gay?"" The answer is yes. There you go. Now you know."
1,Strapped,"In a nutshell, garbage......! The fact that it has received such kudos is an excellent illustration of how far this ""society"" has degraded. Trash!"
2,Not Worth It,"Took a shot on this one. Wish I hadn't. There is no real continuity, except for him hustling. Even that though leaves much to be desired. If you want a sappy ending where he goes back for ""the one"" go ahead and get it, if not, don't bother."
3,A whore with a heart of gold,"This film exploits every gay stereotype. It narrates a very long night in the life of a street whore. Stuck in a building where he can't find the exit but finds himself at the end- oh pleeeaaassse! Every guy he encounters is only interested in his decease infected orifice(s). But wait, you discover he also has a heart, and so does every character he encounters. The acting and script is very poor and predictable.However, the philosophical idea of the film is interesting. It's worth renting- if all the other good movies have been rented- and of course this one is still on the shelf..."
1,AWFUL,Bought this after reading reviews. The producer must have asked all friends and family to write positive reviews. Absolutely awful. A waste of money and time.
1,Poor,"It was not what I was looking for, I would have to say I would not recommend this film to anyone."
3,Trapped,"This was a somewhat depressing film and anyone sitting in the theater would have felt trapped, rather than strapped, if they stayed through the whole thing. The theme is a common one familiar to many gay men but I am not sure watching this film will get very many to do some soul searching and change their ways."
2,Mediocre,The good acting cannot lift this mediocre movie out of its depth. It had some better moments but not enough to recommend it.
2,Rent it don't buy it,"Not a great movie. A little shallow and boring at times. If you really want a great gay themed movie, try Shelter, The Edge of Seventeen or The Wedding Banquet. Those at least have great plots and storylines."
3,STRAPPED,"To be honest, not really as enjoyable or stimulating as I was expecting or hoping. Doesn't match up to, say, MYSTERIOUS SKIN which is absolutely amazing and unmissable!!"
5,This was a great gay movie,"Serious, but not depressing with a really, really likable lead actor. I highly recommend this movie if your looking for something more than just full frontal nudity (although there's a little of that too!)"
4,BIG,"This really is as big as they state. I am glad I bought this. It was prefect for the gingerbread decorating party. I wish it was shaped a little better and not so wide and with awkward legs, but overall I like it!"
2,It's a cookie cutter.,"It's just a cookie cutter. It's a good cookie cutter, but what do you say about a cookie cutter? Good job, cookie cutter!"
5,Simply Marvelous!!,"This is one of the most under rated female rappers of our decade. She has skills that still have been unmatched. This Sacramento, CA. native is one of my all time favorite female rappers. If you ever get a chance to listen you won't be disappointed!"
1,Outdated materials lists and bad science,"I wish I hadn't bought this book. It was written in 1959 and, of course, uses 1959 household materials. When was the last time you had a glass baby bottle or even a glass soda bottle lying around? How about that screw top can of floor wax? This needs updating badly.One of the first experiments is titled, ""Which is Heavier, Hot Air or Cold?"" The explanation just concludes hot air weighs less without explaining that, with applied heat, some of the warmed air expanded out of the bottle. There's less air in the bottle to weigh!I can not recommend this book. If you use it as is, you will find yourself constantly searching for substitute materials. You will also be teaching incorrect or incomplete concepts."
4,Wish I had this tool years ago..,"Wow, this tool works great on older GM window trim and moldings. I wish I had bought one of these years ago. If you struggle with those pesky window clips and worry that you will break the glass, this tool will set you free. I removed the stainless trim on a 1971 Firebird front and back glass in about 5 minutes. Great product.."
1,Dead in 17 months in smoke alarm,"Dead in 17 months. These things are supposed to last up to 10 years in an electric smoke alarm, i.e. it doesn't power the smoke alarm, it's just there as a backup in case of power failure. Well, I purchased 14 of these, and after 17 months, two have already failed (typical beep in the middle of the night, why does it always happen at night?) and I fully expect the rest to start failing one by one. Go for another brand or stick with regular alkaline for a fraction of the cost."
1,"50% failure rate, out of the box","I've been using these batteries for over a decade. I usually buy 10 at a time. The last batch I purchased had a 50% failure rate. Opening the sealed package had batteries with leaks, discolored bodies and low voltage.Several attempts at contacting the manufacturer, including filling out the RMA form have been 100% ignored. They even have section on the website dedicated for RMAs for the batteries, so it's clear that they know about the problems.Won't ever touch anything with the Ultralife name on it.There are now other choices such as Energizer for lithium 9V cells. At least they actually honor their warranty."
1,Ultralife U9VL-BP DEAD Out of Package,"Opened up a Ultralife U9VL-BP battery which stated on thepackaging ""Best if used by 2018"". I tested battery and it isalready DEAD in 2011. Two others used in smoke detectors:one is working okay so far but other died earlier than the priorDuracell. So of the three batteries, only one ""might"" be good."
2,WAS good for a couple summers..,"I bought this pool last summer, i had to throw it away about a week ago.. birds were landing on it & drinking out of it and they popped tiny little holes in the pool. (I couldn't find the holes to patch.. just as well.) It lasted 2 summers, NOT a record for us.I bought a snapset pool because it's not inflatable. The one i had was yellow, but same idea, inflatable bottom/3 ring pool. Because of it's fragile disposition i can only give it a 2 star rating.The kids loved it while it lasted.."
1,Waste of money,"All the people giving this tea high reviews based on taste have obviously never had quality green tea. It's quite flavorless other than a bit of bitterness. A quick way to assess the quality of a green tea is to look at the color of the tea it produces. A good green tea will give a vibrant green color (hence the name), a bad one will give you various shades of brown. This tea definitely falls into the latter category. I would not recommend this product to anyone who considers themselves a fan of quality green tea, nor will I buy again."
5,Zutano never disappoints!,"I love Zutano clothing.This jacket, besides being adorable,is super comfortable, great for layering, and washes/wears fantastic. My 18 month old daughter can still wear the same one in the 6-12 month size; the sleeves are just a little short so I went ahead and ordered another in the larger side. We live in Colorado and you never know when you'll need a jacket. This is great and so easy to layer if you need more warmth. Fantastic quality!"
5,Worthwhile investment!!,"Let's face it - newborns go through clothes in what can seem like a blink of an eye. However, this piece is a solid investment. My now 6 month old has been able to comfortably wear this through 2 seasons now. At first we simply rolled up the sleeves, and now she's filling it in nicely with room to spare. Easy to get on and off with it's large buttons, and it can function as a cool weather coat or a sweater that easily layers above other clothes. It has held up well though multiple washings without pilling, fading, shrinking or hardening. I also bought one the next size up once she outgrows this one.Well worth the expense!... and as I was sitting here writing this my new one arrived on my door step, a mere 48 hours after I ordered it. Cool!"
3,Inaccurate description,"Totally concur with the previous review that this jacket is not 100% cotton. I wish I wasn't a new busy working mom and had read that review and checked the product before rushing to do laundry and ripping off the tag. Thankfully, I wrote to the seller and they refunded my money (including shipping). Turns out the actual seller has no control over the product description, which is done by Amazon."
2,Not 100% cotton,I am very disappointed--the product description above indicates that this jacket is 100% cotton. It is NOT. The tag on the jacket shows 80% cotton and 20% polyester.
2,Wrong Handle,Even though this looked exactly like the handle that needed to be replaced it was not! The underside was totally different and it didn't fit. I returned it for a refund without problem.
2,NOT a genuine MOEN part,"The part I received does NOT appear to be a genuine Moen part as described. It came with no Moen packaging and does not have the Moen logo on the face. It is apparently an imported knock-off.It is, however, functional.For those complaining about the handles breaking frequently, you need to replace the cartridge (inner workings) of the valve. The old one is probably not turning easily enough. It worked for me."
2,Faulty design,This seems to be engineered to guarantee repeat customers. The handle breaks internally after several months use. I've had to replace 3 of them for new installations. Purchased 3 to have one spare.
3,you get what you pay for,"You get what you pay for, no more, no less. any port in a storm i guess. They break easily, but you can buy these rather cheaply to get you through a year or two."
3,Moen PosiTemp Handle,I have had the same problem with the handle breaking. It has been replaced at least onece a year.
1,Too many broke. Replaced with different handle,"As many others here have noted, these plastic handles do not last. The Moen part 100710 (stamped 96997 on the handle) break fairly easily. After replacing several, I switched to a different handle. There are many Moen Posi-Temp handles that can be used in place of the 100710. Moen's web site has exploded parts views for many different models of Posi-Temp tub and shower faucets. I chose the Chateau chrome handle (part # 100657). Very simple and comes with the adapter and screws needed to install on the existing faucet. Found an online dealer that with shipping, is only a few dollars more than the 100710 price. Available here at Amazon ([...]). Save yourself some headaches and switch to something better."
3,"Just the part I need, but why do they keep breaking?","A plumber installed a Moen Posi-Temp faucet in my bathroom. Seems to work just fine, but for some reason, the handle breaks every 6-8 months (the inner plastic ring cracks and it can no longer grip the metal stem). The Posi-Temp handle does not seem to work with generic tub faucet knobs, and I cannot always find this in stores. So I now keep a spare in my house at all times. I guess I should just replace the faucet, but a new knob every 8 months is less than a plumber will charger to put in a new one, so I'm relatively happy."
2,Better buy a few,I have two tub/showers with this fixture. I probably replace this knob at least once or twice a year. The inside plastic ring breaks easily. Once broken you can not fully shut off the water flow without removing the knob and turning the brass water flow valve with a pair of pliers.Good thing they are easy to replace.But buy several to have on hand. I have 5 extras right now. Giving a low rating because of quality of knob
2,Breaks Often,"As others have said, this handle breaks often. I had the guy at our local hardware store search his book to see if there was any type of metal replacement that would fit. No such luck.Moen is raking in the bucks on replacement handles."
5,Spirit Travel With The Animals,"Anyone interested in animal totemism will love this book. Nicki Scully provides a unique opportunity to travel in guided imergery with an assortment of animal guides from North America and Egypt. Thoth, the ibis headed god, is central to the book. Nicki's frequent travels in Egypt and her considerable knowledge of the Egyptian pantheon lends it a unique and fascinating flavor. Art work by the artist of the astounding Medicine Cards, Angela Werneke, adds a stunning sensual aspect."
4,Jesse James Women,"Produced by Lloyd Royal Sr. this is a great B movie from the 50s. If you like the old westerns you will love Jesse's Women. This action western has multiple plotts and a couple of nice twists not to memtion some beautiful female co-stars.If you are a 50s Western Fan, Jesse James' Women is for you."
4,word of advice,"works great, word of advice warm the pan up first before you put in the batter so it doesn't stick."
3,Nice But???,"This is a great little pan and lives up to the claims of being non stick. I did not have a bit of trouble with sticking. However, the Cactus shapes are very small and you need to use a small spoon to fill the designs. They are also very thin and will not hold much batter. Cornbread easily turns right out of the pan without sticking but they are so thin that you need to be extra careful not to break them. They are as cute as can be! Must admit that! Also, unless you can divide up a cornbread mix, figure on wasting about half of it unless you bake it in something else. By the time the first batch was done, my batter was to thick to get spooned & spread evenly into cactus shapes. Tried adding more liquid but just did not turn out right. This pan was a Great idea but if they would make the cavities deeper so bread wasn't so thin, it would be a perfect pan!"
2,"Bakes well, but hard to clean","Even though the pan is pre-seasoned and using baking spray, cornbread frequently sticks, resulting in a non-cactus shaped lump of food. Then it is difficult to clean the small crevices. Not recommended."
3,wanted to love it,"i bought this movie on faith.... im a big chinese cinema fan...unfortunately, though it may be the best in show in hong kong, it will leave western audiences laughing a bit. hard to suspend your disbelief for too long... story turns out to be much like HERO...its worthwhile to see, just to know it, there are some rewarding sequences... but just don't expect it to measure up to a big budget Hollywood production. its got too much of an amateurish feel for modern american audiences.Bluray quality itself is great. sounds great too.just manage your expectations."
1,No sound!,"I tried watching this today, no sound! No matter what settings I used I couldn't get any audio. I made sure I had the most up to date software on my player and still nothing. Every other disc I have plays fine, whether it be DVD, CD, Blu Ray etc.How disappointing... back to Amazon it goes I guess."
3,lot of scientific nonsense,"white phosphorus was by no means known during Wu Zetian's rule, since this is a discovery of 17th century....approx. 1,000 years later. Otherwise, it is a nice movie"
1,Judge Dee and the Phantom Flame.,The story line was very hard to follow because we had to watch the film reading subtitles - we could not get it to be in spoken English. The special effects were entertaining.
2,Good movie; Questionable DVD,"The DVD I was sent is an obvious bootleg with blurry artwork, an insert that doesn't fit into the case, and a weird cardboard case surrounding it. The disc was loose upon receipt, and the case was cracked. Picture quality wasn't up to snuff. The movie looked interesting but I couldn't finish watching it. I have a 60 inch TV and I guess I've been spoiled by good DVD releases recently."
4,Good book for those who need a little help!,This book is really good for those of us who don't always want to spend so much time trying to figure out what the new expansion pack brings into the game. You can just read the book and it will tell you what's new and how to best use certain things.
2,"Ok, but not great",I hoped for more information about the game in general and less images of new products or objects from the game. There were not enough tricks and tricks included to make it worth the price.
2,Given the hype-,"Given all the hype that has been sounded off about this book, I guess my expectations were far too high. I expected something that would make me throw away my Snyder book for the pictures, stop constantly using my Huxford for the information and become enraptured with this one... sorry folks. I found the ""one item to a page"" thing a little too overdone and self important. Really, MORE information on LESS pages at a LOWER cost would have been much preferred. At 39.95, it is unlikely that I will buy the next (inevitible) edition...- I mean, just how many photos of a single item, followed by a line drawing of the same item, do you need to see?... Huxfords have always kept prices at around $20 per each edition update.... at $40 I would rather buy a piece of Fiesta than (a second edition of) this book. If you can, buy it used or borrow it."
1,"Well, I guess it worked properly a few times...","This is a decent printer as far as quality goes, but it's way too fussy.Took me quite alot of trouble shooting to get the drivers installed, hooked up, and printing properly. When I say ""quite alot"" I mean several attempts over several days. Finally I got it working, and it worked well for about a week. But then another week when by where I didn't print anything, and when I finally went back to print something, it had stopped communicating with my computer again. I had to do the trouble shooting all over - VERY FRUSTRATING! I thought I was getting a great deal, but I feel like I got a lemon."
5,"ALL IS WELL, THANK YOU SO MUCH!","Killer underground ROCK 'N' ROLL bands presented by Sal from Electric Frankenstein. unfortunately, you do not hear any of them on radio stations."
2,Good camera but old design. There are better choices.,"I bought one for myself and my sister about 5 years ago...It takes nice pictures but the details aren't the sharpest.The camera is kind of big and bulky. Check out the newer cameras, they are much smaller and lighter. Smaller and lighter means you will take the camera with you more often and take more pictures.I wasn't thrilled about the reliability. Both cameras had to be repaired as soon as the warranty expired (2 years). Both cameras had the flash go bad which cost $90 each to fix.Then the door switch went bad on one making it totally useless. This time the repair would cost $100. I decided to buy a Canon instead.If you choose this camera, ask yourself if it is worth the price to have a camera that will last only 2 years.I strongly recommend you check out the newest models. For a little more money, you get a modern system with better features, smaller size, and hopefully better reliability."
1,Poor / No Customer Service,"I bought this camera at a reputable store as a close-out item. It had all the features I was looking for and then some. The pictures were very good. However, after about two months, the camera just quit working. All the lights were saying go, but push the button and ... nothing. That's when I found out that none of the usual camera equipment places will service Samsung. I was told it would cost more to send it to be repaired than what I paid for the camera. I was completely dissatisfied with the customer support for this product. I won't buy Samsung again."
5,Fan for the best pictures,I bought my first camera almost three years ago.I took more than 500 pictures and I never had a problem at all. I've only changed the battery once. I recommend this product to everyone. That's the great combination between a perfect product and best price.
2,Worked for a while,"Good pictures and features, BUT..after 15 months the zoom broke.So now I have a lot of pictures without heads. Time to buy another.Might buy it at $50...You'll get a year out of it."
1,Extremely disappointed,"This purchase sounded like a great deal. Unfortunately, it was a disaster. My wife and I bought it for my mother since she was about to take a trip to Ireland. When she got there, she tried to use the camera, but it broke the first day. The shutter would only open half way, and would not take any pictures. It left her stranded on a once in a lifetime vacation without a camera. It was very disappointing!"
1,Dissappointed in Texas,"I have had this camera for about 3 years and am very dissapointed with it. After taking pictures on a trip, that can't be reshot, I learned there was a short in the flash system. None of my indoor pictures turned out. I took it in for repair and learned it had to go back to the company. Four months and $87.00 later I got my camera back. It worked for less than a year and did the same thing. Needless to say I didn't spend any more money on it. Meanwhile I lost some irreplaceable pictures once again. I will never buy Samsung again!"
4,great camera,"My 14 year old son just bought this camera. We used it on our vacation for the first time. The picture quality is great and the features are fantastic. It takes a little learning but it is really a nice camera, and you sure can't beat the price for all the features. I am going to buy another one for me now."
1,This camera was not a good choice!,I was looking for a camera so that i could take pictures during my once in a lifetime class feild trip at Washington D.C. I thought this camera sounded like a good idea so i purchased it. When i got the camera everything orked good so when i took it on my trip i took three rolls of file like the were nothing. When i got them back from being developed only 2 pictures had turned out!! I was so depressed to find out the the battery had run low and without a warning! I warn you if you are an amature at pictures dont buy this camerea!
5,Best SUB for Bass lovers looking to go Death!!! LOL!!!,"This jl audio is the best sub I have ever owned and I have ever herd. I have had a few systems in my day but never something as loud as this one the bass hits so hard and is crisp and clear with any volume you put it on every time. But you have to have the right set up on this I have this in a ported box , I have the jl audio 1000/1v2 amp and it sound great. At the moment I have the factory deck ans the factory door speakers but the sub still sound great I have just purchased a new head deck and I have new door and back panel speakers have not got them installed yet but will be very soon I willl update when I do and let you now if it makes a differenes in sound but I will say that if you looking for a good speaker you will not regret buying this one I now I don't regret it I will buy it again If I had too but I give 10stars no joke recomend to any one out there that's wants a message will there driven"
3,soso earbuds,"The V-Moda is an excellent choice for earphones, if you don't mind the left earbud going out after the 4th month. I've purchased three so far and everyone of them went out around the fourth month. Needless to say I've learned my lesson."
5,Fun Album,A friend of mine saw them live at a bar gig and he thought they were great. Knowing me very well he decided to make me a copy thinking that I would like it. And of course I did. I can't belive they aren't all over the radio yet. My favorite song on the Album is TRY.
5,These guys are great. . .,"This is a terrific debut CD from a phenomenal band! I've been following this band for a few years now, and I'm very impressed with their talent."
2,"Beautiful fragrance, if you can smell it","Oh, my hopes for this candle were so high! I use the perfume and body glow, both of which are great, so I wanted to try the candle. And it is very pretty, almost zenlike it its simple white candle in a straight clear glass. It burns just fine, no prob there. It's just that you can't smell it! It's like any other plain candle. If you stick your nose close and really inhale, you may catch a whiff of the Kai.For its name and price, I expected more. I hoped it would effuse out at least a few feet like my favorite candles do. So, for the money, you can do much much better. If you need the Kai scent in your air, maybe use the body glow as an aromatherapy spray!"
2,"For the price you pay, it might not be worthwhile","This book provides a basic understanding and overview of logistics. If you are looking for something more advance and probably sophisticated, the 320 pages are unlikely to satisfy your needs."
2,"This seems like a nice adapter, but...","This adapter does not work with Windows Me. Although it appears to have all the features you want at a really nice price, the D-link card is not a good value. In comparison to a premium card, such as Xircom or 3Com, the D-Link card uses 5 volts instead of 3.3 volts, which drains a portable PC's battery much faster. Also, the D-Link card does not have cell phone hookups or a global modem, which limits its use even further. Finally, the company's web site has sparse technical data and the phone technical support department operates on a 'call-back' system that very rarely returns calls."
4,"It's like getting a piece of cake, and eating it too!","I liked pretty much all aspects of the album. The composition is so tight. It's an intelligent blend of alt rock, pop, and jazz. The lyrics especially, it's like they tell you a story and you're able to feel what they're feeling and get a glimpse of what they see."
3,"Good tunes, bad lyrics","I attended a coppermine show while in NYC... and I gotta say, the music was good, the guys were hot ;-), but the person who wrote the lyrics for their music? they should be [kicked]... sounding like every other random emo kid running around singing kumbyah (sp?) on some acoustic guitar... kinda hope no one saw me standing at the show..."
4,Number Cookie Cutters are #1!,"The kids had a blast with them! Very easy to use, but somewhat smaller than I expected."
4,I like hearing it,"I don't know what some of these other people are on, this is a great album to listen to. Yes it's a covers album but they're done well and it rocks hard all the way through. Especially Space Station No. 5, Don't believe a word and Live Wire. Andy Taylor decided to do it only after the band that were originally supposed to do it backed out. Here's the tracks on it.Don't believe a word - Thin LizzyStone Cold Sober - Rod StewartFeel like making love - Bad CompanyLola - The KinksSpace Station No. 5 - MontroseSympathy for the devil - Rolling StonesMustang Sally - ?Violence - Mott The HoopleCocaine - Eric ClaptonLive Wire - AC/DCWorth getting if you can find it."
2,"Not so dangerous, really","This is where Andy Taylor really went off the rails. The drink/drugs excess of the 80's must have had a significant effect because this is nowhere near the quality of his ""Thunder"" solo album, which underperformed vs. his early solo singles, which were a far cry from his energetic performances with Power Station. Nice to see him doing better back with Duran Duran, though. Get his other projects, but leave this one alone."
1,What are you doin???,Andy had a great album with Thunder. Then this. This is an album or rock remakes. They all sound the same. I mean every track!!!! It sounds as he only change lyrics. I can not explain how awfull this is.I was so excited to get this and so happy to sell it. I ma a huge Duran Duran fan but this one is best left dead.
4,A must have for Aikido students,"All in all this is a great book and, as I stated in the title, it is a must have for aikido students. However, in my personal opinion, it could have been written in half of the pages. Lecturing about the ""obvious"" connections between molecular biology-quantum physics-Aikido-cosmology-planet management sounds ... well, actually, it does NOT sound to tell you the truth. On the other hand, lecturing about the real meaning of budo is very good. Many concepts here explained are deep. Although it is not a technical manual, the notes about the spirit behind some basic techniques are really interesting."
1,Don't waste your money,"Do you like full page drawings that look like they were done by a child and have no significance? This book has plenty of them. How about pages of photographs that are not only uninteresting but don't appear to be demonstrating anything at all? Got ya covered. How about endless boring drivel? Cover to cover. Atoms spin around, planets spin around, your technique spins around, therefore aikido is in harmony with nature, zzzzzzzz. Get 'Ki in Daily Life' instead."
3,Not quite,"I bought this book after reading Vogue's review of it. I wish I would've realized the book's author was a regular contributor; it would've given me a better perspective of the review.I was quite disappointed & often aggravated while reading this book. Each sentence had multiple parenthetical phrases, making reading choppy and hard to follow. I didn't like any of the minor characters except Caroline, and didn't like the direction the plot took at all. I was intrigued by the main affair, but it got little attention in the book."
1,Pretentious drivel,"I have read three books by Jean Hanff Korelitz, including The White Rose. I have found them all to be pretentious, with flat characters and unrealistic dialogue. For an example of what I'm talking about, read the scene in The White Rose when Marian, Oliver, Marshall, and Caroline go to dinner together. Thank goodness I have gotten all of these books from the library, otherwise I would be pretty steamed about wasting my money."
1,When a story starts with...,"When a story starts with the world's most blandest sex scene you know it's not worth your time to read the rest of the book that is thick as a brick.The front flap of the hardcover promises a steamy, controversial, maybe intellectually stimulating story, but the real story is anything BUT.I threw it away and read ""Beowulf"" instead; in Old English!"
3,Mislabled,"This is a nice bar, but it is mislabled. Sunflower seeds, honey, flax seeds, sesame seeds, cocoa liquor, CRISP BROWN RICE(!), and lastly hemp seeds.I bought it because it was supposed to be a hemp bar.Again, good, but not what I thought I was getting. Nutiva should re-label this product."
5,Loved product!,"If you are trying to get in all the daily fiber and omeg 3, this bar is a great one. Love to keep it in the frig, to have it more as a bar. Since it's warm now, and it has so many seeds, it falls apart when out of the cold. But kept in the frig, I'm gonna experiment with a frozen one to take out for a snack; it keeps it flavor and shape. Love, I want to subscribe and save this bar!"
1,Too Much Bad Stuff and Not Enough Good Stuff,"This bar contains FAR too much fat, sugar and sodium while offering a meager 6 grams of protein. This doesn't even come close to a healthy bar. Just because it contains the buzz words organic, flax, and hemp does not make it a healthy choice. The sodium should be in the single digits and the sugar should not exceed 2-3 grams. To determine if it's healthy in terms of fat content, do the following: Divide the total number of calories by the total number of fat calories. If the answer is five or less, don't buy it: It contains too much fat."
5,TIRED OF WORKING TOO MUCH? READ THIS BOOK!,"This is a fantastic book about overwork and lack of leisure time in America, and how it affects us personally and as a society! John de Graaf has done an outstanding job as editor of this book! Get a copy for everyone workaholic you know! This is the book for the Take Back Your Time day movement that is growing by leaps and bounds! Say NO to overwork and get this book!"
4,Wow! This is good stuff! And it's biblical.,"This book was informative and inspiring, to say the least. I'm a single Christian male and I feel it is my role to ""take charge"" of the relationship in every respect. I've learned that when it comes to sex, it's usually best if she takes charge. I'm looking forward to living the principles in this book out in my future marrage. Men: Buy the book and remember all that it reveals. You will not regret it."
4,Quiet Places,"As a long time fan of Buffy Sainte-Marie, for some reason this was the one earlier album of hers that I never bought - so now, finally I have a copy - this CD is wonderful... if you're a fan, you might already have it but if not, there's some great stuff on here. Pure Buffy."
3,"Songs from many different countries, sung in French","Mireille has a beautiful voice. This CD contains a wide selection of songs from different countries and cultures, including a rendition of ""You are always on my mind"" (Tu n'a pas quitte mon coeur""). If you are looking for this international mix, all beautifully sung in French... Voila !. If you are looking for more original or traditional french songs, you may not be as satisfied."
2,small,this was way to small. I baugth the Ex large the add stated 14-16. It was way to small even my 17 year old daughter could not fit in it and she is a 10-12. so if you want one that fits buy BIG!!!!!!
3,Only for women with less than 10% body fat,"This swimsuit is unbelievably tight. I bought a 36 and I wear size 4-6 woman's clothing. I am not as lean as athlete swimmers, but we all have to start somewhere. This swimsuit is so tight that it is difficult to put on and looks like it was made for a 10 year old girl. I won't be caught dead wearing it. Unless you have less then 10% body fat, be prepared for a very unflattering fit."
2,"way small--even for ""real"" swimmers-especially if you have legs/hips","I am 5'2"" 120lbs (35"" hips). I ordered a 32 (I like my suits snug--I do triathlons/compete and understand that tight suits are good and don't have much of a chest to fit in there). I have never worn anything larger than a 34"" in a suit (and they were not particularly tight), except when I bought a 36 for early in my pregnancies. So, I cannot get the 32 suit past my mid-thighs--yes for my height I have muscular thighs and bigger hips probably--but I have to agree that this suit is sized 1-2 sizes smaller than normal, even for speedo.I will order the 36 and see how that goes."
2,MATERIAL IS THINNING IN LOWER BACK AREA,I LOVED IT WHEN I BOUGHT IT BUT NOW I NOTICED THAT THE AREA LOWER BACK TO BUM AREA IS THINNING. THE MATERIAL YOU CAN SEE YOUR HANDS THROUGH IT THAT'S HOW WORN LOOKING IT HAS BECOME.REGARDSNADIA GHANNY
4,Best suit I have owned.,I swim three times a week with a master's program. This suit fits perfect for me and added a glide that other suits in this price range have not. My only complaint is that the gold has faded after a couple of months.
4,Great swimsuit,"I wear a size 6 and I am 5'7"". I ordered this suit in a size 12 and it fit perfectly. It def. runs small, but when you do get the right size, it's a fantastic suit. I got the purple and black color, the speedo logo on the suit is dark purple and looks like it can be peeled or something..."
1,Speedo Race Lycra Suit,"I have bought many Speedo suits to swim laps and ordered this in my regular size. However, it is probably 2 sizes too small...so, if you plan to order one make sure you get a size or two bigger than you normally do."
2,Too small,"This is not a size 10. I have been buying swim suits regularly for 5 years, so I know. I like the style, it is just too small"
5,excelent!!!,This swimsuit is excelent!!! I am 34-26-40 so my size is 38. May be this helpfull to others costumers!
2,NOT FOR BUSTY LADIES!,"I understand what everyone is saying about needing to wear the suit tight and agree. I ordered a size up from the size I would normally wear I found it very tight but great for swimming laps.One thing that did NOT work for me was the fact that the sides are quite generously cut. If you look carefully at a couple of the photos you can see that the back is cut quite deep. I'm pretty busty, and I found that coming up for a break after a couple laps I was trying to quickly tuck things back in! I'm a 36D so I'm not even abnormally large but this suit is best for ladies with small busts. Will have to buy another suit now. :("
2,Okay...,"I didn't particularly care for this suit. The material felt cheap, and I didn't find the cut to be particularly flattering. I returned the suit."
4,"Great suit, sizing is insane","The suit itself is great, nice material, made well, I'm sure it will hold up well. That said, this is sized like a wedding dress. As in, take your street size and add 6. I had ordered a 28, which was my size based on the size chart, but it was Hobbit-sized when I got it. I couldn't even get it over my hips. I returned it for a 34, and that is still a bit snug (even more so than I'd prefer in a racing suit) but I think it will give a bit over time."
2,fits too small,"I ordered my regular bathing suit/speedo size, and this suit was way too tight on me, could hardly get it on. Had to send it back."
4,Very good as long as you get the right size,"The size of this swimming suit does run very small so be sure you order at least 2 sizes up. Once you get the right size, it really is an awesome swimming suit."
3,I've had better.,"I am 5'2"", 34B/27/38.5 and I ordered this in a size 36. It is a little hard to get on but it fits okay. Although the inner layer is somewhat snug the outer layer is somewhat loose and looks wrinkled. I know if I get a smaller size I won't be able to get it on so I think this will have to do. Other than that the red color is nice. I'm interested to know how well it will last."
4,works great,very good heavy gage seals well worth the money.i would recommend this to anyone looking for a good seal that works
2,Worked fine but rusted,"I used the star shaped cutter once to cut some carrot pieces for my toddler's lunch. I probably shouldn't have put it in the dishwasher, but it was completely covered in rust after one cycle. I had to throw it out. I bought some kotobuki cutters at the same time (next size up -- for cutting cucumbers...don't ask...we're desperate to get our kid to eat vegetables) and they are awesome. Have been through the dw multiple cycles no sign of rust and still quite sharp. FYI here are the kotobuki cutters I bought:Kotobuki Set of 6 Small Stainless Vegetable Cutters"
1,Tiny!,"Maybe I read the description wrong but the entire container is only 2"" the cutters are very tiny. If anyone has some suggestions on what I could use these for let me know."
1,Nothing like described,Add is very misleading and I would not purchase again. the pictures also make the product appear a lot larger than what the product really is I don't even see what you could make with these.
1,I bought this thing ...,"I'm just like everyone else who bought this product. I'm so genetically deviant I actually mistook this third world mistake for that great game I saw in an arcade called Dance Dance Revolution. Sure that game used a monitor, sound system, and a computer to make a fun game but I thought that this piece of plastic with lights on it could do the same. Then I opened it and suprise! It didn't even make sound! Not only that but instead of using an intelligent system like scrolling arrows in sync with music to show you your next dance steps it just blinked lights on the floor that while unnaturally staring down at you have to spastically smash with your feet. ..."
1,Extremely Dull Toy!!!,"This toy deserves no stars! It took longer to put the batteries in than it did for my daughters to tire of this toy. It played no music and only provided small lights for the girls to ""dance"" on. It was an extremely disappointing purchase!"
1,Get a Playstation and Dance Dance Revolution,Very uninspiring toy. For some real fun try Dance Dance Revolution for the Playstation and soon the PS2
2,DANCER MAKER REVEIW,I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR MY CHILDREN AGES 10 AND 11. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE LIKE THE ARCADE GAME THAT YOU DANCE TO THE BEAT. I WAS SO WRONG THE KIDS TRIED IT A COUPLE OF TIME. THEY SAID IT WAS NO FUN IT WAS IN THE GARAGE SELL THAT SUMMER
1,10 *s for the most misleading toy of 2002!,"Shame on everyone selling this alleged toy. A lump of coal in all of your stockings. How sad for any child to open this as a gift, only to be crushed when he or she realizes it's just a sham. How sad & foolish I felt when I received the call from my daughter, letting me know there was no music and the mat lights do not appear to follow any particular pattern for any type of music you might add, which you would have to do since the Dance Maker II does not include music. Just the random flashing light. I think those of us who fell for this alleged toy, should all receive a compensation of a gift certificate so we can attempt to make up for the let down these shams produced on Christmas morning."
2,fun the first time,"Hard to follow lights on pad while dancing. Thought that they were actually teaching certain dance steps not just random lighting. Hard for 5 year old, 8 year old had better concept."
1,I assumed too much,The information provided led me to think that this was the mat I needed to purchase with the Dance Dance Rev. DVD that I bought at the same time. So as a result I came away with two products that were useless relative to my plan. With no sound young children are not drawn to this product.
2,NOT A FAVORITE!,"I thought this would be great for my granddaughters but when we tried to use it they had some problems following the lights.They ended up just jumping on it which made me think I hadwasted my money. May be for some children this is a good buy, but for my household it was not! Sorry!"
2,Hard to use,"My nieces (3 and 5) had trouble using this game. The electronics seemed to work only intermittently. And, it was hard for them to follow the lights."
1,...,This is just a horrible piece of...stuff. I highly reccomend Konami's DDR MAX with a Dance Pad Revolution for the Playstation 2 or a Dance Dance Revolution : Konamix with a Dance Pad Revolution for the original Playstation or PS One.
2,If you have hard water forget it!,If you have hard water the life span of your ShowerTek Fog Free mirror is a few months. The unit leaks so much water that you'll get hard water stains all over the mirror and in the drain hole in back. You'll need to use CLR or other cleaning products designed to remove hard water to get the mirror cleaned up enough for you to be able to see it (as if fogging up isn't bad enough).If ShowerTek could redesign this so that the water circulates and goes back into the shower head instead of all over the mirror it would get 4 stars from me. Until then the next best solution is to buy a water softener...
2,Shower Tek Mirror Leaky and Squirty,"[[ASIN:B000184Z1G Adagio Marketing ShowerTek WV2 The Original Fog Free Shower Mirror]I have owned this in the past and not been satisfied, but when it was the only one available on Amazon with the features I wanted, I got it again and now it's worse than the first one I owned. The first one was only a pain to try to clean and the mirror is not receptive to normal cleaners and gets spotty. The new one has leaks at some of the connection spots and squirts out of the valve switch when the flow of water is opened to de-fog the mirror. So, great, I can shave but now either my walls, floors, or ceiling will be soaked, depending on how I position the bendable arm mount (which, again, also leaks depending on how you bend it)."
2,todys concept really bad seller,i waited 2 weekes for this product to only get an email saying my order has been cancelled. bad business ethics and i would never buy anything from them in the future nor will any of my friends of family
1,Disappointing,"I ordered this as a replacement for the more expensive model which was out of stock. I should have waited for the more expensive model. I installed the cheapo model WV2 yesterday and.. One valve can only be turned with pliers and the other valve turns easily, but the flow of water is unchanged. The arm is too short. It is impossible for me to get the mirror in the right position. As advertised, the mirror does not fog but you waste too much water in the process. I called the showerTec 800 number for help this morning, but alas no returned my call."
2,"Too short, valves are tricky","While the basic premise of this product is flawless, that is the warm water running down the back of the mirror does indeed keep it fog free, the goose neck from the diverter to the mirror is far too short.I am an average height man (5' 10"") and it is very difficult for me to get the mirror into a position that I can really use because the goose neck is just so short. I've checked and double checked that our shower head is installed at a typical height and the mirror is still too high to be useful.Also I have experienced the issue with the valves comming undone when you attempt to operate them, that is the valve to divert water to the mirror comes completely out of its seat if you twist just a little too far. Nothing starts the morning off right like a jet of hot water hitting the bathroom ceiling."
1,Flooded my bathroom,"When I turned on the water a valve above the mirror shot out. This flooded my bathroom. I replaced the valve and o-ring but then the same thing happened a second time. There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with the mirror, just bad design. Don't think my water pressure is unusually high."
1,FOG FREE NOT LEAK PROOF PLASTIC LEAK MACHINE,HAD ONE FOR 15 YEARS WORKED GREAT AND DIDN'T LEAK NOW THE NEW DESIGN AND IT IS A MIRRIOR THAT LEAKS ALLL OVER THE PLACE WHO EVERY MADE THE NEW THE DESIGN SHOULD BE FIRED DIDN'T THEY TRY IT BEFORE THEY DID AWAY WITH THE O-RINGS AND CHAGED THE DESIGN FOR THE WATER SUPPLY FOR THE MIRROS THAT LEAKS AND SPRAYS WATER ALL OVER THE SHOWER
2,Hope it never falls apart on you!,The product worked just as expected other than one huge problem. It's design is complete junk. My wife was cleaning the shower one day and knocked the mirror off where the bendable arm attaches to the valves. Since that day I have not been able to use it and that has been 3 to 4 months ago. I can't get it back together no matter how hard I try and I am a fairly strong guy. It's suppose to be able to snap right back together but I have spent hours on it and have had no luck.
2,"flimpsy plastic parts, poor razor holder",plastic parts are flimpsy and leatpoor design of razor holder; razor falls down to the floor
3,Showertek Mirror.,"The product does its main purpose quite well. I have yet to have any issues with the mirror fogging up. However, the main valve on the mirror really restricts flow to the showerhead. For me, this was a big issue so I actually removed the valve (w/ dremel tool) and now have unrestricted flow and the fogless mirror. So if you don't mind doing a little work on the product prior to use, this mirror will work fine."
2,flimsy,"inexpensive, but looks cheap, doesn't work that well; fell apart and I couldn't get it back together. (Replaced a stainless steel one -- now costs $100 -- that broke after 10 years.)"
1,Flimsy construction,"The fog free mirror works, but the flexible arm comes apart every time you adjust the mirror. Also leaks at connection with piping."
2,Too many weaknesses,"- The height is random, and usually too high. This is because it screws onto the shower line and where it stops is random: it may point up, down, or to the side.- It doesn't have any lights. If you have a well-lit shower you'll be ok. It's not for me.- It substantially reduces water flow.Overall, it's not a good enough product that I choose to use it. I uninstalled it after a few weeks."
3,OK for the price,"I bought two of these mirrors - one for each bathroom. While installing the first one the mirror broke in my husband's hands (the wand broke off the mount and could not be re-attached). The second one went on fine, but the workmanship definitely isn't of the highest quality. However, becaise of the price (this costs about a quarter of the Sharper Image version) I would buy a replacement one for my second bathroom. It does actualy remain fog free!"
2,for Younger readers,"I did not notice in any of the reviews that I read on this series of books prior to ordering them that it is written for children! I was shocked to see how ""thin"" the book was, and it's printed on larger prints. It is light hearted reading, it's O.K. but for such a ""smaller"" book it sure was not worth the money if one consider the other cat books, such as the ""Joe Grey"" series and the ""the cat who"" series, both of which I love, are much thicker, are sold for at least two dollars less! These ""thicker"" books have more story and blots. I will recommand this series to children but not for adult readers who are like me, used to reading books such as the Joe Grey series."
1,Total village,"This is totally village. I mean, really, why would Sting embarass himself by appearing with this total waste of atoms."
5,great movie,I rated this movie 5 stars. Great movie and story line. I would recommend this DVD to couples and singles alike
5,One of my husband's favorites.,"I have watched Genie Francis in General Hospital for many years - since before she and Luke got married...and yes, that makes me OLD...however, Genie Francis is a great actress and never seems to age at all. I have also seen her on The Young and Restless more recently. This is a great movie and we have seen number 2 ...Great movies."
5,What do you want here?,"This is one of my favorite movies, so again I purchased it for a Christmas gift to a good friend whom I think will love it as much as I do!"
1,What an Amazing disapointment!!,"I usually like movies that air on the Hallmark channel but, I found this one Amazingly BORING!!!!!!! WAY TOOOOOO SLOW & drawn out!"
4,Hallmark movie The Note,"If you like Hallmark movies you are going to love this one. It's a ""believe in miracles"" kind of movie. It doesn't have to be Christmas to enjoy The Note."
3,A long time coming,"I have been looking at this movie for years. Being a huge Genie Francis fan I wanted to get this movie for years but it was never available in Australia. Finally amazon came along and I had the opportunity of a life time, to purchase it. While I was a little disappointed in the acting the story was profound and two boxes of tissues later I realised I had enjoyed this little story. Well worth a look see."
4,Better the 2nd time watching it.,I got this and watched it a few months ago and didn't care for it. I watched it again a couple day's ago and seemed to like it better for some reason. It's kind of a slow movie. It's about a plane crash in which they all die in the ocean and a letter is found by a reporter who has been threatened to get fired. She uses the letter to increase her readers by trying to find out who left the letter to T. Good is come to all she inquires to when looking for T. T. ends out to be a blessing to the reporter as well. She also hooks up with a co-worker as well. Good movie for all to see. Family friendly.
4,The Note,I really enjoyed this movie because it is a good family view and the twist at the ending made it worth watching.
5,The Note,I was very pleased with THE NOTE. I bought it to put in our church library so the standards I measured it by were more stringent than a person might have for viewing in his own home. It met those standards.
1,Junk,"I hate these straps. I just bought a used Epi Custom with this strap and its a hunk of junk (strap). It does what it is supposed to, however since its cotton/nylon material it is slightly abrasive and will scuff up the finish on the guitar (not real bad but enough around the locks from the edge of the strap). The screw in locks are cheap looking (they do hold). The strap is to thin for my taste and feels as though its cutting into my shoulder and back. Since this came with the guitar it was the first thing I wanted to replace (after the crappy strings).I have used it on: Epiphone custom (for about 1 week till it was removed)Playing style: Rock, Classic, Metal, BluesGood: The locking on it is very well and it is cheap (cost)Bad: cheap design, cheap material, slightly abrasive material, uncomfortable, hideousOverall: 1 out of 5 starsAdditional Recommendations: Schaller strap locks, and a thick 2"" leather strap"
2,ok book,It's an ok book filled with very simple recipes.It is useful to you if you are brand new to cooking and does not have a lot of time to spend in the kitchen.Most of the meals taste ok and plain.
4,One man's signal is another man's noise,"An enigmatic and convoluted (snakelike, one might say) book, but eerily relevant and oneirogenic. Cyril Prothero and Polly Peptide join forces (and other things) when their respective lovers turn up missing. They encounter the mysterious Doctor Wu, Maxwell's Demon, Sophia, snake cults, voodoo, information theory, DNA, kinky sex, designer drugs, rock-and-roll, crytography, cyber-immortality, imperialism, gnosticism, bagism, fagism....all coiled up in this slithy tome like a slippery Joycean dragon. The cover art alone is worth the price of intromission. All I am saying is give this book a chance, because if you don't know by now, it ain't the meat it's the motion. (Hey, hey Paul, I can hear your heartbeat for a thousand miles!)"
3,Which world?,Sermonette' is off the 'Hold Me' album i believe - and is a great number.Vat 76 and Lover are great numbers also.The problem is there is not much other than 3 or 4 quality numbers and then it really tapers off - like a lot of albums do i suppose. I just expect more from such a great band.
5,Great Quality,I bought it to replace my noname CR-RW disks. And I use it in my car CD system. I rewrite it once or two a week. I hope to use it for a long time. But one thing I want to note is that the record speed is only 4x max on my DVD-ROM.
4,King Pin,This is easy to set up it does take out the wiggle. We had welded metal circle to the top for more stability. I don't think you had to but we did. Works great.
3,Not the best...,"I originally purchased this Red Dot sight for my Mosin Nagant 91/30 rifle. Unfortunately the sight does not hold zero on the rifle. I assume the recoil is too strong for this sight. It works fine with my wife's Ruger 22/45 .22LR pistol. So, be aware that guns with strong recoil will not work with this red dot sight. Otherwise a great looking sight."
2,Not great,"I mounted this on my Mosin 91/30 but the mount is too high so I couldn't get the point of aim to meet point of impact. There just wasn't enough adjustment. The adjustment knobs don't have good 'clicks' in that as you go through a few clicks, some are good positive clicks while others are mushy and you barely feel them to count. I found the dot didn't really move a great deal in some adjustments but moved a lot in others. I finally gave up and it is just sitting in my safe.Battery life is good and the optics are clear enough. I see a nice circular spot which is bright enough even in daylight. Some complain about an oval or jagged dot, but that is actually their eyes and not the dot itself."
3,Olde Booke but goode.,The book is dated and so are the experiments. Nevertheless for five bucks you can get a half dozen simple things to do with batteries and wires and bulbs so it's OK for the Mum or Dad who wants to encourage a little ones science interest. Good for a kid 5 to 8 years old I think.
5,very interesting book about Milton Erickson,"This is a very interesting book about the work of Milton Erickson. Great therapists like Jeffrey Zeig analyze deeply how Erickson worked in terms of attitudes and techniques.I don't understand the other review. Clearly, this book deserves 5 stars."
5,firehouse bookshelf,"The bookshelf really came in handy for my son's numerous dvds and books. We turned it to a basic entertainment center. His light weight 15"" tv futs perfectly on top. The only flaw with the shelf was when we put it together, the hidden door was missing a hinge. I called the same day and two days L8R not only did they send a new hinge, they semt another door. My four year old loves this shelf"
4,Firehous Bookcase a perfect addition,"This is a fantastic little bookcase; perfect for our son's cars, trains, and planes theme room. It could be a little bigger for tall books but overall it is a nice size and a great buy for the price."
5,Very good item!,"We bought this item for our children library. We are very pleased with it! Our children love it and it has enough space for many books, except that big size books might not always fit, but most books will. The colors are beautiful and fun...the size is perfect for any age! We would recommend it to anyone interested in buying a bookcase for their children!"
4,SO CUTE!,"LOVE IT! A little time consuming to put together but sturdy when finished. This could serve as a bookcase, dollhouse for boys or just a cute bedside table. Love that it isn't Made in China but Indonesia. Reasonable shipping costs given the weight."
4,very good,when i first got this book i was definitely unsure of how they would portray the zombie wars. but i foumd that according to those of us who are very true to our zombies... it definitely ledt me sarisfied.
4,Dead on,Zombie fiction at its finest. These are some of the best stories I've read on the genre in a while. Great stories by some very fine writers.
3,hmmm,"You know I read some pretty good zombie books, so if you are going to capture me in a short story you need to really go at it in creating the story, the characters, and the end... this is all over the place. Some of these are good, most are just - hmmmmm..."
3,Entertaining read.,"I really enjoy an anthology that shows some variety. This anthology wasn't too heavy - plenty of dark humor mixed in with more serious stories. The contributors were somewhat uneven. Some were excellent, where others appeared to have been written by a 13 year-old (werewolves fighting zombies). I thoroughly enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone looking for a quick, entertaining read"
5,BEST OF C-BO,"STR8 FIRE-THIS ALBUM IS HEATED WITH TRUE SAC-TOWN,KILLAFORNIA WEST COAST GANGSTER GAME...BO-LOCC THA PSYCHO SERVIN IT TO YA!!!SLAM EVERY ONE OF THESE CUTZ ALL THE WAY THROUGH- THIS ARTIST WILL TRULY LET YOU KNOW WHAT WEST COAST GANGSTA LIFE IS LIKE..."
3,thought provoking,"As a former New Englander, there is so much here that culturally defines characteristics and attitudes that stay in the East. I was brought back into a world I left 30 years ago and the memories although not specifically mine, were vivid."
1,Memoirs should be memorable,I read this book hoping that Johm Cheever's daughter might possess a bit of his genius. Not so. This book is humdrum.
2,Beware of the label,"When I read the title of this supplement designed to lower cholesterol, it says red yeast rice, which in English seems that it is made of a variety of rice called ""red yeast."" This stuff is made of a FUNGUS called RED YEAST that grows on rice and must be carefully prepared because it is often accompanied by a toxic byproduct. If YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO MOLDS THIS MAY CAUSE A REACTION."
2,These pills almost killed me,"I can't talk about the effectiveness of this product because I did not get my cholesterol checked before and after using these pills. These pills are huge, and by huge I mean gigantic and impossible to swallow. I was alone at my gym locker room where I used to take this pill before my workout and the pill got stuck in my throat. I really though I was going to die because I drank more water and the pill would not move and it was hurting a lot. After making some involuntary weird noises I threw up and the pill came out. It was the most awful experience of my life. I usually do not have problems swallowing big pills, but this is out of the ordinary. Additionally they are not gel capsules, which makes it even more difficult."
1,I got them stuck in my throat several times,"As another reviewer has said (Patches), I have had the same experience as they did and gotten the big tab stuck in my throat on several occasions. Finally learned my lesson and went with the v-caps. Please do yourself a favor and buy the soft gels or v-caps!"
3,Red yeast rice,I ordered the wrong one. I thought I was ordering the one I orderede before. I prefer it the one before.
1,Difficult to put on,"I could not put the covers on at our shore ststion as it's too tight of a fit and has no front lip to hold it in place, therefore I had to return them. It may be fine for trailoring but not for lift."
2,NOT crimp type pins.,These are NOT crimp type pins. They are flag type and must be soldered if you wish a strong connection. The photo is deceptive as it is not clear enough to tell they are not crimp type.
3,"Well made, but fades quickly.","This cover seems pretty heavy-duty and it's well made, but it did fade in direct sunlight almost immediately. Kind of a bummer because the color was nice."
2,Not worth it,"As a previous review indicates: this book is only translations. That does not make it ""subordinate"" to Freeman's ""Commentary."" Think about it: since when are primary texts subordinate to commentaries?As a translation of pre-Socratic fragments it is a complete collection and definitely handy to have. On the other hand, if you plan to use it to study the pre-Socratics, forget it. The translations are terrible, often adding entire sentences to the original Greek, presumably to make it ""clearer."" Translations should be as minimal as possible, particularly when dealing with texts as ambiguous as pre-Socratic fragments. So if you want to do serious work, stay away from this book."
4,"Gradual, Noticeable Results","Not an instant cure-all, but this product has lightened age spots on my upper cheek in the last couple of months. (Can't speak for acne/scars, since that wasn't my target area.) I apply sparingly once every two or three days, to avoid any irritation. A little goes a long way. So far, so good."
3,Not for me:(,"I have some pretty decent marks on my skin from acne and melasma, and this product definitely lightened them up. However, my acne prone skin wasn't too fond of this product and I ended up breaking out more. I have such sensitive skin and unfortunately this wasn't for me."
5,Great Product,"This is a great lightening gel - especially for the price and when compared with other lightening products that cost 3 - 4 times more. I use this at night, under my regular creme and it helps to even and lighten my skin. I've had acne issues my whole life, so this helps to reduce the skin discoloration and small scars. It absorbs in quickly and doesn't leave any sticky residue like some gels can. The pump bottle isn't fancy, but the product really works and is a great value."
3,First Impression,"My impression upon first reading this work is that the material could be differently, and perhaps better, translated."
3,Very basic,"This really boils down to just a basic dictionary. Missing are the highly technical terms you'd find in Dorland's or Stedman's. Fine for lower level work, but for me, as a medical translator, it nearly always fails to produce. Nevertheless, the terms see accurate enough."
1,Not worth buying,"It lacks definitions for basic medical terms such as stroke for instance, and the Portuguese translations are very poor. Not worth purchasing."
2,NOT AN ADEQUATE TEACHING SUPPLEMENT.,"Medical Dictionary/Diccionario de Medicina is presented in a format that is easy to use. It has many terms that are ""commonly"" used in a basic, beginning level study program. However, many words and definitions were not available. If you are relatively fluent in Portuguese or Spanish this book might be an asset to your teaching program. If you are less than fluent in either of these two languages this book is sadly inadequate. I was very disappointed and felt it was not worth the money spent and I bought it used."
1,Edition Number not specified and Long Shipping,"I hated this purchase because it proved to be the wrong edition. I searched ""6th edition"" and this book came up. Assuming that it was the right edition, I purchased it on Dec. 23, 2009. Starting classes on January 6, 2010, I still did not have this text. I emailed the seller and they replied with the date that they shipped it, but replied that they had no tracking number and that it would be there by Jan. 19th. I received the book a week later only to find that it was the wrong edition even though I had searched for 6th edition. I ended up having to buy the text from a University bookstore for an astronomical price. I will not trust this seller again seeing as though they could not even provide me with a tracking number."
3,Space is the place...for action,Omega Boost - Circa 1999GOOD:- Overall fun game to play- Fast and furious gameplayBAD:- Graphics might look a little dated- Controls can be a little tough- Game gets pretty is tough on higher levels- Short game with no real unlockables or bonusIF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:- A 3D shooter which plays like a fast and furious version of Panzer Dragoon- Simplistic arcade style presentationGAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- Panzer Dragoon- Colony Wars- Zone of EndersADDITIONAL NOTES:- Static X (the 90's rock band) did some of the soundtrack I believe
3,"Great game, but not much replay value.","Omega Boost is an okay game. The graphics are probably the best on PlayStation, rivaling Final Fantasy VII. The music is cool at the beginning, but later okay. The gameplay is not too bad, but could be worse. After you beat it , there is not much left after."
3,Dependency on IPX/SPX-compatible protocol made me return it,"In some situations, this product might well have great utility. It's a great way to hook up a portable computer temporarily to a network, or to hook up a desktop whose PCI slots are already occupied. But I found that it forced me to use the IPX/SPX-compatible protocol, and this protocol wasn't supported by my ISP. So I either had to set all the other computers on my network to reconize that protocol, or get a different LAN converter. Since adding unused protocols typically slows down the operation of the machines not using that protocol, I chose another USB Lan connector.Of course, my experience in no way implies that you'll have difficulties. It's a reasonably priced product and I'm sure it works well. But check that your connection to the larger internet can deal with the IPX/SPX protocol, and that you won't have to add useless protocols to the other computers on your network just to get the one using this product to work."
4,Soothing and Melodic,Anyone looking to expand their musical tastes and calm the savage beast inside then this is mustard - let the flute caress your mind and take you to places where you only visit in sleep...ok that's a bit deep but it does wash over you - not the best Japanese music ever but very very cool. Recommended stress buster!
5,These are so cute!,"I've wanted these for a long time, and finally bought them. I'm so glad I did. The quality is excellent, and they're a perfect size for ice cream, yogurt, or other light snack. Besides that, they're fun to use - small pleasures."
3,Ice Cream Raffle Prize,I purchased these bowls along with some other ice cream type products from Amazon to make a raffle basket for our little league opening day. Our team raffle basket was a hit and these colorful bowls helped sell tickets for the raffle.
2,"too small, sadly","What a great idea. I am a typography teacher. I had delusions of grandeur thinking I was actually going to make letter cookies. I knew when I saw them, once out of the tin, they weren't going back in. No big deal, there. The dough for these would need to be very tough to get them out. Doesn't work with sugar cookie dough. Rats. And, way too small. I don't have the kind of time it would take to work with these. I would LOVE to find larger ones. I know there is a market. I have seen people asking for them all over the internet.Great concept, but the actual product doesn't work."
1,The tin will RUST!!!!,"I used them once and the begin rusting at the seems. They are cheap and the letter are too small to use for anything. Next time, I'm buying plastic and a larger size."
2,Too small to cut anything,These cookie cutters are adorable. Sadly they are too narrow to cut anything. We were unable to cut cookies or even hard cheese. My son was very disappointed.
2,tiny tiny 1 inch high by 3/4 inch wide,Gosh I really didn't expect them to be this small. 1 inch high by 3.4inch wide. I'm going to be making Q cookies for days for the kindergarten class. I must have missed the measurements when I went to order these. Oh well fun for the children to make their name.
3,Smaller than expected,Sturdy cookie cutters but they are a lot smaller than I expected. The image shown is true to size! Makes it hard to cut anything remotely sticky cause it just gets stuck in the cutter.
2,Tiny and Difficult to put away,"These are cute cutters & I feel were an impulse buy on my part. They are really hard to work with!These are SUPER TINY! I had so much trouble cutting/getting the shape out of the cutter without ruining the letter.Then, after you are done and washed them all - getting them to fit back into the tin they came in takes forever. I gave up and just got a Ziploc bag."
2,puzzle,"this turned out to be a bit smaller than expected, but nicely made. It is a puzzle (I like puzzles though) to get them back in the tin if you take them out."
3,interesting.,they are great cookie cutters but more for fondoant uses. tried to make jigglers didnt work tried cookies. not bad but they burned easily due to how small they are.
3,Why bother?,This is a collection of numbers taken from several other albums.So why bother making it ?
4,"Not perfect, not bad for the money","One minor complaint: light diffuses between adjacent LEDs behind the front panel membrane, especially when viewed at an angle. Reading the LEDs is difficult if the switch is on the floor for example. Otherwise, pretty cool."
5,Data Switch,"I run both a desk top PC and an older Laptop off my DSL line . Hard wired, no Wifi. Both have been running well up to a month ago when the PC started slowing down considerably. I tried reseating all cables and rebooting, but only removing the data switch helped. So I was happy to find this used D-Link Switch at Amazon for a great price. I was concerned at first if it would even work, but 3 days later it was delivered - and installing took just a minute. Works perfectly now, both units have blazing speed, and I feel like a genius for figuring it out."
3,I will have to return this for the third time soon...,"The very first one of these I got was the new fan-less design. It worked great for about a year but then it fried one of its ports AND took out my 3Com network card at the same time. :-(I called and D-Link replaced the switch for free (but of course wouldn't even send me one of their 10/100 cards to replace the 3Com), but the replacement I got is one of the older ""with fan"" units.The problem? The fan is now making a horrible noise/rattle but has not actually failed as of yet, so I doubt D-Link would replace it again until the fan actually died...Bottom line - great product, reliability is a bit suspect, though, and I'm a bit unhappy they replaced my newer unit with a refurbed ""Rev. A"" unit..."
5,Nothing bad to say about it...,This device arrived as a replacement for my 10bT hub. The process of actually replacing it was just as easy. I'm now getting the performance that I was seeking for my network...and at a great price!
3,"Good workout, but false advertising","I don't have much to say as John Paul L. Finan said it very well. I wish there was a timer and a counter. It's a cheap DVD with a good, fast paced, workout. In general, you will be happy.I do have a HUGE complaint though. The DVD very prominently advertises, ""no equipment needed"", but as soon as you get to the first circuit, it requires a bench to elevate your feet for the WHOLE circuit! Now, I know what you're thinking, just use something else...the problem is, I don't have anything else to use. My chairs are bar height, there is no couch in the room, etc., and they act like everyone just has a bench laying around. They don't even suggest an alternative.Totally false advertising.I'm sure I will get some criticism for this, but bottom line to me, ""no equipment needed"" means NO equipment needed."
3,"Good workout, be careful.","I like the fast pace and intensity. I'm 45 and recovering from a chronic infection so this is challenging for me. It offers a good alternative on days when it is difficult going to the gym to lift weights. However, I was injured doing one of the exercises.The emphasis on pushups--about 4-5 types--is a big issue. It puts a lot of strain on the shoulders. I hurt my right should the first day of doing this doing the shoulder raise pushups. It popped. I would give it five stars apart from this. I continue using the tapes but do rehab exercises during the push-up segments.I like the lower body and ""core"" exercises. Some put a bit much pressure on the lower back--not sure Stuart McGill would approve--but no issues so far with the moves.So 5 stars for intensity, leg, back, and abs. 1 star for shoulders and pushups."
5,Dogs rock!,"I purchased this book for my goddaughter Rylee after her enthusiastic response when I read it to her (having checked it out from the library originally.) She loves dogs, so I thought she'd enjoy it...but her response was so sweet-she kneeled in my lap,patted my cheeks, and kissed me! She is learning the names of different breeds and it's fun for her to find the dachsund, since she has one. I also recommend Cats! Cats! Cats! by the same author."
4,"great hooks, songs you can play over and over again","After years of metamorphosis, i.e. different musicians, different band names, Doug Hammond has matured. Very melodic and soothing to the soul. The type of music that plays over and over again in your head until you rush to the CD player so you can listen to the layers of beatle/oasis/verve/u2/smith's type sounds - yet, it is the original haunting melodies that will claim you!"
1,SHAM - DO NOT BUY - LOOK HIM UP,"I don't believe that OVERMAN2000 can legitimately have any of these ""5star"" reviews. There has to be something wrong with that. I ordered a box set DVD for a gift. Shame on me for not opening them. They were the wrong DVDs packaged in the box. I have had no response from seller nor do I expect I will. I will never buy from this seller again. He has already been removed from EBAY. When will Amazon do the same??? The BBB has him listed at a C+. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!"
3,Misses Injury Topics,"Unfortunately, the author neglects the health psychology of safety behaviors and behavioral modification strategies for changing injury risks. This is particularly disappointing since injuries are the leading cause of death from age 1-44 and dominate morbidity and mortality for young adults, the readers and benefactors of the courses this book is designed to accompany."
2,a mixed bag...,"this fairly long winded medievel historical has both good and bad points. Interesting and educating info on historical England and France, and some of the customs therein. This book was fairly good, IMO, up through about two thirds-the last third drags a bit much. My main problem was the inept, flighty, weak willed heroine, who seems to have many moments where she's just TSTL-LOL! I guess I'm spoiled for most new romance writers heroines who are stronger and smarter than this one.My suggestion would be to only get into this one if you have nothing else to read or can get it really cheap:)"
3,Triunfo del Amor,"I've been wanting to see this for the longest. The show was alright, but the editing was terrible. It was very choppy; the scenes did not match up. I rather watch the entire series on Televisa channel. Hopefully, it will come on again."
3,El Triufo Del Amor,This Novela Is Nice & Everything I Love It But Theirs Nothing Like Watching It On Tv It Skips Way To Many Events Which Kind Of Sucks Becuase Then Now How You Can You Understand The Novela Better But Over All Its Nice I Just Recently Bought It ! I Just Wish That It Didn't Skip A Lot >.< But Yeah !
2,Very awful editing....,"I had been waiting for a long time to receive this novela, but it has been a great disappointment. The whole story was awfully edited, all of the special parts and interesting parts of this soap opera have been removed. If I would have know this earlier I would have never bought this at all... very disappointed indeed!! :("
1,triunfo del amor,It was horrible. They cut the episodes so much that it didnt even give me a chance to fall in love with the characters. I saw this novela when it was on tv a while back so i know that it was good...its just that it was badly edited more like they took out most of it. :-(
3,"Liked it, but..","Loved this series! Its a must to watch and have.Excellent quality, vulome and everything.But unfortunately, it doesn't contain all the episodes or scenes and that made me disappointment."
1,"Started off good, but dragged mid way through....","I was so excited to watch this new retelling of this story because of William Levy. Sad to say his sexiness could not save this ""novela"". It started off promising, but got horribly boring towards the middle, and just never picked up momentum. All my cousins and aunts who also watched this ""novela"" agree. If you want to see a better version of this same story, pick up ""El Privilegio de Amar"" which is available on DVD and stars Adela Noriega, who is 100 times a better actress than the girl who plays the main girl. The caliber of actors is soooooo much better, and that story never lost my interest!For those looking for a shirtless William Levy, you will not find him here either. Pick up Sortilegio if you want to see more of his sexiness."
3,"Entertaining ""telenovela"" - horrible editing","This telenovela is about a very sweet lovestory and I really liked the show when I lived abroad. However, the editing is horrible, there should had been at least one more disk. Important parts are cut out, so that it seems things happens unnaturally fast, we miss important stories and details, some characters are almost cut out from show, and more than once you will ask yourself ""what happend now?"" It's really frustrating that it seems they just decided to cut out an entire episode or more here or there. Would like to see the show as it was shown on television."
5,Fantastic,I so enjoyed Triunfo del amor but wished there were more episodes. I watched all the episodes on Dailymotion but missed so much on the tapes because alot was left out. I do not speak Spanish so the 3 discs sent helped me so much to understand exactly what was going on. I only wished there were more discs. I would gladly pay for more content. I also bought Cuidado con el angel and enjoyed that immensely. DVDs were very clear and translation to English made it so enjoyable to watch. Thank you.
5,Tour de Force,"""Suck My Spock"" is jam-packed with excellent songs that cover all kinds of topics related to Star Trek. From ""Montalban"" and ""Shatner"" to ""Holosuite Woman"" and ""Deanna What's on My Mind?"" there's something here for everyone.The best thing about Warp 11 is that the band is actually good -- it's not *just* a Star Trek band, it's a *good* Star Trek band! Every song will make you want to get up and dance!Big ups to my local boys Warp 11! Check out Warp11.com for more info."
2,universal guide used for oster,it does not hold on well and slips off when using to cut thick hair. It restricts the blades cutting power.
1,Yawn.,"I bought this because it looked like it might be hilariously stupid. Unfortunately, it's merely boringly stupid. Once you have a good laugh at the starfish costumes, that's about it. During the movie I found myself critiquing the quality of the dubbing (which is quite good, actually) because there just isn't anything going on worth paying attention to.Overall, I'd say the quality of this movie is about the same as the quality of the reviews here. 'Color film wasn't perfected when this movie was made'? 'This is an early attempt at colorization'? Come on, people. It's simply a public domain movie and no one spent any effort beyond copying the first faded print they could find to DVD.I simply have to love Alpha Video's cover art. I should add another star because the cover is so spectacular, but the movie itself really is a stinker."
3,"great, really bad Japanese scifi","This is the kind of thing I would watch when I had time to waste as a kid: it has monsters (kind of waddling stars with an eye in the middle), quirky details (they choose Japan to communicate with earthlings), and a bigger theme (don't want to play the spoiler, but it isn't what you're led to think).The execution is laughably clunky - campy and yet not so bad that it spoils the concept. The acting is also mediocre, but passable. Recommended, even if it is not classic, for afficianados of good bad scifi."
3,Works fine but...,"...it's not the best way to go. If you want to download pics to your PC, you're better off owning a cheaper and more portable card reader, which just slips into any computer's USB port and accepts the memory card from the camera, using the PC's power to do the image transferring.I don't think this gadget makes sense unless you are planning on shooting while plugged into a wall socket or unless you are planning on running a slide show directly from your digicam to a TV/monitor."
5,"Sturdy, great value",This is a nice sturdy shelf and a great value. Best bang for your buck right here. Has the perfect combo of value and quality.
5,Great item/would buy another if i need one,"I had bought this pruduct to hold up my cable box and it looks great, it was easy for my husband to set up and is very sturdy, i would deff recommend"
5,nice shelf,This is a nice compact shelf. We purchased it to hold a small tv and Sat receiver in our exercise room. Installation is easy.
2,Misleading product description,"The product description says that it ""safely supports components weighing up to 100 pounds per shelf"" however when it arrived, the box stated the maximum weight for the shelf is 25 pounds. My receiver is 38 pounds, so I had to return the shelf."
5,exactly what we wanted,I came across this while looking for something else. It works perfectly for a small TV in the bedroom. My husband used stronger molly screws because that's just his paranoia. It would have been just fine with the supplied hardware.
5,LOVE IT,It just had a few scratches but played fine. I love her music.It was in great condition Thanks You alot.
5,classic,"This album is great.It was made during a time period when awol records c-bo,lunnasicc,pizzo where at there best.The production and the beats have that unique awol sound.This is a timeless sacramento album when the sac town was making the best music the west coast had to offer.A must have to any 90s era gangsta rap fan."
1,Buy the 'Roadrunner Best Of' instead.,"Malevolent Creation, in my opinion, is one of the best death metal bands of all time. What the reviewier bellow me said though pretty much hits the nail on the head about this cheap product. Roadrunner's 'Best of Malevolent Creation' is a must better choice. The quality is just much better."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!,"this cd was rushed to compete with Roadrunner's best of and ""Warkult"". Crash is trash and proves it on this sloppy compilation of great MC songs, but Crash Music didnt even bother to master it or level out the volume, so each song is a different loudness. thats not even the worst part...there are skips on about 5 songs on every single copy of this cd. AVOID."
3,very informative,"the book isn't bad....my only problem was that when I bought it, it said no writing and in the first 30 pages there's underlining and writing on the sides...I find it hard to read like that, but the book itself teaches a lot."
5,this book changed my health & life!,"Dr. Strand has known for 30 years what the rest of us are only now hearing in the mainstream media: obesity and it's many degenerative disease consequences can be prevented and reversed for most of us! In his friendly conversational way he describes how our bodies react to sugars and processed foods. Then he explains how to solve the problem--I use his book as my guide for shopping, or for reminding myself how to get back on track with my dietary lifestyle when I start to crave bad foods again. He is the original dr. oz, oprah and your favorite teacher all rolled into one!! I've shared this book with everyone I can. Thanks, Dr. Strand."
3,Healthy for Life,"The whole idea behind this book is wonderful and helpful. I will re-read it and use it as a reference book because this is a subject I really need help with. The only thing that was surprising, and it is an important observation, is that there were so many grammatical and spelling errors. This always gives me a negative response to a book, especially since the author is a doctor. Then I have the tendency to doubt his or her credentials. Maybe we are entering an age when grammar and spelling are not as important as they used to be."
5,IT WORKS!!!,"My doctor recommended this book to me. My doctor is not your typical doctor. He is really into health and fitness, not just medicine. I started eating differently about 3 months ago and I have already lost 15 pounds! This book is your tool to getting your life and health back. It really is a lifestyle change and re-learning how to eat all over again. I would recommend this book to anyone! Get it! You won't be sorry!"
3,Doctor 's recommendation,Helpful but somewhat difficult to change your lifestyle to follow but offers good guidlines to work into your life. Book received quickly and product was great quality
1,"Extremely poor product, do not buy","I had not expected such a bad quality camera from Logitech. Its picture quality is very poor, extremely grainy and dark. I was very dissapointed, my 6 year old webcam does a much better job. I will not recommend it for even the first timers."
1,Misleading description Logitech expects customer to pay for.,"I bought two of these cameras becuase the box shows a picture of the camera cliped to the edge of an LCD monitor. I wanted to clip it to my laptop. The side panel also lists a monitor stand as part of the specs.The package came with no such clip and when I contacted Logitech about it via e-mail, I was told I could buy one from them by calling their 800 number. Instead they'll be returned and I'll buy cameras from a vendor that delivers what they promise."
4,Web Cam Fun,"Enjoying my new web cam,particularly when I`m talking to friends via IM. Lots of fun. Satisfied with purchase transaction, Delivery was made in fair time, Purchase price was good.and item works well as stated No problems. Would do business again."
1,Stay Away from this Camera,"I thought I got a bargain for $25 but this camera is absolutely shocking. The picture is totally blurry. We are not talking about being pixelated, but a complete blur. I can't believe a company like logitech released such a poor product. I'm not sure what the hell went wrong the quality control on this one. STAY AWAY!"
3,the price is good but the picture not so good,well i bought this webcam because my other webcam quite workingon me one day [enough said] i like it because of the pricewas a great deal the only thing i do not like about this webcamis how to take photo's with it when you do not have it connectedto the usb port on the computer. No flash button to use and no hole to look through for taking photo's with it unless i'm wrong am i? it comes with drivers and software to use. And i find that the software to use you have to change you screen resolution in order for it to even run whats up with that come on a program that uses1024 x 768 instead of 800 x 600 i don't understand that all if you need a descent webcam i would suggest using good judgement. What i mean is look around on the internet before disiding on what your gonna buy first check out the specs etc
2,About mail in rebates,"I have subitted the rebate for this product in the month of Aug-06, till date Nov 2006, I have not received the rebates."
4,Good only if you get it below 10$,"This webcam looks ok for the price, I got it for $9.95 after MIR. The image quality is good in the day light, however under lights you get to see lot of grains with sunset red color image. If you want to use webcam daily and more so to impress someone special, then don't buy. Otherwise as I said no complaints for the price paid. You get an earphone and a mic that is bonus"
1,how can this not have a built in Microphone,It's Logitech...it should have a built in Microphone. instead there's a small head set. don't buy this. spend a little more for a built in microphone.
4,"Good price, Decent quality","This cam overall is good for my uses, it does not have the best resolution, however it has good resolution for it's price. overall it's a good buy"
1,video/image sucks!!!,"got the camera last week-end... installed fine on my desktop ( SONY VCG-RB34B P4 3Gz,1.5 gig RAM,WXP MCE) but I got shocked at how horrible the image quality is!!! Despite significant lighting, adjustment of the ""manual focus"", tweaking the preference for backlight and color compensation, etc... didn't improve the image. In addition, the streaming video is very choppy, with up to 2 second delay. Terrible product. Not worth a penny. Do not even get it even if they give it for free after rebate - not worth the stamps for your rebate!!!"
3,think before you buy,it is ok in daylight but very poor performance in low light conditions.......if planning to use at night then better to get a good one especially the Logitech Quick Cam Fusion which i got later and is the best one for me so far in the lowest of light conditions
3,Does the job.,"I think this camera was about as cheap as I could find. For my purposes (online spanish lessons), it does the job. The bottleneck is the internet connection, not the camera."
1,NOT for macs,wish someone had specified that before i bought it. oh well. hope this saves someone else some time.
3,Not that great,This item does not take a very good video and the sounds piece/microphone was not even in the box.
5,Perfect,Had to get this so the new screen door slider would work. Had a regular entry set before. Glad I found everything here. Now we can leave the door open and close the screen door without bugs getting in.
4,Universal - Maybe (Be Prepared to Make DIY adjustments),"After purchasing this door knob for our 1978 Starcraft Starmaster 7 popup camper, I quickly discovered that it wasn't going to fit the door for various reasons. The most important ""size difference"" was that the bolt and plate were larger than the broken one that was being replaced. So buyer beware - universal does not mean EVERY camper or RV with a door and door knob. That said, however, I was able to enlarge the opening on the metal edge of the door, and fashioned some tin/aluminum plates and was able to get this installed. It did take a lot of work, however.Once installed, it works very well and I thought that the product is a solid door knob and good value for the $. Hence the 4 star rating."
5,At Last,"I had a few of these tracks on reel-to-reel (taped off BBC radio) 40 years ago. To this 16 year old, Rendell & Carr were as fresh & exciting as anything coming out of the US, with the exception of Miles & Coltrane.Haven't heard this music for 25 years, but it still sounds great. I've played it almost every day this past month. The interplay between Rendell & Carr is just perfect. I had forgotten how tight the quintet played. Can't imagine why the music was never re-released before."
5,Newest technology - music adapter for your telephone,"On Hold..two words we tend to hate..but wait, now you won't be bored ever again..This new product makes it as enjoyable as possible..No extra power needed, clear, quality music makes this product a must have..Be the first on your block, or in your family to buy this music adapter."
4,The return of ARSENIK,"This is Arsenik's second album, and they're more hardcore rap on this one. My favorite tracks on this one are ""POISON"", ""La Rue de la Haine"", and ""Rester Vivant.""I enjoyed their first album, ""Quelques Gouttes Suffisent"" better than this one. The flow and beats are much more smoother.This is a good album to keep in your French rap collection, but I would recommend Arsenik's first album over this one."
4,wish there is more,I work in a gas trading software company and this is a good book to read to learn the business. Just wish there is more detail info on the different types of trades out there.
4,Great intro book,"This is a great place to start. The first half of the book describes the natural Gas business, the second half was just a refresher on basic derivative structures."
2,Way too technical,"Written for the expert. I was hoping for a discussion of strategies, but this is about the mechanics of trading ."
2,Good for beginners bad for developers,This book is well written and is a good read for thos people who have very little experience with any version of Notes. However it is a big big let down for developers. It has a small amount of application dev information with no mention of java agents or any other professional level information about creating Lotus Notes applications.
1,TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT,"I thought Tarzan was going to be the best game in the world, but actually it's a BIG WASTE OF MONEY. When you can't pass a level, it get's boring.Two words. BORING GAME."
5,Love 'em!,"These are darling capris-BUY THEM! I couldn't love them more. (I was surprised that the side zipper pocket is not really a cargo pocket but is actually just big enough for a credit card.) Don't be concerned about the way the sizing is stated. I found an 11/12 to be what I would expect from a 12. I would say they are missy sized, not Jr."
3,decent read,"Sanders has a somewhat minimilist writing style which took a few pages to get accustomed to. However, once I did, I found the characters and stories engaging.All three stories in the book were good. Timothy is an interesting character, whose lifestyle matches the author's writing style -- sparse. I identified well with Timothy. Other characters also have their own personalities, although they aren't as strong as the main character.Overall, it's a good read, especially if you like New York, where the stories take place."
1,"Trite, lightwieght and full of shortcuts.","Don't get me wrong. I like mysteries and P.I. stories. I collect them - I have thousands in my library. But this has got to be one of the worst fictions I have encountered. Even my wife, who finishes everything she reads, threw this one down by page 50 or so. I don't know Sanders, but he must've been taking a holiday when he wrote this."
4,Tdesign7,I found this book very helpful in giving you insight and direction when trying to start out as a construction manager. It gives you ideas on how to precede from the beginning without having had much instruction.For more in depth detail you will need to go to other sources. But Like I said this book gives you pretty good direction in which way to turn.
3,Drink a Six Pack First!,"Six punk bands play their worst! Best? Whatever. No airplay for these guys--this music doesn't fit into nice commercial bourgeois categories. Bleeding edge, late nineties, punk. If you want a more refined sound, that goes better with Coca-Cola, look elsewhere. If you want music that will inpire you to beat yourself or others with your coke bottle, look no further."
5,Great Retrospect As Well As Storyline,"Books that are hard to put down are sadly few and far between, but this one is definitely in the select few that make it to that list.I was most impressed with the author's capturing of the 60's and 70's era which was both wonderful and from what I remember, very accurate. Not only did it bring back memories, but the realization that although we at the time thought things were moving along so quickly in terms of changes to societies values and morals, we had only just begun. The friend who recommended this book compared it to Wally Lamb's ""She's Come Undone"" and I do agree, though with less of a ""surreal"" quality that seemed to develop as Mr. Lamb's storyline seemed to progress.A great story of families, friendships, growing up different andjust plain ""growing""."
4,A Step Back in Time,This was a quick read in spite of the book's thickness. I loved and hated the protagonist in the story. I loved her for her bright mind and tender heart and I hated her for her resistance to change and her unwillingness to accept change in others. The era (early - mid 70's) was the era I grew up in and all the old songs and styles really took me back. There were times when I wanted to weep and times when I laughed aloud. The ending ties up with the beginning nicely but at the same time is a little unexpected.
3,HRM okay / Polar service bad,"I upgraded from a very basic HR monitor to this one because it calculated calories burned, had a baseline fitness check and a logged successive workouts.Unfortunately, it proved unreliable. After five months, the watch died, leaving me with nothing but a ""memory failed"" message. (For $179 I expect a longer lifespan than this.) It carries a two year warranty, so I thought I could just trade it in for a new one at the store where I purchased it. Noooo! I had to send it back to Polar for warranty repairs.Polar said it would take 5-7 days for them to mail the watch back to me. It's now been two weeks and they are just getting around to fixing it. When it was working the HR monitor was great. Service from Polar definitely leaves something to be desired..."
2,Don't get this if you wear polarized sunglasses,"The watch face just looks like rainbows so you can't see a thing. I returned mine for this reason. Otherwise, it's fine."
5,I AM THE AUTHOR,"Hello there...I hope that you have just as much joy reading this work as I had writing for you and so many others. There is a lot of life in that book...the heart is warm, it's beating and it's ready for you to live with it, through it. This isn't just about me, although a gentle weaving story of my life, an abstract autobiographical book of poetry you might say, is prominent I only hope that this tome will speak volumes to gays, straights, lesbians, transgendered and bisexual people that live, love, work and play just as hard as everyone else. This is OUR book. You've felt the pain, the humiliation, the hilarity, the inquisitiveness, the spiritualness all about growing up, or being gay, or falling in love, or breaking up, or finding your true dogma...it's a reminiscint ""saga"" of that. And there will be a sequel, a much more grittier edition called MODERN NO 20 coming out later this year. THANK YOU! and I love you ALL! Arthur E. Shattuck II"
1,The Shadow,I was so looking forward to recieving this disc and I could not hear any of it clearly and ended up retiurning it. What a big disappointment. It is a hassle to return items and this was no exception. Bummer - big big bummer
3,Nice But Broke,"As mentioned by others, my wife saw this exact item in a large jewelery retail store and fell in love. However, before we could get back to actually buy it, they stopped carrying the item and she was quite disappointed. So, I was thoroughly thrilled to find it here at Amazon and ordered one up for Christmas. As expected, she was thrilled and loved it, right up to the point when the stone fell out of the setting. Amazon will not send a replacement so I guess I'll have to return it and see about finding a replacement ....."
3,Sweet story but no CD included,"I bought this for my husband who has two beautiful dauthers. I love the story and they like reading it with him. But, I was disappointed to get the book and the CD was not included, as it should have been. Billy Joel is such a great story teller... in music and in books!"
5,For All Daughters & Granddaughters,Here is a book and CD which makes a perfect gift for new daughters and granddaughters which they can keep for their own daughters and granddaughters. It is very well illustrated adding a visual presence to a beautiful lullabye.
2,Title was miss-leading,"The title said book & audio CD. It came without the CD. I guess in the description the seller mentioned it, I realized that after I received the product. If there is no CD, CD should not be stated in the title!"
4,The Zork Chronicles: more than just the game.,"The Zork Chronicles tells the tale of Glorian, the supernatural guide, as he assists Mirakles (a muscle-bound hero) in a quest to kill an evil wizard. The characters run around the Great Underground Empire, visiting places familiar to those who have played the Zork games by Infocom. The book, however, is much more than just a tale of the Empire hundreds of years after the ""mysterious stranger"" pillaged it. Zork Chronicles is a thinly veiled satire which plays upon the traditional roles assigned to characters in epic quests. The humor is subtle, sometimes sarcastic, and always enjoyable."
3,movie does not go far enough,I watched this movie and I liked the small part that Thomas Sangster played in this movie. This child is a brilliant actor and should have been given more time in the movie (at least 30 minutes of film footage). I totally liked him in Entrusted a story about the nazi/world war II era. This story is about a brilliant little boy who happens to be a chessmaster who has memorized the Swiss bank account codes taught to him by his mother. He must make it to Switzerland to give the account codes in order to release the funds to help jewish people escape. The German Nazis are after the funds to help get extra revenues for their war goals.
4,lS ANYB0DY LlSTENING?!?!,This mini-series would've been better had they dealt with the subjects dealt with in the History Channel's documentary ''High Hitler''. Where they revealed that ''Uncle Dolfie'' had an addiction to pain pills which cotributed to a plethora of health problems like gas. Supposedly the Fuhrur farted like a buffalo. He also had battles with constipation and at times he had diarrhea that could polute the Rhein.
1,Poorly written at best,"I saw this when it first came on CBS. Such an excellent cast, excellent setting, yet the dialogue and overall portrayal of Hitler were poor at best. It is as though the good writers were off that week. I recommend ""Downfall"" or ""Conspiracy"" for a portrayal of Nazi politics, not this. This film had so much potential to be good and it was utterly ruined."
1,First 6 to 8 chapters condensed ...,"The first 6 to 8 chapters on this DVD are condensed to one sentence clips, knocking out whole characters and all of the story. The whole first 20 years of Hitler's life are reduced to a few minutes that don't have any continuity or make any sense. At about age twenty the makes of this DVD seem to let the series run although there are still many big jumps in the story so they slashed the series big time. A big disappointment."
1,throw it into a trash can,"Clear, witty, but a over-simplified and biased treatment of liberal scholars. Sometimes, the author reveals his ignorance of current philosophical trends. And sometiems, he seems to distort intentionally critical theories; who said that white is primitive and Africa is the origin of human beings?"
4,Whistle Blowing in Academe,"Roger Kimball was one of the first to blow the whistle on the absurdities of the modern academia where classic humanities programs, which once began with a reverent study of the great books, have been discarded for the study of Mickey Mouse and Madonna. Tenured professors with nothing to lose are instructing the young with a political agenda which consists of rejecting anything that smacks of the white male European influence. Instead the nation's youth are asked to study second-rate ethnic, feminist or pop literature in the name of a university education. Kimball's book is so full of academic craziness that his study might rate as one of the great humor books of all times if it were not so frightening."
4,Great piece of local / NYS history!,This is a wonderful book. It makes a great addition to anyone's New York State history collection. I was pleasantly surprised to see the volume and variety of illustrations. Everything seems to be well documented and the sources cited appropriately. I thoroughly recommend this book!!
5,Hella Sick Gangsta Rap,"C-Bo comes real tight on his 1995 album ""Tales From the Crypt""(re-released in 2002). He has a hard flow, and even harder, menacing beats, with frequent use of the whistly keyboard synth. His beats are generaly hard core, bass heavy G-Funk. If you love lowrider music, this one is premium!"
1,TITLE IS MISLEADING,"IF A READER IS LOOKING FOR A SERIOUS COMPILATION OF THE BATTLES, ORDERS OF BATTLE, MAPS, DESCRIPTIONS, CASUALTIES, WINNERS, LOOSERS ETC., THE READER WILL BE DISAPPOINTED. IF ONE WANTS TO REVISIT THE ANTI WAR EMOTIONS OF THE TIMES, HE MAY FIND THE BOOK INTERESTING."
4,Mega-Hella Drones,"Probably one of the better ""drone"" CDs out there. Would definitely appeal to fans of E.A.R. and other ambient/chill type cds. Pure bliss, pure hum."
2,Maybe better on drugs?,"I've got to say that I really wanted to love this one. It has been described using adjectives and analogies so appealing to me (minimal, heavy, Melvins, etc.) Yet every time I listen, I just feel like I'm back in high school, late at night in my buddy's basement, bored as hell, listening to two stoned dudes trip out with their guitars.Maybe the other reviewers have better stereos or better drugs, but this one just doesn't live up to its promise for me."
4,One very important thought,"This is not an album that you listen to like most albums. The idea isn't to actively listen to it song by song; you start with track one and just let it fill the room/headphones while you go about doing whatever you do. It's like a piece of furniture or a new color of paint on the wall - it's essentially gigantic, powerful background music. For me it doesn't really reach its full effect until I almost forget it's on and it starts to put its flavor/color on whatever I'm doing. Read a book while its playing - you will interpret the story in a much different way than before. Draw a picture while its playing - you'll definitely see it. Cook a meal while its playing - Earth is a spice, as well."
5,Worked Fabulous For Us,"This camera works wonderful for us. I give it a five star rating. No complicated cables to install. Quick, easy and works terrific. This is the second one we bought. Our daughter liked how well it worked for us that we bought one as a gift for their home. Picture is very clear and we have that added sense of security with it! Five star rating!!!"
4,Fun and Learning Game,"I purchased this game for my 4 year old grandson. He has spent many hours playing the game. Since I am a former preschool teacher, I am please with the many learning skills that are included."
5,If you think poetry should be taken seriously as a literary option this is a book for you,"Not satisfied with your literary outlook? Well this might be worth alook. Takes some research though,but, in the end worth it.With science now running the universities in all but name, the idea ofstudy simply for the love of study looks rather inane when contrasted withthe vast output of infotainment by the mass media.Reading Corkery could help you to see through a lot of this, and helpyou to form your thoughts according to your own particular genius,whatever that may be. I think it has more than an Irish application,thinking of a scene that could have been familiar to some of the poetsin the book, the lines of Grey's Elegy comes to mind. So love of poetryapplies to all races."
3,Disappointing,Having read other reviews my hopes for this work were high. But I found the blotchy style of artwork unattractive. I had to use a magnifying glass to decipher the stylized lettering. The silly place and person names were tiresome and really put me off. The one redeeming quality was that on occasion the writing soared to heights of moving eloquence.
1,this book is to confusing,i recently read this book with hopes that it would be an interesting talke of how a child grows up and becomes oneself. This book however was intersting up to the quarter of the book. It jumps around the story with no absolute desintation and the world the characters live in are ubsurd and unbelievable. I quickly got tired of this book waiting for it to end because it seemed no to have a destination.
1,This book was insane,"To put it bluntly, I found this book slow moving and boring. I don't have the trade paperback, but the 12 arc series. I found the sexual references out of place and pointlessly sickening, and the characters difficult to understand. THe names were childish enough, but the storyline was destationless and impossible. I wouldn't advise anybody to buy this. Yeah, it's imaginative and yes the watercolour plates are interesting enough, but the storyline needs complete help. As a comic collector, I'd recommend the Mandrake/Ostrander Spectre series from the late 90's for a real adventure."
2,"Worked for 12 months, but now completely dead","For the first 12 months, the product worked as advertised. However, after time one of the four ports became unusuable. I moved that cable to a different port, so I could keep using the hub.Recently however, the unit has become completely dead. No power lights, no indication that anything is happening. Self-powered lights are also off.I'm planning to buy a new one, but from a different brand."
1,Piece of crap,The device stopped working after I had it for 2 months. This product is not worht the trouble...I bought the LinkSys to replace it and am very pleased.
1,Dont' Buy This - Died after a week,"I Purchased the D-Link USB hub to hook up printer, cameras, etc. It came up fine and worked for about a week. Then I started getting ""not connected"" messages from my printer and scanner. After checking the hub I noticed that the green connection lights were out and only the power light was on. Apparently, either the power supply or board was defective. Based on the large number of similar reviews here, I would not recommend purchasing it. It's junk."
2,Cheap hub - Cheap Results,"I have owned this hub for about a year. For the most part, I was very satisfied with the hub when I was only using a couple of USB devices going into the hub.However, I recently bought a USB CD-RW. On top of a printer, USB keyboard, etc. the CD-RW was just too much. I agree with the other reviewer, just spend an extra few bucks and get a robust hub that will last you a while, through multiple upgrades."
1,Seems great - but flawed,"While the product seems quite convenient in principle, it draws too much current from the computer. As a result, I am unable to turn on the computer while the hub is plugged into it. At the end of the day, the hub is completely useless."
1,It [is not good]!,"This is the worst USB Hub i've ever had the displeasure of working with. Several times a day it loses power and all devices connected to it stop working for upto 1 minute until it starts working again. I can't afford for this to happen as often as it is. I've never had a hub do this before nor have I heard of any hub having this problem. I would recommend LINKSYS and nothing else! Remember the saying....""You get what you pay for""!"
1,Locked up my computer keyboard,"When I hooked up it locked up my keyboard, specifically the Num Lock, Cap Lock and Scroll Lock lights all came on, and the keyboard would not respond. Tried several times and everytime the results were the same. I have a Dell computer with Win 98. If this will work with your computer you can't beat the price, espically after the rebate. ...."
2,"Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't","It's really weird, I can't explain it--most of the time it works perfectly, but sometimes it justs stops working. But even though it works most of the time, I'd just save yourself the trouble and spend 10 bucks more to get a hub that works all of time. You know what they say, if it looks too good to be true, it probably is, and i think that that is the case with this product."
3,"Nice Function, Poor Durability","This product does it's job in a very unobtrusive manner. It was able to be plugged in and used without any drama. However, about 2 weeks after I got it, one of the downstream ports started drawing too much durrent and has since been disabled by the computer."
5,Great device at a great price,"I purchased this hub to increase the number of USB ports on my machine. When it arrived I read the instructions (very minimal manual) and installed the hub and rebooted to Win98, the device was detected right away along with my scanner and steering wheel. I then rebooted into Win2k and repeated the procedure. My total setup time for the hub was about 10 minutes, including rebooting. I would recommend this for anyone who wants to increase the number of USB ports at very little cost.Other then the limited instructions, I love everything about this unit, I put it on my desk behind my monitor so I don't even know its there."
2,It's like Christmas!,"I hate to be one of those ""this thing doesn't work"" people, but my experience with this item falls just south of a root canal sans novacaine. The reason I bought a hub was to, well, hub things. I had enough USB devices to merit it, and after installation, I thought my troubles were over. No more plugging and unplugging. My bad. Each of the 4 ports had it's own personality. One didn't like the tablet, but loved the SmartMedia reader. It was ambivalent towards the scanner. Another happily took the visor but shunned the scanner.Getting each peripheral to work together at the same time was impossible. Granted, some USB devices don't like to share, like the Nomad Docking station and the printer, but it makes me wonder about how a person could possible link 127 devices at the same time. I had a heck of a time with 3."
4,good hub,"My computer has two usb ports but i have a printer a scanner and some other accesories that need usb connection. So i was thinking about buying a usb hub. I buy this one. I take me i few minutes to install it. It works very good, easy to connect to one of usb ports. Supports high and low speeds. It has 4 type downstream ports. Great hub at a great price $ 39 ."
2,D-Link doesn't link,"Being a novice, this out of the box product's directions are extremely vague. I suggest the booklet was written in a non-english speaking country. Just vague and uninformative. This product actually was plug n play, My personal expierence however, was that it plugged in and played for about 1 hour. When I powered up my computer the next day, it had discontined working. Trying to contact this company thru their website was another trick. When I did get to the tech site and asked for help or suggestions, a week had passed without any contact. I've decided to forgo this particular product and try another...too bad.But for the price, I guess you get what you pay for..."

2,D-Link DSB-H4 seems underpowered,At first I found these hubs great. Then I tried to add more USB devices and I found that several of them failed to work any more. This included a SmartMedia reader and a QPS CD-RW drive in particular. For that reason I would highly recommend buying a hub with more power if you are going to attach several USB devices to a single hub....
1,risky purchase,Great price. However this unit burned up as soon as it was plugged in to the wall. Isolated incident or disturbing trend?
1,Very unstable....Will not last,This item worked excellent!!!! ...For ONE day.Came in the next morning and I had no power to the hub and nothing would work no matter what i tried. ... It is a piece of junk.
5,"Plug it in, and it's a GO!","This hub is really very easy to install. Plug it and you're done! The AC adapter is included in case the devices need more power. It can be used without the adapter as well. It looks great, it's very small so it doesn't occupied precious space and it's affordable."
2,not compatible with Windows XP,"I bought it for a month, and it worked fine until i installed Windows XP, and could not get it working. And btw there is no driver for it. So basically i am stuck with a piece of hardware that doesn't work under new system. So beware, if you want to upgrade to XP."
3,"Good design, but poor quality","This is a nifty little box. It matches my iMac nicely. I also love the way it works, when it works. That's my beef with this product. It is flakey. Sometimes it goes off-line and just a tap to the case will bring it back. Sometimes I have to wait until the moon is back in phase before it will work. I think it has a bad solder joint in there somewhere.Do not believe the lifetime warranty and free support. It simply is not true. I have written to complain to the customer support folks and have been summarily ignored.I'd recommend you buy something else. Next time I certainly will."
