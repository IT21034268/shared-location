5,great game.,I can sit and play ths game for hours and not get bored. It is not very hard (at a early stage in the game)and then it gets harder. you start off with 10000 and i bougt a micra turbo for 3445 and then i bougt a skyline and i havn't bought a new car since.The game has really good realism and good graphics. it is also realistic the way you can buy used cars like i did at the beggining but whats unrealistic is that when you buy a used car it is still there when you look to buy another one. This is a great game and i highly recommend it. Hint: When you start off i recommend you buy a used nissan skyline because they are fast and cheap.
4,RACING MANIAC,"I really liked this game,but there was a glitch somewhere in the c.d. The sound of some of the cars was not very consistent {FORD G T 40 SOUNDED CRUMMY} & the record times [upper right-hand corner of screen] do not display,or save no matter what I do. I've had this game since X-Mas [ my son bought it for me] & have completed 98.28%of it. If not for the aforementioned problems,I would rate this game a 5 on a scale of 5. P.S. I'm over 40,whoever said this game is for 5 to 20 yr. olds must be at least 400!"
5,Great Driving Game,The graphics and control in this game are great. When you get up into some of the higher levels you need unreal reflexes to keep the car on the course. Can't wait for the PS2 version comes out.
4,GT2,"This was a great sequel. The game play was very much the same as the original - but there are new cars, tracks, tuning options, and more competitive racing from the machine. I think that it is a great part II and am looking forward to some better graphics and speed with a GT release for the upcoming Playstation II."
5,The price amazed me,"I paid... get this... forty cents for this! The S&H; not counted, I paid FORTY CENTS!!I have played GT2 before, but my ""friend"" stole my last copy so I had to buy a new one. Amazon.com was my hero once again =D"
1,Worst Racing Game I've Ever Played!!,"This is the worst racing game I have ever played, you start out with a car that can only go about 60 mph at the maximum, and even then, you spin out on about every corner. Spinning out is way to common in this game, if you are behind a car and try to go a little to the left or right to pass it, you could spin out, it takes all of the speed out of the game, and the tracks are short, boring, and few. I would much rather have less than 500 cars in order to get more interactive tracks, instead of having over 500 cars, which is pointless because you aren't going to use them all unless you dedicate you life to it!! The tracks are one way, there are no shortcuts, no ramps, no signes that you can run over and knock down, nothing. With the bad tracks, too many cars to use, and the terrible control, this is by far the worst racing game I've ever played. It would be a better value to buy San Francisco Rush for $...than it would be to buy this game for $..."
2,Major dissappointment!,"Over 400 licensed cars, numerous tracks, offroad and onroad racing, and a sequel to the best racing game of all time! The stuff-o-meter is bursting! Sound like a mixture for pure bliss? Your right! It is! However, this game doesn't live up to what it should be. The graphics would have looked good 3 years ago, and the cars, and I mean all the cars, handle terribly! Avoid this game! Buy the original! It's a much better game!"
3,3 stars,I thought that it was okay. Actualy it sucked. The graphics have not changed and the corners are to hard too turn. It is really crappy don't buy it.
5,BEST RACING GAME!,"hi people.. well i think this games the best racing one ever.. im a professional of this game.. and i guarantee u. this game is so easy. but i dont like the endurances cuz it takes too much time. i did them for the first gran turismo and i took me around 2 hours and a half to finish the endurances. and in gt2, there r like 7 endurances but in gt, there r only 2. well i think this is a must buy game for all the racing fans. and i am."
5,GT 2 is the best Racing Game i've ever played on PSx,Grand Turismo 2 is the best playstation racing game i've ever played with more than 500 cars u can pick from Honda Civic to Lexus excellent graphics the only downside is that they should have added more racers not just 6 and also forgot Ferrari too but GT2 is still the best racing game i've ever played a must game for PSX
5,Very Well Made Game,"Gran Turismo 2 took the 1st game and made it 1000 times better. Featuring cars from all around the world, real life courses like laguna seca, and an amazing soundtrack, Gran Turismo 2 is probably the best racing game ever created. This game is a Must Buy!"
5,"If you're a racer , you'll need this game !",I'm a one fingered typer so I'll keep this short . This is by far the most authentic auto racing game known to man .... bar none . Try the chassis changes anywhere else and see what happens . way too real !
1,Very disappointing.,"Are the people giving this game 5 stars playing the same game I am? The original Gran Turismo was by far the best driving game ever. What happened to the sequel? Choppy graphics and extreme slowness make this game unplayable.There's just no sense of speed like the original, it feels like you're going about 15 mph. Who cares if you can buy over 500 cars if the racing is this boring. Good thing I only rented it."
3,Its alright,I like this game alot its just it gets a little boring after awhile. You get lots of new cars and car manufactures. You get new tracks including dirt tracks. You get some good music and some cool endurance races where you rac for 100 laps. I like this game its just it gets boring after a few months because youll own alot of cars and race with em over and over and over but i like the way the game is realistic because of the upgrades for the cars like brakes and wheels and they give you a very long paragraph on how it works. Its a nice game but may get boring.
3,A driving game ( not a true racing game),If your a car buff and want to race (Short races) a whole lot of cars this is an excellent game. If your looking for a true racing game you may be disappointed.
2,GT 1 beats GT 2,"Save yourself some money. Buy the original Gran Turismo. I got GT 2 in February and have played it a grand total of three times while I continue to enjoy the original release. It's clear that the manufacturer rushed this game to market (they missed several target release dates in 99' trying to get it into stores before Christmas). While it's true that vehicle choices are greater, game complexity is too much, race and screen transitions are too slow and you can't qualify your car for a race--instead you're relegated to 6th spot on the grid every time. Too bad, I was looking forward to better things based on the outstanding nature of the original."
1,horrible,the only good thing about this game is the fact that there is just about any car you have ever seen or heard of but the racing aspect of it is horrible its hard to steer and if you go off the road at all you start to lose control i would recommend tokyo xtreme racer for dreamcast its the best racing game out
1,One of the worst racing games for PS1!!,"Gran Turismo is one of hte worst racing games for Playstation1. Why? Because first, this is a RACING GAME not a RAILROAD SIM. Second, just because it has 300 million cars doen't mean they're cars you would want to drive, or even look at. Third, they wasted to much time getting all those stupid cars instead of oh I don't know, making it more fun to play."
1,a new kind of crap,"I hate this game so much! The graphics are really grainy and choppy. The frame rate must be less than 15 frames per second! There's absolutely no replay value at all. Whatever you do, don't even spend a penny on this game. It gives crap a whole new meaning! Avoid this game at all cost!"
1,"I really, really hate this game!!!!","I hated this game so much that within an hour of purchase, I gave it to the kid next door. Thank God it costs me only $19 bucks.Turning a corner in a race with this game proved next to impossible without sliding all over the track. When you're going 100 miles per hour you look as though you're only doing only 30. And what happened to the so called great graphics? Where? If this is the best of the best, I hate to see the worse. Give me Nascar Rumble any day.I really, really, really hated this game. I can't even find the words to describe how much I hate this game."
1,Overrated!,"GT2, to use it's own coinage, is a big fat lemon. This game sucks, and you would be well advised to avoid these other comments. The cars are nice, the graphics are descent, but the game moves SO slow. It just feels slow. I could pass up the cars in this game on a tricycle. Very not cool."
2,Gran Turismo is not that good,"I Disliked Grsn Turismo beacuse you can not buy a good car at the begining and to get a good car you need to get a lisince wich is hard, also there are no built in codes, you need gameshark, than it would be fun"
4,"The same as 1, but with more cars","Like the first game, it's great, but not much has changed. The graphics still are good, but not great, and its a pretty difficult game- it takes some practice, especially getting all those licenses. The only major improvement is the addition of a ton more cars. If you're trying to decide between 1 and 2, get two, but if you've already got GT1, you won't miss much if you don't get 2."
4,GT2 MY STORY,"BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL,BIGGER WITH MORE CONTROL OF THE CARS. GREATER VARIETY OF CARS AND TRACKS, MIXED WITH MORE CLASSES OF EVENTS MEANS NEVER A DULL RACE. FAVOURITE CARS ARE THE RUF SPORTS CAR AND THE MAZDA R.X.7. IT`S GREAT!"
1,waste of money,i am a zone follower and i think that the zone is a great lifestyle to follow but i was defintetly disappointed in this book. all of dr. sears other books about the zone have been great but i found this book to be a repeat of the other books.. i wish i had of saved my money....i would suggest everyone buy a week in the zone..it is a great book...much better buy than this book!
3,Zone,"Purchased for my father. I am not really into this. There are so many different books out, it's hard to really get good information."
4,excellent job,this is an excellent job is this album. Actually it takes the best part of my summer becouse i kept on listening it. Listen to it.
2,Cyborg Crap Flap,"CYBORG CONQUEST what a piece of crap this film was, I painfully tried to watch it. If you are looking for Terminator type Cyborgs etc, they are NOT in this cheap biker style movie. Actors/Actresses were all bad, script was worse, whoever gave this piece of ______ more than 1 or 2 stars must have been in this horrible movie. Glowing green eyes is about all the CYBORG effects in it. I filed it in File 13 (Trash) after painfully trying to watch it. Was a waste of money & time. I would not recommend to anyone living in the free world."
2,Cyborg Conquest,"Cyborg ConquestHere is a ""B"" Movie That actually had a plot and a story line that made sence. As with all low budget ""B"" movies, The Directing leaves a lot to be desired, However the Actors did the best they could with the material on hand. Suffice me to say, The fault of this movie is not the Actors nor the Writers. The fault lies in the Director who had no Vision, or Clue, How to guide this movie successfully. NOTE To Producers: Redo the Movie & Hire a new Director. A Director not afraid to take chances. A Director with Imagination. The Extra bucks you spend on a good Director will pay off later in the Bank."
3,Paul Lemat in a Leigh Scott sci-fi opus.,"Satisfying...Worth the $7 Coke and $3 popcorn,If We had seen in a mall cinema.This film brings back The Robots unlike Terminator : Salvation.The cast is lead by Stacey Dash & Paul Lemat ,With a heart-felt role by Richard Lynch,Makes the most of unusual plot that actually plays out logically.If you squint you can make out the visages of Rhett Giles and Griff Furst (Leigh Scott buddies with big reps.) in disguise as bar no-goodniks .Paul LeMat (American Graffiti) is back as a evil genius robot maker,Surely what Walt Disney would have devolved into.Must admit Leigh Scott has matured in his craft,Nary a flaw in site for this Sci-Fi adventure.So,Summing up we get motorcycles,Alot of Down Blouse shots of all the actresses,Robot violence,Maybe a resurrection or two( Said very carefully !)."
5,excellent work,"I loved the book. There are hundreds of excellent quality photos, lots of descriptions, wonderful articles, and useful maps to help understanding the old Persia. It covers every aspect of life in ancient Persia: the government, the financial system and daily life. I have watched the photos every day and still want to watch them more. Articles are academically sound, easy to read and the book is well structured.Another good thing about it is that, it reveals the bias introduced to the Ancient history by Greeks."
4,Just A Mess,"this book is about a critter who lost his baseball mit and needs to find it. his mother sugest that he cleans his room and when he tryes to get his family to help him nobody will so he desides to clean it himself but the same as it is with any kid, any where they can shove things to make it look cleaner they will but when he looks for his pillow on the other side of the bed he finds his baesball mit.... mabey moms idea wasnt so bad after all"
5,Just a Mess,"This book is about a critter that lost his baseball mit in his messy room and needs to find it. ... I would recommend this book to children ages 3-12, because they'll have fun finding out that they do almost the same thing sometimes.This book teaches you that you should always keep your room clean and organized so you'll always know where everthing is. You should listen to your mom for tips too."
4,Just A Mess,"Little Critter couldn't find his baseball mitt because his room was such a mess! His mom told him to clean his room, but while he was cleaning his room he lost his pillow. Read this book and see if he ever finds his baseball mitt. Rainken G."
1,Horrible!,"I can't stand this book! There is no lesson. Critter does a terrible job of cleaning his room, yet finds what he is looking for anyway. If you want your kids to think stuffing toys and clothing under the bed and in the closet is cleaning, buy this book; that is the message."
1,Not worth your time. Bad xamples.,"I did not like any of the Mercer Mayer books that I got which includes: I just Forgot; I was so Mad; Just a Mess.There ares ome good points but they are lost amongst the bad ideas they give. I could not believe the bad examples given on all the books, I refused to read the atual story lines to my son. I even feel bad a bout giving these books away because I don't think other kids should be exposed to this."
4,Little Critter Lesson,I read Mercer Mayer's books to my children when they were young 25 years ago...but these Little Critter books do not age. The stories and lessons are just as fresh and enjoyable as they ever were! Highly recommended!
5,fabulous cd,I bought this for my daughter but I love listening to it as dinner music:) We love dancing to the music on this cd. I have now given it several times as a birthday gift and all have loved it.
5,Nice for what it is,"Greenhouses are expensive, and I the adage, you get what you pay for is true. We have bought cheaper greenhouses that have not lasted. So we splurged on this small house to save our plants over the winter. It is well worth the amount of money it cost AND once we figured it out, very easy for two people to put together.We are very pleased with our product that we purchased."
2,Duct Tape Necessary,"The cute little plastic strips that you can ""just pop"" into place to hold the poly-carbonate panels to the greenhouse frame are a joke. About half of them pop in like they were suppose to and are holding the sides properly. The other half would not stay in at all. I would come home from work everyday to find another plastic strip laying in the yard and a panel flapping in the breeze. I resorted to duct tape to hold these panels in and that is working pretty well. Unfortunatly, it isn't very attractive."
3,Mediocre,"We love our new greenhouse, however, we havent been able to finish it completely due to the factory not sending us all of our pieces. We have had to call twice and wait for new parts to be shipped back to us."
5,Great!,"After reading the negative reviews about this product I thought it would be tough to put together. I am 15 years old and I didn't have a problem, it took me two days to put it together and I am very pleased with the product. All I needed was a little help with holding up parts of the frame while I bolted them together. The only set back is that the vent on the roof when closed still is open on the sides and lets cold air in on chilly nights. Over all great greenhouse and I highley recomend it."
2,Just hope the wind does not blow.,It is really not worth the amount of money it costs. A strong gust of wind will cause the panels to pop out. I hope it lasts throught the summer but we have some bets going!
4,Worth it,The instructions were not clear at times. Took us about 6 hours to complete. The greenhouse is very beautiful and sturdy.
2,poor product,"this was so hard to put together, took 2 men all day,In less than a year, panels are always coming apart, stripes fall out.the house is already weathered will not recommend to anyone"
2,poorly written,"This book covers many SQL Server topics in a fairly detailed fashion. However, the structure is so disorganized and the content so poorly written that the book is essentially unreadable. Topics, such as indexing, triggers and administration are frequently discussed hundreds of pages before they are defined and introduced. As for muddled writing, consider this defintion of a computed column from pg. 153:""A computed column is a column of a table that is used to store the result of a computation of a table's data. The most important property of a computed column is that it does not store computed data.""Despite its shortcomings, the book's breadth and surprisingly comprehensive index make it a great reference tool. However, I would not suggest it to anyone as a means of learning SQL Server."
2,"Not a beginner's guide, by my definition of beginner","I'm sure this book was well written to the right audience. But, whoa, not to a real beginner. It may take a few college level IT courses and some experience to begin to grasp the material (IMHO). But, it did come with a CD..."
1,Good thing it wasn't my money...,"I found this book in the company library and hoped it would be a good starting point, not the case. Time to order a decent, well written, well organized book on the basics of SQL Server."
1,only use if you want your clothes DESTROYED!,"I used this product in a load of wash with a pair of black pants (that had been washed 3x) and some other colored clothes. About half of the clothes got blue splotches or a blue tinge to them. I followed the instructions to a T, so there was not a user error. I am SO disappointed with this product! DO NOT use unless you just want an excuse to buy new clothes! If I could, I would have given....No STARS for you Shout color catcher."
1,Worthless,"It sounds like a great idea, but it's basically worthless. It came out of the laundry completely clean. I used the rest of the box to clean out the lint catcher."
4,Shout Color Catchers,"I received a sample product of theShout Color Catcher Dye-Trapping, In-Wash Cloths - 24 easheet and instantly used it when I did a mixed batch of towels. I was so impressed. I did put my not so bright looking white towels in with the lighter brown towels and darker red towels. My white towels (that went into the wash not looking so great) came out whiter and brighter. Not 100% perfectly white, but a definite bigger difference afterwards.I only wish I had purchased a box of these things when my kids were here for Christmas and I was doing their laundry. I'm pretty sure they mix their laundry too when I see their whites that look greyish now."
5,LOVE these things!,"I love these things. I was happy to find them online for a price comparable to my grocery store - but saved me a trip to the store. If you haven't tried these things yet, they're great. Especially when your hubby puts colors in with lights - just tell them to throw one of these things in all the time and you'll rarely have an issue with bleeding colors."
3,Works well but too much perfume,"I really liked the older Shout color catcher, they changed it about three years ago and now it is full of this perfume that lingers in my clothes. I have tried leaving the sheets outside to air out but the perfume can not be conquered.The color trapping action is great. Just lose the scent or make an unscented version, PLEASE"
5,great product,"it really works, I always use when I wash new clothes because the color stays in the sheet and does not stain other clothes, a little expensive to use in all loads, so I still separate whites and colors, and just use these when I buy new clothes."
1,shout color catchers,"I recently tried ""Shout color catchers"" in my laundry. I used cold water for both the wash and rinse cycle. I now have a brand new pair of white shorts with pink spots and a pair of khakis with pink spots. Needless to say I will never purchase this product again."
1,Don't rely on it,I got a couple samples and tried them with darks and my white burp clothes. I didn't want to do it with my good whites till I tested it. All my whites came out a greenish blue tinge. Not happy with this product but good concept. Too bad because I could use more time and money savers!
1,BUYER BEWARE!! Read this before you buy!!,"I was sold on these wipes BUT after the motor burning out, the water pump, and the control panel in my 6 month old front load washing machine....parts alone were over 250, not to mention labor costs of 200....fortunately I had an extended warranty that helped eat some of the costs.....all to find out these wipes were the cause. Found them in the pump/drain trap and somewhere else, the tech showed me. NO MORE will I buy these wipes!!"
1,Not great,I put in one red item into my daughters laundry and 2 color catch sheets. red splotches are now on all the other things in the load. dont trust this product.
2,If it's too good to be true...IT IS!,"I was quite skeptical about this product, but was willing to give it a shot, based on the concept of the product.It works to a degree, but not completely as it is advertised. It works with mixed colored clothes that have white in them (ie baseball shirt: white chest, with colored sleeves), BUT I would not wash whites with colors, using this sheet(s)as the ""color catcher"" as they say. Oh they ""catch"" the dye, but not ALL of it, and your whites end up looking similar to the ""Color Catcher"" sheets at the end of the wash! Just ruined my daughter's brand new AG white pajama top. It now has pink splotches on the back, and I even used 2 sheets. Everything in that load had been washed before, except that pajama top!My vote is for doing your laundry the old fashioned way. Like your mama taught ya! SEPERATE, seperate, seperate your colors from your whites!So, my vote is a NO for this product recommendation to others."
5,goodbuy,"Delivered as promised. Still love this product. Although some companies have now combined spot removing products with color catching, I still use the individual sheets for less soiled clothes."
1,Would not recommend,I purchased these sheets yesterday from my local Walmart and tried them this morning in a wash that had a mix of whites and blue jeans. I used two sheets for my first attempt to be on the safe side. All of my whites came out with a tinge of blue.
5,Rock with local flavor,Very good CD. I had the pleasure of watching Pepe live in Miami on various occasions. The music is still as powerful and contagious as it is live. Not commercialized at all. Enjoyed Comprometida and Todas las Sombras. Ochoa w/ the charango and sampoña is the man! Hope to see a second album (with Cuando el Viento Empuja track).
4,tightly-knit thriller of characters engaged in horrific circumstances,"REVIEWED: Offspring: The Sequel to Off SeasonWRITTEN BY: Jack KetchumPUBLISHED: October, 2006I don't know why, but I've been reading this trilogy of books backwards. First I read ""The Woman,"" (third in the series and most recent), then this book, ""Offspring,"" and next will be the one that started it all off, ""Off Season."" I think that says a lot about these books that, although they reference preceding events, each is a tightly-knit thriller of characters engaged in horrific circumstances. The characters themselves weren't quite as believable/ well-rounded as some of Ketchum's other work, but their actions and the plot twists kept me enthralled the entire time.Four and a Half out of Five stars"
4,A good 'Ol horror sequel,"I have read a lot of reviews of people saying ""This is the same story as Off-Season!"" Well, this is a horror sequel! Just because friday the 13th part 2 was exactly like part one, Doesn't mean I didn't have a great time watching it. There are some new kills and some new characters that I found very interesting( I really dug the kid Luke and how he took care of the baby.) If you enjoyed Off-Season, I highly recommend this sequel. Of coure its not as good as its Predecessor, but it's still a very entertaining,and well written book."
4,Offspring,"I found it to be a continuation of Off Season; which was fine by me. I found it to be just as gory and nasty as Off Season and it held my attention to the end. However, I was disappointed in the ending. Since the way the book ended I expected to find another book playing off of Offspring. Sadly enough there isn't one. Ketchum writes some gory, bloody, wild books but I don't think there'll be any others to peak my interest as these two books."
4,Cannibals and slashers,"I read some good reviews about this one and it did not dissapoint. Some cannibals who live in a cave attack a cabin in the woods and start killing the people who live there. The cannibals even have cannibal kids that eat people! It's pretty gross but fun and I squirmed at times. In their cave they have some insane beast guy they call the Cow who reminded me of something from a Rob Zombie film. Anyway, there's tons of blood and gore and I recommend this if you like gross horror films. Apparently this is a sequel so I still have to read the first book."
4,"A quick, dread-laden read","I've read some reviews here that mention that Offspring contains the same basic plot as ""Off Season"", and well yeah, it sure does. But so does about a thousand other horror offerings from Richard Laymon's ""Midnight's Lair"" and Tobe Hooper's classic ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre.""What makes Ketchum's ""Off Season"" and ""Offspring"" different is Ketchum's strong prose and great characterizations. Ketchum can make characters come alive with a few simple sentences enough to make an impact when bad things happen to the good people in the novel. And when bad things happen to bad people, you're both satisfied that justice has been served but repulsed by the horrors that happen.""Offspring"" may not blow you away some of Ketchum's other work does (i.e. ""Girl Next Door""), but it is an exercise in mounting dread and quickly turned pages. If you enjoyed ""Off Season"", there's more than enough here to keep you entertained."
4,Tamer than Off Season,"Offspring is the sequel to Ketchum's (gorfest) Off Season. The Woman is back, and she's got a whole new cannibal family. The beginning of the story starts with the cannibal clan taking out a 16 year old babysitter, the 18 month old baby, and the mother returning from a night out at the bar. Yeah, it's craziness all over again. Except this time, the cops know exactly what they are dealing with.Even with that being the opening to the story, this book is still much tamer, in my opinion, than Off Season. I think this book is generally more about the characters (potential victims) than the gore factor this time around. Offspring was a quick and easy read. I think I finished it in a day and a half."
3,"on Jack Ketchum's ""Offspring""","This is the first Jack Ketchum book I've read, and his reputation for visceral horror is well-deserved. Forget about building the suspense slowly. It's carnage from beginning to end. In a matter-of-fact tone, he writes: ""Her arms were drying in the sink. Along with the dishes."" There's power in Ketchum's storytelling which draws the reader in. It's the same magic in Wes Craven's The Hills Have Eyes. You smell the fear, the blood, the excrement. Urine, too. Offspring is a well-told story about a wandering tribe of cannibals and how some of the characters from Ketchum's previous book, Off Season, fight them off."
4,"Good overview of Miracles' output between 1960 and 1967,","A wonderful import album for the Motown Fan. This collection does give you different tracks than that of the also wonderful 35th anniversary box set. This disc features the ballad ""Would I Love You"" from 1964 which was left off the box set. Other cuts like ""If You Mother Only Knew"" and ""Such Is Love, Such Is Life"" give the listener a chance to experience the maturation of Smokey as a songwriter and singer. Recommended for the Motown fan like myself."
5,"Basic, but good","After about 15 years off, I started playing chess again about three months ago. I did so badly -- I couldn't beat my PalmPilot at the easy level! -- I realized I needed help. Alhough unrated, I would probably clock in somewhere between 1000-1100 (According to the Chessmaster 9000, anyway. Take that as you will).I've read two of Robertie's books, this one and ""Winning Chess Openings."" Both of them deserve the same review:Although this is a very basic book, it's PERFECT for a beginner like me. He starts out with simple concepts and then builds up, and spends his time teaching the basic ideas, whereas other books emphasize material too advanced for a beginning player."
4,Modern Authors Should Learn From Greene,"A young Jewish currant magnate who is only ""a Jew"" to Europeans; a virginal chorus-girl who is perceived only as a ""nice pair of legs""; a newswoman who hates men for their arrogance; a self-impressed murderer; and a fugitive Communist leader are all riding a train whose ultimate destination is Istanboul. Greene skilfully weaves their stories together and apart, forcing the reader to ponder questions about love, sex, duty, and morality."
3,Interesting but not new,"I hoped that this book would give me new/better information on the ""quilt as you go"" technique. Alas, this book has mostly the same ideas and, while it is okay, I got confused about how to ""hide"" the seams."
5,Mile A Minute Quilts,"I haven't tried this technique yet, but it looks very doable. I think it will be a technique I will use and reuse."
2,Not what I expected,"I was wanting to learn an entirely different technique - also called ""Mile-a-minute"" where you sew strips together with ""crumbs"" and keep going until you have enough to trim them into blocks. This is probably going to end up as a door prize at my guild meeting."
4,I Couldn't Put It Down,"A very absorbing read. I found myself staying up to 4AM to finish it, because I had to know how it all turned out. The identity of the killer turned out to be a complete surprise. I hadn't even come close to suspecting him. The protagonist, Saxon, is a bit of a bitch, but there is something deeply likeable about her. I enjoyed the interactions between Saxon, her lover, and the world at large. Pick this one up, it's worth it!"
3,I can see this as a film starring Ashley Judd ...,"This is very much a formula thriller where there are multiple suspects and the killer spends an inordinate amount of time constructing cryptic clues for the police to follow. There are a few twists - the heroine - an American ex-FBI agent - is a lesbian, the role played by the killer in the investigation(no spoilers but I think this is a first in terms of motive, didn't totally buy it though). I did guess the identity of the killer pretty early on - again no spoilers - but in my experience if there is an unidentified dead body in a thriller focusing on who might have the motive to conceal a victim's identity often leads to the killer.Formula thriller aside I rather like the atmospheric descriptions of Dublin and would have liked the novel to focus a bit more on Grace and Saxon's relationship. I would probably read another book by this writer out of curiosity if nothing else."
4,A Surprisingly Good Read,"I picked up this book in the bargain bin at a post Christmas sale and was pleasantly surprised by the quality. Yes, an outsider would likely not have such access to an ongoing investigation, but the heroine, Saxon, is a well-written one. You're given enough of her history to be intrigued, but not so much that it bogs you down. The plot had enough twists that at times I wasn't convinced that I wouldn't turn up on the suspect list."
5,Terro ant killer,"I have used Terro for years, I used to get it at Walgreens but they stoped selling it but I got it on Amazon for a better price and they shiped it to me right away. It takes a few days but they take it like candy and then they are all GONE !!! Sharon Maiden"
2,Not quite sold -- seems messy,"I saw so many good reviews of this product, I figured, why not give it a try? I'm not sold. The whole process of putting this sticky fluid on little pieces of cardboard, then leaving them around your house....it's just a pain and it's messy. The fluid reminds me of the liquid coffee sweetener you used to see in offices in the 1970s and 1980s. It's just sticky and gross. To add insult to injury, the ants avoided the stuff like the plague. Seriously one night I watched ants walk toward the product, stop on their heels just short of the product and beeline in the other direction! The ants actually won't go near it! I'm going back to the self-contained ant traps....the ants at least seem to congregate more around and in those."
5,Works as advertised,Simply the best on the market. Messy and possibly dangerous around small pets/kids though. Plus it generates LOTS of ant traffic while the ingest it.
4,Terro is the best ant poison ever made,"This stuff is the only stuff that has consistently worked for me. The active ingredient is Borax, which is relatively non-toxic in case an animal accidently gets a hold of it. It's incredibly hard to find in supermarkets for some reason."
2,Disappointing results,"After reading all the great reviews about this product here on Amazon, I thought for sure this product would take care of my ant problem. Nope..the people that said that you are basically just feeding the ants are correct. The ants are really attracted to this bait...but they eat and then just continue on their way. The liquid dries up and becomes hard very quickly also, once this happens, the ants won't touch it.Two weeks later, and with no visible results, I've thrown in the towel =("
5,"Terro rules! Sorry ants, party is over!","Had some little house ants near my door wall out to the deck. The little buggers were making their way into the kitchen, the half bath near the front door, and behind the TV.I bought a 9 pack of Terro Ant Bait at Home Depot. Followed the easy instructions, placed the baits near the ants entry points. And it was party time! Within a short time, the ants had found the baits, told their buddies, and they were all out lining up for a drink. Taking it back to their hood and sharing it with their pals.It's day 2 already and most of the ants are gone. Just a few stragglers that are stumbling around (the Borax kicking in).Thanks Terro! Quick, easy, effective, and easy on the wallet!!"
1,Didn't work for me.,"Based on the positive reviews, I purchased the Terro product to deal with the problem of sugar ants in the kitchen. Maybe I have some smart ants, or this product doesn't come across as appealing to them, because they won't go near the liquid bait. Even when I herded some of the ants onto the baited area, they didn't touch it. I guess it's back to the drawing board."
1,ant killer not what it usded to be,terro used to have arsenic in it which killed the ants completely. Now arsenic isnt allowed and the boric acid's results are anemic.
5,Great stuff it actually works!,"I made a mistake of NOT reading the amazom reviews here before buying Raid Double Control Ant Bait at the local walmart.It does not work at all!So I bought this here after reading the reviews.I had carpenter ants in the kitchen came from a crack in wall, only saw about 5-8 at a time but when I put the bates out about 150-200 came out to eat the liquid!Next day I saw 1 ant wandering around, gave him 1 drop of liquid, he was gone.Its been 2 weeks now,have not seen ANY inside so i put some liquid near a nest outside the house, they eat it and died next day.Even the really large fast moving ants liked it.The drawback is that it dries after about 35-40 min so I have to put new drops out 1 drop at a time, but its no big deal.highly recommended!"
3,not sure how good it is now!,"I have been applying this to annoying ants for one week in back yard so far, it seems more and more ants coming and they like the taste, they come to enjoy the liquid, hope the miracle happened later on, next week? I will update here."
5,Simply amazing,"I had a minor ant problem around the kitchen and bathroom areas. I tried those small black plastic ant baits...no effect. I used sprays and pesticides but those seemed to work temporarily not to mention the smell. I tried vinegar and most other household products to eliminate the ant problem...no effect. Someone told me about Terro but I was initially hesitant about another ""guaranteed"" ant killer. So one day while in Home Depot I came across Terro Ant Killer and purchased it. I followed the simple directions on the box and left 5 to 6 traps in the kitchen and bathroom. Within an hour I examined the traps and noticed a tremendous amount of activity around each of the traps. The next morning I woke up to find zero ants around the traps, and ZERO ants in previous locations where the ants were known to travel. I kept refilling the traps for 3 consecutive days and can claim I am ant free. TERRO WORKS!!! I would highly recommend this product."
2,Not working any more?,"I first tried this product a couple of days ago, which worked perfectly: ants disappeared in about 2-3 days. It also lasted for the entire summer.However, it seemed to me the product has changed somehow. First of all, instead of staying liquid for several days, the liquid turned into a hard gel in a day and lost its effect because ant do not seem to be able to eat it once it solidified. Moreover, it does not kill those ants as it used to. I am quite disappointed in the the bottle I just bouglt."
5,Kills Ants,"This stuff works. Put a few drops in a bottle cap, rather than on the supplied cardboard chits, and leave it our by the ant trail. They will swarm it for a day or so as most of the nest comes up to eat. On the third day there simply aren't any more ants. Easy and effective. Probably not for use around pets or small kids."
3,The jury's still out--paper not cardboard?,"I have had no luck with my tiny ants residing in my kitchen. They never liked Terro, they rarely crawl in trails; they have been driving me nuts for years. I just took some advice from another review and used paper to make about 20 baits in the kitchen, living, dining, and bathrooms. One bait already looks like a watering hole! I am cautiously optimistic. I hope the problem before was that the bait was being absorbed into the cardboard and that I just had too few baits out. Right now, though, the ants are choosing Terro over 2 dozen candy canes a couple feet away on the same counter. I'll take it."
5,ANT-TASTIC!!!!!!!,"For many years I have had problems with ants,everywhere in my home. Despite using various sprays which only helped temporarily, nothing worked. My sister did some research and came across Terro. We purchased some of the baits and MY GOD the ants absolutely love this!!!!!! Initially I was compelled to kill them because I was freaked out that there were so many ants once I had put the baits out, Please, Please, Please fight the urge to kill the ants, because if you do it defeats the purpose. You need the ants to take the poison back to their nest and to the Queen, and sometimes you may have various nests and not know it. Trust me the number of ants will decrease until you see no activity at all. I will definitely recommend this product to anyone who has an ant problemTerro 300 Pre-Filled Liquid Ant Killer II Baits, 6-Pack."
1,Captain Underpants Does Grad School,"An alternate title for this book would be ""Captain Underpants Aces Graduate School (Extra Bonus: 'Frickin' Gratuitous Pseudo-Swearwords on Every Page !)"". I purchased this book based on positive reviews that confused the distinction between lewd and stupid - lewd I can handle. This book will be relished by life members of the fart & burp club who wish to obtain a graduate degree with the least effort. It largely ignores the concept or utility of graduate education. Perhaps the book relfects the biases of the social sciences, but my grad students in the natural sciences would skin me alive if I assigned a book that squandered so many pages on the excessive trappings of extended adolescence while instructing them carefully in the art of dodging. Its key redeaming features are a collection of excellent quotes and written caricatures of professors in the social sciences and humanities - the authors must know my dean."
5,AWESOME BOOK!,"This book has really helped me to reconsider how I am going through my masters program. The chapter on the ""5 R's"" was particularly informative, but the chapters on ""Students You'll Meet Along the Way"" and ""Professors You'll Meet Along the Way"" are dead-on accurate! (not to mention hilarious!)This book does a great job of combining excellent information with a great sense of humor about the entire process. I highly recommend it!"
1,terrible ripoff,"No one should purchase this scam. Between half and three-quarters of the book consists of blank pages with single-line quotes from completely random sources (Shrek, Twain, etc.) The pages that actually pretend to have content are filled with completely obvious statements, repeated over dozens of pages. If this book were 50 condensed pages and one-quarter of the price, it might be worth it for simple amusement. No information in this book will be useful for a potential graduate school student. DO NOT BUY. Use the money for this unjustifiably expensive book on a GRE prep book or, for that matter, anything else."
4,Streetsmarts For Graduate School,Great book! Helps to bring the whole graduate school experience down to ground level so that you won't freak out about it. It also teaches you practical ways to get through without losing your sanity.
2,If not for the humor...,The only positive thing I have to say about this book is that it's funny. I found nothing helpful context-wise. Not worth the money.
4,makes a great conversation coffee table book,"The pictures are awesome! The book is handsome, Very interesting book all around.Many friends have picked it up and we talked about it so much. I'd most deffinatelysuggest this book for anyone."
1,Ugh...,"I'm gonna keep this real short, this is the worst of the three robotech series. It is way to pscychodelic for me.If you are a user of illegal substances, maybe you'd find this good, but I never have, wouldn't encourage it for this piece of poo."

1,Way too easy - BORING!,I mastered this game in 10 minutes - now its gathering dust. Its a good game if you just want to hold the throttle down and watch your bike fly around the track bouncing off invisible walls. If you want a challenge I suggest Supercross 2000. The bike acts much more realistic and its hard to beat the other riders. Supercross Circuit is probably best suited for 6-8 year olds - anyone older is gonna get bored real quick.
4,Very interesting...,"I usually despise tribute albums, I think they are jus an easy way for evrybody involved to ge some bucks, mainly when the tribute is made about a band whom is still active.Anyway, being a huge old AC-DC fan (the AC/DC pre-Ballbreaker), I could not resist to buy this one. Compared with other tribute albuns, in this one the guest musicians really managed to record something unique, creating their own twists to the songs. Very good. My particular favorite was the majestic ""Ride On""."
2,IMHO Straub should stick to novels,"While reading this I felt like I was reading ""flowery"" sentences that lead nowhere & were simply distractions. Although, I thought ""Mr. Clubb and Mr. Cuff"" was an excellent story.The rest...""Ashputtle"" was a strange twisted tale.""Isn't It Romantic?"" was dull & so predictable.""The Ghost Village"" was very good, but seemed like a rerun.""Bunny is Good Bread"" was disturbing, but very good.""Porkpie Hat"" was a good story, but it took forever to get into. While reading the 1st 1/2 I was drowning in a sea of unnecessary information, which might be okay if it was a novel.""Hunger, An Introduction"" was almost painful to read at times.Hopefully ""Houses Without Doors"" will be better..."
3,"MEDIOCRE, NOT MAGIC","This is the first time I have ever read any short stories by Mr. Straub and I was not very impressed, his novels are much better. Several of the stories had good plots but the the story lines got lost in garble and confusion. The stories I liked best were ""Ghost Town"" and ""Mr. Clubb and Mr. Cuff"". The latter story is reminiscent of Clive Barker in its surrealism.If you have time to spare try them out,you might enjoy them."
1,"Cheap Tricks in ""Magic Terror.""","Over half of these shorts were taken from novels PS wrote earlier. So nothing new here. The remainder were as turgid and unreadable as his latest endeavors into the literary world have indicated. These stories simply went nowhere and, with the exception of the Cuff tale, were tedious."
3,Has pros and cons,"Soft has some great photos and some not great ones. Some are just weird, like a nude woman with a bloody nose. Others are merky and out of focus. Some are well done. Kern's work is just hit and misses."
3,Nice unconventinal art,I purchased this book after a glowing review from a Men's magazine. It is quality art of atypical women doing the mundane daily routine. It is interesting but did not evoke any real emotion from me.
4,Good,Not very sturdy but it works and fits very well. It's easy to put on which is awesome I have an injured arm and I always struggle with all the other ones.
3,***WARNING*** Alot of tracks are recorded from vinyl!!!!,"Unfortunantly I realized this too late...almost half of this album sounds like it was transferred from vinyl to mp3 format, with alot of needle scratching in the background... i would assume that this is why you get so much music for the price. There is a great variety of dub material, so its a shame that the quality of most of the tracks are effected by scratching and popping, otherwise this is a great compilation."
5,Finally a Great Americana / Folk CD,"Stephen Ashbrook's Navigator CD is the Best of it's kind since Blood on the Tracks!!! The Lyrics are story telling in nature, and seem to relate my my life too. So Simple, Ashbrook is accompanied only by his acoustic guitar. This artist is the next David Grey, but with a voice that will carry him a lot further! This record is at the top of my collection."
4,"Old-school biography of Jefferson, Calhoun and Davis","Terribly out of date, but engaging nonetheless, this little book runs a quick biography of the three greatest Southern statesmen before the Civil War. Not too useful for keen insights into character, the book (originally published in 1912) is a sincere attempt at objectivity for its time. And since the author was closer in time to the lives of the characters involved (particularly Davis), his writing reflects a respect and intimacy with these men rarely seen in modern scholarly literature. Read for fun, not for research."
4,Another unofficial book...,"I love the fact that there's unofficial merchandice on the Moffatts, but sadly these books tend to have some faulty information. So it is with this book. However, it has a lot of background information about their past and what they did before starting to sing pop/rock, and lots of nice [and adorable] pictures.The author did most of her research online, and the book lists some fanpages URLs, most of which no longer exist. Makes me wish she'd written it during the great Moffatt domain phase, she'd have had tons more info to write about, and hopefully it'd have been more correct as well. Can't have it all though.Overall a good book for any fan, just beware of the faults."
1,The Seven Secrets of Becoming a Multi-Millionaire,"A very disappointing book. His numerous stories make up the majority of this book. I have the audio book on my Ipod and found myself skipping section after section of this audio book. As mentioned earlier in a review he talks about investing in ""America's Best Companies"" and never tells you what those companies are. I would not recommend this book to even a basic or new investor."
2,So so,"It's a panel of 7 millionaires, that come from diferent backgrounds given their opinions. There is just a couple of valuable tips, but nothing really meaningful. The problem with this is that there is no real depth. The person in charge of the dialogues rushes through and does let them give their full opinions.I would probably skip this and get some real advice from somebody that actually gives more explinations or teaches this.There are a lot of well know books that are way better than this."
5,Randy Ingermanson Does It Again!,"The continuing tale of Rivka and Ari is a page turner! In this, book 3 of the City of God series, Randy goes all out with well-reseached historical facts, fast-paced action, and realistic characters that makes the reader truly believe they're back in time on a fast roller coaster ride! Well done...the book is awesome! For more of my reviews, visit my website at www.robinmillerbooks.com"
4,can't put this book down once you start reading,Very good book-couldn't put it down once I started reading it. I read the first two books & loved this once just as much as those. Arrived quickly & in good shape.
2,not comfortable - plastic bristles poke scalp but they do hold hair,"I have fine, thin hair. Thought this was just what I needed to blow dry daily. bristles are clear plastic and poke out at least 1/2 inch. The brush works, but is fairly cheaply made, and the bristles are just annoying to me. They scratch, are very stiff and poke my scalp when the brush is rolled against my head.I would NOT buy this again."
3,not impressed,"I'm Asian and has very straight hair, so maybe it's just me, but it didn't do much for me"
5,Comprehensive,Great book for a new canary owner. Explains why your bird may be molting and what is good to feed him and how to house him. Has some health problem information as well. Also would be good if you hope to breed canaries but I don't so I can't speak in detail about that.
5,The Canary Handbook,"I recommend this book for anyone interested in canary care, breeding, history and much more. It is very informative."
2,adapter review,"This adapter doesnt work for the inspiron 600m,in the sense,the laptop said it cannot recognise adapter performance.it didnt charge my battery."
1,Run as fast as you can!,"This game is AWFUL! It wouldn't matter if the game had better graphics or more challenging levels because Tiny Tank wows you with witty one liners like ""I've fallen and I can't get up"" and ""Bye bye noodle head"" while you play! This game is fun if you enjoy the type of supream pain bad games like this can cause. Oh yeah, watch the intro - it's bizarre."
5,red bed skirt - great buy!,I am very pleased with this bed skirt! It looks great with the quilt/sham I bought from Target. Casual but classy. love it!!
2,Hard to get into. . .,I understood this to be a historical novel. I found it disjointed and somewhat confusing. Character development was varied; names were unfamiliar and required back-checking to get the correct character. I was generally disappointed.
4,Like new,"The book I purchased used was in very, very good condition. I am pleased to have Amazon as a resource for used books. It was also delivered in a very timely fashion. It came to me in just a fews days."
5,A Relatively Undiscovered Gem,"I first became aware of ""The Leopard"" in 2000 when the Folio Society (a wonderful book club) included it in its selections for the year. Their edition, with its fine wood cutsThe Leopardremains the edition of choice.I put it away, and only took it off the shelf when a friend who is fluent in Italian said, ""Read it.""While I don't generally enjoy historical novels, this one is well worth reading, perhaps because it was written by the Leopard's great-grandson, and thus came across as being more authentic than others of the ilk.Make no mkistake, this is a great book. After you read it, consider watching the movieThe Leopard: The Criterion Collection(starring Burt Lancaster) and then readMidnight in Sicily: On Art, Food, History, Travel and la Cosa Nostra, all very satisfying."
5,Pure grace,"Don Fabrizio is among the most likeable, hubris-ridden characters in literature. Getting to watch the prince grow old with such grace, to follow two love-sick kids as they chase one another through unused palacial rooms, to hear revolution in the distance - these are extraordinary literary experiences that elude sappy sentimentality and escape regional borders. The unified Italian flag rises slowly throughout the book but, at it's deepest point, the novel has no nationality ... hmm; it sounds like I'm descending into sappy sentimentality. In that case, listen to all those brilliant folks hiding out in talk-show audiences when they say, dump this zero - me - and get yourself a hero - Don Fabrizio ... Kick this blurb to the curb and get yourself a real writer (Lampedusa); Truly, this novel's dividends are incalculable."
5,A Perfectly Written Novel,"I think it's safe to say, that for anyone who has read this book, the general concensus would be that every word of this riverting novel is 'perfectly placed.' There are very few books, Marquez's 'Love in the Time of Cholera' being one of recent memory, that can rank alongside this novel of private despair as the 'Leopard' watches helplessly, yet with grace, as his entire lineage crumbles and transforms before his very eyes.Without disclosing any more of the content, this is a novel we should all read, not only for its extremely accurate historical value of a decaying Sicily, but in appreciation of the author's complete devotion to his craft. It is unfortunate, as is often the case with those we consider 'great' artists, that di Lampedusa did not live to realise the success his novel would achieve."
5,One of the greatest books I've read,"The ideas of this book - the passage of time, idealism vs. pragmatism, responsibility - are truly universal. The beauty of its imagery is pervasive. I can't find a better word to describe it than ""timeless""."
3,Love Nesbo but this isn't his best......,"Love Nesbo and have been a huge Harry Hole fan since the beginning. He's a very complex and entertaining character. I waited for The Leopard to be available on Kindle for a long time but finally ordered the hardback when I couldn't stand it anymore! Turns out, it is about 7/8ths of a great book. Nesbo kind of jumps the shark at the end and I got whiplash from all the twists, sputters, and restarts. It's still an enormously entertaining read - I couldn't put it down until the last few parts when I was started saying to myself ""enough already""!"
5,Raw foods = Healthy mind and body,"Whether you are very knowledgeable, somewhat knowledgeable or just curious about the benefits of raw foods, this DVD is for you. This DVD is loaded with information that will change the way you view your health and wellbeing. My 77 year old father watched this video and had this to say: ""I wish I had known this information before my surgery."" The author conducted intensive research which revealed results that are considered revolutionary in the twenty-first century. I strongly recommend this DVD to everyone."
5,This is the Green Smoothie Classic,Victoria Boutenko (the original creator of green smoothies) presents her argument as to why it is so important to add greens into your diet. This argument is a convincing one to say the least. I thought that this dvd explained the concept of health and green smoothies very well.I gave it a 5 star rating because the information is priceless!
3,You'll need a sturdy rope to suspend your belief,"It was a fun read, but seemed to me to fall apart completely in the end. When asked to explain the motivation for some implausible actions by the culprit, the best the detective can come up with are some lame suggestions and the admission that, ""who knows 'ow 'is mind was racin'"". Who indeed.And there was a character who was apparently thrown in simply because he had been in the earlier books as he serves no purpose in this one other than to help explain some of the workings of early train service. A good bit of this sort of thing in the book.This is the only book I have read in this series. Not too bad if you are looking for a quick read and like spot-the-allusions. A disappointment if you were expecting a mystery."
2,Videographer,"I made again the mistake of purchasing a DVD from this couple, this time because I did not read who were the producers.Mi first error was the DVD about the Red Sea, on which I already wrote a review. This is is not as bad as the other one but definitively all the works of these producers (as you can red in any review of their collection) can be classified as Home Movies; some fairly good in this category although others are just for laugh. They manage to advertise very sucesfully but at the end they will barely sell any product."
2,Super basic,"I'm an ACE-certified personal trainer and was looking for some good information and new exercises to use with my client who is in their 60s. This book took basic strength training exercises and had a picture of a senior doing the exercise. Nothing in this book was new to me. If you are a physically active senior, this book may be all right for you. If you are a senior who has been sedentary or who is looking to improve upon daily activities of living, this book may not be right for you."
2,...Horrible.,"The hype is what made this album so bad. The album had so much hype, it was so long awaited...and then it turned out horribly. The songs are beat. For a great vocalist sure did make a bad album..."
4,BASED ON A TRUE STORY< YOU CAN SAY YOU REALLY KNOW ME,"A rather good cd. Songs like ""how many times"" and ""saturday"" are very good. Why did she release ""gangsta"" i don't know. that song stinks. The album is a must buy, and what i find is so cool, is the outro, where she says ""because this is the the end, don't mean it gotta be over, we friends now"". lil mo is a talented singer however what's with releasing the album 1 year after the first single. Ta da was out since summer 2000."
3,no need to purchase this import,You don't have to buy the import. those two songs are on the regularUS version
4,"A Hot, Rising Star, With Lots of Potential!","This CD is pretty good, for a debut. It shows that Lil Mo has a lot of potential. Her voice is very powerful, and she knows how to use it. She wrote 12 of the 15 tracks included on this album. Has mostly midtempo tracks, with the exception of the Cyndi Lauper cover ""Time After Time"". Mo didn't write any of the ballads on here... so she hasn't really begun to start experimenting on her own with those. The track ""Player Not The Game"" feat. Carl Thomas is one of the highlights. Midtempo with spanish guitars in the backround, nicely done. Coulda done without ""My Story"", which although nice, is pure filler. All in all, Lil Mo is showing that she has what it takes to make it in this industry. The second album is gonna be better, after a little more experience she will be a very polished artist. But pick this one up too, if you're in the mood for some from the heart R&B jams. No lyrics included, which is a downside as well."
2,A Little Diappointment,"Considering the length of time that Lil' Mo made us wait for her album to be released, I was a little disappointed. I mean we all know that her first single ""Ta-Da"" was bangin'. Then we were all yearning for more. It took almost a whole year for her second single ""Superwoman"" to be dropped. When I bought the album I was expecting something........I don't know.......INCREDIBLE!! Don't get me wrong the album is good, but I think she made us wait too long for it's release. I guess I got my hopes up too high. Anyway, she sounds better on other people's joints. Maybe her sophomore will be better."
4,So-so,"I like the fact that it has a hip-hop kind of ""Dance to"" beat to it, but she missed the lyrics part!!"
4,The voice of the Streets!!,"If streets could talk,its voice would be like Lil' Mo vocals and its words would be like Lil Mo lyrics.I never lived on it but i think Lil Mo knows exactly how is it...She's a kind of rapper girl that doesn't need to use a dirty mouth to express what she feels,and also doesn't need it to make Rhimes.She can be the next LiL Kim but she has something that kim doesn't own:class!!"
1,CD,I was very dissapointed because the CD was scratched and the last 3 songs do not play. I will not purchase another CD from AMAZON
3,IT'S COO,"Lil' mo's CD is something that u can sit back and relax to. her best songs are ta da, supa star and sturday. but there is others that are just as good. ofcorse there are other songs that can bore you. but she is a talented young lady that has to sart somewhere and then go from there."
5,Love this one!,First of all Allrecipes is fantastic. And this hardcover rocks. Cannot wait to get cooking. Like the hardcover.
1,TOO SLOW TO USE,"I was really looking forward to getting this player for Christmas, but after less than a week I returned it, it's way too slow to use, there are extremely long pauses between songs and it freezes constantly, not to mention the 1 navigation button on it has to be hit in just the right way or it doesn't work, the menus are a pain too because you can only browse songs by filename and you cannot make playlists on the fly, Creative really dropped the ball on this one"
5,Best reference guide ever.,"I have been tending ""high volume"" bar for thirteen years. Over those years I have trained dozens of bartenders. This is the best reference guide that I have ever found on this subject. It is the only book I use."
5,Top Gun on the Bar Guns!,"Buller's book opens like a bar book should. Spiral bound, it lies flat for easy reading at the bar! Great tips even veteran bartenders can benefit from. No bull here - just common sense approach to ""tending"" your ""stage""."
5,So warm even in humid conditions,Live in South Louisiana where its 27 deg and 80% humidity and all I need is a short sleeve shirt under this and I am good and toasty. Very good in rain and wind.
5,Junie B. Journal,I bought this for my daughter's 7th birthday and she loves it. She has read all of the Junie B. books and the journal is in true Junie B. style. I think it would be a great tool to get kids writing.
2,Book was written in!,"According to the details of this book it was in very good condition. Well, a diary that was used up, by that I mean was totally written in on every page, in my mind is not considered ""VERY GOOD BUT POOR CONDITION."" I feel I was deceived by your description of the book and even though it was a used book it should have been disclosed that the pages were written on. I have a very sad little 6 year old Granddaughter who will now be getting a brand new book to replace the junk you sold me. Thanks for nothing! I will make sure in the future that any book I purchase will not come from Blue Cloud Books!!!"
2,I hate giving such a wonderful journal such a low rating!,"I would LOVE to give this the full five stars. My daughter has been very balky about handwriting, and this journal has been exactly what she needed to help her speed and concentration. It's great to have such a wonderful motivator! HOWEVER - this really ought to be a spiral-bound book, so that the pages can lie flat. That would make it far easier to write in. I'm going to have to have this precious thing re-bound somewhere because it's falling apart."
5,YAY!!!!!!,"This book is like, really, really fun to read AND write in. I got mine a few years ago, but I want to do it again, so I'm buying another one! Most people would think I'm a little too old for Junie B., but no one can outgrow Junie B. Jones. I still collect the books, and I read at least one Junie B. book a week. I recommend this book for kids 5-9. I'm over the age group I just mentioned, though! Buy this fun, hilarious book! You won't regret it!"
3,But how do you figure that?,"I have read the book and give it 4.5 stars...but the abridgement of this work goes just a bit too far. George Guidell does bring life to his characters, but far too much is edited out (e.g. the burial of gold in Eddington Smith's courtyard) as well as other crucial or circumstancial events that allow the listener to deduce whodunnit. In the books I can usually follow along and have a satisfying ""Aha! I KNEW it!"" sensation, but this particular edition of the tapes leads the listener all bewildered down the garden path, and it is difficult to figure out HOW Qwill comes to the conclusions that Koko is trying to convey to him."
4,Pickax Revisited,"If you are a fan of Lilian Jackson Braun, you will enjoy the latest in her series of ""The Cat Who"" series. In this episode, Qwilleran and his friends are baffled by the series of fires which are being set in mineshafts and businesses around Pickax. There are also two seemingly unrelated murders. While Qwilleran and his clever Siamese Koko are attempting to solve these mysteries, we become reacquainted with the lovable characters which Braun has created. Qwill and his friend Polly participate in several interesting social events including a caravan to all the abandoned mine shafts. The citizens of Pickax are trying to get in all the fun they can before The Big One (first snowstorm) hits and they are snowed in for several days. The solution to the mystery is almost overshadowed by the interplay between these well-drawn and interesting characters."
4,Excellent Book in the famous mystery series,"This is one of the best books in the series. But it shouldn't be the first one you read. It doesn't give a lot of background information for the first time reader to understand what is going on in the novel. All in all it was one of her best yet. Even with the help of the two cats I had no idea what was going on until the very end. If you are a fan of the series you should definitely buy this book. But if you have never read a ""Cat Who"" book before this isn't for you. Buy an earlier novel in the series; then buy this one."
3,"Quill's women get ""Catty""","I absolutely love ""The Cat Who"" series and have read all 23 in the series. The latest ""Cat Who"" however was severely lacking. This book seemed to skim over details such as meals, settings, conversations etc., that in the other books made you feel like you were a part of the action. I found myself turning the pages back in many instances, to make sure that I had not skipped a few pages of dialog. I was also shocked to find that most of the women in this book were portrayed as being very jealous, catty and shallow! ..."
3,A book with a lot of character,"I am a fan of 'The Cat Who' series. This book is a celebration of personalities and old wives tales. The mystery is almost secondary to the colorful characters that populate Moose County. I loved the 'waiting' for the big one, the snowstorm that will usher in winter with a bang. It was almost like waiting for Godot. In an odd way I felt worse about the destruction of a bookstore than I did about the murder victims. While I do not think this is the best in the series, I did enjoy it. But as some on the other reviews on this page have suggested I would not recommend it to a reader new to the series. I would suggest they start with an earlier book. But for fans like me who have read them all this is a must read book."
4,All the usual elements are here.,"THE CAT WHO SMELLED A RAT is more than satisfying. I recommend it for the many Braun fans out there. She once again brings Moose County and its citizens to life. And the lovely cats! I love to visit Moose County. It's the perfect vacation for me! I can still see in my mind the picture of the robins. Here Qwill and the gang are at the Indian Village condo again, waiting for winter to come. I hope you're reading these in order!"
3,Good for Cat Who Fans - light on the mystery,"If you are a ""Cat Who..."" fan, then you'll enjoy the latest installment. I always look forward to the latest Pickax happenings, because I enjoy the characters in the small town. The mystery is usually an added benefit. This book met with my expectations. Lots of juicy gossip around town, and a mystery thrown in. Somewhat predictable, but an enjoyable, quick read. If you haven't read a ""Cat Who..."" mystery before, I would start with one of the earlier ones. Then you will appreciate the characters more."
2,disappointing,I can't wait for a new book in this series to arrive in the library so I always buy the book as soon as it hits the stores. I could have waited on this one as it was very disappointing. Maybe Qwill and the cats need to go on a visit Down Below as this series needs a new direction.
3,Not the best CAT WHO book,"For some reason this book was slow going. As a matter of fact, I dare say it was a bit...boring. I have read every cat who book and I was very dissappointed with this one."
1,junk,"i new that is was a gamble for the low cost but thought that i would give it a shot....first thing i opened the case and one was REALLY bent, got caught when the case was closed at the factory. then i noticed some of the other tips were dulled from rubbing on the inside of the case. still i tried a few others...couldn't get a clean hole even with a drill press...sad really they are just useless...would give it 0 stars"
2,Terrible,"Bits are cut very rough. They have lots of nicks and scratches. Not acceptable for woodworking, I've returned them.The case is a joke. Can't get into it, once pried open the bit index will not flip open. Dismal."
4,Sparse on the smaller size bits,"These bits have been working great for me, my only complaint is that the sizes seem to be a bit of a funny selection for a set. I'd prefer to have more bits towards the smaller end and fewer of the larger sizes."
4,good set,"I have barely used these yet, but so far everything is going well. i needed bradpoints, and these fit the bill"
1,Inferior Product,"These bits are inferior in manufacturer. They will appear to wobble when in the drill, however, they are actually not straight (appear bent or curved). This can be verified when rolling a bit on a flat surface. They cause oblong or misshaped holes when used. My first set had a problem, the replacement set was the same. Guess I got what I paid for."
5,Excellent Instructional Video,"Though the equipment used in this video is a bit out of date, the tactics and advice provided are something to be appreciated by the modern day hunter. Hugely informative and less showing off, I wish more hunting videos shared this same quality of content."
3,Amalfi Coast?,"I like the TimeOut guidebooks. However, I should have done my research at a local bookstore before buying this one. I specifically was going to the city of Amalfi. There's very little mention in this book. The book was, however, very helpful in getting me to Amalfi (which is not as easy to get to from Rome as I had originally thought!) I will no doubt continue to buy TimeOut books but I'll make sure ahead of time that they have the information I'm looking for."
1,Leave it home,"Extensive historical background, which is useful before you get there; but not a good guide for things to do and see or places to eat. Other guides are better for carrying with you for on-the-spot reference, such as where to get a meal near where you are. I'll use it to prepare, but won't be taking it along."
3,Who do you believe?,"Not a bad book, just a little ""spotty"" on the details. ""Tom"" is vague about his on/off membership in the S.A.S. and who actually is asking him to go to Afghanistan. The British papers are now revealing that out he never was in the S.A.S. After hearing that, the rest of the story has to be taken with a grain of salt. There are better books on the S.A.S."
2,Good story (fairy tale?),"I liked the book. I am a former member of a Special Forces Unit (not the SAS) and can say that many details of military conduct are correct. The author has knowledge about this specific topic. The book is entertaining, regardless of the question whether the story is true or faked."
4,A good read !,"Definitely a good read. This book provides detailed insight into the planning of covert operations in Afghanistan, and some of the problems associated with dealing with the indigenous population of that region. The book is not centered around actual battles fought, but focuses on the day to day aspects of the operation. I would definitely recommend it for anyone with an interest in special forces operations."
2,A Work of Fiction,"In response to various stories in the British press last fall, the Ministry of Defense eventually confirmed that, despite statements made in this book and in interviews, Mr. Carew had never been in the SAS Regiment. Presumably the rest of the experiences in the book are just as accurate."
3,Average,"I read this book in the spring of 2001 and at the time I was somewhat interested in a war that I did not know a lot about. Given the events post 9/11 it would be interesting to reread the book. The book was ok, it offered some interesting facts of the British Special Forces operations, but it did not provide a good overall view of the conflict, country or people of Afghanistan. There are a number of books now coming out about this conflict and part of the world that would probably offer a better overview. If you are interested in British Special Forces then this would be a good book for you."
2,Read all The Reviews,"This supposed guide to the ""jihad"" or holy war was a complete bust. Mr Carew (if that is who he really is) has duped us into believing that this book would serve as an insightful look at the war in afghanistan during the 1980's. It in fact is nothing but a poorly written story of one mans exploits as a so called operative for the SAS.Mr. Carew bored me to tears with his self indulgent back patting.Save your money!"
2,The game is totally unrealistic,"I am a huge Michigan State fan, and with the exception of three players, the entire roster is wrong. Some of the players have numbers that actually exist on MSU's team, but they are the wrong color, play the wrong position, and their ratings are all wrong. Also, the game is way too easy. For instance, playing on the second most difficult setting, I led Kentucky at halftime 55-2, and Mateen Cleaves had 45 points. All you have to do on the game is wait until their guard gets in front of you and then you reach behind, steal the ball, and dunk it. I was extremely disappointed."
2,Not a Great Game,"After renting March Madness 2000, I was very upset in how bad that game was. I then bought Final Four 2000 hoping it to be twice as good. I was wrong. This game is the easiest game I've ever played. My 7 year old brother beat Michigan St with Harvard 93-4! How can that happen? Also, the graphics aren't as updated as they should be. A final negative thing, is where did they get the rosters. I was playing with my favorite team, Stanford and some of the starters had never played on the team. They got a lot of the players numbers wrong. Overall this is not a quality game."
1,Ups and Downs,"This installment of the Final Four series is the same thing as last year except the part where they have Trajon Langdon walking around everywhere. Playing against Junior is too easy, but its impossible to beat Senior unless you are incredibly talented. For example in a 20 minute junior game against FSU with Florida I won by 117 points. Yes 117. Not 17, 117. In a 10 minute game against Utah State I won with Florida 99-15. Yes 99-15. At half it was 53-4. Yes 53-4. Against a great team like Michigan State I still won by 40. Finally, Quinn Buckner is just as annoying as in last year's game."
2,This game [is bad],"Okay, the graphics are disgusting. The game control is horrible. It's physically impossible to block a shot, and you can never fail to steal the ball. Shooting is the worst thing in the world. The only thing that makes this worth 2 stars and not 1 star is that it has so many teams in it. I would give it 1 and a half stars, but that's not available. I would not suggest this game if you want a game that's even halfway decent. I'm glad I only spent [little money] on it used at [a local retailer], because I threw it out after 20 minutes of play."
3,Lots of teams but not a whole lot more,"This game is pretty disappointing. I'm a big fan of the 989 NCAA Gamebreaker and thought this would be of similar quality but it's not. The graphics are ok, but could be better. Rosters are pretty inaccurate, and the game doesn't play very realistically."
5,Great New Talent!,I thought that this singer is awesome! I especially liked Angel eyes. Definately going to make it somewhere!
2,It's a renter,"I bought this game about a year ago. I'll admit, yes it was fun. For the first half hour. The game is a little too simple for this player, but maybe a younger gamer might enjoy it.I'd rent it first before considering the buy if I were you."
2,Fun if your under five.,"I played this game and thought the premise was alright, but they just didn't do anything with it. All you do is run around a preset track and jump over obstacles. You really don't even have to steer, your character follows the course when you don't do anything. A supreme waste of money. DON'T BUY THIS GAME."
5,Stalin and his regime destroyed the revolution,"In the introduction to his book the author writes: ""In Stalin's times there was so much manipulation of pictorial material that it is possible to reconstruct the history of the Soviet Union on the basis of retouched photographs."" This sentence summarises the real essence of the book."
4,A Tavern Full of Rock and Roll,"Picture the Archies if they were veterans of 10,000 bar gigs, but still sounded as sweet as cartoon pop rock. These guys clearly have a history, with a dose of after 1970 Byrds, Replacements and more than a little Rubber Soul Beatle-pop. Heard these guys for the first time on a country radio station in Farmer City, Illinois. Not a pure country play though-more of a hard drving, hook throwing bar band than any one genre.I docked them a star for possibly appealing to Grateful Dead fans.Editting 7 years later...Really like this album, lost it for more than a year, couldn't find a Replacement, then a buddy found one for me in California. Great comments by some nitwit claiming he couldn't hear music like this in Central Illinois, as above, this beauty was first heard on The Whip, WWHP, in Farmer City, Illinois, CRACK YAW!"
4,"Catchy stuff, Highly recommended","This album is real catchy. The vast majority of the songs 'work' with only a couple of flat songs.Throw the late 80s/early 90s Minneapolis sound (Replacements, Gear Daddies, Jayhawks, Soul Asylum, Run Westy Run) into a blender with Wilco and the mid-period Beatles. The result is the sound of this album.There are no soaring or poignant moments on this album. If you are looking for catharsis or beauty or an uplifting experience, this album doesn't 'do that'.But as I said before, this stuff is darn catchy and a real good listen. And you gotta like an album that contains a song that asks the all-important question:""Who shot the cherub?""It wasn't me."

1,Dubious Scholarship,"Gardner's book is one of many that is specious on these subjects of Jesus' and Mary Magdalene's offspring and their secret succession over the last two millenia. If you enjoy this kind of book, I suggest you study magic and con games of the Jon (?) Edwards style. As you communicate with the spirits of dead people from history, ask them if they know anything about this nonsense.I.e., do not take this book seriously, and be careful. Gardner is cited as an authority in other books of this ilk.And for God's sake, before you make up your mind on these kinds of pop authors, read Umberto Eco's novel, _Foucault's Pendulum_. Eco knows a great deal about these secrets-revealed purveyors.If I disappear, you-know-who got me.John Doenz"
5,Best explanation yet,I found this to be the best explanation of the bloodline of Jesus as well as the best explanation of the bible and religious history I have read to date.
1,poorly constucted,The book seemed a logical follow-on to the Jesus Papers..The beginning had promise but the writer seemed to loose the thread and my interest.
3,"A Stretch, But Interesting None the Less","I, like many others, got interested in the whole subject of Jesus' marriage and children, possible cover-ups etc... after reading Dan Brown's ""The Da Vinci Code"". I made the mistake of making this the first book I read about the subject. This is one of the more radical books out there, so I would advise anyone interested in all this to work up to ""Bloodline of the Holy Grail"", after they have already got a foundation of what they believe from some of the more level-headed and fact-based authors. (N.T. Wright's ""Who Was Jesus?"" is a good one.)After further exploration of the subject, it has become clear to me that many of the claims made in this book are based on half-truths, assumptions and exaggerations. However this book also has its rare moments of enlightening fact. I would recommend this book to anyone able to discern the enlightening fact from the obvious fiction. ""Bloodline of the Holy Grail"" is worth investigating, but don't make it your new Bible."
4,A review of the greats of tennis,This is an interesting review of some of the greatest tennis players who played at Wimbledon and who compiled great records. I would like more tennis and less talking.
5,"Excellent grinder, excellent coffee!","I love the 'portion control' that puts the right amount of coffee beans into the grinder, and that it shuts itself off when it's done grinding the beans to the fineness I select.In the past, I had used a mill grinder where you put in some beans and hold the top down to grind - I never really knew how much to put into it nor how long to grind the beans. The Capresso 555 takes the guess-work out of it. The ground coffee is perfect - not a mix of big chunks of beans and fine powder that I'd gotten from my mill grinder.People have mentioned that it can be 'messy', but I've found it much cleaner than my old mill grinder. The instructions say to tap the ground-coffee container to reduce static electricity when you remove the container, and I've found this works very well. While I sometimes get some ground coffee on my countertop, it's no more than I get when I'm using pre-ground coffee and measuring it into the coffeemaker."
2,"Happy with the grinding, but not the grinds catcher","I'm happy with the quality of production of the coffee grounds (no comment on the quality of espresso grounds - I'm not educated enough on proper espresso to speak on this). Every once in a while, I place the grinds catcher/container in the top rack of the dishwasher (on low temperature) and it has not held up. I've replaced it twice (throughout occasional use for a year and a half). The first time, the bottom fell out and I super glued it back on for a temporary fix. Once that came apart again, I replaced it with the second container - which cracked and leaked ground. When I eventually replace this unit, I'll look in a higher price bracket in hopes to find a better quality construction. Aside from the grounds container, I'm satisfied with the unit. All coffee grinders I've had experience with are a bit messy."
1,Poor PErformance and LEaks,"This grinder was a disappointment. It did not grind evenly, it spread coffee out of the side when grinding. Most importantly it was not able to produce fine grinds for an espresso machine."
4,great grinder,"This burr grinder works great. If you take the grind container and put the filter over it (#4 cone filters fit nicely), then turn the container and filter over together, NO COFFEE GROUNDS END UP ON YOUR COUNTER!It does take a few steps to clean afterwards (why I took away 1 star), but it's worth the trouble for the perfectly ground coffee.It IS curious that noone has come up with a static resistant plastic or coating for these types of applications, but I am hoping that when the weather gets more humid, the static will reduce. But either way - I have used this grinder 5 times, and only once did I get ANY grounds on my counter - and that was because I didn't read the directions first. Highly recommended."
4,An aromatic mess,"There's good news and there's bad news here folks. The good news is that this machine consistently helps creat a fine, fine pot of coffee. The bad news is it's a mess, even by male housekeeping standards. Ah, but what a wonderful smelling mess. The kitchen is filled with the aroma of fresh ground coffee that carries one away to a kinder, gentler world, reminescent of cold mornings, wood stoves and a good farm breakfast. Worth every penny, and then some. The measured dosage does not seem to agree with the Cuisinart measuring spoon, but one learns to add a notch or two depending on grind. The espresso grind (2) is perfect for me, the daily brew grind of 7 is also consistent and works well with the gold tone filter. Once again though, if you are a ""neatnic"" you may be in for a surprise."
4,Great Grinder,I am very pleased with my Capresso Burr Grinder. I use it daily with great results. Only have one complaint; every once and a while I don't turn the portion control dispenser just right and too much coffee is ground. Oh well... This is a great machine that gets the job done.
1,Blade broke in twenty months of light use,We typically brew a pot of coffee a day and grind more than half of it at the store before we bring it home. For the coffee beans that we brought home we used the Capresso 555.01 Burr Grinder.This morning as I was using the 555.01 one of the metal blades that grinds the coffee broke off rendering the machine useless. Wouldn't you know it comes with a twelve month warranty so we're SOL. I would avoid this grinder and find something that is better made.
4,This is a great burr grinder,"I like this product very much. I make espresso everyday with this machine. My only problem is the fine espresso makes a bit of a mess when pouring it out of the container. I tried using the scoop, but that makes a mess as well."
2,Can't Deal With the MESS!,"I've owned this grinder for about six months and had read thereviews here prior to purchasing. Though I agree with thequality descriptions of the grind, the mess drives me Whacko!For filter coffee I'm back to using my seven year old bladegrinder and only use this burr for espresso. Clearly there are still some design issues left."
5,An Excellent Gift for the Thinking Man,"If you know a thinking man who has everything, this is a great gift to get him. It worked for me."
5,"Accurate, informative but easy to follow",Schama's series of programmes is a first class version of British history offered in an easily digestible way. He has his own take on the subject and frequently reveals perspectives which are not normally considered.
1,Unforgivable lack of closed captioning!,Once again the History Channel disappoints with the lack of closed captioning on documentary DVDs. Closed captioning is not especially difficult on dramatic productions but failing to close caption a narrated ducumentary is ridiculous and simply unforgivable. I am disgusted by these products.
1,Very Disappointing,"With anticipated glee, we bought this DVD series as a Christmas gift for our family; however, as we went through each of the 5 DVD's, we became increasingly disappointed in Schama's ""history."" So much of his presentation seems to be ""on the fringe"" and not central to the mainstream of the basic history of Britain. Also, as others have pointed out, Schama seems intent on presenting the ""gore"" of battles, tragedies, etc. He also seems fascinated with sex and the eccentric too much. We just felt that we were not getting the fullness of the basic story of Britain's history. It was very disappointing, and we would not recommend it."
2,Superficial.,"It is not about Britain but about Simon Schama [however the last hour of Volume 5 is interesting]. If you still have some doubts: just compare this documentary with Mark Twain by Ken Burns or Thomas Jefferson also by Ken Burns, and judge by yourself."
2,A rather uninteresting and pretentious overview of Britain,"I purchased this series with high hopes and I found viewing it to be very disappointing. The host was annoying the images added nothing to the presentation and there was way too much time spent looking at peacocks and flowing streams.I suppose that the history would have been OK if it weren't so scanty. This was very much a quick overview, which often left out key facts that would be vital to understanding the motivation for actions in later parts of the series.I commend the idea behind creating a good series in the history of Britain, but I can only suggest that this one be avoided at all costs."
2,Style Over Substance,"This series boasts purple pretentious prose delivered bobble-head fashion, rather than real history. It's like an impressionist cook sampling a smorgasbord of other people's food. A self-indulgent little nod here, a little tweak there, and no substance. I know this is geared toward entertainment, and the bits on Alfred, the Edwards, and the Henrys are good, but we're disappointed. Instead, get theMonarchy Complete Collection, even if Starkey has the same wobbly ways, his narrative is far less florid and far more informative. I highly recommendA History of Scotland. Schama's approach places a modern lens over the past, rife with scewed views and a glaring lack of focus. Schama skips over the the heritage of the Saxons, the fascinating and complex War of the Roses, the Reformation, and so much more. Someday, I must actually read my copy ofEcclesiastical History of the English People (Penguin Classics)."
4,Not a Typical History Book,"This is a different type of history, with more emphasis on the individuals concerned. The author narrates the story, in a somewhat sardonic manner, but with an emphasis on the people involved, not just the dates and places. Some of the players are well-known, but he also brings up some of the more obscure players, who never-the-less influenced history.We enjoyed it. Each part is about 58 minutes long, so they fit rather nicely into a TV schedule."
4,Simon Schama: A History of Britain,"I gave this product only 4 stars because I heard no mention of the Celtic migration into Britain. Since the genetic makeup of Britain is reportedly primarily Celtic, this would seem to be a significant omission."
3,The History of Britain,"Excellently done except: there are no captions, and the dialog is drowned out with musical instruments, making parts next to impossible for those with impared hearing to understand. What a pity."
4,"Great series, irritating labeling","Excellent series. Did as well as someone can with 2500+ years of history and only 15 hours to tell that story. The labeling reference is to disks 4 and 5. The Disk 4 label was on the DVD with Disk 5 shows, and vice versa: Disk 5 label on DVD with Disk 4 programs. I figured it out after a quick DVD shuffle, but it was an irritant with what is otherwise a great product."
2,Biggest hair brush I've ever seen!,"I didn't realize it, but the ""3"" in the title meant that the barrel diameter is 3""! So the total diameter of this brush with the bristles is 5""! I can't imagine anyone needing a brush that big. Other than that, it looks to be a nice brush, just be forewarned about the size."
3,"Brush bigger than expected, hard to handle!","Although the brush was what I wass looking for, it is so large in diameter - I can't use it - I am not sure if I overlooked the size in the post but I can't seem to find it - anyway, a beautiful brush but way too big."
4,Sultry Country,"If you like the sexy, sultry style of early Tanya Tucker and the underappreciated Deborah Allen, then be sure to pick up this CD. Miss Rose possesses a powerful voice with an actress's sense of shading. And she's easy on the eyes."
4,Great Sense of Place,"Faye Kellerman has written an extremely interesting novel set between the World Wars in Munich, Germany. Axel Berg is a Munich poice detective charged with solving a string a serial murders involving young women. In the backdrop is the rise of ""The Austrian"", Adolph Hitler, and the atmosphere is one of growing intolerance for Jews, Communists and any other group not associated with the Nazis. This is an excellent book that is actually a story within a story."
2,Yuck,"I usually love Faye Kellerman, but I found the violence and sexual content of this book un-necessary and disgusting. I didn't even finish it. I could not connect with Berg, he was not interesting and her attempts to show both the good and the bad side of him as a person simply made him look like a boorish jerk who cheated on his wife and couldn't even do THAT with passion...frankly, Berg was boring, boring, boring. I didn't complete the book, and I'm no expert on German culture or language, but I'm not in the least surprised that there are errors in the book....her book Moon Music had several cultural mistakes as well (she tried to take on Mormonism...and she failed) I wouldn't bother to pick up this book...hopefully she'll go back to Peter and Rina soon."
2,Text to speech not turned on!,"Book was good but this is her second book after Stone Kiss that doesn't have text to speech turned on. Thats too bad, most of my books I listen to on the way to work since I drive at least two hours a day. The text to speech is a great option because I can read at home or listen in the car. I rarely buy the book if this option is not enabled. Not sure if I'll go any farther in her series."
4,Not your usual Faye Kellerman,"If you grabbed this book because you were looking for something along the lines of Decker/Lazarus, you made a mistake.The book is dark and brooding. Her hero is no saint, actually none of the characters are saints. Based on my grandparent's recollections of pre-WWII Germany, Kellerman described the atmosphere in Germany to a tee.For me, the actual story was a side-line. But if you're interested in the History of Germany at it's most crucial time, then this book is for you."
2,The History Was Better Than The Convoluted Story,"While it's apparent Kellerman used a great deal of research in writing this book, the story-line never fulfilled my expectations. The plot was complex to the point of being tedious. What made the novel even harder to embrace were the heavyhanded descriptions...descriptions that were repeated and repeated and repeated. As were the deductions exposed by the characters.It was also hard to care for protagonist or any of the other characters. True, these were horrific times and the murders depicted in the book brutal. But the prose was both boring and plodding.If only the novel was as intriguing as the book jacket and the subject matter."
2,The Dollar Store has better peanuts than these,"First of all, I didnt get what's pictured. My impression is that they wont ""randomize"" what you're supposed to get. I got the pistachios(the white looking nuts in corner). Salty and bottomost ones were stale. Section 2 were the cashews. They were great, no problems. Section 3 were SUPPOSED to be salted almondsd from the picture. Did I get that? NOPE. I got sugar(aka honey) roasted peanuts. Horrible. Stale with a slight sweet taste and bottom ones were like somebody poured sugar all over it when it was wet. And Section 4. See what's in that picture, the one that looks like mixed nuts brittle? If you want to call some VERY hard, rocky ""version"" of honey roasted peanuts as ""mixed nuts"" from the picture, then it's time to close the shop down. Did business with Ole J&D's, but will NEVER buy this again. 1 bad product tried is another business that could've done better......."
3,ONLY WORKS ON LAPTOPS NOT OTHER DVD PLAYERS,DVD ONLY WORKS ON HUSBANDS LAPTOP TRYED 3 OTHER DVD PLAYERS WONT WORK FUZZY SKIPSIS WASN'T QUOTED TO ONLY WORK ON LAPTOPS DISAPPOINTED...
2,Not like their original recording,"I loved The Limelighters, and when I discovered they had their original recording out on CD, I purchased it and enjoyed their incredible energy once again... Then, thinking that I would get the same sound as they poured forth into their first record, I purchased this CD. Their first big hit, ""The Hammer Song,"" the first recording on both CDs, just didn't have the same sound on the more recent recording --- in fact, it sounded as if they had sung it for 100 nights in a row and were just doing it one more time. The other songs on the album were OK, except for one in which they were actually off key. . . For uplifting music with spirit and zest,I really recommend the Limelighter's original recording."
4,"Slower songs, but still good","If you prefer some of the slower-paced praise songs, this is for you. Almost all are down-tempo. Very beautiful compilation, though. Good for easy-listening, sunny afternoon."
2,"Great Coffee, Poor Construction","Worked great! Loved the thermal carafe, but from day one, noticed that the construction was a bit flimsy. Sure enough, the lever that opens the drip valve when the carafe is inserted broke right off. It was a thin piece of plastic and it looked as if it had been weakened by the heat of the coffee.Fortunately, we were able to exchange it for a different brand."
4,told with insight and humor,"Ralph McInerny is one of my favorite mystery writers. A philosophy professor who has taught at Notre Dame for forty years, he is a noted scholar whose novels reflect his knowledge of the vagaries and virtues of the human heart. In ""Triple Pursuit"" we are again in Fox River with Father Dowling, his staunch housekeeper, Marie Murkin, and his pal Detective Phil Keegan. This is a marvelous yarn whose theme might be ""cherchez la femme."" Once again McInerny treats us to the interior lives of characters large and small, like the pretty young mother, Jane, who looks forward to private morning time after her husband is off to work and her children to school; or to the aging priest who continues to serve a parish despite nearly crippling arthritis. McInerny is a mature fiction writer who writes equally well of women and men, something that cannot be said for a lot of younger male writers. Kudos to him for this latest novel, and may he give us many more to enjoy!"
1,wrong item,amazon needs to do something about this company...I too ordered the night light with the extra outlet by glade and was sent only refills....what gives...how can they still sell out of stock items.....
2,Starter for tasting the literature about New Orleans,I have read most of the full works highlighted in this anthology and thought that the little tastes were like getting a bite of a Muffaletta and nothing more. For someone who has not ever read New Orleans writers this is nice place to start but it isn't for someone who wants a bigger taste of the city through its literature.
5,Very touching,"Anyone who has a sibling can relate to this book. The plot is one of the oldest around; sibling rivalry. However it is so masterfully told and interwoven with shaman myths that it becomes a completely original work. It is wonderfully written. I found myself rereading several descriptions in the book and wondering how the author came up with it. (I read a lot of books and this is not normal for me.) Just a quick example exerpt...""There was only a cold dread that had started to creep in, like the tendrils of fog that were rising in the chamber of trees, the damp clouds of his own breath.""Anyway, unlike some books, the characters aren't just skin deep. They are skillfully carved out and then brought to life. I highly recommend this book."
2,Confusing...,"I wanted to like this book. I really wanted to enjoy the strange characters but in the end (and I assure you I struggled to finish it) I still disliked it.First the trees. Why were they so evil? That was never explained, save to say that they wanted their king back. Ooook why then?Then Vetch and Clare. Two potentially deep characters who soon became flat, bitter and confusing. Their love/hate relationship could have become interesting but it was turned into some sort of rivlary.Lastly, Chloe. What a cruel and evil little girl. She never tells anyone how she feels and then runs away to another word to be queen. When her loving brother tries to rescue her she blames him for not getting any attention and then almost kills him. Yeah, can someone say psychopath?"
4,Lexmark X8350,"I purchased this all-in-one mainly for the copy and fax capability. It has preformed perfectly in that capacity. This is the easiest all in one I have ever used, navigation is very intuitive.The foot print is small for what it does.It has become my main printer.P.S.Check ink prices out on Amazon."
1,No Linux Drivers,I'm using Linux (ubuntu) at home.I contacted Lexmark support and they said they have no plans to support linux users.Which means you have to be a Microsoft customer to use this printer.If you have any vague plans to move to linux (e.g. don't want to pay for a Vista license) stay away from this vendor.Too bad. I wish I hadn't bought this printer.
4,Good,Well I like that printer. Its great. Mine got a little damaged in the mail but its all good. still works. :)
1,beware Mac folks,"I gave it one star because not allowed to give no stars. I have been buying printers for over 20 years and never thought to check on printer compatibility with first my Apples and later with my Macs. This is the first time I've purchased a product that was not compatible.I had to send this back because it doesnot have drivers for Macs. I think this should be made clearer in product info. I did double check with the Lexmark tech support, before returning and they confirmed the lack of compatibility"
3,"Good info, but organized by disease","I like the author's information, but do NOT like the way she organized it alphabetically by disease. I want to read about herbs when they are listed by themselves alphabetically. I'd like reference to be made to ""all herbs that contribute to immune boosting"" or ""all herbs that help the body fight fatigue"" also. I don't want to read about every disease in the book just to find out which properties an herb might have. I dislike the organization of this particular book."
5,Very Informative.,"I was pleasantly suprised at how easy it is to garner information from this book. Quite informative, and extremely interesting. Very helpful for someone who is wanting to become healthier in a natural way. I would recommend this book."
3,Prescription for Herbal Healing,"I bought this for my brother's graduation from Pharmacy college - for reference to the world of herbal medecines sold in most retail drug stores and health food stores. I was disappointed in the book - it did not include some of the remedies I have tried for my IBS and candida. Also, I was hoping for information on how much/how often to use the herbs/oils/powders, etc. I would have exchanged it but needed to give my brother something for graduation party."
5,Great reference book,"1st part herbs and what the are used for. 2nd part, conditions and what herbs may help. Easy to use, a cool book. Oddly I don't think it mentions Oil of oregano anywhere! I'd still pick up a copy."
4,Love this book,I love this book and have her other book 'Prescription for Nutritional Healing'. I love the breakdown of the herbs and would recommend this book for beginners looking to learn about herbs.
5,Great Book,"This too is a great resource tool. I take herbs and vitamin supplements as preventative medicine. This book tells me how to take the herb, describes the different forms of the herb, and tells me the best way to use the herb. In addidtion, it lists the cautionary measure - if there are any related to the specific herb. These herbs were used in the remedies that my Mother, grandparents, and great grandparents used. It worked for them then, and they still work now. Thanks for adding to my health education through the ""Prespcription for Herbal Healing."" Another great resource tool for my library."
5,Prescription for Herbal Healing,"Purchased this book and its counterpart, ""Prescription for Nutritional Healing"", by Phyllis Balch. Very useful information for those conscientious about non-drug remedies."
1,Dissatisfied,"I had higher expectations after reading the reviews. I prefer The Encyclopedia of Natural Medicine or God's Medicine Is Best by L. Wise, also some publishings by Dr. D'Adamo would make a better choice. Too many remedies for one problem it gets confusing. I like simple advise that works."
2,healing book,not what I expected and not as useful as was advertised. Very hard to find the correct information and I believe there is a lot of information that could be in this book that is not. Disappointed if I spent more than a few dollars on the book but for just a few bucks used and shipping I am sure I will get my $7 total out of the book sooner or later.
2,Over rated,"There are better books.The book is also promoted on the author's worthless credentials... had I realized she her ""degrees"" were not from accredited sources, I wouldn't have bought anything she writes."
1,Bad,"This is more a biography with a preachy pro-veganism PETA like tone and one, yes just one, funny cartoon, the one on the back with the snowman,the bunny and ""their"" carrot."
3,"sometimes brilliant, but often arrogant.","Dan Piraro is undeniably one of today's most talented newspaper cartoonists, and there's much to enjoy in this overview, if you can get past the tiresome, unrelenting narcissism and vegan proselytizing. More art (there's room on the pages) and less smug self-righteousness would've served this book better (and I AGREE with most of Piraro's politics)."
3,"A long, intricate, violent, feat of imagination","If you enjoy a lot of description and back-story coupled with a very elaborate imagination, this is for you. There's a lot of violence, a lot of long paragraphs (half a page for a single paragraph is typical) of detailed description and a lot of dialogue. There's action too, but the proportion of dialogue and description slow the story down - hence the nearly 700-page length.This author sometimes writes poetically and his imagination and capacity for detail are remarkable. But halfway through, I almost felt like giving up, discouraged by the amount of violence and the slow unfolding of the plot. I don't think I'll read the next ones in this series; it just required too much patience and I caught myself wondering why I was subjecting myself to a story this complicated and violent."
2,Dune Comparison,"Many, arguably most, of the central elements of this book are are ""borrowed"" from the classic science fiction novel Dune.Mother a witch with supernatural powersSon results from forbidden mating of royal father and beloved concubineThe ""super being""/savior prophesyThe mysterious drugThe downtrodden people secretly more powerful than their opressorsBaron Harkonnen = Regent StoggulFor my eight bucks, can't I get an original plot?"
1,Disappointing,"If you want fantasy from EVL, stick to his Sunset Warrior Series. EVL started out as a fantasy author before writing popular fiction such as his Ninja books. Initially I was glad to see TROFD but it isn't a very good fantasy book and in to comparison to the Sunset Warrior series, it [is]like a black hole. Find his earlier fantasy work in a used book store and don't bother with TROFD."
1,"Run away. Far, far away.","This was a painful book. Overall, it was melodramatic, with very poor charachter development. The plot was irritating at best, rather overblown by the author's fascination with peculiar inter species romances."
1,Waste of time and space,"This is the worst book I have read in a LONG time. Everthing about it is bad, I can't believe I read to the end, I must have been stunned that this #### made it to become printed."
1,So Silly I Couldn't Suspend Disbelief,"Eric Van Lustbader's ""The Ring of Five Dragons"" is definitely not worth reading. In a nutshell, the characters' behaviors are sometimes just silly, the writing stilted, the magic system undefined to the point where its use is nonsensical, and some of the major plot mechanisms are jaw-dropping unbelievable. I rate it at a Bad 1 star out of 5. Don't bother."
2,long winded and not reader friendly,"The first thing about this novel is that it could be cut in half at a minimum. There was so much unnecessary, extraneous information. The characters did not fell real. The story was convoluted. In the world of the story, the Vornn are the invaders who have taken over the planet inhabited by the Kundalan. Despite this, the Vornn male seem to have no interest in the females of their species, but are overly enthralled with every Kundalan female on the planet. The story line is so convoluted that I can't even succinctly explain it. It does, however, involve a ring and the fate of the planet. The part that really lost me was when the main character, a Vornn male transforms into a Kundalan female. Yeah, exactly. Not to mention that if I see another word with three consecutive same letters, I might have to scream. This book is not worth reading.Carl Alves - author of Two For Eternity."
1,Wrong parts,I ordered the filters they said were for my engines and they were the wrong ones. Now I must send them back.
4,It's a Memphis Thang,"If you can imagine Dick Dale on steroids or the Ventures in a frenzy, then you have some idea of the sound that comes out of that scratchy guitar from Memphis. Wammack does to a guitar what Jerry Lee Lewis does to a piano, he plays the hell out of it. His music predates the ""Surf Guitar"" of the sixties and although the Memphis influence is there, it really sounds like nothing you have ever heard. He is virtually unknown outside the Memphis area. I heard him live at the Memphis Fairgrounds in '64 and ""Scratchy"" made me want to Rock 'n Roll, Twist & Shout, get down and get FUNKY!.....and that is a Memphis Thang."
5,Kick Ass Guitar !!!!,"When producer Roland Janes sent a copy of Scratchy to Chet Atkins, Chet sent it back with a note 'This scares me. I pass.' Here's the original version of Scratchy and 20 other incredible Chet-scaring tracks including Night Train, Scratchy, Karate Time, Tech-Nically Speaking, Distortion Part 2, Hideaway, Up-Set and Fire Fly. A must for all Rock & Roll guitarists !"
5,A Father/Husband on Bereavement,"Lisa Donner went through all the treatments for breast cancer. She died at the age of 36 leaving her husband Chris, the single-father of four. This is the story of her battle and his family challenges.Confronting the Cow offers hope, understanding and consolation to caregivers, cancer sufferers and their survivors. This is a very nicely produced book and a great tribute to Lisa. DanPoynter@ParaPublishing.com"
3,Great but where is the Pen?,"My daughter loves the Personal planner but was hugely disappointed when she opened it and found there the pen shown on the box is not included and we can""t find one at Toys R Us, Target or anywhere."
5,Excellent Book,"This is an excellent book. The author does an excellent job in describing the essence of Christianity, placing the reader in the actual history of Christianity, and also placing the reader in a position to look at the future of Christianity.The book is well written."
3,Bought it for a college class,I appreciate Hans and his stance. The book has a lot of good information but it is a hard read.
1,Extremely disappointed!,"Eugene Fisher described Kung's previous work on Judaism as ""more [about] Kung's opinion of Judaism than Judaism itself"", and the same description could be applied here with respect to Christianity. What makes it all the more sad is that his recently published 'epic' is nothing more than a re-hash of earlier ideas and bitter polemics with very little content that is new or original.In this book more than any other, Kung comes across as a very bitter old coot with a perpetual axe to grind against the Magisterium -- to such an extent that on several occasions I had to suppress the urge to throw the book down and scream ""ENOUGH ALREADY! GET OVER IT!""In the end, I traded in Kung for Ratzinger's ""Introduction to Christianity"" -- which turned out to be a much more satisfying and substantial read and which I heartily recommend."
5,Spectacular!,"This de-luxe box set covers Jerry's Sun studio years from 1956-63, and include EVERY song that 'Killer' recorded in that period: all in all 246 songs with 30 unissued performances in perfect sound quality- all tracks are mastered from the original tapes.If your tired of countless 'best of' compilations with always the same songs in not so good sound quality, this is the nice solution. And trust me, it's a great music (Jerry is really the wildest and most rockin' star of late 50's and early 60's) in a great package, and after i've heard all 8 cd's, i was just breathless. Yes it was that good!"
4,Annoying Announcer,"This game has good graphics, sounds, and is somewhat realistic, but easy. I don't think the AI is quite as developed as it could be, but I'm not programming it. The stadiums and players are well rendered and the fight songs add to the realism. The only major problem is the announcer. He has what seems like less than 10 things to say during a game and it gets very annoying after a few times through. But other than that, I highly recommend this game to the football/college football fan , or anyone for that matter."
4,Grudge Match,"Having one friend go to G-Tech and the other to UGA it's an ongoing battle in my house. They change the stadium, weather, skill level and even players for their head-2-head meetings. Myself, I'm a Big East person, so I'll play anyone, but we all agree this game is a blast. Also, having a good selection of plays always makes for interesting moments. The only thing I would change is to give Keith Jackson a co-commentator."
1,Pathetic Product,"I purchased this AC adapter for the same reason I purchased the prior two I've owned in the three years I've owned my current laptop computer; those two from different vendors. The black wire casing on the three prong end of the wire breaks and exposes the bare wires underneathe. I thought this one would not succumb to the same problem. But in less than one month from purchase it did. We can send people to the moon but we can't make an electrical wire that stays intact for a reasonable period of time!I would not recommend this product as it feels ""cheaper"" than the other two I've owned plus it suffered from the same problem alot faster than the others. It's junk."
1,"If you can't do it, teach it.","You'll get plenty of score settling, chip-on-my-shoulder attitude, but precious little in the way of good business advice.This is what the author has to say about ""the vampires at the top"" (p. 43):""People at the top are accountable for everything, but responsible for nothing. Day-to-day they do little actual work. They meet, they plan, they strategize, they pontificate, but they don't sit down and actually produce anything. It's as though they feel that the only way they can earn their hefty salaries is by piecing back their businesses after having smashed them to bits.""One for the bargain bin."
3,fairly good,"This book is straight-forward and readable. But its strength is also its weakness. Lennon admits to his foibles and past mistakes, that makes him seem human and his advice accessible...but the fact is a lot of his mistakes are ones a lot of people would NEVER MAKE IN THE FIRST PLACE, so don't have to be told not to do this or that. I'm naturally tight-lipped, for one thing, so don't have to be told to keep my cards close to my vest, etc. But a lot of stuff in here is useful, and I mildly recommend it as a book to supplement other business books you should read."
5,Smartest book of the year,"This is one of the best ""how to behave in business"" books I've ever read. Lennon's style and ""lessons"" are for everyone. His common sense and keen wit are refreshing and right on target. You will not regret reading this one! It is terrific and very, very enjoyable. I can't wait to see what he'll be writing next. Keep an eye out for this talented young author!!!"
2,Biblical Grounds Shaky,"Almost every reason Ronald Nash gives for the wholsale saving of babies (and the like) goes against conservative Christian Dogma. One obvious example is his statement that babies are 'sinless'. Well, sin has nothing to do with the REQUIREMENT of belief in Jesus. 99.999999999% of heaven's occupants are/will be massive sinners. This all boils down to what has been referred to as the 'Exception' or 'Exemption' rule. I can come up with about a dozen logical exceptions to the 'belief' requirement. Unfortunately we on Physical Earth will not know until we depart the physical."
1,Was not comforting,"Someone gave my husband and I this book after the full term loss of our second baby. Fortunately, I had read other much more comforting books on the subject of pregnancy/infant loss before opening this one. I never completely got through this book, it was a theological discussion and not comforting. I needed to read books written by people who had gone through loss, who were offering comfort and support.If you are reviewing this book because you have lost a precious baby. First, my heart goes out to you. It is a devastating and soul-wrenching loss. Secondly, I would recommend my two favorite books on the subject: Silent Cradle and A Deeper Shade of Grace. In both these books the authors share their personal stories of loss, healing and hope."
5,Much Needed Theological Answers,"I will start by saying I have not lost a child, but I am constantly asking for theological answers to what happens when children die. I have 3 children and am constantly worrying about them passing before they come to know the Lord. Baby baptism does not assure heaven. I know that sin separates us from God, and that all of us are born into sin. Therefore, I needed theological reasons why I could feel safe in the Lord if my young children were taken from me. I know God is a good God, but that is not reason enough for me to understand the theology behind this book. This book really gave me some much needed answers. I also recommend, ""Where is My Baby?"" by Nancy Ferrin for a more comforting view on the loss of a child."
2,Get Spyro 3 not this one....,"Arg! Playstation One games give me a headache. I bought this for Christmas after loving the Spyro 3 game. This one, well, let's be honest...it is boring. It is confusing. The graphics are not very good (but, hey there are worse ones). As we play I find it hard to control and see what Spyro is doing. Overall, this rates about a 2 or 3. I think if you want to spend less than 20 dollars, get Spyro Three...it is really, really funny and much easier to follow. I find this Ripto game is sort of a beta version of the much more enjoyable Spyro 3."
2,Spryo 2 Riptos Rage,Its not nearly as good as the first one. Lands are to hard to find and its hard to figure out where you're going and where you have been. No logical order. Very displeased with this game.
5,Spyro was my favourite childhood PSX game.,"It's probably the best Spyro game in existence next to the first game. The music is great. The locations are great. Everything is just great. I love you Amazon, thank you for letting me relive my childhood with this awesome game."
2,"It is ok, but the First is Better","I rented the first game from a neighbor of mine and I loved it. It was challenging and fun. Then when this game came out, I was a bit disappointed. The graphics and controls were the same but it was TOO EASY! I beat the game in less then 4 days of renting from Blockbuster. If you like short, sweet, and easy games, this is for you. If you are like me and want challenging games, I recommend getting either Final Fantasy 8, Syphon Filter, or Metal Gear Solid."
4,Cute!,I purchased this game for my kids. It was one of the best things I have done in awhile. They love it!
4,it's ok!,"This game is kind of good but not as good as spyro year of the dragon!But still this game kicks of spyro the dragon from the shelves!It's has better graphics,good sound and cool boss.Pros:good graphics 4/5 starscool sound 4.5/5 starsnice music 3.5/starsbetter boss then before 5/5 starscons:dont have any but the game is 2 shortAs you can see that you migth want 2 rent the game first but if you already have spyro year of the dragon you migth want 2 skip this game 2 spyro enter the dragonfly"
4,Spyro 2,"I thought spyro 2 was good,but it was WAY too easy!I also thought there was going to be dragons in the sequel,but found orbs instead.The sequel to this game needs to be a lot harder than this"
1,A HORRIBLE game that i wouldn't recomend to my worst enemy!,"If you like to watch a purple dragon running around and trying to fly you will love this game! But most people don't like that so DONT BUY IT! If you must see it rent it first, then decide."
5,awesome game!,"This game is the best sequal I have ever played, it has awesome graffix and if you liked Spyro the dragon you'll love Spyro Riptos Rage!You should definitly buy this game!"
5,Spyro burns the competition away!!!,"This was a fun game. I wanted to get this one because it looked cooler than the other spyro games. I tryed it and it was great. I especially like fighting the boss rounds. I give this game five stars for its graphics, entertainment, and durability."
3,Bought it for the kids.,"Bought it for the kids. They can play it for hours on end. Me - I can't stand it! The levels are all basically the same and so it gets repetitive in hurry. Kids will love it, adults will get bored quickly. Makes a great Christmas present for the kids!"
5,Better Than the First,The second Spyro is even better than the first one. You get more power to make this action game that much more fun. It is great for kids or adults.
5,Spyro-even better the second time around,"This game is great. It has everything-exciting worlds to complete, puzzles to solve, shooting, flying, swimming, the whole nine yards. It is far more challenging and entertaining than the first game. The graphics are good, and the characters and story are interesting, but above all, it is a fun, well-rounded video game."
3,"C'mon , songs are good but production is lacking!","These guys have done great songs but the songs contained in this CD are very badly produced, the sound is distorted and poorly arranged, of course they are demos, but for a good Keel fan I strongly recommend Larger than Live, that's real Keel music."
5,Of the four Minnie Riperton compilations...,"... available, this one is the BEST! The quality is excellent and the tune selection is superb! It's a *sweet* Minnie Riperton... definitely a ""Perfect Kiss"" via a ""Perfect Angel"""
3,Needed volume booster,"It is a good rendition of the Orthodox Hail Mary, but they needed to up the sound when they were recording it. I had my MP3 on maximum volume and was barely able to hear it at the gym."
3,King of Tame,"By the name of this video, you might hope to see the top pro-skaters battle it out at a skatepark comp. for the title and the cash. Needless to say ""side-show bob wanker"" Ellis hosts this unmotivated group of ""nobody really has time for this"" videos. The show kicks off with Danny Ways' insane trickory of pulling a 65' launch air into 18'3"" vert air - sick. Things slide off after that. Mike V., Hawk, Rowley, Koston and Burnquist follow up with thier own dreamed up stunts. You are given a bio. on each boarder which slows the pace down a bit, but the music saves the action from flat-spotting. Burnquists' ""top off the loop"" front side air gives everybody the run for the moolah, in this ""cool if it was for free handout like t-shirts and stickers"" DVD."
5,A compilation of selected novels by a master science fiction,"Dimensions Of Sheckley is a compilation of selected novels by master science fiction author Robert Sheckley, and include several of his works which had fallen out of print. All these terrific stories are collected under one cover and newly accessible for the discriminating science fiction connoisseur. The novel and novella titles comprising Dimensions Of Sheckley include ""Immortality, Inc."", ""Journey Beyond Tomorrow"", ""Mindswap"", ""Dimension of Miracles"", and ""Minotaur Maze"". An informative introduction by Mike Resnick and an informed afterword by Tom Gerencer round out this mind-bending collection of future worlds ever-so-slightly askew from the evil realities of the present. A classic compilation by one of the most gifted science fiction authors of the 20th Century, Dimensions Of Sheckley is a ""must-read"" for every dedicated science fiction enthusiast!"
3,short stories better,"Sheckley wrote short stories for a while before he figured out that the big money was in novels. I am a total fan of his short stories, and totally recommend the edition of his collected short works that was released at the same time as this version with his novels, but the novels... well, I don't like them as much.For me they tend to be a bit too surreal-- too much time devoted to quasi nonsencicality for my reading pleasure."
5,Thrilled!,"My older daughter received this as a gift for her second birthday (Jan 2007) and by the summer had mastered steering and the gears. My younger daughter, one year old, also loves to go along for the ride. She sits in the passenger seat and gets to control the radio! I love that it's an adjustable two-seater with seatbelts. They both love riding in it and I feel it's safe and durable. We have big rocks/boulders around the edge of our yard to keep cars off our property and when she was first learning to drive would occassionally crash into them. At most the car got a scratch or two and she was fine. We actually plan on purchasing another one for the baby next summer so they can ride together! I would highly recommend this toy for hours of fun!"
2,Stranded in New Orleans,"We bought this car for my daughter and she rode in it 4 times before it left her stranded on the side of the road! The gears stripped in one of the wheels and it had to be towed home by daddy. She's under 40lbs, so rule out any thoughts that she may be too heavy for it. It is a really cute car with realistic details and she loves the ""red"" convertable look of it. Unfortunately it's back to the store in less than a week, not durable enough for the high cost. We are very disappointed."
4,My daughter loves this car,"My husband and I bought this as a christmas gift for our three year old daughter. It was very easy to assemble, and there aren't too many stickers. The look is pretty authentic and my daughter is quickly figuring out the steering. Our only complaint is the rear wheels spin a bit with her as the lone occupant. This was mentioned by another reviewer. But it is still an awesome toy, and I'd buy it all over again."
3,Background music needs help,"I'll give it 3 stars because it's good for giving you ideas and progressions. However, the majority of the music sounds like gospel music with the organ being so strong, especially at the end of the riff. Many of the riffs are shown as ""mid tempo minor blues, jazzy blues, blues waltz, etc"" for a variety. But in the end the background music could use some work."
1,This is an advertisement,"I have been fascinated by all the ads for the Healing Codes. I have often thought of spending the $800 for the program, but have been held back by the substantial investment. When I saw that there was a film about the healing codes, I thought that this would be an opportunity to learn more. As a result, I ordered the CD. All I did was pay for an advertisement. The Healing Codes are still a well kept secret."
4,Very Enlightening,"This book gives great and I mean GREAT scientific data on the way your immune system works and how quantum physics plays a role in emotional energy stored in every cell of your body. I felt powerfully enlightened.As a follower of Christ and a believer in prayer this book became scientific evidence of the healing power of prayer. BUT...if you do not believe in a supreme being you will not like this book.The problem is that even though I was so excited to begin my own healing code, I fell off the wagon after three days. If you are a dilligent, faithful, disciplined and committed to healing buy this book.I wish I were better at practicing the healing codes regularly. I can honestly say that I noticed a difference when I do them consistently."
5,Fun!,Children love them. They are fun to read. Great book for a young child that likes colorful fun books. s
5,Wocket in my Pocket.,"What else can you say, another great book as always from Dr. Seuss. Great addition for our little ones collection."
2,There's a Wocket In My Pocket,When I ordered this book it was listed as hardcover with a price and under this was board book with another price. I payed for the hardcover one but received the board book. I think this was disceptive. i could have ordered the board book elsewhere for much cheaper.
3,Not What I Thought It Was,"This was my favorite book as a child, so I wanted my son to enjoy it too. However, it's not the full length book. It's a small board book for toddlers. I was disappointed when I received it, but my son likes it and thinks it's a funny book."
5,It helped with those scary house noises,that seem so loud in the dark. Now we just try to decide which one of his characters is making the noise. My little one thinks the artwork is really neat.
3,I didn't realize Dr. Seuss didn't illustrate this.,I would say this book is alright but it is really missing that something special without his illustrations.
3,In a Peoples house,I thought that this book was ok because it teaches little kids what is in a house and what you should look for if you were ever in a different and or strangers house.
4,The Little Engine That Could,I thought this nook was cool because it shows liitle kids that if you thry hard enough you can acomplish what you want to do and maybe even be able to set tweo goals.It also shows that the impossible is possible.
4,I love the silly rhymes,The book is fun to read to my 10mth old. And the book can withstand him chewing on it
4,nice,This is a good read and quick.The pictures are humorous and rhymes are as always enjoyful to read.
4,Great book and silly in a fun way,"We really like ""There's a Wocket in my Pocket"" because it, like several Seuss books, is very silly. However, what most appeals to us is how the book is designed to teach your child the names of things in the household by providing rhyming ""clues."" For example, ""there are nub boards in my ... cup boards.""My child really enjoys being able to complete the sentences, and this book is in her top fifteen."
3,Kids get a kick out of the silly nonsense words,"Kids love the silly, made-up words in this book by Dr. Seuss. It is appropriate for the youngest listener because there is no story to follow, just pages of rhymes. As a parent asked to read it night after night, I'd recommend hiding it after a few days, or you will lose your mind. However, this book, and other Dr. Seuss books like it, are very useful for teaching the concept of rhyme. It also lets kids know that inventing characters and words is fun."
5,It was great!!!,"When I was in America, this book was my favorite. Right now, I live in Japan, but when I was in America, my best friend and I read it together.This book will always be in my heart. AF and YI"
5,Used but like new,Obviously this is a great classic book. It was a used book tehcnically but in absolutely perfect condition - seemed new.
2,not one of the better seuss,my daughter does not care for this book. i think it has to do with the obsered things he calls things. they are also hard to pronounce.
2,Too nonsensical even for Dr. Seuss,"I bought the board book for my 1 year old, but when because he is still trying to identify what is a horse, a cow, a chicken, etc. these pictures and nonsensical words just add confusion. I suppose this book may be good for phonetics exercises at an older age, but I don't really see the humor in it. MUCH better Seuss books are Mr. Brown Can Moo, Can You? and Dr. Seuss's ABC."
2,Not interesting.,I found my baby (who is 13 months old now) totally not interested in this book at all. It is one of the books that I wish I did not purchase.
4,"Speaking Acapella, it does not get any better than this","Even with the high cost of the import, any true music lover will appreceiate the talent here, especially given the choices in new music these days. I am amazed these guys have not been picked up by a major US label. There range is incredible. Their music is in the same vain as The Nylons. On a couple of songs they get a little too glitsy, almost as if they can't make up their minds what type of songs to sing. On many songs their voices are the showcase and this is where they truly shine. An excellent disk! Do not let the cost scare you off, you will not be disappointed."
4,Interesting arranging on this CD,"At first I wasn't sure what to think about this CD. The intro was what I thought this album would be, but it went in another direction. Interesting tracks, all written by other people. Don't get me wrong I do like this cd, but it does take some getting used too. I will continue to buy the rest of the imports to hear how they progress."
3,A vision of a real nightmare,"I confess that this is my first Herta Müller novel, and I was at first pulled in by the strange lyricism of her voice as well as the obliqueness of her symbolism. This is the story of several young people, living under the totalitarian conditions of Ceausescu's Romania. After the suicide of their friend Lola, each of them leaves the countryside to try out life in the city. However, things turn for the worse in this desperately dark, stifling presentation of life within a police-state. Admittedly, Müller's narrative eventually spirals into repetition and loses the initial force of the first half of the novel. Still, clearly the work of true talent."
5,Nobel Prize for Literature,"Herta Muller, the author of ""The Land of Green Plums"", won the 2009 Nobel Prize for Literature. In his remarks announcing the award of the Nobel Prize to Muller, Swedish Academy president Peter Englund characterized this book as the best of her works."
2,Nobel Prize Winner?,"Our book group read ""The land of green plums"" in November 2003. We thought it was pretentious and very badly translated. I don't want to denigrate the translator, but it seems to me that he may have had very poor material to work with."
4,gorgeous,"Highly recommended, especially for those interested in understanding the effects of a government, in understanding differences (and sameness) in countries other than the USA or the U.K.Unfortunately, Amazon.com did not protect my book (I live in Australia). By the time the book arrived, the packaging had been ripped open, the spine of the book in tatters, pages marked with an unknown black substance which is so disappointing. If I wanted a second hand book in fair to poor condition, I would have bought one. My brand new book - before arriving at my postal address - is a sad and sorry book. It looks as if someone set about to harm it - sad especially knowing the story of the book!"
3,A vivid nightmare,"Great book ! It is probably a very interesting book for people how have not lived under comunist regimes. For those who came from such countries it is a very vivid nightmare that we tried to forget. Some things though should not be fortgotten, no matter how painful. She was a minority in a comunist country, she always had the hope she would get away. Imagine the romonians who had no hope, nowhere to go. Probably that's why she keept her sanity, hope. Merry Christman to all, read it after the holidays. Dan."
5,the absolute best,"This is the type of recording that can make your clock radio sound like a high-end multi-thousand dollar piece of equipment...it's that good! There is NO better jazz recording, nor will there ever be. Get all three sessions of the rare and genius pawn shop recordings. If you close your eyes, I promise you that you will be transported to Stampen pawn shop, be able to squint your eyes due to the smoke-filled venue, and taste the beer. You may also notice that the loose change in your pocket is missing...Get this record, it is the last record you will ever own. Forget the top 500 Rolling Stone list. This is magic. Do you think I'm recommending it? SIX STARS."
3,Works because it's about Bigfoot.,"If it wasn't for the fact that the DVD is about Bigfoot, it wouldn't be worth the buy. The DVD has poor sound quality and effects that should make you laugh...not what I expected for the price. Don't expect anything from the title either... It sounded like a great Bigfoot DVD I could turn the lights off to and get creeped out! Not the case. On the upside, the DVD contains some great ""first encounter"" stories from folks who claim to have seen Bigfoot. If you're a true Bigfoot fan, take the plunge and buy it. Don't expect too much!"
2,Disappointing,"If you are a Sasquatch researcher I could imagine this documentary to be pretty interesting, but for the average curious layperson like me it was pretty boring - just a bunch of interviews. Yawn!"
1,Don't waste your money,This is just a collection of stories from questionable witnesses; nothing for the serious researcher here. The DVD I received kept locking up and had to be restarted. Save your money and pass on this one!
4,Pleasantly Surprised!,"Before I purchased ""Eyes In The Dark"", I wasn't really sure what to expect. A couple of the people who reviewed it here panned it and other said it was better than larger-budgeted Sasquatch Documentaries.When I started watching it, I was immediately impressed with what Mr. Partain did with a meager budget. The eyewitnesses and Sasquatch Experts he assembled were very well done. The reenactments of the witnesses' encounters were well done.I would have liked to have heard more about Mr. Portain's family encounter, though. I can imagine it was terrifying.""Eyes In The Dark"" is a welcome addition to my Sasquatch DVD Collection!"
2,another disappointed,"Im a bigfoot fan, but this movie was very boring, very disappointed. The interviews might have actually been interesting alone if they had left out the cheaply done video of ""bigfoot"" that was of course fake and looked very much so. Also in one interview the guy claimed to have video taped this ""thing"" in heavy brush, well where's that video? If thats true why wasnt shots of his video in this it would have made I BIG difference.It doesnt come close to ""Legend of Boggy Creek"" now thats a movie at least it looked real enough to believe. Nice try though, gave two stars for effort."
1,Anything this bad should be banned in most countries,"What a Blitz wanna-be this is. And it fails miserably at attempting to be one.1. Graphics. Ok, these are laughable. I'm reminded of Atari 2600 games when watching this.2.Sound. Har Har. A 10cent Pc Speaker has a wider range of sounds than this.3. Terrain. You're kidding right ? Everything looks flat and lifeless.4. Plays. Plenty of 'em. And if I could stand to look at this game, I'd probably try 'em all. It's very confusing, however, to try and pick a play.5. Gameplay. Slow, clunky, laughable.Don't buy this. You'll waste your money and time. Glad I rented it first."
3,Parents teens and boundaries,This is a good book although I wouldnt use some of the things I still think it will be helpful
3,"A decent, inexpensive buy.","I bought this DVD on an impulse for less than $10, and let me just say that it's worth every penny. Granted, for those out there who are die-hard anime buffs, ""Chance Pop Session"" won't raise any eyebrows, but it's still an enjoyable ""American-Idol-esque"" tale about three girls following their dreams. At times, yes, it can go a little slow, but the quirky little pop songs quickly become infectious, and you'll find yourself humming to the tunes long after it's done. Take a chance on ""Chance Pop Session""!"
2,"It's like Fame, but lame!","This short-lived TV series was about three up and coming students in a special talent school. They all wanted to follow in the footsteps of their idol, Reika. After dealing with jealous classmates and a pushy partner, they finally get their own gig together. But still alot of problems evolve, as they normally do in overdramtic shoujo anime like this. The major problem that this series has is there are WAY too many musical montages in it, including one scene in episode 5 that almost looks like a live-action closing credits piece. There are other decent anime titles that are about girls becoming pop idols, although they usually include magical pets that transform them Sailor Moon-style into idols! But then again, this series probably could've used some annoying talking cats to make it more interesting. For J-Pop junkies only!"
5,"Of all the books that I've ever read, this book was the best","Never have I come across a book which made me feel what the characters were feeling, and in such a strong way. Vanyel is the very definition of a hero, yet he still shows that he is human and has the same wills and desires as the rest of us. I wanted to laugh with Vanyel and cry for him. Mercedes Lackey has the ability to erase the boundary between fact and fiction, what is real and what is imaginary. Magic's Price is a tragic yet unforgettable tale."
4,beautiful but flawed,"Like the hero, Vanyel, this book was beautiful but also deeply flawed. The violence and destruction done to the hero was over the top and needlessly graphic. However, the characters (except for the garden variety villain) were likeable. I especially liked the relationship between Vanyel and Stephan, his boyfriend. The author made you want to root for them and feel the anguish of each when they were separated."
5,"Exquisite, Excellent, Exceptional","I must have clung to the books for months before I could bear to return it to my friend (who gratiously loaned it to me). I love it, I love it. I can find no other words to describe it, other than Mercedes was wonderful and so Vanyel was wonderful. I cry everytime I reach the end of Magic's Price and I am just so filled with joy when Stefan is reunited with Vanyel. Every time I read Magic's Pawn and Magic's Price, I am struck by the feeling of love that Vanyel has for his lover. And I am left with the feeling that love between two men is so ... I don't know. So loving and warm and ... wonderful. And here I'd like to wish all gay lovers the best and my love always. 'Cos I also have a gay friend whose looking for his Lifebonded. Bless you all and Mercedes Lackey for putting those feelings and emotions on paper so well."
3,Great Story; Challenging Themes; Sad ending.....,"I am a new reader of Ms. Lackey's ""Magic"" series with Vanyel. I am glad that I read all three books..There were too many loose ends in the story for my tastes. In spite of all of that, I still recommend this series to anyone loving this genre. END"
5,Magic's Price is one of Mercedes Lackey's best works.,"In this book, Mercedes Lackey wraps up her brilliant trilogydealing with Vanyel's life. She does extremely well atportraying Vanyel and Stefen as a couple, never making theminto freaks but instead presenting them as two normal people who love each other andjust happen to both be male. She also does a wonderfuljob of showing the stress that even our greatest heroes cancome under. Another thing which hits home is the priceVanyel pays for his power. I've always maintained thatthere is a price to everything, and this is a perfect example of that.This is a wonderful book, and any Lackey fanshould definetly read it. It pulls the reader alongand one soon finds oneself totally immersed in Vanyel's world. Read it."
5,"One man's journey through love, pain and eternal loss.","How can anyone not enjoy the depth and scope of this book and the books in the entire Valdimar series. Misty goes beyond the norm in this fantastic book. Her level of control over this world of Valdimar leaves the reader breathless with antisipation. As with all of the Valdimar books, Magic's Price moves you through all of the emotions. Lendels death and Vanyels ensuing pain puts us all in mind of times when we where in the same type of state. All praise to Misty and long may she continue to take us back to her world of Valdimar and all the fantastic peoples therein."
4,A bit sophmoric but entirely enjoyable.,"Okay, it's certainly not first-rate writing, but it's got a great plot -- as evidenced by the fact that so many people keep on going back and reading more and more of the Valdemar series.A friend turned me on to the Last Herald Mage series as a ""realistic way to portray gays"". It is, and it's very non-prejudicial (self-consciously so, may I add), but it's also an interesting plot once you get into it. The vocabulary and writing are a bit lacking at times, but the plot is where this trilogy in particular shines, and the series in general does well.Another reader critiqued it, saying it didn't deserve 5 stars because it wasn't top of the line -- as evidenced by Tolkien and other leaders of the genre. It's not supposed to be Tolkien -- it's supposed to be relaxing, with a good plot and some wieldy sentence structure and a few typographical errors. It is good at what it does, and it doesn't even attempt (thankfully so) to be Tolkien."
3,Best and worst of the trilogy,"I thought the story was better and more enjoyable than the first two. BUT, it also describes the homosexuality in greater detail.I tolerated the first two because of the tasteful use of ""fade to black"" before any love scenes. This one goes into more detail -- though still tame by ""romance novel"" standards.The worst was the depiction of a gang-rape. Uncomfortable to read.The hero was still too moody and sulky for me and too dense to see the good in his life. Also, too careless in some very important decisions.A reasonably satisfying ending.I'm glad I read it. I will not be recommending it to my children, however."
5,absolutely wonderful,"This is, without a doubt, a wonderful ending to the trilogy. It's heartbreaking, and I cry every time I read the last two or three chapters, because they are beautifully written and sad but happy at the same time. You absolutely HAVE to buy this trilogy."
1,terrible,Had this for 2 seasons now & it still is cooler outside than in next to this air conditioner! I hate it!!!!Do not waste your money!!! Even the air direction louvers do not move as stated!
5,"Exciting adventure book, technically sound, a good read!","When I found this book I wasn't sure I'd like it. Boy,was I wrong! It is a great semi/supenatural adventure story! Being part of the firearms industry and a martial artist I found the action correct and realistic. The story flowed smoothly and logically and still managed to surprise me. I highly recomend this book to anyone who likes this type of genre."
4,Another gem from Dr. Robert Anthony,"This book focuses on how individuals can live their life ""loving"" their work or finding work they love. Life's too short not to enjoy what you do for a living. I enjoyed Dr. Anthony's many insights sprinkled throughout the book and his table or exercises towards the end of the book were very valuable. His ""Personal Progress Chart"" was very helpful and I am enjoying using it. Yes, there is not a lot of original thoughts in here but the true value of the author's insights are reading them over and over again. Let his ideas sink deep into your thoughts."
1,UGH,"Dr. Anthony clearly means well, but this volume was a waste of time for me. It is a loosely organized collection of pithy and obvious observations, anecdotes and truisms. There isn't an original idea or suggested approach in here--in spite of the great title."
5,Good value,"I bought this to keep coffee at my desk. It works great. It keeps hot coffee hot, and it does not leak. This version has the Capresso brand name on it, which appears to cause at least one person to submit multiple nasty reviews of it. If you search for the Nissan Travel Companion, you will see that it is the same unit. There it gets excellent reviews and five stars. I am not mad at the Capresso company, so I will give the unit five stars right here."
1,Don't make the same mistake...,"I brought this stainless steel vacuum bullet to enjoy my hot, wholesome ginseng tea during my long, tedious lectures. From the appearance, this vacuum bullet is very appealing; however don't let this mislead you.Only if they showed the stopper of this vacuum on Amazon. The stopper is poorly designed, and I feel as if Bob from the Wal-Mart auto center was the chief engineer. It has one rubber washer to hold the stopper, which is highly ineffective. Sadly, I didn't get the same vacuum bullet as the previous review; probably he was alittle quick to review -grin-. Well, this was a waste of 20 dollars, so please reconsider. I hardly write reviews, but this product truly pisses me off since more hot tea got on me then in me. -sigh-, I hope I have better luck with another brand."

4,flying fingersThe,"The CD came quickly and well packaged. The music is great. Boy, can he play anything!"
4,Wonderful Designs,This book has beautiful European designs. Not only does it have beautiful designs but also Penlope and Gros Point which is very hard to find in the US. The book has wonderful resources as to where to find uncommon canvas and threads.
1,Featured French Bulldog pattern not found in book.,"Although this book has some nice patterns, the featured French bulldog cushion pictured and discussed in the forward and also pictured among the cushions on the cover of the book was not included among the patterns given in the book. I specifically bought the book to obtain the bulldog pattern."
3,Graham Rust--Dog,"Come on Mr. Rust, don,t put the needlepoint of the adorable dog pillow on the cover unless it is a pattern to follow inside the book."
5,Buy it,"Holy gad, this album is 23 years old and it still sounds like the Future at times. I have a friend who to this day insists this is the single best New Wave album of that era. I'd argue for another by this same group or maybe a Split Enz title (True Colors)but I've always seen their point. Womderful if you love that era and are getting tired of the usual stuff heard on 80s stations. ""Don't Forget the Night"" and ""Galoping"" are probably my favorite songs by this band and are permanently in my Top 50. ""Galoping"" is just one of the most extraordinarily original bits of songwriting ever--music of the future we deserved; what pop should sound like in the year 2095 if we ever get back to having fun."
2,Everything looks cool the first 10 minutes....,"Then your eyes start getting really really tired and you get a headache and when you take them off.....BAM!! it's Blue Spectrum Overload!!!Like going outside after living in a cave for a month.....They're cool-looking but honestly they're not suitable for driving, or any kind of outdoor activity, they end up hurting your eyes plus everything looks weird like an old 60s Movie and you get a headache for trying to get used to the radical change in color perception."
3,"took a minute, but eventually got to me.","there were a few mix ups and some communication problems. it took two days less than a month to get here. and i had no communication with the seller about where the item was, until I contacted HIM 2 weeks after ordering to find out what the deal was. eventually when i got the item, it was in good shape."
3,Not for casual workplaces,"I work in IT, where a suit would make me very over-dressed. I'm always trying to figure out what the female equivalent of the male uniform is (button-down shirt, slacks, and dress shoes). This book was more helpful than ""Dress for Success"" (pictures and modern examples), but not as good as ""Casual Power""."
5,Perfect Guide,"For someone like me who can't tell business casual from business appropriate from business formal? This book is indispensable. The book's best features are its pictures and detailed lists of what's kosher and what's not, and of course, what people think of X, Y, and Z clothing. Granted, I will be making my own changes and tweaks to the suggestions, but I think this is the best set of guidelines I have ever seen for navigating the strange world of corporate attire, and as someone who has always had problems discerning when to wear what, this book is a godsend. I will be keeping this to refer to for the next 30 years (the rest of my career; I'm in the corporate audit/accounting field)."
1,Waste of time and money,"For first-time job seekers, or those with tatoos and body piercings, this book may be crucial for their success. But for an experienced corporate citizen, this book is a yawner. It does not contain any new or fresh perspective. I got a good laugh reading about how the mainland Chinese perceive women in good business attire as ""extravagant"" and how most women in China wear pants. When were the authors there?"
5,"A GREAT DICTIONARY- Durable, Words big enough to Read!","This pocket sized dictionary has a protective cover, making it perfect for carrying on trips out of the country. The print is clear and is large enough to be easily read. This durable book is a must for anyone needing a handy book for translating English to Spanish or Spanish to English."
5,A fantastic compilation of the best golf courses in America.,"This book is filled with wonderful photography and interesting information on most of the great golf courses that the United States has to offer. If you are looking to find some information or take a look at a fabulous public or private golf course that you are not too familiar with, this is the book for you."
4,Good Pens,"I like these pens. They write pretty smoothly for such a fine point. Definitely different from a .7mm pem but very good it you are looking for a fine point. You have to know how to write with them to not be disappointed. I have no problem, but friends who are a bit heavy handed think they do not work. It's their pressure. I like them very much, though."
3,ok,"This was recommended to me by a psychologist. It is an ok video, but not really amazing or anything. Great alternative to physical punishment, though."
4,Prepare for the return..,"The only other review about this album is a negative one, so I am obliged to write another. Since this is not an a bad album at all! Sure, if you think DD's debut album was their best one, you like you're rock albums sugar-froasted sweet and you're bound to hate this one. On the other hand if you like to rock n'roll with attitude: look no further. Four the hard way is a full-grown rock album, melodic with some rougher edges. Compare it to Winger's Pull, Poison's Native Tongue or Mötley Crüe's self titled album (The one without Vince Neil). All of these album's got bad reviews, though they are all high quality rock albums. Four the Hard Way prepares you for the Return of the Great Guildersleeves."
5,This album is great. It rocks all the way through.,Danger still has it. New front man and all. Still feels like dangers old stuff with a 90's meets bon jovi feel. I loved it. Definitly worth picking this one up.
4,80's Metal Fanatics Will Love This CD!,Its got all the fat choruses you would expect from one of the 80's greatest bands..if not the horniest! This CD isn't gonna change the world or break sales records....but it does rock! If you were into all those Hair Bands (I Still AM!) then you should get this CD.
2,a total dissappointment,"i bought this cd with a great expectation from a band that recorded great albums during 1988-1992 era.but in this album ,except the first two songs, they just sound like a band of 15 years old boys picked up their guitars and play school-like pop-rock songs.I wish Andy Timmons, who is just a guest in this album, didn't left the band.It can easily be seen how good he is at playing guitar and making great music with the first 2 songs.With the remaining songs the band sounds like playing between Bon Jovi and Dokken(1995 era)Which brings no orginality to the music.I wouldn't recommend this album to anybody who is in love with rock'n roll and serious about it."
3,Okay battery,This is my second of these batteries. Not many available. The one before lasted 6 months before it went dead. Beggars can't be choosers.
5,Excellent Customer Service,"The first battery they shiped to me arrived promptly but proved to be defective. I contacted by phone Brilliant Store's Customer Care and spoke with a very pleasant, helpful representative. She arranged to have a new replacement battery sent to me the same day and included a postage paid return envelope for me to return the original defective battery. The new replacement battery fits and works perfectly. Despite the inconvenience of having first received a defective item, the excellent manner in which they handeled getting the replacement to me ASAP and at no additional expense to me would lead me to definitely buy products from them again. Highly recommended!"
4,Breathtaking,"The quality of this publication is very impressive indeed and the fashion photography is excellent.However, as one reviewer said, some images are cut instead of being represented on a full page. At the same time, despite this flaw, this is a collection worth having in your library.Also, if this pleases you, I would take a look at Steve McCurry's ""Portraits."" You know an image is powerful when you start pouring tears because it represents humanaity in the most profound way. I have provided the link below.Steve McCurry: Looking East: Portraits by Steve McCurry"
1,"AWFUL, totally wrong version, terrible quality","Ugh, $20 down the drain. I thought I was buying the original cast, but apparently that one is ""Original Cast of Cats"" as opposed to ""Original Cast"" like this one. The quality of this one is terrible, TERRIBLE. I have to turn my volume up as high as it goes to hear it."
2,"Great ingredients,overcooked food...","Having some of the best guitar players in biz to back you up does not make for exceptional results as far as this album is concerned.Blues is about minimalism,simplicity and depth and authenticity of feeling-Rodgers is a great singer but but he adds a touch of banality to these songs;even the worst John Lee Hooker album would put these renditions to shame."
5,The best blues to be had!,"First of all , Paul Rodgers is the best male vocalist period. On top of that you add Jeff Beck, David Gilmore, Slash, Gary Moore, Brian Setzer, Steve Miller and a few other unbelieveable guitar wizzards, you can't possibly get a better blues alblum. And lest we forget they're playing the songs of Muddy Waters! Don't waste any more time thinking, this is a ""10"".Paul Shaffer is also there on the B-3."
5,As Good as it Gets!,"Could well be one of the best albums,(sorry, showing my age!),that I have ever heard. Every musician in the right place at the right time."
5,Best GasX,"My Westie LOVES to drink ANY KIND of standing water that in turn would make him my ""sewer"" puppy. Probiocin makes him a ""flower""!"
5,"Beautiful pix, helpful text","I love these Falcon guides mainly because of the lavish color illustrations. Every flower in the book has its own color picture, along with helpful descriptions. The front matter in this book includes all sorts of background material about the Mojave, along with the usual educational stuff about plant types, leaf distribution, etc. And the book is made to last -- if you take any care of it at all, it will last you forever."
4,Great CD,I really enjoy watching the reruns of traditional westerns of the 50's and 60's and these songs are right out of that era! I love 'em!
2,Mediocre,"This work performs the useful function of paying some attention to Mrs. Yeats and Yeats' domestic life, but is essentially a mediocre and sloppy piece of work, full of hasty, half-baked judgment, and occassional smarmy irreverence. Roy Foster's biography, though long, is infinitely to be preferred."
4,"Does your school teach ""fish grabbing with the bare hands""?","If you are in education--on either side of the desk, you will enjoy this old charmer. You will laugh at the longest bar in the world, Tequila Daisies, and all the notions they inspire about how education worked in the VERY old caveman days."
5,Saber-tooth curriculum,"needed for a class I teach, arrived in a timely manner and was in great shape as represented in ad"
2,1500 Copies?,"Put this cartridge in in December, it ran out today (5/3) after about 600 copies.Not very good performance, would you say?"
4,EXCELLENT,"What is the oldest cliche in the world? If it ain't broke, don't fix it. It applies you dad wants to tinker with your $20,000 McIntosh Monoblock, when your girlfriend asks you to go into couples therapy for no apparent reason, or when you are one of the worlds most inventive progressive rock bands; the only one to have written their own language.Magma put out some of the 1970s most enduring prog: if Miles' 1Bitches Brewmet Carl Orff's [[ASIN:B00005QHTA: Carmina Burana]], it would sound like Magma. This music was huge in structure but quite listenable--full of substance and void of flash, and holds up incredibly.This album could be from 1973. Magma has made the smart move of even sticking to warm electric piano straight out of your bell bottom as opposed to going with modern digital gloss. A style choice, but with Magma, it is always the writing that makes it work, and here, this is as top notch and fresh as ever."
4,Lavender Blue,Excellent CD. Bought this for a friend who likes lavender things and this CD worked just perfect.
3,ok. not great,I bought this for my kids to practice some songs. seemed ok not great. would have liked more interesting video along with the audio. kind of boring but good to practice
3,If your child likes to sing..........,"We bought this for my daughter at Xmas, and she loves it. She has always been into singing, and she has spent many hours with this game. The only beef I have with it is the grading system seems a bit easy. Although my daughter loves getting A+'s, she got kinda bored with getting them every time. But there were some cool features such as song and dress unlocks and what not. She still has her friends come over and play this game with her. If you are like me and judge your Xmas gifts on how long your kids actually play with them, then this game is well worth it."
2,"Qwirky, not that much fun","My niece got this game for Christmas. Thankfully we also got the Hannah Montana Wii game, we just weren't planning on giving it to her until her birthday. We had to give it to her early because of this lackluster game. If you are not musically talented and love karoke, this is not a game for you. She's a smart 8 and can sing a bit. Her friend is a talented singer too. Neither of them liked the game. Said it was too hard, couldn't figure out how to change to other characters and was more of a joke than anything. There is no warm up, introduction or anything. Hannah Montana came out and they loved it. They did the warm up and felt comfortable with the game right away.I wish before I had purchased the game I had seen a video clip of how the game was played. The warm up is a desperate need for this game."
3,It had the potential to be great....,"So here's the deal with this one... I'm a huge HSM fan and I was super excited to get this game and to sing along like the rockstar that I am. However, when you start to choose who you want to be and you start singing.. it automatically gives you the lower octives and harmonies for the male instead of the female.I know others have said you can kind of tweak it to make you sing either both parts but this should not have to be difficult to sing the part that you want. After my disappointment the first time I played the game, I stopped using it. I dont want to have to trick the game into letting me sing the parts that I should be singing already since I did choose the female characters!I dont know if I'm just doing it wrong or is this a mistake the gaming software came with that really needs to be fixed?"
3,"My seven year old says that it's, ""OK""","If I were reviewing this software, I would give it one star as it appears that they put this together overnight. However, this is a game for my seven year old daughter, who is a huge HSM fan, so I'm writing the review from her perspective. She thinks that it's just ""OK."" She has asked me numerous times why the boys in the video game are singing like girls. I had not noticed...but she's right...numerous times the boys' mouths are moving, but a girls voice is coming out (and vice versa). She enjoys the grading system and getting new characters, songs, singing locations, etc. However, she grows rather bored of it after two or three songs and goes back to playing Wii Sports. Since she said it was just, ""OK,"" I'm giving it three stars.I'm wondering if Santa should have bought her the Hannah Montana game instead."
3,Very Karaoke-like,"We've only tried it out a few times so far but my 8 year old HSM fan loves it. It's basically karaoke for the HSM 1 & 2 songs. So if you or someone you know is a big fan of HSM and like the music and like to sing, it would probably be fun, since it comes with a microphone and all you do is sing the words as they come up on the tv. I'd probably give it a 3.5 star."
2,Just so-so,I bought this for my granddaughter and she loves all things High School Musical. She was only mediocre thrilled with this.
2,"bad graphics, but fun for a while","QUite nice but..... IT IS VERY BORING. You cant even choose their outfits!!A limited number of songs, and fun but..... not that fun"
4,high school musical sing it bundle with microphone,The girls love to sing along to this game. Anyone who likes high school musical will love this game. It doesn't matter if you sing well or not the game calculates the pitch so once they learn how to do that they will score an A all the time. It is fun to watch the girls sing.
1,No Microphone,No microphone. It was supposed to come with a microphone. It even said on the label “with Microphone”. This is Christmas Eve and we are getting all the presents ready and no Microphone. My two girls are going to be very disappointed.
3,This is not the same as the original,"Although this book sounded like a great reference for home pest control I was mislead. According to the author, this is a companion to the original detailed manual - Common Sense Pest Control. To be able to control specific pests like termites, carpenter ants or pests in the attic, the first book is the one to purchase. I sent my Gardener's Guide back."
2,Ticks Omitted - Where did they go?,The Hardback Edition that I wanted had excellent information on ticks and their control. This updated paperback has omitted ticks from these pages...I wish I could omit ticks from my garden as easily.
5,God be praised!,"Last summer my garden was invaded by the most foul, cruel and bad-tempered rodent you ever set eyes on. In fact, that rabbit had a vicious streak a mile wide. The way he ate through my cabbage, I'd swear that rabbit's dynamite! I tried taunting and other general methods of dissuasion, but to no avail. In Olkowski's text, chapter five -- no three -- is particularly useful in its detailed and comprehensive, yet brief, synopsis of the ground-breaking methods of garden pest control of both Tim the Enchanter and Martha Stewart. Overall, very effective!"
2,A silly Regency,"I found this book to stretch credulity to new limits. I think the other reviewers have been way too nice in their commendations. The two stars I have awarded this book are solely for the style of writing and language usage which is very good.The story, the characters, especially Hannah, are just not realistic. The fact that we are supposed to believe as readers that Hannah could possibly be so arrogant and obnoxious when the answer to anyone's prayers walks through her door is just crazy.The idea behind this story, Pygmalion, can be quite well done, I believe. Just not in this case."
3,"Kinda dated, and that's good news for us!","When I first read Rule's ""Desert of The Heart"" in the late 70's, there wasn't much else to read on the subject. Today, the book seems dated... much focus on shame and guilt, the characters ruminating frequently on society's insistence that women be married ladies, and such-like.Thanks to the gay and lesbian civil rights movement, this book doesn't apply to a lot of us anymore. But, thank you, Jane Rule, for putting out a book that many people held dear at the time.... it was a little opening up of the questions that people needed to hear discussed back then."
1,No one was a happy camper!,"Like many of the other smaller framed moms, I did not find the babysling to be comfortable for either me or my baby. It was much to bulky and in order to adjust it anywhere near my size I had a huge strap hanging behind my shoulder and there was no comfortable way for my baby to rest in it. I would take it out of the box and try it on first before purchasing. If your small framed, don't bother!"
5,Very comfortable for baby and dad..,"My wife and I called this the ""magic sling."" It succeeded when nothing else could in calming our little guy. When you wear it properly with the sling spread out across your back, it's VERY comfortable for either myself (6'4) or my wife (5'6""). Our son LOVES it even now at 7 months, because he can sit and watch the world go by. Sure, when he was an infant, he looked all contorted in the sling, but loved it...after all, he was much more contorted before he entered the world."
4,It worked for my son,"It seems obvious from reading through several of the other reviews that you will either love it or hate it. After some getting used to it worked great for my son. I was able to carry him everywhere, even hiking. He really liked being close. But as soon as he was moving around better and sitting up on his own, he wasn't interested in being in it anymore.If we'd had time, though, I would rather have had a Maya Wrap. Check into all baby slings before making a final purchase to see what will work best for you."
4,"Sling is favorite carrier, though not this brand","Dr. Sears books have proven to be the perfect compassionate parenting text. And his reccomendation for the sling carrier has made my baby a very happy one. It took me awhile to get the hang of it (2 weeks), but it's been worth it. My baby loves it, everyone comments on how happy and good she is, I take her everywhere, even to my medical school classes. This brand has the strap in an awkward spot, and does not come in varying sizes. So if you're not of average weight and height (5'5""-5'9""), I would not get this. Motherwear and One Hot Mama (both have websites) both sell versions that come in different sizes. Petite, Regular, Tall, and Large."
1,not made for everyone...,"I bought this babysling after reading about it in Dr. Sears' book. My daughter was 2 months old and fussy! Nothing seemed to work. I was desperate! Since the babysling was adjustable I thought it would fit all body types...not! I am of average height but on the slimmer side. It gave me alot of shoulder and back pain. I rate this a one star because I found one use for it...I use it tied around my torso to carry my daughter on my back with the slight support of my hands. Back carrying is a bit tricky so don't try it alone! I think baby slings are great but not this one is not for me. If you are slimmer than average, try the New Native baby carrier. It's portable and comes in different sizes."
4,"Angel Labrador of Davao City, Philippines","My 3 month old baby girl loves this product, she easily sleeps without geting to cry so loud beforehand and the nicest thing about this is I get to work while shes sleeping near me. It looks uncomfortable indeed but its so amazing how she sleeps so tight in it. The only negative i could think of at this time is it quite hard to put the baby on but still.. i still think its worth the $. Every working mother should try it!"
3,"Slings are an essential, but this isn't the best","I think slings are some of the most useful items for babies. They make nursing so easy, even while walking around on the street or in a busy store. I love the Sears Library, so I thought the Sears NoJo sling would be great. While I did use it for a long time, and would still recommend it over a front or back carrier (at least for the first few months), I found that this sling was difficult to adjust and my baby seemed to disappear in the first month or so. For small babies I prefer a sling with no railings, and more adjustable. The New Native sling and many others offer this. I would shop around online, there are many better slings than this."
4,Could not live without it!,"I absolutely could not live without a sling. I actually have 2 - the NoJo one is my ""backup"", as I like the ""Over the Shoulder Baby Holder"" better (more adjustable, more roomy for baby - available online at many different ""attachment parenting"" sites). But if you can't find them, or find the price difference alarming, this is a good choice. I have a very fussy 4 month old who literally lives in a sling. It is the best way to get her to sleep. Now that she is getting older she loves to ride sitting up and looking around. It is very comfortable, easy to use, and makes her SO happy. I never use a stroller, or her ""baby bucket"" carseat carrier. I now give slings to everyone I know who is having a baby!"
2,Think before you buy/register,"I'm sure this is a product many enjoy, however, I would borrow someone's after the baby is born to see if your baby will enjoy it. Mine did not. It was hard to maneuver, I felt like the baby was too constricted, and worst of all he screamed when placed in it."
1,Waste of money!,"There are so many other sling out there. Don't waste your timeor money on this. I hated the padding as it was bulky constricting and hot. It was also impossible to adjust. I got a couple of slings from www.equanimitybaby.com and one from www.peppermint.com and love these. Bottom line, check out the other options, this one is a waste of $$$."
5,This sling is supreme!,"Bottom line - this is probably the most useful & important piece of baby gear we've gotten. While it was a bit awkward for the first couple of months, I soon discovered that our infant loved to snuggle up against my chest in the sling (couldn't with Mama...). Then as she grew, both my wife & I used the sling to travel with & soothe our daughter. She's now a year & half and we still use it as a hip-carrier - and she often asks to ride in the sling for some parental comfort.Most baby gear is totally excessive, but this is simply essential for the whole family!"
2,Start early,"My newborn wanted to be held all the time. My arms would get so sore after hours of holding him. Based on a suggestion from the pediatrician, I bought this sling for my 4 week old baby. When I put him in it, he peered up at me for a few seconds, arched his back, then started screaming. After a week of trying I gave up and returned the sling. I think if I had put him in it after coming home from the hospital, it wouldn't have been such a problem. I don't think he liked not being able to see out of the thing or having his long legs dangling."
2,Get the Over the Shoulder Baby Holder instead,"Neither my husband nor I could live without a sling for our newborn! We got this one as a gift but quickly concluded that it just has too much fabric, which makes it difficult to position the baby properly and securely without ""drowning"" her in it. And the shoulder pad is huge -- can't get it to sit right on my shoulder (and I'm not petite).We then got a Maya Wrap, but either we're not ""advanced"" enough sling-users or it's better for bigger babies. Too little padding. (This is beginning to sound like the three little bears...)So now I have an Over the Shoulder Baby Holder, which is just right! Baby fits in it perfectly, the fabric is much lighter, and the shoulder pad gives me support in the right place."
2,Too bulky for me,"The carrier is a great idea, however, it is too bulky for me. It is not that easy to figure out all the different ways to use it and felt uncomfortable around my shoulder and neck.My baby was premeture and at the time I bought this was about 7 lbs. He was not comfortable in it and his head never seemed to be in the right position. It covered his head and left his body all twisted.I was very disappointed."
1,too hot for summer,"I had heard such great things about this sling, but when I got it I was highly disappointed. It was very warm to wear (which I guess would be okay if I lived in Alaska) and difficult to maneuver baby in and out of carrier."
1,Just because it's recommended by Dr. Sears...,"Doesn't mean it's the only way to ""wear"" your baby. The padding in the railing was a double-edged sword. On one hand, it's comfy; on the other, you can't get the darn thing tight enough. I like my baby to be snug against me and I can't get this one tight enough. I love the padding on the shoulders though. My husband uses this one since he's bigger and doens't need it to be as taunt. I use a Kissasling, and the three of us are all happy."
2,Not Worth the Money,I recived this sling as a gift for my now 2 year old son. It was really difficult to use. I could not tighten the shoulder strap enough to feel my baby was secure. Im a Attachment parent so I despratly wanted to use a sling after 2 weeks of frustation i gave up I Bought a Taylormade baby sling instead it is wonderful and I still carry my 2 year old in the sling to this day so save your time and money and do not buy this sling!!!
5,Nice cozy ride...,"When I would take my newborn for walks in this sling, people would look at me a little strange, since he would pretty much disappear inside. He seemed to love the sling until he was more alert & staying awake more, then we needed to go to a backpack carrier. The video shows ways to carry your baby until they're 30 lbs, but that was pretty unrealistic since the sling tends to really squish the baby, the bigger they get. I was also never able to carry him without supporting him with at least one hand. I loved this for the first couple of months, and would use it again for another baby, but you don't get long-term use out of it. The best thing about it was that it would calm my son & put him right to sleep. And the bonding was wonderful."
2,One Size Does NOT Fit All,"I love Dr. Sear's books, but this baby sling is much too large! I am a slightly small framed 5'5"" woman. My 6'5"" husband wears this sling just fine. But, for a sling to work for YOU, it MUST FIT properly! I finally bought a sling that fit me when my son was over 1 year old. I couldn't believe what a difference it made and felt so sad that I hadn't tried a different sling sooner. My son loves sitting in it on my hip and brings it to me whenever I am working in the kitchen. Try the Rosado sling or any other brand that comes in sizes and buy the size that fits your body! You will really be able to enjoy the baby wearing experience that Dr. Sears recommends so highly!"
5,Thrilled with this product,"My son was premature and is too small to fit the Baby Bjorn that we bought, so I got this sling to use until he can fit the Baby Bjorn. After trying the sling, I don't think I'll be using the other carrier much at all. He loved the sling from day one. It was not at all hard to learn to use. I just read the instructions and played around to see which position my son likes and once I found it, he went right to sleep. He loves it and I have my hands free to do things while still being close to my baby.I was worried that slings may not be secure or that a baby could fall out, but this sling is very secure. I am not at all worried that he'll fall out after using it."
1,Not a comfortable sling! There are better ones out there!,"This sling was extremely uncomfortable for me...even when my baby was a newborn and only 7 pounds. I am 5'5"" and slender so that may be part of the problem. (As I see that other petite/slender people found this sling problematic.) I had a lot of back and neck pain with this sling. I currently use a Maya Wrap (which is unpadded) which is extremely comfortable even though my daughter is now 22 pounds. The Maya is also less bulky, since there is no padding. I also have no problem nursing in the Maya."
3,Good but there are better ones out there.,"I had several friends that had a variety of slings (NOJO, OTSBH, Maya Wrap,... I talked to all of them before having my baby and they all agreed that while slings in general are terrific, the NOJO is not the best. I'm not sure what it is about it, but it doesn't seem to be quite as snug as some of the others (other padded slings come in a variety of sizes). I ended up getting an over the shoulder baby holder and I couldn't manage without it. I had a colicky baby who practically lived in the sling. Slings are a little hard to get used to at first, but they are definitely worth the effort. I have a friend that has a hooded blanket that is waterproof to go with her sling - she never even uses a stroller. All in all, slings are definitely worth it, but there are better ones out there."
1,Not what I was expecting!!!!,"I bought this for my 8 week old daughter, we are planning a trip to Texas and did not want to take the heavy stroller...I tried her in the sling,she got very hot and because of that she got heat rash all over her face and neck (she was only in the sling for about 10 minutes)!!!! I did not like all the padding, it makes it to bulky! On top of all that it gave me a back ache!!If you are serious about a sling I would choose the Maya, it is a thinner material, and is not bulky at all. That is what I ended up buying, and my daughter loves it and so do I."
2,One Size DOES Not Fit All,"I love Dr. Sear's books, but this baby sling is much too large! I am a slightly small framed 5'5"" woman. My 6'5"" husband wears this sling just fine. But, for a sling to work for YOU, it MUST FIT properly! I finally bought a sling that fit me when my son was over 1 year old. I couldn't believe what a difference it made and felt so sad that I hadn't tried a different sling sooner. My son loves sitting in it on my hip and brings it to me whenever I am working in the kitchen. Try the Rosado sling or any other brand that comes in sizes and buy the size that fits your body! You will really be able to enjoy the baby wearing experience that Dr. Sears recommends so highly!"
4,Great infant carrier!,"I began using my Babysling when my son was only a few days old. I especially like it for long events where you'll need to nurse... weddings, church services, etc. Once I had some practice I could nurse completely discretely while wearing the sling.Some of the reviews have complained that baby is bent sideways, but it seems to me they must be using it wrong. The baby should either face you (curled foward around your body) or away (curled frontwise). Unless they were trying to lay the baby flat, facing upwards? Anyhow, our newborn found it extremely comfortable.I went with only 4 stars because now that my son is a bit older (3 months) he seems to prefer the Baby Bjorn to be out and about... but couldn't use the Bjorn as a newborn. For us, it was worth it to buy both!"
1,So UNCOMFORTABLE for the baby. BULKY and HARD to use.,"My daughter is 40 days old. As soon as I laid her in the sling and had the sling in carrying position I could see that she was very uncomfortable.Contour of your stomach is not FLAT but CURVED. It tilts my daughter's spine SIDEWAYS when she is lying flat in the sling. It's just not a comfortable position for the baby.The video teaches you how to carry the baby in different ways. However, they are useless if the baby is an infant and can't support her neck on her own.Besided, it is BULKY and HARD to use. I am returning it."
1,"My baby said ""no""","I tried this sling upon recommedation and hated it. My son screamed and fussed. He was uncomfortable and so was I and he wasn't about to take time to find the ""right position"". It just was an awkward contraption."
2,Very complicated and uncomfortable for Mommy and Baby,"I bought this thinking that it was the best sling in the market. From the moment I tried to use it, I could not get it right. I tried the different ways that it suggested but it was alwas very uncomfortable. I tried putting the baby inside of it and he always looked to be in a very awkward position. One half of his body was twisted one way and the other half was twisted the opposite way. I just feel bad that I was unable to return it. It was a complete waste of time and money."
2,Not for us........,"After reading all the great reviews on the sling I decided to try one. We both hated it. Maybe because I'm 5'1 and my son was eleven pounds when he was born made it more difficult. I kept trying to make it work for us but after 6 months I gave it up. I ended up giving it away. It's not one size fits all. If you're short, think twice on this."
1,"Uggh, Nojo is a no go!","This is by far the worst sling I have ever tried! The padding is bulky and hot. It is impossible to adjust. Total waste of money. I bought a pouch from www.equanimitybaby.com and it was perfect! easy to use and very comfy. The bottom line is there are many other options out here besides this peice of junk. If you can't use this sling, its not you, its the sling!"
3,Slings in general beat front carriers.,"I'm more a fan of an unpadded sling, but ANY sling is better than a front pack (Snugli, Baby Bjorn, etc). I have a taylormadetreasures.com sling, and I love it. The Maya Wrap is fun too. Some moms SWEAR by the Dr. Sears sling though. They say especially with a smaller baby, they liked the padded. You just have to find the one that you like best. SLINGS ROCK."
1,imposible mezcolanza,"Si eres aficionado a la música de King Crimson, pasa de este disco Si, por el contrario, eres aficionado al Heavy, no sé, seguramente te agradará. El problema del denominado metal-progresivo es que, en su propia definición está formado por dos conceptos que son incompatibles. El Heavy es una serie de clichés, estereotipos y fórmulas ajenos a cualquier desarrollo o evolución. El rock progresivo es, o debería ser, todo lo contrario. En este disco se dan ambos elementos, es cierto, pero de forma sucesiva, nunca al mismo tiempo. Tras un tema o parte de un tema tipicamente heavy se sucede un desarrollo progresivo que podría ubicarse en cualquier disco de King Crimson o de Yes, pero acto seguido esto desaparece para estar, de nuevo, alte el típico riff guitarrero de cientos de miles de discos metaleros.En definitiva, no pierdas el tiempo con este disco."
2,"Bland, dreary and utterly shameless","Remember the old agage ""too many cooks spoil the broth""? Well, apparently it works in music as well. There's no doubt Portnoy, Petrucci, Rudess, and Levin are masters at their respective instruments, but throw their egos together in an instrumental jam session and their relentless persuit of speedy riffs and long solos sounds so manufactured that it undermines any emotional response from the listener apart from the occasional foot-tap. Take Rachmaninov, strip away the beautiful interplay of piano and symphony and you're left with most of what LTE represents: fast, well-ordered noise which most computers could be programmed to generate. This album does little more than prove that technical perfection alone doth not good music make."
1,"Instrumentalists, not musicians","I tried, I REALLY tried to like this album. I've been looking for good jazz rock, prog rock or whatever you want to call it. So after having read the RAVE reviews on this web site I bought the album. It is true that these guys can play; the mastery over their instruments is truly virtuosic. But for my taste they lacked musical ideas. Regular I, IV, V progressions played with astonishing virtuosity. But just no real SOUL to the music. No themes, no well-crafted melodic shape, just a flurry of notes for the sake of it. If you are looking for something with strong melodies, interesting modulations that are integral to the structure of the music rather than tacked on, something that bears repeated listening, this ain't it. We have a word for this sort of music in England; Fretwanking. Empty virtuosity. I'll give my copy away."
2,Technical arrogance,"Not all super-bands can do it. Like this one. Once Toxik (an old progressive thrash band) had a song called ""technical arrogance"" which consisted of full of mind-breaking riffs, kind-of-unison attacks and similar things. Well, at least they knew what the song sounded like. LTE does not. I was expecting more keyboards and bass sections, and I found out cutting-thru' drums and unfitting guitar riffs, like the new DT used to have (btw, DT is dead after Kevin Moore is gone). Why Richie Kotzen or Jan Cyrka can't ever be great like Steve Vai? It's the same reason as Portnoy can't ever be great like Dave Weckl. Being a good musician does not always mean, being a good songwriter. However, this CD deserves to get 2 stars, instead of 1, just because of it's another experimental album in this virtuoso industry."
1,Pretentious rock.,"In my opinion, this is a nothing more than a technical statement. Go listen to Death's ""Symbolic"" or Celtic frost's ""Into the pandemonium"" if you want real progression. They run circles around these fools."
1,More listens - more ...,"I have to say, I've listened to this more than once and more than a few weeks apart. In many ways it is like elevator music. The keyboards are reminiscent of Utopia from ""Ra"". Unique then, derivative now. The guitar playing has no edge. The bass, of course, is great - but even Tony Levin is muted by this rag-tag team. If you like easy-listening, this is the music for you. If you want something challenging, try the Projeckts by the fractalized King Crimson or Polytown by Torn, Bozzio and Karn. That music will challenge your senses. This is rock for the ""in"" crowd."
5,amazing,"If you have any interest at all in prog rock, you need to pick up this album. This thing cooks like a Texas barbeque, and there is more solid axework here than in a truckful of steroid-pumped lumberjacks. Perhaps the only complaint I have is that it occasionally wanders off into brief forays of cocktail lounge music, but at 74 minutes, you're still getting your money's worth.P.S.: This review also applies to their second album."
3,Intense,"Talented, talented musicians but... Its not something I can just sit down and listen to. Notes blend together at points, it seems to be a contest of who can play the fastest. Its an aquired taste I suppose, too intense for me, but I can appreciate their level of skill with their respective instruments."
3,Convincing hypothesis,"3 1/2Prog rock technical-ites should love what some of these DT guys cook up in their off hours- potent, if slightly overbearing and compressed sounding ultra-jams which do not relent until the final curtain call."
5,Four virtuosos turn in a top performance.,"Mike Portnoy (Dream Theater) was asked to put together a ""super group"" and record a CD in record time. He enlisted King Crimson's bassist deluxe Tony Levin and keyboard wiz Jordan Rudess. Rudess was actually asked to join Dream Theater (after playing one gig with them) but declined! He wound up with the Dixie Dregs. All Portnoy needed was a guitarist, so he turned to his partner in Dream Theater for many years, John Petrucci. What you get does sound very much like Dream Theater...only more insane!!! Levin adds his distinctive touch and Rudess shows us what Dream Theater might have sounded like, had he joined."
5,Best Instrumental Rock Album I've Ever Heard,"Simply put, this is the best instrumental rock album I've ever heard. There is a strong influence of many of the bands these men have played with or been fans of: King Crimson, the Dregs, Dream Theatre and others. All of these influences are mixed together in an astonishlingly diversified manner with music ranging from metal anthem to experimental to ambient. These are musicians that simply decided to play whatever they wanted and are skilled enough to do just that. Despite their incredible level of individual talent, each lets the others shine, revealing a band with exceptional chemistry. This album is a must for fans of instrumental rock music."
4,Flying the flag for Progressive Rock,"What never ceases to amaze me in the field of popular music is, what is actually popular. LTE play great Progressive Rock and yet when I say their name to my friends, all I see is a glazing over of the eyes and complete incomprehension. I have just seen the band ""Transatlantic"" here in Munich and am now a huge fan of the drumming of Mr Portnoy from LTE.If you want an antidote to ""pap"" music, give this CD a spin and renew your faith in ""real"" music being played by flesh and blood people."
3,These guys are lucky,"Lucky because they have the talent to make a totally enjoyable cd in one week. That being said, I can't help feeling a little ripped-off. Just imagine what great material could have been written if they had taken more time to fully flesh-out their ideas. Petrucci and Portnoy finally did the right thing and convinced Mr. Rudess to join Dream Theater (who take more than a week to record an album)."
3,Me thinks this is a great effort for a week's work,"Great effort, but doesn't quite hold a candle to LTE2. Although in the defense of this record Paradigm Shift has the craziest intro to any song known to mankind. Musically speaking though a pure work of genius although at times a bit boring."
2,OVER-RATED,"I don't have a large budget to spend on progressive rock CDs, so when I plunk my money down, it had better be good from start to finish or else it gets dumped on Ebay. Sadly, this one is Ebay-bound.After the initial excitement of the hot playing wore off, I realized that for every killer riff, there is an equal amount of aimless noodling that goes absolutely nowhere. But such is the nature of ""improvised"" music, as this purports to be. If you were to get together with your band and jam for an hour, there would be some sparks of brilliance which you would extract and build a song around. There would also be a whole lot of mediocre junk which would remain on the shelf.In the interests of being extreme, Petrucci (guitar) and Levin (stick bass) also occasionally wring some horrifically ugly sounds out of their instruments.The second LTE album is more focused. Actually, if you combined the best tracks from both albums, you'd have one killer disc!!!"
3,It Bores Me,"It's okay. I'm 7 and just some levels I don't like. I always win, but sometimes I don't win. I like some of the levels. The levels are pretty cool, and I know that some levels, the characters live there. I don't play it that much because it bores me."
4,Even though I play PS2 games I still have time for this,"I love the Crash games I got this back in 200o But this is still a great game. The graphics aren't that bad, and it's a great game for kids, and not one of these violent games. This is something everyone can enjoy. You race main bosses from other crash bandicoot games and theres a new alien guy whos not hard after the 2nd time you play him. These is a great famliy game and your parents can enjoy it to."
5,classic!,"though this is not a real classic Crash game it still beats the rest! This was the first video game i ever got, it was 1999 and im still playing it. It is a real simple game to beat when u are going for trophys, but then it get challenging. I doesn't have good graphics, but im not to picky about graphics when it comes to this game. All in all CTR is so fun it will keep you playing for hours!"
5,Yahoo!,"This game kicks the butt of Diddy Kong Racing and Mario Kart! The BEST racing game ever!I recomend this to everywone. 8 characters to play,(example Tiny, Dingodile, Polar and Pura) and 6 chacters to find!(example N Tropy, Ripper Roo, Komodo Joe and Pinstripe)"
4,CTR is cool,"Great game. Most people say they can beat CTR in about 3 days, but you have to beat every aspect of it. It took me about a week to get to 100%, but I played it before. It is a great multiplayer game if you are looking for one.You can use so many weapons to ensure winning. You don't get frustrated if you lose a race. You get happy. It is fun to play races over again. There are also so many different modes to play.Oh and just if your wondering yes it is better than Speed Punks.I also wrote these reviewsFinal Fatansy TacticsDigimon world 3"
4,"Pretty good, but needs a little work","It is an excellent game but it needs work. I personally think it is way too easy, but it's still fun. I couldn't give it a 5 star rating because it wasn't exciting enough, and I love exciting games. But, it was an overall good game if you like racing games and action. Don't waste your time... buy it! ~ Snoweater11, Weymouth MA"
1,DID NOT WORK,I ordered this game along with many other Playstation one classics. All of them worked except this one. We tried using different systems but the game would not play at all.
5,COOL!,This game is asome because its a racing game and i LOVE racing games this game you can pick up to 5 places but thats not all because it just isn't.If you beat all 5 or 7 i'm not sear you can go on to MORE places.
5,Possibly the best kart racer ever.,"I just wanna make this short, so I just wanted to say to families, independent playas, and friends to buy it, and never trade it in to your local game store, since youll be having the most fun youve ever had!!! I recomend this game to the world, wheather they hate racing or hate Crash or not!! Im telling you, YOU WILL LOVE THIS TO DEATH!!! I dont play it anymore, but it still remains one of my favorite Crash games. BUY OR DIE, PEOPLE!!!"
5,This is game is so fun!!,"by my 7 y.o. and 4 y.o.This game is so fun. I feel like playing it every day! I like it because we can throw bombs at each other (!?) and we can do other activities. I recommend you buy it!!!h. age 7This game is awesome, dude! I can't believe they made it! Its the best in the whole wide world, I play it with my sister!l. age 4"
5,crash racing,"From the creators of the Crash Bandicoot series comes Mario Kart racing for the PSX! Built on a brand new game engine, Crash Team Racing is one of the best looking racing games on the PSX, with detailed environments and high framerates. Select one of eight different characters to race across more than 20 different track in Adventure, Time Trail, Versus, Gran Prix and Battle Modes. Take your favorite Crash Bandicoot character and race him against 3 of your friends for bragging rights!There's a new mad scientist in town and his name is Nitros Oxide and he's about to wreak his own havoc on this little island paradise. He's absolutely obsessed with speed and fast just isn't fast enough for him so he concocts a crazy idea to speed the whole world up forever!Tune your own ""wheels"", pick up goodies and watch out for those environment hazards. This game boils down to pure racing fun. ..."
5,great!!!!!!!!!!!!!,PeopleI have played this game many times in my life.It is great to play all the levels u get to play and once u reach the top the skys the limit in the game. Please buy it!
5,Great racing game,Excellent game!This takes me way back to the good old days of playstation one tournaments at home with my family.
4,Crash Team Racing---Putting TNT crates on Mario,"I would definitely recommend this game to people who have their friends come over alot. It is very fun to play with other people. The price is great. ... is so low for such a nice game it's unbelievable. The game's worth every penny.As for Mario Kart, I think CTR is just inches ahead Mario Kart. I like the tracks better (much better) in CTR, and the Drivers are good (both games need improvement, the driver's skills are very close and not unique, such as, one specializing in speed, or, one with really good handling) But one thing that they tie on is Weapons. I can't decide. I like some of the weapons on Mario Kart, and some on CTR. CTR is cheaper, so I think Crash Team Racing wins this race.I hope this review helped all of you!"
5,"The best racing game, and game of the series","Not only is this the best racing game ever (really it is) but its also the best in the series. With all it's different modes, weapons, secret characters, levels, it never wears out. I still love to play it after having it for almost 2 years now!"
5,My 5 year old loves it!,My daughter recieved it for Christmas and loves beating her mom and dad. The game is easy enough for a 5 year old to play against the whole family and be successful. Fun and interesting game to play. Well worth the money!
3,"JST Male Connector with Lead, 20 Gauge (2)","Understand... These are specialty Items, NOT really ""Toys"".A must have for many RC toy ""upgrades"", or mods! This item is perfect for some of the Li-Po battery upgrades for many of the RC units.Anyone should understand that they MUST have some technical skills, (and a soldering iron), in order to utilize these items! They are NOT really toys, and you need to understand that when placing your order.BUT I'll warn ONE-&-ALL, do NOT order these from ""Best Service"" BEFORE placing your order on Amazon, MAKE SURE that they are NOT provided by Best Service"" they will/do NOT ship on time, OR notify you that they are NOT even in stock!I re-ordered these from ""PTOMart"" on amazon, and they shipped SAME DAY (via usps), and I got them the VERY NEXT day! PTOMart is awsome!"
1,The real...,Shame is that all these morons weren't armed to the teeth and finished each other off.Hard to root for any of these idiots.
2,Buy the Movies,"I love Abbott and Costello. I always have. Well, sure they were retired, if not dead, when I started seeing their films as a kid, but I loved them nonetheless. I tell you this because if you are contemplating this DVD you must be a lover of Abbott & Costello. I caution you now, this is no documentary, and a very sad attempt at a highlights reel. It simply amounts to being trailors for several of their films. I enjoyed it because I saw many of them on Saturday morning television with my grandfather, and only a small fraction of them seem to be available on DVD. But, if you are not a big fan, this DVD may be a big disappointment."
2,Anomaly,"I have this title on VHS, so replacing it with a DVD had been on my TODO list along with quite a number of films. The reason I bought this budget title on VHS in the first place is the inclusion of all those trailers, but the tape was low-quality, and worst of all, the letters GT (for Good Times) was bugged in the bottom corner of the screen, which is a personal pet peeve. Lo and behold, that annoyance has been digitally remastered and is a constant on the DVD version. Major letdown, but typical. Additionally, new (sub) titles have been added on each trailer, listing the title and date of the film at hand. In other words, if you are a fan of the novelty value of trailers, like me, then don't waste your money on this, since they get demolished on this collection. Otherwise, it's just a promo reel for their back catalog."
3,"Fun for fans, but only fans","This chronologically arranged career study consisting of theatrical trailers (coming attractions), film clips, and outtakes plays like a Special Features disc for a special collection rather than a stand-alone offering. So if you don't own any of their films, none of this will make much sense to you. However, Abbott and Costello completists will have fun watching a lot of footage not currently available elsewhere (not even on Universal's Franchise Collections), especially the ""blooper"" reels. (If you've been dying to hear Lou Costello swear, here's your opportunity.)"
2,LOGO WARNING!!!!!,"A rather poor review of Abbott & Costello films. Some interesting bloopers, but mostly trailers that have been ruined with superimposed info. Would have been passable if not for that damn ""GT"" logo throughout."
2,Worked Well - Until Crashed System,"I tried this model after the lesser model (GBU221) crashed my system. Unfortunately, I got the same resuts - ""blue screen of death""...system crash. Until the crash of my Toshiba laptop with Vista Home, this model did have a slightly better range than the GBU221. At least Amazon has a decent return policy."
1,Doesn't work with Macs and headsets,"I hoped to use this on Skype with my older Macintosh and a bluetooth headset. Iogear's specifications indicate that you can use this product with Mac 10.3.9 and above and with headsets, **but** while you can use this product on a Mac and I suspect with headsets on a PC, you can't use this device to connect your headset to your Mac. After getting ""your bluetooth hardware does not support headsets"" in both OS 10.3.9 and 10.4.11, I searched the net and found out there's no fix for this situation. If you are running Tiger and have USB-2, your best bet, according to my net research, is a D-Link dongle which has a much more limited range and may have to have an Apple firmware updater applied."
1,"FLAKY, not dependable","I don't enjoy giving negative reviews. It is just not ""Fun"".But, I have benefitted greatly from others reviewsand I feel responsible to ""give back"" by sharing my experiences.I have purchased 4 different ""Bluetooth wireless USB adapters"".THIS was the most expensive of the four ... and the WORST!I have tried ALL of them on the four computers in my home ...!TWO worked great. ONE worked ""O.K."" ...THIS ONE ... is USELESS!{Did my review help you decide?}"
1,Weak Signal,"I linked my PS3 Bluetooth ear set to my PC, I bought this thinking i would have a range somewhere near 300 feet, Not even close once i leave the room (12x20) there is static in the ear piece. I would not recommend purchasing this item, look into other adapters, this one is garbage..."
1,did not work,"Product stated that it worked for a 64 bit windows vista computer, but it didn't. Technical support from IOGEAR couldn't help. The website shows that it works for both 32 bit and 64 bit systems , but it only works for 32 bit. Do not buy."
1,Iogear USB Adapter,This was not what I needed. I misunderstood the description. So it is on the shelf unless I find someone to give it to.
4,Walk through the house with this book and follow its advice!,"I found this book to be helpful with its simple straightforward ideas to organize things. Since I can never have every room in the house organized at the same time, I like the way this book tackles one area/topic at a time. Ideas are short and sometimes of the ""duh!"" variety, but overall I found great suggestions for getting things in order. The book isn't expensive and from the few ideas I got, my $$ was definitely well-spent."
1,This book stinks.,"It was published only last year, but feels like it was written ten years ago. There are no pictures and very little helpful knowledge. I'm glad it was only $5."
1,Any idiot could have written this book,"I bought this book looking for some timesaving and unique ideas to help organize my life at home and at work. What I got was a list of 500 obvious ideas that any idiot could have thought up, given the time. 'Put addresses in your address book in pencil so you can update easily.' Duh! These ideas are too basic and really didn't help me at all. And if I had time to implement the 500 ideas in this book, then I wouldn't need the book at all! A big disappointment."
2,Art of praising oneself,"Ah yes, the ART edition! Jolly good! The contents were promising. The editor's outline looked encouraging. And I delved into the first section: ""the history of project management"". It was just a shell. There was no history. There was only the author's experience at Microsoft. Yes, IE and MSN. Disappointed at that section, I flipped through to the next chapter. Same thing. A shell with no real substance. Zoomed ahead to the next chapter: again, a description of what he did at Microsoft. IE and MSN. I am glad that I just borrowed this from the library. Lots of great chapter headings but nothing substantial or useful for the practicing PM. By the way, I congratulate the author on being the PM of the MS Internet Explorer and MSN projects. One can only get better: lots of lessons to learn from those projects."
5,Good Book for Architects Too,Solid practical advice on how to manage and control the chaos that is inherent in software development. Get this book if you're an architect or developer and you have to deal with incompetent PMs. It'll help you manage the manager!
4,My Reference Book for PM,"This is excellent book and I found there a lot of points to use for improvement in my job. It can be easily used as a reference book because often you need stronger arguments than only you experience and I would recommend to skim the convenient chapter(s) during the project and do such simply process review.The drawback of this book can be its orientation on the project in large companies. If you work for fifty people big company which is oriented on body-shops, then you would prefer slightly different view.I consider also some parts verbose. But anyhow I can recommend and I am sure I will use this book in the future and it helps me."
5,"Finally, A Good Business Book on Project Management","I am, at this writing, within 100 pages of the end of this book. Until I read Scott's book, I thought that ""practical PM book"" was an oxymoron. No methodologies, no pet processes, no technical mumbo-jumbo...just very practical and applicable advice on the significant aspects of getting work done."
2,Much better books exist!,"While this book does provide good information, I think that you can do much, much better. Most of the book is written almost as an advertisement for the author's own PCOS clinic. She spends so much time touting how wonderful that she is that it is hard to read the book. It also made me wonder how accurate the information is, or if she just wanted to brag on herself and her clinic. If you get this book do not make the mistake I did and also order ""The Savvy Women's Guide to PCOS"" by the same author. They books are almost EXACTLY the same. I recommend ""The PCOS* Protection Plan: How to Cut Your Increased Risk of Diabetes, Heart Disease, Obesity, and High Blood Pressure"" by Colette Harris."
4,Hormone information supplement,Although the book is well written it has a definite pro-estridiol/estrogen slant. The author acknowledges this and states she wrote this book to fill in some of the information gaps out there. This book is a very helpful supplement to understanding the role of hormones in the body but this is not the end all in information.
5,A Gift to Womankind!,"Dr. Vliet has once again managed to provide women with a wealth of information in a straightforward, very readable way. Her messages to us are presented in such a personal manner, it's no wonder so many women feel they have finally found a book written especially for them. This book is a powerful tool in the quest for a healthier life."
5,My Mother Loved this book,"My mother just turned 50 and has been noticing some changes that she has atributed to hormones. My uncle, a doctor, recommended this book to help her understand what is going on.Overall my mom really seems to like this book and i would recommend it to other pre-menopausal women."
2,THIS DR. ROCKS,This book is written for a woman by a woman. You will benefit from Dr. Vliet's knowledge of the subject of PCOS. She sheds light on all areas of the subject. PLEASE get a copy of this book if you are suffering of PCOS. You will not regret it!
4,Passable comedy,"The Bottom Line:Clockwatchers is not a perfect film but it manages to do everything just a little bit better than you might expect (e.g. developing its characters, accurately depicting its middle class milieu, engaging the audience in its storyline, etc.) and I walked away reasonably pleased; it's not a classic by any means and it doesn't approach the subtle brilliance of Office Space but if you've ever worked as a temp or like the actresses involved, you shouldn't hesitate to give it a rent.3/4"
4,A great Human Resources Film,"I was very impressed with this little gem of a film. Toni Collette is brilliant with her role. She has come a long way from ""Muriels Wedding"" and has made quite a name for herself as a character actor. Lisa Kudrow plays a great cynic. Parker Posey holds her trademark dark spritely self and does a great scene where she gets fired. All in all this movie presents a excellent interpretation of todays American office politics and how people in todays workforce are underpaid, underappreciated and are continually thrown to the way side. This movie holds well and makes you feel right along with what is going on within the film. I saw this movie on Starz just recently and I recommend seeing it for free first before buying this on DVD since this movie isn't all that great on DVD with the exception of wide screen format. Cheers!"

1,False Advertising,I was expecting the nero 6 ultimate all in one instead I received nero OEM Suite. The MPEG 4 encoder they claim is not included instead there is a thirty day trial. Better business bureau should be notified.
4,Better than 7.0,"I read horror storied about 7.0 Nero so I upgraded to 6.6 from 5.5 by going to the Amazon new & used market. This is a good program that does all you need for DVD's and CD's. It gets good reviews. I can't imagine what happened to 7.0 but they may have gotten carried away with ""user friendly-ness"" - I see a little of that in 6.6 compared to 5.5."
5,I'm still learning,"I have a long way to go on conquering all this product has to offer, but within one day I was able to import sound effects from another program and edit some songs that I wanted to.I did have some techincal questions and the tech-team was helpful in responding.I only wish I had realized when I bought it that it was not the latest version, but the update to add more 'goodies' was free on their website to anyone that owned this version."
1,refused shipment after inspecting,"Package looked good. Upon opening in front of UPS driver, hose was kinked. First item ever returned to Amazon. Guess we see how there refund policy works. Hose can't make it through packaging wouldn't make it in my shop. I not a picky person... this hose is obviously very flimsy. Was worth a try... i guess!!!"
2,Really Stiff,"I have to say I didn't use this hose. It arrived with a good kink in it from packaging, so I sent it back. But for people who are interested: The hose translucent, not clear. It is also very stiff. It can bend, sure, but it is not like a wire spun hose or a shop vac hose. If you are doing a fixed setup where the hose will not move after installed it could work, but I would not use this is you have a small shop and move your dust collector from tool to tool."
5,"Wonderful, Original Science Fiction Book For Teenagers","I first read this book when I was 14 and absolutely loved it. The plot is one of the most original that I have ever read. Although the Forgotten Door by Key is a lot better known and I have also read that, I think that Golden Enemy is a lot better. Although it is targeted towards teenagers, I think that adult science fiction readers would also enjoy it."
3,Good Grief!,Oh my God. This is one of the most interesting and scary books Mccaffrey has ever written. She never even let the character get on with her life. Every time something interesting happenes to Lunzie McCaffrey puts her in Cryosleep. She never lets the heroin get anywhere.
2,Where's the conclusion???,"I was enjoying this book thoroughly until it came to its abrupt end. There was no sense of completion, no tying up of loose ends, nothing. The book simply ended in the middle of a new conflict. This ruined the entire experience... I would NOT recommend this book unless you enjoy being left hanging."
3,Where's the ending?,I found this book to be enoyable reading. Anne McCaffrey does her usual good job with the character development and relationships. The only problem was in that it ended before the story ended.
1,"""Death of Sleep""?! ""Sleep of Death"" is more like it!","The series starts out great with ""Sassinak"" but comes to a dead stop with ""The Death Of Sleep"". This is the most boring book I have ever read! It's one huge sidetrack. If you read the ""Planet Pirate"" series, *ignore* this book. You can read the first and last books and not miss a thing..."
1,Disappointed,"I am in agreement with previous readers who found the numbers disturbing. Whatever Glen's reasoning is for them, I think it's a ""humor"" too advanced for children to understand and disturbing for parents like me. This type of illustration should be saved for a more mature audience."
1,UpSet,"I recently read ""Cowboys"" with my child. I thought it was a pretty good book. My child really enjoyed the illistrations and the story. I was really disturbed though when I got to page 19 and right in the middle of the steer was the numbers 666. Well, we finished reading it and afterwards I went back through it and discovered that there weren't any numbers, symbols or anything on the other steers or anywhere for that matter. So, why such a negative number on that one steer? Well, I guess I will just have to pay closer attention to what my child reads. I didn't think this happened until they got a lot older. The biggest kicker of them all is the fact that it was brought home from the school library.Sincerely, K. Nichols"
4,Arrived Early,Book arrived earlier than expected and is as advertised. It has answers to the odd as well as the even numbered problems.
1,...,"This is the worst math book I have EVER used. Awful awful. When I needed help, did I turn to my outrageously priced trig book? Nope! Google was of more help than this book.So, what is wrong with it?No background. I hadn't been in school for 7 years. I was a bit rusty and this book was of no help. It has really bad examples (if you are lucky enough to get an example for the type of problem you are working) that skip steps and don't give any explanation of the concepts.The my mathlab that comes with this book is great. It really supplements where the book fails."
2,Needs improvement!,"The explanations in this book could be more concise for students who have other assignments to study and fulfill. Throughout all my years in reading mathematical textbooks, this one does not head straight-to-the-point. The author spends more time introducing the subject than explaining how one step is derived from another in the examples, which leaves the student to spend time figuring how one concept abruptly transitions into the next. Aside from that, the exercise questions sometimes do not relate to the examples given in the book."
2,Vague and Unclear,The textbook does not have central focus and all the formulas are not explained properly. The explanations are overbroad and vague and do not focus on the most important stuff. I would not recommend this textbook to any student. The two stars I give is for the nice paper it is printed on.
2,Very unclear,"This book is one of the most unclear concepts i have ever tried to learn. The examples are really tough and sadly have nothing to do with the exercises themselves which made my self learning very long, boring, and pretty much a waste of time. I understand the graphing, but i dont understand why they add calculus problems to it like the difference qutient. But on the plus side, the cover and the pages are really nice and good looking. But the examples themselves are long and a waste of paper, no offense. I wouldn't really recomend this book for self teaching, but u can use it maybe if u have a tutor which i dont have. Good luck shopping for a trig book! :P"
5,Best I've Ever Used,"This is the best devotional aid I've ever found. You can spend the suggested 20 minutes per day reading the passage and answering the questions, or you can use the questions as a starting point to probe deeper into the meaning and message of Scripture. This book ranks as one of the best kept secrets in Christian publishing."
3,Nice quality for the money,"Bought these as a gift for my sister-in-law. They look very nice on her, and she says that she loves them. She has had no problems with tarnishing or any issues with the jewels. The clasp seems strong and sturdy."
2,"Worked - then, NOTHING","Worked great at first, then, without warning wouldn't take a charge. Now need to replace ASAP. Really ANNOYING."
1,Terrible,"Purchased this battery and worked great at first, but after 2 months, the battery went bad. Must have a bad batch of batteries"
2,Good for 2 months,"At first this battery works GREAT! But when you least expect it, the battery is completely DEAD."
3,replacement battery IBM T41,"The battery arrived in a timely fashion but like the original, does not provide the near 5 hours of battery life. It has expanded somewhat, but I'm still only getting close to 3 hours."
2,very unreliable,"I got this battery because when I placed the order with Lenovo, their estimated shipping date was 2 months from the date of placing the order (???).The one here is not produced by Lenovo, it is actually shipped to you directly from China! It's also very unreliable. I've had it for almost a year, and it already happened three times that, for some strange reason, it cannot be recharged for some period of time. The first time I thought it died completely, wrote to the seller, and they responded they I should send it back to them in China (they would either reimburse me or send a replacement). While I was waiting for a convenient day to go to the post office, it somehow magically started to recharging again. So I kept it. The same situation happened twice more, and every time in a few days the battery magically came back to life.It lasts somewhere between 3 and 4 hours for me, as long as the original Lenovo battery I finally received."
2,Problems with dark colors/shadows,Quality for dark photos and shadows is poor. Dark areas come out with uneven/banded colors. It seems like the severity of the problem changes with where you place the photo on the scanner. The best area I've found is at the top of the bed near the lid hinges. I'm going to exchange mine to see if it is a problem with my specific unit.
2,Machine not bad but Service not good,"I had the 4900 for about 6 months and was happy with it. After that time I noticed 2 heat marks on the underside of the glass which showed up in the scanning. I had to make several phone calls at my expense (they don't have an 800 customer service no. and the wait time consistently exceeded 30 minutes), they told me I had to send them the scanner and they would repair it. While I shipped it priority, they sent it back to me via ground. It took 2 weeks. When I opened it up and tried it, the screen had a bluish tint and it made noise. After more calls, they agreed to replace it with a new machine. They arranged for ground transportation and sent a ""new"" one back priority. The new one also had a bluish tint and made a tinny noise when scanning. After more phone calls, they felt that the scanner was performing within proper ranges. So I'll wait until I can't use it and then replace it with a different make. I weight the customer service 1/2 star."
1,"No gain, All PAIN!",Wont waste too much time on this. It aint worth it !1. The scanner is darn slow.2. Go for scanning dark slides and you are in for a real shock. No amount of 'Gamma Correction' or 'Hue/Brightness/Contrast Setting' would set it right.3. WORST EVER Technical Support. The only free support is email based. Whats worse is that the site doesn't have this 4900 model mentioned in some of its driver updates section. Free Technical support is only for Installation - that too only for the first 90 days. All others s 15$ incidental !4. Talk about using the good scanning software like VueScan or SilverFast and u'r in for another surprise ! None support this scanner.I have been sitting before this piece non-stop for the past 3 days. Just cant figure out how can anything be sooo horrible. This piece goes back and I can finally have some peace of mind !
1,"All Pain, No GAIN !","One Word - WORST EVER SCANNER for Slides.Wasted a looooooong weekend over this scanner, trying to scan some contrast and some dark slides. No amount of 'Gamma correction' or 'Brightness and Hue/Saturation Correction' could even get it anywhere near right.Since the built-in software with the scanner was pretty limited, I thought I could try some 3rd party software . But the scanner does not support either of them.Realllyyyyyyy SLOWWWWWWBR>"
3,Good Overview of The King,"(3 1/2 *'s) 'Elvis: King of Entertainment' is more of a documentary than it is a compilation of performances. It is an overview of the highlights of his life, his career, his performances, and his movies. As a sampler it works well. Interspersed with television performances and interviews, it is a testament to the phenomena that Elvis is and was. The only drawback is that the brief touches of each highlight will only be teasing and never really satisfying. Seeing footage of his army induction, his wedding, and early as well as Las Vegas performances are an interesting draw.(Avoid by all means the companion video 'Elvis: Rare moments with the King,' which is published by the same company, is shorter, and repeats the highlights here. With almost no musical samples, the latter is almost more an archive of only sociological importance.)"
2,More doumentary and little substance,"Not bad for a 'history of elvis' type program. Not much at all in the way of any performing. It moves slow and tends to lose you in the first 15 minutes or so. If you want to learn about how elvis got to be ""Elvis"" then this would be a good disc. If you are looking for simply his shows & songs, this is the wrong DVD."
4,A very fun read,"Ben Morrison is a sweet guy who falls like a rock for Lauren Holt the first moment he sees her... but she's been scarred by life and won't even consider dating anyone. So, he settles in to be her friend, hoping she'll learn to trust him in time. Lots of fun banter between them and some very natural conflicts, between Lauren's hopes and fears, and especially between the newly-converted Ben and his very-non-Mormon family. The author does a great job of setting up a very convincing crisis of love and faith, and then resolving it in a satisfying way.I'm not a Mormon, so there were things that went over my head, but overall I still really enjoyed reading this."
2,Not the movie,"I originally bought this DVD thinking that this was the movie starting with Alec Ramsay being saved by the Black. As I watched it I realized that it was a TV show and a poorly done one as well. The script is poorly written at best and it's almost a shame that Mickey Rooney accepted a contract. There are a total of about 4 episodes plus a bonus that seemed to be a bonus only because I couldn't determine where it fell in the timeline. Having read all of Walter Farley's books, I couldn't even tell which books the show was based off of. The Black was played by a Friesan Stallion, not even an Arabian, and was referred to as a Thoroughbred. Having been involved with horses almost all of my life, this was probably the most disturbing. The cinemetography was poor and I probably will not ever watch it again."
5,Awesome,"I loved this show when it was on the Family Channel and definitely enjoy the DVD. Those who complain it is not the original ""Black Stallion"", all you have to do is look at the date of 1990 and KNOW it couldn't possibly be the original!!!! JEEZ, give me a break!!!"
2,Not what I expected!,I must've read it wrong or something but this is not the movie I was expecting. :(
1,Don't buy this DVD,Poor story line and just plain bad acting. The only one with any sense in the movie is the horse and he wasn't on camera most of the time.
4,Really like!,"Love the characters - grumbly horse trainer Mickey Rooney (who was also the trainer in National Velvet with young Elizabeth Taylor), jocky Alex and of course the beautiful Black stallion. Whiat's interesting besides the main story lines, is the fact that the story physically moves from one beautiful location to another, giving glimpses into places like rural France and New Zealand."
3,Nice series,"This was a nice series of shows, but when these came out I was hoping they would follow the books more. For instance, the series would start after the Black Stallion Returns. Mabe have shows about The Black's first son and go from there. Was disappointed they didn't do that, but it was still a decent."
1,:(,"I have yet to receive this item, but it may because the handler hasn't had a chance to ship it or, I simply missed the mail man/ UPS man. :( but I very much want to watch it. Micky Rooney is da best lol. But yeah. Ancuse to to get it."
3,Disappointed,I was sad to find out that when i got the third season The Black stallion to find the the 1st disc was covered in this movie. Thinking it was a new movie based off the T.V show. But at the same time i did enjoy the movie anyway.
1,Misleading product description,"The bulb being shipped is not the BL-FS300B lamp. As other reviewers have stated, the bulb being shipped is incorrect. I received the SP.83C01G001 bulb which is not an optoma bulb, nor is it a direct replacement for the BL-FS300B. Buyer beware."
3,"broad scope of content, but little depth","A large listing of 1002 websites that the publishers deem to be the best designed for 2004. A page of each site is shown. Typically, it is often the home page. While the book's CD shows these as actual webpages, so that you can best appreciate them in their intrinsic environment, instead of the printed page.Commendably, the book covers websites from all over the globe. But the drawback is that there is no commentary on what distinguishes a site. Broad scope of content, but little depth. The book might be far improved if the authors had also offered some analysis."
4,Inspirational,At the time i need a book of just different site design. And this was the one is was very Inspirational in helping get starting with sketches and layout just to get a fill for different concepts for sites.
3,Rodelinda,"The singing was superb, but when I bought it I was EXPECTING an epoch scenario instead of a very dark 1920's one. I would have wanted to know this before I bought it. Thank you. Maria"
4,This Is Good Soap,"I didn't use it on my face, but in the bath. It's very creamy, doesn't have a lot of bubbles, and it left my skin feeling smooth and moist. It also smells great. I would purchase again."
4,Coconutty good,"This soap is very easy on the skin. It lathers well, smells good but not overpowering and leaves a nice fragrance behind on your skin. It also makes your skin feel good, not drying at all. I would rate it as a very good thing to use in your shower."
5,Great Coconut Soap,This Skin Trip Coconut soap is more than just great smelling. It is top quality natural soap. I highly recommend this soap to all Coconut lovers. If you love the smell of Coconut then this product is for you!!
1,Awfulness,Terrible movie. All it is is a movie with average video. No words just music and it repeats itself in certain spots. I learned nothing new or even knew what island the movie was filmed on. Do not buy this. Boring. Snooze faces.
3,Good relaxation DVD,This Hawaii DVD shows beautiful scenery and wildlife. Unfortunately it doesn't give you the flexibility to set the scene to a specific option to run continuously. You have six viewing choices;Maui SunriseVolcanic CoastWaterfallsJungleFloraBeachesMy favorite is the beaches section which is very relaxing and beautiful. You don't have a choice to cancel the music and just listen to the ocean sound like on other DVDs. It's a good DVD to have when you want to zone out and meditate. If you're looking to get an overview of Hawaii this is a nice DVD choice. Enjoy!
1,Very disappointed with this,"I was very disappointed with this disc. The majority of the time it is showing ocean waves on cloudy or hazy days. There are also lots of ocean waves at sunset. You don't really see much of Hawaii in this, just the ocean. When it is not showing waves the shots were still taken on cloudy, hazy days. Very poorly done. I will not buy any products from this company."
2,Scenery plus nothing equals not much.,"This DVD has nice photography, but not much else. It does not tell you which Island you are seeing, or where you might be on that Island. There is no narration. I was very disapointed with the movie, and if I had to choose again, I would choose not to purchase this movie.I love Hawaii, but I did not love this movie. It could have been so much more if only they had taken the time to take viewers through a virtual tour of the Islands. But they didn't. Don't waste your money on this movie."
3,economic theory,"Bought this after reading discussion of Becker's theories in Gopnik's book, the Table. Written more for specialists than just casual interest. Price is right."
2,Can you hear me now?,"My boyfriend and I each got one of these in the hopes that it would end our search for a good bluetooth headset. We thought, cool design, good price, Motorola... Didn't quite work that way.We both agree that the unit is relatively comfortable, and the flip-out boom is a neat feature - makes for a very small unit when not in use. The buttons are also easy to use, and pairing is simple. Having the boom flip be the on/off is also a nice feature.Unfortunately, the thing that really matters - sound - isn't there. Even in my luxury SUV, I can barely hear anyone at freeway speeds, with the volume at max. He's got a sportier (read: noisier) SUV, so he can hear even less. We also both feel that fit has a lot to do with this. I, for one, ended up pushing the thing up against my ear, which improved the volume. The earpiece won't hold the unit in this position, though.So, both units will be going back where they came from this weekend. :("
3,Too early to tell.,"I just started taking this product last week, so it's too early to say how it will affect me. There's one thing I can say thought: It hasn't disagreed with me. This is HUGE, considering all the negative side-effects I've experienced while experimenting with nootropics during the last few weeks. So, hopefully, I've finally found a formula that will sharpen my mind and add to my well being, without turning me into a nauseated, head achy, quivery mess."
2,I Prefer the Original,"This book is good, and sure, you should buy it to complete your collection - but only after you buy the ORIGINAL WORK upon which this is based: The Dragon Legacy, by Nicholas de Vere. Gardner ripped off his entire theory from his colleague De Vere, but left out so many important details, trying to soften up the truth for a mass audience.If you want to find out what it really means to be of the Dragon bloodline - if you want to find out who the Nephilim or fallen angels really were, or the true nature of ""Starfire"" sex magic rituals like those performed by Jesus and Mary Magdalen - if you want to learn what the true relationship is between the Grail and Satan - read the original book by Nicholas de Vere. Gardner boils everything down to space aliens, and mangles the true history of the Dragons trying to please the Wiccan and New Age crowd that buys his books."
3,Genesis of thr Grail Kings,"For a non-scholar in this field, I found the book very difficult to follow in that it jumps from one reference to an other, and if not familiar with all these references it starts confusing you."
3,Great book IMO.,"Erm. I like the thoughts Gardner has, they really bring to light somethings I have been thinking about myself....I found it to be veryinteresting in that Gardner walks from the Annunaki on down through Jesus. The ""white powder"" has been found to exist, ORMES I believe it has been dubbed. Gardner theorizes that the powder (or rather, the gold before it is ground to powder, which is weghtless) was used to move the stone blocks of the pyramids. It is a very interesting read if nothing else, and will give you plenty to think about. END"
3,Some trenchant ideas smothered in Hocus Pocus,"I'll give this 3 stars. Gardner is a smart man and has a lot of things to say in his writings that I find have a lot of veracity. Suffice to say, it is unfortunate that he compromises his ideas here [I have no idea why perhaps he believes what he says-->] with Human etiology from space aliens, anti-gravitation, & human beings that live longer than Yoda. Serious dissapointment after reading the rational arguments put forth in Blood Line where he successfully demystified so much dogma only, here, to prop up another package of abracadabra. Gardner might solve a lot of puzzles. Too bad he shoots himself in the foot in the process."
5,A great piece of christian fantasy.,"As both an author and reader of fiction, I was impressed with Genesis of the Grail Kings. Maybe it is because I have always enjoyed a book that could hold my attention and make me think at the same time. In a nutshell, the characters are believable and yet a little out of the ordinary and the story line interesting. Give this book a try.I have also written a book about the cloning of Jesus, but my main story line is ten years in the life of a little girl who was ""chosen by God"" to be the next Madonna in the second coming of Christ.Tommy TaylorAuthor -The Second Virgin Birth"
4,Enjoyed this book,"I borrowed this book, and I'd advise doing the same. It's a quick reading book with some intresting ideas. Just not worth the 20 bucks."
4,Great Gospel,"I started out loving the upbeat songs on this album, but have also come to love the more reflective songs just as much. I always feel better after listening. Great talent, great spirit."
2,Floppy hose is a flop,"This hose works in the sense that it fits on 4"" fittings and air can usually flow through it, but the plastic reinforcement allows this hose to collapse if the angle gets too acute. I've recently had to replace a section of this hose with a metal reinforced hose."
4,Looks good - have not used it yet,"I have not actually used this hose yet.I have taken a good look and compared it to the hose it is replacing. THe function of the hose is for leaf vacuuming. It needs to be light, flexible, strong, and collapse- and abrasion- resistant. It appears to compare well to the old hose, so I have faith it will hold up pretty well. The old one lasted for about 5 yrs, so this should do pretty well, too."
2,Too flimsy,"After reading the high reviews (and ignoring the low reviews), I bought this hose for my dust collector. Since the port on my dust collector sticks straight up, the hose had to go up before looping towards the floor. After about an hour I noticed the hose was beginning to collapse at the top of the loop under its own weight. I was looking to replace the 6' hose that came with my dust collector with a longer section of hose. My original hose also has a plastic instead of metal spiral, but the plastic spiral on my original hose is much stronger. I had hoped to have a continuous hose, with no connectors, but I will have to reconnect my original hose to the dust collector and then attach a section of the new flimsy hose to the end of the old hose. If I hadn't already cut the hose, I would return it."
4,20 foot clear dust collector hose,The hose fits onto my 4 inch dust collection piping and is retained by a 4 inch clamp. Its a tight fit onto the piping. The other end fits very well onto my jointer(Delta) and my grizzly shaper (with a custom dust collection hood). A 4 inch to 2 1/2 reducer also fits a bit on the lose side but that may be due to the reducer. It is very easy to move the hose end from one machine to another and most times I do not need to clamp the machine end as the friction fit hold it in place most every time. It has only slipped off twice in the weeks I have been using the hose.Good hose and it is heavy enough for all the tasks that I need it to perform. I keep one on the long side and use it to vacuum the shop floor for wood chips. This one does not have a steel wire but rather is all plastic which makes it very easy to cut to custom lengths.
1,woodstock 4- inch by 20 ft.,"I did'nt even get it all the way out of the box, and I knew I made a mistake. Its all plastic and when you pull it out of the box its all kinked up, and forget about storing it in a small shop , if you curl it up it kinks. Im sending it back with a lesson learned, by the dust hose with the wire reinforcements."
3,This is an OK tennis instruction video,"This DVD is a good instrution video for player 3.5 or lower. For more advanced player or some one who wants to advance higher than 3.5, I don't think this is for them."
5,That is huge!,"The box is huge, I recommend this box. If you need a tool box for home or car. I like it!"
4,Good Quality,"Recently bought this set and I have to say that I am quite satisfied with it. Arrived quickly, well packaged and the price was pretty decent. The pieces are solid and work pretty well.Now for the bad news. When this arrives and you open it, you have to tear some plastic, since the pieces aren't already sorted. So you have to check each plastic pack and then figure out where in the case it goes. I spent a good hour sorting this out, since some parts have the same sizing.Apart from that, solid buy here and I do recommend it, whether for home, or vehicle or work use."
4,A Book you can feel,One of the things about this author's style is the unique alive sassiness of the poetry. Along with a deep sense of the poem's emotional magnitude.
4,nice upbeat collection,This is one of those times where I decided to take a chance and get something without listening to track samples ahead of time. Well I was pleasantly surprised to find that every track on this compilation were very upbeat and highly danceable tracks. There is a nice combination of styles so I never get bored and the mixing is 1st class. I spent about a buck plus postage and I'm a happy camper/raver!
4,Rosemarys baby strikes again.,"If you've never come across Peter James before, your missing a treat. This is more a supernatural thriller than a horror, and by the title of this review you can guess the general theme. What makes this a good read is the way its styled. Yes, you can guess the ending, as you can in most books once you've grasped exactly whats going on, but its how it comes about which keeps you on your toes.The ending, in truth (no pun intended) left me a little let down, hense 4 stars instead of 5, but for any fans of Herbert / King / Koontz out there, you should add Peter James to your must read list."
3,Interesting Marilyn Miller,"It's a fair copy, old and not exactly clear, but it's fun to see what Marilyn Miller was like and how she danced.I love old movies and seeing the old stars way before my time. They are the foundation of our musical heritage."
3,laaz rockit sorted rise to thrash form this powermetal?,"most people fing these first 2 cd shocking they sound more like powermetal/glam style la rock.But laaz rockit seams to do it better than than average with a few hints of what they'll become vital cd with bonuses for collectors but some will trash these classic cd for their LA glam sounds at points but don't underestimate these cd they have some great song and even pantera start out much the same style.alot of bigger bands put out the welcome matt for lazz rockit becaus they heard something great in their sound and songs.(metalilica,megadeth,slayer,exodus,testamant/legacy & dark angel)"
3,Stretch of Faith or Imagination,"I liked the first book, Angelspeake, a little better. There is some comfort about death in Heaven and Beyond, however. Perhaps for some communing with deceased loved ones is a possibility but for me it is a lengthy stretch. There are many accounts in this book of those who allegedly have done so. All this kind of material is so subjective one just has weigh and measure."
2,Frustrating! Not like the good ole drop and click view-masters!,"My grandson LOVES looking into his view-master... He's 3 and knows how to click the lever.. problem is with this one... 9 times out of 10 it won't advance, or only advances half a frame. On top of that, if you want to change the reel, you have to grab a screw driver and physically unscrew the top, change the reel, screw it back together and hope the next one will advance when clicked (nope). What a pain in the.... you know.We have looked through many stores trying to find the good old drop and click versions and couldn't find them anywhere.. I went to ebay and found plenty. I've got a set of 6 of them on the way (we're donating the extra to my grandson's classroom). He'll be very excited when he has one that works properly and he doesn't have to come to us every time he wants to change the reel."
2,Picture and Product don't match.,I hoped to get the style 3D Viewer pictured. Instead I received the older style. My e-mail inquiry to the seller went unanswered. Someone has their wires a bit crossed on this one. Don't try this product if you want the one shown in the picture.
2,Nice looking and inexpensive but cheap,"I bought these lamps for a rental house, so was attracted by their colonial look and low price. I wasn't looking for family heirlooms. They were time consuming to unpack, and the stem of one broke as I removed it from the packing, and there were minor chips in the bases of all 3. These couldn't have happened when I removed them from their styrofoam. They are inexpensively made, and the bases are soft and chip easily. As the rental house is on and island, and returning them would have required carting them back off the island-- I settled for 3 serviceable lamps. They look nice, and fit in with my colonial cottage. I don't expect them to survive more than a season or two of renters, but they will suffice for now. I think I will raise my price point for their replacements."
2,Quality less than expected,I was disappointed by the quality of this product. i didn't expect much given the price was low- but it is definitly not worth it.
3,Sing With The Georgia Mass Choir,"The album is pretty good. It has that ""James Cleveland"" style with a little Funk. The songs are great for church and community choirs. Stand-out songs are ""Rise, Shine, Give God The Glory"", ""Show Me The Way"" and ""I Will Be Ready"". Overall, I think it's a good album and should be purchased."
5,A Real Pleasure,"Jenny Bruce's new album, Soul On Fire, defies easy categorizing, in that it seems pop-folk, with some rock, and maybe sometimes a cabaret sound. Her lyrics are thoughtful and her melodies grab you. I have listened to it many times already.She has a wonderful voice. Amsterdam is a real winner, as well as Home, Running, and Amen. But it is all enjoyable."
5,Jenny Bruce is a rare gem!,"I came across Jenny's work through another artist's website. What a gem! I can't believe I'd never heard of her before. How is that possible? Soul On Fire is such a piece of quality work. Great writing, performances and production. Every song is a little masterpiece - try finding that on a major label release! If you like Shawn Colvin, Sarah MacLachlan you'll be amazed that you've never heard Jenny - and if you have I'm sure, like me you were drawn right in. I am just blown away and am looking forward to finding more work by Jenny Bruce!"
3,Tactical Mistakes,First off this is a good book on tactical puzzles. The bad side is there are a few or more mistakes in the answers. If you have a chess program that can analyze the diagram's then you will find the best answers. A couple of the diagrams were printed wrong. I give it a 3 for average. If it didn't have the printing errors and the errors in a few of the answers I would give it a 5 star rating.PawnMoves
4,If it weren't for one oversight...,This is a simple book. It presents tactical themes and some exercises for you to work out spotting tactics and executing calculations to win (or draw.)I agree with another reviewer in stating that a tactics book should not say what's the theme and let the reader identify it him/herself.I would normally give this book 5 starts but problem 101 is wrong as the authors missed the simple 1...Qf6+ 2.f6 Qxf6#
4,...,"The song Pulling On The Boots is originally by Squiggy. If you an find it, get it. Hear the real thing. Other than that, this is a good cd to have, a long with the original cut if the movie."
4,NOT SKREWDRIVER OR ANY OTHER BAND,I am a (WP)skin and these were studio made. Read the credits of the movie. It is not skrewdriver. It sounds nothing like Ian Stewart. The songs in the movie are pretty cool though. If you enjoyed the movie and the music you will enjoy this cd.
4,"Good, Not Great","I'm non-white, and a newbie to this Oi! thing, but I do like the fast pace of this musical genre, and I'm interested in getting more. Yes, it's a bit weird at first going along with lyrics of violence directed at people who look like me, but you know human beings get used to most anything. I'm just focusing on the music, I guess, the language of anger and frustration, of outrage and abandon, of illusions of grandeur and empowerment...LOL. As an introduction, I think this is a fairly solid way of broaching that Oi! scene, though I was hoping for maybe some new material...anyway, it is a soundtrack all right. Oddly, not much info was provided: no lyrics, the band ain't even listed...."
3,"Solid stuff, but not to be taken seriously","This is funny in a sick-joke, ironic way, but the music is high quality, brutal Oi! reminiscent of the Last Resort at their best. I'm a Marxist, so I listen to this and laugh at the stupid bonehead lyrics and I'd say it's still worth having just for comedy value."
2,Good Stolen Music,"I love how they don't list the bands who actually recorded these songs. That's theft as far as I'm concerned. They know no White Power music band would ever win a court case so they openly steal their material. The music is fantastic, so just watch the movie and look up the lyrics - get the songs from their original albums. Skip this compilation."
2,Disappointing. Very little new was revealed.,"The 5th Age Dragons are one of the most interesting parts of the current Dragonlance SAGA, yet nothing new or ""interesting"" is really revealed about them. Save your money for something else."
5,Lovely addition to any library,"Like others in the Everyman's Library Pocket Poets- lovely little book bound well and includes Plaths greatest works. Dust jacket is very pleasing and it looks great on the shelf too, definitely a book that looks nice on display whether a coffee table or bookshelf."
3,Proably above average perfume,"I love classic perfumes, like Chanel No. 5, Miss Dior, Faberge Tigress, Diorissimo and the similar Muguet Des Bois, but modern perfumes are just not as subtle, nor do they mature in quite the same fascinating way as the old perfumes.This one smells fabulous as it was first sprayed. Then I noted that it became rather pwerful and somewhat unpleasant and reminded me of something I was not able to quite place until a little later. Then, Raid came to mind! This perfume has a very strong Raid smell. I wonder what the ingredient in common with that bug destroyer is. I am quite serious. My husband agrees. Maybe if they could alter it and make it smell a little less chemical but rather more natural, it would make for a wonderful perfume."
4,Good mobile seat,"We bought this for my 90 year old father-in-law move around in his apartment without the trouble of the wheelchair. As soon as we got it, he had a turn for worse and never got to use it.I took it to work at the shop I work at and the mechanics have used it. It gets pretty low, but not always a low as some others. It does raise much higher than many though.When we got it, I didn't much care for the mounting of the wheels into the base. It seemed like the metal bolts and nuts weren't getting a good enough grip on the plastic bottom. I put some larger washers in there in hopes that the wheels wouldn't pull through the plastic. It's working so far, but I probably needed even bigger washers. I'm thinking that a top plate over the plastic would have been a better design.Still, it is recommended and the mechanics in my shop seem to like it."
1,The Crawler King Crawler Monster (rolling) seat is trash,I paid a higher price because I thought I would get a sturdy rolling seat this way. It has fallen apart. The wheels are just screwed into sheet metal and have one by one stripped the threads and it is now useless after a couple months. Very disappointing!
5,Operation Praying Mantis,I thought this naval action was brilliant and thorougly enjoyed reading this chapter.
3,"Great detail, would have liked less analysis","The good: A very detailed analysis of four battles (the last is more a series)that had a profound effect on American history. Minutely researched descriptions of the battles, their place in history, and how they affected American history. Great fir people who love naval history.The not so good: Anytime you try to extrapolate that one one naval engagement changed overall history (not just naval history) you are walking into the realm of conjecture. The author acknowledges this in the acknowledgements. I can definitely buy Midway being the turning point of the Pacific theater in World War II, and Hampton Roads certainly changed naval warfare forever, but I felt the conclusions were sometimes a bit of a reach. This was especially evident in the final chapter and epilogue."
3,Good Promo Item for Short Use,Purchased a few of these. All began to wear/break down after minor use. (Facing coming unglued...Ring detached.) Would last longer if you do not carry key chain in your pocket so you might want to get for someone that just carries keys around in purse or jacket.
1,Orion gadgets/pda extreme,"***do not order from Orion Gadgets/ PDA Extreme***. incorrect case sent twice - initially sent dell case not treo, then incorrectly sent treo case not as featured in pictures. picture notes flat back to case not with belt clip - belt clip treo case sent. poor customer service."
5,ANOTHER GREAT ARKENSTONE RECORDING........,THIS IS JUST ANOTHER WONDERFUL EXAMPLE OF DAVID ARKENSTONE'S MANY TALENTS. THE MUSIC IS ALIVE AND YOU FEEL YOU ARE THERE IN TIBET.A MUST HAVE FOR ARKENSTONE FOLLOWERS.....
1,SUX!!!!!!!,"I can't believe how bad this game is!!!!! The graphics look like Nintendo 64 graphics, and the enemies die after 2 hits, you run out of ammo to quickly , and the storyline makes no sense!!! A horrible game!! DON'T EVEN WASTE MONEY RENTING IT!!! STAY AWAY!!"
4,Not totally bad for a kid,"My 10 year old bought this game and he is having a blast with it. For the people who like blood and gore, there is no blood. They are little green soldiers which are actually toy soldiers on a mission on the beach in various sand castles with soda cans, starfish, sand shovels and other things you may find on a beach. The graphics aren't great but they are kind of funny when you think about the missions. Toy soldiers that melt when they get too close to fire. You have to find the enemies flag, war plans and you have to blow things up. Fun for kids since it isn't realistic and they're only plastic toy soldiers which most boys play with."
5,I Am A Writer,"Judy Reeves is a superb teacher and I have taken courses with her for many years. In truth, it was Judy who inspired me to pursue this creative endeavor.Her multiple strategies for both writing alone and joining write groups are inspirational. Judy offers practical advise. At the same time she encourages anyone who wants to write to reach for the stars."
5,Inspirational Gem,"I enjoyed this book immensely. It has wonderful tidbits on how famous writers work (e.g., who writes in the nude), uplifting qoutations about writing (from sources famous and not), and terrific practical tips (e.g., what to do for writer's block). There all also hundreds of intriguing story topics to enable both amateur and expert to start writing immediately. Reeves' book is hugely encouraging yet gentle, inspirational yet humorous. Every time I read a chapter of the book, I want to set everything aside and write all day and night, full of confidence and enthusiasm for the work at hand. I'm thrilled to have discovered this gem."
3,Romance writers BEWARE,"Reeves' book is excellent. Almost. I was quite enjoying it. And then I came to her out-of-the-blue, uncalled for slam against romance writers. She even stoops to calling our books bodice rippers, a term that has not applied for nearly 15 years. It was a cheap shot, one she did not deliver to sci-fi or mystery or other genres. Only romance. As a romance writer myself, I was deeply insulted."
5,I wish I'd written it!,A calendar of writing exercises and observations that address the body/mind/spirit of the writer and his/her writing. You will not be able read the book without writing. Don't skip ahead. Do them one page at a time.
1,"Oh God, This is So Bad","Worst collection of poetry in the history of the world. Open it anywhere, and you'll laugh aloud and triteness, political correctness, and nonsense."
1,"Old fashioned book, not suitable for VS880ex",This book was a waste of money. I have the VS880EX and the book which is supposed to be new is completely out of date. Spend your money on another cable....
1,bad value,not sure what 51 oz means I received one pack with 3 units and cost was well above regular store costs
2,"Great smell, but...","What is not shown here is that this is in fact gel warmer refill. I ordered thinking it was oil. But, boy does it smell great!!!!! I only wish they had oil with this scent.."
1,What a ripoff and very diseptive,"I expected a shipment of nine boxes and I got 3. This add needs to be edited and the false advertising should be checked out by Amazon, before listing such. This seller needs to look at their ad."
2,DVI output,"Unfortunately, the port replicator was purchased for its DVI output, yet the port replicator does not work. When returned to Sony, they advised the current chipset in the Sony model does not support DVI. I bought the Sony specifically for the availability of the DVI output on the port replicator"
4,Playboy,"For a 40 year old magazine, it was in excellent shape. I bought it as a gift, and it was well received."
4,An in-depth look into the mind of Michael Jordan,"This book answers the question that millions of people were thinking when Jordan quit basketball: What was HE thinking! With everything from his first retirement and death of his father to his attempt at baseball and return to the NBA, Greene's book lets you know exactly what Jordan was thinking during this period of time and his reasoning behind everything. A good book!"
3,Soso book,"It explored some issues, like is Jordan a ballhog, but not in depth. It is average quality. I wouldn't recommend it, but I wouldn't disparage it either."
2,ick!,"This book mainly talks about Jordan's father. Sure he was a main part of his life and all, but... come on. I was looking for a biography, tell more about his life. How did he get to the Bulls? Where's the rest of his family through this book? The author mainly talks about conversations with Jordan...Which i found quite boring. Its just my opinion, maybe someone else shares it too..."
5,Superb,"I saw this program on a PBS station recently, and it's stunningly produced, covering not only her life, but her music. If you're an ELLA fan, this is perfect. But even if you're not, it's worth looking at from a cultural perspective, as she played SUCH a role in SO many lives."
5,ELLA WAS AND STILL IS THE FIRST LADY OF SONG,"Something To Live for is filled with some of the best moments in popular music, I really enjoyed the duet with Frank and Ella ''the lady is a tramp'', she was one of the best, this dvdis informative and enjoyable, if you're a fan of jazz or just getting into it this dvd is a must, THE FIRST LADY OF SONGwill be missed but never forgotten."
2,Very abstract.....,"The textbook is from 1966. The information contained in this text is all technical. The worked examples sometimes are not thorough, however they are complete. The examples do not help with the exercises. There is no selected answer section at the back of the book. If you are new to or rusty on writing proofs, this is not the book to work from."
5,Adobe CS review,Excellent book for leading me through using the software. Glad I found such an older edition for my older software version.
3,"Curb Your Enthusiasm, and Relax Your Expectations...","As an action film, Bloodmoon succeeds in almost every aspect of what a martial arts movie is supposed to be. But from the perspective of a HK cinema fan, the film is constantly bogged down by the flaws of bad filmmaking and low-production quality due to a low-budget.My advice to you, the viewer, is that when you buy this film to add to your collection or rent it from a local rental outlet, just sit back and relax, and enjoy the greatly improved style and quality of martial arts action that is hardly ever seen from a US production studio; Whatever you do, do not take this film seriously! And finally, when you get to the end of the film, be prepared for one of the worst endings ever conjured for an action film!OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS: Cold Harvest, Fatal Blade, and China Strike Force (English Language Version)."
4,Blood moon for DVD,"This is got to be one of the best Gary Daniels movies that Ive seen so far. The acting is bad, the story is bad, the special effects are bad, but the action and martial arts scenes are way above average. Buy this movie for those two reasons only because is definently delivers. After this you should buy Cold Harvest and Fist of the North Star. Those are also two of Gary Daniels Best. (And when you watch Blood Moon keep in eye out for the Boom Mike)its just hilarious!"
4,pretty good martial arts flick,"this is one the jewels among american chop socky films....the fight scenes a pretty darn good except for the weak wire work..gary daniels and ""eddie murphy""(heh heh) put on a good show....but our badguy was the kind i love ,real nasty.....hey did anyone catch ron van dame?"
5,Good Behind the Scenes Video,"This is a good behind-the-scenes VHS tape of GOLDFINGER. It has rare footage, trailers, TV spots, interviews and comentary on the movie. This is a first rate official production. A must for Bond fans."
4,I liked it too!,"Very sexy story and lots of entertaining moments. Be sure to get Women in Trouble and watch it first. They don't tell you that Elektra Luxx is the second part of the two-movie set. Too much 'Go woman power"" preachiness but it's a movie about a famous (fictious) porn star. Has a lot of beautiful women in it and they are just barely dressed. Worth a look."
1,truly horrible...,"I am by no means a movie critic and I usually like the cheesy, low-budget movies (at least of particular genres), but this movie is certainly in the bottom 10% of movies I have ever seen. Don't waste your time. No good ""views"" of anyone, the acting was horrible and overall had no redeeming qualities!"
5,Performance as good as the original,I am glad that I bought this battery since the original one from Sony costs more than $200. With my general preference for original accessories so high I took a risk (or so I thought-with no review for this battery when I was deliberating) when I went in for the duracell battery. But I'm more than happy with this 'duplicate' battery as its life is as good as the Original Sony Battery. Recommended.
1,Don't Even Think About It,"I ordered this item and was extremely angry once I opened it. It looks nothing like what it does in the picture. The picture shows it with various animal prints. When I got it, it was just one print: snow leopard. Also, once I put it on my steering wheel, it immediately began to rip by the seams. It wasn't too tight, just snug. It was very thin. It also shed like no other. Avoid buying this product, It's not worth it."
1,Completely wrong product,"I ordered the Safari steering wheel cover, but instead received just a gray cheetah print only steering wheel cover. I know that gray cheetah is in the print, but it's not ONLY cheetah. I was so excited to open my package, but quickly became upset and frustrated to find the completely WRONG product. Definitely want my money back and the product I actually ordered."
1,false picture,"i ordered this expecting to receive the cover as pictured. when i got it, it was nothing like the picture. its just cheetah print and very tacky looking. not worth your money"
1,Horrible!!!!!,I did not get the steering wheel cover that I ordered and I am not happy about it at all. I have been waiting for days for my package to come and when it gets here it is totally the wrong thing!! I am not happy at all and very mad! I want the correct steering wheel cover that I ordered!!!!!
2,cheap made,"As by the price I paid I didnt expect great, but the first time I put this on my steering wheel, it came apart. I tried sewing it back together, but it just wouldnt fit tightly to the steering wheel. I didnt go through the hassel of returning it, i just tossed it aside."
2,You get the quality that you pay for,This was not the right design. instead of a mixture it was just the cheetah. I do not recommend this. strings were comings all off of it and when it was on the wheel it streched weirdly over the steering wheel.
1,DONT GET IT,"I ordered this product and was very estatic to open it up, but come to find out it was nothing like the picture. I was very dissapointed. I bought a whole entire cheeta set relying on that steering wheel cover and to come to find out, it wasn't what I though it would be. This is FALSE ADVERTISMENT. I hope you don't make my same mistake in buying this. I also hope you read this before you buy it! Because of this product I don't trust Amazon fully anymore and will now read the comments before I buy something, if I do.."
5,Nice!,Works very well. No problems at all. Easily recognizes all of my equipment. File transfers are fast.
4,"works fine, but don't trust the manual if using with vista","I second the positive reviews, but after spending almost a day to make it work with Vista (which, as many forums show, has its quirks with Bluetooth), I recommend the following: DON'T listen to the manual or download the latest software from the manufacturer right away. FIRST, just plug in the adapter and then follow the instructions that Vista gives you after the ""new hardware found""-pop up appears, it will guide you through all the required downloads. Then it is pretty easy and works perfectly fine."
2,"Caused Blue Screen Crash, limited range","I read the reviews and was impressed with Vista compatibility. I used it to connect to a Bluetooth headset for use with Skype. Install disk is useless, downloaded driver/software as recommended by others. Once working, the range was minimal, much static beyond 10 feet, so ok if sitting near desk. Biggest problem was the fact it crashed my laptop 3 times...I'm returning it."
3,Not for epson printers,This item does not work with epson rx700 printer the bluetooth from radio shack did. It works fine with my desktop using xp. See's my kodak 500 printer and sony ericsson t226 phone. Able to send and receive midi songs and pictures to phone.
5,Very high quality,"Very impressed with the product quality and timeframe in which I received product. Overall, would definitely buy again from supplier."
4,Works Great!!,This item worked great for the reason purchased - sync Palm Tx and Blackberry. No choice since Palm does not support Vista 64.
2,Difficult to set up,"This = IOGEAR Enhanced Data Rate Class 2 Bluetooth USB Adapter Ranges up to 66 FeetHave two LTs (Thinkpad/Dell) both of which claim to support bluetooth.Also have bluetooth logitech mouse which should work with them. (And a bluetooth headset)Could never get them to pair (either LT). Googling pointed many frustrated users.Bought myself two IOGEAR USB adapters - one mini (longer range), one micro.This one - worked only with Dell LT. Did not work with thinkpad. Although all drivers are installed.The IOGear Bluetooth USB Micro Adapter (GBU421) worked fine with both LTs (and both mouse/headset), and being compact, no need to remove from LT."
3,"it works, but will slow your internet and other programs","it worked right out of the box. But it was the cause of all the slowness in my computer. after unplugging it, everything was back like normal."
4,works fine with vista,"I bought this item to upgrade my toshiba pc premium vista, which doesn't support bluetooth technology. Even though this version of the adapter doesn't include vista drivers (only Windows 2000/XP) they're downloadable from the manufacturer website. I use the adapter to pair up with a S9 motorola headset and the the conexion is ok, with no drops at all and a big range of reception.The only drawback I find for this product is the lack of 'tap' for the adapter. It comes exactly how you see it in the picture, so it has no protection for the plug."
4,Worked like a charm,I bought this to transfer pictures from my LG 600 Net 10 phone to my computer. Installation was a piece of cake with the drivers CD for Windows XP. Getting my phone to acknowledge the computer was more challenging- never having done this before. Once I figured it out the transfer was no problem. The only drawback I can see is that the dongle does not come with a cover or cap for the USB connection end.
4,Just what it looks like it will be,"I still haven't figured out how this company offers these rings with decent stones at these prices. This ring, although having a darker ""sapphire"" than expected, is just what I wanted."
5,My Impressions,"Being devoted to the classical arts and trained as artist myself I am refreshed to hear Ms, Ganjoula's performance and the obvious level of commitment required to achieve such an understanding of music. I especially enjoyed her rendition of Alexander Borodin's Au Convent. And her album is my first exposure to Lyadov's work, ""What a Pleasure!"" I enjoy it more each time I hear it. I hope so much to hear more form this talented woman in the near future. Does she have anymore works out there?Sincerely,Raissa"
5,Only vitamin my dog will eat,I have been using these vitamins for over 2 years. It is the only vitamin one of my dogs will eat. Check out the dancing paws website if you are concerned about the lack of info on the label. They are a company wholly commited to your pets overall health.
1,BEWARE OF THIS DVD,"Just to let u all know the dvds being released by this company are previous dvd releases and they've remarketed them with these new dvd names!The dvd you will find in this set is in fact""Sessions From The Vaults Vol.1""So please be aware of this when buying dvds from these people, the Crucial Elements dvd contains""Montreal Reggae Festival:In The Begining Vol.2"""
3,Eh?,If your buying this for big tough projects this isnt the set you want. Its more of a household set for household projects. I used this set to modify my quad trailor and all the big bits either got dull after one use or they chipped and as far as the small ones go there alright but brake quite fast.
2,Questionable Quality,"When the drill case was opened the number drills were scattered all over the inside of the case. I spent almost an hour checking the diameter of each bit so that is could be returned to holder. During the checking, found several of the sizes between 42 and 60 could not be distinguished from size from another using calibrated micrometer and vernier. Duplicates or poor quality?????The rack holding the numbered bits was not attached to the case lid. Bases on the dimensions of the rack and the case lid, the machine screws provided were too short.Bit angle to spec so I assume they will cut the material for which they are intended.The casing is poor quality and very bad design and the racks do not open far enough to see the bit size. Case design needs to be reviewed and the quality of manufacture must be up-grade. That little voice told me the price was to good to be true."
1,Dull out of box,Will not cut steel. Junk..... 15 day warrantee ......how is that for confidence in your product. I did not think to open and test immediately so they will not allow return. I'm shocked amazon would allow such poor quality on their site. I have purchased tens of thousands of dollars of tools and parts on amazon........normally they are of good quality.
1,Wasted Money,"Wanted a drill bit index, didnt care about the cheap quality bits, I figured they would be one and done. The index is crap too. It came bent and the bolts that held letter bit index had fallen out. Took about 1/2 hr to get it back together."
2,Barely acceptable set,"This set is a good starter set for an occasional user who might need every possible drill size. It is a good value for that purpose.However, for any regular use, there are serious problems with this set:The smaller bits (below about 3/16"" or .187) are very easily broken. The product description claims they are high-speed, strong, and durable. They are none of these things. The larger bits dull easily. Some of the small bits (numbered above 40) are duplicated drill sizes in slightly different lengths.The case is tough and durable, but is not easily used. The small bits in the back (the numbered bits) are difficult to get out of the holder. It requires two hands, which is often a problem during project. The tray for the numbered bits does not fold open but can be pulled forward about an eighth of an inch to remove or replace the bits."
4,drill set,My son-in-law was pleased to receive this as a gift for Christmas. I was glad it came in time.
5,You're going to love this!,"If you have not heard Beegie and her trio play, you are in for a treat. This lady plays great standards with an easy swing and excellent arrangements. I have 99% of Beegie's recordings, and every cut is tastefully performed. If you can't afford the whole collection, then you might want to introduce yourself to her music by purchasing the Sinatra or Nat Cole albums. You can't go wrong with any of Beegie's recordings. Enjoy!"
4,Good 'til the end.....,"Starts out good, and the songs blend together in a creamy mixture but with a powerful punch. ""Arbitrator"" has amazing lyrics, and ""Vanishing"" has amazing vocals and BGV's, and ""Suspension My Love"" has an amazing transition of sounds. Then ""Bobby's Song"" hits us, which is good, but far from amazing. Then the songs go off into a punk free-for-all(Nothing as impressive as the amazing first bunch of songs). Its amazing because they are just as smooth live."
5,"Make Em Laugh, Make Em Cry, Make Em Wait","Television is the grandchild of vaudeville, but for decades vaudeville ignored television. This documentary -- the first ever television program about vaudeville -- is an enhanced version of a 1997 PBS broadcast, part of the American Masters series. For rights reasons, some of the songs -- like ""Frankfurter Sandwiches"" -- are missing from the original broadcast, but they've been replaced by either other songs or more spoken word routines. Segments from almost ninety acts are included -- in 1997 People Magazine said this was one of the twelve best television programs of the year, and the best entertainment special of the year -- that for a show where most of the performers haven't been seen for thirty years. Also included are interviews with more than thirty vaudevillians, including June Havoc, Morey Amsterdam, Rose Marie, George Abbott, and the Nicholas Brothers. I think it's a splendid show, but then I should; I wrote and directed it."
3,okay but not especially worth ordering online for,"I really like Moutain Ocean products and am disappointed that they are not available at Whole Foods or my local organic store, Roots. I really love the body cream and have used it for years. The shampoo and conditioner are not all that special though to pay for the shipping costs. The soap is too expensive for me to consider buying it."
2,"I Love Mountain Ocean's Other Products, not this one.","Since I love mountain ocean's other soaps and lotions, I thought this shampoo would be great too, but it is almost exactly like Johnson and Johnson's baby shampoo, and it does not smell good. If you need a shampoo that won't leave stuff in your hair, stick with Dr. Bronners."
2,Coconut?,I was fooled by the title Mountain Ocean Coconut Shampoo - I thought it would be similar to their Skin Trip: NOT. Mistake
1,Please read carefully!,"I think the card could be a little dated, cause they are referring to speed. And it's a 16bit card, & most everything now a days is 32bit. Also look where it talks about the features. It said: Easy Plug and Play installation--automatically configures I/O addresses and IRQs Well according to the User's Manual I quote: Attention: This card is NOT PLUG-N-PLAY. The default jumper setting need to be changed to new settings. Inserting this card without completely reading over the manual will result in possible CONFLICTS AND IMPROPER OPERATION of system hardware. Also no where on the Box does it say PLUG-N-PLAY. The problem is I had to order it, before I got the correct needed info. What a hassle, shipping & handling & all. I don't have nothing against the product, but I feel the product was miss represented. Plug-n-Play is not a buzz word that can be applied to everything. We need CORRECT information on ALL products, & preferably a little more in depth."
3,Good and simple; now its falling apart,"Bought this three years ago for my then four year old. Very simple and was exactly what we were looking for. The only problem at the time was that we received two ""left"" legs and ended up just making do with it. Didn't seem to affect the structure at all. But now, the wood has swelled and the slats do not fit snugly anymore and are falling off continually. We haven't contacted the manufacturer yet but will be doing that soon. Will update as soon as we do."
3,Bed frame and trundle,"I bought the bed frame and recommended trundle. I did not realize the trundle was from a different vendor and arrived well after I had assembled and painted the platform bed. The problem is the trundle does not fit under the bed frame so now I have a useless piece of furniture for which I bought a mattress. This is pretty frustrating. Alone, each product is just fine but beware on buying the trundle. Do not assume it will roll under the bed frame."
5,"Excellent bed, well designed, great price.","I've been looking for a twin platform bed for about a month, and most of what I've found was too expensive, or if it was low price, had bad reviews due to the difficulty in assembling the bed. This bed looked great in the picture, and the price was just what I wanted to spend, however there was no customer feedback, so I was a little worried about buying something that would be difficult to assemble. When I got the bed I asked my daughter to help me put it together, in case there were issues, but while I was reading the one page instructions, she reviewed the parts and then told me we didn't need the instructions. She was right, it took ten minutes to put it together, all of the pieces come together with ease, no pounding, pushing, struggling to make things fit. The bed itself is beautiful, looks just like the picture, is sturdy, and well designed. Overall this was an excellent buy."
4,Inspiratonal,Reading this memoir helped me remember how precious life is. Captain Burk is a extraordinary man and I've learned somevaluable insights from reading this to carry with me.
5,The Bridge Never Crossed,"After meeting the author in person,reading his book was as powerful as listening to him speak.Mr.Burk takes you on a journey that only a true survivor would attempt. His stop at the Bridge is the starting point for us all !"
4,Perspective and Renewed Appreciation,"This is what 'The Bridge Never Crossed' gave me - perspective and renewed appreciation. Reading George's amazing story of survival and triumph will give you an appreciation for what you have in life and what you take for granted. His experiences certainly provide one with a new perspective from which to view the daily challenges faced by most of us. Those challenges suddenly seem minor and insignificant in the context of George's story. I'm in awe of what he has overcome, of how deep his reserve of strength was and how he found a silver lining to a nightmare. His story will get you through those ""bad days""."
3,"He Said,She Said,They Said,They Lied,She Lied,He Lied","Anyone from the mid '90's would remember when the story broke that Hollywood's ""Black Book"" could be exposed when young ""Madame"" Heidi Fleiss was arrested for pandering to the ""Millionaire Row"" of Hollywood's elite.Nick Broomfield's BBC documentary gives you insight into the three major players in this scandal;Heidi Fleiss,film director and boyfriend Ivan Nagy and former Hollywood Madame Head,Madame Alex.Everyone has their own versions of the events,NATURALLY.They all may be lying and they all may be telling some version of the ""truth"".You will gain some insight, but the documentary is extremely repetitive in it's information and interviews and ultimately quite dull."
3,All over the place but entertaining.,Never got any clear cut picture of what really went down with Heidi's operation.Still parts of was entertaining.
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS FROM WHERE I BOUGHT IT, OR WHAT, BUT I WASN'T TOLD IT WOULD BE A HARD COVER BOOK. I WANTED A REAL MANUAL. IT SHOWS SOME STUFF, BUT NOT WHAT I REALLY WANTED OR EXPECTED. IF POWERSPORTS DIDN'T SUCK SO BAD, I WOULD OF TRIED TO RETURN IT."
1,Fat Ego Trip,"Don,t get this dvd mixes are bad camera jerks all around. I dont think people are having much fun.A good idea but very poor outcome. I recommend ""Underworld-Everything everything"" this is hot rave pounding engaging music as is MobyPLay ,which is a must."
5,Better than what they say,"I have no idea what got mixed in with the other reviewers' coffee. This DVD is ubelieveable. First, it has enough extras to keep a fatboy fan happy (type 303 to see a half hour backstage clip) and the music is great. He certainly mixes throughout the whole thing despite what other reviewers say. You won't be disappointed."
4,Fatboy Slim is fawking in heaven..:),"Whoa, this is it. The track listing is insane and to see that amount of people at one party is amazing. And the production is just killer on the DVD along with some really cool features. The interview with Norman is just hysterical as well,. This is definitely a must for any house head or straight up music lover."
2,More Like Goth 2001,"This movie has absolutely nothing to do with Stevie Nicks. And as far as I can remember, Stevie never hung around with a Robert Smith-loving monkey who acts like Chris Kattan's gothic character ""Azrael Abyss"" from Saturday Night Live. I'm assuming Gypsy 83 just couldn't get the rights to any Stevie Nicks or Fleetwood Mac music, because this film might have been a tad better if they ever sang or listened to any of her music except for the forgetful tune, ""Talk to Me."" Poor Gypsy Vale of Sandusky, Ohio looks more like a goth queen than La Nicks but I will give her (or her buddy Clive aka Azrael) props for recreating the white-dress-and-boots look from the ""Bella Donna"" album cover. Oh, and did I mention this film is terrible?"
1,Piece of Garbage,"I saw this movie and was utterly disappointed. Rent something else and don't waste your time. Also, be forewarned, there is a soft core porn section of the movie where you see Sara Rue and a guy having sex in a bathroom and the male star and his new male friend having sex in another bathroom. I had to fast forward. Definitely could have gone through my life without seeing THAT!I also expected Stevie Nicks music given the main character's obsession with the artist and the fact that they were on their way to a Night of 1000 Stevies. That was actually the deciding factor on ""to rent or not to rent."" Perhaps Stevie felt not the need to lend her music to this piece of garbage. The movie, simply put, was not nearly described accurately enough. Had it been, it would have stayed on Blockbuster's shelf and out of my DVD player!"
3,you could be a very pretty girl,"While this film wasn't brilliantly shot or written, I really felt the themes addressed in it were provocative and convincing. The plot stumbles all around the many ways we love people, how it's not always apparent how love can manifest, and how love just happens, regardless of bits, orientations, or situations. The quest of the two main characters is fairly predictable, though it meandered offroad quite a lot in the middle. Ultimately it's not a tidy ending, but it's the one that is right for these people. In that light I am interested in seeing other of Todd Stephens' work."
4,Beautiful!,"A really good, beautiful movie. Sara Rue was amazing as Gypsy and Kett Turton was so sweet in this movie. A dynamic duo!I've written a more in-depth review of the movie here:[...]"
1,Half-Baked Book!,"The Users Manual claims to be a thorough approach to NLP theory. It is in fact quite the opposite! I am a certified NLP practicioner,among my students are Ross Jeffries,Tony Robbins,Emile Tushman and many others. Bandler himself has many times called me in for consultations.He is a dear friend. Grinder,I can do without. Now this book tells us NOTHING of transpersonal bifurcation. Nothing on linguistic ramification,or interior intellectual stabilization,or sexually diverse incorporation. It just barely touches on speciation and has little of note to say about cross-cultural integration.The information it does present is riddled with errors and out-dated information. If you want to move up to become a true NLP afficianado,this is one book you must avoid!!"
3,Pretty good book. Kind of like having a Practitioner Manual to work from.,This is a pretty good book. I like it. This is what I would term L. Michael Hall style NLP though which there is nothing wrong with because in a sense whenever someone teaches something they do it in their own way and they always highlight what they think is most important to focus on. I would recommend this book for people that are looking for a reference in which get an idea of what should be covered in a NLP Practitioner Certification. This is a great reference to work from but don't expect to learn NLP from a book. NLP is really something that a person needs a good trainer to teach them. I liken it to trying to learn a Martial Art from a book it's just not the same thing as training at a school under the supervision of a good teacher.
3,Nice to have but could do without,"Its not a major page turning book, no new concepts but nicely lay out for most readers to enjoy."
5,The Best NLP Practitioner Manual,"I have been involved in NLP for some time and teach NLP in Canada. This is the manual I use when I'm teaching my NLP Practitioner courses and the one I recommend when people ask for a book to help them understand NLP. It is well written, clear and succinct. All of the major exercises are here and the instructions are excellent. It is obvious that Bob Bodenhamer and Michael Hall have used this material extensively and their book reflects this. They have a deep understanding of their subject matter and how to present it. If you want to know about NLP, understand how it works and what a practitioner program entails, get this book."
3,Too deep - for practitioners trying to cure someone,"This is a book that starts very well, describing every aspect of NLP - Eye Cues, Words, phrases, commands, types of personality (Kinesthetic, Visual, Auditory and Digital... this lattest one being totally diferent than other books on the subject).The think is... after 1/3 of the book is read, you start getting the long, abstract and theoretical stuff about NLP.So I recommend this if you are a student, a practicioner and want to become ""certified"" - like in a psychology/hipnotist course.Do NOT buy this book if you want practical advice, easy to follow tips for your personal life or business career.Think of this book as a theoretical guide that your college teacher you'd recommend... You will know a lot of theory but not much about applying it to everyday life.Anyway, a very solid, thourough, detailed and complete book on theoretical NLP.(As you might have guessed, I was looking for a more practical guide)."
4,"Good effort, sloppy execution.","The ""Users Manual for the Brain"" claims to be a comprehensive review of NLP techniques. It lives up to this claim, but, it appears poorly edited and the illustrations/diagrams often appear separate from the text they are intended to amplify.If the authors review and update the ""Manual"", it would be wise to run a spelling and grammar check. A few hours spent judiciously editing a new edition would probably earn it another star."
2,Disappointed.,"Honestly, I only got to page 35 in this 400 page book. To this point, at least 3 times I had to scratch my head, reading about something with terminology that had not been defined. At all. And, if this book is about the different styles of communication, it was poorly written for Visual Types who make up 60% of people. The pictures and diagrams are few and not very good, in my opinion. Finally, the book was unable to hold my attention or interest which doesn't speak well for a book about excellence."
2,"nice sound, but very annoying to operate","Very VERY nice sound quality from this system, but it's kinda quirky. My main issue with it at the moment is that if there is no disc in one of the slots then it won't let me put a new one in. I've been wrestling with it all day. It may just be this player; it seems that nobody else has reported this problem."
5,no sound from TV,"Hi There! I hooked up the system to my TV (a regular toshiba 21 inch tube TV, bought new 2 years ago!) using the yellow, white and red cable (whihc i bought seperately)..but cant get the tv sound coming thro the speakers..i followed the manual instructions but still doesnt work..someone please help..thanks!DVD etc works gr8..sound is awesome..price..bought it from BB (B&M;) and used a 10% off coupon..my total..188$..cant beat that!!"
3,Bass and treble control and digital inputs,Good stuff but there is no control for bass and treble and also lacks digital inputs.Joao
4,You CAN get surround sound from your TV,"This is a great little system for the price...Sam's Club had it for $259. I read in previous reviews that some could not get surround sound to come from their TVs (I have Comcast HD cable)...you CAN too...mine is hooked up and VERY nice. DVDs, CDs, TV sound...all in surround sound. I am a 54-year old grandmother whose husband thinks I know better how to do all this stuff...well, I don't know that much, but I do know that you can get surround sound from your TV with this system."
4,good acquisition,"I received the right product, in the real time. I like to get product in black Friday. I recommend to get product in your site."
3,Sony Home Theater,The system had a great sound but the remote control would not work with my TV. So I sent it back with no problems. TIM
5,very very good,"very good product is very good sound is a very good option, if we sound quality and the price is the best option"
4,Lots of Features for The Price,"This thing is great! The upconversion on the DVD player is fantastic!Easy to hookup. Klunky menu, but once you figure it out you can control all aspects of video, sound, etc."
4,SOUNDS GREAT,"THIS SYSTEM DIGITAL SOUND IS GREAT , AND THE UPCONVERTER DVD PLAYER LOOKS GREAT TOO .THE BAD THING IS THERES NO OPTIC SOUND PORT AND YOU CANT USE YOUR PS3WITH IT."
3,too easy to reset,"This looked like a well built product, but the combination was too easy (at first, seemed too difficult) to reset, and resulted in me inadvertently changing the combination rendering the lock unusable. I tried giving it another chance and tried to find the combination (only 9999 total shouldn't take too long, right?) but gave up and returned it.The cable seemed well built and the directions were clear enough, but the reset mechanism was so simplistic it was too easy to trigger accidentally. I feared this would happen out on the road, so back it goes."
1,Would rate negative stars if available,"You reset the combo by twisting the end. While locking or unlocking your bike, the you can accidentally twist the end and unintentionally change the combo. That is what happened to mine. I used it a few times, then once when trying to remove it from my bike, the combo I set stopped working. I have no idea what the new combo is. I'll have to cut the lock off my bike.Buy a different lock."
2,you get what you pay for,"This is one of the cheapest bicycle locks on the market. It is very small and lightweight (about 6 ounces). However, the amount of protection it provides is very low. The cable can be snipped pretty easily with bolt cutters. The combo lock can be defeated pretty easily by feel. If you're going to run into a restroom or convenience store for just a minute of if you're watching your bike from a nearby cafe table, this lock may be enough to slow a thief down. I would not trust this lock if I'm going to be away from my bike for an extended period of time."
2,They sent me the wrong color,I bought this lock to match my Black and Yellow bike as it the picture in the advertisement was showing same colors. What they sent me was a grey version of the lock which is pretty ugly . The lock is cheaply made and perfectly matches it's price tag ! I'm not recommending this lock to anyone.
1,Resets Easily,"This lock inadvertently resets the combo due to it's design, the reset tab is basically right by the number tabs so user error will be often. The first time this happened, my wife figured out that the combo went one number off, today was a disaster since I could not figure out where the numbers were re-set to. Basically, I have to cut off the lock now because who the hell knows what the combo is now for this inferior product, at the same time, the lock looks so weak that it might just get cut off by a thief overnight while it's stuck at my work (sigh)."
2,"Very weak lock, bike stolen the first night we used it","If you don't live in a high-crime area and all you need is a light lock to dissuade a kid from joy-riding, fine. But if you need any kind of protection from thieves who know what they're doing, get a u-lock, not something like this."
3,Lock's middle numbers are stuck together,"This means that you only have 3 number combinations, since the middle 2 numbers are always stuck together (two 00's or two 11's, etc). Not what I paid for. But otherwise it seems ok."
2,"Cheap metal, easy to break the lock.","The metal that makes up the 'key/chuck' part snaps off with a good jerk of the cable. Went to grab my bike off the rack and forgot it was chained, barely felt the snap. When I looked the key is only cast not forged.Was Happy with the lock for several years but now I'll be getting one that is not so easy to break."
5,Great minimum security lock with combination that can be reset.,"This is a great item to use to protect your bike for a short while in a low-risk situation. I carry one in the underseat bag of my road bike and use it when I stop to run in to a 7-11 or a cafe. Be aware that it in no way replaces a U-lock plus cable setup, which I also have and use anytime I have to lock my bike overnight or in an unsafe area. This lock is what you want when you want to simply discourage someone from simply walking away with your unlocked bike.Note that Kryptonite makes a similar item which is actually a bit smaller and less bulky. I prefer the OnGuard lock because you can reset the combination, where with the Kryptonite product you're stuck with the combination from the factory."
2,Hussam Alhuzaimi,"This review is posted after a year of using this product.First of all it is an Extremely expensive set as i bought the whole set for around 900 US $ and i have been owning it almost a year ,when i first brought home it was the best cover set i ever experienced soft fine details gorgeous looking but after the 1st dry clean the colors started to merge and some silk ending got off and started to wear as if it has been cleaned hundreds of times .However, i went exactly through the clean instruction dry clean good temperature but the problem is the cover materials are so fragile ."
3,Devotional is Dry,"This book is designed to be used once a week. The idea is good--quote the Church Fathers on given subjects--however, the choices are not all that interesting--and lean toward the deep theological.I was also surprised at the brevity of this book. Each review (of 52) is only about a page and a half."
4,A perfect gift for all occasions,"When I first heard this CD on My Space the compassion and purity overwhelmed me. Who would have thought that I would meet the artist weeks later at a Grammy event and have the opportunity to share my thoughts with her in person. You and all your friends will thoroughly enjoy this retrospective of ""good music."" And if you get a chance to see Lynn perform live (for instance, Smooth Jazz Cruise 2009) I guarantee that you will have a wonderful time."
1,Junk,"This is the worst DVD ever. It's not restored. The ""Spooking About Africa"" is the worst print I've ever seen on a public domain tape or DVD. I have a high tolerance for scratches and such since I've watched PD tapes all my life, but this is a joke.They added sound effects into these shorts and it totally didn't work. It sounds like it was done in my basement. They ruined some of the best cartoons of all time by releasing this sack of feces.I'm a serious classic animation fan. The reviewer there with kids obviously has never watched the cartoons in their original format or has paid no attention to them since he or she saw them as a child. The children don't know the difference. The other reviewer, well, I just don't know..."
4,"Excellent, Reliable and good value","What else can I say, but that for the money this unit has been very good and reliable?"
3,Xact satellite radio,"Nice radio, it works well in our vehicle. I am not happy at all with the remote. You have to hold it right in front of the radio.....what's the point of having the remote?"
3,"cheap, good to try sirius, fm xmitter does not work in any metro area","works very well when directly connected to an amplifier, I own two. one for the car and one for the house. the single line display is functional. quality is like AM when using the FM transmitter. more display lines would be nice but it does work. remote control is OK, needs clear sight of the sensor. cable routing is awkward in the car and the house."
2,Not XACTly great.,I purchased this receiver to use exclusively in my car so I would not have to keep rotating my Sportster unit from the home docking station to my car several times a day. I have been frustrated in the reception with the XACT unit. The signal is not as strong and when I pass a driver with a satelitte radio their signal overpowers mine. These our problems I never had with the Sportster. Considering I'm paying for a 2nd subscription to use this unit it is disappointing that I am not able to enjoy it fully.
5,Simple and unobtrusive,"I got one of these little wonders to put in the car, and it does what it's supposed to do: Bring the best radio on radio into my car! I've noticed very few dropouts with this, unless you're parked under a bridge or something like that, you should get a strong signal.I do, however, highly recommend that you use the audio out to a line in on your car stereo, it's much better quality and the volume is much higher than using the FM transmitter, but if that's the only way you can connect, it works well enough :)I don't listen to terrestrial radio any more thanks to this!"
1,Dishonest company,It's impossible to speak to a person if you call customer service. The only human contact is an unresponsive e-mail address and it's clear this company simply does not ever honor their warranty.
1,Xact NOT consumer friendly,"I bought this Xact radio receiver. It continually locks up. I have been trying to get in touch with Xact for over a week. The phone numbers I find give a recording to send an email to them. The emails are returned ""undeliverable"". I will NEVER again buy products from Xact."
3,FM transmiter problem,"I own another one of these radios that I bought in 2006. It's great for the home. The old radio bradcasts it's signal to any radio in the entire house that's tuned to the selected fm station. The new model has trouble broadcasting to a radio that's only a foot away! So you need to do a direct connect to jacks on the back of your radio. That means you must buy multiple radios for every room in the house, or pricey signal distribution units. Apparentley, there were complaints that the signnal was too strong and interfered with other radios, so they dropped the signal strength. This seems to now be a problem with all brands of satalite radios."
4,It meets my requirements,"It is satisfactory. I initially used it in car. However, it only let me set to one station that i could use on radio in vehicle. My solution was to set up radio in the house. It meets my expectations."
3,decent revenge tale,"A father finds out who killed his daughter.The DVD itself says the title translates to ""Deadly Coke,"" not ""D*mn Coke."" I don't know how audiences in our country got the raunchier title.The end is not very suspenseful. The casting director should be reprimanded because too many of the characters looked alike. I had to listen carefully to names just to differentiate between individuals.This work is far from perfect. However, it was interesting enough. It's not a waste of your time. It's a bit predictable. Still, there are scenes and events along the way that kept my attention."
2,"so so, expected better!:(","this is a good dvd, although if you are going to buy a dvd of elvis buy Elvis king of entertainment. it has just about the same material except with better quality, if you are collecting it is worth while, if not I suggest Elvis King of Entertainment,"
1,don't buy it.,"This is just exerpts from longer versions of scenes that are in the better documentaries. I fast forwarded through it, realizing I had already seen it all, and then tossed it. Not rare at all."
4,Great Footage @ A Cheap Price!,"I found this enjoyable even though all the footage is pretty raw. It's like an amateur VHS compilationof the best Elvis appearances (no music performances). It's great how it all chronological - beginning to the end.It's worth watching and keeping.I watched this DVD and Elvis on Tour the same night for the first time and enjoyed this better, really.Snag your 1 cent DVD today!"
1,I'd rate it a minus if I could,"This was a fantastic scanner, but after 13 mos - i month out of warranty the lamp went out. Microtek has I understand taken everything off shore - to China no doubt, and they do not repair or have a way to buy parts for this piece. Wish I had waited a while to buy this piece so I would have seen some negative reviews. 1500.00 for a piece of equipment that only lasts 12 months is not - repeat - not a good investment for anyone. Now I am looking for a new scanner."
1,STILL NO DRIVER FOR VISTA,"We have this scanner at work. Unfortunately, it hasn't been used for the last couple months because there is still no driver for Windows Vista. They have been bumping back the expected release date for a driver for at least three months. If their developers are so slow, or they didn't have access to Vista (which has been available to retail since what January), they should at least put a realistic release date. This scanner is too expensive to have to wait indefinitely for what would seem to be baseline support."
1,"Lamps goes out, No Microtek repair service. AVOID!","The Microtek 9800XL gives OK scans at a large size. However, as many others note, very often the lamp will go out (I understand it's a hardware problem with the lamp driver board).Microtek will replace it if you are within the 1 yr. warranty. They will NOT repair it out of warranty. They will helpfully offer you a small discount on a new $1000 scanner.Let's recap that: I should buy from Microtek because their expensive scanner breaks just out of warranty and they offer no way to fix them. R-i-i-ght."
1,$1500 and completely worthless.,"I bought this large format scanner hoping it would speed up scanning and all it has done is take up my time. The interface is terrible, and Microtek is AWOL with customer relations. AVOID!"
2,Another voice added to the chorus of woe...,"I won't get into too much detail, but my experience with this unit is the same as reported by many others here. It worked like a champ for about a year. The color scans were faithful and vivid and the black and white were great. Then, I guess it's the lamp, the color scans began looking horrible. No fidelity to the source material. Watercolor, in particular, looked wretched. It still works, but only in grayscale and is slow as molasses. It's also noisy. I wouldn't buy another Microtek scanner. No way."
2,Scanning lamp went out,"I thought the scanner was great, but the lamp went out just after 1 year after I bought it. So now all my scans have a rainbow line from top to bottom. Microtek's extent of technical support is reinstall the drivers, if that doesn't work you have to return it so we can repair it, because there are no authorized repair people out there, but us. They will not sell me the lamp, because they need to repair it themselves (they want the labor dollars). So, after I paid $1,400 for this thing a year ago I am going to have to pay another $200-300 for repair and shipping both ways."
1,absolutely no support,"Scanner stopped working one week after warranty expired, which means this scanner only lasted one year. Microtek will not accept the scanner back for repair even at my cost and does not refer you to an authorized dealer for repair. The response is ""buy a new one."" The time frame for this response is two weeks. Please take the time to consider another brand!"
2,Nice - when it worked,"I've purchased two of these over the past year, and both of them had the lamp fail within the first 3 or 4 months of very light use. Sure, it's an inexpensive tabloid size scanner, but combine the quirky, buggy software with terrible technical support and a product that breaks after a short time of use and I wish I had bought something else. Even if it's double the cost."
4,In Defense of The Flower Kings!,"This may be as much a rant as a review......Are you people out of your mind? This is a treasure of a band.They have as much claim to the continued growth and resurgence of Progressive Rock as anyone.All I read is this could be better or that one doesn't hold my interest. I won't analyze or ""overanalyze"" the individual songs on this set. Suffice to say that there is plenty of great stuff here. For anyone new to this band, there is enough to pique your interest for further research into their massive output of work.I am aware that everyone is a critic these days, but give me a break! These guys make some incredible music and will continue to so. LONG LIVE THE FLOWER KINGS!!!!!!!"
5,Outstanding!,"I also have a Delta planer( with lost setting fixture for the blades) that desperately needed to have the blades changed. I got this product, and very quickly and reliably was able to reinstall a set of blades. It is very carefully designed to allow you to place new blades in the cutterhead ACCURATELY. I would highly recommend this product. The only misgiving I have about it is that one of the magnets came out of the fixture on first use, but I pressed it back into place and continued to do the blade installation."
4,only thing available,"Worked well, just needed a bit of patience to get blades set correctly. Original parts are no longer available and this was a a good replacement for the gauge."
2,"not that good, really","there some bands that somehow show up on everyone's radar all thanks to hype without having much substance behind what what they do. Pink Mountaintops is a prime example. This album isnt painful to listen to, but on the other hand it isn't really exciting or new either. They seem to sound like a B-rate Smog meets Velvet Underground tribute band at best. I gave it a few spins and it still bored me for the most part."
2,Big Disappointment,If you are looking for a cutesy book you won't be disappointed. If you are looking for information on identifying cattle of various breeds accurately - keep looking. This book has a cut out mask that you can hold in front of your face so you can moo at cows over the fence. There are no photographs of cows or anything else. Black and white sketches only. Buyer beware!!!
4,Cute book for learning the basics,"I bought this book because I've always had a ""thing"" for cows. My kitchen used to be decorated in cows. I'm one of those people that used to yell ""MOOOOO"" out of car windows, every time I would pass a field of cows.This book isn't exactly what I thought it would be, but I still recommend it. I was hoping for pictures, but there are only hand drawn illustrations. The illustrations are good...but I really wished for color photographs.There are fun facts on every page, which I enjoy being able to spout off. There are charts in the back of the book about milk production and beef production. My pre-teen daughter found enough information in this book to do a report on cows, even thought it's thin...she also found it to be a fast read.I'd recommend this book to someone curious about cows. It's a good starting-off point."
2,No Cow Photo,"The book had lots of good information, but only line drawings of the cows. I was disappointed in not having color photos since this was an identification book."
3,Ok...,"I have cows and live on a farm that was once a dairy farm. I purchased this book because I thought it might have some good pictures and information. I was 50% right. The information is very good. Each specific breed has it's own two pages to strut it's stuff. On the bottom of the page there is extra ""did you know..."" information. That is all really helpful. But the pictures. The pictures are all black and white. Even though it tells you what color the cow is, there should really be at least a couple real photographs. Other than the pictures, this is a really good book! Go for it!!"
1,A Field Guide to Cows:,"I was hoping it would show colored pictures of the different breeds of cows. The inside, unlike the cover, was not in color and showed parts of the cow more than breeds. Guessed wrong on what I wanted to buy.My husband and I really like Amazon though."
4,"Lighthearted, Cowgazing fun.","A nice little book for those of us city dwellers who admire cows, but know little about them. A nice place to begin. One of the most pleasant afternoons I spent recently was sitting with a herd of cows listening to them as they cropped the grass--very soothing and relaxing. Call me crazy...."
4,So cows are interesting. Who knew?,"I had no idea there were so many kinds of cow, or that cows could be so interesting. The author provides short but detailed summaries of 52 breeds, including a physical description, a drawing of both cow and bull, a description of their usefulness and a history of the breed. Peppered throughout are some very funny cartoon illustrations as well as random cow trivia -- for instance, Brahman cows do not moo but grunt. I think 9-to-12s with an interest in animals would like this as well as adults; there's plenty to go around. I added the author'sA Field Guide to Pigsto my to-read list, in hopes that it will be as good as this one was."
4,Entertaining but ...,I bought this book shortly after it was published and thought it was both informative and entertaining. The only complaint that I had was that it was illustrated with sketches instead of photographs. It's not like there are no cows around to pose for portraits.Since then similar books with photographs have become available.Beautiful CowsandThe Field Guide to Cattlehave much better illustrations. The text in A Field Guide to Cows is still a good size to carry in the car and is more amusing.
3,Not much improvement over GeForce 5200,"I thought the larger 256MB RAM would provide some significant improvement in this video card over my existing 3 year old NVIDIA GeForce 5200. No such luck. It seems about the same except this does support OpenGL 2.0, which I needed for Adobe After Effects.The 63 page Installation Guide (7 pages English) actually wasn't too helpful although it really wasn't needed for Windows XP. Just slip in the CD after having installed the new card and Windows Hardware Wizard installs the drivers automatically.This uses the old AGP graphics slot. Newer cards use PCI Express."
2,Difficult to follow,"If this is your first time with Photoshop, steer clear of this book. The examples are hard to follow and the illistrations do not help much either. I like his opinions, it just needs proofed a couple more times."
4,Is NO ONE safe from BIG BAD BUNNY?,"I laughed so hard I nearly cried at the wonderful pictures of BIG BAD BUNNY with his root'n toot'n shoot'n gem-studded carrot holster, his sombrero and bandana, and the fear he inspires in his neighbors. Thank goodness for WISE OLD BUNNY who saves the day!!!!"
4,hmm,"I have Get Real, another HF CD, and it's different than this CD. It's better. If you're going to get a Halo Friendlies CD, get Get Real, it's really good."
1,Here's why they never made it...,"Just listen to this second release by DEATHROW and you'll agree with me as to why these guys never made it big. Sure, they have a loyal following within their own country, but what band doesn't? They have sorry vocals, no catchy riffs and just a boring sound. Along with DESTRUCTION, they just missed the boat. Should have followed KREATOR or SODOM. Pass on this one..."
5,Page turner,Dr. Bill Burgett finishes up what he started in his first book with a great ending. When I finished Project 314 I wondered why there wasn't more. Great read!
1,Gross misrepresentation -- this is not a music CD,"I was extremely upset to find that this CD has absolutely music. No, the description does not explicitly say ""no music is on this CD,"" but the packaging includes ""tracks"" that are names of actual songs. Make no mistake: this is being fraudulently packaged and sold as a music CD.It does say ""audio CD book,"" but I've never encountered a product like this, so I truly believe that others will think they're buying music. Use this review as a cautionary tale.I thought I was getting a rare import containing some of MJB's largely unheard tracks, and I assumed the name of the CD (""unauthorized biography ..."") was just a concept-type approach (a la ""miseducation of lauryn hill"").I'm keeping it since I already opened it.And yes, I love mary, so it's not a total waste of time. but, the sellers who got me for $10+ sure are."
1,Unauthorized Bio- SUCKS!,"I also purchased this-- and thought it was a CD with Music. Oh well, As far as content there is some wrong information about Mary on the cd but what are you going to do! I Would not recommend this CD to anyone!!! Dont waste your time or money!!"
1,bad experience with Amazon,I ordered the unit on June 22 and still has not received it. Today is Sunday June 29th. According to e-mail received from Amazon it was due in Lake Geneva on June 27th. The tracking information informs me that the order was shipped and on its way.??? Totally unacceptable from a company like Amazon. Never ever again.BA
3,Got it via 4 years ago?,"I believe i got this 4 years ago when everything was pretty much awesome! As i can recall, I was in the 5'th grade. As you can see, my sister bought it for me for my 5'th grade graduation! I personally think she just wanted it but i really didn't like this game alot.. Only my siblings. Therefore, i like how she might have thought of getting me something she'd like alot but it's not really my kind of game."
4,A Modern Day Romance,"I was initially very sceptical about reading a book based upon an established classic - I tend to avoid any type of re-writes, ""based-upons"" or sequels written by other than the original authors. However, I was delightfully surprised with ""Pride, Prejudice and Jasmin Field"". It was a little slow-going at first but I soon began to enjoy the paralleling stories of the real characters vs. the characters they were playing in a stage production of the original Jane Austen classic. Some people may find it somehow intellectually offensive for a writer to use such a format but I honestly found it to be a very entertaining and heart-warming read. The book has even prompted me to re-read the original, it having been close to 30 years since I have done so."
4,Ingenious and Fun,"It's hard to imagine a finer modernization of JA's P&P than this, with the exception of some under-developed plot lines, and a few poor choices of crude or vulgar language. The weaker plot lines are minor, such as the parallel to Lydia's being ruined, which I won't go into so I don't spoil the book for anyone. However, if you're familiar with Austen's novel, you will recognize what's coming in this one, but it's still a lot of fun. (You don't get the same degree or sense of social scandal to the family, as with Lydia and the Bennets, but perhaps that's why this book is more light-hearted and easy reading.) The bad language (occasional) also ""jarred"" with the atmosphere of what the author was trying to do, I think., and made it somewhat less enjoyable, but there isn't a great deal of it, thankfully. I opened it just to get a sense of the tone, and I ended up having to finish it. Dinner was late for the family! I'll probably want to read this one again sometime, too."
4,Great Update of P&P,"Melissa Nathan's update of P&P is fun to read. I loved Jasmin Field's spirit, one very much like Elizabeth Bennet's. There were parts, admittedly, which were ""stretched"" to fit the many twists and turns of P & P. Yet, Ms. Nathan achieves this in a very witty novel. Her explanation of how Darcy is feeling when he dances with Elizabeth is one of the best I have ever read. She truly captures the pain Darcy experiences during this time in the original novel. Having Jasmin and Harry act out the part and explain what they hoped to achieve in the scene was like reading an annotated version of the original. See pp. 145-146 to see what I mean. Also, some of the underlying ""feminism"" concepts are addressed. On page 52 when Jasmin reiterates what it means to be a woman in the modern world, I could hear Elizabeth Bennet checking off her list in Regency England. You will enjoy this adaptation."
3,Better than most P&P homages,"Another update of Austen's immortal Pride and Prejudice. This one finds London magazine writer Jasmin Field cast as Elizabeth Bennett in a charity performance of the book to be directed by a big movie star. Of course, Jasmin and the star re-enact the original story in their personal lives as they recreate the novel onstage. This Austen homage is nowhere near as good as Bridget Jones but better than most of the P&P redos that have followed."
1,I never thought it could be this bad,"I'm sitting here trying to think of something good about this book, and I'm still at a loss. From exposition to end, the characterization is consitpated and the plot lines flabby. I love Jane Austen's book and most adaptations of it, but this book is not worthy of the title that it takes."
3,"slow start, but escapist read","Although I enjoyed reading this novel, I think that I've read one too many ""P&P"" remakes. I knew the plot of the book because I was already such a huge fan of the original and of Bridget Jones. I did like the fact that Jazz wasn't a big pushover, and that she had confidence in herself, her body, and her life. It's nice that the female lead wasn't all weepy about not getting a man for once.All in all, a quick and enjoyable read, although it's a little slow in the beginning and predictable by the end."
4,I wish I'd thought of this,"I'll start off by saying that Pride and Prejudice is probably my favorite book ever. There. I said it. That's probably why this book gets brownie points to begin with. There wasn't a tiny piece of Austen's plot that wasn't carefully moulded into the modern day story of P. P. and J. F. For her considerate conservation, I applaud her, and it provided for a very fun reading. However, I found that the humor was a bit forced, and, well, not funny. Perhaps it is just my own sense of humor, but what can I say. I have only read one other modern-day Austen adaption, Briget Jones' Diary. I found this one much more funny, although less true to the plot (which I think was intentional) and I enjoyed it thoroughly. B. J. D. was a more universal book, but J. F. was good, and I would reccomend it to anyone who loves the original as much as I do."
5,"Sweet, and would make a first rate movie","I'd say that definitely, I would much rather end up with Harry Noble than Austen's Mr. Darcy. Nathan writes with spunk and although her prose style is a little unsure in spots, the general tone is even and pleasant. The updating of Austen's novel in this style is pure genius. It was an enjoyable read and I've recommended it to many of my friends. If they can't sit through Austen's 2 centuries olf tome, I recommend this to give tham an idea of what they're missing. Even if they don't read Pride and Prejudice, they at least see the Colin Firth movie"
2,Disappointing - stay with Jane A.,"Jane's P&P is probably my favorite novel, so I was excited to read an update, but this re-telling just doesn't hold up. The plot is far-fetched at best (Honestly, a one-night stage production of P&P directed by Britain's leading heart-throb and cast with amateur actors?? Please.) and the attempts to create parallels to all of the characters and situations in the orignal were just clumsy and transparent. Completely unbelievable. Had a hard time reading as I neared the end because I had rolled my eyes so often I couldn't focus any more."
3,only for passionate jane austen fans,"Well, I don't really like to give books reviews that don't have at least 4 stars, you know that old saying from our moms, if you don't have anything nice to say, say nothing at all. But, I felt compelled.I read the whole book only for one reason, and that was the ""device"" the author used to tell her story. I am a passionate fan of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, so the parallels with that book kept me reading this book. However, if you are not a fan, I can't think of any reason to read this book. I never felt conncected with anyone, and can't say I even liked anyone very much. I had a few chuckles over her character comparisons with the origionals of Ms. Austen's, but otherwise, not much there."
4,"A Quick, Delightful Read","It took me one day to read this funny novel. Not only are the situations and characters funny, but my love for Austen's Pride and Prejudice caused me to eagerly anticipate the outcome I knew would happen, and laugh as Jasmin, Harry, and the rest managed to follow Austen's dance nearly two hundred years later. This book mixed modern day humour with the Austen love story wonderfully. The pace was fast, and although Jasmin is not Eliza Bennet, the book was a great way to spend my last weekend before classes begin."
2,Pride and Prejudice? How about Boring and Unoriginal?,"I am also a huge Jane Austen fan, and have read P&P quite a few times. After reading this re-do, all I can say is why bother? There was not an original move in the book not lifted directly from the original, other than the extraordinary bitchiness of the title character. If I wanted the EXACT same story, with the EXACT same characters and devices, I could have just re-read Pride and Prejudice. I'm all for updates, but mirror images? Don't bother!"
1,Enough already,"The knock-off Pride and Prejudice retelling was done well enough in Bridget Jones's Diary. Let's leave well enough alone, shall we? I don't know why Melissa Nathan decided that Jane Austen needed her help because this story's been done.It's utterly predictable and not that compelling. If you're looking for a silly book on a rainy day, this is an easy read. But it offers nothing new to either Austen's work or the first modern retelling a la Helen Fielding."
2,Too Close For Comfort,"I started this book eagerly, because Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is a favorite book. However, I felt the author made the parallels to P&P too close to be believable. After all, the characters were supposed to be rehearsing a P&P play throughout the book. I kept waiting for one of them to say. ""Wait a minute. What's going on here? We're all pairing up in couples just like the book."" A better take-off on Pride and Prejudice is Kate Fenton's Lions and Liquorice, published about five years ago."
3,too much of the form and too little of the spirit,"In general I love re-tellings of classic stories. Since I am very fond of Pride and Prejudice, I thought I would really enjoy this book. And I did enjoy it--up to a point. The problem with the book for me is that somewhere in the middle of the book I began to get the feeling that PP&JF is less of a retelling and more of a too painfully literal temporal translation of Austen's tale. There is too little of the individuality and freshness and _tweaking_ that make re-tellings enjoyable. Part of the problem may be that the original P&P is very much an integral part of PP&JF's plot--the backdrop of PP&JF is the staging of an amateur P&P play. The constant parallel between the play-within-a-book and the plot of the book just became too cutesy and self-conscious after a while."
1,Disconcertingly bad.,"Character development? Zilch.Really, the only dimension any of these characters has is given by their correspondence to the characters in the original books. Nathan leaves so many plot points and character interactions at loose ends, it becomes terribly important to reference Austen's work just to figure out why each character archetype behaves as they do.Believable character interactions and reactions? Maybe.....no, zilch.If nothing else, does she honestly think there are men....or even people....who behave this way? Perhaps if she had actually developed the story rather than just making sure to hit all the major plot points.My utter displeasure with this book has rendered me incoherent.Ugh."
1,"ouch, ouch, ouch","A few of the other reviews say ""I never read the original P &P..."". Egad, if you've never read the original, do yourself a favour and begin it immediately! Don't waste your time with this inane drivel. I know this is Ms Nathan's first book, but I wonder how she got a book deal with this idea. What was the pitch? ""I'll write a book and base it on a classic. No wait, I'll just copy (in some places word for word) the classic in plot and characters, thereby saving myself from having to come up with anything original."" Poke my eye, this was horrid stuff.Now, I myself like a good romance to read while soaking in the tub, but a good romance doesn't have to mean predictable to the point of boredom (I mean really, if you know who every character is immediately and exactly who they are going to end up with, and exactly how they will get there, and exactly what they'll say while they're on their way...).Ack, Ack, Ack, big ol' hairball."
1,You get what you pay for,"It's hard to go wrong with drills, but these guys managed to do it.Smaller drill sizes (in the top row) were mostly broken by the time I first opened the box.Many of the drills had come out of their places during shipping, so I started putting them back in the correct holes for their size. It was then that I noticed that some of the drill sizes were duplicated. For example, the 3/8 size and the next size down from that each had a 3/8 drill - instead of there being two different sizes. It's like the packager just had a bucket of drills and was just putting them in whichever hole was close to the drill size.There were 115 drills as advertised - but what I wanted were 115 different sizes, whereas I got about 98 different sizes."
1,You get what you pay for.,"When I recieved the 115 piece set, a lot of the drill bits were out of their slots. I broke 1 drill bit trying to untangle the mess. I have already broken 6 of the drill bits in less than 3 months. The bits are not very sharp. If you are looking for a good drill bit set, DO NOT buy this one!"
3,Good Low-Priced Set,"I bought this set so I would always have the right size drill at home. I am allowed to use a nearby machine shop when I need to do more involved work.The drill bits are OK if you have a dril-bit sharperner or if you are proficient at sharpening bits with a bench grinder. They don't come super-sharp when you get them and they work much better after sharpening.When I received my brand-new set the case was broken. One of the rivets had missed, and so one side of one of the trays was not attached. I could have fixed it, but instead I bought individual cases for each of the drill ranges.If I had it to do over, I would have bought a higher-quality set with separate cases for the numbered, fractional and lettered sizes."
4,Entertaining and largely persuasive big picture archeology,"Lekson, an expert on Southwestern archaeology, presents a provocative thesis about the civilization that produced the great houses in New Mexico's Chaco Canyon. He proposes that Chaco Canyon was one of three successive capitals of a politically integrated region. According to Lekson, a ruling elite emerged at Chaco and perpetuated itself by moving a ceremonial city along Chaco's meridian. Lekson writes in an engaging and often deliberately provocative style. This is as fun as serious archaeology gets, though Lekson sometimes repeats his points. The book is well illustrated with diagrams and black and white photographs."
3,Kinda good,"This book, for me, is a combination of what makes the Simpsons great, and the bad that we don't see too much on TV. The book begins with ""Be-Bop-A-Lisa"" in which Lisa joins a band with Otto. This is one of the better ones in the collection. Next, a short called ""The End Of El Barto"" is a clever little police drama that is very funny. Unfortunately, the funniest thing about ""The Greatest D'oh On Earth"" is the title. Homer is annoyingly meaner than usual, and the plot goes nowhere. McBain next is okay. Then, ""I Shrink, Therefore I'm Small"" is an atrocity. I can't find one funny thing about this. Same goes for the next short. Finally, ""The Purple Prose Of Springfield"" is the best of the book. A Barney short at the end is good too."
2,"It's Simpsons, but not as good as the TV show.","This book is good, but it is not nearly as good as the full experience of the Simpsons that you get from the TV show. I read it once and kinda threw it in the corner and forgot about it. This is despite the fact that I am a Simpsons fanatic. I found I missed the voices from the show immensely. You lose an awful lot of the hidden jokes from the show and the humor just isn't there. Bottom line: If you absolutely can not pass this book up, buy it. Otherwise, find some other way to blow a couple bucks."
4,Simply Wonderful...,"This album is filled with industrial and electro beats. Very danceable and even though its all in German, Das Ich sounds great! There are also remixes by vnv nation , and one, and funker vogt. Enjoy!"
1,Sarah Jordan Powell,"At the time Ms. Powell recorded the selections, her voice was second to none anywhere - America or anyplace on the globe. The timbre of her voice is unsurpassed. However, she yells a lot and for crowd-pleasing, she repeats phrases a lot. That takes away from her God-given gift that certainly needs no embellishment."
4,Dead Man's Curse: A Blessing for Many.,"For long-time listeners of Techno Animal who have had to search the globe for that rare, out of print single, a release on Matador is truly a blessing. ""Dead Man's Curse"" finds the animal on familiar ground with their heavy (pounding!) beats and wall of noise electronics. Yet they take a step forward with this release (and the previously released ""Megaton"") by adding vocals to their dark-hop style. Far from rap, the vocals on the title track resemble a spoken word piece, delivered with the angst and intensity necessary to accompany a JK-Flesh/Bug production. The second track, ""City of Glass,"" actually steals the show with its amazing dub and trippy electronics. My only complaint, albeit a small one (which prevents this release receiving 5 stars) is that the title track sounds waaaaay too much like ""Megaton."""
5,Acurately titled book - and a gift from Mr. Rohn,Mr. Jim Rohn takes us on a Journey that guides and directs us to embrace what it means to have purpose. Then what it means to live according to those principles. May your words Mr. Rohn help us all to become what God had intended. Thank you for your nuggets of wisdom over the years you were with us.
4,Good game,"It's a very good game for starters. Finish this game, get all the achivements and you'll be a very happy player!!"
2,not articularly good in any respect,"This is not an enjoyable game. It rarely rises to the level of ""fun"".The movement and cover system is similar to Gears of War, but I'd say it doesn't work as well in Dark Sector as it does in GoW.There isn't much of a story.Your main weapon is a ""glaive"", which is thrown and sometimes guided. Many tasks are impossible without learning to control the glaive. I used the glaive almost exclusively and never came to appreciate it, especially when you have to guide it. Towards the end, I can't even explain how tired and bored I was of using the thing.The boss fights have a similar feel to GoW in that some are almost trivial once you look up what to do. The final boss fight is as worthless and annoying as any I can think of."
4,Dark Sector reallly worth playing,"Dark sector is a very good action horror survival , it's not resident evil but is really worthy to be played. The story mode is pretty good , gory and violent everything u want in a videogame but this is not a game to have a good online multiplayer experience . I give it 8.5 out of 10."
4,Choppy Choppy,"Well... at first I was not so convinced of getting this game because I really don't like dark games.. and of course, this game is called ""Dark Sector""... but, what the hell, lets give it a try... I got the game on and first one... it's in black and white?!?!?!?!?! that really bummed me down, but after the short introduction level... the fun began... I haven't finished the game yet, but let me tell ya IT's SOOO FRIGGIN FUN just to see the chopping thingy fly away and just... Chop.. jejejee.It's a cool and beautifully presented game (nice graphycs)... so if your not into all the dark stuff and all that... rent it, give it a try.. and I bet you'll end buying this game... Peace Out"
1,Dark Sector is Too DARK to see,"This games graphics are too dark. I tried lightening the gamma but I still can't see anything. Oh, the original description of this game said that a free 3 month subscription to XBox LIVE would be included. No card came with it."
1,A Good Review,"I got the game very quickly and am really pleased with the shipper. I'm not a big fan of the game, but that is not the shipper's fault."
4,Suprise for a bargin price game,Got this game to fill in some time before the next major title came out. WOW! Impressed for the price. Enjoyed the game play and would recommend to others. Very good shooter.....
2,"Short, fun, no replay value","Dark Sector's mediocre graphics and paltry story can be overlooked for its concise, linear gameplay, and engaging combat. While the game can be completed in under 8 hours, you'll find yourself eagerly awaiting each new ability, and enjoying using those abilities in combat.There is little to no replay value in this game however, so it's a good thing that the price point has fallen so low.Definitely worth one play-through though, in my opinion."
3,Great game for the price.,I would recommend this game because it has great game play and also it was pretty cheap. I went and downloaded the demo off the net before I bought the game. I really like the glaive. Give it a try you'll like it.
4,Dark Sector,This is a cool game for the price it is just about what I expected. I like the game and the way it plays. All this information is from my son as I have not played the game my self.
3,Very good for the money,"I bought this back a few years ago and it held most of my tools almost perfectly. I tried to load all of my tools and the zipper teeth went south on me and I am now shopping for a new one. The outside pockets were of dubious worth as my smaller componants would fall out of them. The blind reach test was also tricky, if you didn't have room to fold out the flaps and were in an enclosed space, the value was mitigated quite a bit. I would recommed this pouch for those who have less than 20 pounds of tool and room to lay it out"
3,Tool Bag,The back is made of great material. My only complaint is that a lot of the slots were too small. I didn't really like the organization of the bag. Ended up not using it at all.
5,LOVE THIS BAG,I love this bag and all Custom Leathercraft products in general. It completely got rid of the need for me to carry around a big tool box. Now you can strap it all on your back in a stylish fashion. Great amount of pockets varying in size and the quality of the bag overall is something that you wont find with any other tool backpack
3,A unique presentation,"I read this book in an effort to better understand the civilian nuclear industry (which I have worked in since 1986). Having held various technical and management positions in the US Navy nuclear program and civilian nuclear industry, my experience is broad enough to conclude that Constance Perin has done her homework. She brings a cultural anthropologist's view to the management of risk at nuclear power stations, which are often run by and for technocrats, so her perspective is refreshing. She takes a balanced approach and appears to have no personal agenda regarding nuclear power. Much of what she says rings true, although I found her writing style to be stilted and distracting. I do not recommend SHOULDERING RISKS for anyone looking for a casual read, but it is worth the effort for those seeking to learn more about humans perceive and manage risks in complex, high-stakes environments."
2,Anthropological culture is not organizational culture,"I am a nuclear power industry safety culture subject matter expert. I had a couple of personal conversations with the author. Safety culture is part of organizational culture, which is properly studied under the management sciences, not the humanities, not the natural sciences. The significant culture at a nuclear power plant [and in the nuclear Industry] is ""safety culture"" which is part of [a subset of] the organizational culture. Anthropological culture is not organizational culture. A few interesting interviews and observations, maybe 30% are good observations, 70% are misguided. For much of the book it is apparent [to me] that the author is out of her depth. Very nice British lady however."
3,"It was fine, but not a 'Wow!'",I was really looking for one photograph which was in the book and it was! That in itself was worth it.
2,Looks like a Cracker Jack ring,This ring only works if you want a cheap looking piece. The silver is high enough quality that it didn't turn my finger green but the stones are visibly fake. The baguettes are especially horrid and the *emerald* cut is really a radiant cut. The only good thing is the company's fast shipping. It actually got here 2 days after I ordered it. *You get what you pay for* definitely applies here.
1,lousy,"I ordered this ring when my real engagement ring was being sized so I wouldn't have to deal with questions from nosy coworkers. As another reviewer pointed out, the stone is not emerald cut ... which didn't really matter because it fell out of the setting about 3 days after I got it."
2,Gives me a headache!,"I feel terrible, I got this as a gift for my uncle for Christmas, and I asked later if he ever uses it, and the response was a big fat NO. I tried it out when he opened it up for Christmas and much to my dismay, the ""massage"" turned out to be a really annoying vibration, and it really isn't that cool to have the audio-sync stuff. It's kinda dumb. The only thing it's good for I guess is just using it as a chair cushion and plugging in your iPod so you can have speakers by your ear ... luckily you can choose to turn the audio-sync off.I give it one extra star because the product works fine, I was just expecting something more."
1,careful when you buy this.. ID or OD not spec,"Be careful that this hose is really what you want. When I bought this item it's not spec'ed whether this is 2"" ID or 2""OD.... I just assumed it would work with other vacuum system flanges I bought here. Not true! Didn't work for me with the 2"" vacuum system flanges I purchased here -- maybe there are other types that it works with???"
5,alison elliotts best,"alison elliott is at her best as percy talbot in the spitfire grill.it is a great movie about a girl that has spent the last five years in prison.she cames to a small town in maine to start fresh.newengland scenery and themes of forgiveness,healing and caring coalesce into a movie that will touch the heart.if yo buy this movie you will not regret it."
4,Don't miss this one!!!,"Extraordinary film, full of grace and compassion. Beautifully filmed with solid performances, Alison Elliott is a stand-out!"
3,REALLY didn't like ending/otherwise film is nice,"I REALLY REALLY REALLY didn't like the ending of this. I think that's why the movie bombed at the box office. Up till then the film is quite nice. The performances & directing are excellent. Can't say why I didn't like ending without giving it away, except to say that the line ""redemption is served at the Spitfire Grill"" (the last line of copy on the rear of the box) is quite inaccurate."
1,Broken,Tape end that goes into the machine was broken. Went ahead and played it ...Was able to watch one time but had to pull out with needlenose plyers to get released from area. Not happy.
4,The Three Stooges - The Outlaws Is Coming,As advertised. Fast delivery and mailed to an APO box. Great Amazon seller
5,Longest title you'll ever see!,"What a great book!At first it looks pretty serious and unapproachable, but here is what I recommend. Start on page 149, the Background chapter. Then read the texts, the words of Nagarjuna, starting on page 7. You'll be surprised how much is approachable without a knowledge of Sanskrit, Tibetan, and Buddhist philosophy.As the Dalai Lama's translator says on theback cover, ""A remarkable example of what a combination of Sanskrit and Tibetan scholarship can do to illuminate the meaning of ancient Buddhist texts.""Everyone is reading Jamieson's Perfection of Wisdom, but actually this Nagarjuna book has a lot more to it, greater depth, less glossy. And it is guaranteed to be the book with the longest title on your shelves! :-) On the BBC interview this book was not even mentioned. It may not be as trendy and fashionable in London literary circles, but it is my preferred Jamieson book."
2,Mole Extricated,"Progressive rock has always had this one element that seemed to be in opposition to the melodic, flowing, uplifting music of Yes, Camel, Focus, to name a few. This congenital growth out of prog was unusually dark, with angular movements and usually dissonant without melody or form. This style, probably more jazz-like than progressive, was interesting at times, but on this release, it is not. Harsh feedback, abrasive, incoherent ranting, uninteresting time changes, this is for the stout,so-called, ""intellectual"", Rock-In-Opposition (RIO) crowd, and Soft Machine fans, I guess. I didn't find much of anything of interest on this album. Glad this Mole was short lived."
2,Barely useful!,"This book has barely more information than the online manuals provided with SQL Server 2000. There's lots of topics, but not covered in depth-- just like the online manuals. There's a big picture on almost every page, and the book is written verbosely. Less than half of the book is actually useful. The other half is filled with useless adjectives (like 'actually' in the previous sentence) and pointless analogies or anecdotes. Phewww! What stinks? This book!"
4,Gripping,"Relics is only the second book I have read by Shaun Hutson - the first being Compulsion - so I cannot compare it to his other books, but I thought that it was very good. Relics is genuinely scary in places and features truely nasty death scenes.After a team of archaeologists uncover an ancient underground sacrificial chamber filled with childrens skulls, the novel turns into a combination of supernatural slasher (with a body coutn well into the double figures - there's a very bloody death every 30 pages or so!) and mystery whodunnit as archaeologist Kim, along with a police officer, try to figure out who is commiting the grotesque murders, and what connection it has to the Druid relics found in the underground chamber.Very compulsive reading, I read the second half of the book in one go because I just couldn't put it down."
4,Great taste but costly,This is the best tasting green tea I have had. I gave it only 4 stars because it is so expensive.
5,Tasty!,"I actually bought this at a Whole Foods at $6 for a tin (22 bags), which is a good price when you compare it to the other tins of tea bags on the shelf. I brewed this in almost-boiling water for 4 mins. The thinnish tea bags are nice cause you don't have to squeeze them out so much when they're done.The taste is really nice - probably sounds odd but it reminds me of Fruity Pebbles :) You don't get a lot of the green tea taste. The lemon is the strongest flavor but it's not tart, it's mellowed out by the jasmine. I usually don't add anything to green tea but you could probably get away with some sweetener in this.I'll probably buy this again, and hey, maybe someday I'll be motivated to buy a whole 6-pack of tins from Amazon!"
2,One of the weakest corgi books out there,"The New Complete Pembroke Welsh Corgi by the same author (D. Harper) is vastly superior to this book. That book contains information about corgis & no other breed. Half of the information in this book is on corgis, but the rest of this book contains generic information that pertains to all breeds. For example; the ""Happy Healthy Pet"" book for westies shares some identical chapters with this one."
1,A Disgrace to the Memory of Lonesome Dave,"This CD is a disgrace and a lame attempt to cash in on the success of Foghat Live, one of the great live rock and roll albums. For those who are not aware, there are virtually no original members left in this band. Leader/singer/songwriter Lonesome Dave has sadly passed on. Give it a rest, please. I would recommend the original Foghat Live wholeheartedly."
5,Yet Another Great Live Foghat CD,"LIVE II is yet another great live Foghat CD. While it's true to say that singer Dave Peverett and guitarist Rod Price can never truly be replaced, sole remaining original member Roger Earl gave it a good try by bringing in Charlie Huhn and Bryan Bassett, both of whom, like Earl, advocate sanctions against Indonesia in retaliation for that country's trumped-up 2005 drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist, as well as increased funding for law enforcement, making this CD an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience."
5,Great Album!! Real Fans Only Need Apply,"True, only one original member. But the band carries on with the memories of Dave, Rod & Tony firmly entrenched in their playing and attitude. This 2 cd set rocks as well as rolls start to finish. The band is tight as the original Foghat ever was. A band that marches on with the blessing of the great Lonesome Dave.The sound quality, mix and overall production is top rate. As a fan of the band well back into it's Savoy Brown days, I was pleasantly surprised and thrilled by this purchase. It has been in my car cd player for weeks now. The band seems to be having a sh%tload of fun and the audience can feel their energy. If you are a long time Foghat fan (like me), you know the songs, you know the history of the band, you know the legacy, but you don't know how good this album really is. Highly recommeded!"
5,Love this tea,I love the flavor of this tea plus it sooths the Lichen Planus I have in my mouth. I would highly recommend it.
5,YUMMY,"I love earl grey tea and this is a unique spin on it. The ""berry"" taste is very subtle so you can still taste the ""earl"". I like to drink this when I want to mix up my tea rotation."
5,Zhena's Gypsy Tea,"Zhena's Gypsy Tea, the Rasberry Earl flavor is fabulous. Fool Bodied and sweet to taste. I've tasted other flavors by Zhena's, butthis one is my fav. If you are a tea drinker, you owe it to yourself to enjoy some exotic tea's, this one is great. Several of myfriend's are very happy at Christmas time when I wrap a can of Zhena's tea for their gift. You can include a china cup, and othergoodie's if you care to, but the tea is terrific."
4,A different way of understanding masculinity,"I am only a lay person in exploring the ideas of Jungian psychology. However, my curiosity seems to know when it discovers a very interesting line of thought. This is what I found in this book. The idea of masculinity being underpinned by an archetype or god that is infused with the numinous was really the idea to which I kept returning. Here is an understanding that seems to emerge from some unknown but seductive antiquity. It's difficult to explain but I saw this sort of understanding as promising all sorts of possible insights some of which are developed in this book. I found it refreshing to stumble upon some reasoning that not only moves beyond the mechanical aspects of masculine sexuality but also promises further interpretation."
1,What a silly book.,"It's like a lot of Jungiana, a lot of assertions and vapid conclusions. What makes this one worse than most is the pretentiousness of its language and tone. I do not have the impression that the author really has enough depth in comparative religions, anthropology, or even psychology to pull this off, and too bad, because the subject has potential."
2,slow shutter!,"This is a camera with many nice features and one very poor feature: it won't take the picture when you push the shutter button. Instead it can hang fire a second or more, which means that if you're trying to catch a fleeting moment, that moment will have passed. There's no excuse for this, and I haven't been able to figure out any way to speed it up. Autofocus cameras always have a little delay, but this is ridiculous, and it suggests that Kodak is aiming for a pure ""snapshot"" photographer with low expectations. I'm keeping the camera for my kids to use but will be going to a Nikon or something similar for better performance."
3,easy to use,"Absolutely, under no circumstances, purchase this item from PC Nation. Their customer service is not their priority. The camera itself is easy to use and of good quality and found it to be worth the money."
4,kodak 4320 digital camera,"excellent camera all around, takes great pictures. only problem was with the green ready light next to viewing window. there's too much glare when trying to frame picture especially at night. it obsures your vision. also the kodak editing program has a lot of useful features such as removing red eye, cropping etc. but when you want to print photo's its set up to use kodak photo paper."
3,A little slow on the uptake,"This is a very nice camera, I thought the pictures were very clear. Of course the main convenience is deleting pictures that you don't want. A major problem I found with this camera is that it's not very fast, and therefore it makes catching spontaneous moments very difficult. For example, it is impossible to photograph my baby's cute but fleeting expressions because by the time the camera gets around to taking the shot, my son has moved on. Lacking experience with other digital cameras, I don't know if this long lag time between hitting the button and the shutter releasing is typical of all digital cameras or just this one.... Because of this flaw, I will be returning the camera hopefully to find a faster one!"
5,Awsome Camera!!!,This camera is awsome! We got a brand new computer and got this camera. I think it is great. We got the dock with it. I like the LCD on the back. After you put the camera on the dock you just push a button. Then you click Tranfer. Then you pictures are on the screen. I like the special effects of the software. Easy to use. Pictures turn out great!!! This is a great camera!!!!
1,Not worth buying,cons:Takes forerver to take the photo after you press the shutter.power guzzler. Nothing eats batteries like this.Doesn't save some of the settings after you turn off the device.Expensive when you consider the features it offers.pros:Good picture quality.One final note : It died after an years usage. Avoid this camera at all costs!. Too bad that I couldnt give it a zero star.
2,I am sure there are better cameras out in this $$ range,"I use this camera for work taking picture of damaged vehicles. For outside use in good light it works fine. However if you are in a parking garage taking a picture (poor lighting) you are out of luck unless you are ultra-close to your intended target. The flash is weak, I have not been able to take a good picture inside without good lighting. Also I can't stand the horrible delay in start up and shutter lag, this thing takes for ever to take a picture. I do have the docking station which is great for transfering pictures to your computer; however, it is unreliable for charging. You have to go through a ritual of turning the camera on and off (or opening the battery door) to get the docking station to make the proper connection and actually charge? My prior DC50 (early model digital) worked much better."
3,Docking Station Blues,"I received this camera for Christmas. The software loaded easily to both my Win2000 and WinXP computers so I have no idea why prior reviewers had problems. It takes decent pictures and is very easy to use. There is a delay when you click the button until the picture is taken... I miss a lot of spontaneous shots that way. My biggest beef is the battery charger. Mine did not come with a docking station and I was given a traveling battery charger. Much to my dismay, the lithium batteries that came with the camera do not fit the charger and the NiCad batteries that came with the charger last only a fraction of the time as the lithium. I found that the only way you can charge the lithium batteries is to buy the docking station ...! This inexpensive camera suddenly becomes very expensive."
2,Camera was good until the lens cover broke,I bought this camera in April 2003 and have taken alot of good pictures with it. I used the viewer mostly so I didn't have trouble with batteries.I would say it is a good camera but the switch that opens the lens cover stuck and we couldn't get it open. My husband took it apart and we find it has a delicate setup on the lens cover. PLASTIC!! The lens cover had broken inside.Replacement parts are not longer available.I think this camera should have lasted more than 3 years. I would have rated it a 5 star if it hadn't given me this problem.My sister bought a Canon at the same time and she still has a good camera.So I changed to Canon for my next camera which I just bought this month. Sept 2006.
2,Need more information to purchase item,It would be nice if prospective buyers could at least have the name of the songs on the CD. Please give us that much so we can try it or if we are looking for a certain song.
4,Great Product for touching up Black top driveway,"I chose 4 for the Red Devil Blacktop & Roof repair. Easy to use to fill in the tiny cracks in my driveway. One tube is not enough so I am ordering another tube. p.s. this product is hard to find in the DIY stores and this is why I bought it fm Amazon.com, where I buy most of my items that are hard to find and for the convenience."
5,great stuff,"This hose is great stuff, thick walled, plastic spiral means cuts easily but still holds shape, smooth internal wall. Fits all the 2.5"" ports that I have (Incra wonderfence, Rikon bandsaw, DW735 planer) as well as the dust collection fittings that woodcraft sells for 2.5"" hose.Look no further for quality, reasonably priced hose.Grizzly, as always, is a pleasure to deal with. Literally shipped overnight."
1,Poor Service,"I ordered this product and though my credit card was charged, I never received the merchandise. Weeks of calls and e-mails to J&D Fine Foods went unanswered. I finally had to seek resolution through Amazon who promptly intervened and my refund to my credit card was made."
4,Can't beat the price,Arrived in the mail right on time and works very well for price. This does not take away the need for proffessional sharpening of your knives of course but does help maintain them.
4,This for dressing your blades.,"If you have good access to your planer blades without having to remove them, and you understand the mechanics of sharpening blades, you will be able to dress your blades right in place with this inexpensive tool. If your blades are sharp, then this tool can keep them sharp with a little effort between uses. Don't wait until your blades are dull and chipped, as this tool isn't suited to rehab worn out blades.From my experience, dressing your planer blades between uses is the only way to go. For example, I have a grizzly 24"" planer that has very easy to access blades from the top. I dress the blades after every use in just a minutes with a diamond knife sharpener that I bought years ago. I have yet to replace these blades, and it has been several years. I'm using this Steelex sharpener on a small 12"" 2030S Makita planer/jointer that I own, and it dresses the blades to my satisfaction. I think there may be a diamond version of this sharpener, which would be even better."
4,Works about as well as expected,Was having trouble finding new blades for an older Delta planer. Figured I'd give this little tool a try and it seemed to put a better edge on the blades than how they were. Not at all like a good professional sharpening but I could see fresh steel on the bevel after use and the planer seemed to leave a better finish as well.I have since installed new blades and use the sharpener before each use.Worth the cheap price
1,Shapener is worthless,"This sharpener seemed like a good idea, but it is worthless. I have a Delta benchtop planer, and the knives had become dull. The sharpener did not sharpen the knives at all."
1,Piece of Junk,Immediately after getting the sharpener out of the packaging it came out of my hands and fell on the floor. The sharpening stone (if could actually be called that!) broke into three pieces. So I never actually got to use it.
1,broken stones,stones broke on 1st. use. cracked in several places. They appear to have been wet at some time. Will try to find new stones.
1,do not buy this POS!!!!,This thing is horrible!! it broke after the first use and it also nicked my jointer blades. i ended up going to woodcraft and purchasing the diamond sharpener for $37 and have used that with great results on my planner and jointer blades.
3,I'll keep it,"It's problem is that most jointer fences are too close (even when fully retracted), to get a good contact all the way to the inside edge of the knives. This means that the outside edge of the knife gets a good deal of contact, but the inside edge doesn't. There is a ""wedge"" effect created. I would have had to remove the fence, which would have been essentially more work than replacing the knives. It may be better to dress slightly dulled knives, rather than try to sharpen them. The inside edge problem only comes into play on full-width passes of stock. I like the item for this limited purpose. I bought a used jointer (Delta) and it brought the rusty knives back to an acceptable level in a relatively short time. The improvement was quite noticeable."
1,ARRIVED BROKEN,This is a sharpening stone. It arrived cracked most likely from the poor packaging. My husband does not want to use it on his new planer blades so we are returning it and getting another for replacement. What I don't understand is why I have to pay the return postage. Maybe I will get reimbursed.
4,Loved it!!,This is a really fun book. It‘s like watching a reality TV show. Lucy‘s life is hilariously fun and interesting
4,"Saucy Read, even for the Domesticated!","Read this book about a year ago, but saw that it is currently hitting the Kindle circuit!Funny, sexy, sweet, and smart. It will make you smile! Coburn's take motherhood is good, bad, and hilarious. For a fun peek at mommyhood and some of the challenges it can present to wife-dom, you cannot do better than this book!"
5,Fabulous,"This is a fabulous book for a new or young mom. Entertaining, upbeat, real and makes me feel like what I experience is normal! SO worth the money."
5,Loved it!,Really loved the book. It's funny...I mean laughing out loud funny at some of the stuff as a wife and mother we go through and the family in this is so unique. I am reading the second one now!
5,Wonderful!,"I have been enjoying this book but, once I got to Chapter 36, I realized I had to say this: Chapter 36 is worth the cost of the book whether it be a paper copy or the Kindle version. I've been hard pressed to figure out how to copy parts of that chapter and realized I'll just have to buy a hard copy."
4,lol funny,"Although it took a while to find the authors rhythm, this turned out to be a very funny read.If you need a laugh and need to know your not alone in the day to day mundane, try to find time to read this."
5,loved this book,"loved the story, loved the characters. Especially loved that the author made reference to lots of ""crunchy mama"" behaviors, and showed them in a positive light. She included the following in her story: no med natural birth, extended breast feeding, the breast crawl, breast feeding in public, sling wearing, delayed cord clamping, co-sleeping, and other things. These were not the focus of the book, but pleasant accompaniments to the story."
3,Entertaining read,"Tales from the Crib provided a few hours of entertainment. One reviewer accurately described it as a reality show. The scenario was a little over the top and some of the characters were rather extreme (to the point of being caricatures), but if you can suspend disbelief and just roll along with the story, it's a fun and witty novel."
4,Tales from the crib.,"Author has a delightful sense of humor. An enjoyable read.I read this on a vacation trip where I was interupted quite often. Easy to pick us where I left off.Jennifer Coburn has a nice style. Will follow her next book, takes off where this one left off.NICE."
3,Wacky heroine,"This is the 1st Jennifer Coburn book I read but acutually my least favorite. I was expecting a mommy book like the other Tales from the Crib (Risa Green), but it is more about the heroine's wacky life and less about being a mommy. It is a good book, but not as good as her others. There are a few passages of tirades/ soliloqy type stuff that just gets too long."
2,None,a confusing read with no real plot or storyline. it just went on and on jumping from random situation to another. waste of money because it should be free
3,Its Ok ! !,Had a good concept but it just didn't grab me like I thought it would. Did finish it even though it was pretty predictable what would happen at the end of the book.
3,Umm,I was expecting just the tales with Adam (the baby) not with her! WTF I'm only 13 so I was expecting a little story about tales from the crib not tales in mommys life!!!
1,crib,this book was enntertaining and well written however the main character is little whiney. and most of her baby situation is sympathy
5,Delicious!,"I was highly anticipating this new book and was definitely not disappointed! My only problem with Jennifer's book was that I couldn't put it down until I was finished. (my boss didn't like that much, and my son had to make his own lunch for two days, although my husband probably appreciated the quiet time!)Anyway, reading her new book made me laugh out loud (much like her main character), cry (because in a lot of ways I could relate), and smile because reading it was like hearing a story your best friend would tell you. It's got a lot of depth when it comes to the people who surround Lucy (main character), and gives me a lot of room to relate as I have a wide variety of friends as well as some eccentric family members. All in all I would recommend this book to any female across the nation! Now... how long till the next one!? ;)"
4,"Entertaining book, finished within a few days!","Very entertaining book, one of those books where it hooks you in with the first page. An overexaggerated tale of a woman whose husband dumps her right as she's about to tell him she's pregnant. Every bad thing that could happen to her, does! Overall a fun read!"
4,Better than I expected,This was my first Jennifer Coburn book and I will definitely read her again. I enjoyed her sense of humor and laughed out loud quite a few times.
4,The relatives in this story make it!,"The relatives in this story kept me laughing! Sadly, the actual storyline happens these days or a version of it, so kudos to Jennifer Coburn for addressing it! Great read!"
4,lifelike,"Funny, cute, poignant, satisfying, hilarious at time. Made me laugh, made me say yeah so true, a couple of times made me a bit uncomfortable by hitting too close to home. I am looking forward to reading the sequel."
2,needs improvement,"i expected more of what the main character really felt about their ""marriage arrangement"". Was she angry? Did she decide to stay because of finances or did she really still love her husband and would settle for less? It felt like she just went with the flow. I think the book's ideas was kind of scattered."
3,Pass it,I've read Jennifer Coburn's other books and thought I'd like this one just as much.I guess I couldn't get into it as much as the others probably due to to main character and the whole situation. Some of the other reviews mentioned that anyone can enjoy this book even though it's about pregnancy and motherhood. I shouldn't have listened. It was a bit boring and totally unrelatable to me.
5,It is worth your money,"This game rules although is only a 16-bit game. The best way to play this game is by using the arcade stick. Using the regular DC controller can be very difficult, especially when doing the special moves. If you are a SNK freak then this is a must have for your collection, but if you are not an SNK fan then give it a try."
4,Almost perfect,"Well first of all I own both Dream Match 99 for the DC which irecently got and i also own KOF 98 for the PS an imported ver. Onething that dissapointed me was that the American version of DM 99 for DC doesn't have blood. The japanese version has blood. Plus on the American ver of DM 99 is that if your the first player your stuck using the same lamo color. Nope cant change it. Unless u use the 2nd controller. Overall lots of improvements over the graphics especially the backgrounds. Overall the game lacks the sound and lacks no blood. If SNK of America keeps this up Im defently not buying it, If i were you i'd get an import of the game. Now one thing better about the KOF 98 for PS is that it's arcade perfect. Loading times are more improved. Voices sound alot better. But the oly problem is that the controller tends to get of your nerves. END"
5,The BEST KOF Game in the series!,"This game is one of the best KOF has to offer. Not only it contains one of the best graphics, but it comes with excellent music, many characters to choose from and the fighting mechanics are the best i've ever seen. Even though there's not a storyline to match up with, the characters however have their own team ending. For example, if you choose Kyo Kusanagi, Iori Yagami and Chriszu Kagama (the team of KOF 97) there is a picture of them as a team. There are many, many team edits you can choose from and what i've seen, KOF 1998 tops KOF 2002 hands down! I highly recommend to people who are huge fans of the KOF series or who have just started, KOF 1998 is the way to go!"
4,Possibly the most interesting of the Otherland Books,"In this book we finally get to see the Otherland network in some significant detail. I felt like many of the characters and themes were developed interestingly, and the worlds within the network at compelling. At the same time, it was a little frustrating because by the end of this volume I still had very little idea of what exactly was going on. Williams was very stingy with clues in this book, so while the story progresses, don't expect to have any better understanding of what's going on behind the scenes. You can only guess (and probably incorrectly) at the connections between the various themes and characters. Nevertheless, some of the best adventures and most interesting worlds (Bug World, Oz, the Kitchen, Abydos, London, Xanadu, Aerodromia, Venice...) appear hear."
3,Tad Williams needs an editor,"This whole shebang could have been written in 1000 pages. It is good, could be great if it wasn't so drawn out and, at times, unfocused.I have liked both books but the story gets tedious after the fourtieth virtual world that the characters experience.A good editor would have pared these four books down into one tight, cohesive but massive story in one book."
4,A complex weave of of life both in and out of reality.,"Tad Williams has done a great job with this book, slow read as it may be he is dedicated to ramping up the reader to invest an interest in the characters for who they could be and not what they seem to be. The description of the Otherworld brings to mind novel penned by John Myers Myers called, Sliverlock, JMM's characters flitter from one novelistic land and into another with the turn of the page leaving the reader to guess where they are, at least in TW novel the villian, of all people, was kind enough to tell us what worlds we might wander into, but left just enough unsaid so that we wanted to pick up the next two books and continue on the journey. I highly recommend it to those who enjoy a high fantasy with a twist and a dash of Techno-babble."
2,Boring...ouch my head hurts,"I started reading the Otherland series because of all the rave reviews here on Amazon. Plus Williams previous series ""Memory Sorrow...."" was superb. If the 1st book was ""mildly"" boring, then this is a huge bore. The book picks up whenever !Xabbu & Rene are involved or Fredricks & Orlando. Reading Martines ""diary"" gives me huge headache. Oh I'm sure I'll read books 3 & 4 some day. For now, I got much better books to read. Maybe in six months from now I'll come back to this series."
4,Not bad,"I have some issues with just about any book about computers and VR, and this one isn't any different. The final explanation in the third book helped, but my judgment was already clouded long before that.Looking past that though, the trilogy as a whole was enjoyable to read. There were definitely times I wanted some of the protagonists to stop making stupid choices, but then again, I guess there wouldn't be much story without people making stupid choices."
4,Good . But I expected better after reading Otherland Vol.1 !,"River of Blue Fire didn't have the tightness / level of excitement that one wd. have expected after Vol.1 -- which I rate as one of the classics at par with stuff like Dune , (the recent Uplift series by D. Brin too is another example), where each author has visualized a complete world / galaxy etc. both believable and fascinating -- Vol.2 unfortunately drags and sometimes gives the feeling of a complete lack of focus / plot line ! After reading Vol.1 I am sure that Mr. Williams can do much better -- so it's a bit dis-appointing to see that he hasn't cared to do so -- I will probably buy Vol.3 but more to see if TD's purpose has been to just sell based on past performance or really try to do an excellent job again and win back serious appreciators of this genre !! I hope he chooses to do what he has already demonstrated he can do extremely well given his capability and does justice to both his readers and himself !!!"
2,How come....?,"...modern sci-fi and fantasy writers think that they need to give us massive works that go on longer than War and Peace and Les Miserables put together? How about PLOT DEVELOPMENT! Unfortunately, Williams feels the need to wow us with how clever he is at creating alternate worlds, but suffers from the same problem Robert Jordan does...the plot grinds to a halt for hundreds of pages, until the poor reader needs to scream...""Get on with it, already!"". Frankly, after wading thru better than 1200 pages of the first two volumes, I hope I never encounter these characters again. So, if you are at all cruious about this series, wait for Book IV to be released in paperback, read the opening synopsis of the first three, and go on from there. Two stars (and the second one is merely because the fundamental idea is so good, but the execution ...I mean of the story, not necessarily the reader ! )"
1,Looks like another V.C. Andrews,"After the first volume of this series, though I don't like continuations, I was looking forward to this book. After finishing it, I think I would have been better off stopping after the first. None of the major questions or conflicts were answered or resolved. Early on I had the impression I'd just be passing time until I started the third book to find some answers and that's how the book ended. I'm not sure I'm even going to bother with the next book because I've found out there's a fourth book to be written. This definitely looks like another V.C. Andrews (Floweres in the Attic) for those people familiar with that author."
3,a bit of a letdown,"I was rivited with vol 1, and 'sold' many copies because of my enthusisam. However, I found vol 2 mostly tedious, but still read it voraciously as to get to the end! Found the 'kitchen' sequence a real drag, and while the image of giant salad tongs was meant to scarify, it was just a tad too silly for me... Ditto for the matches come to life. BUT I am still extremely engaged by Renie, Martine, Orlando, Sellers, etc... the 'original' cast is worth following, and I will follow til the bitter end. But the excitement and detail basically wasn't sustained from vol 1 - not unusual when setting up a series - I found this with Chung Kuo and Greg Bear's Eon/Eternity/Legacy.So, my review isn't totally laudatory, it is not a dismissal either. Michael in SuperNatural British Columbia"
3,Too much story,"I have nearly finished the third book in this series and I must say I have found it hard going. I really enjoyed the first book and I'm quite sure the last book will be good. But there is one book too many in this series. Volumes 2 and 3 should have been edited down to one volume as there are just too many environments the characters, and therefore the readers, are taken through, and as a result I feel the story bogs down. Limited to three volumes this would have been a much better paced story. But I suppose the publishers are getting richer making us buy an extra book."
4,Beautifully written but long...,"This was a well written book but at times the author was a bit long-winded. There were times when reading this book that I found the intricate descriptions amazing and yet there were other times when I wished the author would just get to the point. I'm an engineer and I enjoy details, however, keeping track of 12+ characters and all the different scenerios was a bit taxing. I am however looking forward to the next installment if only to find out what happens to these characters I have so much time invested in."
4,Better than the 1st,"I whined and moaned about how long the first volume of this series was, but after reading Vol.2 I am now converted and hooked. Sure - it's long, but I just had to learn to sit back and enjoy the lanquid pace of this incredibly colorful story unfolding. It was a welcome break from the world, and astounding storytelling. In the end - I was grateful for the length this time! That much more time to savor and enjoy it. I hope Williams can keep it up."
5,fantastic,"an absolutly wonderful tale that includes adventure, suspence and intrege.Also his imagination of the ever expanding world of IT could be spot on. overall thought, get the softback version of book 3 out asap!!!!! Nice one tad. Also anyone who could give some pointers on writing a fantasy novel drop us a line!cheers jim"
4,"Slower than the first, but you must trudge onward","Reading this book is a similar tale to those of the characters mucking their way through Otherland. At times the quest becomes tedious, but there is enough action to keep you flipping the pages and I always give Tad Williams the benefit of the doubt.I have to say that this book is as difficult as the first and dont think you are going to get through this in one night. I have to keep a timeline to keep up with the characters and where they are located.I am writing this review after having read the third book ""Mountain of Black Glass"" and I have to tell you to keep pushing forward because it gets much much better the farther on you go.RECOMMENDATIONS: KEEP GOING AND FINISH THE SERIES"
2,Trudge,"Thats a good word to describe this book, in comparison to the first one. The first one was great, a quick, fastpaced story with surprises and mystery throughout. This one, the characters are travelling on pointless 'adventures' through world after boring world. Zzzz. So, I had to trudge through this one.Barely anything important happens in this book, plotwise. If you don't have alot of time to waste reading detailed histories of Tad's one-stop fantasy-worlds, then just skip to the third book. Seriously, read the little blurb on what happens, and you will be no worse off.I found myself skimming through the pages to find something interesting. Not a good sign. Quite a disappointment after the marvelous first book. The cover art is quite nice, at least."
1,WHOOPS !,People who buy BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER books only buy this book by mistake.It is a porn comic book.It has nothing to do with BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER.
2,waste of money,"ok, let me start that I had high hopes for this video.The real problem in it is that they don't actually teach you anything!OK, they do teach the basics, buy if you already played some billiard then you alerady know that. If you bought this tape you probably wanted to improve your game and not learn what the bridge hand is!The second half of the tape is a complete waste! The players just show off their perfect games without explaning what they are doing and most improtantly HOW THEY ARE DOING IT.The trick shots section is a waste of time since they don't teach you how to do it. They just do it! Good for them!to sum things up: don't waste your money here, go shop for some clothes instead!"
3,Excellent only if you are a beginner cook with children,"When I purchased this book, I had read an article on Mr. Blumenthal revolutionary approach to food preparation. I was disappointed with this book since it does not offer any insight in said approach as he practises in his restaurant The Fat Duck. His approach is most intriguing so I would like to read about his philosophy on food. His book Family Food is valid for a parent who, being a beginner cook, wants to get his kids interested in food preparation, but it offers very little to anyone who has been cooking for a long time and knows the basics such as how to cook lentils or make a basic couscous, etc... I would have liked to read about some of the intriguing combinations by Mr Blumenthal such as white chocolate and caviar..."
5,Long live #3,Great book - I especially appreciate that it puts to rest the myth that Dale's father died while working on a race car. Dale Earnhardt worked hard for everything success in his life and this book tells all about the bad times as well as the good. I was glued to it from page 1. It also reminds me of how NASCAR hasn't been the same without him.
2,Well-written rehash,"There is some new insight into Earnhardt's life and career, but there's far too much about Earnhardt's fans in the infields of race tracks.Been there, done that. Don't need to read about the guys who camped next to me last race.Very well written, though. But that's what you expect from Leigh Montville, from his Boston Globe days and his Sports Illustrated articles."
5,the real EARNHARDT story,"one of if not the greatest book i have ever read!!! this book hit on everything that was ""The Man in Black"", ""The Intimidator"". MUST READ"
5,Montville rocks!,"Leigh Montville is the best sports writer of our era. His conversational, approachable, witty prose is so much fun to read. This is one of his best books."
5,This is some top-quality music here!,"Adagio was an experiment for me. I love it when my expectations are surpassed. Every song on this disc is really awesome. There may be an ever-so-slight Symphony X flavor, but Adagio is certainly unique. There is a very strong classical presence here, especially with the keys. Unlike most classical rockers, which tend to have the same drum beat in every song, Adagio maintains the ever changing element of Prog. Singer David Readman is awesome. His range and power is phenominal. I consider him one of the best singers in the genre. Stephan Forte is a world class musician, not just a great guitarist. His solos are tasty, yet display a measure of melodic restraint. The keys are very strong as well. The drums are also very strong. Again, not the typical constant doublebass that many power metal bands use. All the songs are great, but ""Second Sight"" really gets the album off to a good start is is the most solid song on the album. Buy this album, I HIGHLY recommend it!"
3,"pretty good, not great tho","this is a good album, nice to pop it in and lay on the bed... but theres something missing. certain flavour. the element of surprise i guess...still worth buying. specially for prog/power lovers. and also for ones who are newbies in this whole metal business :)"
5,braun toothbrush review,I love these toothbrushes. So easy for those of us who always travel or like to brush at work.
2,Too Expensive For The Results,"While this device does save some labor, its price and the additional costs of replacement brushheads and batteries are not justified by the results, which is not different from those of manual toothbrushes."
2,Didn't like it,"Item cracked and broke after only about 3 days of wearing it, it was cheaply made and a waste of money."
4,Powerful story,"The landscape was breath taking. The message of the story was intense, you sometimes have to lose something to get something. Roy was incredible. Love that man."
4,Worked well.,"It has plenty of power for a 1/2 inch drill. The hammer drill operation made drilling in concrete much easier.Reverse does seem a little weak, but I can't see that this would be a problem since it is only used to back the bit out.I'd also like to add that it is not made in China--that made it a big plus for me. It was made in Ireland and the chuck was made in Germany. Some other Hitachi models, as well as many other name brand drills, are made in China."
5,Bon Aire,"Nicely made, slim and easy to install on any air compressor. I really like this product and would purchase again."
3,One of those rare cases where the film eclipses the novel.,"Forrest Gump the novel falls so far short of Forrest Gump the film that I hardly think it is worth reading. I am grateful that it was written, because the film is beautiful.The novel, however, is lacking all of the sincerity and heart of the film. It is entertaining and fun, but it is also forced and unbelievable in a way that tops even the film.I say, if you think about reading this book, save yourself the time and watch the movie again. You'll get everything you would get from the book and more. Unless you really like orangutans...In that case read the book."
1,What happened?,"What a waste of time.If a book is different from its film adaptation, fine, no problem. But a poorly written, completely ill-planned story is another matter. I am not sure if the author was attempting humor or what? What exactly was the purpose of publishing this book?The movie was great. Not sure how the filmmakers could get the idea for Forrest Gump the movie from this book."
2,Stupid is as Stupid Does,"A few months back I watched the movie again and was well underwhelmed by my memory of how magical it was. The book didn't do much to bolster my opinion. The plot is similar even if it differs in many places. Forrest is very much the idiot sevant, but his adventures are mostly different. The book is funny in many places, and several times I laughed out loud. However, it fell short in trying to make me care about the characters or in its attempt at satire.(...)"
5,Better Late,Very good read. I had always wished I'd read the book before the movie came out. I was very surprised how different the book is from the movie. Must read more Winston Groom.
5,Liked the Movie? Love the Book.,"Yet another example of how a movie will have a tough go of giving a book true representation. Winston Groom is masterful at creating our sympathetic protagonist and you feel for him at every step of the way. But, the best part, and maybe the most important part, of the book is that you can't help but be right inside Gump's head. You're not just reading Gump, you begin to feel Gump when you turn each and every page. You're living Gump.Do yourself a favor and try to forget the movie before you start reading this. But know that if you don't, Tom Hanks at least did Gump justice and having him in mind while you read isn't such a bad thing."
4,i had to do this,"This is a good book. It varies greatly from the movie, but most books do. Forrest Gump, by Winston Groom, is a novel that portrays the different paths chosen, or in some cases not chosen, of the main character Forrest Gump. The narrarator of this novel is Gump himself. He is repeatidly put in situations where he is almost certain to fail, but yet he always succeeds. Gump is repeatidly ridiculed and says he is unable to achieve his goals but always does."
2,Fantasy and not too good,"This 1986 novel bears no rsemblance to the movie. In the book Gump does all the stuff the movie character fantasizes about--is a football hero, wins the Medal of Honor, does space travel, is successful pro wreestler(as ""the Dunce""), plays cahmpionship chess, becomes a millionaire. At first it was funny but after about 50 pages it was fantasy and I have seldom had much longing for fantasy. So, the movie is better."
1,What a terrible book!!!,The genius behind the success of Forrest Gump certainly lies within the screen writers of Hollywood and not the author of this book. Hats off to them....that they could take this gibberish and make a GREAT movie from it.
4,Book Review,"This book was VERY different from the movie. I had to get myself out of the movie mindset to really begin to enjoy this well written, enjoyable book."
1,Gump as White Trash,"From lovable simpleton to mean spirited dumb-ass PWT. Now I know why they screwed Groom out of his royalties after the movie was made. His story is unbelievable. The movie is an adaptation and thank God for once the old saying, ""the book's better"" doesn't apply."
4,"Good story, easy to read","I enjoyed this book. I had, of course, previously seen the movie and I like both. Parts of the story get kind of cheesy and feel like a bad 80's buddy cop movie but I suppose that adds some charm."
1,a real disappointment,"As a person who usually enjoys a book much more than the movie, this was the exception to my rule. What a flavorless, racist character Forest was in this book. I had very little empathy for his situations. I was disappointed in the portrayal of his relationship with Jenny. The movie warms your soul. The book makes you ask - they made a movie out of this?????"
3,Woo Clone (Woo Woo!!),The first hour of this film is a pretty laboured comedy. The last 20 minutes is a low-budget gunbattle of the first order. It's a primer on quick cutting and camera placement and worth seeing just to cop the editor's chops. (VHS copy reviewed.)
3,Not for macs,"Great piece of equipment. easy to setup the fax machine and the copier feature works fast.However, if you have a mac and saw this as a great deal like I did, it's not for you. I ended up returning it. :(so disappointed that it's not universally supported."
1,"Lies, lies, lies!","Does NOT support older operating systems. The Amazon description says it will work with Windows 2000/ME. So does the description on the box. So do the instructions on the inside. After 2 hours setting this thing up, I got to the last instruction, which was to download the drivers. To make a long story short, YOU CAN'T GET THEM from Lexmark. The helpful tech support people suggested I buy a new computer! After searching for a couple of hours, I managed to find the drivers on a website called Open Drivers, and now I can print and scan. Lexmark was no help."
4,Good Value,"I've been using this printer for about 4 months now and I'm very pleased with it. It was easy to set up and produces a good quality printout. It is a bit noisey and the copier feature is a bit clumsy to use, but it all works fine."
2,Oops...no cable and other surprises,"Knowing that my old laserjet at my summer workplace did not have a USB port, and that my new lightweight portable had no printer port, I had a Lexmark X8350 shipped ahead. When I opened it up, the quick-install sheet had a little diagram of a USB cord with a note it had to be purchased seaparately. Not off to a good start. Next discovery was that I was not supposed to use the computer's ""new hardware found"" install wizard...I absolutely had to load the software off their CD. Well, you guessed it...no CD drive. After I buy an external CD drive, it will no doubt be an excellent printer as the other reviews suggest. Until then... It would have been nice if they'd told me."
4,Lwxmark X8350,"USB cable, black/color ink included in the package.Very easy to install: clar instruction provided, even who is not familiar w/computer won't have any problem.Excellent b/w and color print (didn't try photo).Excellent scanner and copy.Easy to use, excellent quality, excellent price for this multifunction printer."
3,Good Printer for price,"This is a good choice for the price. Prints both blk&white and color pages pretty quickly, the scanner quality is also decent. The automatic copy feeder can be a little quirky and can only feed a few pages at a time but once again for the price I can't really complain."
3,Excellent bargain disk,"This is a very cheap DVD that presents (8) representative Betty Boop cartoons. These are not among her best, but most in this group are very good & offer a pretty good sampler of the series. The picture quality is very good -- far better than the price would suggest. I hope someday GoodTimes (or somebody) releases the best Boops (like ""Snow White"" and ""Minnie the Moocher"") but this disk nevertheless offers a good selection at a great price."
1,NOT THAT GOOD !,I previewed this before buying. I knew it wasn't great. I liked only two tunes on it. It was the cheapest CD purchase alternative for the two tunes barring the 99 cent download option. I bought the CD instead. I don't recommend this.
2,"Flawed ""Christian""-biased history","This book has some interesting and informative aspects. However, it is deeply flawed by the author's ""Christian"" point of view. The USA has entrepreneurs that are Hindu, Muslim, Jewish, Catholic, Luteran, Baptist, and atheist, as well as every other religion and philosophy imagineable. So, it is just ridiculous and biased to highlight those entrepreneurs that profess a certain strain of the Protestant Christian religion."
1,Waste of time and money,"I was given this book as a graduation gift by someone who had bought it but couldn't plod through it. I can see why. It's poorly written and there's no usable information inside. Plus it's boring. So in the interest of accuracy I would rename it ""365 Ways To Waste Your Time And Money."""
4,Oldie but Goodie,"This C.d.I used to own on vinyl and it disappeared, probably loaned out to someone who didn't return it. It was a trip down memory lane to hear it again. I love the old school Gospel music, strong vocals sung with conviction and a strong undiluted message in the words of the songs. This is a great C.D made by some great people e.g. Shirley Caesar and Albertina Walker. Thought it very timely that I purchased it just before Albertina Walker's passing away. This lady is still blessing people from the grave with her music, wonderful!!"
1,Serious engineering problem,"The radio will not stay in contact with the power plug when seated in the cradle of the boombox, consequently the radio quits playing intermittently or won't play at all. This is my second one, I returned the first, and both had the same problem. Save yourself some grief and don't buy this."
3,"Whose favorite opera is ""Attila"" ?","Attila is not everybody's cup of tea. I happen to love it. However, not necessarily this production. Although Nesterenko is a very convincing Hun with a great voice to match, the production is dark and uninteresting. I have heard Maria Chiara to better effect elsewhere. Here she tends to be shrill when she gets to her top notes. Yet it is probably more down to earth, so to speak, than the one I prefer despite its high cant, namely Riccardo Muti's with Sam Ramey, Carol Studer and Giorgio Zancanaro. Not only is the singing great but the opera comes actually alive."
4,Very handy and comprehensive,"We just got back from a whirlwind trip to Stockholm and this book was with me every step of the way. Like all the books in this series, it is very detailed with lots of pictures, illustrations and information. I found myself reading it on the plane trip home because the pictures let you re-live the trip. The information in the book was all accurate and up-to-date. My only complaint is that they like everything...I wish they would offer a few more opinions like ""Don't miss!"" or ""If you have time, okay, but not worth a special trip."" I did use this book in conjunction with the Lonely Planet guide to Sweden which is much more opinionated. Together, the two books were all I needed for a very successful trip."
5,"Informative and Excellent ""On-The-Go"" Quick Reference","This book is wonderful! Aside from excellent descriptions of hotels, shopping and tourist sites, the ""street finder"" is very useful."
4,Awesome moody Music,"do not let the name scare you...this music is awesomely moody...the lyrics are very deep featuring the citings of Isaac Newton and other intellectual literary giants. Man, this stuff rocks, slow, but so incredibly mesemorizing......music that really makes you think .....the band is not comprised of some tattooed high school drop outs but by honorable students from a seminary......listen to them and you are going to be absolutely blown away"
5,These guys are incredible!,"An obviously original sound, these guys have managed to make some mind blowing music. They deserve all the best in the world. Geniuses."
4,Comrades and Chicken Ranchers: The Story of a California Jewish Community,"This is a delightful read for anyone interested in oral history, from the author's introduction and methodology to the actual words of Petaluma community members. This book shows in a personal way how a small, rural Jewish community was affected over the course of three generations by changes in the larger world."
2,A flawed work,"I spent part of my childhood--I'm 64--on my Jewish grandparents' chicken ranch in Petaluma so I am quite familiar with the material of this book. I was very disappointed with Kann's decision to create composite characters and can see no real reason for him to have done so. It is not a true oral history, which is a shame. Did he have an editor?"
3,Not much of a story here,"Unfortunately all the pieces are there, except the story. To say the story is weak implies that there is one. Things happen, but for no apparent reason, and the sequence of events doesn't add up to a coherent or compelling story. It's more of ""a day in the life""...of a hustler. If this is your interest, then you will like this.Having said that, the acting and editing are strong and David Arqette is a likeable and convincing principal character. It's okay overall, but not very compelling, despite it's relatively polished feel."
1,A hustler at it's worst,"With hopeful expectations of a modern reincarnated Joe Dallesandro movie, I found myself beyond dissapointed. Even a bigger put-down was the fact that Siskel and Ebert gave the loser ""two thumbs up"". What you actually wind up with, is a sorry mutated version of ""Trick"" and ""Looking for Mr. Goodbar"" rolled-into-one. Even more distasteful, was the haunting ""stereotypical"" music in the background. Instead of collecting money to fulfill a drug habit, the main character ""John"", begs, borrows, and steals, to try and buy the ""one- day-high"" of staying at ""The Plaza"". How completely unrealistic, as was this entire film. I would not only give it ""two thumbs down"", but two big toes as well. Do yourself a favor and watch something from the 60's or 70's, and put this piece of rubbish out to pasture."
3,The Boys Are Back in Town,"A somber and at times depressing indie movie about the friendship of two male hustlers, ""johns"" is a fine debut for filmmaker Scott Silver. Urban and dark, yet still emotional, this story focuses the loneliness and little hope of two young adults, presenting a moving and gripping drama. David Arquette is great as the lead character and Lukas Haas is competent as his sidekick, even if the plot isn`t all that great and innovative. Melancholic and heartfelt, ""johns"" is a pleasant surprise.Worth watching."
3,Worth a Look,"Not-bad calling card for Hollywood, until you realize that the director's next project was ""The Mod Squad"" a movie that lacks any of the potential shown here. Although this movie about El Lay hustlers has its faults--too many trite plot trappings when a solid character piece lurks beneath--the performances are very good. David Arquette, Lukas Haas, and ""guest star"" Elliott Gould are very effective. Contains the expected abundance of ""F words"" and seedy situations."
3,Haas and Arquette save this movie,Movie has uneven editing and symbolism that isn't needed. But the strong performances of Haas and Arquette make it a worthwhile look. I liked the Hollywood ending which may not satisfy some viewers. I liked this better than My Own Private Idaho which has a similar theme.
2,pretty bad,"waited for this video in a lower price and glad that I did as this movie is no comparison to Midnight Cowboy and the story is weak very slow and Luke Haas was not very effective at all. Credit goes to David Arquette as he did a great job but did not get the backing that he needs and can see why it did not make it to the big screen. Sorry,folks. I was so bored and only David kept me awake."
2,Is that all there is?,"Depressing is the first word that comes to mind. I've know hustlers and Haas and Arquette just didn't measure up! If I was the type that cruised, I definitely wouldn't pick up these two mangy, unkept, seedly looking characters. I assume the story has a message but somehow I missed it. All I could think of was UGH!"
3,There Is Humor But It Isn't A Comedy,"The VHS packaging calls this a ""dark comedy-drama"", and there is a level of street humor totally missing from two more famous films with similar subject matter, MY OWN PRIVATE IDAHO and TWIST. That said, there is almost nothing funny about it. This is one of those films that seems to be made so that it can NEVER be shown on commercial television. There is lots of swearing, sexual situations and some seriously disturbing violence permeates the film from beginning to end.The Christian symbolism is laid on with a trowel, but the acting is uniformly good. Arquette and Haas are tremendously watchable in unappealing roles.I don't think that I would want to watch this a second time. It is just way too violent, but there are some remarkable moments, especially an ineffably touching last encounter between Arquette and Richard Kind as a sympathetic hotel clerk."
2,Dr. Death? Dr. Dull!,A surprisingly melancholy installment in the Alex Delaware series. Even Delaware himself seemed less than enthusiastic about tracking down the killer of the fictional Dr. Kevorkian--was that intentional (hinting of disenchantment with the job?) or just laziness? An especially disappointing selection considering the strength of the last one.
3,Not his personal best,"Although this is an interesting topic that has previously received a lot of media attention, I really didn't feel this book lived up to the other books by this author. Usually it is the firm grasp on the concept of psychological thrills that compels me to read works by Mr. Kellerman. This book just didn't have the same edge as some of his other books. I finished it, and it certainly wasn't poorly written or contrived, it just wasn't my personal favorite and by the last couple of chapters I found I was glad to be nearly finished with it. He is an amazing author and a genius when it comes to writing skillful suspense, but this one just left me numb."
2,Disappointed,"Dr. Death (aka Dr. Eldon Mate) is responsible for many assisted suicides. Dr. Mate is brutually murdered and the story revolves around who killed the doctor. There are too many extraneous plots and suspects. I felt that these were techniques used to only add pages to the storyline and to add a little suspense here and there. By page 116 (out of 352 pages) I was beginning not to care who did it. I am a great fan of Jonathan Kellerman, particularly the Alex Delaware series, and have read all of his books. This book is not his best and definitely not of the high standards as his other psychological thrillers."
2,A series on the wane,"For the past few Delaware books, the structure has been tediously similar: Alex (with or without Milo) goes from person to person and asks questions. Eventually, he figures out who the killer is, there is a single action scene and then it ends.Alex is getting to be less and less of a character. His girlfriend serves almost no purpose to the story, not even as a sounding board. In this story, even the concluding action scene is pretty minor, and in the only other scene of any real violence, Alex is threatened with no more than a sore jaw.Billy Straight shows that Kellerman still knows what he's doing, but the Delaware books seem to just go through the motions. It's time for either rebirth or retirement for this series."
2,Disappointed,"This was my first Kellerman novel. The book started off well, and kept me interested, but waned badly in the end. Too many subplots left unresolved. The ending was anticlimactic and unresolved. Perhaps future novels will tie the lose strings together, but this novel did not leave me with the desire to continue with the seris."
2,Disappointed,"This was my first Kellerman novel. I thought it was well written, and enjoyed it until the end. What a disappointment. Very anticlimatic and left too many subplots unresolved. Perhaps these will be tied together in future novels, but it did not leave me with the urge to read any continuing novels."
3,Not one of Kellerman's best,"This is not one of Kellerman's best books, but I was not disappointed to read it. I have to read all Kellerman's books!"
1,Dr. Death not up to Kellerman's usual quality,"The characters were interesting, but no one in the story would I want to live next door to. Otherwise, carelessly plotted, murky in exposition, NO ACTION at all, with the bulk of the story being Stream-of Consciousness psychobabble."
2,A waste of time and waste of money,"Jonathan Kellerman has almost always been a sure thing in terms of writing an interesting mystery. With Dr. Death he somehow lost his touch. It almost seems as if he's playing around with a sort of Philip Marlow/ 40's detective writing style in the beginning of the book and then he abruptly goes back to his typical writing style. Kellerman also throws in an obligatory and really boring love scene with Alex Delawares annoying and self abosorbed live in girlfriend Robin. The problem with Dr. Death is the barely fleshed out characters (other than Delaware and Milo and the dog) and that it tries to be a commentary on euthanasia and the movement that surround it. Kellerman should stick to writing what he writes best. All mystery-no social commentary, and most of all no Robin-it's time for a new love interest---Petra perhaps?"
3,Haven't I read this before??,"Jonathan Kellerman is a great author, and he tells a good story. Unfortunately, it seems like he's telling the same story over and over again. I think perhaps he needd a new charachter. And personally, I'm sick of reading about euthanasia issues."
3,"Once again, just not bad.","Alex Delaware and Milo Sturgis are back... and the results are entertaining but forgettable. This is a good listen; well-performed, and holds your interest. But for those of us who've read a lot of Kellerman, he's become master of the three-sentence-fragments-followed-by-a-rhetorical-question gimmick. Like this:Scripted plot. Increasingly flat characters. Stagnant formula. Time to get out of a rut?"
2,My introduction to this author,"Having had Jonathan Kellerman recommended highly to me, I gave him a try with this book. Without reviewing the plot, I'll admit it moves quickly, despite extraneous information on virtually every page. I could have done without Dr. Delaware's sexual unions with his wife, for example, and without his detailed word maps of Los Angeles streets. These are minor flaws. The major flaw is that there is not one single character here that a reader can like or find entertaining. The victim, the cops, Dr. Delaware himself, the young woman Dr. Delaware is counseling, her nasty brother, her nasty father, etc. The novel left a rather bitter aftertaste, as if I had eaten something that was on the verge of being spoiled and vaguely poisonous. Would I read another by Kellerman? Perhaps--just to see if this is the norm or if Dr. Mate's death (see matar in a Spanish dictionary) brought out the worst in people."
1,Had to finally close the book,"I have read every book Jonathan Kellerman has written. This is the only book of his that I finally gave up on. Kept waiting for it to grab me. Didn't happen, but he will continue to be my favorite author."
1,Not up to snuff - and fat phobic,"I usually really like Jonathan Kellerman's books, but the psychological understanding in this book was limited at best. Although it's a current topic (""assisted suicide""), the author really didn't add much to the topic. I also found very offensive the presentation of one of the characters who had, as Kellerman described it, gone to bed and eaten until she had almost doubled her weight. She was presented in a very unsympathetic view - almost as if she was a criminal, and most of the other characters seemed to be horrified by how fat she had gotten, as if being fat were a mortal sin. I'd expect a little more psychological understanding from Kellerman. I found that the book left a bad taste in my mouth (or in my mind)."
4,Intoxicating tale,"Jonathan Kellerman has struck gold again. Dr. Alex Deleware is back to assist detective Milo Sturgis. The relationship between Deleware and Sturgis is just as interesting as the story itself-comfortable and weary at the same time. The two are a little more at odds than usual in the murder investigation of a doctor who assists his patients in suicide. There are a large number of suspects in the tale. What makes this book most interesting are the two ethical questions raised; 1. Assisted suicide, and 2. Doctor/patient confidentiality. Kellerman does a very good job of presenting the issues in a balanced way, seeming to take neither side of each issue. This book was absorbing, keeping me awake until long past my normal bed time. Don't let this Kellerman thriller pass you by."
3,Breezy Read,"I described this book as breezy to a friend who asked about it. It is an easy read, compelling enough to hold your interest and make you want to finish. The characters, of course, are well known to any Kellerman reader. Milo (the gay LAPD detective) is barely present in this book. Alex Delaware is the forensic psychologist and main character.The plot is centered on a Dr. Kevorkian style MD who assists ""travelers"" on their journey to death. He is found brutally slain in his euthanesia van hooked up to his own death machine. There are a number of potential suspects and red herrings as well as sub-plots The denouement is interesting and offers up some poetic justice.Justice appeals to me. I still enjoy it when good prevails over evil. Therefore, I like this book.If you're looking for entertainment without literary complexity, this book could be just the ticket."
3,he has his own agenda,"If youre reading this, youre probably a 'falling away' JW. And this book certainly is interesting, telling the story of a young man growing up in 1930s Kansas, totally immersed in Witness doctrine till he realised something was missing and gradually became a Baptist (he's now a pastor). But his insistence on Hell, the existence of the trinity etc are probably not something you'd feel convinced by even if you have doubts on witness theology. You feel he's trying to convert you. I wouldn't say dont read it but there are vastly more helpful books for those seeking enlightenment, notably Raymond Franz's WONDERFUL 'Crisis of Conscience'."
4,User,We have used this and the imges are very good. It worked immediatly and well with Skype. This is a very nice addition to the voice ability on skype. We are looking forward to continue using this to communicate with family.
3,Basic video,"I picked up this webcam on trial, and am planning on returning it. Setup with Mac (Leopard) was basically plug-n-play. Picture quality was my main issue. Washed out, no color depth, not clearly focussed (even with several tries, under different light conditions). Not bad for the price, but not quality of my former QuickCam Messenger."
1,Very poor quality camera - waste of $$,"I bought this as a xmas gift only to be extremely dissappointed.First: This camera has a wire mircrophone that you must keep in your ear the entire time so the recipient can hear you (even if you leave the audio unplugged). Very annoying.Second: The picture quality is EXTREMELY grainy!! (Good if you don't want people to see the details of your face!) Even if you have a decent light on in your house, it is still very blurred/grainy and VERY pixalated (and has an orange-like tint) no matter what light is on.I would not waste your $$ on this one. It's a piece of JUNK. Spend a few more bucks on one that is worth it. Believe me, you will be better off."
2,Not a high quality camera,"I was disappointed with the video noise level. It is really high. In addition, the clip does not attach the camera to a notebook or a flat panel very well. I suggest investing a little bit more and buy a higher quality camera."
2,You get what you pay for!,The camera looks nice but the video quality is very poor. I would suggest spending the extra money for a good cam.
3,Inexpensive and it shows,"Tricky to set up--lots of bugs in my case. Included ""headest"" is an earbud and mic--works but very tinny and chintzy."
4,good enough for basic webcam,"nothing spectacular, just does the basics well.Details aren't great, but hey if you have a bad haircut the person on the other end won't notice."
4,Early Kalima & swing out sister fans take note!,"You will love it, it's angular jazz funk and still freshly weird!Only complaint: WHERE is ""FLESH"" as the other reviewer pointed out its absence as well.that song is so freaking amazing with its weird sleazy 70s porn groove and Ann Quigley's tripped out overdubbed moaning and the out of key saxes--somewhere between A Certain Ratio and Throbbing Gristle w/ Astrud Gilberto in bondage thrown in. Fabulous and sublime cut from 1981 no less! (all while the world slept)It has to be heard to be believed and would've MADE this CD perfect."
1,Immoral Tradition,"Be forewarned. The ""Catholic"" here is a wooly blend of relativism, consequentialism, proportionalism and plain old pique from a theologian censured by the Vatican. For the real story, buy John Paul II's Veritatis Splendor."
3,Entertaining but ...,"Star Strike is an entertaining novel on the face of it. The plot is at least as old as sci-fi, and probably older. You could realistically argue that some of it originated with Homer and the Odyssey. That said there are a lot of rather irritating failures in detail. One that makes me grit my teeth whenever I encounter it - and that happens fairly often these days - is the ""polar geostationary orbit."" A geostationary orbit is possible only over the equator. A polar orbit probably could be set up that passed over the same point on the equator once in 24 hours, but that would not be geostationary. You would think that someone writing sci-fi would know that. There are other hickups, such as how Russians, Britons and Americans are portrayed, and there is a certain lack of character development as well. It is implicit, but never really visible. Still, the aliens were interesting, and it would have been worth a second novel to see how the situation resolved."
2,"542 pages of eh, I really wanted to like it","My preference is anything Starship Troopers/Forever War, this was somewhat misleading. Of course it doesn't compare, but I wanted for it to be like the other 2. When your characters are from different nationalities, you're expected to get stereotypes, as previous reviewers noted. This was done too overtly. The book was just too long for my taste. I wanted action, there is none. I'm sure for some, the lengthy getting-to-it, might be enjoyable. I was miguided by the cover and title. There's nothing really military about it, even though it's about military people(and some CIA and KGB), but mostly military. If it'd be shorter and had more action, maybe. The Ahmisa and Pashti appearance, history, and thought process were originl but, as expected, foreign(too much)."
3,Khan - No Comprendo,"The ever independent and individualistic Khan embraces vocals on NO COMPRENDO -- which might be, ironically, his more pop-accessible album thus far. The French electropop of ""Les Gros Nichons"" probably won't find much airplay, but it's Gallic charm is undeniable. Kid Congo Powers, on ""Why Hurt Flesh,"" continues the cabaret from hell sound reminiscent of his work with Nick Cave, but now placed in an electronic framework, though the guitars are still menacing, a mood which continues on the dubby ""The Wolf"" and the blues-influenced ""Monster"" and ""Mercy Mama."" Julee Cruise adds her ethereal voice to the Latin-tinged ""Say Goodbye"" and Diamanda Galas goes quasi-operatic on the eerie ""Aman."" But the overall effect of the album is uneven -- seems like a concept album when the concept isn't fully thought out. But there's no misunderstanding the individual tracks."
3,"cute earrings, bad shipping","For me personally, the photo of these earrings is a little better than the actual product, and they were a littler larger on my ears than I wanted, but that's what happens when you shop by photo only. They don't work for me, but I think they are cute enough for my niece who will be getting her ears pierced soon, and I will save them for her. The shipping was another matter. Most jewelry I order comes in little boxes with gift bags or ribbon - a nice touch. These felt like they were just thrown in a mailer and sent. The posts were bent since there were not protected, and I worried they could break or be weak when I straightened them. So far so good. Maybe a little more attention to detail?"
5,The epitome of rock and roll,"I picked up this cd in a small record store in Ohio and was blown away. The Stripped cut of Wild Horses is the same but the import also has cuts from their small club tour. This cd has the greatest cut of Gimmie Shelter I have ever heard. The vocals of Mr. Jagger and backup singer Lisa are wonderful, not to mention that Mr. Richards does his finest work on the Gibson 335 in this cut. Since it was recorded in a small club you get the echo sound against the concrete walls. The tracks of tumbling dice and live with me are also the best I have heard. If you like the stones or just like good hard rock and blues pick this one up"
4,Plastair HoseKoil PU450-1-3-AMZ 1/4-Inch x 50-Foot Polyurethane Lead Safe Ultra-Light Recoil Air Hose,"I am very pleased with the flex hose, especially 50 feet. Not sure how long this will last, but it is really convenient. Once you use this type hose, you will not return to the ""hard to roll"" air hose. Again, all of you will like this for wood working and general duty. Not sure if this is recommended for industrial use. Hope this helps."
2,leaky hose,"This product started leaking air at the swivel joint. It started out very slow,now that the swivel part has moved and rotated, you can hear and feel the leak.I'm paet my return date, also tested in soapy water to confirm the leak.The hose seems well made and its flexible thats why I gave it two stars."
5,Wonderful Tea,This tea is great hot or cold. I like mine cold with Spenda. It will only take about 2 bags to make a full pitcher of iced tea. It has a lovely flavor of Lavender that is not too over powering. Nice on a hot day. Great hot after a long day at work to unwind. Tin is really nice too. I tend to save them for things like thumb tacks.Great that it is Fair Trade. Most people don't know what that is but its good to know that what I buy is helping someone else far away.Try the tea. You will love it.
1,Just because you like rooibos and lavender doesn't mean you'll like this,"I love rooibos and I love lavender, but somehow the combination in this tea has created the most vile tea I have ever tasted. I've never had a tea that I thought was so gross that I actually had trouble drinking it except for one that had stevia in it. I don't like the taste stevia sweetened things have and it seems like this tea has that same taste. I was so sure I'd love this tea, I'm glad I didn't buy it here first (I almost did), I only have to figure out what to do with one canister instead of six."
5,some of the best herbal tea ever!,"I love this tea, and drink it hot or cold. There's an almost sweet note to it, the rooibos tea provides some perceived sweetness. The lavender is perfect- it's there, but not too perfumey.A coworker and I discovered our shared love for this tea, and we bought a 6 pack, thinking we could give some as gifts and have a stash for a while. We were right.It's nice to know I won't run out of this tea for another year. If there's an earthquake or other natural disaster, I'll flavor my bottled water with it and pretend I'm fancy."
2,My dog didn't like it,"My dog has yet to fetch this toy outside. I don't know if it is the smell or what, but he will not play with it."
1,Dogs won't touch them,"I bought two of these toys for my mini schnauzer. I got them and they had a really strong rubber smell. It was enough to stink up my car. I figured I'd leave them out to air. A week later, they still smell as bad. My dog takes a sniff of the toy and wants nothing to do with them. I wrote to the manufacturer to get suggestions on how to get rid of the smell, but they never replied.The other problem with toy is that it's advertised that it floats. Technically, it does float but it floats just below the surface of the water. When I throw it in the water, the dog starts looking for it, but can't find it.For my dog, at least, this toy is not a winner."
5,Good for the brother and sister tug,My 2 Miniature Schnauzers use this for tug and running around the house holding it half and half
2,Tought there would be three toys,"Saw this and though wow what a great price for three durable toys! I should have known. Only one came in the mail and it was rather large - we plan to cut it in half. Although we may not have to, our dog doesn't want to play with it, I think it's the smell. We tried putting it in a large bag of treats overnight to help with the smell. She still didn't seem interested. We did stuff a beggin strip in the ends and she seems to try and get them out but other than that she is not interested in this toy what so ever. Our dog LOVES to chew on and rip up toys so we thought this one would be good for her...we wouldn't buy it again."
3,Maybe for some dogs...,"The RuffDawg sticks were supposed to be incredibly durable.. And maybe for a medium or less chewer they are fine, but my Vizsla, who is only 8 months put it into pieces in less the 6 hours. We let him have it for a little while, picked up the chunks, then gave it back but it was officially thrown away in quarter sized pieces within 6 hours."
2,Hollow and destroyable.,"These sticks aren't a truely horrible product, but they're definately not made for tough or frequent use. They're certainly not for chewers and can't hold up to a lot of use. I own a year old lab mix who played with this outside with me for about 30 minutes before tearing the end of it off. I didn't expect it to be hollow either, which isn't good for long-term use. I would only recomend it to someone if they own a medium sized dog such as a spaniel."
3,"Bigger than expected, not the color i ordered","These are much bigger than expected, and too big fory dogs, but, they are easily cut in half and work in this way. I ordered a lime colored one because it was on lightning deals. I recieved a yelevenlow one, so obviously color selection is pointless. They reek of rubber and required several washings before the dogs would even look at them."
1,I wanted to love it.,"I rarely leave reviews but feel that I need to for this product. It just arrived in the mail and my dog has been playing with it for about 15 minutes. Initially, it was great. It was perfect to throw and she was having a blast chasing it. I left her alone for about 10 and was just forced to put it away as there is now green rubber peices all over the floor. Given, my dog is definitely a chewer but I expected it to last longer than 15 minutes. Would not purchase again."
5,Great rubber stick,"This product is great! It is light weight and flexible enough to bend and give as the dog tugs, and if it's thrown, has enough heft to travel a distance but not so heavy as to hurt the dog if he happens to run ahead and get hit by it. Attractive colors as well."
2,Wimpy,"This ""ruff toy"" is not made for rough chewers. My english setter puppy demolished it quickly. It's too expensive for a toy this short-lived."
2,Certainly Not Indestructible,"This product is way overpriced. The picture seem to indicate three stick would be included in the order, but just one arrived. It is a light weight product that clearly can be destroyed by any determined dog."
2,Early shorts and it shows,"These 4 shorts together total under 1 hour. These are earlier shorts with poor video and sound quality, but may be interesting to watch for die-hard fans. Also note that there is VERY little in the way of singing or dancing in these videos."
5,The Little Princess,Great story about a little girlher dad is reported killed but she doesn't believe itand is reunited with her dad in the end .
5,5HP B&S Magneto for pre 1982 points Ignition.,"This part Fit perfectly, I installed it on a 70's vintage 5hp tiller, along with new points/plug, and a gasket set. It has a hot fire when installed correctly with new points/plug, and is just as reliable as the newer Magnetron systems. I pulled the plug wire to kill it, and it managed to throw arcs 1/2 inch to the plug and continued firing untill I got an insulated screwdriver to move the wire away from the plug."
3,A great summary of the original,"I originally found the Joy of Cooking in the public library, took it home and even though it wasn't specifically vegetarian I found most part of the book helpful as it gives detailed descriptions on how to properly cook almost everything. When I saw the vegetables section available on it's own I had to purchase it.I'm quite satisfied with this book, especially since it has photos. It's not as detailed as the original, but I still like the simplicity of the recipes and the writing style. Even though I've been vegetarian for some years now it's great to have a reference book that gives instructions on how to properly do things, such as roasting your own capsicum or making your own tomato sauce."
3,"Good Recipes, Fairly Complicated","This book is chock-full of really good vegetarian recipes. I've enjoyed everything I've made from this book. The downside is that many of the recipes tend to be a little complicated, or involve esoteric ingredients (which means I have to go out of my way to buy something I'll use maybe a few times a year).Since buying this book, I've learned a little more about what I like in cookbooks: I like recipes that let me use things I already have in my kitchen, or involve new additions that I can use in other dishes. I really want to expand my repertoire, but also don't want to clutter my (small) kitchen with little-used ingredients. This book isn't great for that.The recipes are, however, reasonably easy to follow, and everything tastes fantastic. There are also nice tips on basic cooking techniques, storage, etc."
3,Not For Me,"I am a long term vegetarian who bought a share in a local organic garden. I needed some info re: basic preperation of ordinary vegetables - ex. how long to cook cabbage, should eggplant be peeled before saute, how to cook beet greens and beets, what about turnips and greens? What this book provided was recipies to turn vegetables into fairly elaborate main course dishes. I guess the recipies were good, just not what I wanted."
3,It should be called Long Nights...,"Because that's how long it'll take a person to get into it! The author's dialogue is depleted after the first conversation...It's not very comlex, or inventive. I just hope that I don't sound like that when I talk! But it is very realistic, and if you like wineries, wine-making, and un-involving character situations, then you will enjoy it."
3,Good information about wine making!,"Gadol, Peter--The Long Rain--(Picador USA: New York, 1997)Lawyer Jason's Dark's life seemed to be falling into place after he reunited with his estranged wife Julie and son Tim and began to rebuild his family's vineyard. Then suddenly, while speeding through a California road late one rainy night, he struck and killed a teenage boy. He was aware of his need to report his accident to authorities. However, circumstances kept occurring which allowed him to make excuses to delay his confession.How Jason lived with this dark secret made for interesting reading, but the story took some unbelievable twists. The characters never seemed real to me. I was actually more interested in the story of Jason's vineyard than the story of his moral dilemma. I found the fact that a professional lawyer would be sharing his life story (albeit edited) with his incarcerated client both unethical and unlikely. As for the novel's end, it was preposterous!"
5,A book that keeps you wondering about character,"Gadol casts shadows over the main characters that are as pervasive as storm clouds: they can't get out from under the gloom of conscience, and readers can't easily answer the question: what if it were me? Like a modern-day Crime and Punishment, the deception get deeper and deeper. Gadol masterfully captures mood as he explores the essence of character. A great read and one that lingers..."
1,Blecch!,"This book was the worst. They could have edited out half of the book - it is mind-numbingly repetitive and utterly boring. Jason Dark is a loser. Do we really need a wine-making lesson - again and again and again. Hey! How about a fourth installment of 'punching down the cap'. The ending is utterly lame, they should have ended it right after Troy dies."
1,A Waste of Time,"Jason Dark is a completely dispicable character. Even if this situation were to happen to me and I were enough of a coward to cover it up, I sure don't want to read about someone else doing this. All Dark really had to lie about was how fast he was going. Wasn't it raining when he hit Craig Montoya? Couldn't he have said he lost it and hit the kid by accident, which is basically what happened? He clearly wasn't paying attention on CSI and NCIS, etc. His trail of evidence was overwhelming. I kept putting in tape after tape, all the while thinking, Isn't this over yet?!?? It wasn't that well written, either. Contrived and depressing. No thanks."
1,ABSOLUTELY ANNOYING!!!,"It was impossible for me to relate to the totally self-involved, objectionable subject of this book. I didn't like anything about him and only finished the book to hopefully get closure when he turned himself in. The book ran on and on and was incredibly repetitive to the point of nauseating. I resent having taken the time from my life that it took to read this horrible book!"
3,This was a Great Book,"Hi, I read the book called The Long Rain. This was a O.K. book. I honestly didn't like the book in the beginning. I didn't like it because the main character tried to hide the fact that he had taken a life of a young boy. He did this to try to protect a vineyard behind his house in the wine region state of California. He also tried to hide it because of his wife and child. I think that he should have just told the truth in the first place because he ended up trying to defend the man that the police had brought in for questioning. He was the only one that knows the truth about what actually happenend. To find out other things that happened, read this book."
2,they should call it Long Nights...,"Because that's what it will feel like to read! The dialogue is depleated after the first conversation between characters, and the wine-making repetition is rediculous! (to me)...But if you like wineries, wine-making, and a lesson on how to make a smashing cabernet, this is the book for you!"
4,Well written and absorbing book,"The Long Rain is slow to start and Gadol labours his love of vineyards and descriptions of wine making a little too much throughout. However, it is a thoroughly enjoyable read; with brilliant characterisation and an ability to toy with the readers emotions through Jason's moral dilemmas and choices. Perhaps there are too many twists and turns to make the story totally believable but it is a tale for our times with its insight into personal and professional failure."
3,This is a great book,"Hi, I read the book called The Long Rain. This was a O.K. book. I honestly didn't like the book in the beginning.

3,Just who are the reliables? Well I can tell you now....,"...that I bought the book. I wish I could have known before I bought it. But I collect books by the author so it's no real big disappointment to me, anyway this book covers 6 of what the author describes as dependable leading men. These stars could be counted on to give solid performances and not outshine their costars, these stars are1: Dana Andrews - the sober citizen type with an air of restrained heroism2: Wallace Beery - one of the most colorful actors in Hollywood3: Pat O'Brien - an easy-going, gentle but tough-looking Irish-American4: Walter Pidgeon -a virile, olympian type who projected mature authority5: Spencer Tracy - the actor's actor6: Robert Young - a bread-and-butter actor who could fit comfortably into almost any filmThis book contains a biography and filmography for each of the 6."
3,Amos forgets to keep it loose,"I have been a big fan and proponent of Lee's first release, but find this second effort a bit of a disappointment. Where the debut was fresh, this feels forced; in contrast to the effortless vocals of the first album Lee often seems to be straining to be heard over the compressed, iPod-ready production. The songwriting is a bit strained, as well, with frequent lapses into an earnest preachiness and cliche. If I'm going to go to a rootsy singer-songwriter for life advice or political perspective, I think I'll stick with Keb' Mo', who has mined this same territory with much better results recently.The disc does make something of a comeback in the last few tracks, beginning with ""Night Train"", a rather slight tune, but one that at least has some of the sense of ease and joy that Lee is capable of. I remain a fan and have high hopes for this guy's career; let's hope eventually we'll be able to look back on this disc as just a minor Sophomore slump."
5,Fabulous follow-up CD,"This CD is one I cannot stop listening to. This young man offers a variety of styles, moods, and tones -- all done with seeming ease and fluidity. His lyrics are meaniningful, the melodies catchy, and the arrangements effective. I count this CD among my very favorites."
3,"Good, calming music",You know a musician is good when they sound better live than they do on the album. I bought this after seeing Amos play 'Supply & Demand' on Carson Daily. I thought the live version was better but its still a great song and the album is pretty good too. I think I like his first one better though. Amos Lee has the sweetest honey voice.
3,Happy-go-lucky-ear-candy,"Not a bad sophmore follow-up to his first self-titled CD, but not as striking as the first. This is a fun CD...the kind you can put on and do something else (e.g. clean the house). I think that Amos Lee has more in him, as was hinted at with his first CD, but he needs help with songs that fit his talent."
4,Really Good Album,"I had never heard of Amos Lee but it was on the ""new releases"" shelf at B&N and I picked it up on the strength of the clips I could listen to in the store. Really good folksy rock tunes and strong vocals with a message. Reminds me of a young Bob Dylan with a much better voice."
3,Nice 2nd record ... but the law of the 2nd record strikes again!,"This CD is a nice effort, with some really good songs, and the same warm folk/blues/pop/ballad style that Amos seems to habit naturally. But IMHO it's not as good as his 1st record ... as it is often the case after such successful debuts.Nevertheless, I am fan of Amos and am looking forward to hearing more from him. This guy has a style and a voice."
5,Excellent CD,I have been a fan of Amos Lee for a few years now and I loved his first release and could not wait for the release of this CD and in typical Amos Lee fashion it was well worth the wait. Absolutely fantastic!!
3,Not as good as the first one...,"He seems to have lost the sweet edge he had with the first album. His voice has changed, seems a little more rough and ragged and these songs don't engage my interest nearly as much. This is still good but I don't play it nearly as often as his previous effort."
3,A Little 2 Much Country,"I loved Amos' first cd. I discovered him while planning a trip to Philly. One of those city websites had a link for his web page. I was able to listen to the tracks and was immediately enthralled. But ""Supply & Demand"" was a little too much country for me. If you like a little country twang mixed with some great background music, this is the cd for you. I still like the cd and its in regular rotation in my car."
3,A little disappointed,"These sheets looked great for the first use but after washing and drying them, they lost their shape. Really cheap stitching makes it hard to know which side is up or down. However, my teenage son doesn't even notice. He likes them and they complete the look he was going for in his room."
4,"Great idea, but missing something.....","Great idea for a book, however... sometimes I wonder about what photography schools are teaching people these days.... It seems like people get so caught up with the ""latest trick"" in photography(ie: computer manipulation...etc..) that it's hard to tell if what they are creating is from the heart. After looking through 25 and Under, I felt a lack of authentic expression. I would love to see another version of the book published with some representation of artists whom have not neccissarily attended the best photo schools in America."
1,"Catchy title, Silly idea!","I'm sure the editors and publishers of this book thought that this was such a unique idea for a photography book! Well, please let these young folks mature a bit and then see what kind of work they can be produced. What will they be doing at age 30? I'll bet most won't be photographers. For the most part there are few pleasant surprises and alot of perdictability. The sad truth is that there are many worthy photographers, with mature work, original ideas and a singular voice who will never have a book published. Why not ""25 and Up""!"
3,RECOMMENDED WITH RESERVATIONS,"Purchased this item approximately three weeks ago. The optical quality ranges from good to excellent. However, don't expect to get closeup views of Mars or for that matter Saturn even under the highest magnification. It gets high marks for terrestial viewing as well as closeup views of the Moon but does poorly in trying to align astronomical objects which I had to do manually. Contacted Meade they weren't much help. The dvd that came with it is OK for what its worth but I had to refer to it as well as the manual many times re: proper alignment, easy vieiwng and tonight's best. In the future, I will be seeking help from my local astronomy club to set me straight. Once this is taken care of I'm positive that my opinion of this scope will change for the better."
3,A lower than expected quality,"I recently bought a Meade ETX-80AT BB.But which part is the frustrating part.First, push the left and right arrow keys on the target. sometimes move by itself.Second, if matching the target in the center of the lens, flows in the direction of the right and bottom.Thirds, barlow and the eyepiece lens exchange, does not match the axis very accurately.finally, despite being brand-new, date and time had already been set.In other words, someone who works is estimated to be precipitated.Go find out if new suspicions.Mead's reputation than the expectation is less than the item.I have purchased with #3200 color filters set.MEADE filter set does not fit 26mm eyepiece exactly, but In 9.7mm fits.Filters can be mounted part is wrong."
2,Don't like lid,"This is a nice heavy glass dish, but it's terrible for cakes. The lid is not high enough and if you have a frosted cake, all the frosting sticks to the lid and makes a mess of your cake! It would be fine for other things, but if you want a cake pan like I did, you won't like this one!"
4,Sturdy,"I bought this pan from my local store. It is a well made piece, however, even though it says that the dish and lid are microwaveable, the lid shrank after I used it in the microwave. I guess it is safe, since it didn't break or melt. I wouldn't recommend using the lid inside of the microwave, but I would still recommend the dish for purchase."
2,Stick with instrumentals!,"What a disappointment this CD was!! I wish I had read all the other reviews before I ordered it. For a group of superbly talented musicians, this effort was definitely sub-standard. The lyrics on these songs were sophomoric, at best, as compared to their previous efforts. I look for more mature material in their next CDs. Don't get me wrong, I am a great admirer of these kids, and have seen them in concert numerous times. I just expect a lot more of them to earn my automatic purchase of their CDs."
2,Poor follow up,"I loved Nickle Creek's debut CD. This new one is a huge disappointment. What happened to the intstrumental virtuosity and songs like ""I am a Lighthouse""? This effort is sophmoric at best with some painfully, shrill vocal arrangements. There is very little violin on this CD which is very disappointing considering that Sarah is one of the best young fiddle players on the scene today. I appreciate ""taking a chance"" musically but this just didn't work for me. It was almost cartoonish at times. Nickle Crrek, go back and do what you do best! Instrumental virtuosity! Your songwriting skills will come in time but they are not refined enough to make up 90% of your music! 50% vocal/instrumental split is more like it for where you guys are now!Good Luck!"
1,this side,"a very disappointing followup to their debut cd. if you are a fan of bluegrass you will probably be very let down by this album. i was hoping for several instrumentals (there is only one which is ok but no where near as interesting as any of the instrumentals on their first cd)and more bluegrass like music. there is a lot of jazz, blues and rock influence on this cd which might be to your liking but if you are expecting more of the type of the music from the first cd i strongly urge you to listen to this cd before buying it. i have listened to it a few times and i doubt i'll be listening to it much more. their singing and playing is fine; it's just very pop sounding, something you'd expect to hear on mainstream radio with nothing original about it."
3,Disappointed,"I did not enjoy this album much. I like bluegrass and have heard alot of Nickel Creeks bluegrass that is great. I saw them on Tv during the holidays singing Bring a torch Jeannette Isabella that was super great. I wish they would record that! Anyway, this one is different and not my cup of tea."
