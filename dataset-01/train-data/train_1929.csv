5,"An Undiscovered Classic, becoming a cult favorite.","After several of my friends hyping this book, I figured it would probably be just another flash in the pan mini-craze: a book for those who loved to love books and movies that nobody else had heard about. Only it turns out that Legend is actually a great book, every bit as good as the culties claim it is."
3,80s Post nuclear holocaust-style adventure,"Sure, this book was hard to put down, but I couldn't figure out why it was labeled science fiction. There are no new technologies, the technology in the book is just electricity, and isn't even the biggest influence in the book. It is a crime to charge nearly 20 bucks for a book that is so poorly laid out in text, and has such a poor resolution graphic cover. Nevertheless, the story is worth reading if you can find a used copy. It's hard to put down, but it's only a quick 300-page read, with just about every moral spelled out for you."
5,A FIRST RATE END OF THE WORLD THRILLER!,"From the article I read, this book has been around since the mid 80s and is only now beginning to catch on. After reading the book, I can only wonder why it took so long.It's an unusually structured story. The hero and the heroine virtually never meet until the end of the book. For most of the story they are in different, though related worlds. Each is in fact living in the other's world, and each is struggling to survive. When they come together one of those worlds dies and the other is changed forever.A great read."
5,A bible for the New Age and a joy to read.,There are people who are claiming this book is divinely inspired. Which of course it isn't. No divinely inspired book would be this much fun to read. I heartly recommend it.
5,THE JOURNEY OF A LIFETIME!!!!,"A trip to two amazingly detailed worlds in the company of some of the most interesting characters you've ever spent time with. And the outcome you will not believe. This would make a tremendous movie, maybe even a mini-series."
5,Exciting and thought provoking,"Like all good fiction, this is a book that really makes you think. Part of you wants to put it down to think out some idea the story raises but the story itself keeps you turning the pages. I recommend it. Highly."
4,A pretty darn good book,"Not an all time great, but very entertaining and much better on the inside than on the outside, of course with an outside cover like this one anything would be better on the inside."
5,Mmmm...,"I haven't read this book, so ignore the number of stars, but looking at the reviews there seems to be ONE person writing most of the reviews for this book. Watch out..."
5,Mr Ball's book really got me rolling,"I've been in the workforce for almost twenty years, and am only now going back to college, but I felt like this book was written just for me. It talks about direction, and uses words we don't see enough of - like Passion, and Value. After working in customer service for so long, every word he said rang true. It is obvious he has studied many succesful people (from the quotes and anecdotes he sprinkles throughout the book) and is trying to pass on what he has learned from them while emphasizing that most important third dimension of work - satisfaction. (The first and second being Money and a Benefit Package *wink*)While the theme is a serious one, the book is a great read. Michael's style makes you feel like he's right there in the room telling his jokes in person. The intimacy really worked for me. I'm glad I picked this up - I might even change my major!"
4,trailer light replacement,Bought to replace curb side light on my boat trailer. The bolt holes lined up almost perfect. The step on cover didn't fit right but I don't us the steps anyway. Wiring worked perfect. Easily half the price of the original light. I'd say go for it.
1,"crummy product, avoid if possible","This taillight is NOT ""waterproof"". Not even close.As you go into the interior anatomy of this light, beneath the transparent reflective red outer plastic part is a white bubble-like housing for the lamps. The problem was (after less than a month of ownership) the lights were so rusted from water damage, that the bulb could not be exchanged. Had to throw the whole thing away. Sand, debris, and water were all found inside of the clear plastic housing.Both the left and the right tail lights were equally inoperable and equally damaged.I would spend the extra money to get the LED lights because they seem to be sealed better."
1,EEEEEEKKKK!!!,"Crud dude, i helluv bought dis dvd plannin on learnin some hip new mooves to dance to at prom. But this was crayzy! i dunno how anyone could learn to dis. cmon now. It's not like any other hip hop ive seen. Maybe dis is outdated or sumthin, but i reccomend not buyin it, bcuz you won't be koo wit these moves."
5,A delightful book of letters covering 20 years of friendship,"An engaging work of non-fiction, Hanff relates her 20 year relationship with a London bookseller via the postal service, Starting in 1949, not long after the war when shortages in England were plentiful. Miss Hanff, a writer of TV scripts, writes her first letter to Marks & Company Booksellers in search of rare books. It is the beginning of a long relationship that encompasses not only the man in charge of her account, Frank Doel, but the many workers at the company who come to love her teasing and sometimes biting letters, always followed by packages of powdered eggs and tins of meat during a time when meat is a scarcity. Her sarcastic nature comes across pleasantly as they banter across the ocean, she in New York and he in London.This was a sweet compilation from a period in time that is not to be forgotten, brought to you with the personal whimsical taste of a woman who shared the love of a good book. Kelsana 6/24/02"
3,Boring,This book was ok. I would not read it again. It was just ordinary. I was glad to be done with it.
3,Superficial delight,"Charming story. If you love books and are nostalgic of a world where human relationships could be built over traditional mail,...go for it"
3,"84, Charing Cross Road",Interesting book that proves friendship can be created and sustained by people that haven't met.
5,Heartwarming!,This delightful book was recommended to me by a friend. I was working in a library at the time and found it and read it only to want to read more by the author which I did. My daughter was living in London at the time I read it and I was so anxious for her to go and find the old bookstore which she never did.I can only imagine how wonderful it was for Frank and Helen to have one another to write to all those years-so very romantic. I highly recommend this to anyone who is a romantic!
5,I love this story.,"And I don't know why. It prompted me to read everything else I could find by Hanff and loved them all. She has captured a New York City I wish I had felt at home in, one that I went looking for but never found because I was too late. Hanff was the feisty type of woman I always find amazing, demanding and persnickety but with a heart like gold--very much like true New Yorkers. All of her books make me want to hug them, keep them real close to my heart. Wish I could thank the lady for giving them to me."
5,The best book I have read in years,"Charming. Moving. Amazing. This is one of the best books I have read in years. Brought tears of joy to my eyes more than once as I read it (on the plane). Its a quick read, but captivating and fun. Humerous, lovable, interesting and a wonderful reflection on human nature, how different people see things differently, how different people 'connect' with different things and people....Great book."
3,Book-buying in pre-Amazon days,"Quite an interesting little (96 page) read, starting in 1949 with the author's first letter to a London antiquarian bookseller. From the very first, her personality shines out in her informal writing style. Meanwhile Marks & Co respond in more business-like terms.Gradually the formality breaks down. Ms Hanff takes the initiative when she begins a letter 'Sir (It feels witless to keep writing ""Gentlemen"" when the same solitary soul is obviously taking care of everything for me)' and concludes 'I'm sending it c/o you, FPD, whoever you are.'FPD identifies himself as Frank Doel; Ms Hanff sends the team a Christmas hamper; junior staff members write to thank her; they exchange details on their respective lives and Ms Hanff writes about the books she's reading. 20 years roll by..."
5,A gem to be admired!,"Do you love books? Books about books? Bookshops? Read this. It's a wonderful gem I'm glad I stumbled upon. Done in epistolary format, it showcases a delightful friendship over the years. Humor, kindness, life, and books. Trust me, try it.Also, I wish books still were this inexpensive..."
4,Charming,"A charming, quick read that will delight anyone with a love of books. The relationships that develop and the intertwined historical setting just add to the story."
2,Charring Cross,The book was delightful. The copy was old which gave me the feeling that I was reading the book when it was written. I'll pass it on to another book-lover friend.
3,"I'll go against the current, here...","Yes, this book is mostly charming, but somehow I was left with the feeling that by publishing those letters, the author was cashing in while patting herself in the back : ""Look how witty and generous I am/was...""This is also a VERY slim book, with, obviously, many letters missing from the actual correspondance (we get answers to unseen requests and questions).So, overall, I was left with the feeling that I was not getting my money's worth, with the Paperback - 128 pages Reissue edition (September 27, 1990) at 14.00$."
5,84 charing Cross Road,fast delivery and merchandise in very good condition. 84 Charing Cross Raod. Wonderful book that I read over 20 years ago and loved it all over again.
1,The typing of the shrew.,"I saw the movie, and while I didn't love it, it was interesting enough for me to try the book. Big mistake. It's like peeking at the diary of a cloying, annoying, lonely woman. At times I felt sorry for her, but mostly just angry at myself for spending the money to get the book.The only amazing thing about this book, is how many people love it."
5,HIGHLY RECOMMEND,"This book is one of the few books in the dream interpretation section of the bookstore that is of any worth. I've read Freud, Jung, and many other greats in this field and I would say that the author does justice to the subject. I also liked the length of the book. He doesn't ramble on about technical gargage; he is very to the point. This book showed me that I have more potential than I thought, even at my age. The things he says make a lot of sense and I would honestly recommend this book to anyone regardless of age. This book ranks as one of my personal all time favorites because it is honest and not at all candy coated. The book also doesn't chose to define things that appear in dreams as having only one definition, indeed they have many. In short, this book is a good investment for anyone interested in learning about themselves and their dreams. The price is also very fair when compared to other authors who like to charge in the upper teens to twenty or so dollars."
1,Yuck,"I understand Mr. Belcher is coming out with a second book soon. God help us. If it's as bad as this one it's sure to get more bad reviews like this. Unless of course he writes his own reviews which is the way it seems to be on this site. I had a dream the other night. I dreamt that a angel came to me and said ""You get what you give"" . That dream could mean anything. But I'm sure Mr. Belcher has a set standard for what each dream means. People are individuals. Each dream is different for each person. There is no one dream fits all catagory. This book is horrible."
5,Great book!,I loved the incite. He has a very interesting philosophy on life. I highly reccommend this book.
1,WARNING: DO NOT EVEN CONSIDER BUYING THIS BOOK!,"I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH AGAINST THIS BOOKLET MASQUERADING AS A BOOK, BECAUSE A PREVIOUS REVIEWER (PRISCILLA FROM LUBBOCK TX) HAS ALREADY SAID IT ALL! I SHOULD HAVE LISTENED TO HER INSTEAD OF THE OTHER 19 REVIEWERS WHO RAVED ABOUT THIS BOOKLET AND GAVE IT 5 STARS! 5 STARS????? WHY? THE AUTHOR DOES NOT EVEN SOUND LIKE HE HAS IT TOGETHER MENTALLY AND, WHAT'S UP WITH THE PUBLISHER? DON'T THEY EMPLOY ANY PROOFREADERS? IT REALLY DESERVES 0 STARS. PLEASE SAVE YOUR $$."
1,WARNING! See this book before you buy it![.],"I bought this book based on recommendations and reviews--never again!! The huge font and triple spacing were obviously machination to make this a full-length book; typed in a normal format it could not fill more than 20-30 pages. The misuse of words, the egregious syntax, the misspellings, the unbelievable grammar and punctuation errors are astonishing. I could find no deep thoughts or original philosophies here--only a vanity publication. I can't believe I spent [$$]for this! What a rip-off!"
2,Mediocre,"First off, It's more like a flyer than a book because it's so short. Second, That is actually a good thing because I have never read so much phooey. When it comes to symbolism Freud said, ""A Cigar is sometimes just a cigar"". Same with dreams. Sometimes a dream is just a dream. This author puts his own labels and biased opinions onto what he thinks certain dreams mean and he states it as though it's all fact. And he does it in a boring dogmatic fashion. I don't have to always agree with a book as long as the book is somewhat interesting or entertaining. This book is dull and tedious."
5,Simple and Profound,"This book is short and sweet, simple but very profound. Anyone in a leadership position would benefit from reading this and acting upon Dr. Green's principles."
5,Tons of pictures,"Nice book for anyone interested in VW history (especially the VW bus). Text is sometimes short, but the pictures make up for the lack of detail in the text. Nevertheless, this book is excellent."
4,xentrix kills ......,"great band with great skill. the guitar work is fantastic and the music is fast ...... has an early testament feel to it musically at some points and vocally , but not without taking away any of their own individual sound ............. the Ghostbusters song is just an awesome jam to hear"
1,Judge by its cover?,"I cannot help but think, if the producers were so careless as to use an image of WWII german tanks on the cover of this WWI DVD, how careless were they with the rest of the product?"
4,"OK, it's only a basting brush.....","But this is a simple kitchen addition that does it's job perfectly! The bristles hold even thin sauces and juices to baste easily and the plastic collar keeps the bristles off of the counter to keep them clean. The silicone also washes clean and does not hold flavors or stains. I should give it 5 stars, but come on, it's only a basting brush."
3,"Not as good as expected, Very hard",I buy all of the Laffy Taffy flavor's in these buckets. This one was hard as a rock. The shipment I received must be out dated but I can not tell with the code what the date is. It is very hard to chew and I am used to freezing them to get them hard. Taste wise there OK but Banana is my favorite.
4,Australia's Heart,"Di Morrisey certainly paints a wonderful picture of the Australian Outback. The reader can almost touch the harsh, but spectacular landscape. The introduction of the various aborigine characters is managed by describing them truthfully but sesitively."
5,Excellent read,"I thoroughly enjoyed Kimberley Sun as a sequel to Tear of the Moon which I also loved. Di Morrissey has a literary style which is easy to read but at the same time gives you lots of great factual information. Its easy to relate to the characters who are so ""real"". I also found myself wanting to return to Broome and the Kimberley region to revisit many of the places she talks about. Thank you for another great read."
4,Kimberly Sun,I know the area very well this book is set in and the writer paints an accurate portrait. The story was very interesting and easy to follow. I would recommend this book to people wanting to know more of the Kimberley region and the laid-back life-style written about in this book is actually 'a fact'!!.
3,magically 80's!,"While the boys of the 80's had Michael J. Fox as the ""Teen Wolf"", girls were well-catered for too, with Robyn Lively as TEEN WITCH. For a fun flashback to the era of leg-warmers, frizzy perms and stonewash jeans, TEEN WITCH is a great film.Louise Miller (Robyn Lively) is the school dork, until she inherits magical powers on her 16th birthday. Almost immediately Louise transforms from wallflower to wonder-witch, and nothing, it seems, is impossible...not even the love of the highschool football hero (Dan Gauthier).Zelda Rubinstein, Marcia Wallace, Shelley Berman and Dick Sargent (from ""Bewitched"") are all fabulous. Robyn Lively is an appealing presence in the lead role. The DVD includes both widescreen and full-frame versions of the movie.TECHNICAL DETAILS:Aspect ratio: 1:85:1 (anamorphic widescreen), 1:37:1 (fullscreen)Double-sided, single-layer discKeep caseAudio : English (stereo surround)Subtitles: English, French, Spanish"
4,"Was a gift, and am quite happy with the item","I think the packaging could have been better, as in the cover of the dvd was quite soft and was not a very sturdy, strong dvd cover like I have recieved in the past.Other than that the person that received the dvd, was very happy!!!"
1,Teen Witch Is Bad,"I thought this movies was low quality, and the clothes are horrible! I think to sum it up, it was quite a cheesy movie."
3,The Best Guilty Pleasure Ever,"This movie is ridiculous, it has the usual eighties teen movie stereotypes, the plot sucks...and i can't watch it enough times. Top that!"
5,Great Movie!!,"I really enjoy this movie. I remember watching this movie on t.v. just a few years ago and I couldn't wait for it to come out on DVD. I am so glad that I bought this movie, because now I can watch it over and over again. I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys happy endings."
4,Forgot how great this film was!,"Feel good film from my childhood, my sister who is 12 years younger loved it. She is 17, and she identified well with the main character"
4,"""Teen Witch""",It was a delightful movie to watch and tape once again when I had taped over it by accident. The plot and moral of the story are good ones and deserve a first class rate. The reason why I rated it 4 stars is because the best friend of the main character was not of what I had expected. I was thinking that she could have been prettier and more supportive.
5,Greatest movie of my childhood,"I remember watching this movie countless times as a child and would love to see it again. Unfortunately because it isn't being released again, I can't ever watch it and enjoy the romance and comedy. I would love to see it re-released and I know for a fact that millions feel the same way."
5,Finally!!!!!!!!,"Finally heh,I Don't believe it,And I didn't think TEEN WITCH Would be on DVD..Thanks ,I'm The 80's Romantic/Comedy's lover,I've got lotsa 'em on LASERDISCs 'nd DVDs And I've waitin to get TEEN WITCH on DVD for years,shhh I'm gonna buy two dvd Copies like I did with MISCHIEF,This Movie Rock yer House :)"
3,cute but not the best wich movie,"this movie is pretty good but i've seen better witch moves. The best part is when louise fianally figures out that she can win over the hot guy with her confidents and charm instead of using spells to get him to like her. That last scene was probably inspired by dirty dancing but the routine was not nearly as good. This is actually pretty cheesy but fun to watch every once and while. If you want a good witch movie i reccomend ""the witches"" with anjelica houston"
4,Teen Witch...a cute movie.,I have liked this movie since I was a young teenager...and I still like it.
5,One of the best 1980's movies...,"I really love this movie. This is one of those classic movies that children of the 80's know and love. I love the song and dance sequences. Just looking at the characters' hair and clothes is enough to give anyone a retro flashback. The soundtrack is a lot of fun too. I recommend this movie to everyone.I only wish that there had been a realese without subtitles, but I still recommend the movie. We may not get another shot at owning this one. It seems to be one of those classics that gets forgotten. A+"
5,Teen Witch - great movie,"It took me forever to find the name of this movie, a lot of google searching and 80's movie site browsing. But once I got the name of it I was off and racing to buy it. And it was a great watch. Every girls dream to be beautiful and popular and get the great guy. To get back at your annoying brother and those nasty girls at school. Classic story line, and with this movie you've got the added fun of the 'magic' factor. And of course the moral lessons come along for the ride. A great fun movie to watch and be entertained. Takes you back if u grew up with this movie and that's fun too. Very recommended as a classic 80's movie to watch."
3,Young and Hopeless?,"The movie, ""Teen Witch"" is about a girl who is a witch in school. It is about her trying to ge a boy to like her!"
1,Looking for a terrible movie??? YOU FOUND IT!!!,"From the horrible special effects to the embarassing dance around the car scenes, this flick makes for a perfectly good waste of time! It's a must see for all 80's lovers out there! Go to it guys!"
3,Cheesy 80s teen movie at it's best,"This movie is the epitome of 80s teen drama (next to The Breakfest Club), with a wonderful twist, she's a witch! Louise goes from frumpy, unpopular and unnoticed to the most noticed girl in school. She uses her powers to gain the affection of the school's most popular boy and wins his heart.. with a spell! The movie is filled with great songs that make you want to dance. Great songs meaning cheesy pop from the 80s, of course. If you've yet to see this movie, take the plunge and enjoy a great film that makes you laugh and sigh at these kids antics the whole way through. It's also a good movie for the family(except for one scene that is suggestive, but it is no worse on what is on tv today). Teen Witch is probably one of the most underrated movies of all time, but to this writer it is one of the most loved of all time."
5,A true 80's movie!,"If you love 80's movies, then this one's the one! Legwarmers, crimped hair and jean jackets included! It's such a uplifting and spontaneous movie that you can't help but love it. And Louise's Brad is so hunky! Richy's voice might be a little annoying and Serena may squeak a little but all the quirky songs and dance numbers in the movie more than make up for it. If you want a fun and crazy 80's movie, don't miss out on Teen Witch!"
3,Teen Witch,"I used to always watch this movie when I was a kid, and I recently bought the DVD and watched it again. It was corny and all that, but I still loved it! Brad (Dan Gauthier) is still really cute and Louise (Robyn Lively) is a good enough actress.. Beware of the all the 80s clothes/music though!"
4,great for the imagination!,This movie is a cheesy kind of cute! My sister and I must have watched this movie a thousand times when we were growing up!
5,Sweet 80's Movie,"I just love this movie! It's about an insecure, unpopular, nice girl who becomes a witch on her 16th birthday. Will she use her powers for good or evil? Will everything she sets in motion end up the way she planned? You'll just have to watch and see. Yes, it has some 80's cheese factor, but that's part of why it's so great!"
4,Singing Ellis,"She glistens with the excited fervor that musicians exude when they tell a story of their latest inspirations. Ms. B. is no different when she rocks back and forth at the mic pouring out the experience of a young woman learning to enjoy the moment.She is alive in this moment, sharing her views of freedom post 9.11, of the love that ""got away"" or did it?, of the process of living right now.Her guitar playing is impressive and fun. Her demeanor is gracious and inviting...kinda like she just rolled out the rug for your company and she has a tune she can play for you.Listen, then go see her perform. She has an infectious stage personality. It's good for us working stiffs to see someone doing what they love, someone filled with the light of their craft..."
2,flimsy,"This product is flimsy, and the visor too narrow to block the sun efficiently. I am a breast cancer survivor and had a real interest in promoting awareness, but I do not intend to wear this."
4,Slik Monopod All I Expected,"Yes, it's lightweight--not very suitable for the larger or heavier cameras, but entirely satisfactory for the many < 2-pound smaller cameras. The integral tilt head is a great touch, and avoids another purchase of a separate head. The smallest leg section is a bit light and flimsy, but I think other users have also found that it is entirely useable when not completely extended."
5,Makes me want to dance everytime I hear it!,"I heard this band live, and I was blown away. I had to go right out and get the CD. Listen to Gino Goes Wild, and Hit Me With A Hot Dog are fabulous. The kind of songs that you sing all day. Highly recommended!"
5,They're swing with an attitude,"If you're looking for a sweet, happy sounding, formula band, keep looking because Set 'Em Up Joe ain't it. Instead, they're a gritty 5-piece band that's got attitude and bite and know how to weave it all together into a 12 song package that's sure to leave your senses buzzing.As the other two reviews below wrote, their live shows are quite a treat and should not be missed. They've got a good stage presence and have a wonderful habit of talking *with* the audience and not just *to* the audience."
3,not what I thought it would be,This is a good book for a elementary student with good information about each of the presidents. I felt it was an easy read but was looking for something more.
2,A Cartoon Version of the Presidents for Kids - not Adults,"My mistake in ordering this - I mistakenly thought it was the adult book version, not the kid's cartoon version. Make sure you are ordering the correct book when you order. This is much too simplistic for my educational needs. I will give it as a gift to one of my nieces or nephews. I can see where this would be a fun introduction of the Presidents to younger folk, but for adults? Nope.kone"
4,A very entertaining overview of the Presidents,"Full of fun facts and humorous illustrations, this is an excellent introduction to the Presidents as well as a useful review tool for those of us who, ahem, already learned this stuff. I used it to get ready for a Jeopardy! appearance, and it served me well. I also recommend it as a helpful supplement to younger students as a painless way to fix each President firmly into place!"
5,This is not PG rated,"We might be living in a PG era in WWE, but nothing kid friendly about this DVD. Jake talks about, watching his father wrestle battling drugs and alcohol addictions, nearly ending his life, a controversial feud with Jerry Lawler where his personal demons become part of the storyline. For any old school WWF fan I recommend this DVD."
4,Great dvd,"At first I wasn't going to buy this dvd. I didn't really care or know a whole lot about the career of Jack Roberts. Then I saw it Used at a local Game Stop store. For $11 I couldn't refuse. The doc. is GREAT, I knew that he does or did drugs, I learned alot about the Man and his hard up bringing. As for the extras there are tons I found three or four hiddden easter eggs. If you can find this Used BUY IT."
3,Jake The Snake,If this is the match listings I don't know if I'll buy it. Where is the fueds with Randy Savage and Andre The Giant? Seems like they are leaving out quite a bit of his great matches and fueds.
2,"The bad side will be beter then the good side, Sorry but it's true.","I was never high on Jake ""The Snake"" his matches were very boring. When ever he fought a guy it was more about the otherWrestlers fear of Snakes. But his real life dark story is real interesting. That's worth watching. But I can't think of one solid match he had."
2,Tripod good but the quick adapter is horrible,The Slik tripod is a very good unit but the quick adapter is bad. I have one of the older units and bought a couple of new Quick Shoes. After receiving them I tried them out and could not lock the camera in the tripod head. Had to take and machine the Quick Shoe to create the friction fit required to lock the camera to the tripod. Switched to a Manfrotto head and adapter plates -- so much better.
5,Serves my needs,I purchased a used tripod with this quick post missing. Ordered one and it works great. Helped me in making a 180 degree landscape photo.
5,U212DX post Review,"The part I received was the manufacturers original part, not a 3rd party item, as is so many cases, for which I am very satisfied."
5,Exactly What You Expect,"What can I say? It does what it's supposed to do and it feels sturdy to boot. If you have a Slik tripod, you don't have any choice, but this quick shoe is great anyway."
2,Slick Quick Release,"Slick makes a great tripod. This quick release mechanism is horrible, horrible, horrible.Put a Manfrotto head on the Slick tripod and you have a good combination."
4,a good low energy replacement,"I don't think it's brighter, but it's a good replacement as it uses less power for the same brightness. So for emergencies when you are out of power the led will last a long time but doesn't provide more light than the original bulb from maglite."
3,New life for an old flashlight?,Bought this for my 25 year old 4 cell Maglight. After using some of the newer LED flashlights I was hoping to get a really kick butt LED flashlight. Sorry to say but this wasn't much of an upgrade. Light output is whiter but no greater than the standard bulb. Wish I had those few bucks back. Maglight really needs to get on the ball with LED technology that is out there today. I have several flashlights that are a fraction of the size of a 4 cell maglight that just blows this big dinosaur away. It is a tough old light though!
4,Works as advertised - but be aware....,"The product works as advertised. Be aware that the SLIK 700DX tripod comes equipped with one as part of the package. That fact was not clear in the description of the tripod. I got sucked into buying another quick release plate. A second one is fine if you have more than one camera, if not, you got yourself something you may well not need and for a rather spendy price."
2,Poor Mounting Plate Design,"The quality of my Slik 700DX is good. However the mounting plate is poorly designed.Easy to screw in unit makes camera rotation easy when you turn cam on it's side, it doesn't hold the cam steady (D700w24/70)A separate screw to get friction on the cork base might have been a better design"
5,Slik Quick Release Plate,"excellent product very convenient to handle the camera withuot risk ,very fast operation good design ,metalic robust construction apear to be a lasting product"
1,does not fit,This is a large waste of money. It does not fit and without major modifications there is no way to make it fit. It is incompatible with the built in racks. Waste of money
3,An interesting early work of L'Engle,"I really enjoy L'Engle and this was one of the few works of hers that I had not yet read. It was an interesting book and the movement between plot story lines kept me engaged. However, I wouldn't say that I truly ""enjoyed"" it, perhaps because there weren't any characters that I truly liked. Emily, the protagonist, is an interesting character, but struck me as immature and selfish. She also doesn't seem to really grow and develop through the book the way that other L'Engle protagonists do. I did enjoy the glimpse into the life of Mimi and Virginia as adolescents, but I appreciate the deeper character development of L'Engle's later works."
5,The poetics of winter,"I love the way this novel brings the experience of living in deep cold in the French alps vividly alive. This is one of L'Engle's adult novels but it is very similar to her realistic novels for adolescents, although with a bit more sexual explicitness. It is set just after WWII (the landlady is a former collaborator who got away with it). It explores the complexity of human interrelationships with characteristic L'Engle depth and subtlty."
2,Not a real DVD,Tried playing it on my DVD player and it froze. This is basically a CD not a DVD; it only worked on the laptop. And I did not read anywhere in the amazon description that I was to be buying a multiple-dancer routine. I thought I could just learn it as one dancer.
3,"Choose Retromedia, Not Alpha","If you're a fan of this cult masterpiece of the bizarre, buy the Retromedia DVD, not the Alpha DVD. While the Retromedia copy is far from the quality this movie deserves, it's widescreen and has marginally better color and a considerably crisper image. It also has a bonus interview with the star, Gordon Mitchell."
1,Shoddy Copy,"The DVD is not in the widescreen format, which results in distorted images. The fun of seeing these foreign imports is subsequently lost."
4,for critic from Canada,"While I appreciate Mr. Trpceski CD and while I think he is a WONDERFUL pianist please listen to the recording of M.Pletnev playing his own transcription of Tchaikovsky and to S. Richter's recording of Prokofiev's Sixth!! Please do NOT compare apples and oranges. People might really think that Mr. Kissin is as 'legendary' as Mr. S.Richter, which is simple nonsense! There is Moon to Earth distance between these two as well as there is even a further distance between Mr. Trpceski and Mr. PletnevIf, after listening to Mr. Pletnev and Mr. Richter, you still have tears when hearing Mr. Trpceski's Tchaikovsky you have to talk to your doctor....may be he/she can help you.Good luck!"
5,I loved it!,I grew up hearing stories of my grandfather being an Italian officer prisoner of war in Missouri. Now I understand why he always spoke about the USA with affection. This book allowed to find the historical details of his life after he was capture in north Africa. The most moving thing was seeing him in a group picture with other prisoners. Thanks to the author to bring information to an almost unknown part of my family history.
4,Double Crossing,"I really enjoyed Double Crossing. I kept thinking of my own grandmother's journey to America. I know very little about her experience, but I think they came from approximately the same area and were close to the same age. I was impressed by Eve Tal's story telling skills--I felt I was there, witnessing a part of my history that was lost. The story renewed my awe and respect for the courage of our ancestors in leaving everything they knew to face an unknown country--and the pain of leaving their loved ones behind, unable to communicate with them for long periods of time."
5,A mind-blowing book!,"Personally I am not a regular science fiction reader -- I had heard good reviews about Noon's Automated Alice, and while on the prowl for it at a local library, I ran into Vurt instead. The story sucked me in right off the bat, and I finished it in three days. Noon creates another world entirely without having to bring about drastic changes between real-life Manchester and his of 1998. The differences are subtle, but enough to paint an entirely different portrait -- the characters and memorable and likeable, despite various unusual and often taboo quirks he gave them. I can't completely explain why I liked this book so much. Noon's voice for the narrator and lead character Scribble was one that the reader felt empathy for; the situations and feathers were painted with such detail that they were impossible not to picture. Best of all, when I was done, I thought about the book for days. A definate must read -- you have to read it to even brush getting the gist of it."
3,Something of a non-entity of a book.,"In many ways, science-fiction is the hardest of all the fictions to write well, because you really must create a believable world, and unfortunately, Vurt does not do this. Vurt is somewhat slow and at times dull, with the occosional bizarre use of E.E Cummings style word layout proving only an irritation, leaving no real impression after reading, which, if anything, is the true sign of a book failing"
2,Don't waste your time,"Don't let these good reviews fool you, this book plain sux. The dialogue is moronic, the characters are totally inconsistent, and the plot is so disjointed at times I had to wonder if this was a collection of short stories. This book tries so hard to be hip and edgy, but fails in a very annoying way. If you like the Alice-in-wonderland vurt world theme then I recommend you pick up The Diamond Age by Neil Stephenson."
1,vurt..yawn,"I would really love to find some cool sci fi....I thought Vert might be that.....Having read half the book I don't get the hype. It seems to me to be a yet another tale of urban dacay set in some miserable city in Britain in the not very far away sometime, staring your regular crusties ,who have fights with bady crusties ,who need their drug fix, and who don't like cops. To make it sci fi, the drug fix of the minute is some alien thing that seems to make you trip(generally a bad trip it seems, which strangely is addictive) but except its more than tripping ,the experience is kind of a blurred virtual reality thing, ...er cause this is a science fiction book so must have the obligatry cyber reference I guess. Gee really original huh .amazing."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"Vurt is just not very good. When you look at what William Gibson, Pat Cadigan, Walter Jon Williams and others have done with this sort of thing, or even going back further, this is very disappointing.Alternate reality via drugs and all is perhaps missing the point at little, at this point. Plenty of other cyberpunk tales to read before you need to waste your time with this one."
5,amazing wonderful story,This is one of my favourite books. It has so many wonderful ideas and created such wonderful pictures that I can't believe there has not been a movie made from it. I have reread it a few times and enjoy it each time. It was the first Jeff Noon book that I ever read and I went on to read all of them. Vurt is still my favourite though.
3,"Interesting stuff, but nothing brilliant","This is pretty familiar ground for cyberpunk enthusiasts, seen through a different character, with a little mixed-up Orpheus myth tossed in and with the science not quite so well explained. As near as I can figure out, the ""Vurt"" is a nanotechnological drug. Read the book, what I say will make more sense.It's interesting, certainly, but there's really not much of a point to it other than having fun, being a good ride. I plowed through 220 pages of this waiting for an on a train, that's how fast it can go.It is a fun read, but it doesn't really tell us anything, nothing like Gibson's future near-noir or Stephenson's hysterical glancing at humanity. A book for the beach, I enjoyed it."
1,(cyberpunk) + (beat) = conventional poo,"This book was recommended to me, heightening my disappointment. Yet further proof why I must trust no one. I guess even cyberpunk has its own set of cliches. Read this book and fly into every one of them. So Noon read Shampoo Planet et al,...Kool-Aid Acid Test, and digs Burroughs, etc. What you get is an unimaginative, recycled verbal montage of quirky characterizations, boring drug experiences, and an ill-conceived plot--all from someone who's never lived the dream. Yawn. For every Samuel Coolridge and William Gibson, there are approx. 3,582 Jeff Noons."
1,"Derivative, uninteresting, and annoyingly nonsensical",What cyberpunk looks like when it's jumped the shark. So stupid and bad that whenever I picked it up it put me in an irritable mood.I'm not likely to waste more time on any other books by Noon.
5,Curious Yellow,"Yay for Jeff Noon. This is a fantastic book,he writes fantastically in a style of his own. If you have not read any Jeff Noon then do so forthwith"
4,Whatever This Was It Was Good!,"I'm still not sure exactly what this was but maybe that's half the fun. Far future? Near future? Present day? I don't know and it doesn't really matter. This is one wild book, so energetic that turing the last page and finishing the book is remarkably like getting off of a rollercoaster. Not classic literature that will be forever remembered but a great deal of fun."
4,This is a fun book.,"First off, let me say that I love it when a bunch of failed authors write reviews to show how much they know about the writing that they themselves are unalbe to do. Is this Joyce or Dostoevski, No. Is it Dick, a little. Is it a bit rehased, yes. But here's the big point. Who cares. It's a fun book to read. Cool story, cool characters, fun little twists, that's all I really want in a book, especially a SF one. It's not like I'm looking for god in these pages, just a good read, that's all. And this book is a good read. So there."
4,My personal Opinion,"I am not one to enjoy science future fiction, but seeing that Jeff Noon is a well known British author I thought perhaps I might give it a try. ""Vurt"" is wonderfully written with a slow start but a fast pacing climax all the way throughout the book. I was very impressed with Jeff Noon's ability to capture jealousy, anger and fear within the characters. This is partly the reason that I staid with the book until it's end."
5,An outstanding debut,"Remarkable. Noon blows the doors off of the stagnatinggenre of science-fiction with this debut. It containsthe familiar elements of a cyberpunk novel, but Noon createshis prose with fuzzy hallucinogenic halos and psychedelic colours(oh that Curious Yellow!). Kind of like William Gibson on acid.Noon doesn't just break the rules, he pulverizes them, establishinghimself as one of the most brilliant young writers to hit the sf scenein a long time."
4,Cheap plastic case,"Clear plastic cover was broken and useless. Tray was still useable. Tools are what they are, useless when you don't need them. I needed these! Well, one of the bits anyway. At $16.00 you can't go too wrong."
1,No good,"I bought this bone at Petco to help my pup keep cool on hot days. Not only did she chew a hole in it in the first few minutes, but it thaws out very fast and is just a soggy dog toy. Because it doesn't stay frozen long in 80 degree weather, it is easier to chew and tear holes in. I am just glad I bought it at half price and didn't waste a ton of money on it.If you are looking for something cool for your pup you are better off giving it an Ice Cube"
3,Good product as long as it's frozen!,"I got this for my dog during the heat of summer since she loves eating ice so much! She likes this toy, although she gets bored with it very easily (I guess it's the crunch factor of ice she's missing) so it normally sits on the floor until it melts. Word to the wise, don't let your dog have this toy once it's thawed out - at least not if they're an extreme chewer like my dog. She put a hole in one of the corners within a few minutes since it's just canvas and stuffing. Probably my fault, but at least I was able to sew it up and she doesn't mess with the patched corner when it's frozen. I've learned my lesson to pick it up if she stops playing with it to avoid her destroying it completely. Overall, she seems to like it and it freezes pretty quickly!"
2,Don't waste your money,"This is a good but unremarkable toy for the very light chewer in your life. It's basically just a fabric bone that you soak in water. The bag you're supposed to store it in broke when we tried to take the bone out after freezing it. It doesn't have any vanilla smell as they claim. And after the first use our moderate, non-teething dog had ripped out most of the stuffing, rendering it useless.The idea of a frozen toy is a good one, but freezing some knotted up towels would be just as effective. Don't waste your money."
1,Destroyed in 5 mintues by a 4-month old puppy,"Don't waste your money on the Chilly Bone. I thought it would help my 4 month old welsh corgi with teething. He liked it, but chewed a hole in it within 5 minutes. I would have been better off soaking a clean wash cloth and freezing it to let him chew on."
1,Waste of money,"This sounded like a great idea for a teething dog, but it didn't work for either of mine. As another reviewer said, it's basically a fabric toy that you soak in water and freeze - but the plastic bag ripped after being frozen, it thawed quickly leaving a wet mess, and most significantly, neither of my dogs were the slightest bit interested in it. I too would freeze an old wet sock instead."
1,Waste of money.,"Poor materials, poorly constructed, and doesn't hold the cold well at all. Not even for a young puppy, and certainly not for the rambunctious age when they lose their original teeth."
2,RC Helicopter Lower Rotor Head (Blade CX),"Made in several parts making it prone to separation and slipping of parts. Not great and rather expensive. May be more cost effective to replace a few plastic rotor heads over time. Plastic is also lighter, a valid concern with RC helicopter."
4,A must for lovers of Korngold's movie scores,"This late romantic opera has its flaws, but it is a poignant story about love, loss, and ultimately, letting go of the past. This performance is solid all around. The music is evocative and at times exquisite.If you enjoyed the music from THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD or THE SEAHAWK, give this a listen."
3,Best of a poor lot,"We're still waiting for a great Tote Stadt on records. This one features the bad habits of both Leinsdorf and Kollo, and listening to it for more than twenty minutes makes me rush to take if off. But at least you can hear this wonderful, if flawed opera in its totality in decent sound. If only it were better."
2,An O.K. guide,"I had 2 old frame chen style DVDs, and this book is way different from the movements I see in those DVDs.But it has a realistic approach to tai-chi and it's worth it's price."
4,Where's The sword forms???,"Overall a good solid book but the advertisement led me to believe that the sword forms were included( the reason I ordered)and they were not. Just a list of technique names and no graphics to support understanding them. I was disappointed right away but after reading the book on the whole, I considered it a fair exchange for the information included vs. the cost of the book.I will be more careful to read the description and ask questions in the future. I could have complained and returned it (the add was deceptive)but I figure everything happens for a reason so I will just roll with it."
2,It wasn't as I expected!,"When I heared one of the albums tracks on the radio it sound good, but the CD not so good. There were two other tracks I did like, and I think people should buy this CD. Thanks"
2,cardinal cookie cutter never arrived,"this item never arrived as part of my receipt. Didn't realize it until it was time to make cookies. did not intend to give any ""stars"" but was unable to delete them."
4,Great book!,"There are many good recipes in this book, and most take only 20 minutes to prepare. Especially good are the chicken with lemon caper cream sauce, and smoked turkey with goat cheese and pine nuts.Highly recommended for the family on the go."
4,"Some stereotypes, but funny cozy","The has-been star drinks champagne all day long. She has a gay son. She has hot, hunky, grounds keepers. A maid who doesn't like to keep house. Several husbands and an ego the size of... Hollywood. All of these sound pretty stereotypical and banal.What makes this cozy mystery book so funny are the puns, including funny song titles, (""For New Kate"" - say it fast), a bumbling detective or two, and the Hollywood ending where no one is a winner except those who can put the right spin on things. She with the best publicist wins! Amusing."
3,Actually three and a half...,"I found the book to be fast paced, a pleasant diversion, and tres cozy. There is considerable name dropping as other reviews have attested; however, isn't that one of the main reasons to pick up any book about Hollywood? I found Ms. Pepper, past TV superstar and current sleuth, to be very likable in an Auntie Mame/Thelma Ritter sort of way despite her sometimes unrealistic--let them eat cake--take on life. I wish her son's character (Tim) would have been more fully realized as he is the grounding influence in her life. In my mind's eye, in the movie version of this book, I saw a younger Sylvia Sydney as Polly, Tim Daley as her son, and Shelley Morrison as Placenta.Will I read the next one? Probably.I do have one question about the book's author. Is this author Ben Tyler writing under an alias? There is a character with that name in the book who is a screenwriter for the movie where the murders occurred. The full name comes up so many times..."
3,Remains to be Scene,"Interesting plot. Lively characters. Lots of humor. A bit over the top sometimes in the 'name dropping. I'd read another one, but would probably borrow it from someone/where rather than buy it."
4,lightweight and strong,"This thing is as light as a feather, yet very sturdy! The head can be locked down even at very strange tilted angles with my gripped Mark II without any problem. Very well-made tripod! And for the price, you can't go wrong!"
5,great lightweight tripod,"I used this tripod several times on a trip to Moab, UT. It is quite easy to quickly set it up & get it level on uneven terrain. I equipped it with a Manfrotto RC2 Compact Rapid Connect Adapter. That makes it so much more user friendly, enabling you to take your camera off & on quickly & easily!"
5,Great tripod!,"My wife and I recently bought a Canon Rebel XSi, and I wanted to find a good quality tripod that would help us do things like take family portraits (we also bought the Canon RC1). This tripod is really great for the money. It is incredibly light and comes with its own carrying bag. It's extremely easy to set up and take down. It also has a ball head, which makes minor adjustments to angle easy. I haven't tried using it on any angle other than level, so I can't speak to its stability with such a camera at angles. The camera felt solid on the level--I was worried initially that such a light tripod couldn't hold up a DSLR, but it does fine. I suppose if I had to levy an unrealistic expectation on the tripod, I'd like a quick release, but for the price, you're already getting a great value."
5,Useful Tool,"I really am pleased with this tripod! When I just don't want to carry a heavy tripod, this one really is very stable and solid. I've used a fairly heavy SLR on it and it seems to hold it just fine. It fits in a day pack with ease. The ball head works well. Highly recommended."
5,Slick Little Tripod!,"What I like about this tripod is that it's easy to travel with - compact and lightweight yet sturdy and at an affordable price point. It's not as sturdy as a high-end Giottos or Manfrotto, but far better than the cheap lightweight aluminum models out there. The ball head is not large, but sufficient to lock down a DSLR with the kit lens or moderate telephoto. I discovered that it cannot lock down DSLR with a larger, heavier telephoto (such as Nikon 80-200mm f2.8), but with your hands assisting while composing a shot, it definitely helps to steady things. Again, sturdy for the size, nice finish, even allows you to lock the legs out wide for a low shot - overall an excellent price ratio/feature tradeoff."
5,perfect!,A perfect blend of sturdy and light. I am very pleased with this tripod for my canon rebel XT. This product is well made and should last a long time. I purchased a bogen quick release head for it that is also sweet.
5,"Easy, looks great",I bought this to cover a cord on the ceiling that ran from the chandelier to the wall and it does a great job of helping the cord to disappear. Easy to install and cut to desired length.
4,"hides cables well, but....","This item does exactly what we wanted it to do, only problem is the adhesive it comes with is weak. We ended up screwing it into the wall."
4,Great read.,"Again, if you read book one and two of the Morcyth Saga, there must have been something you enjoyed. Come back for more! More epic journeys filled with adventure and danger. Increasing elements of battle and tactics is a plus. Well done Pratt!"
5,Amazing,In this book you never know what to expect. Just like all the other books in the Morcyth saga James get in trouble and usually gets thrown in jail. I suggest you read this book.
4,Understated style,"McDermott is a master at evoking readers' understanding of the characters through a paucity of descriptions of the truly meaningful events in this book. I found the same was true of ""Charming Billy."" The chapters often begin with the event already accomplished that determines the responses and interactions of the characters that then lead to the next chapter. I really enjoy this prose because it is so different from many novelists. McDermott is worth reading."
2,Not for me...,"This is the most beautifully written boring book that I have ever read/listended to. The author has a gift for creating evocative scenes and characters, however, I did not care for the episodic threads that tangled through without beginning or end. I had to force myself to finish it. I kept thinking it would be better by the end. It wasn't - at least for me."
5,sharp observe,"Alice McDermott's narrators are all sharp observers. They see things you might miss. If you like subtlety, you'll find it here as she flits like a butterfly among the characters while they struggle in slightly adverse circumstances. All the little trials of life in Queens, the bus rides, the bills to pay for sending kids to school when there are financial limitations, the meeting of life's challenges, ordinary people doing their best to keep themselves steady while stormy winds blow around them. Why aren't these stories made into films?Nadine Gallo"
4,It took me back in time...nice memories,"I've enjoyed all of McDermott's books, and this one did not disappoint either. McDermott tells great stories involving irish catholic families in New York, with wonderful characters and lives you can relate to on many levels. It did seem to get a bit choppy for my taste 2/3 of the way through though, abruptly jumping to another character just when I was thoroughly absorbed and reluctant to move on."
2,After _what_??,"I tried to stick with this book, I really did. But it just sort of wandered around, people came, people left, etc. When things did happen, they weren't all that pleasant or interesting to read."
1,A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"A LONG AWAITED NEW MCDERMOTT NOVEL, HAVING READ AND RE-READ HER PREVIOUSNOVELS...I SAT DOWN PREPARED TO SAVOR THE IMAGES AND CRISPCELEBRATION OF ""WINDOWS"" INTO LIVES.. I COULD NOT FINISH THIS NOVEL, I COULD NOT GET PAST THE FIRST 3 CHAPTERS, NO CENTER, NOTHING...BORING WORDS STRUNG TOGETHER ON PAGE AFTER PAGE. WHAT, I WONDER?...HAS HAPPENDED TO THE AUTHOR?"
1,could not finish it !!!!,"The writter gives account of every little detail, weather, how a person leans, light, air, street, pavement, etc. etc. etc. and goes on, and on, and on for many, many minutes onend, and the plot? weak, very weak. After going on with so much detail about a small period, suddenly we are there years later without mention of anything, and nothing great happens.Having children?, a fallen tree?? The reader has a wonderful voice and perfect diction but she is not reading, she is reciting as if it was a poem, so it makes the book still more boring. I coulden't even finish the 3rd. disc."
3,Moments of Poetic Insight; Not Much in Sum Total,"Chapters briefly illuminate various members of the Keane family's lives from post-World War II through the 1970's. Standout passages are keen portrayals of individuals, their interactions, and their choices in response to a variety of events: kind, perceptive Mary's journey from aging virgin to wife and mother of four; the sibling rivalry between sensitive Jacob and brash younger brother Michael; the small moments between friends and neighbors in a suburban, Catholic, Long Island community. Death, loss, and the larger political landscape are studied only obliquely. And though certain motifs attempt to stitch the story together (pianos, churches, pregnancies), the overall effect is a crazy quilt plot with no discernible pattern."
3,First half great - then what happened?,"I loved the beginning of this book - the characters are so richly developed. The main couple is very interesting. Then about half way through, when you have barely read any detail about their children, the book turns from them being children to them being in college. I hate it to blunt, but half way through the book, I hadn't developed any interest in the children so the fact that the whole second part of the book is about them and with little more about the parents (who were the main characters) left me very disappointed. It seemed almost like the writer lost track of what was happening in the book and started a new story line without the main characters in it. Very disappointing."
2,"half read, moving on","I have given this book more than it deserves - half a read.I love novels about family life, marriage, raising kids. But this book was ""much ado about nothing."" McDermott has some beautiful poetic language, hence the two stars. But the chapters are too loosely woven together, the events too slow moving and mundane. It reads more like a series of short stories, only afterward spliced together (a trend I am noticing with a lot of contemporary novels). And even so, I kept waiting for something, anything to happen. It's a little too much like real life, the rather dull aspects. Also, too much detail and introspection about everyday commonplace observations. The book needs more editing and a boost of drama.In short, too boring to finish."
2,Disappointing,"I must say this book was a disappointment. Maybe it is just the style of the author I did not care for. At times I found the plotiteresting to keep reading. However, it was hard to follow. The author seems to jump around too much and not stick with a thought.I have no problem with the plot being a so called ""Catholic family"". In fact the plot sounded like my type of book. But, the style of writing is not my cup of tea. I doubt I will seek out other books by Alice McDermott."
3,"Beautifully written, but doesn't gel","Alice McDermott is a wonderfully evocative writer, but for me, the story didn't come together in any meaningful way. More like a series of vignettes or short stories. A little tedious, in fact."
1,Tedious,"This book reads like a series of exercises from a writing class: Describe, in detail, using the five senses as much as possible, the following: a family day at the beach, an unexpected birth, a confused passenger on a bus, a barroom scene, a young girl awaiting an abortion, a nun trying to shock a classroom of bored female students, etc. Truly significant scenes such as courtship, marriage, and death may be reserved for later, more advanced assignments. Bonus points will be given for how many firsts you can identify on a first date.For some readers these set pieces apparently coalesce into a meaningful whole. For this reader it was tedious detail upon tedious detail, for the sake of tedious detail."
2,Just not for me.,"The story started with such potential, but jumped several years into the future and fizzled out. I felt the author only skimmed the surface of her characters, leaving the reader unable to make an emotional investment in any of them. It is rare for me to abandon a book, but this one just wasn't for me."
2,just ok,"it was just ok. i found the ending to be a bit unsatisfying. throughout the book mcdermott intimates that we'll find out what happens to all the characters but the end leaves the reader dangling. also, i found the book to be a downer. not that there's anything wrong with literature that looks at the darker side of life - but if you're not in the mood for that, i would skip this book."
4,So far it works great and easy to install.,"I bought one of the these for a Yamaha Raptor 350. I mounted it on the body panel that clips onto the handlebars and ran the wires below it. The installation was easy and went quickly. The instructions were clear and understandable. I then set the parameters and metric/english settings and it worked just fine. It reads out RPM, MPH, Engine Temperature, Ambient Temperature, and Time. It also has shift point led indicators which also double for overtemperature indicators. I would have given it 5 stars but no shift point or max temperature values were given, I emailed Trail Tech and they had no recommendations. Overall recommended but you'll have to know or find what RPM shift point you want and what the max temperature on your engine is."
3,Kindle formatting needs improvement,"This may be one of those books that needs to be read on paper. I tried the Kindle version, on both a Kindle 2 and a DX, and found it very unsatisfactory. The fonts appear ""grayed out"", as though they were converted from red to gray-scale."
4,Lowgold - Beauty Dies Young,"Beauty dies young is an excellent new track from Lowgold. Allthough the use of the instrumentals is rather aggresive, and the singer at times allmost sounds like a Gallagher, the total composition and result are relaxing, warm, and easy to take to the heart. I think that the artists that manage to make songs that combines calm and aggression in a way that makes the result soothing such as Lowgold are worth a lot more attention than they get. Then again it's good in a way that MTV doesn't slaughter the tracks by playing them once per hour.."
1,"Cheap quality, not worth the price-save your money!","This watch is cheap, tinny, and looks to be worth about $5.00. If you are paying more than that, save your money. I wish I would have."
4,bigger than it looks,"i bought this ball head to go with aBogen Manfrotto 055XPROB Pro Tripod Legs (Black). what is slightly deceiving is the apparent size of the ball head. it looks a lot smaller in the photo. get out your ruler for this one; it measures 4.5"" tall and the quick release plate is 2.25"" in diameter. this is not necessarily a bad thing as upon receiving it i felt as though i got my money's worth.this thing is stout. the machining is precise and tight. the designers put a lot of thought into longevity and there are adjustments to tighten the quick release plate as it begins to inevitably ware. the movement is smooth although i did notice a bit of slipping in the vertical position. the round quick release plate is just that, quick. disconnects fast and reconnects just as fast.there may be heavier duty ball heads on the market, but unless you have a monster of a camera, this excels in every aspect. the pro in the name isn't just a catchy phase."
1,Slik 800....Poor Workmanship,"Dear Slik Company,I purchased two Slik 800 Ball head attachments six months ago from Amazon.com. I am a light duty user of this product and one of the units has already stripped the threads on the quick clamp.Please see the attached technical details explaining the failure mode. Maybe you should take another look at your quality systems. It appears to me that you may have performed too many cost cutting Kiazens on the nut and clamp assembly.I have no choice but to buy a competitive product. With this type of quality, I cannot recommend Slik to any of my fellow photographers.Best Regards,"
5,Fantastic equipment.,"The quick release is a fantastic feature. The ability to move my shots quickly from portrait to landscape mode is very useful. No slippage, once you set your position it holds it. Highly recommend this product."
5,Great Ball Head,"I purchased this item along with the SLIK Titanium Alloy DX700 tripod. Great combo. This ball head is well built and very sturdy. There is a safety feature with the release lever that I thought was clever. You can take both portrait and landscape shots with ease. The adjuster knob is easy to use and very stable. I would recommend this ball head, especially if you have a SLIK tripod."
2,Comfortable but defective,"I've got a pair of these shoes and was very excited, when I received them. Unfortunately they had a huge glue stain on them and were made from material imitating suede, but advertised as a suede shoes.Big disappointment for me"
5,HOROWITZ the Pianist,"Horowitz was a man who all pianists at least respect and most revere. The encores show the public the part of him that spoke of the older, Golden generation. Etincelles, by Moskowski was an encore he stole from Hofmann. Many of the other pieces are ones that pianists now don't even bother looking at. Luckily for us, his concerts were recorded, and amazements such as his Stars and Stripes Forvever are available to us and future generations."
2,Suffers much from poor quality,"Its a shame that Horowitz was in retirement through most of the ""golden age"" of recording in the 60's. I didn't discover until I had it unwrapped (and non-returnable) that most of the pieces on this disk are transfers from pre hi-fi 78's; . Horowitz's magical piano dynamics are mostly lost. Buy it for the content, but not the sound reproduction; which is terrible."
3,Mediocre recording quality,I agree with the positive comments; listening to Horowitz play the piano is a pleasure. The recording quality is mediocre; the hissing is noticeable. This could have been cleaned up but was not. Hence the three stars.
1,Star Wars,This was the most disapointing star wars storyyet. The battles scenes weren't explained in great detail and there were some really boring parts. Overall it wasnt great
1,"Dull, unexciting, to YA ish.","Who wrote this book? A child obviously. I guess Ms. Wrede does not believe in words more than 4 syllables. I'm a huge STAR WARS fan, and I hate to see such slop. Wrede portrays all the characters wrong, and skips most of the interesting technological details. Ms Wrede, stick to child fantasies."
1,do not purchase,Do not purchase not the item you see came in wrong item with a broken O ring nothing but a problem
3,Pearl Fishers and Patroits,"A better CD is Bmg/Rca Victor - #63468 which is a 2-CD set and you get some other goodies like: Pagliacci: Vesti La Giubba and Turandot: Nessun Dorma (Live Version, With Piano).I"
3,Pearl Fishers Duet,"The Pearl Fishers Duet by Georges Bizet is well presented and delightfully sung. There are several additional duets on this CD which, whilst sung correctly and well, do not come over with the same lightness and flow. They would not be the best of their genre."
4,Nice for the $,"I have this with head unit and it does a good job with, its pushing 2 dual 6x9's, 2 dual 6.5's and a Sony 1300w sub. its a nice unit if your on a budget, and it comes with a wiring harness that you have to soulder, if you know how to do that than it can save you a few bucks from buying a harness."
1,fake out,They never sent this item to me. After cashing in my points to get this device they said sorry we no longer have this product. Then they said they would credit my card the money they charged me and they did not credit my credit card back.
4,Good product but needs separate Wah pedal,I have used this for 3 year now. My only complaint is that when you go to wah mode you need to adjust the volume on your amp first. For those of you who have used line 6 amps you know that changing amp models changes the tone settings and thus changes the volume so having volume adjustment capability is very important. You can use your guitar volume knob but I find the foot pedal more convenient for adjust my volume. I am going to purchase the long board as it has the pedals separate.
5,Works on Deere 2520 (Yanmar engine),"Installed without too much trouble in a Deere 2520 with the 3 cylinder Yanmar, so I'm sure anything else with that engine it would fit. Just a note, it needs a 1-3/8"" socket to get it on and I couldn't find that info anywhere ahead of time. It took quite a bit of force on a long breaker bar to get it to seal up, if i were doing it again I'd put some pipe sealant on it ahead of time. I only plugged it in to test it out and it did heat up the area around the plug. Haven't had to really use it yet, but I'm sure it will work fine. Also, note that it does not look like the picture, it is pipe threaded."
1,Really bad kung fu movies!!! 1/2 star for each movie!,"I'm an avid kung-fu collector who owns over 300 old school kung fu DVDs, and I could not even bring myself to watch either of these movies till the end. I own all three of the 18 Bronzemen movies so I thought I would like this. It was so bad that I didn't even want to return it or sell it on Amazon where someone else might buy it. I threw it in the garbage where it belongs. Picture quality is horrible, sound is dubbed badly, and the plot and action scenes are the worst I've ever seen. DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE! Any Shaw Brothers film is 1000 times better."
4,staple size,"Just got makita at2550a stapler for christmas so haven't had much time to use it but it works..I ordered some extra staples from another website and I discovered that 1 inch wide crown staples are not all the same..Stanley Bostich staples are too narrow to fit this stapler..You must use SENCO PW200, Hitaschi N5024a and similar staples. B&C Eagle SDW-1 staples will fit..Hope you find this helpful...Chucke"
2,fine,nice but when i first opened the clasp it basically broke. this is a nice final fantasy icon the back panel was in japenese.
4,Another Fun Disc from Something Weird,"It's old, the script is horrible, the acting is worse, the storyline is like a bad joke...In other words, it's a perfect ""Something Weird"" video; so bad that it's good. And it has naked chicks. Great double feature if you're a fan of these cheap, ""B"", slightly naughty films."
4,Unique and weird = perfect,"Cinderella (or in this case, Sinderella)as a nudie musical. Just when you think you've seen it all, this little gem comes along. I wish I would have thought of this. I can't elaborate on anything more than what has already been written by other reviewers with the exception of the fact that everybody in the cast looks like they are having a blast. As usual in these types of films, Russ Meyer buxotic, Althea Currier, makes an appearance as one of the King's Ladies in Waiting, assisting him with his knitting hobby. She also appears as the village maiden who is too busty to properly fit into the golden bra. Depending on your frame of mind the day you watch this, you may think of this film as a classic."
3,Not Porn,"If you're looking for sexual interaction, this is the WRONG movie for you. You'll never even see a full frontal nude scene. The girls are beautiful and for a 50' style flick, it would be considered a pg-17, but not an R and definitely not an X.If you're into just T&A;, you're in the right spot, because that's ALL you get to see. If this is sold for more than $3.00, you wasted your money, unless you like that stuff."
3,Nudist camp,"Herschell Gordon Lewis's ""Goldilocks and the Three Bares"" is a funny and campy film about nudism and relationships. It is a cheerful, likeable film about a group of work collegues who try nudism, enjoy its liberating effects and find their friendship reaffirmed.Bill Kerwin is especially funny as a comedian with a smart crack for everything. The films is padded out with an overlong mude cruise on the river, but you will enjoy this 1960s grindhouse oddity.I'm pleased, however, that Mr Lewis movied on from nudies. There really is only such much you can milk out of this genre.I didn't especaially go for ""Sindarella"", but I was surprised that the songs were pretty good for this kind of film. If you liked ""Flesh Gordon"" you will probably like this. The ""Golden Bra"" angle is a funny take on the Cindarella story.I suppose the ideas are funnier than the actual execution of them."
1,A waste of time and money.,This is a thumbs down for Something Weird as far as I'm concerned. I purchased this one because the others I have purchased where not to bad. Sorry I got this one.
5,back to the beginning,"When TMNT was introduced, I had my doubts but after putting my pride aside and lighten up in places... I gave the series a go. Very dramatic for an animated series and does serve as a tribute to the original graphic novel by the team of Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird. The Turtles are about 15 years of age, each one unique in personality and fighting technique. the first meeting of Raphael and Casey Jones is classic, Baxter Stockman... very nasty (not the geek of the first animated series) and Shredder (no shame). Plenty of action, comedy and great storyline... I give Season 1, Part 1 a 10 (10 fingers)."
3,"Too little, too late.","I have to agree with A. Brown, as I've been collecting the new series ever since it hit DVD several years ago. NOW, they decide to bring them out the RIGHT way? Although, I must admit, this will solve the problem of the ""out of order"" episodes , since some were released on ""theme"" DVDs (i.e. ""Mutants & Monsters""). Assuming, that is, that ALL the seasons are brought out on DVD, one after another. So, I'm torn; while it would be NICE having the episodes all in ORDER (and taking up less space in my collection), it's rather unfair to make me purchase them ALL OVER again because it wasn't done right the FIRST time."
5,Buy one for each piece...,Thought I'd mention the obvious since I ran into someone out in the field who was screwing one of these into multiple instruments which defeats the whole quick release purpose. They are solidly built and easy to use.
5,So glad these are available...,"No idea how my original release shoe was lost, but thank goodness I found a replacement here. In fact, I should probably order a couple extras."
2,Lack of Citation,"I found that this book is a practical book as it gives lot of do's and don't. However, this book should incorporate proper citation method. For instance, on page 6, ""Research has shown... audience may not return to a medium one they have abandoned it for another."" I would like to know who says this and form where it is obtained.On page 241, the writers quote Judith Lewis book on Trauma and Recovery. I just wondering form what page was it extracted. Nevertheless, this book complements many other books as it gives media practitioner stand point. Certainly they need ""polishing"" as written on page 16."
1,"Useless, Terrible explanations","rented this book for a class, felt as if this book did not help improve my writing. did not explain why certain rules existed when needed. did not explain how to write for communications. feel extremely underqualified to write anything now."
1,Piece of Junk,"This product worked for about three minutes. Sometimes would not turn on, and even then, only played songs one time, then stopped playing. Also, not compatible with Rhapsody service. I do not recommend."
4,Read the whole series,"And learn about the culture and history of the North American people and have fun doing it. Every book is a great story. The characters are always so well formed, and the storyline well laid out, like the Gears had a time machine and really went back and wrote down what was really being said and done at that exact moment."
3,another good book by the gear's,this is a decsent gear book it is a murder mistry. the problem with it is while investegating the murder the old dreamer does the same thing over and over every day but somehow still finds out how did it. but there is a big surprise at the very end that make it a good read.
5,Captivating till the end,"This was the last novel I read by the Gears and I truly enjoyed it. I felt like I was a part of the characters lives'. It was as if I myself was trying to solve a mystery. The characters showed how superstition and tales can cloud the opinions of many people.. Sun Conch had the ability to see through the tales and lies to help a friend in need, giving up some of the most important things to her. As the novels winds down, the slueth of the story comes up with some electrifying clues to a very puzzling murder. If you've enjoyed the other Gear novels this one will surely keep you on the edge of your seat.."
5,Best Metal Pickup,"Yep. This is the best metal pickup you can get. It's the most responsive pickup for high gain amps that I've ever used. So much clarity and attack even with low tunings. I swear by this and have one in each of my metal guitars. If you want versatility, pair a coil tap with the X2N. Since the X2N is such a high output pickup in itself, it's coiled tapped sound isn't some flaccid mush. It's actually very usable for cleans and grungy dirt."
1,Boring - lost interest,"This book is snippets of conversations from people who were influences in the .com era. Unfortunately, there are so many people, I have no idea who JOHN is or what project he was related with. And I don't care. The book does nothing to tell a story. Its not really a book...its more like journal someone would use to write a book.I am very interested in the real-life stories of .com businesses...how they got started, how big they got and how they fell from grace.This is not one of those books."
1,Really NOT worth reading.,This 'book' is nothing but a collection of stutters from too many people. There is no central character to follow. Its really hard to stay motivated in reading this.
4,ADVENTUROUS,"Great book. The author took me through an adventurous travel too several different countries and cultures. One moment I felt I was on the beach with Roberta and the next I could see myself sitting on the porch at Villa Fair looking over the land. My favorites were Villa Fair and Blue Door. The author causes you to become emotional for these characters, so much so, it makes you want to reach out to them. The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because I wanted more in the Blue Door and Villa Fair. I loved this book and have gotten similar responses from my book club following our review. We are looking foward to future publications from Ms. Dyer."
5,Remembering Horowitz,"Rachmaninov, on hearing Horowitz play his difficult concerto in private to him, remarked to someone afterwards, that VH ""had swallowed it whole!"" Need one say more?"
4,A great recording,Horowitz at his best. the recording captures the sound of the piano strikingly clear and full bodied.Rachmaninoff played with the grace and gusto as was meant to be heard.Bravo Horowitz...Bravo Rachmaninoff!
5,Great family movie,A funny film for everyone in the family. Relatable for kids and adults. A fresh alternative to all of the animated shows that are most often the most appropriate. We really enjoyed watching it as a family!
1,Dissappointed,It did not work in my machine! The dvd does but not the blue ray.. Bought is for my 2 little girls for valentines... it was a dud...
3,It's OK,"I have to say that my daughter really loved this movie. She first saw it in school and thought it was fantastic. I was looking forward to seeing it with her, but have to say I wasn't over impressed. I can't say it was horrible, but it just didn't grab me. I didn't come to love the characters. I didn't much care what happened at the end. I love kids movies...family friendly hits are always a treat, but this one was a take it or leave it sort of film for me. When I told my daughter, she just shrugged her shoulders and said, ""Well Mom, God made everyone different and maybe he made you not to like this movie!"" I got a kick out of that. But it's true...there is always something for everyone, and this just wasn't for me. My daughter, however, really enjoyed it."
2,movie,Bought this for my 10 year old daughter - she is not interested in it. Haven't made it all the way through movie - lost interest and did something else.
3,"Movie = OK,...Playability = IFFY","I bought this movie for my 3 year old niece and when I put it in to watch it, it wouldn't play. (I was using a PS3 for which I use ALL Blu Rays without problem,..til now). I send that disc back as defective and quickly got another one in. Played it,..same thing. I just decided to keep it anyway and my niece watched the DVD version."
5,Enjoyable family movie.,"Our family all enjoyed this movie. My daughter who 8 years old, smiled throughout most of the movie and seemed to relate to the characters. Great family movie with nothing inappropriate in it."
1,Major disappointment -- the books are so fun,"Movies are rarely if ever as good as the book, but this movie seemed to take nothing from the book except the names of the characters and a ""get in and out of trouble"" theme. Missed a great opportunity to tell the story as Cleary wrote it."
3,Good but not perfect,"Spoilers below:This movie changes some important parts from the book - mainly the ages of the characters.There is too much kissing. It is stupid - we don't care about these relationships, we want to hear about Beezus and Ramona like they are in the books. Here, Henry Huggins is like 18 and that's too old.Also, there is one very sad part that need not be in the film - one character dies. This really is disturbing.Other than this, it is a good movie. Ramona and Howie are good characters.Ramona also runs away in this movie. We thought the parents had a strange and inappropriate reaction to this, even though they meant well."
5,RAMONA,THIS WAS A GREAT MOVIE! GOOD FOR THE TEENAGERS AND CHILDREN 6 TO 12. EVEN AS AN ADULT I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED IT. GREAT FAMILY MOVIE!
2,Doesn't follow the book Selena Gomez outshined by a 9 year old.,"I never grew up reading Beverly Clearly's books but I know some who have, but there's a lesson here. Selena Gomez has become such a star at only 19 years old that if you put her name or face on anything it will sell not matter how good or bad it is because she has become a heartthrob in her generation. Bottom line is this movie should not be tied to the books. And I watched parts of it. Couldn't finish it. 9 year old Joey King is the real star of this film as Gomez falls flat."
3,Bought as a gift...,"...for my young niece to go along with the book. She liked it, and also liked that she could read along with it. Good for a grade-school aged girl."
4,Cute little movie for the kids,"My daughter loved this movie and has rented it on more than one occasion. I found it to be pretty funny and unique. Selena Gomez isn't the star, which is nice."
5,Great movie!,"This movie is a fabulous family movie! We loved it! Amazon instant streaming for movies is the best! If you are looking for a fun movie night, you can't go wrong with this one."
5,great movie for a little girl,"my daughter & i saw this at the theater - she was 6 1/2 at the time. she loved it (i did, too - loads of stuff to keep adults entertained in it)! it was released on this lovely combo pack right around her 7th birthday, so we had to get it....she watches it as often as we will let her. i love that it came with a digital copy - it now lives happily on her little ipod, so she can watch it on road trips.this is a great family movie, and is especially appreciated my my little girl...!"
5,Ramona & Beezus,"Okay, I must admit that I have never read the books. My wife has and she refuses to watch this movie because the books were so dear to her. Whatever the case I rented it and watched it on a sick day, and found that this film was a treat. Of course it's predictable and has a very ""Hollywood"" happy ending, but it was surprisingly fun to watch. If you like family films - give it a try!"
4,Heart- warming,"The story was imaginative, but as I saw the movie my childhood memories were so vividly brought back. It was hilariousand yet made me cry."
4,Better Than Expected!!!,"I saw this earlier, and I thought it was decent and fun for the whole family. It has a solid storyline and a good message, along with tender moments. Joey King was cute and adorable as Ramona, but Beezus didn't really do too much. Ramona Quimby is a hyper 3rd grader with an overactive imagination. When her dad is hired, she bonds with him and tries to build up his confidence, while trying to save the house and deal with her aunt falling back in love with an old boyfriend. I would recommend RAMONA AND BEEZUS!!!"
4,good movie/dissatisfied with the delivery.,"Good movie.I ordered it for a Christmas present on December 14th-2010 and I received it a month later on January 12th-2011. I was very upset , my daughter was missing a present under the tree. :("
5,Great movie! A must buy!,I didn't think this movie looked that great from the previews but it was awesome. My daughter and I loved it. It had it all. I will definitely buy this movie and you won't be sorry if you do too.
5,"""Ramona Movie is a great little jewel""",This movie is so heartwarming and it melts your heart and i am glad i gave this movie a chance and i can watch this movie over and over again and i cant wait to add this to my movie collection and any age would enjoy this little jewel of a movie!....
4,Cute family movie,"The little girl that plays Ramona is absolutely adorable. What perfect casting for this accident-prone, tries to do good little girl. Aunt B is also perfect casting."
4,Ramona and Beezus Movie,This was a gift for my 3-year old granddaughter. She was so excited when she opened the gift as it was a movie she had been wanting. We all watched the movie together. It was enjoyed by all -- a good family movie. Very cute.
2,Cute but very cliché,"Another childhood story about children discovering the pleasures and troubles of life, etc etc. The story is cute and serves it right when you are not up to think about anything, but has all the cliché elements that make a child story."
5,"Cute, cute movie!","I read (and loved) all of the Ramona books growing up and so for me, there was high expectations for this film. It is such a great movie, I loved it! There are not many movies these days that make you smile and have a warm feeling to them - one you wouldn't be ashamed to watch with kids, but also enjoy watching yourself. Highly recommend for people of all ages!"
3,"Well Fit, Hope it last longer","Nice packaged, and shipping fast. It fits my Canon D320 printer very well.However, the ink runs out faster than expected, so very soon I have to order another cartridge."
1,Not as advertised,"This product is described as a ""Canon S35 copier toner cartridge for Canon imageClass D320/D340"" and is listed as manufactured by Canon. However, what arrived is a non-name generic cartridge that is not OEM."
5,"Great toner from ""GreatToners Company""","Although I cannot vouch for the excellence of all offered compatible toners, the Canon S35 toner I got via Great Toners worked just as well as the original toner, particularly in the darkness of printing. You could see the graphics on the page just as clearly as the original. I highly recommend purchasers consider this product, especially from this company."
4,very good deal,"very good i recomend it, in stead of payin g 130 for one i got 2 for 50.00 bucks and they come in separate boxes and well packed."
2,Toner cartridge prints light,"After installed cartridge in Canon printer, printed documents appeared very light, and cartridge has to be removed, and shook quite a few times, and reinstalled. This appeared to work for awhile, but the problem persists. The second cartridge is going to be installed in the next few days since it was bought together, and it will be checked out soon."
3,Ink for Canon Imageclass D320,"The cartridge fits and works with my Canon Imageclass D320.Installs easy and it is cheap, but only lasted a few months.Theoretically the Canon cartridges are rated for around 3,500 - 5,000 pages. The toned-down one that shipped with the printer even ran longer than this one. This compatible cartridge was good for maybe 1,000 - 1,500 pages at most. The last few hundred of those prints entailed periodically taking out the cartridge when the print would get faint or streaked and shaking the cartridge. Afterwards I'd put it back in the printer and it would be good for another 100 or so prints.Given few other choices I'd buy this again, but would look check out the other compatible cartridges to see if there is anything better first."
3,"When you Listen the songs,it's from another artist's Album!!","The image of the cover is the right one.the songs' List also.But when you listen(or try to)to the songs,they belong to an Art blakey live album!!!!!please! Amazon people.get the right songs to listen to.this is an excellent album from the 70's,by a band not many remember these days."
1,Absurd,"This is little more than newspaper clippings crudely pasted together to form the pages of a ""book."" I couldn't believe it, and I was annoyed that I'd paid such a high price for this ""brochure."" There is nothing new here, folks."
1,fun while it lasted....,"i got this a month ago..... sadly it only lasted 4 days... evrything had the cheap feel of a McDonads ""happy meal"" toy. it was fun to use everything though but sadly it died withen 4 days. =(..... if you are planning on getting one i hope your's stays working .... but im NOT saying it wasnt fun, i loved it! it really made the sp even cooler than it already is.. but mine had a short life..ight thankiesPEACE"
5,"Examples, Examples, and More Wonderful Examples","Unlike so many books on this subject, you do not have to be a Stanford MBA to understand the author. The writing is crisp, clear, and to the point. While the author covers a great deal of material, there is little wasted verbiage. The author does a good job of blending theory and practice in his writing, while drawing heavily on numerous academic studies to substantiate the points being made.The book is chock full of lucid examples to illustrate ideas that are commonly used by investment bankers, brokers, and other analysts. I have read a number of finance books both in school and in my own practice which claim to discuss such challenging topics as M&A and this is one of the few that does an effective job. This book is clearly for the serious student, i.e., one who is interested in getting a solid grounding in the subject. Those looking for a passing acquaintance with the subject should stick with the trade press and the WSJ."
5,Excellent Book,This is an excellent book and covers the entire process thoroughly. Well written and organized book.
1,Insufficient and Lacking,This book is quite disorganized. It seems that the author would have been better served to take some time out to go over the book again prior to releasing it. It reads like a disorganized combination of miscellaenous ideas. The result is a confused presentation that neither serves the practitioner nor the academic MBA student. The book also seem to rehash parts of a treatment of M&A that has been out for many years in other books such as Gaughan's Mergers Acquisitions and Corporate Restructurings. This book does not add to the field but merely repeats what is already out there in other books and does so in a poorly organized way.
2,Can Belto...But not much else.,"I'm an Alagna fan, have all his CDs. As the previous reviewer noted, this is a fascinating one -- but more so for how absolutely wrong-headed it is. This is not the ideal repertory for a singer with as light (and that's a compliment), romantic and expressive a voice as Alagna. Or perhaps he just doesn't know what to do with it. He pretty much bellows each number, throwing the notes out to the 5th balcony -- unfortunately, not always hitting them correctly. In fact, Alagna is so often singing below the pitch here that when he actually nails a note dead-on it's a bit startling. If you don't know this singer's work, by all means start with his debut CD, his French arias CD, or perhaps the first CD he recorded with his wife Angela Gheorgieu. If you are a fan and must have this CD, don't say you weren't warned."
5,"Beautiful voice, beautiful music","""Bel Canto"" is a superb recording. Roberta Alagna isin excellent voice and the selections he sings are gorgeous.Every aspect and nuance of his vocal talents are displayedamptly-including many high C's and even a high D. If youare an opera fan-this is one CD you will want in your collection."
5,Great book.,"Excellent book, can't stop reading this series. I'm very interested to see how Hollywood butchers this series. Read more books people."
5,THE Book on Indiana High School Cathedrals!!!!,"This is absolutely the best book that I have ever seen of this kind. I'm an Indiana basketball junkie who is currently studying at Penn State. I read this book every night before I go to bed. I bore my roommate to death with stories about the Wigwam, Chrysler Fieldhouse, and of course, Hinkle Fieldhouse. I have actually planned road trips with my high school buddies because of this book. It would serve everyone well to make a trip to Knightstown, to see the gym where Hoosiers was filmed. Anyway, Hamilton does an excellent job of giving rich history and great photos of hundreds of Indiana's greatest gyms. This is a must read for all Hoosier basketball fans."
3,"Okay, but only if you're from Indiana",I have a relative that lives in Indiana. She has Hoosier Temples and I read it last time I was at her home. It was a good book but only if you're from indiana will you know what all the history means.
4,Clue for Drama majors,"I always wanted to attend one of those murder mystery dinners like on the shows Just Shoot Me and 3rd Rock From the Sun.I got this a couple years ago for christmas and FINALLY got around to playing it. The thing was finding 8 people total to play it. My friends arent exactly the big game type, but I got everyone together and once we got the hang of it, the game was pretty cool. You're each a different character and know things, and must reveal facts. It's a longer game-not Monopoly long, but have some time to kill. I'll probably buy another How to Host a Murder game since you can only play it one time really. But not bad, they did a great job with the story and characters."
5,An Eyclopedic reference for linear and integer prog.,"A great reference text book, with some great historical notes about the history of both linear and integer programming.It is the first book, both me and my advisor check out, when we require any thing on Linear and Integer Programming."
5,Excelent book,"It's an excelent book, but in order to use it as a classroom book I will make two improvement1) Add an exercises section at the end of each chapter2) Deal more extensively with Mixed Integer Linear Programming problem, e. g. add the proof of the finiteness of the Gomory's Cutting Plane Method."
1,Poorly written with nothing new to add,"I am writing a review on this book a bit too late. However, better late than never. This book is simply not worth the money. In review of this book, I do have to agree with ""gregohb"" that contextually, this book is nothing more than a rehash of the manuals. Just read the manual. It really isn't that bad. There are much better writers on the topic of Logic as well. As recommended by ""gregohb"" look up a guy named Len Sasso. I am surprised this book even got published."
2,Buyer Beware...,"Beware of what seems like a price that's too good to be true. What they don't tell you is the do not include acid with this battery, so what you receive for your $60 is just the battery case. You will need to go purchase your own acid, raising the cost higher than most other retailers on the web for this item."
5,I loved it!,"If you've seen these on the Sundance channel and liked them, then you owe it to yourself to buy this DVD. The films themselves are great but when you watch them with the audio commentaries, you get a whole new layer of understanding about what's going on behind the scenes, and they answer alot of the burning questions I had about some of the relationships between the ""characters"". Also they cover some of the technical aspects like what cameras were used.Cool of the filmmaker to included both films on one DVD; the DVD is dual-layer, so they don't skimp on image quality (although the films were shot on video).Some reviews have called this a real-life ""Spinal Tap"" but that is really not accurate. In style it's really closer to the Maysles' ""Great Gardens"" for its sympathetic character studies than as a lampoon of its subject.Thanks Dan, Thanks Rolf, Thanks Jeff. Thanks Jacque."
5,Gilder is the best in predicting technology / economy.,"As former Director of Broadcast Engineering for Alabama Public Television, (America's oldest PBS Network) I can say that my 38 years of Telecom, Technology, and Broadcast experience strongly suggests that everthing I've ever read by George Gilder is excellent. George's books and Forbes /ASAP articles are an excellent reference for anyone concerned in how technology has and will continue to affect the economy of the U.S. and the World. James Foley -- Alpha Communications & OMNI Telecom"
3,OK lens cap,"There are better lens caps out there. The main reason I don't like it too much is the design. Instead of having the tabs to push in on the outside for removing it, its in the inside. Since its a 37mm cap, putting the tabs on the inside make it difficult for those with even average sized fingers. If you have large hands I would look for another option. Also because of the design of putting the tabs on the inside, this is one of the thickest lens cap I've seen. Almost about 2-3 times thicker than most other ones."
5,Excelente,"Probablemente, la novela que más he disfrutado en mi vida. Me pareció muy personal, íntima y cierta."
5,an excellent and absorbing book!,"This was an excellent book. It vividly brings to life what it must have been like to have had leprosy and to have lived in this remote and lawless colony. The author doesn't ever flinch from describing the suffering and conditions of the colony, but the focus of the book is on Liliha's growth and maturation as a person. Liliha begins the book as a frightened and angry child, scheming to get her mother to come rescue her. She suffers in the colony, and does what she has to to survive. But she grows beyond her childishness and selfishness, and accepts her disease and her exile. She learns to rely on and care for her friends, and to become a responsible and caring person in return. The book is fascinating in its details of such a remote and difficult existance, while the characters and plot are deeply absorbing."
5,In The Shadow Of The Pali Book Review,"""I can't stay here forever, Hana. Not for the rest of my life"". The book, In The Shadow of The Pali captures the attention of teens everywhere. The book is about a 12 year old girl named Liliha who has leprosy in the 1870s. Liliha is banned to an island in Hawaii to live and try to survive by herself. The story invites teens to see how life was during this time and demonstrates a story of a young girl trying to survive the wilderness by herself in such horibble conditions. Liliha is faced with many opsticles such as finding food, building shelter, and also trying not to get killed by others on the island. In the book she befriends a boy named Manukekua who is faced with the same opsticles as herself. The book continues to talk about how Liliha and Manukekua try to find a way to escape and to go back home to their families. In The Shadow of The Pali is a fantastic book that every teen who is interested in adventure and suspense should read."
3,OK but not a favorite,"I am not a big fan of opera. This beautiful movie deserves a beautiful haunting sound not found on this cd as per other viewers also. Try 1992 soundtrack version by Ryiuchi Sakamoto. Has beautifully haunting sound, but no singing or opera on cd. Hard to find though."
1,An opera singer plays Cathy?,"Wuthering hieghts was a big letdown for me. I got it for my birthday and rushed to listen to it. i shouldn't have bothered. cathy is an opera singer and Heathcliff is a wimp. the only good singers are Nelly and Hindley. The only song I liked at all was 'One Rules my Heart' this is supposed to be a musical? If he wanted to write an opera, write an opera.(this guy also wrote musicals of Pride and Predgiduce and Much Ado About Nothing, two of my favorite stories which I don't care to hear mangled, thank you very much!"
4,Décisions mortelles,"J'ai bien aimé cette lecture du monde de l'antropologie judiciaire. L'héroine, Temperance Brennan est antropologue judiciaire et enqute à Montréal sur des meutres commis par des gangs de motards. Elle est appelé à faire partie de l'escouade Carcajou. Une escouade mise sur pied spécialement pour combattre les motards criminalisés. Lors de cette enqute, elle n'a pas une très bonne relation de travail avec ses nouveaux coéquipiers et son neveu, Kit, en visite chez elle, lui complique la vie en se frottant aux vendeurs de Harley Davidson et en se liant d'amitié avec un journaliste télévisé. Un livre à suspensetrès bien écrit et que j'ai bien aimé."

5,Engaging and stimulating,"This book is fantastic and a source of pride! I studied this period in undergrad. and I love to read anything I can find on the Harlem Renaissance. The book is beautifully done, the photos are great and the choices are interesting. Wondered why the authors placed Bill Robinson in the DC section, but the bios are concise and complete. A great book for young people as well as students of the period."
5,The Churches the Apostles left behind,More than I had hoped for. Thorougly researched and presented in a straight forward manner.
4,Raymond Brown a great Biblical resource,"Thank you, Raymond Brown, for your scholarly treatment of Early Church history. A scholar of some considerable repute, Brown dives into the often complicated Apostolic, sub-Apostolic beginnings of Christianity in an effort to recreate a tumultuous period that resulted in the rapid spread of the new faith. Sometimes a bit heavy-going, it is nevertheless an important work valuable to any student of this period and a wonderful companion volume to the study of Acts."
4,Fascinating and Readable!,"As with *The Community of the Beloved Disciple,* this volume avoids the pitfalls of being either too simplistic or just over one's head. In it, Brown offers an ingenious look at the various communities of the Christian Testament and describes their differences.For my particular tastes, Brown is sometimes too quick to accept the face value of some early traditions concerning the Apostles. But this slight weakness is easily overcome by his scholarship, his open attitude and his readability. This volume is very helpful and will open the eyes of its readers to the fact that there has not been only one ecclesiology is Christianity, but many."
4,Norwegian band,"These guys do have some Deep Purple sound.It could just be the era of the music.They're versatile and talented,very talented.Sometimes it's like listening to 3 or 4 different bands.Especially on their 1st & 2nd albums.There is some great songs.The more you listen the more you like.That to me is the sign of good music.Also there lead singer is fantastic in my opinion.Just remember this stuff is 40 years old,but they were ahead of the time a bit.Some of there songs are as good as you'll get."
5,Should be required reading,"...should be required reading at all degree levels...the better to understand who this no-show Clinton-Bush-Obama government worker generation really is who have plunged you into wars-without-end...and on YOUR dime, to boot!"
5,Long Tie Passing,The servcewas excellent. I have not finished the book yet but so far it is everything I was tolf it would be.
2,Get A Different DVD,"I just watched it and the picture/sound are terrible, even making the obvious allowances. Another company's DVD is said by a reviewer on this site to be superior to this one, so you should take a chance...it certainly can't be worse than this one."
3,Glorifying the american girl dvd,"I enjoyed watching this dvd,not the best quality butI realize that because its an old film and it was a low price dvd, it would be nice if Kino had done it. Anyway the picture seemed to make the people in the film look a little short and stubby, the sound was good, for the cheap price it was worth it,I enjoyed watching Mary Eaton."
3,Flawed Commentary,"I usually enjoy the input from Johnny Legend but he makes some serious mistakes throughout the commentary tracks, particularly ""Mondo Freudo"". He chose to watch the film without sound and obviously knew little about what was going on except trying to identify locales. One segment he continues to think is taking place in England and it clearly states it San Fran on the narration. I think it would be wise to at least watch the film prior to doing a commentary and not rely on personal experience and name-dropping. The films are not bad, a little boring in spots but the production credits make them essential cult material. I would have liked to known a bit more about the film segments (what's actually staged and what's real) but the commentators chose to do rambling monologues on personal experiences and neither individuals had anything to do with the films. It's still an interesting package though. Mike Vraney should have listened to the commentary before releasing."
5,Excelllent and safe LCD cleaner,"My Nikon Digital SLR Camera's LCD panel had become messy with fingerprints, cheek prints, and so forth. Worse though, an old LCD panel protector had left behind residue when it was removed. I thought I was facing expensive camera repairs, but the Targus LCD Cleaning Kit cleaned my Nikon LCD panel quickly and spotlessly, including the residue from the old LCD panel protector. I was amazed and grateful. I highly recommend the Targus LCD Cleaning kit."
2,Not enough information,"The DVD format was for the UK and I live in the US. No mention of this on the purchase site. I can watch it on my computer, but my DVD player will not play it. This should be information clearly stated so that anyone could know prior to purchase."
1,Batra was Wrong but he Writes again regardless,Professor Ravi Batra did economic analysis to predict the Great Depression of 1990 (and he wrote a book about it of course). Now he is using those same powerful economic tools to blow the whistle on Alan Greenspan.
1,lack of credibility and scholarship,"greenspan can be criticized for many things, but fraud is not one of them. the absurdity in batra's earlier works continues unabated in this one. his earlier works have been discredited, his theses overwhelmingly proven false, and his predictions have clearly failed to materialize.incapable of producing respectable academic work, batra has resorted to publishing spurious, unsubstantiated, and just plain silly slanders."
1,don't belive this nut case,"as i wrote in the head line don't belive this nut case. look at the facts in the last 15 years the US economy was much better of than any developed nation this is in contrast to the 70""s and 80""s were we were falling behind ,had high inflation. greenspan steered the economy the smoothest for such a long time without any major recessions or high inflation.yes we had some problems in 1999-2002 and if we turn back the watch greenspan maybee should have acted diffrent but therewas no banker that did better and the greenspans policy hellped us recover so fast that in the last two years we are again the fastist growng developed economy"
1,Predictable and boring.,I could hardly get through this. There was copious academic jargon that was used to mask the true lack of understanding the author had of the everyday principles that drive everything from Wall Street to a guy selling hot dogs on the street. I chalk this mistake up to an author that has spent too much time viewing the world from his ivory tower. Don't waste your time on this like I did.
1,Failed Batra Strikes Again,"I almost feel sorry for this guy, everything he predicts has been proven wrong. Now he wants to rewrite history? It is amazing how such a 'boring' man in Greenspan is so fasinating, but for Batra to take the time to smear a man who takes home women and reads them journal articles on monetary policy to impress his date?I picked this book up for amusement, I couldnt possible believe people here could have taken him seriously! It is a good laugh but after he discredits Greenspan for having success and not even having a PHD!!! Pure LOL"
4,Amazon Experience.,"I should just type a form review about Amazon. love their convenience, service, care about whether I'm happy with my purchases. Amazon is wonderful. I am physically challenged. (does that really sound better than handicapped?) I can't go to the bookstore or any other store, but I can browsw here at home and find whatever I need or want easily and at a reasonable price. Books are easy. I even found a battery for my husbands drill that I'd been told wasn't made any more. Iove Amazon. The Greenspan book was great."
3,It's not Greenspan's fraud,"It's not Greenspan's fraud. That would be giving Mr. Greenspan too much credit. The Federal Reserve is a fraud that was formed long before Greenspan was made its chairman. Greenspan has done a reasonable job of keeping the false prosperity intact, but it won't last. Like all Fed chairman before him he just counterfeited a bunch of money. Take a look at our incomes vs the cost of living and it becomes obvious we haven't made any progress at all. A Great Depression is the only way to resolve the economic distortions the Fed has enabled."
2,a known hack is at it again,"Also see, among many hack pieces by this fool, ""Surviving the Great Depression of 1990: Protect Your Assets and Investments--And Come Out on Top"". Note: I only browsed this latest issue from Mr. Batra, but suffice to say this guy is very much a third rate mind who writes only for like minded chicken littles whose lives would only be fulfilled with schadenfreude should any of Mr. Batra's pronouncements come true."
5,SR GREENSPAN ???????,"I GUESS WE COULD BLAME OUR CURRENT ECONOMIC DIASTER ON GREENSPAN. HE DOES NOT BELEIVE IN REGULATIONS. THINKS PEOPLE WILL DO THE HONORABLE THING. HE SAID HE WAS SHOCKED, DURING HIS RECENT CONGRESSIONAL HEARING, THAT EXECUTIVES DID NOT PROTECT THEIR COMPANIES & STOCK HOLDERS, INSTEAD WENT AFTER THE FAST BUCK. HE WAS AGAINST THE SEC OR THE FEDERAL RESERVE REGULATING DERIVATIVES, THAUGHT THE DEALERS WOULD REGULATE THEMSELVES. DERIVATES ARE JUST PAPER, OR BETER YET A PONZY SCHEME. I BELEIVE THE FACE VALUE OF DERIVATIVES IN EXISTANCE ARE WORTH ABOUT 100 TRILLION DOLLARS, WHICH IS ABOUT 3 TIMES THE WHOLE WORLDS ECONOMY. WHAT'S BACKING THEM."
2,Baldwin 3543.150 Laguna Double-Post Tissue Holder Satin Nickel,"I actually returned this item. I've bought Baldwin products in the past and the actual tissue holder, i.e. the the metal item, is fine but the screws & mechanism to hang it on your wall was faulty or not there. I gave this to our carpenter who can literally do anything and he couldn't make it work. So my complaint is not so much the product as the mounting materials."
2,not good,"This product did not seem to work at all. The dots were all weird and funny looking. Maybe dried out? Heat damaged while shipping?? GOOD NEWS..the company completely refunded my money,promptly. I would buy from the company that sold them again. They were a class act, even if the actual product seemed defective."
1,NORMALLY WORKS THIS DOES NOT,I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL AND THEY USED THIS PRODUCT ALL THE TIME. THIS BOX DOES NOT WORK. I WASTED MONEY. I HAVE TRIED TO GET MY MONEY BACK AND RETURN THEM BUT TO NO AVAIL. I THINK THE PRODUCT MUST HAVE SAT AROUND IN A WAREHOUSE IN EITHER EXTREME HEAT OR COLD.
1,DOA,"First of all, they were ruined in shipping - the max storage temperature is 86 degrees F and it was a sunny day. All of the little dots were blue. Even if they had worked properly, they wouldn't have worked for us. An underarm temperature takes 3 minutes and an oral temperature takes 1 minute. My kids are too little to hold a thermometer in position that long."
5,another excellent book from John C. Maxwell,"The Choice is Yours is not only a great book to give to a graduate, but an excellent book for leaders. It has great insights in making the right choices. Maxwell fills this book with quotes, and stories that will make it difficult for the reader to put the book down. He is an awesome author on leadership. I have most of his books, and tapes, and this one was a must to add to the collection."
2,So So book,"The content was a bit to religous for me. Good points, but with too much emphasis on Christianity. Thats fine, but not in a book about being sensational at age 60. I am sorry I purchased it."
2,"Uncomfortable, not the usual DP quality either.","I wanted a red patent shoe and I love wedges and Donald Pliner. I must say though, it is the first DP pair of shoes that is completely uncomfortable, and not up to par with the usual quality. Made in Spain, not Italy like most DP shoes. I had a cobbler stretch these and break them in a bit but it did not help much. The ties do not hold your heel in very well and my heel lifts out when I walk."
5,Very Informative,I bought this because After Effects is a complicated program. This instructional dvd covers everything you need to know. You also work along with the narrator.
2,Belt clip causes the case to release!,"This would be a really great case--it fits snugly around your iPod and looks great. If you're looking for something to just slip in your pocket, and that lets you see your iPod through, it probably won't even be an issue. Attaching the belt clip to the case will actually cause it to pop open, and if you're not careful your iPod falling to the ground. The belt clip is in no way useful--it actually causes more problems than anything else."
1,Don't waste your money,"I almost lost my 60GB iPod using this case. As other reviewers have noted, the case does not close securely over the product it is advertised to fit! I had it on my belt while mowing. The iPod fell out onto the ground. If I had not slammed on the tractor brakes, I would have run over an iPod that cost me $399. In my opinion, the case is poorly designed and the hard plastic cannot stretch the way leather can. I'm going back to a leather case. BTW, I did run over half of the plastic case so the rest went into the trash can - $20 wasted."
5,An extremely entertaining and engaging book of film trivia.,"What a great idea! ""What's That From?: The Ultimate Quiz Book of Contemporary Movie Lines"" is a wonderful compilation of movie quotes that bring you back to great movie moments. The book is fun to read on one's own and even more fun when quizzing friends with trivia questions that tickle the corners of the brain. This book is wonderful for any movie buff!"
2,Disappointed,"This was not at all what I expected. The format is a bit confusing at first, and the the fact that not one line listed under Mel Brooks was ever spoke by him in a movie just set me off. He wrote the lines, but that's not the point.In addition, many of the lines are so generic/obscure as to be pointless, uninteresting and thus no fun. There is some interesting stuff, but when we played guessing games from it over the holidays, we quickly lost interest. I would not recommend this book and hope that there is something better out there."
5,Must read for movie fans,"The must read sleeper of the year! Every movie fan of Generation X will thoroughly enjoy this unique, hilarious compilition of movie quotes. My friends and I sit around the diner and quiz each other all the time on movie quotes. Now we have a resource to settle our late night cinematic disputes. From the old standards to the most obscure funny lines, Jai has them all"
3,not for kids,"I love movie trivia, and this book is packed with fun stuff. However, prospective buyers need to know that this book contains quotes which contain very foul language and subjects. So, do not make the mistake I made when I bought this book for my kids to read during family drives. It would be great if the author could issue a newer edition with more recent trivia and omission of unecessary nastiness. There are plenty of memorable movie lines out there without needing to use ones with F-bombs and the like. Otherwise highly recommended."
3,Effective prayer life,My wife and mother in law love it. It is for Christians. We bought a second copy. That should say it all.
5,Nice Scent,I love it. very nice Scent. quick deleviry I will recommend this product to any one who loves a good scent
1,Not the best,"This instructional video actually has very little instruction. There's a lot of dead-time involving footage of riders just riding, without explanation of what they are doing and why they are doing it. Donnie only explains the obvious things that any experienced rider can already see. He doesn't talk about the little important things that advanced riders do, which are difficult to see on video. Donnie shares very little 'advanced' (which IS the name of video) information in this video. I didn't get any value from purchasing and watching it. I wish I could return it."
4,Good,Thought I would give this a try and I am very happy with it. Brings back a lot of memories and is very nice to listen to.
3,Its ok.,"It's ok, and just ok, lots of selections, so good for skipping around a bit, but not for listening to tune after tune."
4,ok,"good but not as good as the ""best classical in the world"". You have to be prepared that these are like greatest hits selections. Still it's nice, as they say, very relaxing."
5,SOOTHING,Bought this to soothe and relax me in times when I am stressed. It does all that and is a wonderful collection of classical music. Highly recommend.
4,A credible Baroque montage,A lovely mostly Baroque montage with recognizable favorites including classical pieces from Mozart and Beethoven.
3,very soothing music,I probably did not read the description well enough. This cd is not my taste in music. I have not found anything want to download to my kindle yet. I probably will eventually pick a couple of selections.
2,Good,"Good CD, and good styles of music in the pieces, but isn't particularly my type of music. I like guitar more."
2,bad batch of CDs,loved music... BUT... first CD didn't play all songs... returned to Amazon... thank you Amazon... and the replacement has similar problems... will have to return itMaybe it's just a bad batch. Other disc by manufacturer Denon were just fine
5,Most Relaxing Classical Music in Universe,Purchased one in a local store and a second online for a co-workeras a b-day gift. Beautiful muscic in this cd.
5,Fabulous music,Bought for my new grandson but i will be listening too; beautiful music. very pleased this is a 2 cd set
5,So wonderful classical music,"For casual or serious classical music customers, this is a perfect mix of outstanding classical selections."
5,LOVE IT!!!!,I play these cds for my children several times a day and they love it!!! Wonderful music all in one purchase.
3,Boring,"If by ""relaxing,"" you are looking to fall asleep, then this is the music for you. This compilation is so boring that it will put you to sleep!"
3,Great CD,"oops posted the wrong review for the wrong CD :). This one of course was a great CD, how can it not be - it's classic."
2,Stress-freedom,"Perfect music to end the work day. After listening to this I can face the evening. If the morning is hard, a little at lunch time gets me through the afternoon."
3,Art Rock Review lV,"This is a mere rating for those of you that might have be into art rock music,Yes,Tangerine Dream,Rick Wakeman,Mike Oldfield, looking for something a bit on the classical side, to relax to, and quite possibly enjoy.Having come from a family of piano teachers and knowing before hand alot of Bach, and others who have several classics on this double cd.I have to admit that the 2nd cd( side 2) is better than the first, but that is just my thoughts.Had I a little more insight I might had passed this cd up, and went out and boughtRick Wakeman Night airs, or Wakeman & Wakeman, for the type of classical music I was looking for.If your my dad's age of Seventy something and your much into the old classics I think this cd might just be for you, but if your like me, and into art rock music, looking for a Sunday morning relaxing piece, look futher, or piece together something yourself.Hope this helps in your knowledge for a taste of the most relaxing classical music in the universe."
2,Not Very Informative or Entertaining,"Oliver belives that fascinating stories lie behind many terms and phrases in our language; his objectives are to inform and entertain with this material.The material is grouped by topic - eg. Food and Drink, Military, Sports and Games, Law and (dis)Order, Religion, etc. Some examples follow.""Caesar's Salad"" - not named after the Roman leader, but a 1924 innovation by Chef Caesar in an Italian Restaurant in Tijuana.""Foot the Bill"" - originally a 15th century term meaning to add up all the components and total them at the foot (bottom) of a bill.""Boycott"" - came from people agreeing to abstain from contact with a very disliked Captain Boycott during the late 19th century while land reform was underway.Unfortunately, overall Oliver failed to achieve his objectives. The first because, seemingly more often than not, he was unable to explain a phrase or term's origin; as a result, the interestingness of the material also suffered."
3,Machete Joe,"What I can say about this movie is the acting was very good. Not cheesy. It is a movie within a movie as it is all about a film crew filming a movie about said ""Machete Joe"". It takes place at a castle that appeared to me to be pulled right out of a Dracula movie circa 1930s only with electricity. The gore factor is pretty scarce, at least for me anyway. I am not sorry I purchased the movie but I will not keep it as I would not take the time to rewatch it over and over like a lot of movies in my collection. For me, it is NOT a keeper. Don't pay more than $10 for it if you do buy it and that includes shipping cost. It is worth watching once to say you have seen it but you won't be discussing it further with anyone if you know what I mean. NOT discussion worthy!!!!"
4,"A fun read, if a little too ""Clever""","Mollod and Tesauro have done it again; a sharp, witty look at what gents 'should' and 'should not' be doing in searching, meeting, wooing, and keeping. About 1/2 of the sentences in this cook are similes, another 1/4 are metaphors. Here and there exist a few *truly* clever, witty gems. (If the ""witty banter"" in shows like ""The Gilmore Girls"" drives you nuts, this is NOT a book you'll enjoy.) A number of topics are explored, some of them more mundane than others. Overall, most of Mollod and Tesauro's advice is sage; guidance for making informed choices, and answers to minor-detail questions abound.Recipes for adult beverages are peppered throughout the pages, often named or themed alongside the topic at hand-- however they contain no measurements, so proportions for making these drinks may require a certain amount of speculation or experimentation.A fun read for both men and women."
5,where do I get hold of the CD?,"If it is sung by various artists and has a little baby on the front, where on earth do I obtain it on CD - to play in my car?"
3,Mistakes and insufficient information,"There are quite a few typos in this book, some of which are quite frustrating - it's hard to find a hike when the street names in the directions are incorrect. Additionally, the information given on the hikes is insufficent for us retentive types. Elevation gains aren't given (you have to guess what ""moderate"" means), maps don't include segment lengths, and sometimes the maps aren't very detailed.That said, it's the only hiking book centered on Nashville, and it includes a good selection. Do be aware that many of the hikes are short, and whether they're worth the drive from Nashville is a toss-up - but that's the nature of the hikes within 60 miles of town."
3,sadly there are not subtitles,"I grew up watching fantomas, great, clean, old fashion action flick, sadly this version doesn't have any subtitles and I cant understand French."
3,"First Movie was awesome, the two others really lame.","For this review I'm not talking about the OBVIOUSLY outdated action and gadgets elements but just taking into account the story and characters.Well the first Fantomas was great and I'd gadly give it 4 or 5 stars but the two others were REALLY lame and boring to a point that I had to fast-forward most of it. A big waste of time and horrible acting with the most ridiculous story I've ever seen, seemed like written by a 5 year old.Just watch the first one and toss the other two in the garbage where they belong."
3,Good Movie with Lousy Features,I love the movie but really wish they had included either English or German subtitles so I could actually understand all the speaking parts so because of that I can only give it 3 stars. Hard to believe that this day and age a DVD only comes in one language which is really lame.
4,Nice indoor tripod,This tripod is a good buy for the money but do not use it outside as I would worry about the stability in a windy environment.
4,"Light weight, light touch","It seems good. The feel is that of a fluid head, but quite light - it glides instead of sticking. My only complaint is that the lever is on the left and my right-handedness doesn't like that."
4,comfy and cheap,You cannot beat the price and the item is comfortable. Also colors stay put despite being laundered many times (with bleach!)Runs a little too big. I normally wear 8 or 9 and these size 8's are on a large side.
1,Don't Buy,These are not normal. Don't waste your money. Poor quality and not a good fit. Not sure what went wrong with these underwear.
4,Cute colors,"I got these for the colors/pattern, and they are indeed cute. Material seems thin though and a bit rougher than other cotton panties. But for the price, still a good deal."
2,Weird fit,"These were purchased to advoid hitting a fresh c-section scar. I purchased a size 7 which is equivalent to a large according to the size chart even though I'm usually a medium because I wanted the extra room. The first pair out of the package (a white pair) fit exactly how I wanted them to. However subsequent pairs (all the color ones) from he very same package are a snugger. Not so tight that they're unusable since I am a medium to begin with, but tight enough that they're not fufilling their original intent."
3,I don't like these,"The elastic is scratchy and uncomfortable, but I think I just ordered the wrong kind. I thought I was getting the ones with the covered elastic, but this isn't them."
1,Poor quality,These briefs are no longer US-made as they used to be. Quality and colours are now very poor. I'm quite unsatisfied.
2,Disappointed,"I have always purchased hanes cotton hi-cut however the quality of this latest package stinks. After one washing, the elastic around the waist is already unravelling. Maybe because they are not made in Thailand????? I will never purchase them again."
2,dissapointed,"I just gor this product, although it was good quality, it was huge. i ordered size 8 following amazon size chart, but i was surprised when i opened the bag, and yes, it was size 8 but that size stands for XL, when i actually wear M. dissapointing..."
2,poor quality,"Looks bad after the first wash. Does not dry. Otherwise, it would be nice - if you use it for decoration only (and never wash it or use it). I bought it to match the curtain that I like."
1,Horrible fitting shoe,"I have a couple pair of KC Reaction shoes. They are fine. I wear a 8.5 in those. I ordered an 8.5 in this shoe and it fit me more like a 9.5. The sizing is horrible, thus that's why they are probably clearing it out on all online stores.So I sent the shoes back, and got a half size smaller at a local store (Nordstrom Rack). They were STILL too big. Don't buy this shoe unless you are ok with a sloppy fit shoe."
1,Doesn't fit!!!,"I attempted to install this block heater in my 2001 Nissan Xterra 3.3L V6, and carefully followed the instructions on the Kat's website, but this block heater will NOT fit into the engine at the location they specify (left rear frost plug, according to their application guide). The 30mm diameter was correct, but the heater was approximately 2mm too deep to fit into the block without interference with the cylinder wall. This caused a LOT of frustration due to the extremely difficult access to the frost plug of the installation, and then have to install a new frost plug back into place when it didn't fit. Don't purchase this unless you know for a FACT that this will fit your engine, because the manufacturer's application guide is NOT always correct."
2,Waste of Time...,"This book drifted well below my expectations. I guess I figured that the writing would be entertaining and happily stimulating, not slow paced, in parts, and on the verge of depressing in others. And, why classify the book as erotica just because genitalia is mentioned here or there? Most of the stories weren't even that erotic. Give me a break! In fairness, the quality of the writing is up to par, and a select few of the tales are actually enjoyable. BUT, if you are looking for a book full of saucy stories for a long soak in the tub, think twice about this one."
5,this is the real black erotica,"simply put this is the best as wellas diverse collection of writing i've read in awhile....it's great !! especially ""when starngers meet"" by rs adams"
5,A Wonderful Collection !,"This was a wonderful collection!A collection of 19 stories from today's most gifted black male writers. Each story stirs arousing seduction, erotic fantasy, adventure and the chase of new romance while some have exotic locations to feed the spice. I found this collection a wonderful read. Very tasteful erotica.The stories sizzle, smoke, burn. I tip my hat to the men in this collection. I was left wanting more..reviewed by:Dawn"
1,"OPINION OF THE BOOK ""AFTER HOURS""","The book was in excellent condition, however the contents of the book was boring and disappointing. It was supposed to be erotic writings by black men but I didn't find the stories erotic at all. I purchased one for my sister and one for my sister-in-law as well and they were equally disappointed in the book."
4,"Kudos, Robert Fleming!","So what are the brothers writing? Check some them out in After Hours edited by Robert Fleming!It was difficult not to flip to the short stories written by author I knew, but I did. Their stories were masterfully written! It was somewhat surprising to see names of authors who I thought would never be in such an anthology. Further analysis of a few of their submission showed ""entry level"" writing on such subjects. I applaud their efforts and I expect to see them involved in similar writing projects in the future.Veteran and up coming writing-brothers gave readers and eye full of talent as not seen in their previous works...of course. Authors like Kenji Jasper, Eric Pete and Brian Egeston wrote stories of thought, mystery and comical wit. Bravo bruthas!Kudos to Robert Fleming who has selected a variety of talented African American male writers from various literary genres and given them the opportunity write like they never have before...erotic! -LC"
1,The Worst Book,This book will leave you wanting to scream at the publisher who decided it was a good idea to print this junk! Do yourself a favor and do not buy or even borrow this trash. It was a very depressing and disappointing read.
5,"like it or not, we see the world through car windows",Some people may miss the point of these pictures as they are subtle. They speak to our condition as a people and the condition of our spaces. These are great pictures which will touch the soul of anyone who has spent time driving the west.
2,Traditional praise and worship,I was hoping for a more contemporary style; gave it away.If you all can recommend a more contemporary CD by Vineyardplease let me know.
3,"Pleasant album, but it's not the classic sound","This live album is by a reformed 90s version of Pentangle that is fronted by Jacqui McShee, although other seminal members of the band's classic lineup (Jansch, Renbourn, etc.) are absent. The songs here, which include both new and classic material, are pleasant enough-- although Pentangle fans will notice that the sound has changed somewhat. It's become jazzier due to the presence of a sax player and a rhythm section that seems more inclined to groove-- and there are actually one or two songs that are jazzy torch songs, without any real folk evidence at all. (Most other tracks, though, still show the heavy folk influence). I can't honestly recommend this to someone who's unfamiliar with Pentagle-- just because it's not really representative of the band's over all sound, but confirmed fans will find it interesting. (In fact, the version of ""Cruel Sister"" here is sure to delight.)"
5,An excellent resource,"As a professional horticulturist gardening in zones 5 through 7, I have searched high and low for a good reference book on tropical and subtropical plants. At last I have found it!Hot Plants for Cool Climates is informative, interesting and well-organized. The design suggestions are new and exciting, and the encyclopedia is stuffed with detailed information regarding cultivation. Particularly helpful were the cultivar names listed under each species (god help me, how did they ever whittle down the list under Coleus?) and the overwintering tips.Serious amateurs and professionals alike will benefit from owning this book."
2,What might have been...,"First the positive, I love the idea for the film (think Royal Tenenbaums meets The Bucket List) and obviously the landscape is beautiful. Also, there are some really nice moments with the main character Ben. My two main issues with this movie (because there were more) is lack of chemistry between Ben and his girlfriend and then there's the narrator... who talks to much. Not good. Had there been some interesting people he met along the way I could have forgiven the gf issue, but that didn't happen. And had Joshua Jackson been able to get a word in edgewise maybe we would have felt more for the characters, but I'm pretty sure he couldn't even save this film."
1,No thank you.,"I was really looking forward to watching this after all the great reviews it has received, but I just wasted an hour and a half. It wasn't the story that I didn't like, I get it, searching for the meaning and what truly matters in life...but come on. It was so slow moving. I liked that it showed how he impacted the people he met along the way, even thought that was minimal. And the 'romance' in this movie claims to have, is no where to be found. Even though I like Joshua Jackson, I still think this movie was a waste of time."
1,"The most horrible, boring movie I have ever seen.","If you like watching a guy on a motorcycle drive across Canada and than sleep with someone when he is engaged to be married then this movie is for you. This movie was Not rated but, should have been rated at least a PG-13. I would never waste my time watching this show. Absolutely horrible."
4,Joshua Jackson Delivers,"This quiet, thoughtful movie was a lovely surprise. Sweet and sad, but uplifting, not a ""Hollywood"" movie (a Canadian movie for sure). If you are a fan of Jackson you will not be disappointed. He is an accomplished actor. The voice over seems a little odd and too familiar, but as the movie goes on it grows on you. The narration ties up nicely at the end. Wonderful photography. Not a ""tissue"" movie, no tearjerking moments, for me at least. Quite satisfied with the time spent. Oddly reminds me of ""Joshua Then and Now"", but I'm not sure why. Maybe Jackson is our generation's Alan Arkin."
2,Love Story meets Motorcycle Diaries,"This movie right from the get-go is extremely hard to take seriously for the simple reason that nobody in the history of the human race acts like these people do. I would've liked a real discussion about alternative cancer therapies, many which seem to work. But instead the main character travels the length of Canada with apparently no monetary considerations at all, one time staying at a $300 a night hotel. Also on his travels he encounters the Stanley Cup, in which he kisses and a NHL player. Also he gets into a motorcycle accident and like the old T.V. Show ""Miami Vice,"" there wasn't even a scratch on him. That was kind of funny. In fact the movie is so bad that's its good in a certain way. Certainly the picture postcard view of Canada is a delight, although one tends to remember that not all of Canada is picturesque. I would rate this movie a 1 1/2 because I didn't walk out on it, but I thought about it many times."
1,m-town,"I was really expecting to love this movie, but as hard as I tried to enjoy it, I simply couldn't. The main character is incredibly narcissistic and treats people (especially his girlfriend) so badly, it's hard to stomach as a viewer. The narrator in the background is beyond ridiculous and the numerous shots of the main character on the motorcycle get very old."
1,"interesting concept, poorly done","This movie looked interesting and had an interesting plot, but, it didnt live up to it. It was boring, I didn't care about the characters and the story had no development. I thought there would be some great revelation or lesson, I was waiting for a plot twist, but in the end there was nothing. Dont waste your time."
1,trash,"screenwriter has no grasp of english language. tries to show off lexicon but makes blunders. many words do not fit intended meaning.worst strike of movie is that they have a picture of jesus on the the cross, and jesus is giving someone the middle finger. i'm no holy roller, but how bad is that?finally, movie is scatterbrained about narrative. jumps randomly from one idea to another, extremely choppy.had to abandon half-way thru"
4,I enjoyed this gentle little film,"Joshua Jackson's understated performance and the stunning Canadian scenery are worth the watch. I enjoyed every minute. It diddn't feel like there was one false note. Being a huge Fringe fan it suddenly occurred to me to find out what else Joshua Jackson had done besides Dawson's Creek and Fringe and found this charming movie. If you're wondering if you'll regret spending the time to watch it - you won't. If nothing else you'll say ""OH MY WORD, I have to go to Banff!"" ...and you'll wish there was a soundtrack available..."
3,"Good acting, story, and dialogue","I'd like to give this 3 1/2 stars. Unlike most independent films, this one went somewhere and the story had a point. There was no aimless meandering or unrealistic dialogue. It was intelligent also. It explored the theme of growing up and losing enchantment with the world and the theme of love and marriage. Good acting also. The main character was realistic and likeable, not a buffoon like in a lot of movies.The downsides were that it wasn't all that exciting or entertaining, although of course that was not really their goal."
3,Description doesn't match the movie,"Well, this movie starts out with the ""you are going to die soon"" scene. Not much of a romance either. A fair ""on the road"" and ""find yourself"" movie. Marginally recommended, but not as a movie that made me feel good."
4,Nice trip,"I really enjoyed this movie. It did start out a little stronger than it ended but I think it's worth seeing. Great soundtrack, too."
4,Really good movie,This movie touched me in my soul. I am a cancer survivor and when I was diagnosed if I had a means to do so I would have done exactly what he did. The scenery is beautiful and the acting is good. Some parts are sad. Some parts are funny. I enjoyed it immensely. I highly recommend.
4,An unexpected surprise!,"I saw Joshua Jackson's name & being a Fringe devotee, decided to move out of my usual genre & take a chance on this film. Glad I did - I found it to be thought provoking & inspirational. May we all find our own ""Grumps""."
5,Amazing movie!!,"Honestly one of the best movies I have ever seen. Loved, loved, loved it!! If you enjoy well-done indie movies you will love it as well. The story is great, the scenery is beautiful, the soundtrack is perfect. No room for improvement at all. If you are Amazon Prime, you have to take advantage of seeing this while it's free."
2,New Narrator please!,The voice over totally wrecks it for me. Try a woman with an english accent. Much more pleasant! Not sure I can finish it.
4,good for the heart. exciting for the mind.,"SO i went into this movie with no expectations. Turned out to be quite a wonderful flick. between the story and the fascination the viewer somehow gets with the bike, i felt really really good after watching this. I am going to do something worthwhile with life...starting now. Enjoy!"
2,Just okay,"This was slow going all the way, beautiful scenery, but kind of a boring movie. Never got my interest, hard to follow at times, was a different ending. I wished they had added alittle more into the ending."
3,Current songs with a more upbeat beat.,I like this Cd. It has songs on here I normally dont like...Chasing Cars for example..the original for me is BORING..the remix here fantastic. Back to Black...please no Amy Winhouse song sounds good even remixed by Almighty. Overall I like the CD and play it pretty regular.
2,NOT Fermented Cod Liver Oil,"It's OK. The reason I can't say better is because I was very specifically looking for Fermented CLO and this appears in the search results. After reading the description, it doesn't specifically say fermented but it is ""olde world"". In the ""Olde World"" CLO was always fermented, so I assumed wrongly that was what they meant.I took the entire bottle as directed without noticing any positive results. I've since switched to Green Pastured FCLO and was shocked with a noticeable difference within 2 days,which have only gotten better over the past few weeks. This product didn't hurt/help, so I can't recommend."
1,LEFT ME FEELING SICK,I think this product is contaminated or something. I tried if for a few days and was feeling very sick. Then I waited a week and tried it again and that sick stomach feeling just kept comming back. I dont know if there are chemicals in this or what but I never get sick like this. I just threw it away since I could not return it.
1,Best Brand of Cod Liver Oil on the market,"If you are looking for a liquid Cod Liver Oil, this is the best. It has a lemon flavoring. I like it and I don't like fish! That says something.I meant for this to be a 5-star rating, but can't see how to change it!"
5,to my surprise doesn't taste bad,"actually doesn't taste like much, maybe slightly lemon. the only thing you should be aware of, if it gets on your hands, they will smell fishy but you don't taste it."
5,Great product! Great price!,This is good-tasting cod liver oil with added vitamin D. I have used it for the past few months and am very satisfied with it. The price is lower than other brands of cod liver oil and I like the fact that I don't have to purchase vitamin D separately to take with it.
5,Brilliant!!,This is what will always remain as good from the musically amazing 70's. So much good music and so little time. Check this out if you value innovation.
2,"I didn't know ""Cinnabar"" meant cheap plastic...","I recently purchased three Sajen pieces, two of them were beautiful, and then there was this one. The silverwork and the garnet were both really nice. It was the Cinnabar Heart that ruined the piece for me. I was picturing a carved stone with at least a slight bit of visual texture. Cinnabar (the mineral) should be very refractive unless it is purposely dulled. This is very, very dull cinnabar. This looked like a very matte wax, something that would be decorative on a candle. It will be pretty enough as long as no one looks too closely at it, but overall, I'm far from thrilled with this piece."
3,OK pendant,"This is a big pendant. I didn't find it as pretty as the picture, as the cinnabar really overpowers the whole pendant. Also, cinnabar is completely opaque and looks like solidified play dough which I didn't know. It is an OK pendant, but would have been nicer if it was smaller."
4,the wedding planners daughter,IT IS A GREAT BOOK. IT HAS A GIRL AND HER NAME IS WILLFRED WILLA FOR SHORT.HER MOM DOES NOT WANT WILLA TO GO TO THE WEDDINGS. HER DAD DIED AFTER THEIR WEDDING.(ON THE HONEYMOON). THE BOOK IS REALY GOOD. IF YOU THINK YOU WILL LIKE IT READ IT.
5,For my daughter,My daughter absolutely loves this series of books. Every time a new one is published she can't wait to get it.
2,uggg!!,"THis book was not that interesting. I am an 11 year old fifth grader and i didn't like the language in here or some of the elements that come up. it's main idea is Ok, but for some younger readers, they wouldnt' understand it.You're probably then wondering why i rated it 2 stars... I gave it that instead of 1 because it gives a good message of friendship and loyalty in it.This deserved two starts and just barely that."
5,Beautiful Book,"This book ""The Wedding Planners Daughter"" is where it all starts willa or as her mom named her willafred havisham when she was born she had a dad but then when he gave willa's mom stella a card saying to come to the park on their honeymoon she came and started waiting and waiting then suddenly a police officer came and told her that her husband had died on being on a hot air balloon so since that day willa's mom never wanted to love again. But willa in the other hand wanted a father really bad and so then a poet moved in next door and he was willas english teacher. he seemed extremely nice and on open house he and stella saw each others eyes and willa seemed happy and well to read it more Will the poet ""Sam"" be willa's dad???"
5,A Great Book,I loved this book very much. I wish it didn't have to end! It was so great and I loved it. It was a pleasure to read it.
3,Be prepared to do more research,The information in this book is O.K. It is very very basic. It is one of the first farm books I bought; I thought it would have everything I needed all in one book - I was very wrong. I ended up buying books dedicated to each of the subjects addressed in this book to find much more detailed and helpful information.
5,Wonderful!,"Anyone living in the country, considering raising ANY animals, should have this guide handy! Maybe have it as a resource for every family! It is packed with information, practical suggestions, additional resources, appropriate language, and practical sense. We already have one beef cow (bred) and working on a nice chicken coop!"
4,Backyard Barnyard,"Being a newbie re: chickens, etc. I don't believe my assessment of this book could possibly be as accurate andcredible as one written by someone who really ""knows their stuff""! It has to be good. I know so little to begin with.In my opinion, it seems to be well written and illustrated and is all new info to me."
5,great book,"This is a wonderful book for those wanting to learn about raising animals in the backyard, which is becoming more popular"
5,Fantastic!,This book tells you everything you need to know for the novice to the experienced. Suggestions for those who want ornamental animals to the getting down to farming people. Pictures are great. Highly suggest this book!
3,Shipper was great book was a let down,The shipper was great ... on time and product as discribed.Only draw back was the content of the book itself. I read manyreviews that said the book was great and all you would need.However it was very general and concerning the differant breeds ofcritters very general and did not even cover the more popular ones.I really dont understand how this book has the ratings that it does.I already knew more than the book contained from articles off the internet.
4,great book!,This book works great and spells everything out very easily. Not the most comprehensive I am sure but I actually learned alot from it. I was mostly interested in chicken and sheep as well as ducks and geese. great book for a beginner like myself.
5,highly recommended,"You can't get all-inclusive with this many species in one book, but this book comes awfully close. An amazing introduction to basic animal care. Definitely check this out *before* you bring home those cute chicks, or rabbits, or goats! Also excellent for cattle (beef and dairy) and more!"
3,not enough diagrams,"however this book is helpful with raising cattle traditionally, it is not for the organic fully grass fed animal. I live in Hawaii where its all grass fed food here, so maybe im bias, but it didnt suit my needs because i would never consult a vet for any ilness. A natural animal is just that !"
5,Amazing book with tons of information!,This is an outstanding book like no other. I was particularly interested in the rabbit section seeing as I own one and this was a full complete guide. If you are interested in raising rabbits or just simply have 1 this is an amazing book for you. I also thoroughly enjoyed Storey's Guide to Raising Rabbits. I highly recommend this book.
5,Deceivingly easy,"After reading all of the various reviews online for this tool I decided to go ahead and purchase it. I figured, it was less expensive than having a plumber come out and do this. When the part arrived, I quickly opened it, read the little insert on how to use the tool and went to go unclog the toilet.It actually took me more time to unpack the tool from the shipping box than it did to unclog the toilet (all in ~15 seconds). As some others noted the tool is a bit lengthy when fully extended. I am 5'10"" and it just about reached the limit of my armspan.I couldn't be more happy with this purchase."
5,NO PLUMBER NECESSARY! SAVE YOUR $$$!,"If the plunger, dishwashing liquid, bleach, fishing, etc, doesn't work don't worry. Save your money and just buy this product. No plumber necessary. It saved me plenty and pays for itself after the first use. Can't be more happy with this product. Very easy to use too. And if you're military/Veteran, you can also get it at Home Depot and get 10% off your bill. OH YEAH! ;)"
5,Easy to use toilet unstopper tool,"I was having to pay $70 to $80 per hour for a plumber every time my toilet backed up and a plunger didn't work. It is a very well made, sturdy tool. It is very easy to use."
5,Should have bought this sooner>,"After 2 plumber visits within 9 months to unclog toilets costing more than $400, I decided I could do this myself if I only had the right tool. Best decision I ever made."
5,Ridgid 3 ft Toilet Auger with bulb head,Perfect solution to a recent stoppage. My 2 year old granddaughter somehow dropped a brand new bar of soap in the toilet and flushed it. We have a pressure-assist toilet so I knew it was deep into the toilet's base. When the auger arrived I went to work only to hit something hard 2 ft into the toilet. After cranking handle repeatedly the bulb brought a clump of soap. A few more tries and it punched a hole in the bar. Eventually I was able to push the rest of the bar out of the base.Great product. I'm sure I'll need it again.
3,Lots of food for thought,"Because I didn't know much about Jewish thought, I selected this book out of many because of keywords related to Kabbalah, ritual, mysticism as well as many known biblical characters. I found what I was promised, lots of rules of behavior, unexpected and touching humanity. The style of writing is easy to read, with much specificity and explanations. Very helpful basic resource for the uninitiated."
4,action movie great story,"Movie made before vulgar language and sex became the selling point. Mel Gibson is so youngIn this I hardly recognized him. Hard to find movies that both my husband and I enjoy, but this definitely made the grade."
3,"good seller, product as described with fast shipping.","This was recommended by the beauty shop I frequent and certainly does ""freeze fix"" my hair which is great if you will be indoors most of the time. The only problem comes if you have to spend any amount of time outside in the wind. The hairdo sort of goes to pot and is hard to get back under control because of the stiffness of your hair. The spray bottle is only 3 ounces but just a small puff holds your hair."
3,Reading comics on a computer screen is not awesome,"If you're in the place I was before purchasing this CD-ROM collection, you're asking yourself whether or not you're going to enjoy reading comics on your computer screen, in an Adobe Acrobat format. Well, if you're also like me in that you have a small laptop, I think the answer is ""not really.' I certainly got my money's worth in time spent reading, as I couldn't breeze through the thing like I would in trades, but by issue 20-something the constant clicking and dragging started to grate on me, and I gave up. If you have a huge computer screen, or if the money aspect is that appealing (let's face it, that's a lot for $20), then go for it. For the Wednesday lovers like me, however, this format feels not ready for prime time."
3,"Great deal, one compromise","This is of course, a wonderful way to pick up a huge span of X-Men comics. I have only one big gripe and that every page is stamped with a ""Marvel"" logo. Excuse me, did I not just buy these? Watermarks are for shareware and public resources, not something that I bought. I understand it's to prevent copyright infringement, but the logo is neither small nor unobtrusive. It is large and in the center of each page. Ridiculous.I won't be buying another product like this from Marvel."
4,You can't beat a paper comic book in your hands,"I love X-men, but it's a bit of a struggle trying to read it on my computer or laptop. The constant scrolling, ugh. I prefer the book series or comics, if available."
5,Ultimate X-Men Complete Comic Book Collection on cd-rom,Looks brand new- but haven't opened it yet. More than 70 comic books on these cd-roms. Had I purchased the comic books it would have cost more than $210.00 so I'm very happy to be able to read the coolest x-men comic book title. All the comics in a row from February 2001 thru May 2006. Plus it's nice to be able to read many issues one after the other at one sitting; instead of waiting for one story every month. I can read a year's worth of comic books in one sitting this way.
2,ick,"Smarmy new-age mush, noodly and squishy. It's too bad they used the synth--without that it might have been worth listening to. As is, it only seems useful as elevator music. Check out Rampal's exquisite, crisp, clean interpretations of Japanese flute music instead."
4,sounds of japan,being a lover of good music i was surprised to see this cd. i listened to some of the selections and decided this was an excellent piece for my parents. being of japanese descent i am always looking for music from japan to enhance my cultural appreciation. my parents truly love this cd.
5,wonderfully pleasant,"Quiet, relaxing , pleasant, interesting, and a treat to the ear.This is my first Galway cd, and I'm impressed with it, I will probably be buying more."
3,Quirky Fit,"These work well if you don't mind sticking them to the metal frame above the door. If you are like myself and wish to stick them to the plastic trim, the bottom edge comes down too far and catches the window and mirror frame. I trimmed about 1/4"" of material from the entire length of the bottom edge and then stuck them on the plastic doorframe trim. They fit and work well even with the slight modification. If you don't want to modify them or stick them to the metal frame...don't buy them. Mine look decent and are functional. I would buy them again if I needed to."
2,"Eh, they weren't worth my money.",I wasn't impressed with these. They were left with rough edges on the lower side that can cut the crap out of you if you aren't careful when getting out of the car. They crack VERY easy (mine cracked 3 friggin' times on the driver side on install!). I was gentle and cracked it when I was merely pressing down to secure the adhesive. The front side started pulling off of the car shortly after a few washes. I'd recommend another company.
3,"Nice, but.....","Having University of Wisconsin ties makes me like this watch alot, but within the first two wearings the pin holding the watch face to the clip-on portion of the watch fell out. I was lucky enough to have the watch fall in my lap rather than on the ground and be lost forever! The pin was also something that isn't readily available at stores and we had to find a watch/clock speciality store in order to get the pin replaced! Watch works well, but that pin issue was annoying."
2,Didn't Last a Year,"Ordered these just over a year ago and put them in rotation with other similar glasses. Unfortunately, all but one of these didn't last the year. Long cracks appeared in each glass, usually beginning at the bottom. I don't have a dishwasher so all cleaning was done by hand with sponges and cloth. At the same time I purchased these, I picked up some similar size and shape glasses from a value big-box store. They were $1.00 each and I still have all of them. Save your money and look elsewhere."
5,The only recording to have of the Rachmaninov Sonata No. 2,"The Rachmaninov was recorded live in Moscow around the time of Cliburn's triumph in the first ever Tchaikovsky competition. It captures the pianist at his absolute peak. Cliburn had both the temperament and the pianistic ability to bring out the romantic yearning and the dizzying virtuosity of this ne plus ultra of piano sonatas. To make things even better, he plays the original 1913 version (with just a few alterations) rather than the emasculated 1931 revision. No other pianist (not even Horowitz) has approached Cliburn's achievement here.However, DO NOT buy this CD. Instead, go to Cliburn's entry in Philips' ""Great Pianists of the 20th Century"" series, where this recording of the Sonata is joined by Cliburn's supreme reading of Rachmaninov's Third Concerto. (The Prokofiev on the present CD -- recorded about 10 years later -- is sad evidence of the decline in Cliburn's career)"
2,Correction to AJAY's review,"I haven't heard this (and am therefore echoing AJAY's 2 star review), but want to correct some misinformation. Jan Akkerman had no involvement with Focus Con Proby. That was done by Thijs Van Leer's new version of Focus after the Akkerman / Van Leer split. Jan's prior works with a vocalist were primarily his recordings with Kaz Lux (""Eli"" is the only one available here). Eli is worthwhile! -- The Fly"
2,Problem!,"Hello!I bought this product, but it didn't help. I cannot open the software and see these pictures.I will make a return as soon as possible."
5,What A WONDERFUL Piano!,"What a wonderful piano! I'm SO HAPPY we bought it! I love playing it, and the sound is wonderful. I'm really glad that Yamaha came up with a piano that everyone can afford. The songbook that comes with the piano is also excellent. I am looking forward to years of happiness for me and my family because of this purchase."
3,Good,The book is written like a text book not an easy read. Condition of the book I bought was great and shipping was very fast.
5,Love this flat iron...,Purchased this flat iron after my hairdresser used it on my hair. Heats up quickly; maintains even heat.Only complaint was that manufacturer would not allow me to register the product because it was not purchased from an authorized dealer (purchased from Amazon). I've had the flat iron for a few years now and continues to work.
1,Unhappy with your product!,"We have been ordering your cherry Stevia for quite some time. We take with us in the restaurants over several months but it has become hardened like rock candy. It's difficult to take apart of the powder in the water, literary it's hard like a rock! Very disappointed."
2,Incorrect package advertising,"This product was advertised as having 15 packets, but what I received was a box with 10 packets. Even the box I received stated there were 10 packets inside."
2,Cherry - YUCK,"these tasted terrible... like really bad cough syrup...the orange is OK, but the cherry is BAD. the drops are much better"
4,Delicious alternative to other so called diet drinks!,"I've become very fond of these stevia sticks. I pop one in about 14 oz of water, in my drinking jar, shake it up, then imbibe. I have a real problem with Crystal Light and most of the other diet drinks upsetting my stomach, which this doesn't at all, I've just ordered additional flavors so I can try them all, Thanks Amazon, for a treat!"
2,Very different taste,"I bought this product as an attempt to reduce the crystal light I drink.This drink mix had a very strange after taste. It didnt blend with the water all that well. In the summer time on a hot day I might drink it, but they really should try to improve the after taste effect and the way it mixes with water."
3,Curved where they shouldn't be curved,"I have purchased Clayton picks in the past and have found them to be pretty sturdy and reliable.I've even bought the Hula Hottie picks before this. Visiting guitarists always get a kick out of them when the reach into my pick jar and find one of the hotties.This batch has more curves than needed.Unlike past picks orders, which I felt were of good quality, these are curved.I'm guessing that the press Clayton is using to print the artwork is forcing a Pringles-chip-like curve into the picks.All but two in the pack were duds.I hope this isn't a sign of things to come for Clayton picks."
3,Fair...,"Not the absolute best recording. The sound seems muffled and ""cloudy"" in areas. Horowitz is absolutley dazzeling with his piano playing although I thought the tempo was alittle fast in the Tchaikovsky."
3,"No ""Breakfast in Bed"" song listed as #15 on back-cover image received; only 20 songs.","The CD I received has same cover design, but only 19 songs-not 20. No song #15 ""Breakfast in Bed"" of supposed 20 as listed on back cover. This song is the only reason I bought the CD. VERY disappointed. // As for the rating, the music is always superb -- but I really wanted this song. I'm a big fan; I have a lot of Pretenders CDs. I really wanted this song. Hmmm... mp3s anyone..."
2,I could not finish this book,"I found the book to be too fragmented, scattered. It was hard to pay attention to. I really did try to keep reading it, I got about 1/3 of the way through it and just gave up. It did have humor but would have been much better if written in a more flowing style instead of choppy, which it was."
5,Beautiful Day - Beautiful Single,"Having thrown away the electronic influences that harboured their last album Pop, U2 has gotten back to basics with 3 men who play instruments and a dyslexic guy in a room. Beautiful Day is easily U2's best song since One, and it's great just to listen to. Very uplifting song. It teaches you that even if your whole life has fallen apart (as it has to the character in the song), you can still find beauty. The other 2 tracks, If you wear that Velvet Dress and Discotheque, taken from U2's live show in Mexico City back in 1997 fit nicely as b-sides on this single. Definitely, this CD is worth a listen...not just a listen, but a listening to every day, it's THAT good. Clearly if this single is any indication of All That You Can't Leave Behind, U2 is once again, headed for Greatness!"
3,"Great story, wanted more","Just finished this book on a long plane ride from Europe. I agree with all the critical assessments above. Not greatly written, did not reveal a lot of insight about the Bruce, etc. But I could not put it down. I was interested in ""Page Crawford's"" story and his outside view of what happened with the Bruce and historical events.I mostly would have preferred to start the story sooner. In my historical readings and such, I already know most of the events from 1306 on. I am still looking for a good novel on what happened before - what created Robert the Bruce and his quest.All and all a good read, not a masterpiece, but if you are interested in Scottish history or more directly, Robert the Bruce, you will enjoy and it is a quick read."
4,I like it!,"My 3 yeat old grand-daughter loves ""Hello Kitty"" but to her ""I like it"" says it all. More puzzle pieces than she's use to, but still can do it."
5,anothewr supherb kogan disc,Kogan never disappoints and this disc is no exception. His playing seems to be technically perfect without loss of musicality. He has to be one of the best all time.
5,a writer,I am one of the writers in BOLD INK and i would just like to say that i had an wonderful time working with my mentor. Writing the pieces that went into the the book as well as the ones that didnt. I would also like to thanks everyone who left a comment. Now I can only speak for myself but i enjoyed hearing good feedback about the book. Please enjoy and thank you very much.
5,"If you like Cliburn and Brahms, buy it!","The Piano Concerto No. 2 in B-flat of Johannes Brahms stands out as one of the summits of writing for piano and orchestra, and Van Cliburn is youthful, masculine, and athletic in his interpretation of this concerto. Brahms poured out his heart into this concerto with a mixture of ""Classical restraint"" and ""Romantic abandon."" Although Cliburn's tempi are a little on the slow side, this fact allows him to be more precise in bringing out the details of one of the longest concerti of all time. The aging Fritz Reiner and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra are effective compliments to this pianistic genius who was then in his late twenties. The five intermezzi that serve as filler are so much more than that in their plaintive beauty, stemming from the meticulous creativity of Brahms in his final years."
3,Love At First Bite video,"The video did not contain the dance scene with the music I Love the Night Life, which is the highlite of the movie. I contacted the seller and they did their best to try and find a copy with this music. Unfortunately they were not able to find it, they did communicate with me thoroughly and I do appreciate their efforts."
4,Love at First Bite,"Hi!We were not happy with the fact that music has been changed at one part of the movie where the two main character are dancing in the Disco. That song title is ""I love the night life"". It makes the movie and we were very disappointed that that was changed for some reason in this copy.Thank you"
3,Unwarrented Re-Edit Do not buy!!!,"This was one of my favorite comedies of the 70's staring George Hamilton and many other favorites. The campy comedy of Dracula in New York is great, seeing how the stereotype vampire lives in the modern day.The biggest complaint is this is not the orginal movie. This is a editted version. Do not buy! The most memorable scene where Dracula dances with Sandy has been edited. ""I love the night life"" has been cut out of the film folks. Write MGM and tell....I did.. I regret buying this movie now and want my money back."
2,Ruined movie on re-release,"This used to be my favorite Vampire spoof movie and just one of my favorite movies. However the new release without the famous disco scene danced to ""I Love The Night Life"" ruins the whole movie. In the original they danced to the music and it set a fast, exciting pace for the romance. The new unknown song has no zip,no excitement,does not sound or feel like an 80's disco tune, and I remember what it was like to dance to those in the discos, and worst of all the dance scene dancing does not match its beat!! Why did they not pop for the rights to the song?? Sorry to George Hamilton who really shines in it, for his sake I gave it 2 stars. I gave this to my trash can so no one else would get stuck with it and I will stick to my old VHS copy of this movie."
3,It's true the song is gone...,I love the Night Life which was perfect for the scene is gone -- after many years --- why -- does anyone know? how weird...
1,I Love the Night Life- but not this DVD,"If you've NEVER seen this movie, you will enjoy it. However, if you remember the theatrical version with the Alicia Bridge's song ""I Love the Night Life"" in the disco scene...well, the lame substitution of a different song has ruined this dvd for me. If I buy a dvd and the contents are SIGNIFICANTLY different than the version I saw in the theater, that information should be available on the package prior to purchase. I'm VERY thankful I got this from Netflix prior to buying it. Ain't gonna happen...unless they re-issue it with ""I Love the Night Life"" restored."
1,Jibbed,"Not The Original Film. Doesn't have the original disco scene with ""I like the night life"" song. I gave it as a gift to a really big fan of this film, she was very disappointed. I feel like an a*s?hole."
1,Worst DVD evr. Its a crime.,"The clasic theme song "" I love the Night Life"" has been replaced by some generic disco music.Its the most famous thing about this moviw for cripes sike. MGM stinks. This DVD is a rip off.It isnt Love at First Bite without ""I love The Night Life"". Movies are really starting to suck."
3,Great Movie = Disappointment with removal of Alicia Bridges,"I, like other reviewers, waited a long time for the DVD release of ""Love at First Bite"" - imagine my disgust to find the dance sequence RUINED with the replacement of Alicia Bridges ""I Love the Night Life"" with some inane, non-disco ballad that was absolutely TERRIBLE and did not fit the sequence at all! If I had known that this song was overdubbed with that awful other poor excuse for music, I would not have bothered purchasing the DVD - I will now watch my video original copy until the tape disintegrates before I play the DVD. If you loved the original - give the DVD version a big miss. Maybe the powers that be will realise the error of their ways and restore Alicia Bridges - until then, hell will freeze over before I watch the DVD!!"
4,Why did they change the song for their dance?,"I have loved this movie since I was a teenager. I decided I had to buy it so I could let my kids watch it with Vampires being so popular now. The movie itself was great I was just disappointed in the disco dancing song - It was scary how I remembered play by play of the movie (owned on VHS some time ago). The song isn't even rememberable now, I can't even tell you the one they replaced it with - the original was perfect!"
2,Coming from UK,This DVD took forever to get but I didn't know it was coming from the UK. The music isn't the same as the original. I don't understand why. I would look elsewhere if I had to do it over again.
2,i want the way it was first made on dvd or Blu-Ray,this release dont have the music it was made with.so this release sucks... punn added :)so if you want a release with the music it was made with then dont buy this release.
3,I Love The Night Life Song Taken Out Of DVD,"Just received the movie Love At First Bite DVD from White Crow Media. Itarrived on time, but I was disappointed that the song ""I Love The NightLife"" was taken out of the scene where they danced in the disco. Thissong was the highlight of the movie, I hope that the song will be putback so other viewers can appreciate the right version of the scene."
2,Old VHS,"Although the movie was exactly what I was looking for, the quality of this copy was very grainy. It was viewable, but not very clear."
2,Terribly disappointed,"Went out of my way to purchase the lower-quality VHS tape, with all its fuzziness and lines throughout the picture, not to mention poor audio, knowing full well that it would be inferior to the (presumably) better quality DVD, on the strength of a stupid assumption that it would be the original version with the original disco hit, rather than the lame substitute that was spliced in, and which others have already complained about. Alas, I should have known better, and have only myself to blame. It's still a terrific movie, a real hoot, and the only thing that dampens enjoyment is that one horrible infraction, which evidently, can't be remedied. Word to the wise: if you're going to suffer through an inferior version of this movie, at least get it in the best fidelity you can and pass on the tape."
1,Music Replaced On DVD,early copies of the dvd are available and as was feared the song I Love The Night Life has been removed.
1,Missing Nite Life Sucks,"I wish I had read further in the reviews, if I had known that the song 'I Love The Nite Life' had been replaced I would never have bought the film. It is very limp without this...shame, shame, shame! This should be mentioned so that folks can make a more informed decision, instead of wasting money."
3,They left out a song,"It's a corny film but has lots of funny lines. The best is when Susan St James asks Dracula if he wants a quickie? He says, ""No. With you it's never a quickie. Always a longie.""I was disappointed that they didn't use the Alicia Bridges I Love the Night Life music in the dance scene. Night Life was in the original movie and it's even in the credits, but they dubbed in some other disco piece for the DVD."
4,IF YOU LIKE GEORGE HAMILTON YOU'LL LOVE THIS,IF YOU LIKED ZORRO THE GAY BLADE YOU'LL LOVE THIS. ARTIE JOHNSON WAS A GREAR REINFIELD. SUSAN ST. JAMES WAS OK BUT THIS IS ONE OF HAMILTONS BEST.
3,Buyer Beware - they took out the original I Love the Night Life song,"The whole movie was ruined for me when I discovered to my horror that the DVD release of the movie has substituted the signature Alicia Bridges song ""I Love the Night Life"" with some other definitely non-disco song. It ruined the whole movie. As some other reviewers mentioned pretty much everywhere, this a TRAVESTY. The whole tone of the movie is lost. So BEWARE if you're looking to get back the look and feel you felt when you first saw the movie, it's all gone. It's still a good funny movie, Richard Benjamin is great and George Hamilton can't go over the top enough in his portrayal of Count Dracula. Just be forewarned, your favorite song which made the whole movie was removed."
3,A great movie ... could have been a better DVD,"I saw this movie as a kid and it's still as funny today if not for different reasons. Unfortunately the DVD could have had a few extras in it other than just the trailer. Also the substitution for Alicia Bridges song ""I Love the Night Life"" during the disco scene (presumably due to copyright) is glaringly noticable and does detract from the movie if you've seen the original because it fit so well into that scene. Still a great movie for both young and old."
1,Save Your Money - Don't Buy It,"This has been a favorite of mine for over twenty years and I was very excited that it was out on dvd. I just got my copy of the dvd today and I am very disappointed that MGM did such a lousy re-transfer job and most importantly during the disco scene they removed Alicia Bridge's song ""I Love The Nightlife"" and dubbed another song over it. How cheap can they get. This movie made that song popular. Save your money, buy something else. When this movie is on cable or broadcast tv - record it."
4,Forget the Mel Brooks/Leslie Neilsen flick,"This is one rip-roaringly funny movie. An earlier reviewer, also from GA, omitted my favorite line in a film that has so many: ""...It was your GRANDMOTHER!""See the film and you'll get it!"
1,Love At First Bite...NOT BITING!,"Simply put...SKIP THIS DVD! Like others have said, without the ORIGINAL theatrical release version of ""I Love The Nightlife"" playing in the backround of the dance/seduction scene, this DVD ain't worth the plastic coaster it's burned on! If anything's getting burned by this inferior version, it's the consumer! Vote with your wallet. Tell MGM to spend the few extra bucks that it would have taken to include the original disco song by Alicia Bridges by NOT PURCHASING this DVD! If enough people feel this way, it will hopefully get back to MGM and then you'll see... eventually they will release another version with digitally enhanced video and audio, maybe on Blu-ray, but most importantly, hopefully WITH the ORIGINAL authentic soundtrack intact! Of course we'll then have to pay something like $25.99 for the release... but, it'll be well worth it!"
5,Affordable dvd enjoyment,"I bought this dvd used, and the condition it was described as was very good. It was sent to me very quickly, and the dvd was better than very good. I would say, like new. There was not a blemish on it, and it played perfectly. I could have paid twice as much for having a brand new one, but the rating of this seller was very positive, so I decided it was worth a try. For those who like movies, and spend their bucks on their favorite classics, or new ones, this is a way to have affordable dvd enjoyment."
2,4 1/2 Stars For The Movie but 2 Stars for The DVD!,"I fondly recall going to see Love at First when I was a teen and I thought it was good and I remember the dance scene with Alicia Bridges' song I Love The Night Life and I'm not a disco geek or a techo freak but I'm disappointed that the song was eliminated and replaced with a different song, however I don't think it's fair to blame the movie studio and director over that as it appears that they didn't have a choice because Alicia wouldn't allow them to use the song anymore so hopefully someday she will finally agree to let them use it and a new DVD can be issued! Maybe people can write to Alicia Bridges' and the record company she recorded the song for and ask them to please let the song be used in the movie again!"
2,"""I Love The Nightlife"" disco music missing",I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this movie. Some idiot decided it would be a good idea to replace the original music from the dance scene. I have noticed that there are quite a number of other customers who also didn't appreciate this stupid change in the movie.
3,5-Star Movie Decreased By No DVD Extras And Missing Disco Song,"The movie is just as fresh and funny as it was a quarter century ago, with perfect casting, dialogue, action and timing. Of special note is Richard Benjamin's utterly hysterical portrayal of the obsessed, manic shrink dangling long-time girlfriend Susan St. James and on the hunt for his Grandfather Van Helsing's eternal nemesis, Dracula (he changed his name ""for professional reasons""). The DVD loses significant points for the unforgiveable change in disco songs during a critical scene, and for virtually no extras. Shame on whoever was responsible for the song fiasco, and for the carelessness in buffing up a classic 70s comedy!"
2,Funny Movie-Sad DVD,"A lot of people are going to be disappointed to learn that Alicia Bridges song ""I love the nightlife"" has been replaced with some crappy Donna Summer-esque song. The DVD picture and sound are fine, but for true fans of this movie: Beware! Try to catch it on cable where they show the original version."
2,I expected better!,"Not only did they ruin they DVD version by replacing the theme song of it's theatrical release, the didn't include any extras. When this was shown on network television for the first time there was a deleted scene that took place on the subway during Dracula's ""black chicken"" night on the town. I am very disappointed in the DVD. In an age where most DVDs have extras, this is pathetic. Whoever oversaw this project for MGM/UA should be fired!"
4,JUST AS ADVERTISED,"THANKS FOR THE PROMPT SERVICE AND ITEM AS ADVERTISED. I GOT IT FOR THE DANCE SEQUENCE MUSIC AND TURNS OUT THAT HAD TO BE REPLACED BECAUSE OF ROYALTY FEES! IT'S ON YOU TUBE, THOUGH, FOR YOUR INFORMATION, SINCE THE ORIGINAL IS SO MUCH BETTER. IT'S A FUN MOVIE."
3,"Great for studio work, not so much for hiking","I picked this tripod up to handle my Mamiya RB67 which is a beast of a camera. It handled the RB67 magnificently and I found it stable enough to handle a monorail 4x5 that was well above its suggested weight capacity. If your only requirements are cheap and sturdy then this is an excellent buy. If you're looking for something that portable, compact, or quick to set up then you're better off biting the bullet and splashing out a few hundred more for something made out of carbon fiber with a ballhead.Its a great tripod for people who have a studio where they can set their equipment up and store it. Its inexpensive, durable, it will last forever, and it can handle a great deal of weight. I've tried taking it hiking but found that its not only heavy but quite bulky and it doesn't fit comfortably in my pack."
2,"Looks good, but...","Slow leg unlocking system. Cumbersome and heavy. Like the other reviewer, I'm looking for another tripod to replace this one."
2,Not worth the hassle; not worth the $,"Initially this unit seemed to work pretty well. I wasn't thrilled aboutthe copyright protection issues or the extremely slow time to load, but I decided to try to work with it. In six months, this player often arbitrarily decides not to record sometimes, and it often stops recording regular TV programming (my wife's favorite soap) due to ""copyright issues"" - completely ridiculous!Now this unit will not output any audio signals at all. Stay away from this piece of garbage. I used to respect Sony quality - I will never buy from them again!"
2,Expect more from Sony,"When you buy a name like Sony, you expect to get decent stuff. This DVD Recorder failed miserably. No S-Video inputs in the rear so you have to run S-Video to the front panel (which my 2 year old loved to unplug). Nice editing features if you have the time. Unit malfunctioned within a year and is currently in getting warranty work done (who knows if I will get it back). I replaced it with a Lite-On DVD recorder (at less than half the price) and am very happy with it."
1,Only A Simpleton Would Spend the Extra Hundred,"I bought this player and had it for the afternoon before returning it. I got a great deal on a player missing only the remote thinking I would just order a new one from Sony. Well, it turned out that the remote is almost $60-which seems a little crazy. Then various online reviews were mostly terrible and I figured I better try something else. I usually do a little research but it was a great deal and I never thought Sony would put out something this bad.As for Eduardo from Houston-who is reviewing things he hasn't even bought-don't call someone a simpleton for not wanting to spend $100 to be able to record HBO when they can just buy a different DVD recorder for a similar price that can record HBO. In my opinion the guy that goes out and spends that extra hundred on his $200 DVD recorder is truly the simpleton."
3,COPY PROTECTION workaround,"Those of you grousing about problems with recording copy-protected content need to pull your heads out of your backsides and do a little research before foaming at the mouth. There are these things called ""image stabilizers"" one of the most widely used is made by Sima and goes for about a hundred bucks. Do a Google search and you'll find out.I'm giving this 3 stars only because it's a neutral rating, I have not ordered this model yet but simply wanted to correct the simpletons' complaint."
3,"OK, but it doesn't work now","This DVR was OK for what we used it for, but now (for the last year almost) it only intermittently records DVDs. it seems to be a heat related problem, and I've done the best I can to separate it from other equipment. It often works in the AM on one or two programs and then quits. This is the second SONY DVR i've had that is heat sensitive to recording and the 3rd overall that just seems to quit after a year or so of service. It's out of warranty and I'm not sure what to buy anymore."
1,making copies,"Originally purchased another Sony DVD recorder. Nothing worked.Bought the RDRGX315. It made acceptable DVDs of twenty-year old VHS tapes. Now, when I go to make copies of those DVDs for the family, MY COPIES are copy-protected. They can't be stored on my hard-drives. I can't even make a copy when they are played on another DVD player, back to the GX 315. The DVDs do not have standard VIDEO_TS files, and neither Windows-XP, nor OS-X can find valid files to make copies. Eventually, I had to buy a European copy-cracking utility ( I know it's illegal) to enable me to make copies of my own disks. I should have known I had a problem when the DVD I made for the family of the dead Marine said they could not play it."
3,useful sony interface - limited performance,"i've purchased many, many sony products. i've owned a dvd-burner already (lite-on) and used one belonging to a friend (go-video). this one is easily the most user-friendly and produces the nicest menus.however, i've found limited editing ability. specifically, if i try to record a disc with multiple, short edits, the disk starts skipping/freezing after about 8 chapters (each chapter having several edits). also, sometimes the discs burned on this player fails to play correctly on other dvd-players - even other sony dvd-players.my experience with stand-alone dvd-burners is that they are great for plain old copying-off-the-air and for transferring old vhs-tapes to dvd. but for complex, home-video editing, using a computer with a dvd-burner and the appropriate software seems the best way to go."
2,Would not record DVD-R and DVR+R,"I have always had good luck with Sony products in the past including my last DVD player, so I waited for the GX315 to come out instead of buying the GX300. Unfortunately despite using many DVD's, from different brands including Sony's own, I could never get the recorder to record on DVD-R or DVD+R, only DVD-RW. This little problem coupled with the 30+ second start up time while the disk ""loads"" and the slow response of the on-screen menu, I decided to return it. The return process at Amazon was remarkably easy and the support staff at Amazon was great. I only wish I could say as much for the DVD recorder."
2,Problems copying VHS tapes to DVD,"I'm not crazy about this unit. I bought it to replace a Philips player, which I loved until it died at the age of 5 months. As others have mentioned, the Sony feels sluggish when loading discs and responding to the remote. It also makes a lot more noise than the Philips player. Connecting a VCR to the composite video inputs on the DVD recorder for copying VHS tapes to DVD is unreliable. For some tapes it works fine. For others the resulting picture on the DVD jumps 1 to 2 times per second. Totally useless. This is not a copy-protect problem - these are homemade tapes. The problem does not occur if the VCR is connected to the DVD recorder with an RF connection instead of the composite video connection. I spent about 45 minutes on the phone with a Sony tech support person who was basically clueless and who provided no help at all."
1,Switching,"The Sony RDRGX315 DVD Recorder needs to be hooked up to a cable/sat box to operate. I have cable but no box. Without the box, you cannot view the DVDs nor can you switch from TV to DVD. Very bad design flaw. If you purchase one, look at page 12 for install notes. I returned it."
4,Works Fine.....Good Unit,I've owned this unit now for 6 months and never had a problem yet. I can't understand all the negative reviews here. If you read the entire owner's manual and take time to use it you should have no problems.
1,"As great as this product seems, do NOT buy!","I bought this DVD recorder because it was one of the few that recorded onto virtually every format. Plus, it's a Sony, and I've never had any problems with Sony before. The recorder works intermittently. It recorded a few hours worth of shows, then it would corrupt the disk, rendering it useles (abaout 2/3 of the time). I thought maybe it was the media, so I bought Sony media (this time it only corrupted the disk 1/3 of the time). I sent the product to Sony for repair and ""they could not duplicate the issue"" so they sent it back. The Sony repair service center is located in South Texas, where the labor is cheap and it shows. I got my unit back, and on the 2nd disk, it failed!! Now the door is jammed and I can't take the DVD out. Don't buy this product. I'm buying Samsung from now on."
5,A Rainforest Resource Guide for Teachers,"Castner has more than 15 years experience in the neotropics and experience working with children. His book will provide teachers valuable information and a guide to teaching students about the importance of rainforest, its biodiversity and culture. The guide also will help teachers outline lesson plans that are pertinent and at the appropriate level for students to learn. This book is highly recommended to teachers of K-12 who teach or will be teaching a rainforest unit to their students."
1,My phat ass this is the hottest freestyle artists,"This CD might be nice to have for the Irene, Feliz, and Paula, and all the other artists can go somewhere else. This is the gyest CD I've bought. Where are these people from? Canada. That couls be part of the problem. These singers you could tell are wacked out, and make freestyle look bad. They contributed to the downfall of freestyle late 90's. The male singers are like geek frestyle, they relate to like to some of those dudes on Ti Amo's vol.4 people. They have no energy, and sound staight up lame!"
1,Crappy CD,This cd isnt all that good. The artists cant sing well and some of them were probably told they will make money off the cd just to put them on.Anything made from Daniel Bijan or anyone close to him shouldnt be doing freestyle cause they suck at producing.
3,"Fun, once you finally build it...","This rocket car took my very mechanically-inclined husband 3 hours to build. It required very precise measuring and cutting of foil tape, foam, and nearly all the parts. He even needed to use pliers to bend the axles properly. The instructions were extremely complex; there is no way a child could understand them, let alone actually build the car. An eight year old (the toy is recommended for 8 and up) can play with this car, but certainly not build it. It was a lot of fun to shoot off on our street, and ours went straight ahead. But it was an agonizing 3 hours to get there."
1,don't try this at home,"received this as a gift for my 9 year olds birthday. decided over the summer break to build.....wow! no way this is for a kid to build alone, i still can't get the wheels on - the instructions are terrible. based on this experience i would never buy a toy from this company again."
1,Parts don't fit...,"When trying to assemble this kit, the holes in the wheels (all three wheels) were not large enough to allow the axle to fit through, thus preventing us from even completing the project. The instructions were also not that clear. There is more to making this kit work than just putting parts together, so if you are looking for something quick and easy, pass on this one."
1,I'd like to give it no stars at all,"Ladies and gentlemen of this global jury: What we have before us here is the closest to travesty that modern society can boast. Oxymoron? Certainly, though a pale one compared to this rubbish. Why, in an age of supposed growing enlightenment, do we need to find the worst in everything we see? Why is it not possible, in the interests of Diana's sons as much of anything, to accept, sad as it is, that this was a tragedy? It was. The travesty is that purient speculation sells books, newspapers and, here at least, a heavily criticised and slated TV documentary.Ladies and gentlemen; I put it to you that this book is rubbish."
4,PRINCESS DIANA WAS MURDERED.,Finally two respectful journalists could summon up the courage to say that Princess Diana was the victim of a hedious conspiracy. All the evidence is there in this book. Undeniably the best book on the subject so far.
3,Not Conclusive,"Interesting facts about the papparazzi and the holiday leading up to the accident which killed Diana. The chapter reporting the engineer's finding is not only technical, but gives supporting proof of a collision with a Fiat prior to the deadly collision with the 13th pillar of the Alma Tunnel. This book gives a handful of theories to think about, but the only thing not convincing to me is the conspiracy theory that the Princess was going to wed Dodi. The ending is not conclusive."
3,Authors vindicate Mohammed Al-Fayed,One has to be a buffoon to believe Diana was not murdered. The failure to establish a thorough going British inquiry clearly points to a government cover-up.Sir Randulph Fiennes was an officer in the Royal Scots Grey and attached to the elite SAS. He wrote a book (non-fiction) about a secret group of assassins and how they murdered people while making it look like an accident. Cars were tampered with and the steering/braking system was operated by remote control which could override the normal system via compressed air from a tiny scuba diving cylinder hidden in the engine compartment. It is possible that Diana's Mercedes was externally controlled in this way.
2,Outdated look at Princess Diana's death,"This book contains many factual mistakes, but since it was written over 2 years ago, before many facts were uncovered by the French investigation, I am not really penalizing it much for that.About half of the book consists of background information on Dodi and Diana. This part could have been much shorter. I don't need to know, nor do I care about, Dodi's favorite pets as a child.The actual part related to the investigation was an evenhanded treatment of the facts as they were known in 1998. To the authors' credit, they investigate the most wild theories in a fair manner. When information was not known or available, they plainly state so. Unfortunately, they hint darkly a few times in the book that a source (which they can't name) tells them there is 'something big' not known about the case. This shot down the authors' credibility."
4,What a variety!,"Unlike most Cd's this one focuses on variety and classics rather than one specific composer or emotion. It includes a Requiem Mass, ment for a funeral, and Canon in D, one of the most celebrated joyous pieces in history. 2 opposite worlds, on one great cd!"
2,?????,This is my first antenna so im having problems setting it up can anyone help me? I have everything set up its just putting the top of the antenna on is tricky to me!
5,Well made and very effective,"Got this for a cross country caravan trip to Yellowstone. It's very well made and gives excellent performance. Car to car range varied from 1/2 mile in heavy traffic over rolling terrain, to more than 2 miles on the wide open prairie. In 7000 miles of driving, in sun, rain, and high wind, the magnet never once came loose. Easy to tune with an SWR meter by loosening a set screw (wrench included) and adjusting the height of the top piece. I highly recommend this tuning for best performance.When you get home the antenna knocks down to a convenient size for easy storage. It even comes with it's own vinyl storage pouch."
2,Worked fine for 6 months then stopped.,"I used this antenna on a bi-weekly basis for about 6 months until it stopped working.Pros:-Cheap! ($16 you can beat that!)-It didn't require tuning and worked A okay right out of the box-Nearly perfect length cord-Strong magnetic baseCons:-Stop working after about 6 months due to the cable-The top part of the antenna bend after a little useIf you are looking for a cheap CB attena to use here an there this would be fine for you, but if your looking for something that will last a while and with good build quality this isn't for you."
2,For Car-To-Car Only,"It's inexpensive, sturdy and reliable. It will get you out there for the closer car-to-car communication only, but it is not a ""performer"". If you want something that will give you any kind of distance, this is not the antenna."
2,First Rate Illustrations But Tedious Story,"Probably appropriate for 5-8 yrs. This story is very slow going for 4 year olds, and younger. They'll grow quickly bored, even though the illustrations are very good.The story centers around two young girls, Sarah and Susan who go to visit their Great-great-aunt Flossie. Aunt Flossie has a large collection of hats and has a mildly amusing, but forgetable story that goes with each hat. She retells a couple of stories to the girls, and they all go out for crab cakes.There are so many other childrens books that your children will enjoy more, that make this one worth skipping."
2,So much for progress...,"The world's premier rock band has unfortunately resorted to re-treading badly dated European pop songs from the mid-80's. Or I guess it could be just a coincidence that the chorus from Beautiful Day sounds remarkably similar to A-Ha's The Sun Always Shines On TV. I'm surprised there aren't any Duran Duran samples, or better yet, how about a Flock of Seagulls cover! Personally, I was hoping for something fresh, modern, and really hard-hitting. Instead I get Bono lost in some melodramatic fog of new wave nostalgia. It's essentially The Sweetest Thing with a heavier arrangement. U2 have always had major potential, but at this point in their career it seems unlikely that they will ever really break free from their depressing post-punk roots."
3,Thorough and interesting,"If you would like to learn the relationship of Lotus Sutra buddhism in Japan to buddhism in general, you will find this book clearly written and informative. It also gives a good summary of the various branches of Japanese buddhism that are sprang from Nichiren's promotion of the Lotus Sutra, including what the Japanese call ""New Religions,"" like Soka Gakkai and Rissho Kosei Kai. The author is evidently a believer, or is very sympathetic to Nichiren's understanding of buddhism, so the book doesn't criticize. I would have liked for some explanation of why Nichiren-inspired sects are so, well, sectarian. They don't seem to get along very well. Nevertheless, a very interesting read from which I learned much."
2,"Slow, boring, stupid story, bad acting","I think the title of this review pretty much says it all. This is just a very old movie that is poorly photographed, poorly directed, poorly acted. Marlene just looks fat in it. The story is more suited to a silent film and it moves so slowly that I think they were leaving time for you to read the diaglogue across the bottom of the screen. Don't waste your time or money on this one. Blonde Venus is a much better movie and Golden Earrings makes all of them look like crap."
4,Romance and Adventure in North Africa,"MOROCCO is a very early Marlene Dietrich film directed by Josef von Sternberg. Dietrich, Gary Cooper and Adolph Menjou give excellent performances. The scene in a nightclub where Dietrich passes her apartment key to French Legionnaire Cooper is priceless. MOROCCO is probably a very good movie for 1930 and it gives a strong hint of the greatness Dietrich and Josef von Sternberg will achieve in later movies. However, it is clearly not quite as good as SHANGHAI EXPRESS and some of their other collaborations.MOROCCO received Oscar nominations but no awards for Best Director, Actress (Marlene Dietrich), Cinematography and Art Direction."
1,GREAT MOVIE BUT HORRIBLE AUDIO,"I was lucky enough to have been able to get a copy of Morocco on VHS. I was very excited before inserting the tape in my VCR, but soon became quite disappointed with the audio quality. You could barely understand the actors when they spoke. The sound is really bad. The copy that I purchased was new, and not one of those inexpensive imitations from unpopular realeasing studios. This was the original Paramount version. The movie was very good for 1930, obviously not as good as other Dietrich movies. I still HIGHLY recomended if you are a Marlene Dietrich fan, even with the bad sound."
1,CHEAP,"Cheaply made. The lampshade had seams everywhere. All I can say is, it's garbage and save your money."
1,NFL faceplate for Xbox 360,This product looks cool but renders your Xbox useless. Once installed the power on/reset button no longer functions. Save your money.
5,Great bag!,"This bag is really very pretty as well as practical. The ergonomics are great - handle and wheels very smooth. Inside the bag is roomy with plenty of organizational features to keep your ""stuff"" while traveling. The best part is being able to find it instantly in the baggage area."
3,Gossipy but Intriguing,"This isn't a lurid tell-all about Jessica Savitch, and it isn't a comprehensive and insightful biography; it's somewhere in between. Then again, considering the life Savitch led, any comprehensive biography would be rather lurid. Nash manages to get incredibly candid interviews with the most important people in Savitch's life, and develops some interesting and believable theories about the newswoman's self-destructiveness. Her portrayal of the state of television news in the 70s is perhaps the most fascinating thing about the book; expanding and deepening that portryal would, I think, make the book all the stronger. However, in the end, Nash does use too many broad strokes there, and seems unwilling to examine the true extent of Savitch's drug use, love life, or professional knowledge. It's interesting reading, but in the end, it's a two-dimensional portrait, all surface and flash. Not unlike Savitch herself."
4,"Excellent solid leg, ok metal head without any bubble level.",I just wanted to let you know that the head does not have a bubble level that is ubiquitous nowadays. I recommend it if you need a good solid portable leg and want to use a separate bubble level or change the head anyway.I strongly recommend Slik AF2100 pistol grip head for this tripod leg. As a travel tripod I couldn't find a better combination at any price range.
4,"Heavy, but worth it.","I have had this tripod for over 2 years now. It has performed beautifully. It feels very sturdy - I am comfortable with my 7d sitting on it fully extended. The only downside is the size and weight - it does not collapse to a very tidy size (making it fun when you are at the airport) - but I figure if you want something to last it needs to have a little size to it (unless you are willing to drop a little more $$$ on it) ... plus you need some weight if you are going to hold a 7d with some heavy lenses.I am not a professional (at all), but this serves me well on trips and when at family gatherings. When traveling, it fits reasonably on the outside of my carry-on (which is a Gregory day-pack) when looped through the gear loops - it is probably a little longer than collapsible trekking poles."
5,happy tunes,"These are some catchy songs, with lots of cute, fun little lyrics. My favorite moment is when she says I wanna be a puppy dog. One of my favorite cds right now. They rock live too, and are really nice."
5,Great Overlooked Album,"If you enjoyed new band Lusk's ""Free Mars"", you'll love this CD - you can tell they were listening to it. Great progressive rock with a heavy bass and soaring harmonies. Also, some great fun to be had as the band rips off Johnny Cash and Elvis in a couple of novelty tunes that serve as a nice break from all the serious stuff. Great playing and singing throughout, and the whole album has its own feel to it that's never been duplicated."
5,Awesome Album,Superb work by Lynne and Wood...especially love the bonus tracks! This is a must for Jeff Lynne/Roy Wood and ELO fans.
4,I really do like this album but...,"Why do they keep shuffling the running order of the songs on every issue in the US & The UK?At least it's got it's title and original artwork back. The original US release the artwork has a Jukebox rising out of a terraced hill with 2 Iguanas roaming around. An edited US edition of this set of songs was released 1972 - 1973 (on United Artists) as ""Split Ends"" with different artwork.I now stand corrected. I've checked the song list with the Wikipedia song list and have found the first 10 songs are in their original order[...]"
2,Awful Remastering!!!,It is unfortunate that such amazing music gets such heavy handed remastering. Peter Mew (Abbey Road mastering engineer) has once again smothered another remaster with noise reduction until it chirps like an MP3. The sound is boomy and closed off.I'm grateful to have The Move on CD once again but I wish a more competent remastering engineer was employed. When's Peter Mew going to retire?

5,UN REGALO PARA ALGUIEN ESPECIAL,"Este es un autèntico regalo para cualquier criatura...mejor que un trenecito o un robot que lo divierte sin enseñarle nada, sin dejarlo participar activamente !Y los dibujos para colorear son magnìficos !"
5,¡que hermoso cuento iinteractivo !,"¡LO MEJOR PARA QUE NUESTROS NIÑOS SE INVOLUCREN EN LA HISTORIA, QUE TOMEN PARTE Y NO SE QUEDEN AL MARGEN !Este es un autèntico regalo para cualquier criatura...mejor que un trenecito o un robot que lo divierte sin enseñarle nada, sin dejarlo participar activamente !Y los dibujos para colorear son magnìficos !"
4,Very nice if you are not tall,"I got it at $70 from Amazon and used it for half a year for my EOS 40D +28-135 lens. It is light and stable. It is always with me, even in hiking! But I think it is designed for Japanese, who are normally not tall~"
5,I love this tripod,"This tripod is great. My last one fell apart quicky but this one is very well built without being heavy! I am a 4'10"" girl and a weenie to boot but I lug it everywhere! It has taken tons of abuse and is as good as new, I have had it a while and expect to have for a very long time. I didn't really want to spen this much but it will probibly save me the frustration of many cheap ones so in the end a great deal! I lent it to a taller friend who also loved it and has asked for it for Christmas."
1,Ugh!,"I am a huge Battletech fan, but his is the first Battletech novel that i could not finish. I really do not understand how some reviewers can recommend this to any Battletech fan, because about half way in i got to a point where i felt like it would ruin the whole franchise for me if i read even 1 more page.To each his own i guess.Just like the reviewer before me, i will avoid reading any more Camacho's Caballeros novels."
1,stay away,The main character is superwoman in the world of battletech. This character is not feasable at all. If I were new to the world of battletech novels this novel would keep from readinganother.
1,By far the worst of Classic Battletech,"I'm up to Bred for War and this novel is by far the worst I've found (and that's saying a lot after Far Country). The characters are completely unbelievable (beginning with Cassie, as other commenters have said). The plot is full of holes and doesn't even know where it wants to go. And being Spanish, I found both the latin characterization and the language spoken completely ridiculous.I'll certainly refrain from reading any other Camacho's novels while I keep reading the series, and I recommend you do the same."
5,"If you never read BattleTech before, read this book.",This book follows the great traditions started by Keith and Stackpole. The characters are well developed and the action is good. This is a great stand alone book and its two sequels are also good. I recommend this book to all who love great SciFi action novels.
5,ADDICTING!!!!!!!,"This series is so addicting - I read the first 7 books in 2 days, starting on book 8 now. I literally can't put the books down!!! The story line is very gripping and unique. One of the best book series I've read by far! A must read :)"
5,the truth,"Morgan is going to New york City to with Hunter, Bree, Robbie, Raven and Sky. Morgan's been having dreams about amyranth and Hunter is going to investigate. Morgan is not scared all her thoughts are around Hunter. But her wanna be romantic get away turns to a life or death decision. What will happen to morgan? Read this book and find out."
5,The thrilling seventh book in the Sweep series.,"Morgan has discovered her true heritage, but she has paid an enormous price. In just a few short months, her life has changed forever. Cal, her first love, the one she thought was her soulmate, betrayed her, and then died to save her. She has come to love Hunter, Cal's half-brother, and believes he may be her soulmate. She is learning more about magick, her powers, and her birth parents, and on a trip to New York City with Hunter and some of her friends, she hopes to learn even more. But Morgan is not prepared for the truths she discovers, and everything she has ever believed about her birth parents is challenged. Is Morgan strong enough to face the truth, even if it will break her heart? The ending to this book completely shocked me and left me eager to read the next book. This book is an essential read for any fan of the Sweep series."
3,one craa-azy movie!,"Oy, this is one oddball of a movie! I saw about half of it many, many years ago and remembered some of the scenes. Seeing it again now, it's not as funny as I remembered but still worth checking out. If you like crazy comedies that don't take themselves seriously (e.g. ""Airplane""), chances are you will enjoy this one!"
1,Not worth the cost,Was very disappointed in the amount of sheets you receive for the price.Highly over rated in my book.
1,impossible to rate if the product is out of order,"Though we had expected to be able to send this item to you, we'vesince found that it is not available from any of our sources at thistime. We realize this is disappointing news to hear, and we apologizefor the inconvenience we have caused you.We must also apologize for the length of time it has taken us to reachthis conclusion. Until recently, we had still hoped to obtain thisitem for you.We have cancelled this item from your order."
1,Beyond bad,"I figured I should balance out the one glowing review I read since I think this is just awful. Almost bad enough to show it at my annual ""Turkey Movie"", but not quite. Where to start...it's a video (not film)...atrociously acted...more predictable than you can believe...and so, so very long at 92 minutes or so. If you must see it to belive how bad it is, rent it."
1,Pitiful,"I saw this at a friends house--so thank God I didn't pay any money to see this bit of idiocy. I can only assume any good review you read was written by someone with a financial stake in the film! The guys are not hot...not even lukewarm for that matter. The acting is terrible. Please...anyone who had anything to do with this, don't continue in the film industry. If it was possible to assign negative stars, I would do so for this awful experience. Run away!"
5,I was at the gunfight at carnegie hall--a historic night!,"I don't know why people think the concert at Carnegie Hall was a failure of some sort. It wasn't. I was present at the late show which began at midnight. After the earlier show, Phil broke through one of the windows at the entrance when they woulnd't let him back in. I think he had stitches and he was pretty drunk but he played the second show anyway. And what a show it was! I can only tell you that after some resistance the crowd did get what he was doing and the show went on for hours. In fact everyone was dancing by the end, including the ushers. Even after management attempted to turn off the power the concert continued! (Phil said ""Turn the power on-pass it back!"" and within minutes the entire place was demanding more power and they did turn it back on.) I have been to a couple of hundred concerts over the years and this one ranks as one of the best, if not the best! It was an utterly legendary night! I miss Phil Ochs."
4,Fine for me...,"I've had mine since it first came out and I've had absolutely no problems with it at all, and I also have a friend who's had his almost a year and he's satisfied, too. The programs it comes with are easy to use as well. I think the only downside to getting a Dell DJ over an iPod is the fact that there aren't nearly as many accessories--it's kind of sad to see all the things you can get for an iPod when almost none of them fit with a DJ and Dell doesn't really have that many things for you to buy."
5,Great,"I had a Dell DJ for almost 4 years and loved it. It got stolen 3 weeks ago out of my car so I am going the Ipod route now. Things I loved about the DJ... Intuitive interface, Solid as a brick (I dropped mine many times, and punished the hell out of it. Eventually I just accepted the fact that it wasn't going to break and just did whatever I wanted with it. ex. throw it in my bag.) Battery is pretty good, Sound is as good as an ipod. Doesn't have all the bells and whistles an ipod does but it is a heck of a good machine in my opinion."
1,Junk,"Like other Dell products this one is a dud. After less than two years, it has begun to skip and emit static. Naturally, the warranty has expired, and there is no recourse. Expensive electronic items should not die as quickly as Dell products tend to do. Do NOT buy from Dell. Disappointment is the only guarantee."
3,Not bad for the price,"I've had my DJ 20 for a year now, and overall, Im happy with it, although its my first mp3 player. The only quirk so far, it has froze up 2 times, but easily remedied with the reset ""hole"" on the bottom. I have no idea if other brand mp3 players freeze up like that, but its a bit disappointing. The battery lasts a long time for me, so no complaints there. The program to upload music is ""musicmatch"" which after a while of figuring out how to use it, works mostly OK, but it also has froze up on occasion, which is very annoying. So my overall ratings are- -DJ ""good"" software--""OK""."
1,Don't Buy Dell DJ's,"Like ther other cases my DJ 20 lasted only one year ans to quote Dell rep. ""Your DJ has died and cannot be repaired"" you can buy a replacement for $150.00. Sad thing is that it was the SECOND Dj that they had sent me that died and it froze up like the other ones you have read about. These units have a manufactures defect..don't buy them, like other Dell products ...junk."
4,It's good beautiful and intresting product,I like this product very much but wanna make shure that is re-chargable like Dell DJ Ditty.
1,go buy a ipod why dont you?,Why buy a Dell DJ when you can buy a ipod. An ipod is a sleek cool device and its popular. Do u see people or kids walking aroung with a dell dj? NO! you mostly find someone having a ipod. PLus! ipod has itunes to go with it. If you ask me i think dell should stink with its comp and printers. NOT MADE FOR MP3 PLAYERS!
2,Not much help for a serious collector or dealer,"The scope of the book is too broad and the depth of the topics considered is too shallow. Complex collectibles such as costume jewelry or art glass are given a few pages of attention, but the book tries to cover too many areas at the expense of giving adequate attention to any area. If you want a very, very basic overview, history, and details about popular collectibles, you may find this book of some use. However, your money would probably be more wisely spent on books that deal with your specific topics of interest. It's fun reading, but definitely not a ""complete guide to collecting...""."
4,Entertaining overall view of collectibles,"If you are just getting into collecting, this is a fun book to review. Lots of overall ideas of varieties of collectibles...for more serious colletors, I would suggest books oriented to the subject matter of interest."
1,"Don't join the "" Gateway Nightmare Club""","I don't own this specific model, however I did purchase the Gateway DS 450XL. My laptop worked well for a year and then the nightmare began. The harddrive and screen went bad. I didn't worry because I had purchased the 3 year warranty. After exhanging numerous calls and shipping my laptop back to Gateway. The lapto was returned. It worked well for 2 weeks. I called Gateway again we spent 45 min. attempting the fix the problem. This was unsuccessful. They wanted me to pay another $40 to send the computer back to them . THe service is unsatisfactory and the computer had never worked properly since the first year. Owning a Gateway Product is a nightmare and trying to keep their produts running well is a full time job. I will NEVER purchase another Gateway product. I wouldn't even accept one as a gift."
1,"Crap,","I mabey only 12, but it wasn't just my computer, it was my families, just so ya know.I had a very similar model. And it was a piece of crap. All computers(well almost all) get virus's, even with protection software. I had 11 virus's after the first week. The video/graphics preformance on gateway laptops suck. If you really want one of these, then get the equivilent of this laptop, A GAMEBOY! If you want good preformance, especialy graphics and video, get a MAC. MACS have alot of ram, kick butt graphics/video cards, and have more hard drive space than any other laptop from gateway, intel, compaq,Spartan, Toshiba, or Dell. (DELL is probably the crapiest computer you can ever buy, thats why college's and schools have them. because they can't afford better one's."
3,Buyer beware--glass may shatter when shipping,"My wife and I looked everywhere for a decent priced TV stand. We didn't find anything we liked and w/in our budget at Best Buy or Circuit City (plus, they usually mark up accessories and furniture to a ridiculous level). We were excited about this one when we saw it, but were soon disappointed after receiving the delivery. I had unpacked almost the entire unit before realizing the entire glass top was shattered! I opened a claim with UPS and requested a refund from the etailer, but wanted to issue a warning. Hopefully ours was the exception, and you receive yours with no problem, but be aware."
4,Very good!,This TV stand is very good. Price is ok but could be cheaper...Appearance is good and it is just a bit of work to assemble it.
1,"Arrived damage, took 3 months for refund","When the stand arrived, all 3 panes of glass were broken. I immediately contacted the seller (gizmosforlife), who was responsive at first, but did not refund my money in a timely fashion."
4,Beautiful monitor & a fantastic deal,"I bought this beauty at Circuit City for $199 the Friday after Thanksgiving and I love it. The crisp, clear images are incredible as well as the space saving design vs my old boat anchor 17"" CRT. Buy one & you'll be happy too...."
1,Died right after the warranty expired.,"Purchased from a local big box office supply store. It refused to produce a picture after about 13 months or so, right after the warranty expired. The local big box office supply store said I had to contact Samsung, which I did by email. It took well over a month to get a response back. By then I had replaced it with a monitor from another manufacturer. My experience with the Samsung brand on several products has been horrible and I will (hopefully) never own another Samsung product in my life."
3,Too Bright !!!,"I picked up this monitor on Black Friday. I had no problems setting it up, but it's too bright for my taste. When I try to turn down the brightness the whites become tinged with blue. And the text didn't seem all that crisp, no matter if I tried to manually adjust the setting or do the Auto. Even though I got it for a good price, it's still too bright for me and will be going back to the store. What a shame."
1,Not what Strauss wrote,"Regrettably, Mr. deLancie proves he's not up to this piece. Rather than playing what Strauss wrote, he changes it in order to make it less challenging. Such disrespect for the composer's intentions is appalling, even if he was the person who gave the composer the idea to write the piece.He didn't like the piece, and apparently told Strauss of this, after the piece had been sent to him as a gift. So if you don't like the piece AND you're not up to it, don't perform it and PLEASE don't record it.The disrespect shown for the composer's intentions on this recording is shameful."
2,No magic between them,"Sounded like a good story. Older, cynical man and woman who had been denied the fun things in life. But the story did not capture or hold my interest. The ""pretend"" courtship between Meg Sutton and Johnny Trevore wasn't even believable.Wrendale started out an interesting character but he wimped out too fast. For being so cynical he changed his tune too quickly. There was not a lot of emotion or passion between Meg and Johnny. They just seemed to fall in love without any interacton at all!Marden was pretty ingenious as a villain and was worthy of note. The most appealing character by far was Johnny's mistress Patsy Billington! A quick light read. Not much to offer."
4,The Closing Chapter of a Stellar Life,"At Eighty-Two is an incredible though painful final journal from Sarton. If you are reading Sarton for the first time, read Journal of a Solitude or (my favorite) Recovering first, and then turn to this one. Sarton deals in this journal primarily with the diminishment of old age. Being quite ill at the time, she occassionally comes accross quite bitter, but perhaps this is what makes this journal so poignant and so important for a society that either forgets about or romantizes old age."
1,A cultic view.,"West is a devotee of Straussianism, that anti-historical school of Founders-worship whose influence is so slight among historians while its voice, thanks to wealthy right-wingers' subsidies (such as through the Heritage Foundation), is so loud. Thus, for example, he assumes throughout that the Constitution somehow is related to the Declaration. Just read Madison's notes on the debates in the Philadelphia Convention and see how often the Framers (note: not the same as the Founders, _pace_ West) mentioned living up to the Declaration. The Ratifiers, the Founders whose views count on this score, cared about this idea even less. This is a lame book: the few men whose works West has combed are unrepresentative of their times (he ignores Clinton, Henry, R.H. Lee, _et al._), yet even their own lives don't verify his arguments. If you want to learn something about the origins of the U.S. constitution, start with Bernard Bailyn or Gordon Wood -- who don't get by on right-wing subventions."
1,Not a good read,"Dr. West has a very wishy-washy argument, arguing against the ideas that blacks, women, and the poor enjoyed life, liberty, and happiness at the founding. He argues the point that the Founding Fathers BELIEVED in TRUE EQUALITY for all, and he proves his point by using the writings of the founders. However, the simple proclamation of principles does no good for society when they are not carried out. He only goes on to explain WHY the Founders could not carry out their principles.This book is very heavy on the philosophical/principled side of politics, and very lacking in it's examination of the actions undertaken at the founding. I'm only reading the book because it's for my politics class (at the university where he teaches. . . I wonder why we had to buy it. . $$$)"
5,An Antidote for Common Anachronisms,"Did the Founders think that blacks were morally and intellectually inferior? Yes, most of them did. Did the Founders think that blacks were still fully entitled to the unalienable rights of man? Yes, most of them did. Were intellectual and social debates as multifaceted then as now. You bet. That's why it is possible to find facts and quotations to support a variety of assaults on the Founders, based on selective evidence and anachronistic, collectivist values. This book looks at the people and the circumstances of the founding period in light of the individualist values of the time and the social conflicts and necessities those people had to reconcile. The mere fact that they created a nation more free and more fair than any that had gone before should make us doubt the malign, revisionist, politically-correct histories we've seen in recent decades. This book is not only very good, but much needed."
5,Just what I needed.,"Just what I needed. Came in good time for study before school started. Condition as desribed, no complaints for this book."
4,Grip-rite,It was what I wanted at the write price. Gun works well and feels good in my hand. Have not had an jams or feed problems.
2,freshman flop,"i really like julie doiron's music, but this album is pretty disappointing. since it's her first, it's not too surprising, but it really wasn't recorded too long before her other albums. her voice sounds like a chipmunk, and her songwriting is still very undeveloped. i recommend ""heart + crime"" instead, or if you prefer hearing her in french, ""desormais""."
5,"A cerebral, engaging, fascinating film.","David Hare's The Designated Mourner starring Mike Nichols, Miranda Richardson, and David de Keyser, is based on a play by Wallace Shawn. Told almost entirely in direct address, the film is a genuinely original, intimate, and compelling viewing experience of the sort as Wallace Shawn's earlier triumph, My Dinner with Andre (written and performed with Andre Gregory). The Designated Mourner is a cerebral, engaging, fascinating film that will be reflected upon long after the closing credits run. Color, 95 minutes."
5,"An impressive, intimate, compelling entertainment.","Told almost entirely in direct address to the viewer, The Designated Mourner is the feature film version of the Wallace Shawn stageplay and presents an impressive series of performances by the case which includes Mike Nichols, Miranda Richardson, and David de Keyser. Intimate, compelling, at times disturbing, The Designated Mourner is an original concept that is as enthralling as Shawn's earlier work, My Dinner With Andre and is highly recommended for personal, film school, and public library video collections. VHS, color, 95 minutes,"
4,how many times one can go in circles,not being sure what/whom lead some to argue about the protagonist's transition from high- to low-brow. if this transition had anything to do with this movie it must have happened before since jack is nothing else but a pretentious low-brow pal who's faking his way around. otherwise a nerve-test: excellent interpretation around a low screenplay.
3,Don't think it helped.,"The back of bottle read use ""no more than 10 days"" at a time. Then What? How long do you wait to use it again? Plus the spray, sprayed more around my mouth than in the mouth."
4,"Finally a book (too short), for women's vital energy!!","I was happy to find a book that took into consideration not only a womans libido, but also the positive effects on bone density, loss of vital energy, fatigue, heart, diminished sense of well being, reduction in muscle tone, atrophy, inability to climax, incontinence, etc.etc. Too many doctors are ready to put women on anti-depressants feeling that these things are mostly psychological rather than hormonal in going through the menopause. Susan Rako says Testosterone may be the key!!! Its been known for years what the lack of, can do to men, but it seems women have been ignored. Plus I liked the fact that Susan speaks from her own personal experience. I was thrilled to find this information and agree that it can make a tremendous difference. . This is a small book written fairly simply, but could have been more in depth and detailed, but definitely worth the reading. D.T."
4,Good read,"This is the first Nero Wolfe book that I've read, although I have seen the dramatatizations that have been done on television. I enjoyed these, and I enjoyed this book. Wolfe is an eccentric and he is wonderfully portrayed. In this book he and his sidekick Archie are on their way to a gourmet cook convention in West Virginia. This is something in itself because Wolfe rarely leaves his home in New York City. He solves most of his crimes from there, close to his orchids and his own wonderful cook. Wolfe is a gourmet, and food drives everything he does. The mystery is intricate, and the story here is lots of fun. I do need to read more of Rex Stout's wonderful character. This is a sign of a good author, when one of his characters makes it into folklore, and becomes a household name, like Nero Wolfe is."
3,Slapstick Wolfe,"This is a landmark Wolfe mystery for the true fan, but new readers may find it dated, with a thin plot. It is Stout's first real shot at playing Wolfe for laughs, and also marks Archie's emergence as a mature and witty observer- unlike the more naive Goodwin of previous books (eg The Rubber Band, The Red Box) for whom the heroine is out-of-reach. The setting is farcical but still has a nice 30s period feel."
4,The real Rex Stout is always a good read,"I like his characters. Usually, in books, this is what draws or repels me to different writers. The people I meet in the book. The regulars.Most of the Nero Wolfe series is super.This particular story started off, or rather, grew to get a bit confusing to me at first. There seemed to be exactly what the title proclaims, too many cooks. And I wasn't particularly interested in the reason for all of them meeting that way.Once I got the various people sorted out, though, it was an enjoyable read...but as I just said, I enjoy the main characters. This is really why I keep all of Rex Stout's Wolfe series, though one needs to be certain, it's not always shown, whether he actually did write some later titles, or they were written by someone else, posthumously to Stout. This one is by Stout, and I will say that some of the posthumous ones are pretty good, too.The mystery here is up to his usual standards, and that's really what draws us, before we meet the characters."
5,Just beautiful. A very special recording.,The sound quality of this CD belies the age of the recording. It is vivid and very much alive. Be careful with the volume control though because the guns tend to be quite explosive.
2,shoe review,"I bought these because I was looking for a dress boot in a 13 Wide, and almost noone carries them in my size. The boots look nice, but the soles are very slick and can be somewhat dangerous. Also, the front of the boot fits good, but the heel and ankle are loose and do not fit snug enough for them to be comfortable for a long period of time or for walking any distance."
3,Don't buy from Bargain Outfitters,"Bought this item from Bargain Outfitters. This is the last tme I buy from them. They listed the shipping weight as 2 pounds. I accordingly bought the item from them and had it freght forwarded to my overseas address. It turned out that they provided false information. the shipping weight was twice as much and I had to pay accordingly twice as much overseas shipping. When I contacted them about it they were telling me they are sorry I thought the shipping weight was different, in effect informing me that I do not know how to read their specific shipping weight ino they provide on Amazon. They refuse their mistake and would not provide a good business gesture of waiving the already charged shipping weight. I do not trust someone who provides false info and does not admit it."
1,Plastic!,"IT IS JUST A PLASTIC CUP!!!!!!VERY CHEAP.!! NEVER BUY IT!!!! I'd say that when i see the pic i think it was glass, when i receive it, I cant believe that i purchase for such a plastic cup, and if i return it, i should pay more for the shipment!!!"
4,Glasses Are Huge,"Just so you know, the glasses looked exactly as pictured and they're huge. My hubby and I use them in our picnic basket so no problems for us."
1,Blue Hawaii-Elvis Presley,"A wonderful Movie , probably only beaten by ""Fun In Acapulco"".The Scenes, the story line, and the Stars are wonderful,even the ""Problem Child"".But above all of these are the songs-all great Hits.Most memorable ""KU-U-I-PO, I love you more today than yesterday"".The final scene of the Movie is a piece of stirring WeddingArrangement and Photography, and then the final fabulous Song-""The Hawaiian Wedding Song"" in both English and Hawaiian,also beautifully sung by Don Ho and Andy Williams.I was delighted to have the Soundtrack for my iPod.Thank you, Amazon.Dr Frank."
2,Silly And Trite,"I read this book as a young man in the 80's and couldn't remember it so I bought it for my kindle. I now know why I didn't remember it, because it is beyond silly.The plot sounds like it could be interesting, but Mr. Block turned it into one boring read. The mystery aspect is easy to spot and the characters are cardboard at best. I actually found myself wanting the plane to blow up and kill them all."
3,WCW Hog Wild 1996,"It was ok, but the main event really sucked! ""Hollywood"" Hulk Hogan vs. Giant for the WCW world heavyweight title. The cruiserweight title match was good between Rey Mysterio, Jr. and Ultimo Dragon. The Luger-Sting, Outsiders match was pretty good. That was the match when Nick Patrick turned NWO. Some of the other matches were Harlem Heat vs. Steiner Bros.(Tag Team Championship), Ric Flair vs. Eddie Guerreo(U.S. title), Medusa vs. Bull Nakano, Ice Train vs. Scott Norton, Chris Benoit vs. Dean Malenko(really long). Overall the event was pretty good, buy it for something old to watch and to see the NWO just after they formed."
4,Fairly decent,"It opened with Mysterio Vs. Ultimo Dragon, which really had it's moments..the bike match with Medusa was great, and the Harlem Heat Vs. The Steiner Brothers was outstanding. The conclusion left a little to be desired..Hogan Vs. Giant could have been more."
2,Not very good,Hogan wins the world title from the Giant. Dead main event in front of a dead crowd. Awful! A couple of good matches in the undercard are the only matches worth watching.
4,The First of the Great WCW vs NWO war PPV's,"This video has some steller matchs on it Rey jr vs ultimo dragon for the cruiserweight title is a brillient opener, the tag team/U.S. title mathes are both fantastic, Benoit vs Malenko is a classic and the doubel main event of The Outsiders vs Lex Luger and Sting and Hollywood Hogan vs The Giant for the world title are marvelous.The only two matches that suck are the borering Scott Nortton vs Ice Train Match and Maduser's talat is wasted in a poitless gimike Bash the Bike match aginst Bull Nakano but other wise a great way to start the WCW vs NWO war"
4,o.k,"it was a fair ppv.if your a nWo fan you will love it,coz the nwo's hall&nash beat sting&luger and hogan captured the title buy defeating the Giant. those 2 matches ruled."
2,Couldn't get into it,"As my title states, I just couldn't get into this book, even though I work with kids. I didn't finish it. I thought it was sad that the school's success rate with the kids wasn't much better than the prison system's success rate. It seemed that the school administration was proud of the fact that they didn't have any professional counseling for the kids, and I'm not so sure that's something to be proud of."
3,Check you ATV befoire ordering.,Unit arrived quickly and in perfect condition. As far as spreaders it is well made and should hold up quite well. One issue I occurred was the attaching of the unit to my ATV. All parts supplied to attach were designed for a tubular rack. My ATV has a hard plastic flat rack both in the front and rear. I could have modified unit to work but spending this money deterred me from that. I had no guarantees my modifications would work. I noticed also that installing this spreader to an ATV kept spreader rather high up in the air. Sure this will increase broadcasting distance but also appeared that driver of ATV would be hit with whatever material was being broadcast. It spreads in the complete circular pattern requiring a guard of some type to prevent material from hitting ATV and driver.
4,Earthway does the job,"I purchased the spreader to use on my food plots. It did spread seeds, fertilizer and other things of this nature with ease an uniformly. But substances like lime would have a tendancy the bind up and not flow. It did take considerable modification to make it fit on my quad. But once on it was a solid performer."
2,"It works, but with some side effects","I used the Xyience extreme am fat burner last year and it definately helps and works, I definately lost weight using it, but the two side effects that I found with it and would never have me using it again was it made my heart race alot, and when I tried to go to sleep at the end of the day I couldn't because of my heart racing. It also made me feel light headed and a burning sensation in my stomach from time to time. I would definately ask a doctor before using this stuff"
3,Badly in need of editing,"I dictated substantial portions of this casebook onto cassette for a blind law student through a program maintained by the University of Denver. This caused me to pay close attention to what I was reading. Although the book is comprehensive and well-written, it has been poorly edited in terms of grammatical errors and other blatant typographical mistakes that should have been caught before publication. The book is full of such errors, including HTML tags that were never edited out, incomplete or run-on sentences, and sentences that just don't make sense gramatically. Let us hope that the Third Edition will receive better scrutiny from a copy editor."
5,One of the BEST Fourth Way Books to come in a long time,"For many of us Gurdjieff and Uspenskii have remained mysteriously attractive but dauntingly difficult to grasp. Struggle of the Magicians is a 'hard to put down' exception to much of the literature available about Gurdjieff, presenting his life and work almost like a play against the panoramic backdrop of his turbulent times, from World War I and the Russian Revolution through World War II.The central focus of the book is the sacred, archetypal relationship of the Master and disciple. An intimate view is given of Gurdjieff's work with his students including many who, like the famous Uspenskii, were unwilling to pay the price. This revealing look at the roles of Guru and disciple in the compelling work of self-transformation makes the book of special interest and value to those on any path."
2,Not good!,Not as good as I thought it would be. The action is slow and the final fight is too long and boring. If the fighting was exciting I wouldn't care how long the final fight was.
3,"Carom movie instead of pool, but similar story to most pool movies","Not a bad movie, kind of average.There are some funny moments and some decent shot making, based around 3 cushion carom instead of pool makes a change but the story wavers a bit from time to time.There is a nice twist at the end...."
1,Don'T Bother,"All I can say is, this sucks. The only concert video has no audio, only narration. I was very disappointed. Don't waste your money."
3,The established way to engage contact with the great western,This is about depth and emotion. It really established a way to engage contact with the past and retrieve the great western life with a sense of feeling that you were there and dealing with the evey day problems of the community's life.
4,Quite Tasty and a Great Deal here,This is a very tasty soup; interesting textures/crunchiness you don't usually find in a rehydrated soup. It's a much better deal than buying individually at a store. I definitely recommend it as a snack; it doesn't have enough calories for a meal.
4,Early James Mason thriller is still entertaining!,"I'm a big fan of James Mason & here you get to see one of his earliest movies. The plot is pretty simple: two young schoolteachers take a walk after a bad storm & get lost. James Mason finds them & brings them to his house which is somewhat isolated from the rest of civilization! At his house the two women learn that Mason is a composer & a bitter veteran of the Spanish Civil War. The piano playing scenes with Mason aren't convincing at all but the music is great! The women also learn that a friend of theirs who's been missing for months had a relationship with Mason, & from there the tension builds & builds until the ending which has a surprise twist. Is Mason a murderer or a framed man? Watch this movie & find out! While the acting from the other cast members is a little too over-the-top, James Mason is terrific (as usual) & makes this worth watching. This is even more fun on a rainy night!"
2,Old fashioned overblown Carmen,"I grew up in the 70's and got to know Carmen through Solti's recording, one of his better non-Wagner recordings. Since then, my prefered version is the matchless Berganza/Abbado recording in DG, certainly the most beautiful and stylish of all. A friend recommended the Reiner recording and I was curious enough to buy it. This is an old fashioned Carmen, that takes us back to the 50's when Carmen was thought ""a Grand Opera"" rather than an Opera Comique with dialogues. To me, this sounds too much like Cavalleria Rusticana, loud and a little vulgar. For a more stylish 1950's Carmen, I much prefer the Victoria de Los Angeles/ Beecham recording."
1,I am annoying,I am very upset because the picture shows that the brand label Motex but they sent me a Gold Star brand MX 550 for the same price
4,Fun. Unique. Durable.,"I bought these to take backpacking since they are made of a laminate they are waterproof. Played Rummy with them and they performed well. Dropped a card accidentally in the snow and picked it right up, dried it off and good as new. They do stick together a bit as temps become colder or if they are a bit wet but it doesn't hurt the cards themselves.Buy these if you are looking for a fun, unique and durable solution to passing the time camping or backpacking.FYI, for those ultralight backpack/campers this card set is a bit heavier than a traditional set of playing cards but I think the durability makes up for that.Have FUN!"
4,Can't find them,"I thought the idea of invisible playing cards sounded so cool. But after we took them out of the case, we could never find them again."
2,Fun but bad quality,"I hate writing a negative review....But sometimes it needs to be done. When I first opened the box I noticed the plastic case that comes with the cards seemed to be sturdy, hard to open, but sturdy. After playing a couple games of poker with the cards I noticed the cards were developing tiny little cracks, I can tell they will not last long.They are also very slipper, which isn't a HUGE problem, but can be a little annoying.The cards look nice and feel nice.Overall, If i had it to do over again, would not buy them.I doubt they will last too many more times of shuffling.."
3,"Very nice cards, but...","I got this deck in the mail pretty fast. The cards themselves are very cool, and work great for playing in the water. However, the cards that I got were entirely grey and orange. The corners were also slightly bent. They're also insanely hard to shuffle, and, if you're a card flourisher, they do not fan AT ALl (well, they're plastic). They spring quite nicely, though. Aside from the color problem, they're good cards. A bit pricy, though."
5,Love it,My daughter loves these cards and I would recommend it to others. I love how it comes in a plastic case not like the regular cards that come in a paper box.
5,My favorite shoes!,"I've had these Privos for years and years, and they've held up phenomenally. Always comfortable, they have seen me around Europe and the U.S., coast, mountains and city. The neutral color is ideal for most uses, although I also have a pair in black (and another model in coral - fun!)"
4,Possibly the most comfortable shoes ever,"Just got back from a trip to Europe and walked everywhere in these shoes or the same shoes in black.If you're looking for the perfect amount of cushion in the sole, these are the shoes. Usually when I go on vacation my shoes give me blisters from all of the walking, but these didn't do a shread of harm.Like someone else said, this particular pair has little sensi points in the insole, but I think they might have helped to stimulate the bottoms of my feet and kept them comfortable.I highly recommend these shoes."
4,A Diamond in the Rough,"The Sandman is very simply, an island of musical originality in an industry of over-produced, studio-manufactured trite. A lyrical genius, his unique blend of folk, rap & country is a refreshing change to the stagnant waters of country/western music, and manages to magically combine 2 genres which have been at war for years.This album focuses specifically on his folk talents, and seems to pay homage to the classic country music of the past (as opposed to the pop-stylings of today). No folk, or country collection is complete without this diamond in the rough.Looking for more information on Sandman or his other albums? You can visit his website at www.rappincowboy.com"
2,A serious disappointment.,"I have really enjoyed listening to this artist. She has the talent to create interesting lyrics, beautiful music and the ability to fuse them together to make great music. However, her latest album is a bust. There are a few songs in this album that show her potential (In this Life, being one.) All the rest of her songs seem very uninspired. The music is very boring, and old and her lyrics and music just don't go well together. Before she used to explor multiple themes in her albums. This album is only about love. I hope that her next album is more inspired with some of the passion she has shown before."
3,world seems better under these rocks and stones,"I bought this album the day of its release, having known and loved Chantal's music for years. However, I was quite taken back that none of the songs really captured me much like her former two albums had. ""In This Life"" is beautiful, yes, but does not compare to ""Surrounded"", ""Wayne"", ""Eve"", or many others. Some of the other tracks seem like growers, but her voice just doesn't shine on this record, it's like she's almost trying to be dark, but it's just not her. I hope that I will eventually grow to like more songs on this album, but as for now...it's not on heavy rotation."
4,Bonus track is good,the japanese bonus tracks are really attractive.the price is horrible~buy a original one instead
2,Not As Good As Previous CD's,"I ordered her new CD directly from Canada with high anticipation, as I loved her first 2 CD's and saw her twice live. However, I was disappointed with this CD. It doesn't have the emotion of ""Under These Rocks and Stones"" nor does it have the pop polish of ""Colour Moving and Still"". It seems her 3 year layoff didn't help her with songwriting."
1,More of the same,"Chantal's 1996 debut, ""Under These Rocks and Stones"", showed her promise as a talented singer/songwriter. Then, with 1999's ""Colour Moving and Still"", she collaborated far too much with her husband and the end result was a boring and pretty disappointing album. Unfortunately, 2002's ""What If It All Means Something"" is pretty much the same. Chantal and Raine Maida might make a great team as a couple, but as songwriters I fail to see how they click. Also, Chantal's singing is quite annoying and scratchy and I honestly have a hard time listening to her. I am sure most Chantal fans will love this, but I've lost respect for her as an artist with her latest album."
3,Not her best..,"In some person's review they said that Chantal Kreviazuk could use some songwriting lessons from her husband. What that person didn't realize was that Raine Maida (her husband) collaborated in composing many of the songs on ""What If It all Means Something"", and Raine Maida has been getting quite a bit of criticism of late for becoming too mainstream with Our Lady Peace's latest effort ""Gravity"". Sure Raine Maida might seem to be faring better musically, but the truth is they are both converging into a more mainstream market. ""Under These Rocks and Stones"" and ""Colour, Moving, and Still"" were brilliant, whereas ""What If It All Means Something"" is definitely not as good.Just to add, Chantal Kreviazuk is not better than Avril Lavigne. If you listened to Chantal's debut and sophomore records you would realize that."
3,*,"In the U.S, Chantal Kreviazuk has had far more soundtrack appearances than radio play. Judging from the slickly produced and instantly digestible tracks that stuff ""What if it all Means Something,"" it seems as though she's finally figured out what's paying her bills.Gone are the darker shadings of her earlier work; every song on this disc sounds as though it's been intentionally written and recorded for an upcoming Julia Roberts flick. (The aforementioned redhead is quite literally the subject matter of one song -- an irony not lost on me.)The resulting material is evocative, accessible, and often quite pleasant... but ultimately hollow.Save this one for road trips w/ gal pals."
3,I wanted to love it but..............,"I have been waiting for her third CD hoping for great things. I really liked how raw and edgy the first CD was but I felt the second was even better. I return to that CD often. She really digs deep into her writing. She is softer and more vulnerable in Colors, Moving and Still. I was hoping she would come up with something special in the new CD but most of the songs really don't catch fire. There are a few good songs, like the title track, but otherwise the new one is NOT the CD that will put her on the map.By the way, I am still recovering from a very wierd Grammy's show. Did Nora Jones really deserve 8 awards ???"
4,Thanx Avril,"Living in the UK, I have never heard of Chantel before. It wasn't until I bought Avril's latest album 'Under my skin' that the name Chantel so and so (lol) came up as she had helped Avril write many of the tracks on the album. And although I don't think she is as good as Avril, I think she has a great voice and would do well in the UK with this musix. U GO GIRL!"
4,Fabulous Album,Chantal Kreviazuk's music finds a way into both your heart and your mind. After hearing her songs in a movie I was bound and determined to own her albums.
3,Not what I expected,I caught Chantal on telly doing a concert and fell in love!!! I bought this CD and it is a disappointment to what I saw and listened to. Perhaps her others are better. . .
5,Inspiring and exciting collection of writing...,"I just sat down with ""Pieces of Me,"" and I couldn't put it down! I loved going from page to page not knowing what I would read about next. The writers are young girls with amazing ideas and writing style, and there are also submissions by their mentors - female writers of all ages. A must have for anyone who loves to write."
5,An inspiration,"I could not believe the blunt, truthful, creative, insightful pieces from the girls in this book! It's hard to believe that some of them are only teenagers. This book has inspired me to dig out my journal, open my heart, and write without censoring myself!"
2,Not for Beginners,I don't agree with other reviewers that this is a beginner video. The second workout has some advanced yoga poses with little instruction. The Pilates workout also contains some advanced Pilates exercises. Denise is calmer in this video than other videos. The production quality is also very nice. A great introduction to Pilates on video is Stott's Essential Matwork and Lynne Robinson's Body Control. Even better take a class and then try the videos at home.
4,Wonderful Video from Denise,"I have purchased a few of Denise's videos in the past and they all were just so-so. This however, is wonderful. Her calm soothing (yes, it is Denise) voice and great instruction are a plus. I give this four stars due to the fact that the second session is a little hard on the wrists. Thanks to this video, after 3 weeks of doing it 5 days a week, I have lost 12 pounds and my abs, legs, arms and buttocks are much firmer and toned. I love the way I feel after completing the short 20 minute workouts and the results speak for themselves! I reccommend this video to anyone who is just starting to practice Yoga and/or Pilates, and also for those who are advanced. (She offers more challenging variations of the moves throughout the sessions.)"
1,This video is a joke,"I've been doing pilates and yoga for six months now and I have never seen a poorer approach to these two types of exercise. Denise does not seem to know what she is doing, nor is she able to explain these exercises to the viewer. I'm not sure why she is so popular, she talks to the camera like her audience was a bunch of 4 year olds and she has poor form in both of the 20 minute sessions on this tape. In the pilates section she does a number of basic pilates exercises and a couple more advanced ones, but her constant breathy and airheaded commentary ruins your concentration and focus on the breath. I was unable to contain my laughter when she would say ridiculous things like, ""Thats gooooood, you are like a ballerina!!"" And the yoga section is a total mess. She does a poor version of sun salutations with out explaining the movements.For anyone who is seriously interested in practicing pilates or yoga, you are better off spending your money elsewhere."
1,"Annoying, too fast, and bad technique","As someone who does yoga regularly, I was struck with Denise Austin's terrible technique, at least in the yoga section (I am less familiar with Pilates). Her speed does not allow you to actually get into the poses and her constant chatter is highly irritating. A beginner would not get the instruction he or she would need and may even learn bad technique. I will not use this tape again and would not recommend it to anyone I care about."
1,What a faker,"I was lent this tape by someone new to Pilates. I have been doing Pilates for 6 years and was amazed to find that D. Austin (who is an Aerobics diva) has a Pilates tape. Her technique is horrible and she does not come close to hitting on the ""core"" needed to complete the excerises correctly. The sequence in which Pilates movements are completed is extremely important and Ms. Austin jumps all over the place. Not knowing much about Yoga I do know that one does not rush through the movements and that proper positioning of the body is crucial. I do not beleive this is accomplished. There is a great web site out there where one can purchase tapes and small Pilates equipment from the leading manuafacturer of Pilates equipment. Do your body a favor and find a great Pilates tape on a Pilates web site! P.S. My sister is a ballet dance, did the tape with me once and Ms. Austin drove her crazy with her voice tone and ""ballarina"" lingo! I must concur!"
2,Over-rated!!,"Sound quality is awful - you can hardly hear it - very disappointing. The only part of the DVD I'll really use is in the Bonus Section for hips, thighs and buttocks."
3,Kinda fast but we'll see,"I have only used this video a few times so perhaps my opinion will change...but I found that Denise does go a bit quickly through some of the important elements of Pilates. She's constantly instructing you to ""lengthen and stretch"" but doesn't quite explain how to do that. The pace of the entire workout was a bit fast and consequently, I'm not sure if I'm spending enough time on each exercise to make a difference. The other reviews seem mixed on Denise's persona, but I found her tone annoying. Her baby voice really grates on me. Howevever, I can say that after each workout, I can feel a difference in my abs. I am going to keep trying the video and perhaps I will feel differently after a while."
4,really like this one,I like to do this at least twice a week. This workout just feels good. The first 20 minute workout is easier than the second one. Mixing it with three days of one of denise's cardio programs makes a pretty good workout week.
1,a case of bad Pilates,The quality of the instructions as well as the demonstrations are very poor in this video. Pilates is not something one picks up in a minute. it requires extensive studying and practice. None of these qualities are visible in this video. It gives a distorted idea of what the Pilates philosophy is about.
2,More like 'Pilates takes aerobics',"Denise Austin is usually great, but her aerobics background is definitely a minus when it comes to Pilates. I've watched a few Pilates tapes, and smooth careful movements are usually emphasized. In this tape, Ms. Austin goes through each exercise quickly without the usual care about stretching, moving to lengthen the muscles, etc. I guess this is a good intro to Pilate's for the aerobics croud, but it seems to miss the point of the Pilate's technique!"
2,Not for beginners,"I thought Denise Austin would have a good work-out for people just starting pilates/yoga, but I was wrong. Luckily, I had already been doing yoga for a few months and knew how to safely do the poses in the yoga section of this workout, but it made me nervous how fast she was taking it and with very little instruction. Yoga is more than just getting into a position. It's linking movement and breath and balance. I have not done any other Denise Austin work-outs, but I get the impression that she quickly learns every new fitness fad that comes along so she can do her own video/DVD of it. I would rather learn the pilates method from someone who has studied and practiced it for years."
1,"Denise Austin-Mat Workout Based on the Work of J.H.Pilates,","I am a certified Pilates Instructor and I think that the quality of the instructions, not to mention the demonstrations are very poor. Whoever buys this video tape to learn about the Pilates method will get a very distorted picture of what this philosophy is about. The way the exercises are being performed leave a lot to be desired. The full body awarness is missing here.The question of quality control arises. If there is none, anyone can record a video tape. When people buy an exercise VHS they expect the instructions to be the highest quality they can get.They trust that the person making the video is highly qualified to do so. Recently there has been a disturbing number of ""cases of bad Pilates"". It is very unfortunate that this fine method of exercising that requires the instructors to go through an extensive trainng is being devaluated by people who do not care about quality."
2,This is a mess....,"This was the first pilates DVD I bought and her instruction and technique was not very explanatory. For those who are serious about the correct posture, stance and breathing in pilates (especially breathing which done incorrectly will get you no where fast), look into Mari Windsor Pilates. She gives outstanding instruction, shows you in 3 D format what the correct form should be and instructs you on the all important breathing. www.windsorpilates.com"
3,"TOUGH, TOUGH, TOUGH","I enjoy Denise's tapes, but I am still new to the exercise world. After trying several of her other tapes recently, I tried these 2 workouts. The first workout here is not easy, but doable. The second workout, was too hard for me. I would suggest it only if you are in good shape. I watched about 3-5 minutes and then she had us on a foot and a hand, and my arm literally collapsed. They are great workouts, but very difficult."
1,Annoying,"If you like Denise Austin, then stop reading right here. I love the Pilates workouts, and was hoping that with a video instructor I could get some better tips on form and movement since there are no Pilates studios where I live. Unfortunately for me, I find Denise Austin's voice quality grating. I watched the video twice, once to get a feel for what she does, and a second time to see if I could stand her. It's still sitting on my shelf."
3,Mixed feelings,"As a couple of others have said, I liked part one of this tape which is fairly slow paced and relaxing, but did not like part two, which goes too fast for the exercises involved, and which has an odd pseudo-soothing tone. I bought this tape and another related one because I had bought the related book and liked it. I do think she has toned down some of her usual chirpiness (sp) for these tapes, which is good, because it would not fit these types of exercises."
1,Aerobic Pilates,"Pilates is program that began as a physical therapy and rehabilitation program almost 100 years ago, although it is currently the ""fitness rage"". This video does demonstrate some of the positions and postures (there are over 200) but they are performed at high speed and the Pilates technique is never explained. Pilates should be performed in a deliberate, flowing, smooth way. The transitions in the video were too fast and choppy and reminded me of aerobics instead of yoga or ballet. A certified Pilates instructor will tell you that the exercises take some time to perfect and that form, not repetitions, is important. While it is based on the work of Joseph Pilates, this video is just a variation on Denise's other videos."
2,Pass on this Pilates Workout,I wanted to try Pilates and I came across this tape (I decided to give Denise a chance even thoughI cannot stand her voice!) The bottom line: I did not like this tape. She breezed through the exercises! She looked wobbly and uncoordinated in the second half of the video. I'm going to try Pilates for Dummies and see how I like it.
5,Fitness DVD,I've used this DVD for years and have since bought it for many friends as we all love the simplicity of it and feel so great after doing it!
3,Watch it a few times first,"There are two 20-minute workout videos on this DVD. A Pilates mat workout and a yoga workout.I like the pilates mat routine and feel like my abs receive a good workout by the end of it. The moves can be a bit awkward for beginners and Denise does not always describe them well enough for me to transition into the next move/position without looking up at the tv. My neck sometimes feels a little strained from my frequent adjustments to see the tv screen.I did not enjoy the yoga workout at all. I found the moves to be very difficult for a yoga newbie like myself. I have some balance related issues due to a problem with one of my ankles and I struggled to keep my balance during some of the moves.Lastly, the tone of Denise's voice on this DVD is not soothing to me at all. Her voice reminds me of Jim Carrey's Vera De Milo character on the show Living Color (a bad attempt at a Marilyn Monroe impersonation)."
4,Good Product,This DVD was recommended by my sister and I can say that it really hits the mark. I use this when I'm on business trips and it is great for a change in pace.
3,So-so,"I don't know what I was expecting but pilates is more the type of exercise for toning/maintaining an already fit body. I was more looking for something to improve my fitness and this dvd wasn't it. It consists of 2 pilates workouts, the second being harder although I often do both in a row since they're only 20 min each. Everyone can benefit from pilates since it improves your balance and flexibility so I certainly did get something out of it. It's just not my favorite workout dvd by any means since I prefer upbeat, engaging workouts rather than slow-paced ones. But again, that's me not knowing what I was buying in advance. I think Denise is an ok instructor - she has a very soothing voice but not much personality. Not that I wanted a sassy instructor but a little bit of personality would be good. The workouts themselves weren't uber-difficult even for me and I've never done pilates or yoga before. This is an acceptable beginner pilates dvd set~"
4,Love this workout,I really like this DVD. I have back and hip problems. All this stretching feels WONDERFUL.
1,Save your money,"Denise is not a certified Pilates instructor and it shows. She sometimes does not have proper form, and she performs some moves more than necessary. In the yoga video, she is quite wobbly. If you're interested in Pilates or yoga, you will get value for money from videos by Ana Caban, Moira Stott, Hilary Burnett, Jennifer Kries (who combines Pilates, yoga & dance), and the Living Arts yoga videos, among others."
2,Not for beginners,"I had bought this tape and became addicted to Pilates. After some time, I went ahead and bought the Winsor Pilates series. Boy, Denise sure doesn't explain proper technique well! After watching the Winsor basics tape, I realized how I was doing a lot of the moves with very poor technique. I had even strained my back muscle on one of the Denise Austin moves and that still didn't clue me in! I would recommend this tape ONLY for those who know proper technique and are able to adjust their workout with Denise based on their prior knowledge."
3,Not as good as some,"What I didn't like about this video was that Austin does not offer as thorough of an explanation of how your body is supposed to move, relying on you to figure it out from watching. And she does not offer modified versions of the exercise, so I was afraid to try some of the more difficult pilates poses-- which other videos have given me. I definitely think Austin is a great fitness instructor, and man, do I wish I had her abs! But if you're a knucklehead when it comes to workouts, try the Pilates - Mat Based Workout for Beginners instead. The instructor of that one made the exercises more obvious to me, explaining exactly what my body should be doing, and offering a way for me to get started right away, complete the whole workout, get the benefits, but not feel like a clumsy oaf."
4,Excellent Workout,"These are two great workouts for your abs and legs (you'll feel it if you aren't in great shape already). Unfortunately the second 20 minute section is frustrating at first becuase Denise fails to mention to switch legs or relax (and if you are concentrating on holding a certain position, it can throw you off). But the workouts are good and the bonus workout (Shape your buns, thighs and hips) is a nice 10 minute add on for either segement."
5,Great Video,"I LOVE this video!! The first 20 min goes by fast and seem fairly easy. But beleave me ~ you will feel it the next day. This is something I look forward to doing & doesn't feel like a chore. The second 20 min. (yoga/pilates section) is a little challenging, but gives me something to work for. There are days when I can do the full 40 min, but on the days when I only have time for 20 min ~ I know I will get a good workout. Good job Denise. Hope to see more like this."
4,first workout great--second stinks,"I had never done pilates before, and I pretty much stayed away from fitness tapes. The first 20 minute workout was great since i had no idea what I was doing. When I became more advanced and moved on to the second workout on the video, I shut it off after about 10 minutes. She looks totally lost and is moving 90 miles an hour. Very Sloppy job on that workout. Overall though the first workout is great if you have no idea what you are doing. Just don't do this one if you are a little advanced."
4,Not the Best,"This video is definetly for the begginer. I like that she completely takes you through everything, so that you never get lost. Yet, I didn't find that it had a lot of effect on me, probably b/c I'm already a dancer. So, if you're familiar with pilates, I don't recommend it. If you are just looking to start, it's worth a try. Honestly, if you can find a Pilates class in your area, it's really your best option."
5,A great Buy!,I got his a few months ago- Denise Austin has broken down to such a simple way- she makes it easy for anyone to use. I really like it and have seen GREAT results with only 30 minutes a day 3 days a week. This is a Really Good and Easy to understand workout video!
4,It helps...,"This definately increases flexibility if you do it once to twice a week along with stretches and cardio exrcises 4 to 5 times a week. The first time I did the tape, I could not complete all the exercizes. A month later, I could complete them easily. D. Austin can be a little annoying but I got over that pretty fast. This workout will make you sweat and at the same time, it's very relaxing."
4,"Good, but basic","This video consists of two workouts. The first is a very good, basic introduction to pilates. It gave me energy and I could definitely feel my abs working. The exercises made my lower abs work especially hard! This video is not difficult at all, just challenging. She offers modification tips for those of us who are not flexible enough. The second workout is a lot of yoga poses. It is very rushed and a little too fast for someone who has no experience with yoga. There are no explanations for the poses and she seems to think we all know these poses already. I suppose the more you practice, the better you will understand the poses, but I would suggest a different yoga video for beginners. Also Denise Austin's voice is a little annoying, but you'll get used to her calm, breathy voice."
5,Great workout with results!,"I bought this to go along with my yoga workout. I found it to be a great workout that seemed to be easy, but I could feel it working! I enjoy this workout and it pairs great with the yoga!!"
2,Denise Austin - Pilates,"I heard from a friend (who is in her 70's) that this is the best DVD to use when starting yoga, however I did not have a good experience getting the DVD so I can only rate the order experience which was not good. I will probably try reordering but from a different seller. Thank you."
1,BE CAREFUL,"I just received this ""tape"" and am extremely upset with the situation. I did my search under DVD's and clearly only searched for those. Found a used one and they sent me the VHS tape. The price is so cheap for the used one that i would be paying triple what the tape costs to send it back to whomever sold me this from Amazon. Just did the search again and this is exactly the page where I purchased it from. Very Misleading!!!"
2,Denise should stick to aerobics,"I've done many many a pilates tape, and this one ranks low on the list. Denise appears to be a novice just hocking the latest trend in fitness rather than a true practitioner of pilates and/or yoga. In addition to a lopsided workout, her form is off and she leaves out important information - which could cause injury to a beginner...."
1,Dissappointted,"I previously purchased Denise's Ultimate Fat Burner DVD, and I felt like I was in the best shape of my life. But I felt jumping all the time wasn't good for my knees, I then decided to get her Pilates DVD. Something more low-impact on my knees. The first time I tried the DVD; I felt that the DVD was working. After the first time though, it went all downhill with Denise because I didn't feel like I was working at all. I also felt that some of the moves where close to impossible for me to do on her second workout. If you want to get in shape, I strongly don't recommend this DVD."
1,"Give me a 'real ' Pilates instructor,please","After working out from another Pilates instructor,I fould this one hard to take.Then I observed that it was her voice,why is she speaking like she is talking to first graders?I couldn't go on to part 2 cause I felt really annoyed by her presentation.Then I read from another reviewer that she's toned down a bit.Wow,I just like the direct approach and proper instruction.Interesting video. I need to sell this copy."
3,"Good for beginners, bad for experienced pilate or yoga",If you are a beginner or trying a new fitness program it is a good start! When I first started the tapes I did lose some inches off my hip area which is a very bad place for me and I do recommend it to people who want to strengthen their stomaches it does work for those situations. She does have a nasally voice and repeats you can do it too many times so you may need to work on getting past that. For a person who has already experienced pilates or yoga you may want to get another tape. You will know more about pilates and yoga then Denise. I'm a yoga freak so when I seen Denise do warrior pose wrong and plank pose with her rear-end so high in the air and not getting the true ab work-out it made me wonder what else is she doing wrong. I still do the tape to break up my work-outs.
2,i don't think pilates/yoga is ms. austin's strong point,"i've been familiar with denise austin's low-impact aerobic workouts since the 80's when she had a regular show on espn. being a familiar face, i purchased this video to add variety to my collection of yoga tapes and to get introduced to the pilates method. the beginning ads at the start of the tape are very bothersome to fast-forward through. as for her 2 20-minute workouts:the first one is okay for a basic introduction to pilates, but it seemed a bit too brief for me to feel like i got much of a workout. her yoga instruction in the second leaves much to be desired; it would be best to purchase a more proper yoga tape if one wants to get into yoga.i felt i made a mistake in purchasing this video just because i was familiar the instructor. i'm sure there are better pilates-based tapes out there."
3,Good but not great,"I have to admit that Denise Austin is not my favorite workout person, but I have to admit that the first 20 minute section of this workout is wonderful. The second 20 minute section is much harder and I am not able to do most of it. The first 20 minute section I did and really liked it. I definitely felt it the next day. I will continue to do the first section."
1,Not a trained Pilates instructor!,"There are some aspects of this video that are okay, but I was shocked at some of the instruction she gives. Doing the teaser, she uses momentum to ""pop"" into the position, which is not only bad technique but is dangerous and will not use the muscles the exercise is designed for. The 2nd workout includes a lot more yoga than Pilates, and some of the poses are very challenging. With Pilates, it is important to do the exercises correctly, and I don't think Denise Austin really understands Pilates technique. I recommend the Living Arts Pilates videos or Jennifer Kries's Method workout videos."
5,Relaxing & Effective,"This has been one of my favorite workouts for years and was my first introduction to Pilates. In the beginning, the workout was difficult for me to finish but in time, it strengthened my abs and lower back. The DVD is relaxing and effective, there is no annoying music and Denise keeps her talking to a minimum. After about 4 weeks of doing the workout 4-5 times a week, I noticed a marked improvement in my posture and shaved 3 inches from my waist. I was so impressed with the results, that I purchased the Windsor DVDs thinking that they would be even more effective, but they didn't come close. Some reviewers complain that Denise is not a certified Pilates instructor but you can't beat the results that this workout gives in just 20 minutes a day. I highly recommend this classic from Denise Austin."
3,very disappointing,These is one of the better of Denise Austins videos but I am sorry it will be the last one I purchase. She talks to fast and is difficult to follow. Also the volume on this video is too low. I have bought 2 of them so it is the video not my computer
4,Like the simplicity,I was looking for a video that was not hard to do in front of my tv. Denise Austin does this with some great stretching and firming up pilates just the speed for a 52 year old woman who doesn't get out much.
3,Wish I had Bought a Different Album,"A ""young"" listener, I grew up with Whittaker's Farewell album and had high hopes for this one. I wish I had simply bought the original Farewell album, though. Although his voice is excellent (no disappointment there), it is disconcerting to here him sing songs of a genre I don't associate him with. He loses some of the Hemingway-type masculinity on this album but makes a break into muzak. He's still great and maybe it does grow on you. For me, however, I still just skip to the songs that were on the Farewell album."
1,Sorry - I retract my original statement,"Sorry for my review of before. I was trying to make fun of my brother who hammered this CD. He was actually right on the mark....few greatest hits, cheesy toons. Here the WHOLE thing before you buy it."
1,A Major Disappointment !!!!,"I wanted a greatest hits album from this artist because his ""classic"" music reminds me of my dad. I feel that the title is misleading. This is an album of cheesily done broadway tunes with a SMALL sample of his greatest hits (2-3 of them). BOO / HISS.To add insult to injury, I failed to buy this title at Amazon, so I paid too much."
1,Please people....be informed before buying,Please people....be informed before buying. This album blows the big one.Don't be fooled. I'd give it a negative 5 if I could.
2,A reminder that none of us knows everything,"In 1931 this book was cutting edge knowledge of medieval clothing for stage costumers. There is much good in it. However there is much that is just plain wrong. This can be useful in its own way. Those of us interested in clothing history and recreating medieval clothing would do well to look at some things that were ""known"" in 1931 that we now ""know"" to be wrong. It should remind us to be humble about the things we know we ""Know now"" because we may be as far off as much of this book is. It is lots of fun though!"
3,Great for Ideas !,"This is great for ideas. I was was expecting more projects and examples. I wish there was a way to examine the contents of the books before purchasing, like in a book store. I feel like I get ripped off when it is a crummy book."
3,Just guidelines,"It's a nice book, it covers all the areas of the medieval society... but briefly.It has a lot of images, and some sketched patterns, but it's of no great use if you're a newcomer to both medieval clothes and sewing techniques.Used together with some other books, it can come in handy.With goods and bads, it worths its price."
3,Interesting Ideas,"This book, to me, is really neat in that it actually shows you the measurements for simple costume projects."
2,Use with caution!,"Dorothy Hartley's book, first published in 1931, has many good things about it, and also many not-so-good things. The book does have a wealth of black-and-white illustrations reproduced from period sources, and these are outstanding. Ms. Hartley's interpretations of medieval dress, however, are not always on the mark...page 103, for example, has a drawing of a ""sleeveless coat"" which is actually a mis-interpretation of a fur-trimmed sideless surcote. Also confusing is the ""loose side piece"" in her diagram of a hunting tunic on page 57...nothing in the period illustrations would indicate a garment cut and worn that way, and it just doesn't make sense.So...like a lot of other costume texts published in the early 20th century, don't take everything in this book for gospel truth, and double-check the details against other sources if you're looking for true authenticity."
4,"It's a good start to begin from, but the flaws tend to make it a bit strange.","For years I've had a photocopy of this book that I've lugged around, so I was very happy to find this as a reprint edition. One of the great things about this is that the author has done her research, and tends to construct the clothing from simple shapes -- namely if you can sew a straight line, or hem, you can make these costumes. The bad part is that there are some very odd items in here -- one tunic has a flap that ties in place, and the woman's gown is constructed in a very odd way -- you 'can' do it, but the seams look very out of place. Still, the price is good for a begining reinactor, and will instill confidence to go on and make more complicated items."
4,Let's Get Medieval,"I purchased this book in paperback, and it is handy for the no-vice sewing person. Some of the directions are a tad cloudy, asare some of the examples.But keep this in mind: there are not that many actual garmentsto work from that are still extant!!!The garments are pretty much self-explanatory for the novice, and they make for some fairly simple gear to make and wear. AsI have made several veils,wimples, and other assorted headgearfrom the examples in this book, it teaches one the patience andjust WHY clothing was considered so expensive then. We are talking about handsewing EVERYTHING, so even though some of the pieces may be a tad ""off,"" you do learn the basic techniques,as well as valuable practice sewing garments.Having adapted some pieces for streetwear, as they were more comfy than what's out there, and several aprons, as they were morepractical in design, this is a very handy little book to get forthe novice interested in handsewing your own gear."
4,a very good book to know and sew medieval costume,Even if I am french I can use this book to realize medieval costumes. The patterns are very good and the explanations quite easy.
2,Disappointing from the title,"Medieval Costume - yes. Sorta. I guess. She doesn't give much in the way of proof for her costuming conjectures. Lots of drawings and narrative, but really no citations worth mention.How to Recreate it? Not at all. not a bit. Not even so much as a cutting diagram or a single discussion of how to cut, sew, assemble or reproduce the garments.Very disappointing."
5,Wonderful Music,"This was my first purchase of Ladysmith Black Mambazo after hearing they sing with Josh Groban. As an individual CD I found it fantastic and recommend it to anyone interested in honest, clear, uplifting music from a classic African Folk group."
3,Meh,This recording was a little boring to me. Every song seemed similar to every other one. I guess I was spoiled by hearing them with Paul Simon which I thought was a lot better and more interesting.
5,Amazing CD,"I first heard of Ladysmith Black Mambazo when I saw Paul Simon sing ""Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes"" on Saturday Night Live back in the 80's. I had never heard anything like it! Their songs on ""Graceland"" are fantastic!! Most of this CD has their classic a cappella sound which I could listen to all day!"
2,A good product when it came out...,"When it first hit the market, this was one of the best DVD players out there. It had all the options, a great remote, and incredible picture quality. Now, however, it is out of date - ""high tech"" DVDs like _Planet of the Apes_ will make this player go nuts, and sometimes just jam completely. So, while this may be an OK starter DVD, there are cheaper models that are more compatible with the current crop of DVDs. They may not have as many options, but they won't break down when watching ""The next big release,"" either."
4,Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherazade,"This Dover publication is a very cost-effective way to get accustomed with this masterpiece by Rimsky-Korsakov. Scheherazade tells the story of 1001 nights, Rimsky shines his light over a number of this tales. The score is clear, well-readible, but lacks commentary and is not an outstanding reproduction."
2,"The Parthenon, its science forms","I would like to know the cost of this item, and how can I aquire it? I have one of these books. I know that it was published in 1925 through the University Press, NY at 32 waverly Place, New York City,NY. The publisher William Edward Rudge Huntington Nason PHD. It is a hardback book, large in size, and has the original hand drawn science of forms and all its sizes of structure. This book has been in our family for a very long time and I have no idea where it came from. If you have any information about it please let me know.Paula WorthingtonBrenda Salinas1201 East Fishcreek Rd.Grand Prairie, Texas 75052972-262-2452"
3,"many, many words","There are 95 words on the first page. Most pages have between 50-100 words. While it's a nice story, it wears me out to read the whole thing out loud to my 3 1/2 year old daughter.A less complex Little Golden Books story with much fewer words is The Little Red Caboose."
2,Great idea and design but...,"I read the reviews on the LandWare GoType and the Palm keyboards and bought the GoType as a result. I had two issues with it:1) Smaller keyboard was easy to get used to width-wise but the rows are too narrow. I personally found it too hard to not hit the wrong row (hitting the number row when going for the top letter row).2) As reported in other reviews, it wouldn't keep up if you typed too quickly. I'm far from an expert touch typist, but I found myself having to deliberately slow down as I typed. That's fine if you have hours to type something on the plane, but not good if you're trying to keep up during a meeting or something along those lines.Product was very, very solid, but it didn't work out for me. So back it went."
4,a sturdy companion for travel or home,"This little gadget does away with the biggest complaint most folks have with a Palm - you can enter data quickly without Graffiti. I learned the aforementioned curse of data input back on a Newton MessagePad, so I'm very used to it and rarely hit a wrong stroke. But I still love having this as an option for jotting down quick thoughts, whether it's at the table in the breakfast room while listening to support voicemail, or on a ferry to the Outer Banks for a few days off, I have carried and typed lots of data with this little guy, in places that a laptop or the larger fold-out keyboard would not be as easy to use. Sure, the keys are smaller (duh!) and the layout is not exactly the same as a desktop 105-key. And my Corolla is not an SUV! For what it's intended to be, this gadget is tops. As a desktop replacement, well, we'll just have to wait!"
5,An absolute essential accessory for the Palm PDA!,"This simple, easy to use keyboard will increase the functionality of your Palm PDA. Now you can easily type memos, reports, and e-mail messages with much less hassle than Graffiti. Combine this unit with Smart Doc and you have a simple word processor that can even synch with Word on your PC."
3,Wonderfully wacky,"""The Dog ate the part we didn't like."" Southern ghouls and burned out art-rockers collide with hilarious results. Not McGuane's best, but his most imaginative."
2,Playmobil Airport,I would not recommend this. We were very dissapointed with the quality of the puzzle.
3,Work so so!,"I almost broke used oil filter with this when I untightened. Maybe it was my fault because it was the first time to do ""oil change"" by myself. Anyway I successfully loosened the oil filter ."
5,"Sharp AQUOS LC15S5U 15"" LCD TV Review","Top quality, very bright, standard definition picture. Handy carrying handle."
3,Mediocre picture quality for the price.,"I have digital cable and I use this tv in the kitchen. I have not compared this tv quality to a similar size HDTV but as it is, the picture is somewhat grainy if you watch it from about 7 feet away or closer. at 300+ dollars, you might be able to get a better HDTV for a little more money."
4,Gabriel's Latest Sonic Masterpiece,"Drawing on musical themes from the OVO project, Gabriel weaves these OVO themes in a complex tapestry of ethnic flavors to round out his best work since the Passion soundtrack. While the music is all new, familiar Gabriel drones and counter melodies can be heard, but certainly not as noticeable as the Birdy Soundtrack, which builds so heavily on the PG III and IV. Sonically it is one of the finest discs ever to come out of the Real World Studios. As always there is the familiar worldly Gabriel cast of supporting-characters that ground the songs in the native music of Australia. If you like Passion, or are a fan of Gabriel's, this is a must have."
2,Doesn't Stand on its own especially,"This is a great film and Gabriel's music works powerfully in the context of the film. In fact it fits so seamlessly, it is almost a non presence. It is only when the movie ends that it strikes you there was a great soundtrack. Taken away from the images of this incredible story, and it really isn't much. Mostly it is atmospherics and a few out-takes from UP, but nowhere near the achievement of ""Passion"" from the Scorcese film ""Last Temptation"" or even ""Birdy"" for that matter.Not much else to say about it really....."
5,Peter Gabriel is a genius.,This is one of the most haunting soundtracks ever produced. It's much more accessible than Passion. Peter Gabriel has proven his ability to produce some of the finest compositions in our time.
1,as boring as a dead moth,"maybe I'm getting too comfy with my music these days, but this is not only boring, but almost nightmarish in it's repetiveness. A blend of uninteresting ""sounds"", I will shelve this with my wife's Abba CD's! I expected so much more from Gabriel, especially after listening to his participation in the Afro Celt series of recordings. If you are looking for Gabriel as he was, this isn't it. It's just plain boring."
5,Peter Gabriel has scored - literally!,"Peter Gabriel has scored a total of three films during a musical career spanning four decades. That kind of prudence certainly pays off in the mesmerizing sonic landscape of ""Long Walk Home"".The music simply tells the whole story. It paints the landscape of the Australian outback in as vivid colours as the film could ever do, it conveys the torment of the heartbreaking plot - and it does it with the sounds of the continent itself. From Aboriginal chanting to sampled Australian birds to overwhelmingly haunting drum rhythms, this is the stepfather of world music at his finest.I actually found the music first, and got so thrilled by it that it made me want to see the movie."
5,"Directories, Internet sources, and much, much more","Now in its eighth edition, How to Locate Anyone Who Is or Has Ben in the Military, collaboratively written by Lt. Col. Richard S. Johnson and Debra Johnson Knox, is a direct, easy-to-use, ""reader friendly"", how-to-guide packed with tips, tricks, and techniques for finding anyone with an American military connection, whether they are active duty, reserve, or retired. From steps anyone can take to verify claims of a military background, to locating veterans for a reunion, How to Locate Anyone Who Is or Has Ben in the Military is packed with practical, useable information, directories, Internet sources, and much, much more. To put it simply but accurately, How to Locate Anyone Who Is or Has Ben in the Military is an excellent and useful resource."
5,This is a guide to find anyone who has a military connection,"Find people you served with, find friends, fathers, etc. This book guides you step-by-step in locating just about anyone who has any sort of military connection. Now in 7th edition. Foreword by William Westmorelan"
2,Not helpful for everyone,"This is quite complete as a tool for finding service friends, but you must have some vital information (such as Social Security numbers or military ID numbers, etc.) for a search to be successful. It's not enough to know where someone was stationed (an Air Force base, for example) in what years. Maybe that was too much to expect."
3,Military records,"I have not had enough time to thoroughly pursue the recommendations in this book. Additionally, I doubt it will solve my problem which whould have been evident to me in the title. I am not looking for someone, but looking for informtion about someone. I am looking for the troop my father fought with during the war so if anyhone has any informtion to help me with this search I would be grateful."
3,Good Resource but Limited,"I decided to try to contact shipmates from the '60's with whom I served aboard an aircraft carrier. In many cases, all I had was last name and initials. I bought this book hoping it would provide something that didn't come up during on-line searches, but alas, not much new in this book that helped me. It did have a few good tips but by and large missed the mark I was hoping for. It is well written and well organized. Probably more useful for folks in the ""modern"" era i.e. 80's and on."
1,No help for me,"Book is no help unless you have a lot of information on person you are trying to find. I had name, year of birth, where born, branch of service, year of enlistment, etc, and was unable to find if person(s) were deceased or not using info in this book."
4,"Good fun, somewha of a hostel/saw rip off","Not a bad low-budget movie. While a bit derirvative of hostel and saw movies, it still has enough quirks and turns and energy to make it worth seeing."
2,Can't tell the difference,"Personally I don't like the sliding sound from bass wound strings, unfortunately this product doesn't reduce it. To reduce string noise lower the action and lift fingers"
3,Not quite what I was hoping for,"I used to buy a product called ""Doc Farley's String Sudser"" I've never had anything that rejuvenated guitar strings like that. I was hoping this would be similar but it's not as good. It works ok to remove some oils but it doesn't make them like new. Oh well. The other stuff was probably toxic but it sure worked."
1,Loose pieces,"Was loose when received, lense moved around. Vision was not lined up. Not even useable. Disappointing Christmas present. Poorly made."
1,big disappointment,"These binoculars are junk based on 40+ years of experience. They require EXTENSIVE adjustment (at times a 3rd hand would have been nice) to even have a hope of bringing an object into focus. Also, unless you have VERY good light, the resolution is poor. Quite a bummer cuz my kids bought me a pair for my birthday. I tried them for two days on a hunting trip and ended up putting them away and using a reliable 20 year old set of binoculars thereafter. When I contacted Bushnell for a refund, all they would do is give me half credit. Again, the 7x21x40mm model light gathering capacity is very poor as the viewing lens is quite small. Basically they are quite good at taking a far-away image and making it look large and blurry and dark. If you have lots of time to view stationary objects I would deem them barely adequate. Stay away from this model!!!!!"
4,Well-researched and engaging,"I lived in Shanghai as a Chinese-speaking ""expat"" during most of the time Farrer conducted his research. This book accurately captures how the Chinese and westerners I knew talked about themselves and others during this period. He notably gives equal time to voices from the people of Shanghai that most foreigners never get to know, people who aren't represented in the glossy prosperity featured in international news magazines.The academic jargon in the introductory chapter and interspersed throughout is distracting for readers unfamiliar with that literature, but in general Farrer wears his theory lightly, making it easy to understand or skip past.Wei Hui's controversial novel Shanghai Baby should entertain those looking for a fictional treatment of many of the same issues.Journalist Pam Yatsko's book New Shanghai also touches on these issues as well as the larger political, economic, and social trends over the same period."
3,good but missing pages,the condition of the book was pretty good except there were missing lab reports. I luckily had a lab partner with the entire book intact so I could review the labs with her.
1,poor results,i dont know how this product is because i ordered it got charged and i havent recieved it yet it has been over a month now and i have gone thru two classes with out the book so i have a review of it very poorly
5,Conscious Enlightenment,"Transcending Ego: Distinguishing Consciousness from Wisdom is truly the easiest to comprehend and the most illuminating text that I have ever read on the psychology/philosophy of consciousness.Thrangu Rinpoche's commentary is to the point and opens up new ways of understanding Buddhist ideas/concepts that previously I have had a difficult time ""getting my arms around"".Having read about the eight consciousnesses and how these are interrelated and from further understanding the relationship between Consciousness and Wisdom new and profound insights have arisen in my mind. These insights in turn have gone a long way in helping me in my quest for the attainment of Enlightenment.I highly recommend this book for anyone on the Buddhist journey."
3,A universal gypsy sound,"For a Czech-born person this album is a welcome glimpse into the Romany culture of my homeland. My first surprise when I brought the album home was that the lyrics were not in Czech, but in a gypsy dialect. Growing up I only saw gypsy bands on TV singing in Czech. My second surprise was the nature of the music; it did not sound Czech at all, but very latin. The music of Vera Bila and Kale is quite similar to that of the Gypsy Kings, but for me more authentic because of the language and the lyrics expressing very existential situations in everyday gypsy life. The songs have very few lyrics that are constantly repeated, but are haunting in their simplicity of language and message. Of course, what is a gypsy band without the ubiquitous acoustic guitar, a violin, and layered vocals? It's all in there!"
1,One of the worst dreamcast games ever,"This games is one of the worst games yet for the Dreamcast. Is was boring. The Dreamcast has too many racing games. I was hoping is was a game like Cool Boarders, but it was an awful game where you race around on these hoverboards. You can only do a few tricks that are bad in itself. It lacks the depth of GAMEPLAY, that a lot of designers are forgetting to work on these days. Put some effort into these games. All I have to say is that they could've made a better game w/ more moves and deeper gameplay"
4,Secret Codes makes it easier,"A few people don't like the game because its difficult to beat. But if you go to any of the popular game websites, you can get free codes which alow you to win ever race, select every hover board, and every stage.The graphics are great and you get to do a lot of outrageous moves."
2,A Lousy Game,"I've played so many games on the Dreamcast that are worth spending your money on...but not Trickstyle. I agonized to get through this game. The graphics are excellent, but the gamplay is awful and totally unfun. I can't even explain why, but this game just made my stomach turn. It sounded cool, but ended up really anticlimactic."
5,smooth,even though the replay value isnt that great it is pretty difficult to master without codes.I would recomed it to serious gamers
3,Not a buyer,This was the first game I bought. I bought it because I have heard good things about it. But as I soon realised it is not a very good game. I beat the whole game includeing all challanges and japan race #5 in about a week and a half tops. It was fun for that time but the game is not replayable after you have conquered it. I personally like it when you win money for racing not being rewarded with learning a new trick. Also I hate how once you learn the 3 flips and the quiro 360 (or whatever) those are the only tricks you need to know because you can do them both on most ramps and get a lot of points.
5,Best game ever,"Trick Style is a game that puts you in the game. The tracks are awesome and plentiful, with different routes and shortcuts. Another good idea is The Guide he's this guy that kinda shows you the ropes. I've heard some reviews about the track Japan 5, saying it was impossible. Let me tell you it's not. The control that the Dreamcast has is amazing. I'm just glad I didn't have to wait for this one."
1,Lost its apeal after about 5 minutes. Save your cash.,"This game could have been made a lot better. The graphics inthis game is less than par. I do not really have a lot to say about this game. The game play is boring. The moves and tricks are extremely limited. If you want to play a decent game, check out Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. Unless you can find this game at a bargain..... save your money."
1,dont be hipnitized by the graphics,"This game was one that i was expecting to be good.Seeing all the previews at websites made it look awsome.But i realized quik when i bought it it was completely different.Some of the visuals are very well done,but wheres the fun?It seemed like they forgot to put it in.This is a game that is all graphics,no game."
4,This is an awesome game with a few flaws,"This is an amazeing game...once u get used to it is. I have a few gripes about it though, the loading, for a dreamcast game seems 2 take 2 long. Also, the gameplay is hard 2 get used 2, it took me about 3 days 2 get things straight, and im still somewhat confused. But if u put that aside it is a great game and i hihgly recommend it if u can forget about the little things, youll have a lot of fun"
1,"Futuristic Racing it is, Fun its not!","A title such as Trickstyle has great potential but suffers for designers with little vision! When playiing this game you WILL get the feeling that it needs more. You will go away feeling short changed. The graphics are cool but the control is not. this game is basically flat with little replay value, the tracks are TOO SHORT and there is no real element in the game that makes it a worthy purchase.PLAY BEFORE YOU BUY!!!!!!!!"
3,I don't really enjoy this game.,"I have to be honest, maybe I don't like sports games in general. I bought this game because the graphics looked cool and it looks so futuristic. However, once I started to play it is seems kind of bland. The graphics are great but I am not motivated to align my board to some of those rails(which is difficult).This game just doesn't keep my interest. I will stick to action/adventure and RPG's. I prefer unraveling mysteries.I gave it 3 stars because the graphics are really nice to look at. But this game simply isn't for me. You may like it though."
3,Best played with others,"I rented this game back when the Dreamcast came out, and for a launch title, the graphics blew me away. It lacked a bit in gameplay, but flying through the Velodrome was an experience. I tried the single player with cheats, that helped minorly, but it was still lacking. Then, my mom and I played the 2 player, and had A WHOLE LOT OF FUN. If you have the time limit code on, the multiplayer races are a blast, but more should have been put into the single player."
2,Looks different than the picture,"Purchased this for my daughter and it's a lot skinnier than the picture portrays it and the face looks distorted.The bosy is plosh, but the eyes are really hard. I did not give it to my daughter because it was not all plush. Not very ""Elmo"" like."
3,"Almost, but not quite","This is a fine collar. It seems very sturdy. However, the loosest hole is at 18 inches. My puppy's neck measured 16 inches, and it is common practice to add 2 inches to determine the proper size of a buckle collar. I'd hoped he'd have room to grow, but this one JUST fits on the loosest hole.Also, as another reviewer stated, this collar is what I'd call ""carolina blue"" (as in tarheels) or ""sky blue."" I, too, have a male dog, and I have already been made fun of for making him look like a sissy by making him wear this collar. So, I guess it's a good thing he'll grow out of it shortly."
3,Disappointed,"I was expecting another great book in this great series. This one needs an editor and proofreader. Great content, but riddled with errors (typos?) that change the meaning. Some ridiculous errors of fact too (5 1/4 floppies held 100 MB? )"
3,"Good, but could have been much better","If you want to learn the basic to advanced inner workings of a computer, than this book is very good. However, one MAJOR drawback, the illustrations. Some illustrations are drawn superbly: the mouse, keyboard, disks, harddrives, etc. But the internal parts are nothing more than labeled rectangles or squares. ACTUAL photos of a motherboard, pci slots, cmos, video cards, RAM, etc etc should have been taken and included. Read this book, take off the cover of your computer and everything still looks like a strange electronic array. Save your money and tool around the internet."
5,"A GREAT resource for novices AND geeks, alike.","An impressive book in that both the novice as well as computer geeks can gain helpful insight. Each topic is divided into two parts; a broad overview followed by an in-depth explanation. After working with computers for ten years, I wouldn't be able to describe HOW hard drives store and retrieve data let alone a DVD (I can now!) The pictures are clear and concise and the write-ups, informative and logical. The section on the internet alone is worth the price of the book, the bonus is the CD ROM which is a very nice audio/visual presentation."
5,Best book out there for learning the basics of computing,I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to understand how their computer works. The great graphics throughout this book make it worth the money alone. It's so hard to read a book about computers with little or no illustrations to see what is being talked about. You don't have that problem with this book. You can see EVERYTHING that the book is talking about in great detail. The CD is also great and has been updated to include Pentium II systems.
5,A great book for learning computers.,"I just received "" How Computers Work"", Fourth Edition. I wanted to write and let you know how much I am enjoying it and certainly will be a big help for me in my studies as a Computer System Specialist. So easy to understand and it puts everything in a more clear picture on how the working of a computer really operates. The CD was great and really enjoyed how it was presented on each topic. I wish this was one of the main books we are required to have in my course at school. We are studying Networking and your chapters of this subject which was Peer to Peer, Star, and Token are easy to understand and the visual effects really help to understand what a network operations really does. Again, just wanted to let you know how much I am enjoying this book. It will really help me, which it has already in the few hours I been studying it."
3,should assist reader to find more detailed information,"First of all please spell millennium correctly in the headings listing the book .It is a good broad brush introduction to the topic, how does one delve deeper?"
2,I hope the editor went unpaid.,"An interesting and informative if not substantive book. This isn't a complaint, I knew this when I bought it. What I did not know is that it would be so rife with errors. I am on page 52 of the book and have found no less than 5 of them, mostly grammatical.Publishing companies: please, please hire competent editors who have some background in the English language and are also somewhat familiar with the material that is being edited.Here's a real gem, pretty much indicative of the quality of information that is sometimes passed off in the text: ""Microsoft, (upon creating windows), could guarantee that billions of dollars of software and business data already created under DOS wouldn't still be usable.""Think you were looking for ""would"" there, chief.So what parts of this book do I trust as fact and not a typo?"
1,Not for a Beginner,"This book is filled with beautiful illustrations and incomplete explinations. The writer obviously know the material, and was very effective in presenting the information in a completely undigestible manner. In my opinion he should concentrate on trying to teach the information instead of trying to impress the reader with how much he knows...and you DON'T! And how about the type errors...too many to go into. The editor should proof read his work before sending it to press...but then he doesn't really need to because on the 4th page of the book is a disclaimer stating that this book is ""AS IS"" and that they don't take responsibility for the book's accuracy or completeness. I wouldn't want to be responsible for this book either! Well, that's my personal opinion...take it for what you will.Very Disappointed."
1,not for people serious about learning the subject,"I already found several other reviews that already say it, and I agree with them all: that this book is full of nice pretty pictures, but lacks explanation. Its more of a book to entertain, than it is to educate. Additionally, the author really shouldn't be making the predictions he does concerning the future of software, as that is clearly outside his area of study."
1,How this book doesn't,"Hopefully some of the kinks are out of this series of books. I admit I have an earlier version. The index is usually wrong, the information scant and the overall knowledge gained minimal.If you like pictures you'll like this book. If you want to learn something significant - keep looking!The only reason I didn't give it ""0"" stars is because I couldn't choose ""0""!"
4,Great book-easy to read - but fire the editor.,"Que is great for computer books - this book has great pictures and explainations but it looks like the editors were too quick in thier editing and just wanted to get it out - what do I mean? I just got the book and turned to the section on DVD - wanted to understand it better - I found a careless error - it says that DVD holds up to 8.5MB - now I know they ment GB and not MB - but this was just the first section I read - could it be an isolated incident? sure. or could it be a sign of things to come as I read on? I don't know - I hope not...and having bought Que books before - it probably is an isolated incident - but I hold Que to very high standards, as well as you should - I will continue to buy Que books but this is a disappointment...a small one but still.Disappointed."
4,i like it,"it's a good book, especialy for future hackers so young one it is very good you to buy it couse you will learn many things, the book is easy to understand ,even for kids...so just buy it it's not very expensive, but there is a lot of information, a lot..."
4,Great Book - Poor editing.,This is a great book. It has allowed me to fully understand some very complex workings inside my PC. Kudos to Mr white. The editing was poor though. I found a lot of misspellings and poor syntax in some areas that caused me some confusion in understanding the information being conveyed in those particular passages. Whoever edited the draft text needs to work a little harder in their next effort.
4,"A good book, but stretched a bit thin","I thought that this was a pretty good book. The author made it very easy to understand a lot of the basic concepts. This book is targeted for the beginner and I would recommend it to beginners. I thought that the author could have cut a few things out. I was not particularly interested in how Palm Computers work. I also thought that the author could have excluded the part about the Internet. There is a separate book on how the internet works. Overall, I thought that it was a fairly decent book for people who want to have a basic understanding of computers."
3,worth a listen,"Hated this when I first heard it, primarily because the funky bass lines don't appeal to me. However upon subsequent listenings there is some interesting horn work going on here and David Murrays guest appearance is a definite plus. The band seems at ease and carefree improvising with integrity. Low point of album is the destable ""Im Burnin UP(Fire Theme)"" which is a hideous amalgamation of rap and jazz two generes that in my mind don't mix and should never mix. Overall worth a listen."
5,1/2 the fat of Cup o Noodles and fantastic flavor,"I have been subsisting on cup o noodles for the last year or so at work, KNOWING that it was rotten for me. Now I'm not going to claim that the Nong Shim soup is health food, but at 1/2 the fat and a similar amount of sodium for 2x the food, it's very worth while.That said, the FLAVOR is on a whole different level as well. The noodles are tender and the veggies and chicken are actually something to look forward to finding as opposed to sad little dehydrated bits that you hope not to end up on your fork like some other soups.I took a bit of a chance in jumping straight to the 24 pack, but it was a GREAT decision!"
1,Questionable Quality,After promptly receiving the product. I was elated to get to try it out. I do flooring for a living. Within two days the product had cracked in 3 places. One being around one of the wheels. It would no longer roll. Still searching for the satisfaction of a refund.
2,try again and finish the job,"As stated in other reviews, the reproduction quality is not what it should be and could be. Some body needs to start this series over, do it right, and do all 9 seasons, season by season."
3,To pricey,"The Henning family and Paramont need to release all the seasons for those who love this series. It is ridiculous that everything is or has been released to DVD now-a-days, but not this series. You would think that with all the hard work and great comedy in this series, the owners of the copyright would want the actors, directors, managers and staff to be remembered for all their great work. But instead, I am sure someone somewhere is unhappy with the money that will (or will not) be paid to them, so therefore, lets forget about the great comedy and worry about the greed factor."
2,there are but 5 new episodes,"I love watching the BH's and wish all episodes would be on the market.These ""new"" collections are not new, but a few episodes, that have been out there for quite a while. What a disappointment.A pity. I would have loved to have watched new episodes."
1,RIPPED OFF,"First off i did receive the item in a fast and timly manner and i was very pleased with that, but since i had ordered this item the description has been changed when i order the item it stated that this item was a booster box and all i recieve was a single pack of cards. Also the picture of this item shows a booster box containing 10 cards per pack and 12 packs per box. If i had recieved the item i was offered i would have been very happy but due to this trickery i would not recommend ordering for this dealer."
4,"Classic Simak. Yes, There Are Robots.","One day nearly all humans disappear from earth as an experiment by God. The few men who were left behind now live for 5000 or more years without sickness, but the earth has been depleted of its resources. However, without a dependence on technology to hold them back, the humans left behind on earth learn teleportation and telekinesis. Strangely, it's the robots left on earth along with an alien visitor who search for communication with God and the way to secure a soul for themselves. Unexpectedly, a rumor circulates that the humans who disappeared from earth so many years ago are on their way back to earth."
2,I just did not care for it.,Disjointed and too many characters were presented too fast with not chance to figure out who they were and how they fit in.
3,Not for the experienced parent,"I am not disappointed in the book per se, but it surprised me to find that the majority of the suggestions were things that we were already doing. I think that this book would be great for first time moms, teenage moms or dads who don't carry a playlist of nursery rhymes in their iPod. The book does encourage you to use positive and encouraging language with the children which is something that many people benefit from a reminder once in a while (myself included). Borrow it if you can....buy a more advanced book if you think you've already got the basics down."
3,Not as enjoyable as most of Nero Wolfe mysteries,"It does beginning to look like I enjoy his latest mysteries less than the earlier ones (with some exceptions of course). Even Archie's narration here was not as delighful as usual to me - lacked humor IMO and his banter with Wolfe? Meh.Plot unfolded a little awkwardly, but ending annoyed me the most and I really cannot explain why without giving out humongous spoilers."
3,Review for People Looking for Chess Fiction,"The other review is quite thorough - but I will review this book from the theme of chess literature. I am an accomplished chess player and life long devotee to the game. I gave this story three stars because it did flow pretty smooth. The mentionings of chess are okay and accurate. The setting was pretty much a murder that takes place at a chess club and Nero Wolfe and his sidekicks are responsible for solving it. This was my first Stout book, so the colorful characters really did catch my interest and I would read Stout again in the future. However, I had a little bit of a tough time with Stout's style. He uses had had and that that so much and even in the dialogue of the characters. Yuck! Still, from a chess fan point of view and seeing how chess fiction of any type is quite scarce - I do recommend this book even though it is average in quality."
5,LA MAGIA DE LA BELLEZA,"Todas las técnicas que puedes encontrar en este libro para verte más bonita si éstas bonita, y para verte bonita si hay algo que no te gusta de tí...TE LO RECOMIENDO!"
5,Spotted mule,"I was on line just starting to look for a mule. We arebuilding a barn and I will be ready to own my first horse soon on ourlittle one acre of land in Lake County, California. [...]Well, I love the song, and I want that mule. So I told my husband to at least buy me the CD. It's got great lyrics and wonderful folkie acoustic instrumentation. I used to live in Santa Cruz so I can identify with the Highway 17 song. But the Spotted Mule song is my favorite. Is there a spotted mule fan club?[...]"
1,"Too much theory, not enough application","As an electronics packaging engineer, I really get tired of getting the runaround from the heatsink companies and was hoping to find a book that gave me a straight-forward process for physically designing a heatsink. Instead I found myself falling asleep in front of a text that gave me flashbacks to my college years. I realize that theory is valuable, but if it is not put to the test it is worth no more than the paper on which it is written. The amount of practical insight in this book was derived from references and was enough to fit in a thimble. Examples were few and far between and although written like a textbook, there were no problems to work through to cement the theory. Face it John Wiley & Sons, this book should have been named ""Theory of Heatsink Design and Analysis"". The academicians will love it, but for those of us with our feet on the floor and noses to the grindstone...forget this one!"
1,Impractical,"I used this book, along with Mathcad and Excel, for a 1st-pass design.The result was a design that didn't pass the ""sanity check"" (fin dimensions so large as to make them impractical). Note I double-checked my results, retracing the steps thoroughly.For a subsequent design I returned to the methods presented in the book I used for my senior-level heat transfer class (Kays and Crawford, Convective Heat and Mass Transfer), which required much less time and effort.In my opinion: 1) It takes too much time and effort to understand the theory in the book, which is required in order to use the mathematics presented; 2) The book should include practical examples of how to use the technique(s) presented; 3) There should be a thorough presentation of how the technique(s) were validated; 4) This book does not present a practical (real world) method for heat sink design."
1,Adapter,"I was told by XM Radio that I need to purchase this item, and much to my dismay, they misinformed me and now I am stuck with a product that I can not use. It was the wrong item, in which they told me to purchase."
1,FM direct adapter equals great sound,"I originally purchased the adapter for my Roadie 2 (which I returned), but I am now using it with my Xpress. No sound fluctuation at all. It is exactly what I expected."
1,Not for Ford Expeditions,"Well, I thought that this was going to be the answer for getting a decent XM signal, but alas-foiled again. Ford Expeditons(2004 and up...) have a built in antenna in the rear passenger side windwow. The XM transmitter is not powerful enough to send a decent signal all the way back there to a lousy antenna idea. Anyway, I peeked through Crutchfield and used their compatability engine for my vehicle-it said that this item would work w/o and special equipment. I took apart the dash, peeked at the radio antenna input and was surprised(well not really, it is a Ford after all...)to find that Ford uses a proprietary antenna plug. So far, I am unable to find an adapter that will let me use this adapter in my vehicle. Hence, the 1 star. Nice concept...too bad I shelled out $25 bucks for something that doesn't fit my vehicle."
2,"Clean installation, yet no sound quality improvements","The FM direct kit allows a cleaner install by moving the power supply behind the dash, but this could be done without the kit. I didn't have problems finding a clear FM station before, but the sound quality was poor through the FM modulator of the RoadyXT. I assumed (I know) that going direct to the FM input would improve the sound quality, but I was wrong. The sound is just as poor as before. Not worth the $25 in my opinion."
5,The Best! From the BEST!,Alan Troop has done it again. I could not put this book down. I loved it. It was very detailed and fast paced. Alan Troop will surprise you every step of the way! Alan troop has steped up to my 2nd favorite author. You should read the first one too. I think they are both the same as in goodness.
1,Disgusting Yet Boring Dark Fantasy,"Having read a lot of fantasy novels and books with dragons, I like it when an author takes things in new directions. In his attempt to be original, Troop ends up writing something both grotesque and boring.The book is unevenly written. At times it's stiff and formal and at other times it's forid and overblown. The situations are implausible, even given the central idea that there are shapeshifting dragons living amongst us. What I found most difficult is that the main characters, who we're supposed to sympathize with, are people who callously kill and eat people. I made it about 1/4 of the way through this book before I gave up out of a mix of boredom and disgust. Avoid it at all costs."
4,Legends alive in modern times?,The second book in this series is a bit better than the first one. I have enjoyed them both very much and find the dragon Peter to be sympathetic even though he is a killer. He seems noble while monstrous. That is hard to pull off for any writer. This story centers on a kidnapping plot that is first rate. There are family problems just like human beings have yet with a dragon twist. There is betrayal and innovative plot twists. All in all this is a very fun book to read.
4,Bushnell H2O 8x42 Waterproof/Fogproof Binocular,"These little binoculars are great. I bought them to carry during my photography outings in birding season in South Florida and the Everglades. They work just great and are small and come in a very nice case with strap. They are a little on the heavy side though. I'm already carrying an SLR and my lenses, so this does add some weight. Other than that, I highly recommend them."
3,Too Heavy,"They appear to be well made, but too heavy for wear around your neck for any period of time. Item weight listed at 1.7 pounds, which probably should have kept me from ordering them in the first place, but when they came, binoculars actually weighed in at just over 2 pounds. Would probably work well for car or boat use, but doubt few people would want to carry this much weight around on their neck all day."
3,For kids,"If you are an amateur bird watcher, never ever come this way. Professionals don't even think about this as a backup. This is for the kids, who are strong enough to carry this around. Also good for guys who want to watch others in the neighbourhood. The eye-piece focusing is poor. The binocular looks like it is rain-proof. Gives decent quality viewing. All together three stars, earned by the price tag and the image quality. Go for it if you are looking for a cheap, decent binocular."
3,"Binoculars good, neck strap very cheap.",The actual binoculars seem to be good quality. The true test will be this spring when we use them out in the field. The strap is absolutely worthless. The strap broke at the point of the stitching on the first day.
3,Just a note . . .,"The plot's already been nicely summarized for this book, so I'll just add that I was disappointed with two things: first, it is terribly predictable and formulaic. Not a single surprise anywhere. Second, it was a let-down after reading the much-more-enjoyable ""A Hasty Wedding."" In Brashear's book, Blake Fallon (the hero of ""A Hasty Wedding"") comes off as something of a jerk. I guess that is one pitfall of continuities by different authors, though. I was also surprised at just how uninteresting the minor characters were here."
1,Utter junk.,"Don't waste your money on this drivel. Utterly boring, old and really unbelievable bad quality DVD to boot. Fifth generation videotapes look better."
4,"Friends , no matter what happens","This marvelous book, THE FRIENDSHIP TEST by Elizabeth Noble, remindes me of a saying that my Mom used to tell me---""A friend is not a fellow who is taken in by shame, a friend is one who knows your faults and doesn't give a damn."" Noble artfully uses the premise of an old World War II movie about women in a prison camp to characterize her main characters. Noble's characters love each other, commit to each other, forgive each other, and by all means accept each other. Though sometimes jealously rears it's ugly head and then how do friends respond?THE FRIENDSHIP TEST shows us that no matter how you say it---and Noble says it masterfully and uniquely---friendships hold us up in fun, in pain, in failures, in every aspects of life, and sometimes in great book reads. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you will yell at some of the characters, but mostly, you will wish that this book never ends. Elizabeth Noble definitely ""gets it"". I now have a whole new cast of old friends!"
2,Trite characters,"I wanted to read something ""light"" but the characters were too simplistic and lacked depth. The story was predictable and the plot presentaton was choppy. Comparing this book to others where, I believe, friendships were the main theme, this book lacked substance."
2,Self-Absorbed Book,"This book was a selection in my book club. It definitely lacks the content and depth of most of the books we read. I found the characters pathetic, weak and self-absorbed. At some point, people need to realize that they can't blame their parents for everything that they don't like about their lives, and just move on. THis book would be a light read to take to the beach, but I was glad to be done with it. It just went on, and on and on."
3,"It's OK, But Not Recommended","I can't recommend it because I never got into the book - just sort of read straight through to the end for something to do, without being fully engaged in it. The characters are very one-dimensional, with the exception perhaps of Reagan - but we don't get to find out for sure, because she's only covered in a very peripheral way even though she seems the most complex. It is kind of irritating how wonderfully easy everything works out for the protagonist. She sails through all her difficulties with very little trouble, which is unrealistic and not relatable. It isn't a horrible book; it just doesn't provide much for the reader's efforts."
1,"No substance, a terrible book. Don't get this you'd regret it deeply..","I was given this book and I dedicated a whole day reading it to see if there was something memorable about this story, but NO there's nothing good about this awful book. The characters are flat, no depth or character development, the story lacked passion and it has an undefined plot... This is the worst book I have read so far this year.I swear I never throw books away but this time, I tore it apart and threw it away as the worst trash ever.Imagine this 6th rate soap opera, the main character's mother left her and her father behind when she finds out that her husband's real love of his life was her own mother, that would be the main character's grandmother...No taste whatsoever and simply it's impossible to recommend.Don't get this book, you'll just feel cheated with it's trashy story and characters full of voids."
1,Waste of money,"I bought this lamp set for use on my outdoor patio, and would not recommend it to others. Sometimes the lamps' LED lights go on at night, sometimes not. Even when they do go on, the light is so weak and lasts such a short time that it's pretty worthless. I am on the verge of throwing these lamps away, even though I got them just a few months ago."
2,Not so great,"They really don't hold the charge for more than a few hours. After a few months in the sun, the finish started to wear off. It's too bad since it looks nice when you first put them out."
3,So-So,"First of all, if you are considering this movie because of the recent Brendan Coyle/Downton Abbey craze, think again. While Coyle is 3rd billed, and he is good, he only has about 15 minutes of screen time. I was a bit disappointed - as I expected something a bit ""meatier"" in terms of plot - the potential was there, it was just never realized. The scenery is good, but the cast seems to be just humming along, waiting to get things over with. Wait for it to come on TV."
1,Arrived with practically no charge left - no expiration date on packet,"No telling how long these have been around -- usually old batteries are not a problem now that shelf life is so long -- about 10 years is standard, I believe, for lithium batteries. Batteries only begin to fade after you've activated them chemically by putting a draw on them. I needed this for a remote control. I put the battery in and it didn't work at all. To make sure it was the battery's fault and not the unit, I put this battery in my battery tester. The needle went up a tiny bit then faded to nothing. Dead on arrival I'm afraid. What is really surprising and disappointing is that Energizer failed to put an expiration date on the battery packet. If they had, possibly it would not have been shipped and I would have gotten a fresh battery instead."
1,I never thought...,"I never thought I would say that I was ashamed to have read / purchased a book, but here's the first. But I did feel much better after I threw it in the trash, thank goodness it was bought with a gift card. The manner in which Lieven waxes eloquent concerning the ""remarkable"" Chechens, and Shamil Basayev, the terrorist who masterminded the rape and slaughter of school children at Beslan is sickening. It would be similiar to someone of Jewish descent to read a glowing review of Adolph Hitler, or an American to read how Osama Bin Laden's actions are justified based upon our presence in Saudi Arabia. Besides, the prediction of the title shows the author had it all wrong to begin with, and obviously shows how knowledgable he is, or was, on the situation in Russia."
4,Comprehensive but does assume some background,"Undoubtedly a fine work. Comprehensive, Incisive and written with great passion. However it does assume at least a passing aquaintance with the actors, thus for the beginner it would be probably be advantageous to supplement with additional material."
4,Fantastic Folklore,"Diakite's retelling of this African folktale involving Brother Rabbit, Chameleon, a greedy king, a magic gourd and a magic rock is delightfully and originally illustrated with photographs of intricately painted ceramic bowls, platters and tiles that tell the story in detailed and relevant images. Further decorated at the edges with mud cloth patterns, Diakite has provided two pages of additional notes at the end of the book to help clarify the patterns' meanings as well as to give some background to his home of Mali, West Africa and some language translations.While written in traditional picture book format, this book is best read to youngsters for both the joy of oral storytelling traditions which are so important to folk tales as well as because of the potential unfamiliarity of some words and the occasional irregularity of traditional English grammar. Besides, they will not be able to keep their eyes from the illustrations long enough to read a whole page! A fun family read."
3,kidsongs,"The children watched it one or two times and it has not been in the machine again. No near as good as the one on the farm, old mcDonalds, etc..."
2,Diappointed,"My family enjoys the Kidsongs DVDs, but this title my least favorite. It is inaccurate and not as fun as the others. If you want to buy a Kidsongs DVD, purchase Very Silly Songs or Old McDonald's Farm."
3,Not as good as,The songs on this DVD just don't hold my granddaughter's attention/interest like the songs on the Silly Songs DVD do.
5,NEW Jazz,"I disagree. This is new music at it best, mixing the world's great musics in new and inventive ways. I think the lyricist is a nice touch, using a kind of slam poet/freestyle that is really hot. Also, if you list a dancer in your liner notes you know what's up.As for Steve's playing, he and Osby are the new players. Everyone else is just copping Bird, Cannonball, and Trane licks.Ralph Alessi (bad trumpet, BAD), Andy Milne (piano/keyboards), Reggie Washington (bass), Gene Lake (drums), Vijay Iyer (keyboards), Miya Masaoka (koto), Josh Jones (percussion),Ramesh Shotham (Indian percussion), Kokayi (lyricist), Yassir Chadly (vocals, percussion) and Laila (dance)."
1,The dumbest book I've ever read,"Paul Roland claims (on the book jacket) to be an ""investigative journalist""This book is the most uncritical acceptance of stupid things on one volume.Take for instance the chapter on the ""faked moon landings"".He claims ""Prior to Apollo 11 all of Americas manned missions had orbited just a few hundred miles oabove the the Earth""Helooo! hasn't heard about the record attempts in Gemini with agena dockings, hasn't heard about Apollo 8 or 10???He uses the term sceptics to describe those who *doubt* the reality of the Moon Landings"". The rest of this chapter is just as dumb, and obviously *not* investigated at all.I could continue with some of the other whacked out claims, but this one is so obviously poorly researched, you get the general gist of the rest of this poorly researched book."
4,mount this,you need this kit only if your new fan does not come with one.the kit is universal but very nice and easy to use.
5,Home Run,"This is a great product and I cannot find one thing to complain about with Landware. They even have good customer service, as my software download problem was solved in minutes with no waiting. It's tough, light, tiny, and easy to carry around. You can type anywhere regardless of surface, on your knees even. Don't under-estimate the advantage that it has no power supply of its own, so no battery issues. No observable extra battery drain on your Palm V either. This GoType solves the shift key problem I mentioned in my GoType III review, and it improves the keystroke feel so much that it feels like a regular keyboard to me. The key layout is slightly changed and improved too, over the III. The serial port and recharge function mean that the keyboard supplies you with a second synch cradle too (although it does not come with the necessary AC adaptor, which is not available separately as far as I can tell--you have to buy a travel kit or a Palm V/Vx to get one. Go figure.)"
3,WATCH OUT! Palm Freeze!,"I just got my GoType Pro and I was very excited to check it out, but then the scariest thing happened. I installed the software, turned on the GoType on my Palm V, and then it froze! I called their tech support and they told me that I needed to reset my Palm V in order for my Palm V to function again.NOTE: do not activate or press ON before you have placed the Palm in the cradle. This will freeze it up and you can not do anything until you reset. My rating is 3 because of the bug in the software. Other than that it is a pretty cool gadget"
5,Excellent and Useful!,"This product has turned my Palm Vx from a PDA into a laptop replacement. I use it to type notes, write e-mail, and pretty much everything else that requires data entry. The stylus is still necessary for many applications, but I've gotten used to it.As other reviewers have noted, there are a few quirks to work around, but they haven't seemed that serious to me. You get used to them, and the added convenience of the keyboard definitely outweighs the oddities that come from using it."
4,LandWare GoType Pro Keyboard for Palm Vx,"Pros: solid keyboard with no folding -- harder to damage than the Palm rendition.The keyboard is slightly smaller than a normal keyboard so is a little hard to type comfortably for longer entries, but for most Palm entries, it works fine.Cons: It is larger than practical for me for most uses since I got a palm to avoid carrying a laptop/bulky stuff. So while it is nice that is one solid piece, I don't use it as much as I would if it fit in my fanny pack."
1,"Buy The Real Palm Keyboard! , NOT THIS","I got this piece of crap, and its horrible, I immediatly returned it for the real palm keyboard, hey more expensive things, are usually better!"
2,Oh dear,"I saw this when It first aired on Discovery. The program is trying so hard to be like Walking with Dinosaurs but it totally fails.The main problem is there is just not enough footage and so many shots are shown repeatedly. While some of the footage is indeed interesting there are only so many shots of hairdryers thawing out a lump of hairy ice that I can take, and while them finding the first mammoth tusk was interesting by the time they had dug up the 50th I was almost asleep...There is also a problem with the CG. It is just terrible!! Whereas in walking with dinosaur you really felt that the dinosaurs were alive, in this the mammoths look horrible and dont walk relistically. The program looks like it was rushed so that it could jump aboard the Walking with Dinosaurs bandwagon.I'd recommend trying to catch a repeat on Discovery before buying this disc"
2,Buy Walking with Prehistoric Beasts,This is good for watch on television once in a while. But if you want a good film about mammoths watch Walking with Prehistoric Beasts. It has just as many mammoth shots as Land of the Mammoth but are much more realistic. Not to mention all the great other creatures beasts describes. Land of the Mammoth had bad special effects. It should have talked more about cloning the creature itstead of digging in the ground and repeating the same shots over and over again. They were diging in the block but the film stops before they got to the interesting part of the block. Now it is good for hard core mammoth fans but I suggest Walking with Prehistoric Beasts.
5,10 star little gem of a booklet,"Being a chicken owner for decades and owning a number of books on chickens I think this book has everything you need to know. From the 12 tips for a successful coop design, space requirements, temperature control, which on hot summer days or freezing winter nights is a must know. Choosing the right flooring for both cleaning and rodent proofing, types of bedding, nests and nest boxes, feeders and watering set ups, fencing and other helpful information. Makes me wonder if the others who gave such negative reviews even read this small booklet."
2,cheap but not worth the money,This is a cheap book but isn't worth the money. The Storey book on chickens is much more useful.
3,short version of another book,This book is informative and great if you are only wanting a little info. The Storley's guide to raising chickens is the more complete manual this is the cliff notes version of that book.
2,Not worth it for me,"Useful information but if you have or are planning on purchasing Story's Guide to Raising Chickens, don't waste your money. The information in this bulletin is pulled directly from the book."
2,Waisted my money,The information is good but it was the same stuff found in Damerow's other book about raising chickens. If you just want ideas for building a pen this will help. But if you already have her other book then you already have this info as well. Thanks for your time.
2,disappointed in the amount of info,i was expecting to get more than the book offered as far as didderent types anbd plans for coops...some useful info though
1,A BIG RIP OFF!!!!!,I should of read the reviews! To begin with it took 3 weeks to get this book straight from Amazon.This book is no more then a way over priced little 5X8 pamphlet.I don't think I will be purchaseing anything from Amazon in the future.Barbara Guilmette
1,Not a good book,This is not a good book at all. The information in this book can be found for free on line. I would not buy this book if you are looking for information or building plans for a coop.
5,Great pamphlet,"I have several books on this subject, but this little pamphlet beats them all. It's precise and to the point. I loved it."
1,Save your money,This booklet is not much more than a pamplet. I was expecting a book on plans for building a Chicken Coop. There are no plans what-so-ever. It is just a general information booklet. You can obtain this and more on the Internet. It is a waste of money. I give it 0 stars.
2,"Basically a pamphlet, not a book.","I ordered this because we have a book called ""Storey's Basic Country Skills: A Practical Guide To Self Reliance "". I thought it would give us detailed information on how to build a chicken coop. Like actual detailed designs, with exact material lists and step by step instructions on building different coops (blue prints). Unfortunately was written for people who already have excellent carpentry skills and can design a chicken coop on their own, incorporating the items listed in this pamphlet/bulletin. Does offer some good common sense info, just not enough in a 32 page bulletin, for a novice wanting to build a chicken coop."
2,Redundent companion,"Building Chicken Coops; Storey Country Wisdom Bulletin A-224 is a redundent companion when purchased with Storey's Guide to Raising Chickens. The information is identical. If you need plans or instructions for building a coop, look elsewhere. However, if you are looking for things to consider when building a coop and don't need any more information this is the best book. Otherwise, save yourself some money and just buy Storey's Guide to Raising Chickens also written by Gail Damerow."
3,Same info in guide to raising chickens.,Wasted 3 bucks on this book would have been nice if description said it had same information as the book on raising. Chickens.
4,Chicken coop,"I originally bought this thinking I would get a plan for a chicken coop but instead got info on how to design a coop and why it should be that way. Rate high for the clear, concise language."
1,"Ordered a book, received a phamplet","I was disappointed - I did not expect anything fancy, but next time I will double-check the number of pages when I order a book - this was more like a phamplet you would get from the local farm advisor. I ordered another book at the same time, for the same price, and it was great - a BOOK!"
2,Be aware that these are sweatshirt scraps!,"If you are ok with sweatshirt scraps cut into jagged and odd shapes, go for it! To me they seem like a bunch of fabric that was swept up at the end of the day at a sweatshirt factory. They were all clean and pristinely white, but it just wasn't what I was expecting."
3,When did you leave Sweden,"I must admit I was pretty disappointed, having read the ""raving reviews"" here and previously heard her earlier albums in Swedish. This album is a bit overrated and a bit like a conservative nightclub dinner music, no matter that it is sung and played perfectly. I miss the originality and freshness of her earlier Swedish work. O.T. New York"
4,Great CD,"... It is wonderful. slow, sad and sexy. I've given to several people as a gift. I think you will like it."
2,Disappointing.,"I purchased this CD upon the recommendation of a male friend, a musician, and was very disappointed upon listening to it. There's nothing new here, nor done very well. I'm afraid that my friend was taken in by a beautiful face, because her jazz talent is certainly lacking. I'd send it back for a refund if I could."
4,"Too little Lisa, but a smooth jazz CD","Fans of Lisa Ekdahl probably know her for her folksy style in Swedish (and I recommend anything she's done in Swedish wholeheartedly). This first English-language product is missing some of the key elements that attract listeners to her Swedish-language stuff, e.g. her excellent pitch flourishes and light accoustic guitar accompaniment, but this album is a stand-alone work anyway. Jazzier and less folksy in style, Lisa shows off her musical breadth here a bit."
3,The standards on the album deserve stronger delivery,"I don't know anything about Lisa Ekdahl's singing except what this recording reveals. Apparently, Ms. Ekdahl is a pop singer and has decided to come up with an album with soul. However, most of the standards included here deserve depth and stronger delivery (Lush Life sounds really impotent in execution, for example). This CD, yes, might signify ""a jazzy new direction for the artist"" as the liner notes go, but it is certainly not ""the Best of Contemporary Female Jazz Vocal"" as some reviewers argue."
4,Entrancing,"OK so I was seduced by her voice, but this is a beautiful album. It's not quite as strong as her other English-language CD, ""Back to Earth"" IMO, but it is nonetheless excellent...she's still expressive and sultry, and the backing trio is very very solid. If you want some background music while you read on Sunday morning in your flannel pjs, or while you decorate the Christmas tree, this is it. ""Cry Me a River"", ""Lush Life"", ""Blame it on My Youth"", and the title track are standouts. If I can't marry her, can I at least get her to make another CD with the Nordahl Trio? Please??"
4,Excellent Binoculars in a small package,"I bought these because they were the cheapest pair of compact bushnells I could find at the local department store. Waterproof is a bonus although I have no need for it yet.In response to the reviewer saying the lenses are not clear; these lenses are QUITE clear, much clearer than the 10 dollar competition. The difference is night and day, and is why I bought the bushnell name.For 40 dollars you can't go wrong. Not terribly useful during darker periods but that is to be expected with compact lenses."
4,Early Thoughts on New Binocs Purchase,"Bought the Bushnell H20 10 x 25 roof prism binoculars as a gift for my husband. On initial usage, they seem like they will be great. Nice size for portability. Time will tell if they are truly waterproof and fogproof or not. I wanted these to replace our current ones, which are not fogproof/waterproof and fog on the inside of the lens - which you can't clear by wiping. I have already noticed, however, that the new Bushnell H20 does fog on the outside of the lens. The eyecups fit tight to the eye, which seems like it would be a good thing. Not sure if I can adjust for this by playing with placement on my eyes - again, time will tell. We live in Florida, where it can be really humid. If the issue continues, then I wouldn't recommend for summer usage. Need to play with themn some more, so we'll see!"
3,Binocular Un - Flex,The strap is useful. The binoculars come with a case that is to small. The binoculars don't stretch open enough so that the eye pieces can more comfortably rest on the eyes. The designer must not have taken into account that men have larger faces and eye spacing. Otherwise the binoculars are good.
1,H2O Binoculars,"Very poor lenses. I have $12 binoculars that have better optical quality. Also, the diopter keeps loosing its setting. I would love to have my money back."
1,Cheap junk - Avoid,"I purchased these as a gift, and thought I should just check them before wrapping. I'm glad I did. The focus wheel had a heap of play in it, they were almost impossible to focus. One side was noticeably softer than the other in focus and couldn't be adjusted out using the diopter. Bushnell may have made quality gear in the past, but it's junk now. I can't believe these sell for $150 in some countries."
3,Not as good as the OZ books,"It was interesting to read a non-OZ book by L. Frank Baum and some of the characters also appeared marginally in some of the OZ books. But I didn't feel the book hung together like the OZ books. It was almost like there were three stories in one, rather than one story which drove to an ending. As such, I didn't enjoy it as much. I'll have to read it to some children and see how they enjoy it."
2,Dull,The characters are very uninteresting and the story is dull and longwinded. I guess the appeal is imagining for yourself what it would be like to have a magical cloak or to laugh at what happens when people get their wishes granted. I thought the book was flat.
4,Satisfied with purchase of used HP printer on Amazon,"I was very satisfied with the purchase of a used HP printer through Amazon. I arrived safely, it was well packed and now I have been using it for two weeks."
3,"Fair Printer, Expensive Ink","The printer prints fine.However, on a Mac with OS 10.5 there are no options for different print qualities, a major shortcoming if you want to save ink by printing in fast or draft mode.DO NOT USE COMPATIBLE INK CARTRIDGES. Non-HP cartridges are a waste of money. They clog and stop being useful after a very short time, long before their ink is used up. Use only HP brand cartridges."
1,Don't Buy!!!!!,"If I could have I would have given this product no stars. Here is why. My 9 year old received this toy for an early Christmas present. We thought they were fine. He had played with them for quit a while (10-15 min.)then asked his Aunt what the guys were doing. She told him to ask me and what did I see. Two stick figures one grabbing the other ones privite area. Hans was the instigator no matter who we hooked him up with. Once it happed it happed more often. In my house this is unacceptable. The toy is rated 8+ why is it okay for an 8 year old to be exposed to this behavior, let alone in a toy. We called the company, and told them of this action. They were not suprised, they said that this ""qurky"" action (sexual content) is in all of them. I highly recommend you to not buy this toy. Unless you think it is okay for children to be exposed to sexual content at the age for 8."
2,"Good idea, but not so good results.","The toy is fun the first 3 days, after that it just keeps doing the same thing over and over. If you buy 4 or 6 it gets better but after a few days you'll get bored again. It's a good idea, but I guess they will have to add some more functions and interactions whit the user. The games are really bored, but some animations are really funny."
4,xmas order,These cubes are good entertainamnet for short duration 10 minutes most and keeps the child's attention. Recommend yo buy 2 different sets to keep the child entertain with 4 stck figures. Amusing idea and the price is reasonable.
2,Cute but not worth the money,"I totally agree that this toy is cute but not going to hold your kids' attention for long. Kind of like Tamagotchi, except more expensive and less entertaining. It was the toy to get last Christmas, but I don't see anyone playing with it anymore. One of the many cubes that we have does not work on one side of the cube (the person can only go to 3 of the 4 sides). A good toy to bring to a restaurant when you want your kids to stay in their seats before the food comes."
3,Not impressed,"Apart from the 9th book, this was definately one of the worst books in the series. Book 7 was terrific but this book was just annoying. Firstly, The whole good-evil thing is just getting irritating. I am glad Morgan and Hunter ""finally"" got back together again, but I thought that Morgan wanting to kill Hunter when she was a wolf was possibly the worst storyline yet. I love Killian he is v. cool, Ciaran also has alot of class and Eoife was also a really great character, I wish she'd stayed through book 9 instead of Erin. At one part in the book, Hunter mentioned to Morgan how he also had ""struggles"" between good and evil but I would have been more convinced if he'd given an example. I think that this series is overall very good, but it lacks alot of balance, everything is so dark, there's never any light."
3,Neither Great nor Funny,"Probably would best serve entry level speakers. Quick reference for simple needs. The kind of stuff ""Inro to Speech"" in college was made of. Sparce, very sparce, on the humorous side and lacking citations for many quotations. I'll keep it on the shelf but it won't be the first place I look for quotes or quips."
3,Just Okay,"While this book does have plenty of quotes and sayings to choose from, the organization doesn't make a lot of sense. When you're quickly looking for a motivational quote, you end up referencing several different sections to find what you're looking for. Don't get me wrong, it's fine and has plenty of content but it's just not intuitive to use."
5,"Funny, Practical, & Witty","Great to keep around for a quick smile, and hundreds of topics that are easy to find and reference."
3,Not that interesting,"There seem to be a few good quotes sprinkled around, but a lot of them are unremarkable, cliche, or hackneyed humor."
3,"Very introductory, still not to bad.","Michael's is probably now best well known for his behemoth work on John in the NICNT, but this short (only 265 pages, on revelation?), commentary on Revelation is worth a read and having on the shelf. I would recommend it to more lay people than scholars, as I am partial to David Aune's very scholarly 3 volume set in the Word series. Michaels gives just intro material here and I think one would need something more to supplement (Aune). However, IVP publishing is a great publisher, so it can be trusted. Overall, 3 out of 5 stars."
4,Revelation Revealed,"Michael's commentary deciphers the challenging text of The Book of Revelation. His work is not exhaustive, nor should it be given the purpose of the IVP Commentary Series. His comments elucidate the difficult without confusing the reader. Scriptural continuity is maintained while conservative textual elaboration is affirmed.We use this commentary for a small men's group discussion. When stumped or for simple clarification, we refer to Revelation by J. Ramsey Michaels."
3,IVP on rev,Normally i use IVP commentaries a lot in teaching but this one is a little short on links in OT to Opinions in Rev. For teaching purposes i did not find this book worth it's use./
4,warm trance,"""Scorchio"" is a simple, uplifting trance track with a crisp, fast beat. Layers of synths, bass, and percussion harmonize pleasantly over the course of its nine and a half minutes. I like the intro, which reminds me of Basic Channel's ""radiance iii"". The song's positive vibe conjures summertime imagery such as driving, jogging, or hang gliding alongside a beach. Listen closely and you can hear exotic percussion and what sounds like simulated seagulls deep in the music.I would have liked more remixes. Besides a radio edit, there is only Emerson's Late Nite Dub, a conservative reprise with a nice outro. As it stands, this CD is fairly good but not spectacular."
5,Stellar,Gotta have this one - gave it a spin last night at my gig to normally jaded crowd that loved it. Hopefully Sasha and Emerson will kick out more together...
4,"Excellent, not quite as good as Xpander though","The long awaited follow up to the great 'Xpander' see's Sasha collaborate with Darren Emerson. It's progressive trance/house as per usual but with a latin theme to appeal to the Ibizan scene. As always you have to be patient since the full length version is nearly ten minutes long. The upbeat latin style builds into a classy cut although it does'nt quite match Xpander.The Late Nite Dub is dubbier but not as hard as you might have expected but nonetheless it's harder than the original and quite Underworld-ish, no shock there then. If you like the epic cuts then you'll want definately want this!!"
5,Great knife!,I bought the vegetable cleaver for my wife for Christmas. She loves it! She finds it easy to use and easier to use than other knives.
5,very nice vetetable cleaver,i have used this cleaver for one month and love it. it is a nice cleaver for cooking asian food. nice size and weight!
2,"good knife, bad seller!","Got the knife as a Christmas gift from friend. The knife itself is very sharp and perfect to handle. BUT!! the blade has been damaged partially when it arrived. The knife was in a hard plastic box and another beautiful box outside because my friend asked a gift package. So i think the shipping was fine. But, the seller! How could you put a damaged knife into the box?!Anyway, I've already used this knife, because most part of the blade is still ok, and my friend wanted to see me use it. of cause i did not let him see the damage."
5,Purchase Satisfaction,"This is my first experience in purchasing goods through Amazon. Every aspect of the purchase has been most satisfactorily handled by Amazon. I was kept advised as to the progress of my order; the C/D arrived within the indicated time frame; the goods were properly packaged and arrived in perfect order; and I am thrilled with the music contents of the C/D ""Very Berry"" by the Berry Lipman Orchestra (I had ordered the C/D specifically for one item that I had heard on local radio).In the future I would not hesitate to deal with Amazon."
2,Blind Taste Test,"I came in with the idea that the Beam Sauce was the best. In a blind taste test, including this Makers Mark sauce, all 6 of us picked the same winner...............it was.....................The Jack Daniels!"
5,Yum,"I bought this for my bf since he loves Maker's Mark. He loved this sauce too, although the bottle is kind of small. We marinated chicken in it and also used it to dip steak in. It has a great flavor. I need to buy more!"
5,wonderful range of music and lovely voice,"You never know what your buying when you purchase an unknown artist, but I was very surprised that I would like the cd so much. I would reccommend it to anyone who is looking for sophisticated and intelligent entertainment."
2,This is 'trying to hard',"I really feel for Deborah. I know she means well, and here voice is tolerable, it's just that it all sounds a little too forced. The songs are all very similar and sound alike a 'disney afternoon'. I believe her next album could really make a 'sound' if she would 'try' less and just let the songs come to her.p.s. I do believe that the song 'Lies of Handsome Men' has some good potential, if the melody was stronger (louder)...."
2,"Nice size,but not what I expected","I purchased this and was pleased with the size and cooking capacity, but was extremely disappointed to discover that it was made in China. This was unexpected due to Royal Doulton standards and the price of the roaster. Also this piece is NOT white, as described. It is actually off white, almost bisque. If you have other pieces by this line then you can store them inside of this piece which I thought was clever and well thought out."
1,Wasn't much of a story at all.,"I must disagree with nearly all of the other comments.The plot device used in this book to get Lauren to have to spy on Nick is thinner than anything I've ever seen. Both of them are SO unprofessional.How did Lauren stay a virgin up to this point in her life if it takes so little for her to sleep with Nick? I think his reaction was probably rational if a little cold.There were so many moments in this book that resembled other little moments in JM's other books. She cannot write a totally new, original book. And she also takes up a good chunk of space in every book recounting the entire love affair during The Separation. There's always a Separation in every story of hers."
3,Could've been so much better!,"My rating is really 3 1/2 stars...Great beginning. I was hooked on the story upon reading the first page. It went straight into the heart of things. On the negative side, I felt that Ms. McNaught was so rushed to finish this story that she left a few things unclear and unfinished. The story begins with a suspicion of a business spy and it was never really solved. Then there was the story of Jim and Ericka that in my opinion had a lot of potential for being a wonderful subplot but was not given the time and space to flourish. I'd love for Ms. McNaught to think about it and perhaps reconsider redoing the ending just like she did with Whitney My Love when she added the Stephen Westmoreland subplot that culminated with her story Until You."
5,Double Your Pleasure!,"Judith McNaught shows the reader how to double their reading pleasure by giving them double the hours of reading entertainment with this her newest novel, ""Double Standards."""
1,zero stars actually,"I love Judith McNaught. HOWEVER, I don't like this book she wrote because of all the reasons that the other one star reviewers mentioned. Nick did treat Lauren like crap. How can any woman fall in love with a jerk like Nick? From the very first time he was mentioned, I just thought that he was a jerk! Please read another Judith McNaught book instead of this one."
1,Hero is an #$#@,"This book was well written, but I couldn't really enjoy it because the hero was such a jerk the whole book. He treats the heroine like crap. Seduces her and tries to force her to continue their affair when she starts working for him even though he makes it clear he will NEVER marry her and that is all they have. Then, at the end of the book, he accuses her of something she doesn't do. Completely degrades and humiliates her as does everyone else who knows her and should know she wouldn't do what she is accused of. Then, when he finds out she's innocent, he goes to her and she instantly forgives him. This book makes me sick. I feel it is an insult to women that the heroine allows the hero to treat her that way and then just instantly forgives him. I would have had much more respect for her if she had made him suffer for the way he treated her but she doesn't. She just lets him treat her like crap and comes back begging for more."
5,FANTASTIC!,"WHEN I READ THIS I FELT IN LOVE WITH BOTH CHARACTERS AS ALWAYS WITH ALL HER BOOKS. I AM ONE OF HER #1 FAN. I DON'T READ HER BOOKS ONCE OR TWICE BUT I AM ALWAYS READING MS. MCNAUGHT'S BOOK. THE ONLY THING THAT BOTHER ME I WISH SHE COULD WRITE MORE OFTEN BUT I UNDERSTAND. I FELT THAT FROM ""REMEMBER WHEN"" TO ""NIGHT WHISPER"" WAS AN ETERNITY BUT IT WAS WORTH WAITING FOR. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!YOUR #1 FAN ALWAYS"
3,Hated the ending!,"I was so mad when Nick chooses not to trust Lauren! That just ruined the book for me, Otherwise it was good, but I wouldn't recommend it, there wasn't enough time with them ""together again"" to repent for the Ugliness Nick showed."
5,An outstanding modern day Romance....,"This book is a real page turner, absolutely one of the best. The characters are true-to-life especially Nick! You'll surely fall in love with him because of the way Judith McNaught describes him, the ultimate dream man! The story is truly extrodiary because who knows it can happen to you! :)"
3,"An Okay Read, 2.5 stars...","2.5 stars. This turned out to be an okay read after all. It started really slow for me, but definitely picked up in the middle. I loved the heroine. She was an innocent, but she didn't make the arrogant hero walk all over her. He got more than he bargained for with her. I was cracking up at some of the things she said to the hero when he peed her off. It was great to see him get put in his place for once! The ending was driven by a big misunderstanding which I hate, so it took away from a higher rating, but all in all, this was an okay HP-ish dated contemporary."
2,Uck.,"I've read many of Judith McNaught's novels, and this is probably my least favorite so far. I am not so much a fan of the contemporary romances in the first place, but I am always willing to read a J.M. book, contemporary or not, but this book was a waste of time. Aside from the fact that I was able to finish the entire thing in a matter of a few hours on a lazy afternoon, I felt that it wasn't quite up to par with her usual character development, and was just kind of... cheesy. I guess if you want a really quick read with some cheap thrills, this one's for you."
4,Loved it,I thought this was a great book. I couldn't put it down. Judith McNaught is a fabulous writer.
3,Not one of her best novels,"This is a below average Judith McNaught novel, however, her worst efforts are better than most other romance novelists better efforts.I just didn't buy in to the reason why it was soooooooo very @#!@ difficult for the hero and the heroine to tell each other the truth.She is a bit of a doormat, and he is a flaming personality disorder- a match made in Axis II heaven."
2,Very poor Judith McNaught,"Judith McNaught is my favourite romance author. Her books are generally witty, hilarious at points and always have good character development and a story line. Unfortunately Double Standards does not live up to that. If I wanted to read Mills and Boon I would buy that. Where do you hear that the heroine falls into bed with the hero within 2 days of meeting him. Then by the time to book carries on with the story it is half finished. I could not identify with either the hero or heroine in the novel and very little character development took place.I enjoyed all Ms McNaughts historical romances and Perfect and Paradise. I would give the historical romances a 5 out of 5 rating and Perfect and Paradise a 4.5 out of 5 rating. All to be recommended, but I will not buy any more of her books in the near future. I will have to wait until they get to my local library - then I won't feel like I have wasted my money when I don't bother to finish the book."
5,enchanting book,"This book was one of my favorite's by Judith. She can make the reader fall in love with the hero (usually a very attractive, strong male) and envy the damsel in distress (some innocent sexy female). I always enjoy leaving my life for a trip to Judith's world."
5,Nick and Lauren are wonderful,Handsome and Successful and charming Nick Sinclair is. Lauren is a clever but vulnerable female. I loved how she played hard to get with nick until he finally fell to her feet. Great PLOT!
3,Jerk Gets the Girl,"Speaking strictly from the romantic aspect of this book ~ it wasn't believable. The plot was a good one, but the lack of character development destroyed any and all hopes for a compelling story.Nick Sinclair was a bastard, plain and simple. He was the modern-day rake but without the charm and charisma to make up for it. Nick's attitude was aloof and that was a turn-off to the reader. Lauren was a naive young woman who fell in love too easily with the first man to seduce her.Unfortunately, even though there is a happily-ever-after ending, the reader is still left feeling rather ho-hum."
5,A great book,"Judith McNaught is my favorite writer. The first book I read was Once and Always, I didnt think there was a book that could top that but with this book it did. I just felt as though through this book I could put myself in their places. I would recomend this book to anyone"
1,sony dvd/vcr,the first week i had to send product back to mfg. it is not user friendly the instruction booklet is not designed for the ordinary person. i do not recommend this product. i am orry i bought it
2,Echo Chamber,"We bought this model for the ease of dubbing VHS tapes to DVD. Dubbing was very intuitive. Despite some other reviews that said the color was washed-out, we didn't have any problems with color issues. However, the audio function was terrible. While playing DVDs (which is most of the mileage we would put on the machine) the audio sounded hollow and tinny -- like an echo chamber. Neither my wife or I are audiophiles -- this just sounded bad. We tweaked every setting, and triple-checked all the connections, but nothing helped. Finally, we just hooked our old player back up and the sound was fine. Ultimately, we returned the unit."
1,Product returned,"I have never been disappointed in a Sony product until trying the RDRVX515 DVD/VCR recorder. I currently own and use two other Sony DVD recorders. The RDRVX515 is totally inferior to the other two. The signal and recording quality are frankly not acceptable - the definition is just not there. Also, when I tried to record a movie on several of the cable premium channels, it recorded for a few seconds and then stopped and a message came up saying that ""you cannot record copy protected movies"". This makes the recorder totally useless to me."
2,Very Disappointed too,"All my electronics are Sony, so I was expecting great things. My primary reason purchasing this DVD Recorder was to transfer all my VHS tapes to DVD. But, as the other reviewer noted, I have experienced quite a few problems. The disc freezes during Finalization when you are done recording a VHS Tape to DVD and you have to unplug the unit to reset it (not a big deal if the plug is accessible). I have wasted too many DVD's having to re-record them. Sometimes the original VHS tape is better quality than the DVD copy. I returned my first one and was refunded my first purchase and sent another one. I am now having to send the second one back to due to sound issue with it. Sony is no help at all, they don't want to admit there is a problem. I am having my 3rd one sent today and if the problems persist, I am done with this Sony product! Wish me luck."
5,Great little gizmo!,Great little gizmo.! Great sound and picture quality. Good price and fast delivery! Thanks!I would recomend this company and product to anyone that needs a good VCR-DVD combo!
1,Run...don't walk away from this horrible product! (Sony RDR-VX515),"Bought this video cassette/DVD recorder because it was a Sony. BIG mistake! What a total piece of junk. Sony should be ashamed of duping their customers like this. The VCR recording quality is terrible: murky and the sound is tinny and muted. The DVD recording manuel would take a NASA scientist to understand and then, when you finally do figure out the instructions and follow them to the letter, sometimes the DVD recorder records, and other times gets locked into the ""Loading"" function and simply won't read or record a DVD at all. The timer for DVD recordings is unreliable and as stated before, sometimes it records and others it does not. As others have stated, the dubbing function from VHS to DVD does not result in clear DVDs and sometimes won't work at all. I would give this product ZERO stars if I could. Do not buy this product!"
1,Horrible!,"We returned this after one week. It doesn't even deserve one star. The VHS image is awful. The recordings were awful.It takes about a century to finalize a recorded DVD.The manual is hard to decipher.Sometimes it froze up for another century and responded to no commands, and gave no indication of why.For some reason it's being pushed like crazy in every electronics story and I'm sure most of them will be returned."
1,"Never thought I'd say this about a Sony product, but ...","Run -- don't walk -- away from this product.First one -- VCR playback horrid, DTS channel busted.Second one -- lasted one day -- red component video died.I've had Sony products for 30+ years and NEVER had a problem with them, other than they eventually died of old age.I eventually went with the Panasonic DMR-ES25S -- no VCR (but you could hook one up) -- MUCH clearer picture, better TV tuner for recording.Sad day when I pick a Panasonic product over a Sony, but if Sony drops the ball like this and Panasonic picks it up ..."
2,"Nice features, but several issues make it a lemon!","The Sony RDRVX515 DVD Recorder has lots of nice features and would be well worth the price if it worked as advertised. Unfortunately I kept it too long trying to get the DVD recorder to function properly and was not able to return it to Amazon. Out of 12+ tries dubbing home VHS movies, only one DVD disk completed without errors, despite trying three different brands of DVD disks, including Sony. The DVD drive refuses to eject disks for up to 30 minutes, which gets REAL frustrating. It scratches factory movie DVDs. The thick manual does not help. Finally sent it back to Sony and still waiting for it, but after reading the other reviews with the same type of problems, it sounds like I bought my first Sony lemon. For the record, we love our other Sony products, especially the laptop and camera. I suggest passing on this DVD recorder until they upgrade the model!"
2,Sony just has to be different!,"The machine does not have an s-video input in the back so you can only record TV programs through the RCA video input. The biggest problem is it has a block not to record ""copy-righted"" programs. In other words, when you try to record a movie or a program that contains a copy-right signal, the machine detects it and blocks it from being recorded. That means if you would like to record a movie on HBO or SHO for your own viewing, you cannot do it. So you decide if this is a good choice for you! At least not for me."
2,DVD part won't eject !,"I had this for about 6 weeks, working well, till started causing problems. It won't eject the disk from the dvd. Initially it worked by itself after 2-4 hrs. For the second time I sent to the service centre in Laredo, Texas. I had to pay 38 dollars for UPS shipping. They cleaned & sent back in 7-10 days. The same defect happened in less than 24 hrs. They sent me a shipping label, took 14 days to repair again & sent back to me. Now I have sent it back for the 3rd time & awaiting action. For the last 2 months, I had been connecting, packing & shipping , then doing the same thing again & again. The sony service centre is not very helpful or responsible, I have made numerous phone calls on this & wasted a lot of time . Also, the sound video in the front won't work. I won't recommend this product at all in the present format. It needs upgrading, rectifying the major defects."
1,"Poor design, failed drive.","The DVD drive on my unit failed within three months. It was always a pain to use anyway. Sony telephone cutomer service was annoying in the lengthy extent of questioning to determine if it really failed or was it my disks. The customer service rep. seemed very reluctant to offer warranty service. I had to pay for shipping to Laredo Texas for repair of their failed product. One happy customer tell someone, but an unhappy customer tells many."
4,WOW! So many time saving recipes...,"This book is a real time saver for my family in the kitchen! It is full of wonderful recipes that require little or no supervision using the crock pot. It is so nice to be able to add ingredients to your slow cooker in the morning, go about your everyday business, and have dinner waiting for you when you get home! I highly recommend this book to busy mothers and career women alike! It is a true gem to have in your kitchen."
5,Perfect,"I live in a trailer(don't hate) and bought this about 7 months ago. I put a 40"" samsung on it, and it works/looks awesome. Great construction, easy to put together, and looks fantastic when I dust once a quarter. Note this is not made for big rooms, my 40"" sits on this like a glove, so would look awkward with a 42+"". holla"
3,Dreaming of You,"Lilly Lujan is one of the top supermodels in her field. She is staying at her agent's getting a vacation. She looks out to the magnificent gardens and sees the most breathtaking thing there-- Enrique the gardener. She decides to introduce herself. Enrique Pacais knows that he should not talk to Senor Molinaro's guests, but she has approached him. So he is polite and friendly, but not overly so. He has worked hard to find a good job so that he can send money home to his mother and sisters in Mexico. Lilly continues to meet him in the gardens, and soon she's asking to help him with the gardening. As he works with her, he discovers that her beauty is more than skin-deep. The story line was a bit predictable though and was a drawback. The characters were vivid and extremely likable."
3,Stains already,"This flatware is supposed to be dishwasher safe and tarnish resistant, but it's starting to show stains already after only a month of use. I never had this problem with my cheap flatware set that I used for 14 years."
3,Satisfactory Display Piece,"Forces of Valor products seem to vary in quality and features, and the P40B is on the lower end of the scale. The props do not rotate freely, and the landing gear is fixed. It is also more fragile than other Forces of Valor 1/72 WWII aircraft models, and I've already had to superglue the prop hub and one of the horizontal stabilizers back into place. For the price, it is not bad, but I wouldn't expect much of it other than to sit on a shelf."
4,A needed standard,This is a standard read for anyone interested in the Nordic Path. This translation is easier to understand than some. I highly recc it!
3,A good translation,This edition includes a good translation and a lot of useful context information. The family tress are especially helpful.
5,"Great Reference, Great Condition","As a reader, I love to collect books - especially those classics that most people haven't even heard of. Norse Mythology is one of my favorite subjects. I tend to like to read from the source. It's why I choose Latin in High School, and am working on Japanese now. The Prose Edda is an interesting book that I've had for *years*. It is a good reference for writers looking to barrow characters from classic tales that aren't over-used, and its also a good source to view for comparisons between Tolkin's world and the view of the Scandinavians from ancient times. A good read - definitely something you should keep in your bookshelf."
5,Excellent book,This book was incredible. Snorri manages to construe every story with such eloquence and subtle humor is amazing.
5,An excellent source of Norse myths and stories.,"""The Prose Edda"" by Snorri Sturluson was an informative read from the beginning to the very end. Many of the stories in the book paraphrase texts from ""The Poetic Edda"", which makes it a lot easier for one to look up the important citations from that work. Although all of the stories were a joy to read, my favorite story in the book would have to be ""Kvasir and the Mead of Poetry."" The very idea that anyone who drinks from the mead of poetry could be an inspired poet or scholar is fascinating, and relative to my own qualities as a person. All in all the book was a great read, and if any one desires to know anything about the Norse Gods and Goddesses, and their myths, then this book is a must have."
5,polar express,i have allways loved this move ans now i have it on kindle so i can watch it anytime at all
1,not able to view 3D,"The 3D is not viewable. I tried it over and over. I put in other 3D movies to see if something was wrong with my tv and they worked fine. The 3D on Polar Express had lots of red around the heads and greens around the mouth. Just couldn't get it to adjust where you didn't see double and halo's. I tried it with the glasses that came with my TV and also the cheap 3D glasses that came with the DVD, nothing worked. I would not recommend this product. You get what you pay for."
5,Once Again I Was Pleased :),"It's been my goal to try all of the flavors of these toaster pastries. The Brown Sugar Maple was another tasty one. I might like this one the best because of it's richer flavor. As far as the fruit flavors go, I'd say the Strawberry is the best, followed closely by the Apple, and Cherry Pomegranate.The only two flavors I haven't tried yet are the Blueberry and the Chocolate. I'm sure the Blueberry will be just as good as the other fruit flavors. The chocolate I'm not so sure about.Remember, whichever one you do choose, always go for the frosted versions."
1,you will be disappointed,I was looking for a good book on printing and when I seen this book I thought it would be a great book. when I received it I was totally disappointed and was kind of aggravated because the publisher didn't put any kind of description on amazon and now I can see why. The book was printed in the very late 1800's or early 1900's. today's photographer would want nothing to do with this book because it has nothing to do with today's photography. I returned the book and put my money toward a different books. Take my word dont waste your money or time.Joe D
2,I was disappointed,"The actual face of the cards it very cluttered and makes it very difficult to play. My bridge group made it through only one hand. What a shame, because they are quite pretty."
3,"great on engines, not enough on carburaters","This is an execellent book if all you want to do is understand the principles of how the engine works and some general problem solving. In my experience with model engines, it is most common that the carburetter needs adjustment and that is where this book is really lacking."
3,"Lovely Artwork Suitable for Framing - a review of ""Mockingbird""","This is a charming book that features a reworking of the old ""Hush Little Baby Don't You Cry..."" song. In this version, the entire family works to keep baby happy. And why not. It is baby's birthday.Three Stars. [C+]. This is a lovely book with sweet charming artwork. Turn of the century appeal and much warmth. The story is charming as well and my children like it."
5,Part of Our Bedtime Routine,"My 2-year-old loves books about babies and this is one of our favorites. We sing it every night as part of her bedtime routine. The book is beautifully illustrated and each page offers lots of opportunities to point out objects to help build vocabulary. This is a ""must-have"" for every baby's library"
5,"Why isn't this currently in print, I can't understand.","This is a masterful and insightful interpretation of the Symphony No. 5. Maybe because it doesn't have the exaggerated flash of the overwrought Bernstein interpretations (I think Lenny was trying TOO HARD), it's currently out of print after being available in several different stereo LP, cassette and CD incarnations over the years. Or perhaps the powers that be in Russia aren't interested in finding another Western partner to reissue it?Whichever...it's a shame. Maxim Shostakovich plays it as music, not as a programme, and the symphony is stronger for it. With the USSR Symphony, he even outdoes his later London Symphony recording, though that one is a close second. Alas, it's out of print, too."
5,A Nightmare with Open Eyes,"Peter Redpath is not only one of the greatest historians of philosophy today but, unlike the vast majority of philosophers, refreshingly honest in the most profound sense: intellectually. This fact makes his *Cartesian Nightmare* of virtually unparalleled value for students and scholars. Anyone who wants to understand the postmodern pathologies of our culture will benefit immensely from the book!"
2,its useful but not quite,"sounds really good.. but there isnt much u can do it with it, the memory is just wayyyyyyyy too low for anything really.. its hard to change wallpapers or etc.. not something i would buy ever again, waste of money really, specially since theres like ipod touch worth less.. do wayyyyyyyyyy i mean way more than a pda.."
2,Not easy to clean up,"I had bought this brand in a different bottle before, but have been unable to locate it again. Thought this was the same but it does not clean up as well as the prior purchased one."
2,"My fault for buying this, can't get into this type of game","I like drivng games and shooting games, but I like to have variety for when friends/family come to visit. My attention is not cpatured with this game and I get frustrated easily because I get stuck!! No one whose tried it can get passed the Mummies in the grave yard. Anyone whose played this game will know that this is VERY early on in the game.I hate it as a game because I don't do well when playing it."
5,The Best Resident Evil Yet!!!!!!!,"I am the biggest RE fan I bought the first RE years ago after someone who works in Wal-Mart said the game was really cool! After I played it I was like I want more and sure enough they just keep comming! When I heard that the dreamcast was going to have Resident Evil: Code Veronica I just had to go buy the dreamcast so that I could play this game! The graphics are the best in the RE series. Awsome weapons, Great Monsters, Its a must have!"
5,SUPER GREAT GAME,"Ok I had his game when I was younger, I since have sold my dreamcast to stay with the times, I just seen the resident evil movie and I wondered what system I had that game for, and then I found it DREAMCAST (boy that brought back memories), well anyways I had to buy the system all over again just to buy this game. but make sure that you are up for the challenge, I had to buy the walk thru guide with this game because sometimes it does get difficult all in all...BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Excellent Game,"Code Veronica is a good addition to the Resident Evil saga. Here's the breakdown:Graphics-8/10- Compared to todays' games, the graphics are about average. Then again, the game is (almost) 5 years old. But it has rich 3D enviroments, and good definition in characters.Sound-7/10- The music gives you the scary feeling you would expect from an RE game. The only bad thing is the voice acting. It aint horrible, just not what you expected. It's better than previous games.Gameplay/Story developement-10/10- The gameplay itself is excellent. But, unlike the Dreamcast version of RE2, there is no custom controls. That would have made the gameplay better. The story continues directly from RE2 (RE3 did little to develop the Resident Evil Plot) and brings the fight to umbrella. To find out what happens to the characters, play the game.Overall, the game's a hit. The Dreamcast version is the best, but if you don't have one, get it for PS2 or Gamecube."
5,the best Resident Evil yet,"I admit it... I bought a sega dreamcast for only one game. Resident Evil:Code Veronica is that game. I knew I would like the game, I've loved and played all the resident evils currently out.The story is the best yet... I really felt a connection with all the characters, the pacing is perfect, and just when you think it could be over, you are reminded there's still a disc left to play.Sega's Dreamcast truly shows off its processing power with this game, surpassing all the resident evils on sony's playstation. But then again, I'm comparing a 128 bit system with a five year old 32 bit system. Still, if you have a dreamcast and need to buy only one game, this is the one.The controls will get some getting used to, especially if you've never played a resident evil game before. But once you get it down, it's pretty easy.Play it in the dark, in surround sound, and prepare to be scared and entertained. Zombies and mutant freaks will be on your mind for some time."
5,Resident Evil Code: Veronica,"Simply the scariest game I've ever played in my life! The great graphics in this game help to get you into the spooky atmosphere this game has. Great soun effects, great character design. I waited to be alone at home at night every time I wanted to continue playing this game, you will always go on this game expecting a surprise that'll make you jump out of your chair. This is a must buy for any Dreamcast owner, if you are tired of the series at least you gotta give this one a try, I found out that is so different especially in the graphics department. The fully polygonal backgrounds are so sweet and they look better than the pre-redered backrounds of the other RE games. BUY IT AND PLAY ALONE AT NIGHT, IT FEELS EVEN SCARIER THAN ANY MOVIE!"
4,Claire's controls stink,"This is by far the best game that DC has to offer however, the difficulty in getting Claire to move where you want her to go is unbelievable. Surely with all of the time spent making the awesome graphics and storyline Capcom could have made the player movement interface work better."
3,"Good, but not great",Okay I'll admit it when i first got RECV I loved it. I was hooked. Then I got far into the game yadda yadda yaddda. And then. BOOM boredom. Sure it has amazing visuals and great sound and control. But it didnt catch my attention for a long enoough period. Even though it is a great game to own.
2,Corny...!,"Now before I start talking about how bad this game is, I would first like to state out the few positive things about this game. .The graphics in this game are truly stunning, and it certainly creates a truly scary atmosphere, but, unfortunately, that's about it on the positive side.This game is an absolute mess. The controls are horrible, and the puzzles make this game a tad too difficult without a stategy guide. Now for what I really wrote this review about, the game's story. It's like a jolly awful b-movie. The voice acting is atrocious, and the story is about as believable as Pat Buchanen becoming president (brrrr!). Believe me, it is extremely corny! The people who made this game could have done alot than this! Rent the game if you wish, but please don't buy it! When it's all said and done it's a complete waste of time, and a rip-off!"
3,Disappointing,"Although there has been a lot of good comments about this game, I found myself very disappointed. I have played all of the other RE games and this one has a very different feel to it. The fear factor doesn't exist as the genre of RE:CV is more of a shooter than a survival/horror game. The graphics were truly stunning however, and there were excellent cinematic scenes. I like the RE series because it has been very gory, but this game cut out ALL headshots and legshots. That means that you will no longer see the gore of past classic RE games. Although I personnally was disappointed, I'm sure many people will enjoy this game greatly. Give it a rental before you dish out your dough."
2,Not Scary,"I cannot begin to express my disappointment with RE:CV. I bought a Dreamcast specifically for this title, and when I began to play it my stomach sunk. First off ALL THE GORE IS GONE, when I first heard this I thought it wouldn't make a difference, but all in all it totally ruins the ""Horror"" theme of the game. Lets hope their is a code to open it up. The voice acting is still lame, but the story is pretty good, definately better than RE3. The graphics are stunning, the intro is borderline breathe taking. Unfortuantely a lot of fog has found it's way into the Resident Evil universe due to this upgrade. I'd have to say rent this first and see if you enjoy it. I can see hardcore finds loving it."
5,Good game? The answer... BOO-YAH!,"The Resident Evil series has been a major player in the video game world, and has risen the gaming bar again and again, with the fourth installment of the game, expectations were high, and the game soars above them. You will be thrilled. Get this now."
5,Code Veronica does not Dissapoint!,"Having bought a dreamcast at release, I was anxiously awaiting the release of this game. Now, I read some of the reviews here with 3 stars, and they talk about blood lacking. What? The blood is here, in all its classic, red spattered glory. Just as much as any other resident evil title. The story develops well, and the voice acting seems to improve with every resident evil game. The graphics are flawless, and none of the pixelation that seemed to plague the playstation versions is anywhere in sight. The cinematics are GORGEOUS, and rival those of FF8. Capcom has done well with their first horror survival title on dreamcast. This makes me look foward to shemnue even more."
5,Reminds me of Peggy Lee,Reminds me of a modern Peggy Lee. Lovely tunes and silky voice. Happy to hear this album again and again.
5,"GET IT STRAIGHT, MR. EDITOR...","When you are presenting background data on jazz albums.Peggy Lee was NOT married to Dave ""Balfour,"" but to thatwonderful ex-Four Freshmen baritone, DAVE BARBOUR!I give this album 5 stars on the strength of other outingsof Ms. Molaskey that I've had the pleasure of hearing.(Mr. Horiuchi, however gets the minimal 1 starfor obvious reasons.)"
4,great exhaust system,"This is a great exhaust system. Contrary to what the description says, it fit my 2003 SR5 4WD V6 perfectly. I believe it also stated that this is a side exit system but it is not. It exits in the same manner as the stock exhaust. Overall, this system is very easy to install, adds a nice sound (not too loud at all), and slightly increases throttle response and gas mileage. Very pleased with this unit."
5,You'll never regret this purchase!,"Mix up some mojito's, set out some tapas, invite all your friends over to play canasta, and let this play! I originally bought this in 1997 for my then boyfriend. But we broke up before I could give it to him. Thank goodness we did. I love it, my kids love it, even my cat! No kidding! When the cat hears Chiquito playing, he comes running! This is one album your collection NEEDS! Word has that Dee Dee and Her Panchos: ""Pancho"" was actually co-written by David Bowie for a Euro TV show!Don't forget to hunt down another CD called ""Crazy Cocktail Party""."
2,What Cream Suspenders,The supplier did not have these in stock and was not able to say when they would be able to get them. The supplier quickly refunded the payment.
5,gordon ramsay's cookware,Beautiful product and extremely well-packed. I always rest assured that anything I order from Amazon will arrive intact and whole. You all are superb!
5,Sony DVD recorder,I have read all the pros and cons that everyone wrote about this product and I have to say I have yet to see a down side. This product is amazing. If you follow the manual and you do your research this product will not disappoint you. I have had this product for 2 months now and everything I have tried to do has come out with amazing results. I would get nothing else. This is a hit machine.
5,Sony RDR-HX715,I'm extremely happy with this RDR-HX715. Its a big improvement over my Sonry RDR-GX300. The main reason I got it was for its dual-layer recording. I can get 3 hours 37 min. on a +R DL disc in the SP mode. Nice overall unit!
2,Homegrown Book,"This little book could have used an editor. There are many errors that would not be caught with a spell checker (""...after further thought it makes since."" ""By its self..."" ""...each cinder block unit t the beginning..."" ""a generous wheel barrel...""). ""To"" is often used for ""too."" Sentences are garbled (""I keep my garden as simple as possible by running some of the vegetables up on trellises saves a lot of space."" ""...what kind if fertilizer to put on the garden.""). The book's friendly attitude may overcome its obviously amateurish home production. There are difficulties with its content. It contains undocumented hearsay and very little that has not already been written about in more substantial books. Many ideas are untested guesses. The one tidbit of fresh insight was the author's comments on color clues as a key to watering. For a rank beginner who has not read much about gardening, this book may be helpful--even inspiring. Anyone else is advised to stand clear."
1,Rip Off,"I don't know what criteria they used to price this book, but they must have been high on something when they did. This book is NOT worth $126 by any stretch of the imagination...unless it's gold leafed and a collector's item! I would have liked to purchase this book, but the price is prohibitive. So, for the few people who think this book is worth the price, good for you. As for the author, you might want to rethink this: is it worth it to have a few idiots pay the outrageous price of $126 or is it better to have hundreds pay $8-15 for the book which is a reasonable price for such a book? I'll just get the info I need from a free Google search, thank you. Talk about rip-off and nerve! Disgusting and shame on you!"
3,disappointed more in myself than the book,"I heard about this book and all the raves about it on another gardening sight and rushed to buy this, didn't realize I was paying 50.00 for a paperback book...totally my fault for not reading description. Hopefully I will learn enough about all this and be able to sell some veggies and recoup my loss."
3,Don't Trust it!,"I have read mixed reviews on this Gunvault, but I decided to give it a try. Mine works awesome, if it works at all. Seems like one out of every ten attempts the door doesn't release. It will sound like the latch disengages, but the door fails to open. I wouldn't trust this thing in an emergency situation."
4,"Flawed, but best available.","Flaw: The upper shelf has a very slippery surface, not foam-lined like the rest of the interior, even though the box says the entire interior is foam-lined. This means your gear will slide all the way to the back of the safe if you bump it at all while trying to grab it quickly. Will have to glue some non-slip material to the shelf. Maybe a thin mouse pad (upside-down) or similar.Flaw: the interior lamp is on top, where it only lights up the top shelf (and poorly at that). The bottom shelf is a black hole.Wins: It's pretty easy to program, opens super fast, and lets you turn the button-beeps on/off at your preference. The batteries seem to last pretty well. I access mine at least twice weekly for trips to the range, and it's going on four months with no issues.Overall: it's not perfect, but I don't think there's a better alternative on the market."
2,Failed immediately,"Upon speaking with two gun shop owners plus a good friend who owned a Gunvault for years and receiving strong endorsements from them, I decided to purchase it despite a number of poor reviews on Amazon and elsewhere. The unit is roomy and has interesting features (i.e. comes with an A/C adapter for power back up purposes). The unit worked fine at first, then 19 hrs. later failed to release the latch (correct code input, hear a whir sound, but the door does not release). The exact problem many reviews mentioned presented itself in my unit < 24 hrs. after purchase.This type of product needs to be RELIABLE! Amazon was great about the return, and I purchased a DAC Sportsafe from an Amazon vendor. The Sportsafe felt higher quality out of the box, and I will write a review of it in the future."
5,Quick access to handgun while keeping safe from kids,I have had this item for a couple weeks. Setup was pretty simple. I really needed somewhere to keep a loaded handgun with very quick access but could limit a child's ability to get a hold of it. If you have small children around your house I highly recommend this safe. Each night before I go to bed I enter the punch code to access the handgun for practice. It did take a few tries to get used to but I am confident I could get it openned in the event of an emergency.
1,Went up in smoke after 3 weeks.,"Worked fine with just the batteries installed, but went up in smoke after plugging in the supplied adapter. The keypad no longer works to open the vault. Piece of trash IMO. I will never purchase another gunvault item again."
1,door jammed,Door kept jamming and would not open.The door would only open with the key.The light bulb inside was loose and kept falling.I returned it.
3,Good heavy steel and high tech.,Have only ownded the vault for a short time. Have had some trouble in getting the door to open each time the code is inputted. Sometimes it take two or three tries to get the door to open
4,Was nervous for some of the negative reviews,"So far I haven't experienced any of the other problems listed. I opened this thing a couple hundred times, in the dark, etc and it works as advertised. Only problems I had were foam lining from top and exposed roof is pealing and the shelf is flimsy at best. I'm using it without the shelf, so not a huge concern...."
5,Works great! Exactly what I was looking for,"This safe works very well. The buttons push nicely but do not give sensory feedback.I bought this safe as a secondary storage device for a few handguns and found it to be very spacious. I was able to fit three full size handguns, a subcompact, a flashlight, 1 magazine for each weapon, and 150 rounds of ammo. This took a little finagling but still allowed for easy access to one leaded weapon.On average it takes about 3 seconds to open the safe. The motion sensor and tamper detection work well.As secondary or bedroom safe (or if you only have a few weapons) I would recommend this. After reading reviews I was very hesitant to buy this or any other safe as opinions seemed quite mixed. I am very pleased, the description of the product as given by gunvault is very accurate."
4,Won't work right unless you use Duracell batteries,"I own two of these units that were purchased about two years apart. The second unit never worked quite right. The door would often not open on the first unlock. I thought the locking mechanism needed to be oiled or something.However a close inspection of the instruction manual says not to use any other batteries except eight (8) AA Duracell's. Once I switched from Energizers to Duracell's my second unit is now working flawlessly.If anyone is having trouble with their unit, the first thing you should check is the batteries!"
2,Unreliable,While I like the idea of this gun safe I found that its very unreliable when trying to open it without the key. Sometimes it works and sometimes it does not. Also the punchouts to connect a cable are welded in there very well. So well in fact you cannot punch them out.
2,Piece Of Crap Gun Vault,"This gun vault does lock but it takes several tries to open it. If I was in a hurry to get to my weapon, I would be dead. It takes the code every time..it clicks.. but does not open until you put in the code twice...or maybe three times. I have found that if you gently close it, it will open on the first try the next time but if you slap it closed it takes two or three tries to open. Also, it isnt as easy to attach the cable to it. The instructions say ""Just punch out the pre defined holes""...well guess again...I bent the hell outta the thing before I got my drill out and drilled out the ""just punch out"" holes. I haven't tried the batteries yet but I bet the battery holder was designed by the purple dinosaur. Not real happy with this, but it will keep the kids safe."
2,Defective vault,"I ordered this vault on Amazon. It arrived in reasonable time, but did not work as per operator manual. Called customer service at the manufacturer that said this was defective and was sending me a new one. Currently waiting to receive the new vault."
3,"adequate, but could be better","Unit will open properly approximately 50% of the time, after i applied some lubricant to the latch assembly, the unit now opens properly approximatley 75% of the time. Wouldn't want to bet my life on it opening, but it meets my needs for child safe storage only."
1,Don't bet your life on it.,"Quick access safes are ideal for bedside 'just-in-case' home defense. They give you fast access to a self-defense firearm without having to get your keys or spin a lengthy combination lock.However, I can no longer recommend any GunVault for such use.The internals of the finger pad unlock mechanism wear out. This prevents the safe from opening without a key. The keypad accepts the code, you hear the motor turn, but the door does not open, even with brand new batteries.Hope it doesn't break when you need it most.I'm replacing mine with something from a different company."
5,Great for the price,Setting up the personal combonation was a breeze. Despite the small size two guns fit comfortably in it. I had concerns upon buying if it would be too heavy to put on a closet shelf but it has been on the shelf now for two months no problems. There are more expensive safes out there but the Gunvault is perfect for my needs of keeping my guns locked up and out of site.
4,I like it,"I can store a .44 magnum, 9mm, and .22 pistol all at the same time. I wish the response time for opening the door was faster. I haven't tried any torture tests, though I've heard other professionals have and have proven it to open after a drop."
5,sweet,"Awesome bedside safe for my husband's handguns. It has room for other small things you want to lock up. It requires 1 9V battery for backup power, it also has a power cord to plug in. Opens by 4 digit finger code or by key."
1,Poor Reliability,This product worked well for 14 months--it was covered by a 12 month warranty. At that time the lock release for the keypad quit working. The company offered to replace the unit for $80. For the price of this unit I expected it to last much longer. The original batteries have lasted longer than the safe.
5,The bad reviews are both right and worng,"If the safe has a weak battery or and is not plugged in it does not work well. see bad reviews, they are telling you what happens if this safe is using low batteries. Keep it pluged in and put a new namebrand battery in it and this is and great safe. I almost returned it and would have put a bad review. PLUG IT IN!"
2,same issue with push buttons,"I have the smaller older model with the 4 button pad, i love it. This version the buttons don;t register and I always have to enter code more than once. i don't like that this one needs a plug either. My other version (one gun/4 finger) has never had a problem(same company) I actualy have less gun grab room in the 2 shelf model as the shelf is in the way, and the shelf is not padded which makes it noisy to draw a gun from. I'm not trying to bash the product, but i have the one gun model and it is perfect...no draw noise, no plug in, easier draw size."
1,DON'T BUY IT......or take it back like I did,"Honestly, this is the worst game I have played yet for the Sega DC. If you are looking for a football game for the DC definitly buy NFL2K rather thank QB Club 2000. As soon as I started the game I have never been so dissapointed in my life. What is most amazing to me is the fact that QB Club 99 for the 64 was better than 2000 for the DC. If the Dreamcast is the system of the future QB Club needs to definitly make a better game. Compared to NFL2k this game is horrible. Every aspect of NFL2k is better, gameplay, graphics, and fun. If your looking for a football game this christmas, don't buy Qb Club 2000, at least for the Dreamcast..."
1,This game is not very good.,"This game really did bite it hard on N64, but improved on Dreamcast only by a little bit. The only good thing about this game is the graphics.(I reccomend that you don't buy this game.)"
1,BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD,"Indeed, this game looks like it was put together by a bunch of first graders. Every function of the game-gameplay, sound, graphics-are laughable. Anyone in their right mind would take this godforsaken joke of a game back within hours after their purchase. Thus garbage makes some old 8-bit NES game look magnificent by comparison; this will make you wonder if Acclaim Sports is just trying to get some laughs out of it."
1,Buy something else instead,"This game is hard to control and awfully limited for a Dreamcast game. This game is terrible. The graphics are decent, but the graphics are jerky and confusing!"
1,"Horrible, THE WORST DREAMCAST GAME YET",See Jack Buy-See Jack Play-See Jack cry Ok first i gave it a one because there was nothing lower. This game tried to challenge NFL 2K and didn't even get as good as Super Nes Football. Before this game i never thought a football game could stink so much. Linemen running as fast as Deion Sanders. I rented it and returned it 5 minutes later. FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR JOY DON'T BUY THIS GAME OR ACCEPT IT AS A GIFT!
3,QB Club Needs WORK,Graphics are great but trying to catch the football is a big enough challenge to make a grown man cry. NFL 2K IS HEAD AND SHOULDERS ABOVE THIS GAME. Skip this one and purchase NFL 2K
1,Worst then Genesis football,"This game was so undeserving of any rating. It is so bad, special rating systems need to be put in for games that deserve a rating that goes below 0. Control is lackluster and awkward, the frame rate drops way below what the Dreamcast can handle, and the gameplay is above par (which is bad). It looks like 1st graders created this title. Acclaim did a horrible job putting this together. It is NOT worth a first look. If you want a licsensed NFL game, heavily consider NFL2K, which is well better than this garbage. Definetly neck and neck with Soul Fighter as Worst Dreamcast game."
2,Stick with NFL2K,"I got this game from my ex-girlriend for christmas. I thought she was a sweetheart for buying me a video game then I found out why it came from an ex. This game is great to look at , but the controls are horrible. If you are a football fan and want to play something realistic and fun this game is not what you are looking for. My roomate bought NFL2K and after playing that I can say without a doubt that's the better choice to make. QB club 2000 just has too many little things that eventually start to drive you crazy and frustrate the heck out of you. Passing is ridiculous, running is way too easy too easy to break tackles and score off of, and the AI is very poor. Skip this one."
5,El Poder de la Intencion,"Excelente publicacion de la obra de Dr. Dyer.Su contenido desarrolla nuestro ser interior, conectandonos aun mas con nuestro Padre, Creador y Señor de todo lo que existe.Nos estimula a continuar en la busqueda de la plenitud como seres humanos y como seres trascendentes."
5,really good,"Colm Wilkinson really has a fantastic voice. Really warm, powerful and moving. ONe of the great voices of all time. A great voice for theatre. His singing is truly wonderful and moving. The song selection on this cd is great and well worth getting for any musical theatre fan."
5,THIS IS MY SECOND COPY. WORE OUT THE FIRST!,"COLM WILKINSON IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST. HIS VALJEAN PART IN LES MISERABLLES WAS MY FIRST INTRODUCTION TO THIS DYNAMIC VOICE. I AM AN OPERA BUFF SO IT TAKES A LOT TO MOVE ME. HE DOES.IN THIS PRODUCTION, HE PRESENTS ARIAS FROM A NUMBER OF HIT MUSICALS, CHOOSING THE BEST AND IT IS JUST WONDERFUL. I ACTUALLY WORE OUT MY FIRST COPY AND WAS DELIGHTED TO FIND ANOTHER ALTHOUGH IT TOOK FOREVER TO ARRIVE. IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT."
1,Jean Valjean arrives in 1997!,This is no good at all. All the songs sound like Jean Valjean singing them. That's the only role he can do and only because he originated it.The phantom numbers are weak.Enough said!
3,Highpoint of Iranian Revolution,"This is a great novel about a crucial moment in the 1979 Iranian Revolution. It chrocicles the friendship of three women in the days immediately after the Fall of the Shah and the ascendency of the counter-revolution (i.e. Khomeini's Islamic Republic). It also documents the tremendous activities of women in challenging the oppressive edicts of the new government. At a moment when Iran is going through a renewed period of openings, this novel shows some of the true heritage of the Iranian Revolution that needs to be built on. Wonder why no one has ever developed this book into a play or a movie? Get it!!!"
3,50% fit with 2005 Honda Accord Coup,"The product looks cheap, unlike the pictures show. It does not fit in my 2005 Honda Accord Coup beside the shift handle, or it fits awkwardly. I then hook it up with the lighter in the box/seat arm and it fits better but still awkwardly. It is not on automatically when starting up, and tuning up may take some effort, especially in the squeezed seat arm box. Signal was better in country areas, but have noise in every channel when I drive to Cherry Hill, NJ which is 10 miles from Philly. I would not buy it if I knew all these, but feel it is OK to use. By the way, the shipping from Satechi is fast, except the box was not sealed.After less than one month of using it, it broke. I contacted Satechi, who was very helpful, and sent me a label for shipping it back. I actually ordered another FM transmitter from them. I would still recommend them"
3,Good Product While It Still Worked,"Product works great, seller shipped the product very quickly! Only gave it a 4 out of 5 because I feel it could be improved in a few areas.UPDATE***9/13/2010This product has completely quit working for me. The display wont show the channel and I have tried every channel just to see if it is transmitting and it is not working at all! Very dissapointed as I would like to listen to my iPhone/iPod."
5,Nice well made product,"I almost bought a 2nd one for my lady's car, I liked it so much. Solid and attractive, it's available with an extension for an even roomier fit. But it is the customer service that gives the unit an 'A.' I had a problem that turned out to be my lighter, but they had sent a replacement before I could figure out that it wasn't the unit! Excellent company."
4,this ROCKS compared to the other similar products at almost half the price,"The first one I got worked ok for a couple of days then it started to pause my I-pod touch randomly I sent the company an e-mail and they replaced it! its replacement has been fine it works as well as any fm transmitter can you have to pick a good clear channel and it does have cd quality sound. if you are not patient enough to pick a good clear channel the a transmitter is not for you. I digress the remote is very handy it lets you keep your eyes on the road while surfing songs. I even ran a gps off of it while using the i-pod very handy the only thing i wish was different is I hope different extentions become available for it because it does hide behind the shifter in my VW. great product, excellent customer service and a funny name!"
2,"works good for iPod, not iPhone","after about a year with this product, i can give it only 2 out of 5.it is good, charger and remote works.but, i can barely use it with my iphone, since the radio interference is twice as loud as the music. only while using airplane mode - it is good (but no phone calls or SMS). with my iPod it's much better.one more thing, because of the low quality plastic. the screw that holds the connection to the power plug in the car - broke after 2 months. i had to improvise with my own screw. too bad.I wouldn't reccomend this product, not for 40$ anyway."
5,Great Product!,When i first got this is didn't fit in my 99 civic so Satechi sent me the extension arm for free. This thing works great! It started off with some static but it quickly ended after a few days. The trick is to turn the ipod volume almost all the way up and then adjust your car volume to whatever you want. It takes a little bit of time to find a good station but once you get one you are good to go. My friends have seen this in my car and now they all want one too. And the customer service people at Satechi were really friendly when i contacted them about the extension arm.
4,Don't buy the 5 in 1.....,"It's not a bad product (6 in 1). I used to unplug it from the car every time I was done using it, bad move. The plastic connector wasn't really engineered to withstand that much use, so I decided to replace the unit. I went with the cheaper model thinking that I didn't need all of the extras offered on the 6 in 1. What I came to find out is that the 5 in 1 doesn't have the ability to ""fine-tune"" AND it doesn't send as strong as a signal to the radio as the 6 in 1. The 5 in 1 was absolute rubbish. I live in a metropolitan area and there was almost NO time that I didn't have interference of some sort. Now, I'm back to the 6 in 1 (leaving it plugged in all the time, just turning it off). It's signal is much better (not perfect, but much better, and able to fine tune). Most of the time you don't even remember that your not listening to CD's. So yeah...it's good."
2,Didn't last!,"I purchased 2 of these last year for Christmas and within 6 months they were both broken. The fuse in both units burnt up within a month of each other. The units both worked great for the first couple of months, but they just didn't last. I guess you get what you pay for."
2,Works Great but be Careful...,"This product has no problem working, however, it broke just after 4 months. This product is cheaply made. They should change the price to $15. I wouldn't recommend buying it, not at this price!"
5,Aces to the Sellers!!!,6 in 1 Car Kit for Ipod (Black) Car Charger + Fm Transmitter / Holder Full Range Frequency + USB port for MP3 and Cell Phone Charging with Remote ControlSimply perfect!
3,6 in 1 Car Kit for Ipod (Black) Car Charger,"Very pleased with the product and delivery time.6 in 1 Car Kit for Ipod (Black) Car Charger / Fm Transmitter / Holder Full Range Frequency / USB port / Remote Control for iPod, Touch 1G/2G"
2,6 in 1 car kit - tried without an IPOD,"I have a Sony mp3 player which hooks up to the unit, but at full volume on the mp3, the car stereo doesn't have enough volume control and isn't really worth listening to. Has anyone else tried different mp3 players? It says it's supposed to work - if anyone has any ideas I'd love to get this thing to work!"
4,Great product,"The product works great, the quality is a little higher than radio but less than CD's by far. For the price though, it works great and was well worth the money."
4,"pleased, a good purchase","Product shipped quickly, easy set up and quality sound. Very little static if any at all. Overall pleased with my purchase. Price was reasonable!"
1,"Worked for a bit, then stopped","I bought this item and at first, it worked well. Mind you, I don't do a lot of driving, and frequently wouldn't even use it, so it got very little use. One day I had it on and went over a bump and it shut off. I checked it, it was seated well - and I barely touched it and it started up again. It kept doing that - so I figured out there must be a short in there somewhere. I didn't touch it during use other than to plug it in or remove it, and I'm very kind to my electronics. It just isn't well made if someone like me that hardly used it can have issues with it breaking. I was disappointed because it was a neat little item. I did not contact customer service because some things don't seem worth my time."
3,Nice unit but don't expect CD quality sound.,"I just started using this unit 2 days ago. Though the plastic housing is a little cheap I like the overall design. The remote is a big plus! This is my first FM transmitter, so I'm not sure how it compares with other products. But to claim this product will produce CD quality sound is a stretch. It doesn't even come close. FM quality sound is the best you're going to get. I live in large metropolitan area so there is only one unused station, and there is still some static on that station. I spent the first day trying to tone down the treble and reduce the static. The single most beneficial thing I did was to turn off my iPod's equalizer. I tried all the different music settings first then finally just turned it off and that did the trick. I still get static but not nearly as much. If you like your music to have the best sound possible this is not the way to go. Get a stereo that has an auxiliary plug so you don't have to transmit through the radio."
2,Only worth it if you don't have a cassette player in your car,"I bought this item so I could listen to my iPod in the car. It is ""ok"" for what it is. But, the sound quality is not that great. I live in a small town and just about every station has something on it - very few empty stations so it was very hard to find one that the iPod would play over. I didn't realize that you could just get a cassette player adapter to achieve the same (actually better) results. I found one of those at Walmart for $10 and the sound quality is MUCH better on it than trying to run it through an FM station. SO, if you have a cassette player in your car, that is definitely the better route. If not, then your only choice would be to go the FM transmitter route. Maybe you'll have better success finding an empty station than I did."
2,"Good idea, just wouldn't work.","The design was fantastic and should have been easy to use, but it wouldn't make a solid connection with my car's cigarette lighter. Perhaps my iPod video was too heavy, I don't know, but it kept disconnecting. It was surprisingly ""cheap"" looking and feeling, and it almost seemed like it had been used/returned before. I returned it, but was really disappointed."
3,3 in 1 Car Kit for Ipod,"So far my husband loves his gift. Only thing is that it has static here and there when we drive somewhere. Otherwise, a good product!"
1,jaxgirl,"Product did not work upon installation; had a loose screw and was a bit scratched. Satechi responded immediately with Return Material info and apologies. Offered to replace upon receipt of defective item, but we opted to just buy one locally."
1,Worthless,I found this transmitter to be useless. I had problems from the beginning. I had one of the metal piece from the power outlet fall off after a week. I just found this to be a waste of money and I recommend that you don't waste yours!
1,junk,"this product came to us not working . company replaced with new one that did not work also,amzon refunded my money."
4,Good deal!,"I bought this product and so far have really liked it. My husbands Taurus doesn't have as good reception with it as my SUV does but I think it might be something with his car (my last adapter didn't work as well in his car either). I like the option of the remote control. The buttons on mine are raised and its pretty easy to use. Safer than trying to flip though the ipod manually. I also like that it charges my ipod while plugged in. Overall, I'm very happy with this product."
3,It works ok for the money,"When I first found this FM Transmitter, I should of known it was too good to be true. If you want a good Transmitter like this you need to pay more than 50 bucks. This model feels cheap and the sound quality is not that great no matter what station your on. Turning it on is sometimes a hassle, most of the time I dont bother turning it on because I dont feel like trying to out wit a Transmitter. For the price you can only expect so much from it I guess soo dont expect a great sound quality or for it not to break in half-in a week."
3,Amazing to Good to Bad,"When I first got this at Christmas (2009) I loved it and it worked great! Very little static is you just turn the treb down and I found out even less static if you put your iPod on standby mode while listening to a song. However, after mulitple uses, maybe six or seven, it started to loose it's audio output and I found out one of the prongs came loose and slides. This little problem meant to sound on the whole right side of the car. Then when I tried to also tighten the backing, it came loose and won't hold the iPod up. Cheaply made and not worth the money. Better have been made before."
4,Very happy with purchase,This item arrived faster than I had anticipated and is exactly what I was looking for. Easy to use and gives me the opportunity to listen to my ipod touch 3g in the car. Can't listen to some songs as loud as I might like to but don't think that is a product fault just a fact of hooking it up via adapter versus a direct port.
2,it's okay,"I love that this unit has a remote. I hate a couple things about it though. The awkward step up doesn't fit well in my car and I definitely hear static using it. I drive about an hour to work and I set it when I leave home. About 30 minutes later I have to change the station because of the static. Also the part that plugs into the ipod is loose and I have to wiggle it for the sound to work. Overall it does what I want it to do, but isn't ideal."
3,"Works well, easy to use","The reviews are pretty accurate that I read. It was delivered very fast. I was happy with the ease of use. It is easy to transfer between my two cars, however I would agree that it is a bit cheap feeling. I wonder if all the transferring back and forth is going to make it just fall apart. The ipod is easy to hook up and remove.I read about some of the static and experienced it in one of my cars, but not the other. So I don't know if it is more of an antenna issue in my car than the kit. Ironically, it sounds better in my older car with an antenna that doesn't work so well. I was thinking it could be that the older antenna picks up less interference from radio. Just a thought.Overall, knowing what I know now, weighing price and performance, I am still happy I bought it."
4,"Technology fine, basic physics a problem","Have owned this transmitter/charger for about a month and it's been good to me and my ipod as far as i can tell. It transmitts fine as long as there's not a stronger signal coming in (could be difficult in urban areas...), but it is frustrating to change frequencies if a signal does crop up because it changes very, very slowly (making it a dangerous task when driving). Also, the tilting mechanism is all plastic except for the bolt and, despite very careful handling, the plastic keeping the nut in place broke. It cannot handle any torque, a common problem in other reviews as well. I have now super-glued the nut to the device and it stays tilted in position as long as the road is not too bumpy. Other than the chincy construction, it works well, and I will nurse it along for years i'm sure. But there will probably be something better on the market soon, as there is a lot to improve upon."
2,Doesn't fit Subaru,I loved the quality of this product... well made. AFter my first attempt at powering up my ipod using this transmitter I had to return it because it wouldn't power up. Satechi was awesome and did send me a second within a day. Same problem. The head on the power rod may not speak with every car.
5,online car kit for Ipod,I purchased this car kit for my wife on her 37th birthday. We owned an older version that was very bulky and my wife was wanting an upgrade. I researced and decided on this model. It was hit! My wife installed it and has not quit listening on her transit to her job. I give this company and the car kit excellent purchase for the money and quality results.
4,Good Product,"Product is very easy to install and work. After finding a clear station, I found the sound to have alot of static, but after finding another channel, the sound was clear. I will agree with most other reviews that the sound quality is not spectacular, but I was prepared for that. Since my CD player is on its death bed and the cost to fix/replace is prohibited, for $40.00 I am very pleased with the product. The remote control is a nice added bonus!"
2,Functional But BAd design,"the item functionality is GOOD, but the design is very very very bad, the power plug attached to this item is very very short and straight, given that most lighters are either in cavities or inside the ashtrays will give you a hard time to mount it, other than this i can't complain."
4,Great for the price,Great product. The radio signal is sometimes a bit weak and when traveling in CA I had to change the frequency every hour or so. I plug my phone charger in the USB slot. Overall quality is OK. Shipping and customer service were just perfect.
3,6 in 1 Car Kit for Ipod,"Easy to setup and intuative however, the level of volume is somewhat less then say, while using your radio (AM or FM) and CD player."
3,Not bad but...,"Make sure nothing comes near you cigarette lighter outlet, like stick shifts because this item extends several inches out and you can rotate to some extent but if you don't have open space around the lighter at all times, this may not be the right one to buy."
3,FM tuner,"I have had issues with this product, but I think the main reason is because my lighter is so close to my ignition so I tend to bump it all the time. I keep it plugged into my lighter at all times because of other reviews I read. Sometimes it turns off when I touch it to change the song. I don't know if all my bumping has loosen it or what.I like the remote, but it seems like you have to hold it up and point it to the holder."
4,6 in 1 Car Kit for Ipod,I had a few problems with the first one but Satechi offered to replace it immediately with no cost to me. I received it quickly and it performed very nicely. I think my 4th generation Ipod is still a little narrow for a tight hold but larger ones would definitely have a better fit. Once in a while you might hear interferences from radio towers near strong signals but the sound is good otherwise when on the right frequency. The remote is working fine and I love being able to take my preference of music with me this way. Satechi definitely gets 5 stars on customer service.
5,Good Product and fast shipping,"I was not sure how its going to work when I ordered this Ipod accessory online, The shipment was real fast and I received this product in 3-4 days time, When I connected my bipod touch with this I was really amazed. The sound quality of Transmitter is really good and the signal is really powerful as compared to Belkin and only strange thing that I noticed was when I am pass any Ford vehicle I get some noise. I think it has something to do with the frequency that I set, all over I am happy, The handy remote is also really good. I use its Charger option to charge my GPS and sometimes my black berry. (This is a good thing if you use GPS that has USB Charging option, since the power input will be used by this transmitter you can use the USB charger option to charge ur GPS)"
1,iPod adapter,"Its OK buy the operation of the thing is odd. Why does the iPod turn on when the car is turned on but the FM transmitter has to be turned on with the remote? The blast of white noise from the radio is very disconcerting during this interval. And then the opposite happens when you turn the car off. The transmitter shuts down (obviously) but the iPod remains cooking and has to be shut off manually.An update; the screw that clamps the pivot to keep the device at a set angle, pulled out of its mount. The unit is trash now. All things considered this was not a good purchase."
1,HORRIBLE!,"Thia product is absolutely terrible. The arm broke within the day, the music comes through very staticy, and the adjuster to tighten the holder into place rarely stays tight. The only thing it is good for is charging an iPod and my BlackBerry. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
3,"Great reception except in center city, not as durable as I would have liked","Good product that offered me great reception in Philadelphia and the suburbs, but struggled to tune in anytime I was in center city. The device was easy to set up and satechi sent me an extender arm for my unit free of charge since the device would not originally fit in my car. I found though that the arm broke easily and the device would not stay upright after a few weeks unless I lodged it under my dash. After i tired of this product I decided to buy a new car stereo which has been so much more convenient. I would recommend this option to anyone as the difference in price is trumped by the difference in convenience."
5,"Perfect, exactly what I wanted","The unit arrived in perfect condition and works great. It fits easily in my F250 and the sound quality is static free. I've read where some people have had problems...read the directions.As for the seller, I would shop here again and again,went with the basic shippment and the unit was at my front door three days later. Simply put; Awesome, can't beat it."
2,Disappointing,"My main reason for purchasing this unit is the all-in-one features namely USB port for mp3 player, cell phone charging and remote control. However, having recieved and installed the unit I was sorely disappointed:1. The screw to lock the unit in-place broke on day 12. I drive an SUV and I cannot view the IPOD display screen from the driver seat3. There's alot of static when you use the remote.Unfortunately I've come to the conclusion that I will have to purchase another unit."
4,Good Basic Info,"I have NEVER cured any meat before, I have canned meat,everyone has frozen meat, but never cured meat. This is a good basic book. It gives clear directions and suggestions for different products you can use to cure with. (Some of which you can get here a amazon.com). I also like that it gives you the health warnings, when dealing with food, there is no such thing as too clean or too careful. All in all, this book will get you started and keep you safe, but you MUST follow the directions."
4,Building up my library so no time to read-then-review but looks good at first glance,Building up my library so no time to read-then-review but looks good at first glance. Sorry I can't be of more help but it will be a while before I do.
1,check your pages,"This book had pages missing and misplaces. I had to return it for a refund. It had good info, but a bad printing. I will be reordering and hope to get the whole book this time."
3,very good information,We were interested in finding out how to smoke venison sausage. This book gave us all the information that we needed.
4,Has info on a lot of different methods to preserve meat & fish,Reminds me of some different ways my mother talked about her family kept meat fresh before refrigerators where common. We have forgotten alot of those skills so it is very nice to have good books to explain things in simple terms.
5,prepping,we are preppers and this is a must have book!the best part was the curing it gives great instructionshighly recommend this book
5,What I was looking for,"This contained the information I was looking for. I was able to corroborated the info., skills. I don't know about others but it is what I wanted."
3,Great gift.,I bought this for my mom who loves classics. This movie is apparently very hard to find. Great quality !
5,the best ever!,"i seen this movie (actually all three) years ago..it is the best ever..afte 12 years, i still remember the movie...and now i am so glad to see the one of the set is being offered..so, get it..because it is wonderful! do you know how to get the other two movies in this set?"
3,A Great Old Fashioned Romance Movie,This movie was particularly popular in the sixties in the Philippines. It had a fairy tale quality to it that appealed to both the young and the old. Performances were above average and the Austrian Royal settings were wonderful and grandious. It took a awhile for it be released in VHS. I just wish it comes out in DVD together with the 2 other movies about the Empress Elizabeth. This VHS is pure entertainment!
2,Sissi Forever my Love,I was very excited when I found that I could purchase a copy of Romy Schneider's performance as Sissi but I became very disappointed to find out that it was only a summary of her three very popular movies ... I hope someday they will be released in full.
2,A great movie but can't match the original trilogy,"This is by far the most romantic movie I have ever seen. I just can't get tired of this one. The actors are a perfect match for their roles. The only reason I didn't give this one 5 stars is because it's the cut version. You just can't fit all of the charm of the original trilogy into one cut version. What a shame! I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves romance, drama and comedy -- this movie offers a little of everything. But I do wish there was a full version 3-set DVD dubbed in English, because I would love to show it to my children and friends, too. All I have is an old taped copy in German. And that's the only reason I didn't buy this tape and also why I didn't give this one 5 stars. It's just not as good as the original."
3,"I hope, someday this video will be on DVD","When I found out that there was another movie of Sissi and Romy Schneider, called Forever My Love, I was really very excited. Now, I know that there is only a condensation of the three original movies about this romantic woman. I think that it is worth to have the original movies in one DVD someday because the story is beautiful, the actors great and the soundtracks very nice."
1,1.5 out 5 Overall AS AWFUL AS PLAYBOY DVD'S,"I didn't except much from Studio Girl because the Pet Of The Year series is usually the main focus and usually the series to stick to. This DVD could have been much better than it was if there had been some Pets that I was familiar with,but I recall many unknown faces. Its really a shame with so many beautiful Penthouse models this disc could have used women like (Tracie Carmichael,Megan Mason,Juliet Cariaga,,Alexus Winston,Karrie Jacobs)just to name a few. Finally its tame in all scenes but not as bad as the lackluster playboy flicks.ATTRACTIVE WOMEN,POOR DIRECTING AND ONLY SHOWS BREASTS, SKIP THIS AND GET PET OF THE YEAR 2000 WINNER DVD!"
5,5 star gem,"this is great work,the story line alone is 5 stars all the actors male/female are extremely good.veiw this asap"
2,I didn't get it!,"This movie had a simple, easy to follow plot...but I'll have to say I nodded off a few times! River Phoenix did an ok job and Richard Harris was notable, but the overall plot of the movie just simply blew chunks! When the ending arrives you're thinking to yourself...that's it! Not worth buying but definitely worth seeing...after all...all movies are worth seeing whether they're termed good or bad."
1,The most boring western I have ever seen.,"Shut it off after a while. It was so slow getting started that I just could not get into the dull plot. I guess I'm not artsy-fartsy enough to understand it. Watching grass grow would be more entertaining. Give me, THE WILD BUNCH, SILVERADO,RIDERS OF THE PURPLE SAGE, OR LAST STAND AT SABRE RIVER."
4,just a couple instumentals I haven't fallen in love w/yet,"The songs; Julia, Double plus good, and Sexcrime. sell the album on their own they are simply great!"
4,I like it,"I bought the complete set for a guset bathroom.I love the fact it brings live to the bathroom,nice towels,shower curtian.ECT."
4,Does the job!,"This is a great chord encyclopedia for any level player. The diagrams are clear and complete, and the format is well done. I recommend it!"
4,Great book but doesn't fit,"Pros: I've only had this a short time, but it appears that I shouldn't have any trouble finding just about any chord I need.Cons: I'm very disappointed that the description said it would fit in my guitar case. I have a fairly good acoustic Alvarez guitar with a hard case and there's no way I can close the case with the book underneath it. I tried several adjustments - it just won't work."
