3,"Redux: Click, click, a wave of heat and it's all gone",I have had the same experience as JK8. My first drive died under warranty and was replaced. The second one just died. The the warranty was finished. I have my fingers crossed on my third drive.
2,"Overheated Here, Too: Click, Click","Exactly the same problem here. Overheated and can't get to any data. The drive worked fine for two years or so. It was a solid performer and easy to use, but it eventually overheated. It's really solidly made, but it occurs to me now that it's too solid. There should be more vents for cooling and maybe a bigger fan. Especially for a 7200 RPM drive."
5,Great way to increase fluency for young readers!,The songs are funny and engaging and a wonderful way to get children reading fluently. You'll have fun singing the songs along with your children and you'll be amazed at how well they can read the words after learning the songs. Who knew teaching reading to your own child would be so fun and easy?!
1,"Don't Buy This get "" Take Me Out Of The Bathtub "" instead","I bought this book without having read it in advance. I had purchsed "" Take me out of the bathtub "" by the same author and it is great. The songs in that book are very funny and my grand children love to sing them . I originaly checked out a group of books from the library because I loved the illustrator and was happy to find "" Take me out of the bathtub "". Buy this book and forget about Where did they hide my presents ?"
5,Great New Book!!,"Traci Nettleton couldn't be happier when Brad Davidson, the guy who she's been crushing on, who just happens to be the quarterback of the football team, asks her out. Unfortunately, things start to get screwed up when Traci gets an e-mail from her best friend, Corky, who died two years ago. Now Traci needs to find out why she's getting these weird e-mails from Corky, or there will never truly be a Brad and Traci.Sherrie Rose has taken humor, romance, and paranormal phenomena, and placed them all in the novel ""A Girl, A Guy, and A Ghost,"" which is sure to catch the eyes of teen girls everywhere. Traci is your normal teenager, just trying to get through high school. Brad is your All-American Guy. He plays football, is gorgeous, etc. And Corky is a fun friend, even if he isn't part of the living clique. A must-read book for all. Even those who aren't interested in ghosts, or paranormal phenomena.Erika Sorocco"
2,Golf philosophy,"This is the book for golfers who are interested in reflections on golfing. It is also for those interested in golf history. If you expects to improve your swing or get tips to play better golf, this is not the right book.Norwegian"
4,tejano music review,"One word for this dude ""awesome"" thank god amazon put some songs from this dude so u can download them, but this album isn't in there,but I tell u I collect tejano music like crazy and I have this album it has a hit and miss song on this one but over all ,its a pretty good album, pretty much every thing jorge alejandro makes is pretty good, but good luck in finding some of his oldskool stuff.he made a new one last year and it is awesome. Hope this helps."
2,Average Light-Hearted Film,"this was a Light-Hearted Film that was dealing with some subjects but this Film kinda is a lightweight take on TV's ""White Shadow"".still it's Ok in spots."
5,Thought-provoking treatment of issues in data analysis,"Detailed treatment of specific issues in data analysis.Explodes traditional data classes as represented by the classwords of IBM's ""of language"". Tasker concludes that there are only three truly distinct classes of data: labels, quantities, and text.Proposes a thorough entity-relationship model of the components of mailing addresses.Offers several additional canonical entity-relationship models for recurrent thorny problems of data analysis."
3,I didn't see any changes in my cat's arthritis,"I don't understand what this is supposed to do, but my cat's arthritis didn't stop getting worse even when using it. This is just not useful for her.I'll save my money for the vet bill instead."
1,Could not run program,"Could not get this program to run and I'm not sure what the problem was. The disk would show the first screen but I could never get the program to load or run. The PDF manual is very poor and does not have any troubleshooting info and the company does not offer telephone support for this product. I tried an email and did not get a response. I'm not sure what I was doing wrong but since there was no help available, it was quite frustrating.If you are tech savvy this may be a fine program for you but I finally gave up after trying to get it to run several times."
4,Good product,"worked easily as promised. no true way to prove if hard drive is completly clean, but appears to be."
4,Really easy to use in the field,"While not a think of beauty the thing is it works. Sheaths are difficult to use until they're really and I mean really broken in. I've just about always found them to be a two handed operation. They're great for storage but if you really intend to carry a rock hammer for use in the field then get one of these. Point the handle to the sky, slide the pointed or chisel end into the tube, set the hammer head on the 'U' hook and just drop the hammer to the side. The 'U' hook is tall enough that the hammer doesn't easily bounce out. Besides working better than a sheath the Estwing Hammerlock Pick is Holster also cheaper!"
2,bulky and noisy,"I used this holster for 2 field seasons before retiring it. Now I use a $4 Wolverine leather hammer loop that I bought from Home Depot. I gave up on this holster because it's really annoying to have such a big non-flexible object around the waistline when I'm walking up steep slopes and hopping down ledges. Also, the hammer is way too loose in the plastic enclosure so there's a lot of noise generated from even gentle walking. I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 because it did last me 2 field seasons which I did not expect from a plastic object. Save yourself the annoyance and go to the hardware section of Home Depot and get a belt-loop hammer holster."
2,"Good Product, but out of scale","It is not useful to attach on the belt. Too big to carry on fieldtrips. However, it have worked well to keep my hammer organized on my garage wall."
4,Rocky Mountain High,"Do like this holster... as it is easy to remove and place the hammer back into position, not like it's leather counterpart. The only drawback is that it is rather large and constantly squeaks when you are walking. Large is fine, but the squeaking does become annoying on longer hikes. The squeak can be remedied by cutting thin rubber adhesives and mounting it onto the holster. Waiting for the perfect model to come onto the market... but until then, this works fine."
5,Exactly what it needs to be...,"If you read my review of the Estwing E3-23LP pick hammer I bought, I mention just how utterly perfect this holder is for the hammer.As I stated in that review, this holder was bigger than I thought it would be, but not bigger than it needs to be. It is also stronger than I thought it would be. So that's good.It fits on my belt just fine and stays put. I really couldn't imagine carrying around my Estwing 16"" long-handled pick hammer in a hammer loop--pulling the entire handle up through the loop by the head? No way. This holder is a dream. You can remove the hammer by the handle; just swing the handle up and slide out. Awesome.Don't be a cheap a$$ and go for a $4 construction loop. Spend the extra few bucks and give your hammer what it deserves. When you're hiking and climbing, this holder does a superior job keeping it on your side, as well as from digging into your side."
4,Often Overlooked,"This CD may not have the classic material of Born To Run, Greetings, or E Street, but it sure beats the clunker Human Touch. The sounds were written from the heart and mind instead of merely meeting a deadline. I miss the E Street Band and some of the backing vocals are cheesey but with excellent songs like Lucky Town, Better Days, My Beautiful Reward, and Waist Deep In The Big Muddy, this CD stands pretty tall."
4,Underrated Boss Gem,"Hey- this is Bruce so it's going to be good. Okay so maybe I'm biased as a big fan, but seriously this CD has some really good songs, and for such a low price is worth an addition to your rock collection. Local Hero is my favorite track, and Leap of Faith is good too. BRUCE!!! Buy it."
3,"A solid album, but it never really takes off","I ended up with ""just"" three stars for this one. ""Lucky Town"" is really not a bad album (if it was, I would not have given it three out of five!), but it never starts to soar. The title track is very good, but most of the remaining songs on the album just sort of goes by without really being noticed. They're not bad, you don't scream and throw yourself across the room to pull the plug when one of them comes on the radio, but they're just not all that interesting, lyrically or musically. Sure, Bruce Springsteen's lyrics are better than most, even when they're below average, but this is definately not ""Tunnel of Love"" or ""Nebraska"" or...well, you get the idea."
3,Right down the middle,"With the exception of Book of Dreams, there isn't a bad song on this album! Several mediocre ones (Big Muddy; Leap of Faith; Local Hero; Souls of the Departed), but several I like (title song; Living Proof; If I Should Fall Behind; Better Days; My Beautiful Reward). Really, I don't see why this is so despised when eighth-rate works like Nebraska and Tunnel of Love are lauded: it's no Born to Run, and it's sheer mediocrity, but I'd take mediocrity over awfulness any day."
4,A charming album of adulthood and assurance,"This is one of Bruce's most underrated CD's. It's the first album in many years where he didn't sound as if he was struggling with inner demons. The opening song, ""Better Days,"" certainly makes this point in a forthright way. In addition, the title track rocks, ""If I Should Fall Behind"" is one of the Boss' most beautiful songs, and ""Leap of Faith"" uses biblical metaphors to describe the start of a delightful relationship. I also like the darker numbers ""Souls of the Departed"" and ""The Big Muddy."" But generally speaking, this is a sweet snapshot of secure love, in contrast to the collapsing romances depicted on Bruce's earlier album, The Tunnel of Love. You can usually see this CD in used CD bins. Don't hesitate to pick it up."
4,A triumph,"If you read through the various reviews here you might get the impression that Bruce's ""Happy"" album is a lighthearted trip among the fluffy clouds but that wouldn't be accurate. Springsteen isn't some dreamy-eyed fella sitting peacefully in a garden full of fragrant flowers here, he's a guy emerging from a culvert covered in blood, sweat and tears who is relieved to find the light at the end of a dark tunnel. His voice is so great on this album, revealing a man who has rediscovered his faith in love. Overall it doesn't contain the musical power that he pulls out of the E Street Band but his emotion-filled vocals have never been more piercing and effective. These are terrific songs of triumph and hope and overcoming heartache through introspective perseverance."
2,Cambridge Sounsworks PlayDock,"Large, bulky item that we rarely use becasue it takes up too much space, and is too heavy. But the sound quality is very good..."
1,What a waste of the Music Industry,"Sisqo and his thong song are a waste of time, this song is annoying, boring and played out. This song as well as Sisqo's album are a waste of the hip-hop/R&B industry as well as the whole music industry. I find watching grass grow more entertaining than Sisqo's music."
1,sexist carbon hip-hop copy,"Now c'mon. There's nothing wrong with singing about women but THONGS! This is a bunch of chauvinistic crap that Sisqo knew would sell. Everytime someone releases a song with the words ""Bitch"", ""Dick"", ""sex"", etc in it, it sells by the bucketload. This is clearly in that category. As for the actual song, it really isnt that good. The chorus is downright annoying. i wonder about the buying public around the word. They are so easily brainwashed. This song is currently number 2 in Australia and will undoubtedly go to Number 1. This is just an indication of the sad nature of the music industry"
3,Neutral,"I am just neutral about this song (or the Thong Song for that matter). First, I don't get the lyrics. The beat is fun, though. Second, what is a thong song?Anyways, I think Sisqo made this just for fun. I don't really like it and I don't really hate it. Whenever it's played, I just listen, and until now, I am still ambiguous about this song."
5,"Hey Sisqo, I wear 'em too!!!","Hey Sisqo, I wear 'em too!!!Dude,I'll dance for you.You should see me.Call me.(909)-795-6080-Sammi Morris"
5,RUN - do not walk - to get this!,"As someone not terribly familiar with this type of music, I find myself utterly captivated by the ""Thong Song"".I heard it one day at brunch in a cafe and couldn't get it out of my head for days. All efforts to track the song down and identify its performer proved fruitless. I eventually RAN DOWN THE STREET after a car from whose speakers the song was blaring, and pleaded with the driver to tell me who the singer was. At the next stoplight I hit paydirt: ""Sisqo!"" he laughed. ""That's Sisqo, man!""Well, I am totally hooked on this stuff now. This is like the second coming of the 2 Live Crew! A bawdy song, maybe, but with a beat that just does not quit. Do yourself a favor - pick this up. And don't walk, my man, RUN!"
5,Thong Thong Thong Thong Thong,"This is a catchy R&B rap song from the lead singer of Dru Hill, Sisqo. This is one of my favorite raps. I don't like hip hop much but I love this song. Half the people I know hate it and the other half love it but I really love it. Buy the cd single if not the whole Sisqo album! This guy is talented. And he has nice hair too!"
1,"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible!","What is up with this song? Sisqo doesn't even sing it at his concerts. This is sad sad material from just a novielty artist who doesn't even hold a torch to the mickey mouse club. For heaven sake, what did he do to himself. Most of Sisqo's fallowers think people like me have wierd hair! This guy is just a wanna be music artist who can't sing but thought that he could maybe do this instead of joining some dance group."
4,THONG SONG DA BOMB,"Hey Everyone!! Just wanted to fill you Folks in and tell you that this CD is even better then the first.. Most Imports don't rank that High but I give this a 11 out of 10.. If your like me you feel sorta scared on weather you want to purchase imports or not.. But, I Promise you this time you wont be disappointed! To me it even sounds better then the Origanal Thong Song.."
5,"Bangin' Song by Sisqo a.k.a. The Dragon called ""Thong Song""","Sisqo is already my favorite male singer so I support whateva he puts out there. Everyone should pick up his album, but if you don't do that then atleast give the ""Thong Song"" a chance. It's hot you won't regret buying it and you won't be able to stop playing it once you start. So buy the single put it on repeat and enjoy Sisqo's beautiful vocals as they glide over the made for the club hip-hop/classical beat. Sisqo's ""Thong Song"" is the best. Do yourself a favor and pick it up. It's TOO HOT! If you enjoy that then pick up ""Unleash the Dragon"" it's up here so pick it up! Help me out...Sisqo's #1 TRUE fan and just get it...'cause guess what?...""You Got to Get it""(:"
2,"Yeah, it's ok...","This one's ok, but if you're going to buy a recording of this, spend a little more and go with one of the studio recordings. For one, the sound quality is bad and unbalanced (it is a live performance) and Faust sounds strangulated most of the time. Samuel Ramey is very good though. I bought this because it was cheap--bad idea. It has inspired me to buy a studio recording though, because of some musical gems this opera has, such as much of the choral music, and the prologue and epilogue."
1,"The ""Mefistofele"" from Hell","The good--Well, Ramey isn't bad. Snarls a bit, but not embarrassing. The bad--Unfortunately, just about everything else is. Cupido as Faust gets booed after 'Dai Campi' and I'm sorry to say I agree with the audience. Dessi is no more than a pretty voice coping with a role that doesn't quite sound right for her. Bartoletti tries to keep the massive forces under control and succeeds at times, but interpretation only comes in fits and starts. The sound is shallow, dry, and not expansive enough in this live recording. The ugly--Orfeo D'Or is hit or miss. When they have a good recording, it's terrific (Eugene Onegin, Turandot with Nilsson and Corelli) but when it's bad, it's a trainwreck (see also Rigoletto with Pavarotti and Scotto)."
3,Disappointing mixed bag,"A disappointing mixed bag of Chicago Blues exponents. Consummate and satisfying performances from Otis Rush and Robert Lockwood Jnr., with Rush in superb form particularly on 'Mean Old World' - which is worth the price of the CD on its own. On the other hand, for me Mighty Joe Young is not in the same league with very unpolished performances and second rate vocals. The Roosevelt sides are also unlistenable with too much vocals and brass backing and not enough blues piano work for my liking."
3,Wrong order delivered,"i paid for 60 wafers (as shown in the picture) but the smaller bottle of 30 wafers was delivered! Other than that, it is a product that i would buy constantly. How would i get the other 30 wafers?"
3,Informative.,A rehash of John Dee & Edward Kelly's work with the Enochian tablets. The Mass is written with some good tastes. The movie illustrates the points that are difficult to understand in the written version. Lots of gestures like in the Crowley Gnostic Mass.
5,It was a gift,"I bought this for my best friend, he's owned this bible before but lost it. He was totally excited that it was on amazon. He is a Anton LaVey fallower, so this book is apart of him. :)"
5,A Very good read for a beginner,"Anton Szandor LaVey's book_The Satanic Bible_ is a very good, oversimplified but brilliant `bible` for a beginner Satanist or anyone juat interested to understand one of the most maligned philosophies in the world. It is a book that describes, in simple language, Satanism;both the philosophy and the rituals. It is a must for a wannabe Satanist;a TRUE Satanist interested in the LaVeyan point of view-A MUST... ... ..."
5,fantastic and a must,"Anton LaVey squashes the stereotypical and/or church point of view on satanism with this honest and resourceful book. i am 15 years old and tried to accept christianity, but they are hypocrytical and don't give anyone a chance. i was sick of people preaching to me whats ""right"" and whats ""wrong"", when i should be able to make to make up my own mind. the Late Great Anton LaVey gave me that chance, and even if people judge me because of what i believe, thats their choice, because they aren't open minded enough. i am happy, and i think that this book has helped me... everyone should read it, it should be compulsory and be given as much publicity as the christian Bible."
3,Never before have I looked at society like I do now.,"This is one of the most revealing and compelling books you are ever going to read although, a lot would consider this book to be blasphemous considering its title. I urge you to read and to try to absorb what is written therein. It could change the very way that you live or the very way in which you view life. Anton was a master of his craft, a gifted individual. It is through his teachings, that we might understand the truth behind Satanism."
5,One of the best books I have read,WOW! read this book it is the best. It promotes some very good ideas. I am not a Satanist anymore but I still think it is a great book.
3,think for yourself,i bought this book at a time when i did not know how to think for myself and i needed guildence but now i look at it and all i see is indocrination lavey pulls the wool over your eyes he is no better than the christians with his propaganda you look at this book it just his opinion on the way you should live your life it preachs to think for yourself but really lavey is thinking for you and honestly its not even that intelligent its just blunt and straight forward think before you buy into the bs
1,Ho hum,"The book is very disjointed and lacks a real depth of information. It runs on and on about the same basic theme. I could sum up the philosophy of this book in one phrase ""If it feels good, do it"". Now you don't have to read it. But if you still feel you have to read it, put it in the bathroom. That's really where it belongs!"
2,Silliness,"As has been stated, there is nothing really orginal about this book. Certain parts of it are amusing, many are boring and the occasional good idea is nothing that can't be found in the works of earlier writers. All LaVey did was apply some dark theatrics to secular and nihilistic ideas with some slamming of Christianity thrown in for good measure. And yet it's funny how much money and attention he received from it."
4,Good Philisophy,The Satanic Bible is good but not great enough. The Enochian Keys are not tra nslated in English so couldn't quite understand what it means. Apart from that this a great philosophy of Mr. Late Anton La Vey. A must buy if you are an atheist. Here he didn't recognize Father Satan as the real being. Actually Father Satan is our true GOD.HAIL SATAN
2,The man had no Idea what he was talking about.,I am only speaking inreference to Satanic Bible & Satanic verses. I will not speak ill of the dead.
4,Ahh Dear..,"how does one rate this? Mere S&M image? Ahh..Love..Love..I see the faces of people I love and I think..Image..Catharsis..This is what the Satanic Bible is.The fascists are lonely.I'm there,I'm lonely.But my heart lies..Somewhere that time may see only.And am I loved? The Wiccans will let me know..Adieu fair morTalS I love thee.."
1,Worthless Tripe,"Awful awful awful, on so many levels. Don't even waste your time reading these reviews..."
1,Sickening,This book is sickening. It is filled with truly satanic garbage that nobody with half a brain should ever read.
1,satanic bible,"After reading this rubbish, one thing is clear : satan is scared and his downfall is coming. He was beaten by the Cross and he will be beaten again.Praise be to God."
5,Don't judge it until you read it!,"LaVey explains in great detail the ins and outs of satanism. To the ignorant, this book may seem evil, but is really an excellent work than makes alot more sense than the bible."
4,Si no tiene mas nada que hacer...,"Este es un buen libro para entretenerse solamente. No se puede tomar en serio, ya que este es el punto de vista de Lavey. Cualquier persona que decida convertirse al satanismo tiene que buscar mas información acerca de la religión y no dejarse llevar por este libro solamente."
5,"The Satanic Bible, la base du satannisme moderne",The Satanic Bible est la référence pour tout ceux qui veulent s'initier au satanisme moderne. Anton Szandor LaVey nous fait découvrir la vérité au sujet du satanisme.
3,I liKe..,For the historiCal (for the old sentiMental ways..)record I like..For the black..FoR the sexual arousal..God loves..Hey..I want this to remain forever the coolest most explosive art expression availabLe..Dig it like the beat poets!
3,An interesting explanation,"This book covers a side of human nature that has been revealed anew by the author. People need to express their base passions, while at the same time they need their rituals and icons. ""Satan"", according to LaVey, is the iconoclast of the base(and sometimes cruel) passions that drive men and women in their quest for pleasure that God, it is perceived, denies them of. According to LaVey, Satan, rather than being an adversarial force seeking the downfall of mankind, is a force for carnal pleasures and rather than seeking to subjugate mankind to evil, seeks to free him of the restraints of conventional morality and, in a sense, deify man rather than God. While on philosophical grounds I may disagree with LaVey's premise, it adds a whole new side to the debate of what is the nature of man."
5,I stumbled upon this book...,"I read this book from mere curiosity. Once I began to read it I could not put it down. I read the book twice in two nights, and have continued to read it again, and again. It has since changed my life, and dilated my mind. ... Those of you who'll understand this book will have been born to understand. Let the critics critisize, and grin inside as they attempt to ""classify"" it."
3,time to grow up,"I've noticed that most of the people who have reviewed this book come from the southern usa where there is a proliferation of churches and where christianity in all its twisted forms is shoved down your throat! I should know, because that is where I have lived all my life. I know the Satanic bible by heart, but I have found something out over the years. There is more to life than religion, where everyone thinks their way is the only way. Life happens to contain a little bit of everyone's beliefs combined. And if you don't believe me, just wait a few years when you finally grow up and you'll understand that life is not black and white. That belief is for the really lazy and ignorant!"
2,A fun bit of common sense followed by a lot of yak dung,"I will admit that I have not read the entire thing. ONLY BECAUSE I CAN'T. The first half consists of the whole satanist philosophy, but then Anton LaVey proceeds to contradict himself by adding an extensive section on rituals. This is the part I could not swallow. (but hey! I tried to open the gates of hell on my TV screen, and when I turned it on FULL HOUSE was on, so it might not be all bunk after all!) Overall: VERY interesting the first 100 pages, But just a silly coffee table or toiletside book after that."
4,Satanic Bible,"A suprisely good read, don't be put off by the title. This book is basically about humanism. If you were brought up in strictly religious enviroment, I think you will find this a liberating and mind expanding read."
5,Superb ! an excellent book!,This is a brilliant insight into the dark side of religion and should be read by all religious enthusiasts!
5,A lesson in common sense for degenerated americans,"Needless to say, there's much more to it. Read the book, goddamit.If you fail, read it twice.And if you still nag about ""here-after"" and ""it doesn't still tell you about Satan"",you can always go buy yourself a 9mm and put it in your mouth.Recommended.One whined about LaVeys mesmeric talents.Oh christ,it's tragicomic to see a marionette blaiming heretics.I guess your house is full of kosher..jerk. Ad Nauseam."
3,Has it's good points...,"I found this book to be quite intriging (parts, anyway) but although Mr. Lavey may have a point in pointing out the deception of christianity, yet fails to point out his own deceptions. We as a human race are ignorant to fall into any form of beleif be it satanism, atheism, or christianity. Pretending to know what one could not possibly know is simply a facade to make one appear as if they know more than they really do."
3,kinda nuts,"ive read some of laveys other books, they were alright but anton must of been off the rocker when he wrote this book.human sacrifices,spells, nutzo!there is some good points to this book,but i would reccomend reading satan speaks or the devils notebook before reading this."
3,sketchy and contradicting...but interesting,"satanism is open minded, yet it is also close minded the way he shuts off all other religions. i am not religious at all, and i think that they're all silly ways of having something to follow. however, the philosophies in this 'bible' were definately either inspiring or the opposite. whatever which way, i always had some opinion on it. that's why it's a book worth reading. the only question is: is it worth seven bucks to read??"
4,This book introduced me to a side of Satanism I never knew,"Even though I am not a Satanist, (I am atheist) I found this book interesting, and introduced new facts to me that I didn't know. A lot of the things in it made sense to me. I strongly agree that christianity is a bunch of crap!"
2,"Cute, but not great","Fun to read, I would give it 4 stars, but...I took 1 star away for being derivative (the whole Book of Satan is copied from Redbeard's Might Is Right). I also had to take another star away for hypocrisy. The truly open-minded ones will see thru LaVeyan Satanism. It's no different from Christianity in a fundamental sense. The COS is a club for sheep in dog's (sorry, you don't even rate high enough for wolves') clothing. They may have no problem with breaking God's laws, but oh how they squeal with devotion to the laws of man. [Unbelievable!] Keep this book away from 14 year olds --let them read Stirner instead, if they're smart enough to handle it."
2,Attention grabbing book that is empty.,"As Satanism used to be a parody of christianity, drawing power from it's host and also setting itself up as its rival, so is neo-satanism to satanism. All this book does is use ""Satanism"" as an attention grabber and then twists it to become a psychology lesson on introspection. The book is poorly written and jumpy, but to give it credit its very imperfection leads the reader to ponder on his/her own. This is the ONLY redeeming feature of this book."
2,"Boring, silly nonsense","Lavey gives a bold paean to hedonism (sort of an Ayn Rand without the production of anything actually useful), but that's hardly an honest exegesis of Satanism. Until Lavey is willing to state one of the key elements of Satanism--enjoyment of and search for pain and destruction--he will only be a weak sister to the real thing.And to all you wanna-be tough acne-faced adolescents looking for meaning, who think that by reading this book you might actually find something to guide your rudderless lives, better to study Satre or Kierkkegard, to understand what true existentialism is."
2,Poor,"I found Anton Lavey's ""bible"" for Satanism to be pretentious and annoying, with most righteous or agreeable ideas being taken from the works of Ayn Rand, Ragbar Redbeard, Aleister Crowley, and Friedrich Nietszche, only without the brilliance of any of them. Just naming the ethical philsophy within the book ""Satanism"" is ultimately contradictory and obviously only there for shock value.Not a suggested read."
3,take everything with a grain of salt.,"im a big fan of satanic philosophy and Anton LaVey. I love his humor and the points he brings up in this book. its truly a shame how misunderstood satanism is.on the other side, i found many of the stated facts to be unsupported and opinions being shoved down my throat.The latter half of the book described rituals and listed the Enochian keys which i find fascinating but he doesnt really go into detail about these things. ... i thought this was the satanic bible!however, as LaVay describes, the word ""Belial"" means ""without a master"". Satanists are supposed to be individuals and form their own ideas and opinions about the world around them, Never to be blindly led or take someone else's ideas as fact. and this book is no exception.I just wish it was more about satanism and less about how much Christianity sucks."
3,Quinky traveler is the game!,"You may expect a certain kinky quacks from a certain manifestation in side of you. There is no limit to the endless toils of a virgin lost! I liked this book, but helium ballons for the partly psyco and satanic soul is MUCH better!"
4,This book is an affirmation of humanity.,"Readers will find THE SATANIC BIBLE exposes those ""dark"" inherent qualities in a human being, and brings them to ""light"". LaVey is not a gentle man in his writing; rather, he is a truthful man. Touching on subjects such as altruism and psychic vampires, he reveals a philosophy that could be considered the cornerstone of christianity -- being that it is everything they shamefully deny. LaVey introduces us to a philosophy that allows us to be human -- without guilt or shame, but with the call to be full in our humanity."
5,A genious piece of work,Finally some one dares to explain the truth about satanism and satanic rituals. I for one applaud the work of Mr. Lavey. A MUST READ for any satanist or for some one who is open-minded and wants to understand modern and traditional satanism.
5,Contrasting Satanism and Witchcraft/Wicca,"The Satanic Bible is definitely one of the best sources on the religion. But if disturbs me that so many people mix it up with wicca and witchcraft. I have read about those things and they don't even believe in Satan. I really don't see why people always assume that. If anyone is going to judge this book wrongly then they must be misinformed. I think if you are being critical then read this book you will understand. And please people, get your facts straight!"
2,so-so,"as a person who doesn't care about god or satan, therefor making me un-biased, i'd have to say the book wasn't that good. and it was really boring (about as boring as the HOLY bible, maybe a little more) and the guy had one or two good points. but on the whole, i think he was just looking for an excuse to act like a fool. save you're time and read a romance novel...."
2,plagarized writtings,"Anton Lavey's satanic bible is a joke of satire,where even the key points were taken from the writtings of Aleister Crowley. Lavey never ackowleged Aleister Crowley as a Satanist,unlike the F.O.S.and traditional satanism which roots come from Aleister Crowley's O>T>O order.The C.O.S.has declined in members after Anton Lavey's death,Even his own daughter Karla Lavey has left."
1,This book sucked,"It made life seem so miserable, I think that the real bible is much more interesting, based on the fact that it is true. This bible is so full of crap, that I have never read so much crap in my life."
1,Stupid,"I know satanists aren't THIS dumb, even though I am not a satanist (Actually a Christian). And is it possible for a jock to be a satanist? Yes. Isn't everyone different? This is too much like a horroscope, and it doesn't even make sense to me.BUT, to me Jesus freaks usually have at least one awful situations, and you can't call yourself something without knowing the meaning.Get a life and avoid this!"
1,MAY ALL THE HORRORS OF HELL FALL UPON ALL WHO READ THIS BOOK,"I have read this book with an open mind and it still couldn't be further from the truth. Although Satanism is not just a defined as only religon but as well as the study of humanism (the right to be human and accepting the mistakes that a human makes). I don't feel that humanism is wrong, but I do think people just try to get away with to much and try to blame it on someone else. This book is something yet to be truly explored. And to those who say its not evil where in this book does it tell you anything about trying to lead not a fun life but about a life without forgiveness form you true creator. A life with the absence of God is not a life at all......."
1,this book is really bad,"I looked at this book and thought it was all made up. I think Anton worked the paper press him self to make this book that is how screwed up this book is. Hell, when I looked on the bookshelf every satanic bible was a different SIZE."
3,"Mr Crowley, this is Ms Rand.","Anton LaVey tells us that selfishness is a virtue, and I agree. When I look back on my life, I can't help remembering all the times people who tried to intimidate me into sacrificing my best interests for theirs would inevitably call me ""selfish"".For example, my third grade teacher, who derived great pleasure from forcing me to annually re-enact what for years was the most embarassing moment of my life. I wanted to live it down, but when I protested, the response was always the same: ""Kevin, stop being selfish!""But LaVey's position isn't original, and, in fairness, he didn't exactly say it was. When this book first appeared, Ayn Rand had already published _The Virtue of Selfishness_ (although she wasn't the first to hold this position, either). What _is_ original is the way LaVey synthesized Ayn Rand with Aleister Crowley -- and, considering the Randian contempt for ""mysticism"", Ayn Rand's ""objectivist"" fans should find the ease with which that can be done disturbing."
3,The Church of Satan's Confusing Bible,"A rather confusing collection of essays and verse that comprises The Church of Satan's bible and philosophy. Like the books of the Christian bible, the essays and verse contained here are not necessarily sequential.This book is a ""must read"" if one is to understand The Church of Satan, but its use of vague imagery sometimes masks the underlying philosophy. I suggest that after reading ""The Satanic Bible"", one read ""The Satanic Rituals"" (five star) for a clearer picture."
4,A unique piece of Americana,"If you haven't read it, read it. After this book came out, Satanism was never the same. This is a piece of history and thus is beautiful. Now LaVey's SATANISM is SATANISM. ""Dualism is alive, long live the other side of the coin"" etc. etc.... Whether you're the cowboy wearing the black hat or not, you should read this book for the mere fact that it is printed, published, and on shelves across the U.S. of A."
5,"""You Are Your own Redeemer""","The only book that emphasizes the importance of oneself, the importance of indulgence, influencing men to break the Seven Sins, for they are keys to his existence. If humans were strong enough, more would read this book, for it sets men free!"
2,"Historic curiosity, but not very useful.","Lavey's idea of Satanism is atheism wrapped in sensationalism: once a carnival barker, always a carnival barker. There is no reason to call it ""Satanism"", particularly in light of the emergence of religious Satanism (actual worship of demonic 'gods'), unless you count the unrelenting slag on Christianity. He does provide some fun, sarcastic shockers in his statements and in presenting sins as virtues, but there is really nothing original or innovative here. Critical readers will be amazed at his dogmatism and morality while claiming to abhor both. Serious occultists will be appalled by his absurd translations of the Enochian Keys. Teens can keep a copy on the shelf to cheese-off mom and offend the neighbors."
5,This is LOGIC!,"I don't want to sound overzealous here, but the Satanic Bible is refreshing. It's based on logic and reason, from a purely atheistic standpoint. Really, the ""Satan"" LaVey uses is simply a literary metaphor, a symbol, that stands in stark contrast to Christian ideologies. There is nothing remotely religious or spiritual about it. It's simply a glorification of happiness and life, which is, I think, a very noble endeavor. However, I want to hasten to add that anyone out there who's going to pick this book up as a manual for demon-raising is clearly mistaken. This wasn't the author's intent. Overall, a beuatiful, if somewhat simplistic, look at the first philosophy of logic that incorporates art and dark beuaty. A wonderful book that is sure to bring a smile to your face with its humor- read it, if only to dispell any previous misconceptions. Hail Satan! Have a nice day."
3,I'm not a satanist but.......,"I am not a satanist but reading this book taught me that satanism is not what most people think it is. Everyone who thinks satanism is evil should read this book. It really puts everything into perspective. Anyone who has a warped image of what satanism is should read this book. It is really just a ""looking out for number one"" type of ""religion"". The only person you can rely on is yourself. The picture of Anton Levey isn't bad either. I think the bald head is [nice]."
2,nothing new under the sun,"In a nutshell, a lot of fluff and no stuff. i expected much more, this ""bible"" was a lot of hype and trype. The basic premise is that satanism is misunderstood, that it isn't blood sacrifices of animals and babies but that it is simply the worship of the self. So Levey simply bithered on about hedonism and threw in a few spells and rituals. The whole text just seemed to be borrowed information; an admixture of hedonism, theosophy, philosophy,crowleyisms, etc... etc...and all of this presented in a very superficial overly simplified way.There was nothing in the text that prompted the reader to think or ponder as many spiritual concepts do. In fact, it seemed very kindergartenish in comparison to christianity, budhism, zen, taoism, just to name a few. i wouldn't waste your money."
3,Interesting but only philosphically,"There is more truth here than in most books of this type. Though Anton LaVey is just as full of crap as the people who decided on what books should be included in the bible.Man is an animal, but when you start comparing yourself as the opposite of the Christian bible, well, one has to wonder at the intent.Thid book was released to make money and not provide, well anything worthwhile.All of that being said, the book has some philosophic merit."
3,The Art of the Carnival,"Anton LaVey was certainly a very astute man, and a fascinating character too. This book is good in many aspects: It can be a powerful antidote for those who have never seen any but mainstream thoughts expressed before; it can provide a channel for people who are seeking to increase the outlets for power, control, and the 'evil' emotions in their life instead of repressing themselves; it avoids the violent and illegal craziness that cat-sacrificing, media (and Christian leader) promoted varieties of 'Satanism' may inspire; and it can provide grounds for a tasty lawsuit if brought into the right public-school classroom.However, in the long run, the truly powerful option is to forge your own identity and philosophy in life. Therefore, while reading and even somewhat agreeing with this book is fine, simply taking in its precepts hook, line, a sinker would prove to be as much a mistake as doing the same for any other religion or school of thought."
4,interesting philosophy,"It's worth a read if you can get past the title. The first half of the book gives some history and preaches Hedonism/Satanism as a way of life. I'm not religious, but it made me look at my life from a different angle. Absorb the philosophy, apply it to your life, and then throw the last half of the book away (it's just ""spells"" for the gullible)."
3,Interesting,"It was an interesting read and LaVey had an interesting viewpoint on things. I can't agree on the magical standpoint he takes, but it is definitely an eye opener into LaVeyan Satanism. Other than that, I'd recommend it to be read once or twice."
4,Almost 20 years later,"I stole my first copy of this book from a bookstore at our local mall when I was 15 years old. It scared the hell out of me. Looking back on it now, it was mostly common sense and obvious observations. It was well written and I give Anton credit for that. The thing that scared me was the fact that no matter how hard I tried to get rid of the book it always ended up back in my hands. I gave it away, threw it in the garbage and even tried burning it, but somehow it always ended up finding it's way back to me."
1,"I am not a Satanist, Christian, or Wiccan","If you want Humanist ideals, be a Humanist not a Satanist, if you want no institution be an anarchist(go to anarchy.org good site)and anyway if Satanism is against institutionalized religion, why is it an institution? and why does it have all these uneccessary rites(I have been to Satanicchurch.com and YES no matter what a Satanist tells you, they are into rituals and stuff), if you are a strong supported of individuality don't be a conformist, all of their ideals are contradictory to others, or you don't need their religion for"
3,Hilarious,"Lavey has done it again! He's taken some flak before for writing cack-handed rubbish, but on this occasion he deserves a C+ for effort. Jokes are few and far between, though, but there are a couple of good stories on pages 15 and 19, relating to the old joke about someone confusing Satan for Santa. My gripe, if I have one, is that he takes it all a bit seriously."
5,A classic book for free spirits,"I would highly recommend this book to intelligent people who choose not to follow the herd. This book has great commentary on the nature of humans, society, religion, and the self-imposed oppression of modern man. Strong,confident, women might really enjoy LaVey's writings (in any of his books) on feminism and sexuality.However, if you don't have the mental capasity to look at different philosophies in an objective manor, or if you want to hurt animals or children in some sort of sick tribute to Ozzy, this book is not for you. Occult students who can't laugh off a little bit of cheese now and then should probably save themselves the pain this book causes on the terminally hip."
5,Simple and True,"We all love a good book. This is it, whether or not you agree with the views presented or not. It has nothing but logic bound in its pages and if any bad comments are to be said about the author, they can have their opinion, but a true Satanist knows that LaVey was a great leader."
1,A waste of time,"It took me 5 or so hours to read this book. No, I'm not incompetant or a slow reader, it's just that I was laughing more than half of the time I was reading.I am not a whining christian, feeling threatened by more anti-god blasphemy. I am an atheist. I do agree with some opinions expressed throughout this book, but it's nothing original. Only more of Nietzsche-like philiosophy peppered with violence and set upon a flashy background of LaVey's choice.And I have no clue what the hell he was thinking when he wrote the third chapter. Horrible, incoherent ramblings of black magic and crazy rituals.Overall, I feel this is better time spent with more renowned philosophical materials."
2,"Some interesting thoughts, but barely scratches the surface","When I first saw the book, I was surprised to see how little and/or thin it was. But I thought ""quality over quantity."" While there are some interesting philosophical thoughts, it is VERY shallow. I thought LaVey would at least be indepth, and insightful, but there's not much new information here, and I don't think anything he wrote hasn't been written before him. Add to that the completely laughable ritualistic descriptions and it's hard to take this book seriously. I mean, I didn't think I could shoot fire from my fingernails after reading the Satanic Bible, but I didn't even get any real insight into man's deepest, darkest thoughts and desires. Maybe in the '60s counter-culture movement this was considered extreme literature, but by today's standards it's not very shocking nor is it very informative."
2,GOT ME KICKED OUT OF BIBLE STUDIES!,There I was in bible studies class reading my cool new SATANIC BIBLE!! and just as I finnished the Chapter on Killing my parents and biting the head ff a chicken MY stupid Bible studies teacher took it from me!!! Well long story short she took the satanic bible and gave me a real bible. Turns out the real bible is more violent than that dumb book. So what do I recomend..? READ THE REAL BIBLE!! if your into some grusome stuff I recomend the part ware jesus beats the LVING TAR!!! out of the money changers for working on sundays LOL!! GO JESUS!! damn that man had a right hook that even tyson could not match. So in conclusion if your looking for a reason to do drugs rape kids and pretty much have a copeing methoid to do unmoral crap read this book. BUT!! if your looking for the coolist most violent biblical storie ever told about man and god GET THE BIBLE!!GO WAL-MART!! opps I Mean SATAN! lol (P.S. if you read the book back wards you can hear hidden cahtolic messages)
2,The path and philosophy of gratification of the base ego,"It is despicable how LaVey includes the Enochian Keys as part of his system. Now many people actually associate the Enochian system with Satanism or black magic. I give this one two stars because it definitely keeps your interest, and almost everyone at one time in his life -- usually in the teenage years -- can identify with some of the philosophies put forth in the Satanic Bible. But these things are meant to be outgrown, as one learns the tremendous setbacks of a fundamentally self-centered mindset and lifestyle. The rituals -- particularly the curses -- will in all likelihood blow up in your face and cause you some species of misfortune if you choose to practice them. The strength of this book is in LaVey's personal philosophies and insights -- not very far off from Ayn Rand's Objectivism."
1,Stolen idea.,"I got this book only because i was very curious. What i find out ? Almost the whole book, the idea, the ideology is basically stolen from another book.Might is Right - Ragnar Redbeard."
1,Not a Rich Book,"The most interesting prose in the book are poor imitation of Nietzsche's work. Unless you're interested in Satanism, this book will be a waste of money."
3,"The Christian Bashing is a bit ""Old"" and ""Tired""","To start off I'm a Minister of the Lord - A Christian. I did read Anton's ""Satanic Bible"". I found it an interesting read, and read it so I could be a little more informed. To start with Man thrives on Hypocrisy - whether you are a Christian or Satanist. I didn't find Anton totally off base, and he had a few interesting points. ""Choice"" is an original gift from the Lord - He is the first one to say that a person can decide what it is they want to do. Satan didn't invent that. Most people like Satan and his works more than they would like to admit - some would argue to the death that it just isn't so. Satan has a way of shedding light on things mostly to a person's ultimate dismay. I would recommend that Christians inform themselves - The ""Church of Satan"" is a recognized religion in the United States. This book is worth a look at, and to have it in a religious study library. The Lord ""Loved"" us enough to let us go our own way. 2Timothy 3:1-5"
5,VALID SCRIBE,Anyone who is truly intelligent will see oceans of validity in the work of this genius. GOD IS VOID!
3,Good for what it is,"Good book, but too self-indulgent for my taste. I give it three just for the unique read and interesting view points, but I couldn't live this way. For a more balanced view of satanism, check out geocities.com/church_of_the_fallen666After all, at some point in our lives, we are all weak, so should we be taken advantage of???"
3,"This book is the way to go about life, MOSTLY.","I am so tired of people saying that you should live your life as to the Holy Bible. This book has opened my eyes to the true way of life, no matter how much say you should live life one way I still believe this is the true way to go."
4,Good book,"The Satanic Bible was written in 1969 and so isn't totally up to date on certain things. The rituals in it are only an outline, and most Satanist write their own these days. The Enochian keys are a waste of paper to me, I never use them. But, the key part of the book, the most importan part, are The Book Of Lucifer (part 2) and The Book Of Belial (part 3) as these are the parts that truly describe what Satanism is. The rest is basically page filler. Those 2 parts of the book aren't very long, but when I first read them, I relialized who I was and it changed my way of seeing the world forever. R.I.P. Anton Szandor LaVey, the evil mourn your passing."
5,This book is great if you are a atheist.,The Satanic Bible is great if you don't beleive in the Christian Faith. The book tells all about the fundamentals of life and how if you do beleive in Satan; how you can get started. In my opinion this book will surely make you see things in away that you have never seen them before.
1,Tragic.,"I don't understand how anyone would look away from Earth's beauty and unto the depths of hell. Yes, hell lies within. But so does heaven. Rid yourself of one-sidedness and look at every aspect of life and death...and then maybe you will achieve something worthwile within your time on earth."
1,Interesting . . .,"I find it interesting that you only print those review complimentary to this book and few if any that are critical. I and others have written our unbiased, objective reviews of this piece of self indulgence and after two weeks none of those reviews have appeared on-line."
1,Don't have any sense,"I'm a pesquisator, and this book don't have any sense because he wants to turn satanism on humanism( there is a point on the two things(the wish of freedom(specially from God)). The format and the paper quality is very poor. If you buy you will regret as I am."
3,Book,"This book was bought by my son, who is intrigued with different religions & their beliefs. This helped him see what else is being practiced out there."
3,Silly book,"Lavey, takes common sense and makes a world religion out of it. The princples he calls Satanism should be called just plain selfish. A human religion. There is little spiritual value or magical value in this work. Don't get me wrong I love the Lavey attitude. The man was brillant. Despite the fact that he once filed bankruptcy he finally learned how to market a simple concept, religion. People that are sick of Christinanity but hunger for ritual will eat his concept for religion up. I have done the rituals in this book and the ones in ""The Satanic Ritals"" for years they are fun to do with the right people. But you are not going to find enlightenment or magical properties herein. The rituals may generate enough energy to bring wishes true, but doubtful. And the politics of the Church of Satan should be enough to stir you away. Read the book it is a fun read. But if you are working a true magical path it may bring you down it does have a bit of darkness about it."
4,"Good Book, Recycled ideas","I'm not gonna knock the book, i respect Levay and it is an alright read for people just realizing that they've been lied to for so long. However, if you buy this and do find some credibility to what he's saying i suggest ""the Virtues Of Selfishness"" by Ayn Rand or Geneology of Morals by Neitzsche, hell any existentialist book would do these ideas more justice. There are a lot of good points, but the word choice is to scare religionists (i.e Satan, Magic, Rituals, etc) Look into Objectivism and individualism rather than just obeying levay instead of priests.Cheers"
2,Too much gibberish,"The first third of the book (the philosophy part) is interesting, although there's nothing new or original there, but it's good reading nonetheless. From there on, it's a lot of adolescent-appealing-terror-inducing rituals and gibberish in an ""ancient magic language"" called Enochian, in the very tradition of the dark magic scripts of Eliphas Levi and the like. If you like this kind of discourse, go for it, but if you are a rationalist like me, that's probably not for you."
3,hard to rate,"the first half was very interesting and insightful.i understood how we should embrace our human nature, blah blahBUT HERE is why gave it a 3 and kind of want you to buy and read and kind of fo notthe ENTIRE SECOND HALF was complete mumbo jumbo, for people who do not believe in an anthropomorphic diety they sure to believe in rituals a lot, i am not a Satanist, i was more philosophy for me, i related to a little bit but the second half was hog wash. I like Anton Levay a lot as a person and he is very bright but his book lost A LOT of legitimacy due to the TERRIBLE second half, i was very disappointed."
3,"Good, to a point","Well, I basically agree with nightferret's review and criticisms. However, I am not an atheist and I do believe in the need for spirituality, and I certainly don't think that all religions are bad. But I do, however agree with LaVeys' scathing social criticism. If nothing else, ""The Satanic Bible"" offers insight into our culture's hypocrisy. LaVeys' use of Freudianism, however,is questionable. Reading a lot of books on a subject doesn't make you a psychologist. LaVey was, perhaps, a very intelligent, articulate man, but he cannot honestly make to grandiose claim of knowing what ""human nature"" is. This book is a good observational view of society, often darkly humorous, but shouldn't really be taken as the cornerstone of a relgious movement."
2,Overrated Book,"My conception of this book is ""Satan Sells"". It is just a packaged commodity with ""Satan"" stamped on it so as to appeal to the person looking for meaning in his meaningless life. This book is just another American commodity; its whole purpose is to create a false sense of superiority in the reader; that of wanting to 'belong' to an elite (the Satanists). The book as usual relies on the doctrine of the 'other' (the hypocritical Xtian who is suffering from spriritual pipe dreams) in order to create the much needed adversary of Satan (the Adversary).I remember when I first read this book. I remember how agreeable it was. I have learned to be weary of books you agree too much with."
4,"Duh. Open your eyes, people.","Jeez, people. Open your eyes. Satanism teaches you to believe in yourself. You all need to check out the 9 Deadly Sins of Satanism, and the 11 Commandments of Satanism.Regardless, this book was fairly decent. It wasn't as good as I had hoped it to be. But for those who would like a good read, or are interested in Satanism in the least (perhaps it has piqued your interest), or just something to read for the sake of reading, pick this book up. You won't regret it."
5,Good wake up call-!,"It's imposible to run away from sin. We commit sin everyday of our lives. Even the Christian Church sins by being hypocritical. But, from what I've learn from the book is that you should just be content with who you are. I feel that Jesus will forgive you in the end. No matter how many sins you commit. God created us to be imperfect so that when the day come that we die we know that it is impossible to reach salvation without him. I would concider this book nothing more than a wake call for those Christians who think they don't commit as many sins as they think they commit."
5,Satanic Bible,"Anton Lavey has definitely ""turned the coin over."" It's ironic but I'm a recovering alcoholic (and doing better than ever) and practicing a philosophy that advocates indulgence not abstinance is actually keeping me on the correct path. I live in a transitional living house with roughly 10 other people, and many of them come from the so called best programs in the country armed with thier contrived altruistic ways praising ""God"" and ultimately fall off the wagon. Meanwhile, I take responsibility for myself by myself. ""I am my own redeemer."" and staying clean and comfortably so just as I should.I highly recomend Dr. Lavey's work to anyone searching for an alternative to the coventional religeons of today. If you have the courage, step in and try it out. You might just surprise yourself."
4,The Way of the Flesh,"Dr. Anton Szandor LaVey was the first to codify Satanism into an applicable religion, and this book marks down the basic formula and doctrines that such a religion offers. Satanism is best defined as the glorification of the material world through the indulgence of carnal desires. ""Satan"" is by no means a literal being, he is more of a personification of the natural (and dark) powers of nature, and the universe.This book is logical, concise, and its rationality will astound many. It is the bible of realism and Undefiled Wisdom. There are no false and fraudulant ritualistic creeds to be found here, all are based on what is experienced in this world, and what has proven successful. Welcome to Darwin's Inferno!"
2,"Yeah, OK, Whatever","Let me first start out by saying for the record that I am a Satanist. I became interested in Satanism through the Satanic Bible, and at the time I read it, this book impressed me. However, the reason I give it two stars is that half the book is common sense that everyone should know already. The other half is just (...) made-up languages and silly theatrics disguised as powerful rituals.There is so much healthy and vital about Satanism, and while this book may be a good primer for it, it should NEVER be treated as a ""Bible,"" only as an introduction, and one opinion out of many."
3,a good read,"I liked the book because it's ""logical"", but it's not open minded enough for me. Worth reading yes! it's interesting, I heard about what it was like from a friend and read it just out of interest. I don't want to say too much, make your own conclusions on this book. I'm not making any."
3,doesn't do much for me,"Nothing wrong with this product, and I know it is loved by many. The truth is, though, that when I use it, I don't get much of a sensation other then that of a cold water splash. I prefer a non-alcoholic after shave balm (check out prorasa pre-post).I am sure this stuff is great if you are a witch hazel fan, I just don't perceive the benefits for myself. I still have an almost full bottle, and I will use it up, so if my opinion changes, I'll edit this in the future."
1,bad!!!,"When I received my package, I opened it and found there is no protective materials in the box!! The bottle cap is broken and some of the liquids has come out!! so terrible."
1,Container leaks. Lost everything.,The container lid leaks. I hadn't even opened it yet and everything leaked out of the seal on the lid. Boo. I was really looking forward to using this stuff.
2,Not for me,"I will finish off what I have because this product does refresh and it does not contain alcohol. However, it does not smell good. My husband always prods what product he's smelling -- and not in a good way. I myself don't care for it. Also, it hasn't done anything to help clear up my skin or heal the acne I do have. I know my acne is hormone related since I just had a baby and am nursing, but this still has done nothing to help. I will not buy this again. I will go back to using Neutrogena's alcohol free toner. It smells so much better and works just as good as a toner."
3,I actually prefer the Rose scented version of this product,"But to add that I do like this one, it is just that I can't use it often. I suspect that it is the lavender it contains. Even in the thick of the summer heat and humidity, when I use it straight for a week, my skin develops dry and rough patches, and I have extremely oily skin. So at times, I use it when my oily skin becomes too much to handle. If your skin can tolerate lavender and have oily skin, this is a good choice. I also detest that the bottle is not travel friendly once you open the bottle. It leaks like crazy."
5,Cloth Diapering Win.,"I bought this product for use as a diaper wipe solution. I love it. It smells good, which is pleasant when changing a poopy diaper. It also works well and doesn't irritate my daughters skin, which is a MUST. I also used the cucumber scent, but it just made me hungry whenever I smelled it... not something I wish to associate with diaper changing. I not only would buy again, I have bought several times. Definitely worth it!"
5,Charming story with wonderful language,"My son brought this book home from kindergarten for me to read. I love the way it's written and plan to buy it as a gift. Even on the first reading, the words really flow off the tongue and it's a blast to read out loud. The story itself is charming and quite silly. Why would a grandmother put a cow in a child's bed to help him sleep? This is a typical story format for young children, basically repetitive with new items added each time. The repetitive style is naturally good for children around age 3, while the illustrations,zany nature of the story and the acceleration of reading speed enchant older children. The text invites plenty of sound effects for those who get dramatic while reading out loud. This is one of those stories your child may want every night -have fun!"
5,"Thank You Gena, Press and Brent","I have purchased 7 books so far, and will be buying more. I have given this book to teachers, friends, family and even the therapists....My son Richie is 8. I have already been through an emotional roller coaster....and I am thankful to have a book to support what I try to explain.... My son is struggling day to day but it's nice to know that we are not alone. I only wish I could meet you all. You are all an inspiration to us, my sons, my husband, my mom.....I just want to thank you.....Linda (a mom)"
5,A love story you must read!!,"Reading this intriguing story of the love between Jake and Samantha, I found it difficult to believe this was Donna Laird's first novel. This blooming new author managed to create genuine characters with lifelike situations that relate to most of us in one way or another. FOREVER YOURS is a book of family ties, personal success, and most of all, the true test of love between a man and a woman. After many tribulations of their relationship that will keep the reader turning pages, Jake and Samantha find their way to each other as this book leaves the reader with a feeling of contentment. Any reader of romances will surely appreciate Donna Laird's debut novel, FOREVER YOURS. I, for one, will be looking for more to come from this author."
2,"Awful, simply awful.","The DVD box makes you think this is a movie about Delta Force against ressurected ghost warriors. In reality its about a bunch of overweight, out of shape ex-commandos running around with machine guns killing the same half a dozen stunt men over and over. The 'Ancient Warriors' of the title appear in the last 30 seconds of the movie. All they do is fade in, look mean and fade out again. Don't even waste money renting this one."
1,Not Happy,"I was VERY disappointed upon receiving this cd. I thought it was a karaoke cd. Party Tyme is a major label for making karaoke cd's, and I guess I just didn't read the add thoroughly enough before ordering. Anyway, DON'T make the same mistake I did and assume it's a karaoke cd, cuz it's not. I hope somebody out there is more happy w/ this cd then I was."
5,Great case,This case is neat and a perfect fit. It make my scratched up blackberry pearl look like new
5,Excellent case for blackberry pearl 8100.,It fits snugly and provides good grip. It looks much better than in photos. Best case for carrying 8100 in pockets or hand bags.
2,Doesn't fit my phone,I have a Pearl 8100 but the openings in this skin case (for the buttons along the sides and top) don't align with my phone's buttons and ports. In some cases they are slightly off and in others they are completely off. Very annoying.
4,"fine, but a little loose","This works just fine, but would be better if the fit was a little more snug. It also attracts lint like velcro!"
3,Decent Product,"The product does a nice job of giving the Blackberry some protection. I've had mine about month now and it is still in good shape. However, it does attract and hold dust and lint more than I would like, making the phone look dirty. It's also harder to pull the phone out of my pocket as the silicone tends to grip onto the fabric."
5,"Awesome product, and price","i bought this because i have the tendency to drop my phone a lot. and since i had broken the battery cover i needed something that could hold the cover in place. so i found this product for a very low price, when i recieved it was really soft and not sticky. overall great product."
4,can't really complain at this price huh?,"This skin fits well and looks good. The jacks are all easily accessible through the cutouts which line up perfectly. It lacks a screen protector which would have been a welcomed addition. The volume keys are a little difficult to access due to them being recessed when the skin is on. It takes a little getting used to, but ultimately isn't a big deal. The one thing that has been fairly bothersome is the feel of the skin. It always feels slippery to me. I rated it at four starts though because it definitely serves it's purpose well and for the couple of dollars that it costs, it's pretty hard to complain about it."
2,Not as great as it looks!,"I bought this when I bought my blackberry as it looked really cool! It fits good to device and even with this, blackberry looks really good. Only problem is that it is made of rubber and so, difficult to insert in pocket and get it out of pocket and it is misarable with jeans as it has straight pocket! Also it picks up the lints and becomes dirty right away.. I would rather prefer a plastic one. Well, since I bought my phone I dropped it twice, and nothing happened because of this rubber (silicone???) skin case!!"
5,works as intended,protects the phone from scratched due to falls. fits great and does not come off easily. Slim fitment so its does not bulk up your phone
3,"Fits phone, but does not align with buttons","I have a Pearl 8100, but the openings don't align with my phone's buttons. The camera is non-existent for taking pictures unless I take the skin off. I like the protection, but not the accessability."
3,Teenage idols,"I am sorry I have to give just 3 out of 5 points for this album. It is of course of todays standards. They were and are my heroes and I was overwhelmed at the sound and technic on their there latest album, Still on tour! It is like night and day!They were the greatest then, but technology has changed so much. The tracks are wonderful, but the sound is pretty primitive compared to today.But we still want to have this in our collection, because this was the way they/we were! JUNE in Sweden"
3,An absolute must,This album is an absolute must for all of you who've been expecting something good over the years. I keep listening it and it reminds me of those good times when there was only good music and trash was trash. Nowadays we have only trash and good recording techniques that permit bad artist sell and earn promoting their trash around the world and making bad music even worse. Let the good music rolls again.cheers.
5,a book you can't live without,"The Celestial Fortune Cookie is like having a little special treat everyday--a cookie without calories! The quotes for your sign each day give you nutritious and delicious food for thought so that you can approach each day a little wiser. If you love quote books, this is also a great book for you, because Ms. Valeria has culled thousands of quotes from hundreds of sources--some of them humorous, some of them wise, some obscure--but all of them appropriate to your sign (or the sign of a friend/loved one/colleague, etc.) so you have some personal guidance every day. Whether or not you believe in astrology, having a quote presented to you each day for meditation or contemplation is a gift you shouldn't deny yourself."
5,Are you trapped in Hell? Read this book,"This Book, ""Escape Routes"" is so profound that you will not be able to put it down. These are stories about people like you and me that are trapped in today's Hell. But do not give up there is hope for all who read this book. Just think that there are many people out there that have the same struggles. Arnold makes it clear that not all have found there way out of Hell but we need to keep looking for our own Escape Route."
2,Only if you are Christian,This books reads like an advertisment that following Christianity will be a cure all for everyone. I took it back to the library after flipping through it and realizing this
5,Four Men Hanging,"First, for the politically correct, this book concerns white men lynched by white men in an Oklahoma town that had been Indian Territory a very few years earlier.The Wild West ended in Oklahoma in the early 1900's, not Tombstone's OK Corral in the 1880's. This eyewitness author reminds us what American justice means and how it's carried out when ""the system"" repeatedly and horribly fails. Simply put, when law and order systematically fail, evil people will exploit the failure...but the armed general public cannot be easily bribed, and they surely tend to relentlessly hunt down human monsters when no ""legal"" option exists. This primal justice is a warning to criminals of all classes in our times as well as in theirs, a mere century ago."
3,contemporary suspense but low on romance,"I remember reading this book several years ago. I was looking for romantic suspense and what I read was a contemporary suspense book that was low on romance.Jan Garret's sister was killed years before. She went on to become an assistant state's attorney. The reader is fed bits and pieces of what the serial killer is thinking. Jan sets herself up as a decoy while working with Max, a new detective on the local force. Between her baggage and the doubts that he is carrying I was amazed that there was any romance at all. There is murder and mayhem but I was neither scared nor glued to the pages.Margaret Allison has potential and I'd be willing to try something else that she has written. I am sorry to say that this book was alright for an afternoon if you have nothing else to do."
4,Name the Baby,"Good base, old and missing some names but I liked some of the unique names. I liked it a lot."
3,It's OK,"I'm not sure what to make of some of the reviews. I paid very little for this book so I was willing to take a chance. I figured out of 25,000 names we could find something that would appeal to us. I think it is a useful name book. It is true that they have a variety of names from very different origins i.e African, Japanese, Hebrew, Greek, etc. However, in our case we weren't looking for a book that would give us Amy, Jenny, Bob, Jack and James. We are familiar with those common names already. So for us it will do the job. True, there are some names in here that I can't believe anyone would ever name their kid but I think that I could say that for any name book. If you are looking for a common name then there probably are better books out there. If you want a name that is a little more unique then you will probably be satisfied."
1,Don't trust her foreign names!!,"I can't believe she has actually published this book without doing more research! Almost all the Japanese names listed there are useless - I would feel sorry for your child. If she is so inaccuarte with Japanese names, I wouldn't trust any of other foreign names listed there. The author should be more responsible if she was going to publish something. Do more research, please!"
1,Buyer beware!,"I'm a Japanese national, and as far as Japanese names are concerned, most of the author's picks in this book are seldom correct. And when they are correct, they are obscure. I saw a lot of crazy ones that cannot be names, and the meanings are often nonsensical. This makes me sucpicious about the credibility of other names from other cultures."
1,Worthless,"Maybe one out of every 100 names in this book is a name I've heard of. There must be over 20,000 of the 25,000 names that are Hindu, Arabic, Hebrew, African, Thai, or Czech. The first 10 girls' names listed are Aaliyah, Aanandini, Aba, Ababuo, Abagbe, Abam, Abayomi, Abebi, Abedabun, and Abegaila. Abagbe???!!!If you're looking for a simple book of names to peruse, this is not the one for you."
3,A good place to start,"An appealing book with an attractive lay-out and fairly comprehensive coverage of names from many cultural sources. Not always accurate as to the meaning and/or origin of names: readers wanting more depth might want to consult some of the other excellent books available. However, this is a good place to start and includes lots of interesting suggestions on how to go about selecting a name for the new family member."
1,Hated this offensive author,"Name explanations include personal opinions from the author that are totally offensive, like describing certain names as ""too ethnic"" or ""too Hispanic."" What is that supposed to mean? Actually, I know exactly what it means, and I was flabbergasted that such ignorant nonsense was included in such a mainstream series as ""The Everything..."" books. I guess this book's audience is intended to be Anglo American or those who want to be more Anglo, which is curious since the list includes many African American and Arabic names. I paid 50 cents for a used copy of this book, and this Pilipina-American naming a Pilipina/Latina-American daughter wants her money back."
4,Expecting 2002,"My husband and I are expecting our first child soon and are looking for names. This book has a every name you can think of including some unusual names. We really like the book format and are still considering a few names, but this was a fun way to think up new names and consider them for our son. If you are looking for a name with a certain ethnic background this book has almost all the different cultures covered. Covered every name from A to Z. Just like the title says."
4,There words not ours,"It is often more interesting to read what those who have been there have to say than what we think they said. Thus is the case with this book. It may not have every fact correct, but it is what the author McClellen remembered. As with ""Co. Aych"" and ""All For the Union,"" their perception of the smaller picture of the War than the overall history that is fascinating."
5,McClellan's Book is the Best,This has to be one of the best. I should have read this one first. All other books on Stuart are based on this book.
1,Hand Held CB Radio,The product did NOT live up to my expectations in any fashion. I tried two different antennas one provided with the radio (small rubber whip shorty) and the Cobra HG A 1500 Base-Load Medium Magnet Mount 300W CB Antenna. The reception with either of these was terrible. I tried monitoring via scan all channels and got no reception anywhere. I had to return this radio and forget about CB monitoring for the time being. Bad experience.
4,"works great, but......","This handheld CB works great on all channels, but only for short range. The external antenna helps a lot when traveling by car. All in all a good buy for the money."
1,Waste of $$,I thought this would be fun for my daughters on our freeway road trips. We couldn't even get one reception with trucks passing us in the next lane. Total waste of $$.
3,Noisy,"Cobra Road Trip handheld CB, purchased to replace an older Road Trip unit that failed, noisier than the old unit, as tested weekly in an emergency preparedness drill, using a portable emergency auto battery for power. Transmit function better than receive function, same as in the replaced unit. New unit overall about fourth best of 7 CB units I have used since the mid '50s. GMRS service in which I am licensed might be better."
4,A solid Product,"The main use for my hand held is to communicate with other cars on long road trips. This hand held was very versatile when it came to communicating in short range. If the distance exceeded more that half a mile I lost communication. All this occurred with both the antennas provided, but was solved when I purchased a long range antenna. After that long and short range communication went smoothly. Overall a good product to own due to that its portable(no need for installation), small, and very versatile. I recommend it."
1,Cobra HH Hand Held Cb is a HORRIBLE WASTE OF $ !!!,"If you want it for weather, great; but if you want it for transmitting for CB purposes, don't bother. i bought 2 and what a waste! They can only transmit well up to 600 feet, and tops out at 1/2 mile. If you live in town, that may not matter to you, but if you're in the country at all, it won't make it. Find a longer range unit cause this one is NOT it! i used a car model in my home with a antena on our TV tower that worked great for years. But this i repeat is a waste of $ for a CB! Sorry, but i must speak the truth, wish i could get a refund!"
5,Survival kit necessity!,"When a natural disaster strikes, cell phones and land lines can not do what this can. With the easy portability, this cb radio can get you in contact with emergency services and loved ones who also have one and are within range. Even if the person you are trying to contact is out of range, someone on one of the 40+ channels would probably be able to relay information. It also has a signal booster and the sound comes in loud and clear. I bought one for me and one for my wife. If the event of an earthquake, we each will turn our radios on to a specified channel and instantly contact each other.And, as previously mentioned, even if we are out of range of each other, we will be able to contact emergency services. Possible real life-saver!"
2,"garbage, unless you just want to monitor other cber's convos","I can't believe people are giving this thing a good review. They are either technical geniuses, and have modified the unit, or are Cobra employees.I bought three of these, used the magnet external antenna, and all three produced a 3/10 of mile line of sight transmission range. Motorola ""talk-about"" radios work better than this, and with no external mount.The only thing this is good for is monitoring truckers while driving.The 'sound tracker' is a joke... just a fancy equalization adjustment.Looking into a permanent under dash unit instead."
1,"Performance, Zero","The description and spec's indicate this radio should work, even if you are expecting less performance than a full sized radio. I experienced zero reception in hand held mode, and practically no reception in my vehicle using the mobile antenna supplied. I then attached a tuned, four foot Wilson antenna. Still no reception. I did pick up one or two words of a couple of transmissions, and actually had a two sentenance conversation with a vehicle fifty feet ahead of me. My report is based on a 1200 mile, one week trip, all types of traffic situations. Half a star from my experience. Save you money on this one. Gary Q."
2,buttons failed after a couple months,"This unit worked well for what it is; a handheld CB. I was able to transmit and receive greater distances than I expected (over a mile) and the sound quality is okay. After 3 months, however, the buttons on the side of the unit for changing channels no longer work at all. I can get to ch9 and ch19 with the instant ch9/19 button on the front of the unit, but the only way to get so a different channel is to scan and hope it stops when someone is talking. I am very disappointed with Cobra customer service as I was told I am basically SOL since the limited warranty is rather limited.In sum, I am now debating between getting another HHROADTRIP like this radio and hoping the buttons remain functions or trying a Midland radio."
5,Cobra quality!!,I had a WX38 this unit replaces it. Had it for 4 years and it took tons of punishment. This unit works well and I use it for work ( talking to trucks delivering materials ) in my car and at home. Clean sound and when hooked up to base antenna works as good as a base unit. Portable antennas work good for their size remember they are for quick close communications. If you want distance buy the adaptor and use full antenna or the full size portable whip
2,POOR DISTANT TRANSM ITION,"JUNE 04,2006I PURCHASED THIS RADIO FOR EMERGENCY PURPOSES, HOWEVER IT SEEMS TO BE VERY WEEK. I AM A DOUBLE AMPUTEE AND AM CONFINED TO A WHEEL CHAIR. I DEPEND ON MY RADIO TO RAISE HELP. BUT, I AM AFRAID THIS ONE WILL NOT BE DEPENDABLE. I AM NOT ASKING FOR THEM TO BE RETURNED OR FOR A REFUND JUST LETTING YOU AND YOUR CUSTOMERS KNOW OF A VERY WEAK PRODUCT AND I COULD NOT RECCOMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE. COBRA WAS THE TOPS IN RADIOS BUT SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED TO THE QUALITY.THANK YOU FOR LISTENING;WILLIAM HEMBREEWmHembree@aol.com"
2,Not so pleased with the Cobra Road Trip Hand Held CB Radio,"I tested the Cobra hand held CB on California Rt. 99 today. Not so good. Tuned into truckers' channel 17 (for North-South traffic) and heard mostly noise. There was very little discernible language so I squelched out the noise and waited...and waited. I called out for a radio check and got a comeback--loud but not clear. The speaker in that hand held CB is awful. It's abrasive to listen to.It is my opinion that the short 10 inch magnetic roof antenna is ineffective in receiving clear signals and if you do get a clear nearby signal it is unlistenable because of the poor quality of the speaker.This CB radio needs some work to make it worth using on the road. Perhaps a longer whip antenna in the roof mount along with a better quality extension speaker will make the system less annoying. I was looking for a portable system for temporary use, but the Cobra HH Road Trip CB is pretty poor. Personally, I wouldn't buy it again."
2,not something I would recommend,This is not a good cb the engine noise sucks and I can only hear one side of a conversation and only if that is the next block over. However I did try a better antenna and it worked a little better still only one sided I think it's only good for the wifes car if she is following you someplace with no cell service.
1,Not happy!,"We purchased for traveling between our summer and winter homes twice a year. Firstly we found that it had no range on the interstate. Wanted to get road reports and couldn't reach anyone further than a 1/2 mile away.......too late! Secondly, it doesn't work anymore. It appears to have short or something. It has never been dropped or misused. It was working in the car one day and the next it would not. Very disappointed."
3,Cobra HHRoadTrip 40 Channel CB Radio,I want to be fair with those involved in selling the item. I guess my expectations were too high. Even with an outside antenna the reception is not good even when you are beside someone broadcasting on a CB. If I were to choose another CB I would not purchase a handheld.
4,save this for a rainy day,"I say that because the songs on the disc are quite dark, moody and mysterious. The majority of the tracks here are slow and full of deep dark electronics and droning strings. The first two tracks, however, are a bit more upbeat and dancy. One quick glance at the English translations in the bokklet is enough to make your stomach churn in anquish at human misery and cruelty. The songs are sad, full of deceit and murder but do try to offer some kind of moral lesson. Emma sings with a gutteral precision placing a strong emphasis with certain words and phrases so the Swedish lyrics don't sound as smooth as Danish contemporaries Sorten Muld. Herr Holkin is my favorite track although Vengence and Halling Jaron do come in closely behind it."
5,Excellent Resource,"As a new pastor, I was looking for a book that I could use in creating the liturgy for services when a fellow-pastor shared his copy of this book with me. It has multiple prayers and responsive readings for ALL aspects of a worship service, from A-Z and is well-organized and easy to follow.After one glance, I was hooked and had to have my own copy.Addition - May 2009 - I have now been using the Worship Sourcebook for four years. I have found many other resources, but keep this one at the very top of my list for preparing worship services. It is one of the books I would never be without."
4,Wonderful Performance!,"This is CD2 of a 2CD-single set of Jessica's Smash hit no.3 ""I wanna love you forever""...... Can you think of a madien with a high vocal performance like the diva Mariah Carey years ago? In this single, you can listen to the album version and two other great remixes: soda club radio mix is an engergetic mix with dance tempo to cheer you up and make you happy;soul solution radio mix is an amazing mix to combine together with geart electronical instrumental and background vocal. Two different remixes are hard to find in US release, so get your copy soon! In addition, a free limited edition poster with lyrics is a collectible just for you, a super Jessica fan! Must get!"
3,Brownout,"I recently purchased 3 items on Amazon.com. Out of the 3,2 are still now working right.The Dekcell ATAPI/IDE adapter power unit,which has 2 separate voltage outlets,one for 5V,and one for 12V,stopped functioning about 2 hours after being plugged in.It was returned to Brilliant Store for a replacement on 01/02/2011. Today is 01/17/2011,I hope to receive it shortly."
4,Dekcel USB - HD adaptor---not too bad,"Was very easy to install and use on my laptop's 2.5 inch drive. I had to remove the special plastic guard/pin adaptor on the drive, but that was easy. I have not yet been successful in getting my 3.5 inch HD to read however. The drive itself may be faulty, but I think that there is just not enough power supplied to the motor. The HD is old, so I don't entirely blame the Dekcel adaptor. Overall, worth the money so far."
4,This is The Army,"I found the movie had some glitches in it, but otherwise it wasn't to bad. It was classified as new, but think it was taped from another tape. Maybe the other tape had some glitches in it."
3,Poor quality recording,"The movie itself is enjoyable but the picture and sound quality is less than desirable. It also has tracking problems. I tried it on two different machines and it wouldn't track out completely on either one.The lack of desirable picture and sound quality, as well as the tracking problems, are probably due to it having been copied at the EP speed instead of the SP speed as it should have been.I am very upset about the condition of this recording and I wouldn't buy another recording, tape or disk, put out by this particular company."
5,Good Movie,"I am a big fan of older movies and have a lot in my collection. I bought this movie because I liked Reagan's acting. From the first time I watched it, I fell in love with the movie. It is excellent. If you don't enjoy musicals, though, you may not like this one. The sacrifice of our soldiers and their families is shown to an extent. I do think the movie could touch on that subject a bit more. The music is great and the dancing is enjoyable. The patriotic theme is very refreshing also. I would recommend this movie to anyone."
4,Sort of Prophetic In a Way,"This is a war genre movie, but with a ""feel good"" comedic positive flavor. It's filled with Irvin Berlin music and dance numbers. Quite literally much of it is a ""Hollywood Production"" in terms of big bands and choruses of entertainers.Both WWI and WWII are included. There's a retro segment where they pay tribute to the First World War near the end of the film, but earlier there's a WWI segment as well. A lot of patriotic themes are found. Kate Smith's ""God Bless America"" is like a 1040s music video in that as she sings, there are scenes of various American settings.Ronald Reagan and his fellow soldiers get excited about the possibility of performing for the President of the United States. There's even a playing of ""Hail to the Chief!"" Now how about that for history's seeds being planted in a symbolic way? Ifind one strange thing, there is too many scenes of men dressed as women. Generally there's an upbeat tone throughout the whole film."
2,You get what you pay for.,"Though this is a classic musical, this release is a rip off. The quality is what you'd expect a pirated copy would be. The video is faded, scratched up and dirty. The audio is almost nonexistant. I had my surround system up to 60% just to hear it and was blasted at the end.Save your money on this pig in a poke."
2,This is the Army,"""This is the Army"" is a wonderful, patriotic film full of Irving Berlin's music, made in 1943. The scene with Kate Smith singing ""God Bless America"" is worth the price, alone. However, the picture-quality is well below average. A digitally-restored quality was expected."
1,disapointed first time video buyer,"Bought ""This Is The Army"" movie. The reason I bought this video and was looking forward to viewing it was because I saw this movie last memorial day on TV. Even though it was made in 1941, the TV version was very clear and audio was clear as well. However, the video I received was so blurred and dark, it looked as though it was re-recorded over and over and over again. It was not pleasant to watch at all. I will hesitate to share it with my friends. I would be very cautious in purchasing further videos in the future. David South, Braselton, GA.."
4,A souvenir from the World War II with Ronald Reagan,"Do you remember that Ronald Reagan was an actor before being President of the United States or the voice and image of General Electric. That is true. it is a movie in which Ronal Reagan plys one of the main character. It is also a souvenir of World War I and World War II, a souvenir about the shows to sustain the moral of the soldiers, a souvenir about the army of your father and your grandfather. The movie has succeeded to pass through time but obviously, it is a 60 years old movie that has lost a little bit of its colors. The sound is not perfect but it was a great show. So, why not buying it? It is different and it shows how America supports its soldiers, sailors and aviators."
5,A good copy,I had a VHS version of this movie. My wife wanted to replace it with a DVD since she said the tape was deteriorating. As mentioned in other reviews this film is public property and the quality of the reproductions is not consistent. This Warner Brothers version meets her expectations. Comments by Amazon sellers indicate it is in limited supply so if you want a copy I suggest you buy one soon. I have no connection with any seller.
1,DON'T BUY IT,"The quality of the picture and the sound on this DVD gets in the way right from the get go. The picture is fuzzy at best. The colors are washed out and the sound is terrible.If you want to keep it because it supported the war effor, then keep it.If you want to keep it because you enjoy President's Reagan's Movies, then keep it. (I own two:Desperate Journey and Santa Fe)If you want to keep it (there are several different graphic versions of the movie) then keep it. I bought two, they were cheap!But, again I say, the poor quality of picture will get in the way. When you go past it in your collection of DVD's, you will do just that, go right on past it and watch something else of his."
3,"Fantastic Historical Piece, Very Poor Sound Quality","I purchased this CD for my 78 year-old father, who first saw this show live in London in 1944 before he jumped into Normandy with the 101st Airborne. He was amazed at how quickly this CD was located and purchased online. However, the recording is so poor that he cannot decipher the lyrics. Bravo for having it in your warehouses, though."
1,Sound quality made it unlistenable.,"I certainly did not hate the material for which I ordered this film, but the disc was soooo ""over copied"" (or whatever the term is) that I cannot even hear Irving Berlin sing ""Oh How I Hate to get Up in the Morning."" I have seen this film at other venues and in other circumstances and those viewings were definitely not in this kind of unlistenable shape. (the video aspect was also equally as ""ghostly."")Again, the film itself is what I wanted, but the condition is unusable.For whatever it's worth, I have never had this problem before with Amazon, so I will continue to buy from Amazon unless this happens again.The shipping was prompt."
4,Pretty good low-cost phone,"I was happy to find this phone. The quality of low-cost corded phones these days is generally very poor. I have higher-end Panasonic phones and I think this one does just fine in terms of sound quality. What other reviewers have said about there not being a large enough indent on the handset for hanging on a wall is mostly correct. I have ours on a wall and the handset does remain in place, but it is a precarious perch. Otherwise, this is probably one of the best low-budget, low-frills phones available."
4,Simple and useful,"bought for a simple instrument and it is that. It is modular, can use longer cords for hand set and base (which I already have on hand). It is very user friendly"
4,Works Fine,"A decent office-style phone for the price. Works fine and apparently has decent sound quality. I have to admit, the phone - particularly the handset - seems flimsy, but that may be a factor of modern production and price consideration. My last phone lasted 15 years - I doubt this one will do as well."
4,Does what its suppose to do..,I bought it to connect my Headset at my home office... I just needed a simple phone with dial pad and redial capabilities...All is fine.. but i feel it is a bit costly for an online shopping.. Because basic Cordless phones are cheaper than these... for An older technology i expected $10 less that the price i paid... well thats just me...
4,"Does What It Says, for Way Cheap","Great little phone, so far. It works fine. Only problem is that the volume control distorts the signal somewhat, but for such a cheap price, I can't complain too much."
4,Basic reliable phone,This phone is easy to install and simple to use. It mated perfectly with the standard phone company-installed wall mount panel. Reception is clear. You do have to take some care in replacing the handset on the phone as the handset hook retainer is somewhat small.
4,Good Value In A Basic Amplified Phone,"We were needing a corded phone with adjustable volume for my aging (and hard of hearing) mother-in-law. This phone was just what we were looking for, and at a very attractive price. The ringer is loud enough that she can hear it, and the amplified receiver allows her to hear conversations better than before.The only negative I have noticed is the shortness and tight coil of the phone cord, combined with the phone's light weight, causes it to pull off the table easily. A longer cord would be nice (and necessary in this case). Overall, a good value."
4,simple but nice phone,"Phone is simple. No bells and whistles, but solid, easy to use, and you can't lose it. Works clearly."
3,No luster after 4 years,We had this flatware for 4 years and it still looks okay. But now we are buying new ones because it has lost its shine from all the washing. Can cut through steak but not so with ease unlike other brands. Lightweight and just right for everyday use but not for more formal dinings. For 18/0 this is okay for everyday. Simple but not elegant.
2,rust,One of the spoons rusted after 1 month of ownership. That is pretty pathetic. I though Oneida was supposed to be one of the best.
4,stagecoach,stagecoach is a classic and we enjoy having it as john wayne is one of our favorite actors. You can tell we are old
2,DVD Transfer is horrendous!!!,"My complaint is with Criterion's transfer, not with the movie. It looks as if Criterion just slopped the movie on a DVD and sold it at their usual high price. There are more lines and scratches than I've seen in a long, long time. Needless to say, I'm disappointed at Criterion's production. I'd expect this kind of ""work"" if it was selling for $8.99, but not at the price Criterion is selling it for. I cannot compare to the blu-ray only because I am too chicken to invest the money in another potential Criterion dud."
4,Great Western,"Product exceeds my expectations and arrived in a timely fashion. Very happy with both shipment and service, along with a great product. I highly recommend this to all customers for a future purchase. Very interesting to see The Duke really be enjoying himself in early movies."
3,I'm told this is a great film but I wouldn't know for myself.,"Yes I know it's a classic that was greater than all the Westerns that came before it. There was more moral ambiguity, the characters were probably more real than in most Westerns of the 1930s, and the scenery was breathtaking. I agree with all the commentary in this Criterion Collection edition that tells you how important this movie was. But I keep falling asleep when I watch it. I don't even know how the movie ends!I am determined to finish this film one day if only to say how great a contribution it made to the whole cowboy film genre."
4,The father of all westerns,"I watched this good movie, here in Brazil.The music is amazing,but this a ""normal"" western in this time, where a good indian was a dead indian.Art is art forever and this movie shows this fact."
5,An offbeat Western!,If the mythical term journey can be adapted in some Western picture is precisely in this undeniable giant story.The journey: a group of assorted passengers on a stage into Indian country; and the astonishing script and wonderful and incisive artistic scalpel of Ford about the several codes behavior allows us to explore a true micro cosmos in just 100 min.This was the film that threw to John Wayne to stardom.This film meant to the Western an absolute revaluation of the genre. And beware: that year the world was just in the threshold of the WW2.
5,Stagecoach,"This is an excellent old John Wayne feature film. One could argue that the quality could be better, but for an old B&W movie it is excellent. John Wayne appears larger than life and Clair Trevor and the rest of the cast are all excellent choices who complement the Duke admirably. This is a must have for all fans of Mr. Wayne."
5,Western Classic,"Apparently, Orson Welles watched Stagecoach over and over again before creating Citizen Kane. I can see why. The characterizations, the cinematography, plot construction, etc. are highly realized. I enjoy movies that make your imagination go to how you would react if you were in these movie situations yourself. That's what Stagecoach does - it puts you in the story. You feel like you're eavesdropping at times. Also, it helps to have John Wayne as the larger than life Ringo. Highly recommended for any Western purveyor. This took the Western into a new, richer era."
3,As Expected,"Item was required material for Native Americans In Film college course. Film clearly revealed negative and stereotypical Hollywood attitudes toward Native Americans, which have not changed much today. In addition, this film reveals sexist attitudes toward women. Pretty clear look at patriarchal and racist social structures that place white American males at the top of the food chain."
1,region 1 DVD,"It was impossible to review this item as the discs were for region 1, whereas I live in region 2. Please be careful when dispatching DVDs"
5,Masoud Mirmomeni,"It is one of the greatest movies in Western genre. Like other Ford's movies, the ending is great."
5,Stagecoach,"If you're looking at ordering Stagecoach, you probably don't need me to tell you that it's a great movie. Yes, it's in black and white. Yes, it's a little grainy. Yes, its on a square screen. That will keep the brats who don't like looking at a movie in black and white from seeing it. This is a movie for the more informed, the more enlightened.The movie itself is excellent and complete. It deserves its four stars. The commentary which accompanies the movie as a special feature is very, very well done. I watched the movie three times and listened to the commentary twice before I could put it into my collection. This is the first great, adult western. You will be pleased with your purchase."
4,Stagecoach,"Stagecoach is an excellent movie with the breakthrough of The Duke himself John Wayne, a definite must to watch and if you like a must have. A Classic."
5,Stagecoach,The movie is by all accounts a true classic. I am thrilled to have this DVD in my collection. The image quality of this B/W film is great.
4,Stagecoach- John Wayne,"Great western movie, although the cover is entirely in Korean. The condition of the movie was good. I'll use this seller again."
3,SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON,"SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON AND OTHER JOHN WAYNE MOVIES WERE ENJOYED BEFORE TODAY'S ""LIGHT SHOW"" MOVIES AND THE LANGUAGE WAS MORE CIVIL. THE MOVIES MAY APPEAR SIMPLE AND YOU MAY BE MISSING A LOT BECAUSE YOU EXPECT THEM TO BE SIMPLE. THEY WERE AWARD WINNERS IN THEIR HEYDAY. OTHERS, LIKESTAGECOACH, FORT APACHE AND RIO GRANDE ARE IN BLACK AND WHITE AND YOU MAYSKIP THEM FOR THAT REASON, BUT WHAT DO YOU MISS. THEY ARE AMERICANA ANDTHEY SHOW HUMAN INTEREST VALUE. CHECK OUT THE FINE POINTS. WAS THATREALLY A UFO CAUGHT ON CAMERA IN THE FILMING OF RIO GRANDE IN LATE 1940'S ? BY TODAY'S LIGHT SHOW STANDARDS YOU MAY NOT NOTICE THIS ""SOMETHING"" THAT WAS NOT PART OF THE MOVIE. HECK, YOU MAY NOT SEE IT. AS FOR THE RATING YOU APPLY TO ""SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON"", DO YOU DO IT BY COMPARISON TO MOVIES OF ITS DAY OR TO THE LIGHT SHOW MOVIES OF NOW ?JUST ENJOY IT."
5,A Landmark,"With this picture, John Ford took story and form from the B-western and raised it to the level of great filmmaking, a work of art. Ford's pioneering use of deep focus, his exceptional composition, the magnificent exterior sequences shot in Monument Valley, all make this a first-rate film and a tremendously influential work. The broader story, emblematic of the Western mythos, involves a desparate run for safety from Geronimo. Against that backdrop, the film uses character types to explore the relationships among the American classes. John Wayne is pure innocence as the Ringo Kid, surrounded by a group of top-notch players. Thomas Mitchell's performance as the drunken Doc Boone stands out particularly, for both sheer amusement and occasional glimpses of real greatness. This film is a delight to watch, for simple entertainment or for the richness of its cinematic artistry."
3,An over-priced film classic,"""Stagecoach"" is a classic movie, but for those who are not dedicated film buffs, the Criterion price is way too expensive."
2,Severely Disappointed with Results,"After searching high and low for something that would help my 5 year old black lab's arthritis and elbow displasia I was convinced I had found the solution. I read countless reviews as to how wonderful this product was and how quickly it transformed the reviewer's dogs back to a puppy-level of activity. I now am leery as to whom the actual writers of those reviews are. My dog has been taking these pills for nearly 6 weeks now and has shown ZERO improvement - in fact, I actually think that he has started limping more.I am thrilled if some of you have success and are able to help relieve your dogs pain - just wanted to be sure that potential buyers know that this doesn't work for everyone. We are back to the drawing board I guess. Poor pup."
4,Appears to be helping,Vet recommended. Seems to help. My Dog has a VERY bad back (Dachshund) I buy in here...MUCH cheaper than the vet offers...GO AMAZON!! :)
1,Good premise - poorly written and edited,I purchased this book for Kindle for $0.99...and I wish I could get my money back.It is very seldom that I can't finish a book but I gave up on this one about half way through. It is in dire need of additional editing. Not only is it filled with typos...it drags on needlessly.I found this book overly simplistic and needlessly preachy. The premise of the story is strong and it started out well but sadly seems to have fallen flat.
2,Trite,"Fr. Mitch Pacwa calls books like this ""bubble gum for the brain."" It was very simply written. It's purely Protestant. There's a very subtle anti-Catholic undertone. We're repeatedly told about the wrongs of ""the church."" The big heros being the Puritans. When did that happen? The Puritans fled England were it was ""join the official Church of England or die."" They landed here and treated all non-Puritans with the same contempt. Their idea of religious freedom was freedom for Puritans alone. Their idea of truth was Puritan truth alone. The author falls into the same trap many others have. That ""real"" witches were burned at the stake. Not so. The Puritans burned many of their own. But by and large non-Puritan Christians were seen as witches and heretics. Such as the Quakers who were often branded, literally, as witches."
5,The Veritas Conflict,Move over Frank Peritti and Randy Alcorn we have a new awsome writer in Christian fiction. This book had be glued from start to finish.
2,IF THIS IS THE FUTURE OF RATT--YOU CAN COUNT ME OUT!,"THE RATT OF THE YESTERYEARS HAD FUN LYRICS AND GREAT GUITAR LICKS AND SOLOS. NOW THEY HAVE A BUNCH OF MIDTEMPO ROCKERS THAT ARE MISSING BALLS, HEART, AND SOUL. DID I MENTION BALLS? THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO SLEAZE IN HERE. COMEBACK? WHERE I DONT SEE IT. I JUST HOPE THEY KICK IT WITH THE NEW SINGER AND GROW SOME NEW BALLS. THE ONLY POSITIVE SIDE TO THIS NEW ALBUM IS WE MIGHT HEAR A NEW SONG PLAYED ON TOUR INSTEAD OF THE GREATEST HITS TOUR OVER AND OVER AGAIN. (CLEAR THROUGHT>LIKE< MOTLEY CRUE) WELL IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN A COMEBACK RECORD CHECK OUT NEW TATTOO FROM THE CRUE."
1,RATT-N-ROLL? Mice fans pay the toll!,"This is a prime example of why we can't change the tv clicker from VH-1 when they show their ""Where are they now?"" shows. Lyrics laced together with bad rhyme schemes (i.e. early KISS tunes), Stephen Pearcy whining his raspiness with forced ineptitude, and cheesy guitar licks (just how many of the songs on this ""album!??!"" begin with the same boring guitar effect?) all add up to a ""bowl of queso cheese fondue!"" RATT had it going on until ""Detonator"" and should have just faded into the sunrise just as most of the 80's hair-bands did/should have. Just like my mom saw Elvis in 50s and 60s with high anticipation, she refrained from seing him glomp onto stage in the 70s with a half hoagie hanging out of polyster fatsuit. RATT-N-ROLL will always be a part of me but as for this ""Portrait"" they should wipe the fog off and REALLY look in the mirror!"
5,Amazing return for 80's rockers,"This is how to make a comeback! This cd is great with the band keeping their classic sound with enough updates to attract new fans. As for the songs opener ""Over the Edge"" is amazing and ""We don't Belong"" is a rare love ballad that shows real emotion as does the bitter sweet ""Tug of War"" and The cd ends with the best song they have ever written ""So Good So Fine"" In short this is the cd Def Leppard should had made and Aerosmith use to make! Finally try not to sing to ""Luv Sick"" Long Live Ratt-N-Roll P.S. Go see The 2nd Best Tour of the year Ratt/Poison F.Y.I. OZZFEST is the first."
2,"They're back, but not necessarily better........","First off, this is WAY better than 'Collage'. This actually sounds like a real Ratt album. Just had to get that out of the way. Although it sounds like Ratt, it is missing something. It's hard to put my finger on it, but I am disappointed with this. ""Over The Edge"" is a pretty cool tune. ""Gave Up Givin' Up"" is ok. ""We Don't Belong"" is the ballad here. It's not bad. Doesn't quite live up to ""Givin' Yourself Away"", though. ""Dead Reckoning"" is maybe my favorite cut from the CD. I really like the guitar riff and the bass at the beginning. The rest is ok. Not great, but not bad either. I would recommend this to a serious Ratt fan who wants to hear something new from the band. Otherwise, pass on it and get one of their older releases."
1,Um...,This download led me from the Ratt EP. This yellow album is NOT the EP! Can we update this link please?
3,Ok if your a RATT fan.,"The new CD starts our great with Over the Edge. Breakout is OK as well. The rest is not up to the Ratt of the 80's. I was suprised at how alot of the songs start with the same guitar riffs. I personally feel they miss Crosby and Croucier's writing ability. If you look at the earlier albums they both had writing credits on most of the songs. The new album lacks the hard driven guitar and catchy bass riffs that made songs like Lay it Down and Dance so good. I like RATT and I listen to their greatest hits all the time. I am not disappointed that I bought it, but I don't see it being at the top of my RATT play list."
3,This is not the EP you idiots...,Oh man are some of you junkies. Get a grip. Over all this cd is good and it jams. But to think you are getting You think your tough or Sweet Cheater - get a grip.
3,Interesting,"A lot of people are confusing this for the self titled EP. That's something entirely different.I think this release is a mixed bag. I dig that isn't the same Ratt n Roll sound and found the laid back pace and the added acoustic to be very refreshing. Warren DeMartini proves he's a legend.. although so under rated. But Pearcy's voice is crap. He can't even hold a note let alone find the right note in quite a few spots. I can't believe they'd keep some of those awful takes. The lyrics are kinda blah as well and sometimes seemed out of place with the great music. But overall, I love the CD and try not pay attention to the lyrics. I think had it been released ""back in the day"" it would have been huge instead of something at the bottom of the bargain bin. I also think the ""mix"" is top notch and well produced, although a far cry from the more raw Ratt sound you'd expect. But again, I found it refreshing."
3,Ratt,"I'm glad it's Stephen Pearcy singing on this album, but the music is only so-so compared to their previous releases. Okay, but nothing spectacular, and certainly not heavy rotation. I just recently purchased their newest 2010 release and it is MUCH better. I would go with that one if I were you."
5,RATT - An album every Ratt fan needs,"Ratt was one of the first ""Hair Bands"" of the 80's that I followed from their early days into the present and have always been one of my favorites. I didn't even know that they put out an album in 1999 as where I lived at the time didn't have any decent radio stations to give it air time. I think the songs on this album are awesome and seem to coincide with their previous albums sounds and styles...a little bit like all the previous albums. I recently saw Stephen Pearcy in concert promoting himself as RATT...he was terrible. Buy the albums but stay away from seeing him live as his voice sounds ruined and he tends to stray from Ratt music and do covers. My 2 favorite songs on this album are ""Tug of War"" and ""Gave Up Givin Up""."
4,Ratt-N-Roll....isn't music better when you can sing along?,"Where to begin...aren't we all tired of the evolution of grunge into ten thousand soundalike, forgettable sellouts dominating the rock scene? It's poetic justice that one of the stalwarts of the ""hair band"" days still puts out one of the best, most original and listenable albums of 1999."
5,welcome back hair bands alway liked ratt and still do!,Achild of the eightees i grew up listening to the original hair band its real nice to see ratt making a comeback .this album is goood! take a listen for yourself!
5,The best Ratt album in years!,"I'm a guy who grew up in the 80's,and bands like Motley Crue,Ratt,Poison,etc.I must say that this new Ratt cd is the best hard rock album in years,and the best Ratt cd since ""Dancing Undercover"".The lyrics are decent,and Stephen Pearcy sounds to be in peak voice.Warren is a little more reserved than in the past.I guess he's already proven how fast he is,now he seems to have found a cool tone and a more relaxed style.Bobby Blotzer is great as usual on drums.These guys are one of the most underrated bands ever.It's too bad Pearcy had to leave the band again.Ratt(portrait)is the best album I have heard in ages.Check out Over The Edge,Gave Up Givin'Up,Luv Sick and So good,So Fine.The whole disc is solid,but those are my faves.Ratt has managed to stick to what they do best,while coming up with a more modern sound.If you like great,stylish hard rock,then pick this one up.It's definetly worth the money."
5,Ultimate Jimmy Buffett,If you are a parrothead....you will love this karaoke CD. I highly recommend it. I just wish it has ALL of Jimmy's songs....
2,pure prairie league concert classics vol. 1,"out of all the music i have (300 cd's) pure prarie league is one of my favorites. but out of all their albums there is no doubt that ""live takin'the stage"" is their best work. it is the only live album that i'll listen to. put concert classics vol. 1 back on the shelf and pull ""live takin'the stage"" back off the shelf and reissue that one,please!"
1,I agree with the music fan from New York,This CD was a very bad offering. It was nothing like the live album Takin' the Stage. The only decent song was Two Lane Highway.
1,No comparison,"This album didn't get close to the real League,If you want a live album Live Takin The Stage is it. I would run not walk to buy it if they would re-issue it."
2,What happened to the music.,I have been listening to Pure Praire League for a lot of years. I have been trying to find an album they did which Vince Gill played on called Taking the Stage. Has this album been put on CD and if not why.
2,"Looks good, quality poor",I agree with the first reviewer. I bought this hair dryer in December 2008 and it quit working in May 2010. I had problems with it from the start. More than half the time I used it the hair dryer would shut off before my hair was dry. Due to the smell I could tell it was overheating. It would operate again in about 10 minutes. This went on until it finally quit working for good this month. The product looks good and I love a wall mounted hair dryer but I need one that works until my hair is dry. We had no problems with our old wall mounted hair dryer but needed a replacement after someone dropped it on the counter and cracked it. I would not recommend this hair dryer for anyone who has thick or medium to long hair as it will not get your hair dry before shutting off.
4,Excellently Researched- A Must Read!,"This tells the story of the struggle of gays in America and the great Stonewall riots of the 60s that made Conservative America realize the existence of gay people and how they would no longer be treated as second-class citizens. (A story largely ignored and continued to be ignored by the mainstream press) and the boiling point. Stonewall is when gays strucks back and fought force with force. Violence with violence. No longer would they tolerate such abuses of their basic rights in supposedly ""freedom-loving"" America. Well-Researched, well-written, a great book and a must read for all!"
2,bland and boring,"MARTIN DUBERMAN 8/6/30--history professor.Book--May 1994.THE STONEWALL--bar-Greenwich Village,NY--6/28/1969.G A Y.6 people. A routine bar check by police turns into a R I O T !2 reviewers...say it best---it is BORING and BLAND.!Iam glad I got this book at the library and did not waste my$$$ on it.bbbpokc ok63retired"
5,Enjoy true Personal Stories,This book allows the reader to enjoy true personal stories of oppression and uprising. I really enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone.
1,"Not history, but interviews with dubiously relevant people.","This isn't really history. It's interviews with six people, of whom only two (Craig Rodwell and Foster Gunnison) really contributed anything to the homophile/gay liberation movement. The other four were, at best, peripheral. This book doesn't convey the excitement of the early years of the Gay Liberation Front -- the radical vision, the militant demonstrations, the personal experimentation. A much better account can be found in the older book by Don Teal, _The Gay Militants_."
4,Feedback on Natur-Leaf,"I have been using the product for less than 60 days. I have not had any side effect from the supplements. It was recommended by Dr. Don Colbert for individuals with an Autoimmune Disease, therefore, I take it instead of taking a prescribed medication, which did produce a negative side effect. All is well thus far."
4,"Delayed justice, delayed clean-up","A team of attorneys takes on a case that leaves them bankrupt and their firm destroyed, and years later, the EPA is the one that wins the case and forces two polluting companies to clean up their collective act. Well acted by Travolta, Duvall, Quinlan, and many others. It takes longer than necessary to tell the story, but makes a strong point about corporate responsibility, liability, and personal struggles."
4,A so-so plot carried through by good acting,"the only thing that helped this movie was good acting. travolta gave a very convincing performance, and duvall was magnificent. other than this however, the plot was nothing more than a drawn-out episode of law and order. it was interesting, but not the action-packed suspense movie some might expect. nonetheless, worth the rental, not the purchase."
2,A Poor Drama,Here is a film that slowly and solidly builds to a rather unsatisfying climax and essentially leaves its audience hanging out to dry. The film's denouement is ineptly filmed and edited and leaves the viewer empty with an unemotional response or better yet no response. This is a perfect example of post-romantic Hollywood filmmaking where visuals are not on the screen but are left to the mind's eye.
2,Spare Me...,"I can't believe people gave this movie a good review. I saw it, sure its a good movie but not a five star movie! John Travolta and Robert Duvall are at the turning point in their careers. The only person I thought who did an ""exceptional"" job was William H. Macy (Mystery Men, Psycho: a remake, Boogie Nights). I'll admit John Travolta did a good job same with Robert Duvall but the movie is too low grade for them. The plot is about a town where people are dying of a possible contamination in the water. Thats where clever lawyer John Travolta comes in. At first it seems like the case is too good to be true so e immediatly signs on... Well it turns out it isn't that easy and the company Jonny-o is filing against isn't backing down... On a rating of A+ to a f I'd give it a C+. The movies characters are written exceptionally and well acted. But the plot ceases to entertain you."
4,Solid Flick with very pertinent material despite its age.,As a former resident of the Greater Boston area this was a film that evoked memories on a number of levels. The investigations of cancer clusters and their relationship to EPA Super Fund Sites is still something that should be coordinated. Moving film with solid performances.The follow up to the story is perhaps more hopeful. The sites have been cleaned and are being utilized! Despite the irepairable damage done to these families America can heal itself via the tenacious actions of its citizen/victims and the scar tissue shoud be a reminder as to the dangerous and destructive nature of unmonitored business interests.
5,"A Very Good Drama, But!","A really great story supposely based on true story gripping in it's tale of greedy & lies behind a secret that could destroy a town & company along with it . John Travolta does an excellent job as the lawyer seeking the truth behind the lies but it may cost him all he has . The beef i have with this film though is that it should've got an R - rating for the lauagage in it shame on the rating people for letting it slide by . it has the f word three times it . i personally think that it could have done without it , but hey that's just me, besides that it's a great flick . if they ever do an edited version of this film, just take the lauguage out leave content in thank you. the whole cast does great job.Highly Recommended still,I still think it should've got an R- Rating."
2,not a particularly good movie,"According to the reviews on Amazon I stood a good chance of buying a great movie from my favorite on-line movie store. But alas, this time I was disappointed by the yarn that was spun by Steve Zaillan et al. The movie was simply too long for what it had to tell. Don't get me wrong: I like a good long movie when there is a good build-up of suspense or maybe an in-depth character study that really gets you into the movie. ""A civil action"" had neither I'm afraid. Although I really like Robert Duvall a lot, I have to say that the character he plays in this movie is just too strange to be more than fleetingly interesting. The story winds down from a good start to a very disappointing anti-climax. The people who are at the heart of this story (the parents of the children that have died of various polution-related diseases) are markedly absent and this alone renders the movie inadequate and frankly, a waste of time."
2,READ THIS!!!,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WATCHING THIS FILM, THIS COULDN'T BE MORE OF A CLEARER CASE OF THE BOOK BEING MUCH BETTER THAN THE FILM, THIS IS COMING FROM A PERSON WHO READS BOOKS FOR PLEASURE ONCE IN A BLUE MOON, I'M TELLING YOU'D BE BETTER OFF READING THE BOOK, THE EVENTS ALL HAPPEND AND THE STORY IS TOLD BETTER.THOUGH I UNDERSTAND THE BUSINESS SIDE OF IT, ITS A SHAME THEY PUT THE MOVIE PUBLICITY PICTURE ON THE COVER OF THE BOOK, ITS LIKE A LOUSY ATHLETE BEING VOTED ON THE ALL-STAR TEAM JUST BECAUSE ALL THE TEAMS HAVE TO BE REPRESENTED.THATS ALL I GOTTA SAY!"
2,The book is SO MUCH BETTER,The movie is fine... but the book is an amazing read. There is so much detail and nuance lost in the adaption to a visual medium.
1,Read the book,"Don't bother wasting your time with this movie, instead read the book. The book was one of the best I have ever read, the movie left me wanting. I rented the movie after reading the book and never made it all the way through. So maybe I am being unfair since I did not watch the whole movie, but honestly I couldn't, it just didn't do the story justice. For a book that was captiviating they sure made the movie boring, if the movie industry is in this to make money, they should have tracked the book more closely."
5,Great Movie for A Tort Class,"A Civil Action is an oldie but goodie if you are teaching a torts class to a community college or high school crowd. It should be used at the start of the course and then can be referenced throughout, if a proper course track is implemented."
4,PANIC IN BOSTON,"You know the old saying that courtroom movies are supposed to be boring right.Well forget that and enjoy this one which deals with a story that was worth telling.The story ressembles ERIN BROKOVICH in many aspects:it is about humans and the way a irresponsable corporation can cause deaths just because the job wasn't done right.ROBERT DUVALL in a supporting role steals the show,but JOHN TRAVOLTA is also well cast.You'll laugh when you'll see him get two speed contaventions in a row.You'll also understand while viewing this,why justice is a game that can get as far as morgatging your house as a guarantee for handling the debts of a trial.I'd rather see ten films like this rather than one mindless science-fiction techno action bore ,complete with heavy-metal music."
2,Poor video transfer to DVD format,"A Civil Action is a great movie, but the video transfer to DVD was less than satisfactory. The picture was noticeably unclear and uncrisp at times, especially during scenes where the camera was moving. Until all DVDs can deliver superior quality on a consistent basis, VHS will remain the preferred format."
2,Failed to generate any emotional energy...a disappointment,"Living in the Boston area, we were pretty excited to watch this movie about the real-life Woburn case. Both Travolta and the script left us detached and deflated. William Macy was the best thing about the movie. Certainly not a flick worth purchasing."
1,Papa Bob,"I was waiting for the ""To Be Continued"" sign to come up at the end of this movie. Where did the Healer go to? Are the parents lovey dovey again, which is the impression they leave you with? What about the Healer's baby? Did he just walk out on it? I think that 1 star is too high a rating for this disjointed movie."
1,Don't waste your money!,"Give this one a miss. It was terrible. It had no point at all. I'm a huge fan of the LOTR Trilogy, so I figured I'd give it a shot since Miranda Otto (who plays Eowyn in LOTR) was in it. What a waste of time! The person who said they want those ""113 minutes of their life back"" is dead right.Sure, it may be realistic in the beginning, but this is a prime example of one of the things that drives me crazy about indy movies. They get too pretentious when they try to be so character driven, and spend too much time giving us information we really don't need to know.It could have been much more magical, but it gives us a boring ending--not to mention it drags on for ages before anything happens. The cast itself was really blah. Eowyn (hehe) is good, playing the sympathic mother role. But after that, well. That's about it. If you have to see it, rent it before you buy it. It's definitely not worth the cost of purchasing it new."
2,Unresolved,"There is some really good acting by all the cast which is why it deserved the two stars. As another reviewer stated, the plot threads are left unresolved and the ending seemed kind of like someone said, ""ok, here's the two hour mark. Wrap it up."" I did like that they were starting to explore the issue of religious and spiritual beliefs, but they dropped it pretty quickly. How does the healing of her child effect the mother's own spiritual belief system? Dunno. It was like, kid healed, end of story.(not end of movie--I didn't spoil the ending). Mother has affair with healer and then poof, he's gone. Why? Where'd he go? What's he up to now? How did this affair effect him after he went back to his country? Dunno.The script needed some healing."
4,"beautiful, but unresolved","This is an odd, sad story, but I do love it. Miranda Otto and William Fichtner both give wonderful performances. Julie and Henry's relationship troubles, together with their son's illness and the family's struggle to define itself both spiritually and emotionally, make the movie very moving. It's about trust and forgiveness as much as it's about faith. Alexy is a sweet weirdo, vulnerable and lonely, trying to work out his own issues and the sudden, earth-shattering presence of Julie in his life. His side of the plot was left very unresolved. He appears to have walked out of Julie's world as abruptly as he entered it."
2,One of these reviews discourages me!,"If this version of the Alamo story equates with that of Allen Huffines' extreme version, then I won't buy it! A few years ago, Huffines was a consultant for another ""Alamo"" movie - the movie was a flop!Discriminating Customer"
5,A great resource for studying the Alamo,"By compiling all known first-hand accounts of the siege of the Alamo (including some with a debatable authenticity, duly noted by the author), Bill Groneman has produced an excellent, handy resource for studying this famous incident. Going back to the original sources is always the best way to gain a sense of what really happened, and ""Eyewitness to the Alamo"" lets the reader do this with a minimum of trouble. Groneman's comments about the various source documents are a helpful guide to their reliability, although of course not everyone would necessarily agree with his every assessment (I have particularly in mind the De la Pena ""Diary""). This book makes a great companion to Alan Huffines ""Blood of Noble Men"" in which Huffines arranges excerpts from many of these accounts into chronological order to tell the Alamo story."
2,Too long and needs a summary,"The book is set up as a series of accounts from numerous sources. Some are verified accounts and others are third-party accounts.The oldest discovered accounts are at the front of the book and the newest discovered accounts are at the back. As you might imagine ""history"" changes over time so that the older accounts tend to be believed while the newer ones are mostly fiction.Unfortunately this makes the reading after about a hundred pages irrelevant as the author believes the latter accounts to be false, which makes me wonder why I would want to read those accounts at all.The other aspect is there is no summary of all the accounts to give a clear picture of what really happened. I know that the author's intent was to be unbiased, but he could give the accounts then make a summary based on his investigations. This would wrap up many loose ends, which would make the book complete."
4,simply abundant (Like 'The Journey:Where seagulls dare to f,simply abundant with pearls of wisdom......simply learning how to breathe again...to reconnect with myself again...to retune to my inner child again....simply beautiful. Still haven't found a book though as good as 'The Journey:Where Seagulls Dare To Fly' (www.amazon.co.uk)...therefore 4 stars only!
4,A Good Book for Christian Teens,"This book is about a teenager who is trying to adjust to her new life. Jacie is not sure what to think of the new girl, Hannah, who is a little strange. She is a good Christian...but maybe a little too good for Jacie. Meanwhile, Jacie is struggling with her art, trying to get into an art class...but is she good enough? And, how will she be able to witness to others if she freezes up every time she has the perfect oppurtunity. Will she live up to Hannah's expectations and get into the art class? And...what about her relationship with the ""bad boy"" at school? Read it and find out. Also read fast forward to normal. These books are great for girls ages 11-14 but older teens may enjoy something more complex like the Christy Miller series. Anyway, they are bothe good Christian series and I reccomend you to read them!!!"
4,Just cute little stories,I got started on Joan Hess books from her Arly Hanks Maggody series (fantastic books). These are not as good but still quite entertaining little stories. The books are never more then 225 pages and are easy reading. The dialogue between Claire and her daughter is worthy enough to be a SNL skit. These books will not make you think but they will make you laugh.
4,Entertaining,"Didn't have to work too hard to finish this book, it was a good read, an interesting little book, and not difficult to follow at all. Well written, I must say, and I did enjoy it."
4,Dear Miss Demeanor,"This book was saucy and I enjoyed it very much. Until the ending. I was left feeling as though it wasn't finished. But there wasn't any conclusion concerning Miss Dort, and Miss hart's fickle boyfriend. Miss Dort, helped the now dead principle with a crime, and I feel that before the book ended, they both should have been dealth with. So although I liked the book, I certainly didn't like the ending, it didn't solve anything. I hope in one of her future books she will take care of this. anna cook"
2,Could Have Been Better....,"I thought this book would have been interesting since I am a student currently going into teaching myself. Boy, was I wrong. I'm not sure if it was because this book was written years ago and teaching might have been different, but there were many things that Claire did that would NEVER have been acceptable nowadays in the school system. Also, I'm not sure if this is because this book is one from a long going series, but I felt like the relationships between the characters (especially Claire and Peter Rosen's) was very unrealistic and didn't seem to have much substance. I also felt like there was much detail lacking in the story. I think the story could have been improved if we had more description of what the town is like and how the characters live, etc."
4,Good for the price,"These stretcher bars are a really good deal. The wood was not carved deep enough in some places, so I had to use a hammer to get them to stick together properly. The outcome was good though and they did the job well."
3,Ok for the price,The stretcher legs were not milled perfectly so I had to switch them around a few times to get the best fit. A little sanding brought everything into alignment. Overall it gets the job done with a little extra effort.
3,Not as good as the Pro Lite brand,"Even though the picture of the Masterpiece looks very sturdy, in real life, it's not. I'm guessing that picture is for a very small frame size, which proportionally makes the frame look sturdier than a larger size. The Pro Lite brand (Pro Lite Artist Stretcher Bar Single Bar 20"") is better.. Some of the bars have alignment problem by about 1mm. I had to use sand paper to make it even.. Thinner than the Pro Lite. Both are supposed to be 3/4"" thick, but the Pro Lite is about 1/16"" thicker. The edge where the canvas touches the bars is square and sharp while the edge of the Pro Lite is curved and smooth."
4,wife loves 'em,"Christmas present to my wife, who loves them. However, they're not very durable. One has already come apart."
1,Don't waste your time (or money)...,"I got to see a preview of this title yesterday. I only managed to force myself to watch 35 minutes of this movie before realising, it didn't get any better and my time was more valuable than spending it watching this trash.Briefly, it's a *very* low budget horror flick. Some people are out in a section of a forest (which for some reason, doesn't show up on maps of the area), and they run into a ""big-foot"" type monster. It mauls people, they die (and amazingly, while being ripped apart, there are no screams from the actors, just splashes of fake blood onto the camera lens).The acting is wooden. The camera work is attrocious (including a lot of steady shots of people which suddenly change to zoom in and then zoom outs). The storyline is nothing new.I couldn't put in more time watching this. It may have improved after the 35 minute mark, but frankly, I no longer cared.There are a *lot* of low budget movies out there that are much better than this."
1,bad b movie...dont watch,horrible movie with really bad acting and really bad special effects. A guy in a monkey suit is what you will be watching for the remainder of the movie. avoid....at all cost.
2,Small volume without much detail,Apparently the author spent as much time thinking up a catchy title as writing the book which is very narrow and provides only tiny summaries of many of the commanders. It holds some interest as a reference.
4,Nice,"It's kind of tight on the head, and you have to pin it in place if you want it to stay, but I like it better than headband ones because it's just the hair and there's nothing underneath the braid to show through. I bought the light brown and I thought it would be lighter than it actually is. If you have blond hair at all (even brown hair with blond highlights), go with the BLOND. Light brown is for those who have medium brown hair... or at least that's what I think. I gave the light brown one to my mom and her hair is a medium brown color."
1,garbage,do not buy this garbage it was so tight on the hear I bought it thinking it was thick but it was a thin and flimsy piece of grabage
4,"Looks real, and good!","I ordered one first from another seller on Amazon and the ""brown"" was a lot lighter than my color hair. So I didn't want to get my hopes up when I ordered this one, but it matched my dark brown hair perfectly. The headband isn't too tight so it fits just right and isn't uncomfortable or digging into my scalp. I'd recommend this to people with dark brown hair!"
2,Not appropriate for the true emergent reader,"While this set is entertaining and certainly appropriate for the beginning reader, the emergent reader will be frustrated by the small size of the print, the lack of exagerrated spacing between words and the lack of predictable language. The books are more appropriate for the average second semester first grader."
5,A Must Have,"If you enjoy/love Cuban music or rather any great music this recording will amaze you. If you are a fan of NG La Banda or Los Van Van this is a ""must have"" recording you will want to add to your collection of Cuban dance music. The musicianship is out of this world. This band does things I have never heard another band even attempt. The horn section is simply astounding. ""LOS METALES DE TERROR"" indeed! The drumming and dance groove is as tight as I have ever heard it. Most of the songs on this recording will have you out of your seat and moving. There are a few flute tunes by El Tosco that set a different atmosphere. If you like ""Los Van Van Live at Miami Area"" this is a studio recording that captures the genius of Afro-Cuban music at its best. Not to be missed!"
2,Disappointing,"This movie is for Third Eye Blind fans only. The frontman for the popular rock band does a reasonable job considering he's not a professional actor. However the movie overall is filled with bad dialog, bad acting bad scripting... I was able to get through it but then again I am a fan of Stephan Jenkins' music. I think if it were not for that bias I wouldn't be as kind as I am being here:) Suffice it to say that if you've never heard of Third Eye Blind you should probably steer clear of this movie."
5,GOOD MOVIE,THIS WAS A VERY GREAT MOVIE SHE WENT THROUGH ALL THAT TROUBLE TO GET BACK AT HER EX-HUSBAND WOW.I WOULDNT NEVER DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT JUST MOVE ON.
4,Worth a watch,"This is a solid little flick I dont regret buying. Nichole Hiltz doesnt disappoint. Dont waste money on the bluray version though. The video quality is acceptable, but below average for even a regular DVD."
1,art of revenge,this is totally rubbish.story ok.but the shooting is unbelievable cheap. i think this is the cheapest movie ever made.the picture is the lowest quality ihave seen in bluray dont buy this film cause you will regret it for your money
4,"Great book, thanks","Well-written and I've enjoyed the ride. Too bad much of my reading has been out of sequence, but it was vintage Coonts."
4,Good book,"This book was great in it's time, but only gets 4 stars as some characters are outdated. I don't like to make a habit of giving any plot away, but what I will say is Stephen has a great way of getting the reader to visualize a situation. There are situations in this book that as the reader you feel could happen today, whereas any other author you may find it to be too obsured to be real.Great read, especially for the reader who does not trust the government to get the job done right."
1,Finale Fizzle,"This book may deserve a better rating because it is a monumental story and very well written, however the ending and some of the reaches the author makes throughout this epic make is very unsatisfactory and disappointing. I personally did not read anything else by this author after being an avid reader for many years. The ending is that bad.Also there is the very 1980's steep to the whole work. It is very anachronistic today and would have been had it been written in the 70's. Much has happened since the depths of the drug wars in the 80's and we have a new understanding of the dynamics involved today. Parts of this work hinge on the desperate fear Americans had then of destruction at the hands of drug cartels which was displaced Cold War apprehension.No doubt a tremendous work, resurrecting familiar characters into an unlikely setting, the stretches and total collapse at the finale earn this one a single star."
1,A LOUSY COONTS,"I have read most of Coonts' books but if I had read this one first I would have stopped completely. This story is so unrealistic is doesn't even merit fantasy. The characters are stilted and unbelievable including their names. The beginning is poor, the plot line is terrible and the ending is totally devoid of any semblance of literary know how. I have great praise for most of Coonts' other works but would recommend this one for use as a door stop only or perhaps in a writing class on how not to do it."
3,SKYKOG Review of Under Siege,"I did not find this Novel as good as other Jake Grafton novels; perhaps because it moves away from what Coonts knows best (war/technology/flying) into the world of drugs and the drug problem with an underlying theme of legalizing drugs. It was interesting (but having worked undercover drugs as a law enforcement officer) not compelling. Also found it unrealistic in killing off Fidel Castro in this novel (didn't bring anything to the plot).. but killing him off again in a later Jake GrRafton novel (Cuba). Introduction of the Newspaper Reporter character Jack Y was kind of a highlight, particularly in light of the following novel (Red Horseman). Also enjoyed the characterizations of our Congressmen and believed that to be a fair assessment of some of our elected officials. The portrayal of Bush and Quayle were interesting."
3,Awesome!,Great potential modern-day events and reactions. Character development was involved and required attention. I never wanted to put it down.
3,A great begining!,"From the start Coonts gets your attention. The US Govt. brings a drug lord to America to stand trial. He uses Columbian tactics to be released. Everything from commando teams to an assassin to take out the President. The book starts to flow when the assassin wounds President Bush. The story is great. Well developed...until the end. I would have given this book 4 stars if the ending would have lived up to the rest of the interesting story line. With what we have learned in the book about the assassin, it is hard to believe he would act as he does after being so meticulous."
2,This is not the best of the best of Britcoms.,"I would say that if you were a Britcom fan, this would only tantalize you and leave you wanting sooo much more. If you really wish to get all the goodies, take the jump and get the full sets. You will regret not knowing what went on after the first series for these well performed shows of British wit. Also you should not forget ""The Vicar of Dibley"". I waited 7 years for them on DVD, and never regreted spending a penny. Dawn French and the rest of the cast were Brilliant!"
5,The Rentals Rule,"The Rentals have once again won my affection with this ode to hedonism, Seven More Minutes. Quirky lyrics and catchy melodies combine for a tour de force like no other for the last several years. This Japanese edition is even more recommended as it has a bonus b-side entitled ""The Great Bank Robbery"". Like the other tracks on the album, the Rentals execute their performance with perfection. I have compared it to a mix between Jumping Around (From the this album) and the Beatle's Rocky Raccoon. Whether this Japanese edition or their others, this albu is an absolute must for any rock, new wave, or Weezer fan!"
5,Enthralling Read!,I loved this story line. I loved the romance amid a compelling plot. Elizabeth peters draws you in from page 1. A happy ending and a mystery solved. A must read.
5,A Lasting Joy,"I first read this book when it was published. I have lost count of the number of times I have read it since then. This was among the first books to go to my Kindle. I love all of Elizabeth Peters' books, but for sheer lunacy, this one remains my favorite."
3,Not So Good,"I am a big fan of Elizabeth Peters and have loved everything I have read, however in the case of this book I really did not enjoy it.Something was lacking with the main characters, I never felt that I got to know anyone and I was really rather irritated at the way the book ended, it just stopped dead. It really didn't read like the usual Peters writing, but no one can please everyone all the time.I am still a fan and looking forward to another of her books."
3,ehh.. it was all right,"Fun, nice dialog, nice characters. The story's conclusion just didn't carry much punch for me."
4,true to elizabeth peters style,"I am a great fan of the Amelia Peabody series and stumbled upon this while looking for a new release.The humor, the suspense and intrigue, and clues with multiplemeanings are all there.You'll be surprised by the ending. Nice and easy reading for the mystery fan"
1,Very Disappointing,"Elizabeth Peters is one of my favorite writers but this book was very disappointing--actually downright stupid. The situations were so convoluted and so much suspencion of belief was required that it wasn't any fun and after a while you really don't care. Too bad really but it failed to be ""spooky"" or even interesting."
2,Get what you pay for,I had been using more expensive strings and decided to give these a shot after reading reviews. I put the strings on on Wednesday and was very happy with the sound. I played for about an hour and put the banjo away on it's stand. I picked it up on Friday to play and noticed the strings had started to rust! The strings sound horrible now! For the extra 5 bucks I am going to go back to paying a bit more but getting more than an hour of good sound out of them.
5,"Great tone, sweet sound","They really are good for trailing. Good tone throughout. The fourth string is both snazzy and functional! Great price, too."
5,great product at a reasonable price,"I ordered this to replace the mixer I was using to control levels in my studio and couldn't be happier. The large knob makes fine adjustments to volume really easy. I also like that there are 3 outputs that can be used in any combination at the push of a button. I am using 2 sets of monitors, (on A &B) with a sub on channel C that I can combine with either speaker set. The talkback Mic & headphones controls are nice too. And although it has only 4 inputs, the use of a patch bay effectively eliminates that limitation. Great product!"
1,Totally unreliable,"I bought this less than a month ago, handled it carefully, and always used the ""Safely Remove Hardware"" feature of Windows.The drive worked for two weeks, then stopped working. I paid to return it, waited two weeks, and got a new one. The new one lasted only one week. Lexar will not do anything beyond replacing it again.This product is far inferior to others on the market, such as PNY (and even Lexar's older Jumpdrive models). Stay away if you value your data (and productivity)."
4,Can't Live Without It Now,"I absolutely love my JumpDrive. I'll never need a floppy disk again. I use it to store just about everything I'm currently working on so I can access my files no matter where I am - home, work or anywhere there's a computer.I only have two complaints. For some reason, the cap fits better in one direction than the other, but there's no way to tell by looking. And it's inevitable that I'll lose the cap one day.On the positive side, it seems very sturdy. I like that the keychain ring is metal instead of plastic. I've pretty much abused it by throwing it in my purse, pockets, and laptop bag. It still works like a charm. It's easy to use and transfers files quickly."
1,Not Up To Expectations,"Being a Lexar Product, I expected a more quality item. I've purchased and used many Lexar products and have been very happy with them, but this Secure Digital unit was very disappointing.This item IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH ALL VERSIONS OF WINDOWS XP, and trying to get some kind of sensible answer from the service department at Lexar about this was a joke. I just use it as a non-secure drive. The software incorporated within the unit uses a twelve bit encoding system, according to my Windows XP disk analizer. Why not an eight, sixteen, or thirty-two bit?"
1,Weak and unreliable,"Like many others have said, this thing will not take any abuse at all. The caps constantly fall off, and most of the time it will automatically reboot your computer as soon as you connect it to the USB ports. This will lose all information. I have experience with many of these. Do not buy this one!"
1,Too fat and too fragile,"I have had two of these drives fail in a matter of months. If you get one of these, be sure to back up any data on another device. I realize that is good advice for any medium but is especially true for these drives.The drive is so wide that it blocks a port on each side of it on my USB Hub. So, it uses three ports instead of one unless I put it in an end slot. Then it uses two.Finally, I had problems with the ""secure"" feature. On one drive, the secured files suddenly became inaccessible.The idea is good but the excecution is not."
1,Don't do it!,"I was really excited to get the JumpDrive because of the reviews I read. True, it is a lot more durable than many flash drives, but I've had so many problems that it's entirely not worth it. From day one I was unable to use it with most of the computers at school because the JumpDrive tries to install its ""secure"" software onto whatever computer you plug it into. Most public computers will not allow this due to all of the computer viruses going around. Unfortunately, if the software doesn't install you can't access the drive. Another problem that I've had while using it with friends' computers is that it will occasionally delete entire batches of files! I've always been careful to properly eject the device, but more than once it has deleted numerous files that I had recently saved onto it. I generally like Lexar products, but not this. My friends have cheaper flashdrives that do a much, MUCH better job."
1,Beware of Hardware Failure on this one!,"This drive will not take the abuse of simply having it on the keychain. I had one for just over a year and it began to fail intermittantly and would disconnect. It got worse and finally died within two weeks. After getting a different brand, I took the Lexar apart and found the problem. They have some type of timing device on the circuit board whose pins are bent to accomodate the size of the drive. There is a spacer between the device and the circuit board. When I touched the device, it fell off. The fact that the pins are bent and then soldered cause too much stress on this part and being banged around causes the pins to fracture, the spacer obviously doesn't work and should have been seated with some type of glue. I was actually able to place it back on the circuit board with scotch tape and retrieve my files. If you have a bad one, take it apart and you'll see what I mean."
2,Failed within a year...,"I have used several different types of flash drives over the last couple of years. I have had no problems with any of the models I have used other than this one. The data on it became increasingly garbled and nothing could fix the problem. The drive could not be successfully reformatted and eventually found a home in the ""circular file cabinet"". Also, as others have mentioned, this drive is so thick that it can block an adjacent USB port in addition to the one it is plugged into. All in all, I recommend that you buy one of the other many excellent alternatives available. (I am currently using a SanDisk Cruzer Micro 512MB and it is working fine.)"
2,Lose the cap and it's a goner...,"I carried an ill-fated Lexar Jump drive Secure for about three months. It saved me hours of work in many situations where I needed to transfer files from one computer to another quickly. About a month into it I lost the cap. I just set it down while I was working and voila it was gone. During the next two months, the metal USB connector got polluted with whatever else was in my pocket, so much so that one day it just wouldn't work. No computer would recognize it. Thank goodness that I didn't have crucial data on it at the time. I have been carrying the Lexar Jump Drive Sport for about six months now and have not had the same problem because the rubber lid is ingenuously attached to the device on the ""Sport"" model. I'd rate the Sport model 3-stars higher simply on account of its durability."
3,Fragile Case,"It's not nearly as rugged as it looks. It's encased in a thin, plastic shell that isn't going to take too many bumps before it cracks.It will work well if you're using it to back up data and keep it in your desk drawer, but it won't last long if you're planning on carrying it around in your pocket."
4,"Very Good, Not Great","Nelson Riddle is one of the greatest arrangers who ever lived. But he did his best work arranging for vocalists like Nat Cole and, of course, Sinatra. His all-instrumental records like this two-fer are good music, but not the supreme masterpieces that he will forever be known for. Good, but not great."
5,Good Combustion Book,"This book contains a very good theoretical concepts of turbulent combustion. This book shows why Peters is so much regarded in combustion community. First chapter contains a good overview of present numerical approached to solve turbulent combustion problem. Till now I have covered only premixed part of the book, which I find very interesting and illuminating. Also the book cover G-equation model in very good detail."
4,Why aren't these guys more popular?,"Listening to this album right now. While I don't like it as much as Thundersteel, it seems to be getting better everytime I listen to it.The vocals remind me of Whitesnake with a little bit of Dio thrown it. Very catchy lyrics and of course great guitar playing!If you haven't listened to Riot, you're really missing out on good Heavy Metal."
4,Top Rate Metal for the late 90's,"These Guys were around well before Van Halen, Motley Crue and a boat load of other wannabes. This album shows their dedication to the genre. All of the Riot archives going back to the mid 70's this is Metal this ain't KISS or the Nuge - true metal a true origial and even now they're still metal 25 years on a band given no respect by any one other than their fans such as Motorhead, Entombed, Torch and many other unsungs - a true Heavy Metal Band for the ages!"
5,Flamenco based contemporary spanish rock,"Proof that great things come through mixing different influences. Superb guitar playing, Andalucian Flamenco feeling and light hearted lyrics make this a very interesting example of the high quality of contemporary Spanish music. Well worth buying to find what Latin music is like on the other side of the Atlantic."
5,Excellent book not only on ALA,Dr. Burt Berkson is one of the good ones. He is a very good didact and teaches the reader not only about ALA but also how the achieve health in general. He writes that he takes (among other things) 2x100mg ALA per day as prevention himself.
2,important but somewhat outdated,"Evidence is referenced regarding the benefits of ALA as a powerful antioxidant, which neutralizes free radicals and can protect against cell damage from toxins, chemotherapy, aging, diabetes, and atherosclerosis. Specific references involve ALA's role in the treatment of cataracts, diabetic retinopathy, peripheral neuropathy, nerve degeneration and mushroom poisoning. The book was written in 1998 before the publication of more pessimistic studies of many of the vitamins he covers. Subsequently, however, the ALADIN and SIDNEY studies have been completed reaffirming the role of ALA in preventing the progression of nerve degeneration in peripheral neuropathy.(pnhelp.org > resources > medical literature review)"
4,A wonderful informational book on a little known drug.,THis is a must read for health care professionals as well as others.I strongly recommend this book. I am a Pharmacist andwas very impressed with this new information.
2,"Too long, too short on real detail like dosage.","If only the author had used twenty pages to say what he has said in whole, long, 155 page book. It is too laborious to get essential facts- like optimum dosage for example is nowhere to be found easily, if at all. He knows his stuff, but must it take so long and why no summary page? Also it is a one size fits all- how do people survive all the diseases he outlines without this potion?"
1,Why???,"Why in the world would the kindle edition cost MORE than the hard copy? It's very bad business when Amazon/publishers/authors do this. I think I'll go order a used copy instead. Low rating is for unfair pricing. Please rethink this, ok?"
5,Excellent,"While I don't know why the picture shows 3 different products, I don't understand how Mr. Rodda thought he would receive all three. Written info indicates only the 80305. Bottom line, I ordered two days ago, received today (three days early) with free Super Saver shipping. Fits perfect. Thanks."
5,Brazilian jazz at its best!,"I have been a fan of Kleber Jorge for many years, as my brother Bill Cantos has played with him in his band. I have been an aficionado of Brazilian music since the 60's. I call this album my ""happy music"" - guaranteed to put me in a great mood the from the first cut."
5,best book I've read this fall!,"This is a hilarious book about a girl who is very sad. She also has a wonderful and totally mixed-up homelife. Sound confusing? Actually, it isn't, it's the best book I've read this fall. I felt like I was falling inside the pages. I love books like this. I loaned it to my friend and now I can't get it back!"
4,Good Action Packed Horror.,"This was my first intro to the late Charles Grant and I liked it enough to grab a lot of his other books.The story centers around a clan of deranged night people who are called Jackals, who hunt people whose cars break down on deserted stretches of highway or lonely back roads. The way Charles Grant wrote these 'beings' was clever, because you never really know if they're human or not, even at the end of the book. You have to decide.There are spooky moments and the book was written nice and smooth. The only thing I would have liked was for a little more written on the Jackals' night prowlings. The main story line is defense against them and not more sprawled out, giving you a chance to see behind the scenes of one of their prowls. Other than that, this was a solid, four star book that any fan of classic horror should read. No splatter-gore, but still spook and a decent story."
4,Great sound...too personal for me...my loss,"The musicianship and sound of this disc are excellent, really textured blugrass with a nice full sound. A few of the songs had ""1st person"" lyrics which I found a bit too literal for my tastes but that's me. The sound and concept are similar to ""So Long, So Wrong"" by Union Station.An album Dale should be proud of. Doobie Shea records out of Boones Mill, Va, moved to Nashville a few years ago I think, and these older CD releases by them are lost gems, buy 'em when you find them."
4,OK for a Cheap Laptop,"I have recieved the laptop today. The speed of the laptop is not what I was hoping for. I will have to purchase more memory for it. I have noticed it has been paging about 216 megs on the avg and only leaving me about 39 megs free on the Ram. I will be purchasing more ram for this laptop.The Hard drive has a specs of 20 gigs. I think it might be from the way IBM had set this up its starts out at 15.6 gigs on the hard drive and only leaving you with 10 gigs free on it. You will def need a external hard drive with this unit.There is no software so i suggest you down load open source or if you got copies of office you can use it.One of the best features is it has a long battery life. But if you got the extra cash i suggest you buy HP, Sony or somthing better. if you need the extra power."
4,Old Fan,"I actually bought this binder many years ago when pokemon was first popular. I was quite a bit younger then, and I'm pretty surprised to say that it's survived all these years through my childhood. This binder is pretty durable and stylish. It's not as cheap as another plain binder that you could just put your own picture in the front, but I like the pre-made pokemon design that covers this whole binder, inside and out. This is a collectible from my childhood so I'd recommend this to anyone who is interested in really completing their pokemon cards collection if you're willing to spend a little extra money. I currently have 51 pages of the plastic card holders in it with tons of cards stuffed to the max in them, and I still think a few more pages could fit in; so this binder can definitely hold quite a lot of cards before it bursts at the seams."
1,Rip-Off and Complete Waste of Money,This binder is a completely ordinary three ring binder with a picture of a Pokemon character on the front. Save the $25 and instead buy a plain ring binder and make it special with your own Pokemon pictures. $30 and it does not even come with pockets to hold the cards. I am appalled at the waste.
1,avoid at all costs,"A historical recording it may be, but impossible to listen to. It sounds as if recorded on a home reel- reel tape recorder, complete with variable tape speed.I felt physically ill after listening to it because of the technical problems, the only dud I've bought frm Amazon"
1,Bad advice,"This book advised booking the Cobblestone Motel in Phoenicia, where the author's friend Michelle met us at check in and proceeded to treat us like absolute garbage. My wife was in tears as we left this fleabag, which the author praises, to the ceaseless taunts of the author's friend Michele who followed us out the driveway. It ruined our entire vacation. Luckily for Bob Scharpf he moved down to Florida, far far away from Route 28 and his borderline friend Michelle. I have to suspect the rest of his recommendations need to be taken with a huge grain of salt."
4,Plex Writer,"I bought this deck about six years ago mostly for burning Karaoke song files to disc, not just any burner will do a good job of reproducing the text part of karaoke even though they will do the audio fine. The Plex Writer does a fine job of both if set to 1X burn but will even do an acceptable job most of the time at 4X. It has kept going with no trouble all of the 6 years I've had it.(burns CD format only no DVD)Larry K. (Oskaloosa, Iowa)"
1,Lina Wertmuller Collection,"The description of the product being offered was wrong. Instead of the collection of films by Lina Wertmuller, I only received the Swept Away video, but the provider was correct in issuing me a refund."
5,Full of Information,"This book is great for the the novice. It covers soup to nuts (literally)!! After my first (successful!) attempt at canning tomato sauce and pickeling zucchini, I wanted to get more out of my garden. This year we had to take a hiatus from producing our own vegatables, but I ordered this book now, so I can be better prepared for next year. This books gives tips on types of vegatables to plant, harvesting tips, and a guide on how to best preserve each item. It has also given me plenty ideas to plan for in the next few years. My goal is build a root cellar in my basement. This book was definatly worth the money for the advice it gave me."
5,Preserving Summer's Bounty,It was the first canning book I looked at and plus a friend recomended it. It has everything thing on canning even open canning and the receipes are great and it is also very to read and understand. I would recomended to anyone who is first time canner like me. Great book!!!!!!!!!!!
4,for garden goodies,"I bought 2 of these books at once in Dec (1 was for a gift)to see if I can get some more ideas on how to preserve every thing in my garden this summer, weather it be freeze, dry, can, etc. So far I hadn't had a chnace to use it due time of year, but did like allot of the content. Excited to use it....."
3,Not what I hoped,"I was hoping for more of a canning book with preservation tips. I'd say 3/4ths of the recipes in here are for prepared food, and 1/4 are canning/preserving recipes. If that's what you're looking for you will get much more out of this book than I did."
4,Good info but...,"There is a lot of information in this book and I love how it explains and details the various means of preserving. But...many of the recipes, particularly jams/jellies use honey instead of sugar like most recipes call for. That doesn't work for people with severe honey allergies and I haven't found anything in the book that describes how much sugar should be used in place of honey. As my family's honey allergy causes their throat to swell shut and block their airway, this doesn't work for me. It has a lot of good information and details on processes, what food product stores which way best and for how long but I can't use the recipes."
3,Not too bad of a book,"If you need to learn things it's a great book, but I was looking for something with a little more recipes in it. All in all it's not too bad of a book."
4,Perserving Summer's Bounty,"I went back to canning for the first time in years (and years). I had this as one of my start up books. It has some decent recipes and if you're strating out, it is a good book to have on your shelf. I canned my fisrt batch using this book - I had forgotten how much space you can end up using if you are not organized so don't be like me, be a bit more methodical about setting up. Enjoy -"
4,Easy simple straightforward directions,"Good, easy to use, easy to read directions. 2nd year gardener, and this year I won't have to throw away any extras, and will be able to enjoy the goodies long after the winter begins!"
4,Good for the Price,Runs most Sims and RPGs full FX with no problems or stalls. Came up with 300 watts. No ill fxs so far.
3,Far from the best Ray compilation,"While containing some essential hits (available elsewhere), this compilation also contains some of the worst records that Johnnie was forced to make under the ""guidance"" of Mitch Miller (of whom Johnnie once commented, ""Mitch had no idea how to record me""). If you are a Ray completist who simply must hear ""Texas Tambourine,"" go directly to the two box sets on Bear Family."
5,Eye Opener,"I've followed Michael around on his lecture circuit, and recently had a chance to read this book. Michael does an excellent job of exposing the ""free"" media for what it really is. He goes into detail on the censorship of newspapers, journalists, and the ridiculous right wing slant that is prevalent in the news today.Some of his viewpoints are a little sketchy, but most of them hit home and make a terrible amount of sense. I can safely say that Michael has made a believer out of me. I look forward to reading his other books."
5,The Blackshoepirate,"Michael Parenti does what so many of the popular liberal writers can not seem to do. He speaks directly to the common man. His prose and cadance are in tune with the way an average Joe like me thinks and uses the english language. In regards to this book, he has brought to life the reasons why a person from the blue collar ranks should begin to look again at the crap spewing out of the TV set. It is one thing to hear that Faux News is biased but another to read, in detail, how the entire mainestram media including the entertaining aspect is skewed towards the interest of the corporate conglomerates and not the interest of an average auto mechanic like myself.This was the second 4th of Mr. Paranti's works that I read. By now I have read them all. I encourage you all to do the same."
3,"second dog ""zeus"" dutch?","The first canine was mutch better, more fun. In this movie there is a second dog a dobberman called ""Zeus"" This dog is trained in the Netherlands and only understand the language Dutch. But why in godsname are they talking german to the dog! I think thats why they could not subtitle that part! It was a near thing or all the people in Europe had to speak German"
1,Horrible,"This movie was awful, please reconsider buying it and rent it first. You will be glad you only spent a couple of bucks at blockbuster rather than wasting much more to own it."
3,The Dog is Great...,"I had a lot of fun watching this movie, as I would watching any silly movie involving a funny dog. That's pretty much all this movie is, but, that's why we watch this type of movie, isn't it? Jerry Lee is a little older now, with the gray muzzle to prove it, but he still does his job and takes care of his also older partner. He's a great dog actor, too. This is a fun and funny movie for dog lovers. That's about the best recommendation I can give, but that's what I was looking for, so I would have to say this movie worked for me."
3,K-911 Not up to the original,"I bought this based on reviews that said it was better than the original, which I really enjoyed - WRONG. It was sad to see John Belushi get old and in poor shape (I really think he was not just acting out of shape), and Jerry Lee is not the same dog. I know dog's get old fast, so maybe they couldn't use the original Jerry Lee, but they could have done a much better job of casting the dog. Jerry Lee he is NOT! The writing suffers from many plot holes, not the least of which is the failure to explain Tracy's death or even tie it into the movie. They try to make it funny, but this one fails to measure up. it's only for small kids under the age of 12. Anyone older will see right through it."
4,exactly as ordered,This item arrived exactly as ordered in the time specified. I'm happy to have found this movie to give as a Christmas gift to someone who had the first movie. Thank you!
1,Deceptive picture,"I purchased this product as I was looking for a hinge. When I did a search, option showed up. I believed I was purchasing this entire set; though I only needed the hinge. The only thing I received was the backstrip."
1,Very Poor,"This is just lined paper bound together. I was very disappointed. I thought it would have itinerary area, etc., but it didn't. Yes, I could write in my itinerary, but I like it to already have printed the date, leave, arrive, etc. I could get a spiral bound notebook for a lot less than this and accomplish the same thing. Get a different travel journal. This one is no good."
2,Not much more than a notebook,"I have bought travel journals before, and this one is alot less than what I expected. No titled pages for hotels, restaurants or expenses...just blank pages with lines to write on. Like I said, just a notebook with a pretty title. Not recommended."
4,MSI US54G USB STICK,Good product in general.Installation is very easy!!.Good signal reception.WPA support!!.Inexpensive.It lacks a disconnection option.
5,"Best book to ""understand"" relativity","I read many books about the Twin Paradox and this one clearly explains the trip in detail, including the clock reading when the brother is leaving, turn-around and back from the journey. To me, relativity is truely amazing and this book can describe the true ""meaning"" of it. Highly recommended."
5,Very good,Hey! This is a really good prog band. Maybe the best in Europe.1 star?! You're just kidding Pablo.
2,Incredibly tedious tale,"Onceinto this book one encounters the ancient ""document"" that triggers the adventure, first in supposed translation, then in seemingly unending pages describing the purported original Greek, letter by letter naming each in English capitals enclosed in curly braces. To pursue this to a resumption of the narrative one must sit endlessly pressing the ""next page"" bar without enlightenment. I am certain that to derive meaning from this one must both read and write Greek, provided that the purported writing does indeed say what the ""translation"" has already said. I saw no way to skip over this and abandoned the tale. It is worth the price at most."
3,A very scary book,"I found this book VERY freaky. I listened to the unabridged recording of it, and I am glad, beacuse the lengthy descriptions would have been VERY hard for me to cope with. The setting in this book is one of things that unnerved me the most. To begin with, having a man who was near to death enter the scene to give some incredibly...different...instructions certainly adds to the suspense. The setting in northern Africa and the customs of teh Amahager(sp) are very scary and,um, not very pleasant to listen too. Despite these things I have enjoyed She and I think that an abridged version would be a better choice to read."
3,Quite a story!,"This is quite an adventure story, well worth reading. I first read this one when I was in the sixth grade, and after re-reading it at age 53 I still liked it. That is not always true when one visits the books one liked as a lad.This is the story of three Englishmen who, following the dictates of the family legend of one of them, set out to Central Africa to find the lost land of Imperial Kor. What they find is an isolated tribe ruled by an immortal, supernaturally beautiful woman. More would be telling, but this is a good yarn that most readers will enjoy.Haggard's writing style is a product of his time, and is somewhat dense and archaic by modern standards, but is not bad for all that. He has some of the dialog in the novel use Old English phraseology which was archaic even in his day, and it made some of the novel somewhat hard to read, at least for me. But these are minor quibbles; this is a fine novel that will hold the interest of most readers."
5,Movie Material,"What a book! How many movies, and scenes, and other books have been spawned from this one. Some scenes have been duplicated exactly, like the marching army of skeletons and the chasm with the leap over two projecting stones. Steven Spielberg is intimately acquainted with this novel. I'm surprised that he hasn't made it into his own film. It's a terrific read, written when Haggard was not quite 30, and it's underlying theme is death. What is it? What does man's life mean? What of religion? All kinds of unanswerable questions are pondered in the course of this thriller. And Love. No wonder it has endured. What an imagination Haggard must have possessed! There are two subsequent books where Ayesha somehow returns. It is in her character that we see the young Haggard, dreaming of the perfect woman."
4,Archetype of the collective unconcious,"There was a reason that this was a novel that intrigued Freud, who called it ""A strange book, but full of hidden meaning"". She, like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Dracula, Sherlock Holmes, Frankenstein, Peter Pan and a similar select company of works of popular fiction, works on a concious level of fantasy adventure narrative and multiple other levels of meaning, in this instance involving race, colonialism, sexuality, 19th Century anxieties, etc. While totally un-PC (so be warned if the books you read need support 21st Century views of the third world and women)it has a wonderful dreamlike feel that taps into a collective unconcious of symbols and archetypes. Besides which, it's a good read."
3,This was a re-read,I read this book many years ago. It has not aged well. I had forgotten how much of the book was about the authors views and how little actually on the action taking place.
2,"Good story, frustrating read.","GREAT story, WORST formatting EVER. I could hardly get through the book with all the question marks. The story was great, one of Haggard's greats, but I just got so frustrated. Instead, download your free kindle book from here: […] The Gutenberg project formats everything precisely and cleanly and your read will be hassle free!"
1,no good,fit fine but output voltage is too high. 15.8 to be exact. gonna return it. what a pain!!!! yes im annoyed!!!
5,Escaflowne is perfect and impeccable in every way (Revised),"Finally, it's here: the Escaflowne Perfect Collection. I can't wait to see the uncut version of this perfect Anime show that everyone is buzzing about. It's got mecha, drama, romance, a little bit of comedy, sci-fi, and mystery all in one. If that doesn't appeal to you enough, the fights and human drama from the experience of main characters (aka Hitomi Kanzaki and the gang) will always keep you at the edges of your seat. What's more, the music and composition by Yuko Kanno and Maaya Sakamoto will put you within a surreal atmosphere. All in all, this is an impeccable, perfect Anime show in every way whenever you look at it. Period.Everyone should put this 5 out of 5 stars Anime show into his or her collection. See you later!"
3,Meh,"My sister wanted this for Christmas. I got it for her. She didn't like it. If you've seen it before and liked it... then get it. If you haven't, she's telling you that you won't like it."
1,A good buy for what I paid.,I believe this story however long but I do not it should be amended. It has a interesting story line and I will enjoy keeping it in my collection.
2,Escaflowne the series,"The first Escaflowne I experienced was the movie (Which was great). Then I read the comic book series (And that was awesome!!!). Then I saw the series and sank.... I was expecting the same action packed storyline with twists and cool characters as the comic books. But it seems that the anime series was the prototype for the real story. Not only does the anime series and comic book series have different views on what the characters look like, but it is missing some of the great twists and events that the comic book storyline has in it. Then I realized that the comic book was made AFTER the series instead of BEFORE.I believe that the anime series not only has some of the worst animation I have ever seen, but definitaly the worst voice acting I have ever heard (English Audio).If you really want the GOOD Escaflowne experience instead of the AVERAGE one, Watch the movie then read the comic books and totally ignore the TV series. In other words, Don't waste your time watching it."
5,Escaflowne is beautiful,"I watched this series when it was on Fox Kids and also on YTV in Canada. It was fabulous then, and I never missed an episode. This DVD set takes the cake, because it gives you the full uncut version of the show in all its glory. You will bond with the characters as they make their journey through Gaea, in mecha battles, multiple relationships (friendship and love) and the struggle with inner conflict and personal morality. It is simply a well-animated and intriguing series that will keep you glued from start to finish. And at the end, you'll be left wanting much more."
5,Emotional Release,"I had only vaguely heard of ""Escaflowne"" before I saw the movie in a store. It was on sale so I bought it and: WOW DAAM! I was so impressed that I went online to look up any information about the series. I eventually discovered that it was a series and was convinced that buying it would make me feel much better. :P It did, indeed. This series, although not the fairy tale like my sentimental heart enjoys, is one of the most beautiful animes that I have ever seen. It has a bittersweet ending, but in the end, the viewer realizes that that was the only logical and beautiful way to end the story. It has so much symbolism and philosophy mixed in that it's hard NOT to pay attention to. ""Vision of Escaflowne"" is a beautiful series that will pull at your mind and heart and never let go. I seldom watch an entire anime show the entire way through more than once, but I am proud to say that ""Escaflowne"" will be watched over and over and over again. I loved this series."
3,Third Album Lacks the Flavor of His Debut,"Es Mundial is El General's third album, and signals a departure from the reggae vibe that made him Panama's best-known artist. It's an interesting CD in that ig signals an evolution of an artist not afraid to try new things; from the Merengue track ""Las Chicas"" to the Banda version of the same cut. Poema is an unusual throwback to the 1989 flows of Mellow Man Ace, unfortunately the track seems out of place on what is otherwise a dance album.The best (and most popular) track on the album is ""Rica y Apredatita"", the first single from the album, and certainly radio-friendly. The futbol-anthem ""Latinos a Ganar"" has more of the feel of his sophomore effort El Poder, and is a must-have track for any soccer aficionado.Not his best album, but far from his worst, Es Mundial represents an artist willing to try new things. If you're a huge fan of his first album, don't expect this album to be a step in the same direction."
5,The best guide to Machine Quilting,"After purchasing this book I read it cover to cover. I found the tips most helpful, especially the tips on thread, needle and tension adjustments. I was immediately able to apply the techniques to a quilt I was working on and I was amazed at the rapid improvement in my skills. I have only been machine quilting about 3 or 4 years now and this book helped me make the biggest improvement jump in a short period of time. By the way, that quilt I was working on...it took the blue ribbon at this year's state fair!"
4,Excellent guide,"This book is an excellent guide for all levels of machine quilters. It includes lots of clear and understandable advice, pictures, practice projects, hints and product advice. I had borrowed it from my local library and decided I needed to own one. I refer to it a lot and it has been a great help."
1,Excellent resourse,I was introduced to this author in a free motion quilting class and find this book to be a wonderful resourse to get any and every question answered.
1,flat and boring!,"The story is flat and the main character Tag does absolutely nothing in the adventure. He is not exactly a hero or an animal you can understand or feel along with. Several things in the book are not explained and stay vague throughout the end, like why are the queen and king so important and who are they? For me, reading this book was a big disappointment. I saw people make comparisons, but it is in no way like Tolkien and it doesn't even come close to the quality of Tad Williams' 'Tailchaser's Song'. I will NOT buy the sequel, the golden cat - that tells you something about The Wild Road! I can strongly recommend Tailchaser's Song which has a similar storyline, but is worked out so much better with characters that will really touch you."
3,"Wonderful cat characters, overkill in areas","The cats in this book are real cats. The mystical elements it proposes concern their history and their ability to travel the Wild Roads of the title. If you like cats, you'll love the way these talk and think.The villain is very vaguely drawn, and the first part of the book is hard to understand. Tag's viewpoint is used: that of a young, inexperienced kitten. Once he learns a little, and meets some of his friends, interesting individual stories begin to emerge & the persistent reader is rewarded.A bit monotonous on the horrid weather, how hungry and skinny everyone is, and how valliantly they fight, but the quest formula works. There are riches to be found here."
3,"Disturbing, but interesting","I read ""The Golden Cat"" BEFORE I read ""The Wild Road"" and even though reading ""Wild Road"" cleared up all my questions from the second book, ""Golden Cat"" was the better-written of the two novels. It's as if King found his balance in the second book.However, I must say that the concepts raised are disturbing, and the symbolism of the ""green fire"" mentioned in various parts is vague. The book is often very sad, with the images of animal experimentation, and it would be nice to balance the story by having some decent humans in it. The Magicou has selected Tag, and although Magicou is impatient with the young cat not ""catching on"" to what he is teaching him, I can relate to Tag's bewilderment because the teaching's aren't at all well-presented. Cy is a great character, as well as Mousebreath, and Sealink definitely comes into her own in the second volume. Good, strong characters and dialogue carry the story in spite of the obtuse plot of what the Alchemist hopes to achieve."
1,Extreme dislike,"I loved ""Tailchaser's Song"" by Tad Williams (although I did read it as a teen) and I like cats, so I thought I'd try this cat-character fantasy novel. I really did not like it. I read it to the end because I kept thinking ""maybe it will get better and it will all have been worth it"". But no. The main cat character was very juvenile and annoying. He is a young cat, so maybe his characteristics were ""realistic"", but it was still annoying. The whole ""wild roads"" concept was extremely strange and just not ""believable"" fantasy. A fantasy world needs to be built up in such a way that the reader is drawn in and finds the world believable and compelling. This was not the case for me. I scanned a few of the reviews and several people seemed to really like the book, so maybe it is a ""loved it"" or ""hated it"" book. I am still searching for a quality ""Tailchaser's Song"" or ""Watership Down"" type book. I would not recommend this book."
2,A book you CAN put down,"This book is, well... all I can say is FLAT. The plot is too hyped up, the characters flatter than a pancake (and just as interesting as one), and the whole thing just monotonous beyond belief. I love fantasies AND cats, and thought this would be a good one, but... well, I have to admit I put it aside many a time to re-read other novels of mine. This was ONE SLOW READ."
3,Interestering Book,"As with The Golden Cat, Gabriel King, gives us the ""road"". Read this book before The Golden Cat to find some insight into the fantasy road that cats travel. It can be confusing at times, but a very interestering story."
4,A Really Nice Book,"I really enjoyed this book, and its sequel. Anyone who likes fantasy and cats would also."
4,A Purrfect Read!,"This definitely belongs in the hall of fame of animal tales, alongside Watership Down and Tailchaser's Song. Gabriel King shows a mastery of characterization, flowing storytelling, and beautiful imagery. His poetic descriptions, such as the sunlight investigating everthing it came in contact with on the boat Guillemot, before curling up like a cat, left me in awe. The ending of the battle between the Majicou and the Alchemist recalled the eternally battling dragons from Arthurian legend."
3,"Talking cats. And magical roads. Somehow, they go together.","It's a decent book. I usually enjoy books with talking animals, so I liked it well enough, but it's no where near my favorite. For those who've read things like this before and enjoy them, it's probably worth reading. For everyone else, read something better in the genre-- if you read this one first, you'll probably end up hopelessly confused. The characters are cute, but the plot line is as twisted and jumbled as the thoughts in the character Cy's head. I enjoyed it, and it's always neat to see a different type of perspective in fantasy, but it could have been written much better."
3,Good Character Development,"Good Things: Enchanting characters, interesting situations and a good 'quest type' theme.Criticism: This novel has some great character development. However, the over-reliance on magic and the alternatively ridiculous/horrific villian made it hard to take seriously at times. Some parts were vague and lacked direction. The purpose of the cats quest seemed lost amidst other underlying sub-plots.Book would've been better with a tighter plot and less reliance on the supernatural.."
3,"Eh, could be a -lot- better...","First off, go hit the library if you want to read this book. Don't bother wasting the [$] the used book store will charge you. The story is only worth one read-through, even though the plot isn't bad.What hit me with this book, and it's sequil was the writing style itself. Neither the store, nor the charactors managed to snag my interest, yet on looking back they -should- have.Good for one read-through, and only if you like cats. ^_~"
2,"Eh, I'm not impressed.","Not a bad book, by any means, but not a very captivating one either. Had to make myself sit down and read it just to get finished. Not something I plan on re-reading anytime soon, so it's off to the used book store with this copy!Might be nice as a Library read, but I wouldn't recommend buying it. Even if you -really- like cats..."
2,Disorganized technical reading...,"Although this book has accurate technical content, the organization is ill-thought and amounts to little more than numerous papers stapled together under a pretty cover."
4,A good early Verdi opera.,"This is a must for lovers of Verdi opera. Beautifully recorded, solidly and stirringly conducted. Good soloists. Raimondi is an especially fine Hun."
2,Just OK,"First, there's no libretto included with this CD, so if you don't already have one, you'll be lost. The sound is only marginal and it appears to be a live recording (or there were some noisy people coughing in the background - no applause howerver). There are damn few recordings of Attila available, so you have to take what you can get but I'd be happier with a full-priced, more-professional version."
4,Gaiting problems,I enjoyed the video and it has helped me with my 4 yo walker to the extent of training a young horse to gait. It helped me realize I was requiring him to be collect prior to him gaiting well in a loose rein. It helped me figure out what I was doing wrong by requiring him to collect and gait before he was ready. I wish the video would have been more instructional such as giving close up shots of the exact bits they were using. I also think I would have gotten more out of the video if I had watched Part I because they made reference to certain parts of that video which then lost me. I would definetly recommend this video for walker owners who are having pacey horses or need tips to get your horse to become more supple.
2,Poor design of basket.,The basket on this Mr. Coffee does not fit tight and swings open letting grounds and coffee run all over. The grounds also get in to the coffee carafe. Very poorly designed.
2,Read before buying,"This is my third Mr Coffee machine. Each one has had something minor go wrong. All three did have the problem of the material covering the heating plate come off and all spilled coffee when poring. This last one (which is this model) is now starting to go bad. I've had it only 7 1/2 months and the time setting buttons are getting stuck and now for some reason the delay brew no longer works. I know this one says it the best desgined yet, but they still haven't gotten it right. Will now just go back to Krups."
5,Buy this if you like to thrash!,"This CD is in excellent condition. I highly recommend it as it brings back a lot of memories. Sacrifice is truly one of the best thrash metal bands ever. They are right up there with old Slayer music and Wehrmacht. It came wrapped, sealed, and delivered quickly. I thought I would never see this LP, which has many more added tracks, ever again. It was worth every cent."
3,Way cheesier than I remembered,"I remember seeing this movie when I was younger so I was really excited to watch it again now that I am in my 30's. It brought back memories but man, this movie was cheesy. $2.99 was a steal since no other place had this movie available and it finally quench my desire to rewatch it so many years later."
3,Quality ok,Looks like a copy from a VHS. Haven't seen this movie in years and wanted to add it to my collection.
1,AWFUL...EXCEPT,"The two previous reviews are correct: this movie was worse than bad. I was one of the unfortunate people who shelled out money to see it when it came out in limited release in 1988. The plot is ridiculous, the acting even worse. The one funny part is when Ms. Davis' stepdaughter looks at a picture of her late mother and says ""Oh Mom, you were so good."" The woman in the picture is none other than Joan Crawford !!!!"
1,Sad chaos,"This film was Davis' last, which she left after filming for only one week and after she saw the resulting footage. Viewing the result, one can see why she left, and it isn't because the film is bad. Davis here looks haggard and old, and can barely walk or speak intelligibly any longer. The camera can no longer hide how ill she really was when this was made. It is cruelly obvious. She still manages to be magnetic and throw off sparks, however, even while standing still. The picture, a botched jumble, is memorable for only one thing: a final Davis signature line, addressed stumblingly, but with something of the old Davis clipped delivery, to a dog: ""Are YOU a ve-ge-tar-i-an, too?"""
1,Top 100 Worst Film List,"Widely considered one of the most atrocious films of the 20th Century, `Wicked Stepmother' lives up to all expectations. Davis apparently wanted the repugnant script altered before shooting commenced but director Larry Cohen refused and Davis left some weeks after shooting began, leaving Cohen to piece together the film with the already shot fragments. Davis died before the film was released."
2,Burning One Just For You,Long time I was looking for this DVD. Came in the mail and I opened it up and what's that smell. Wow. Freshly burned DVD. Had to throw the case out as it smelled so bad. Took a while for the DVD to stop smelling. Using a slow speed disk on a high speed burn usually causes excessive heat. Not sure if that was what happened here. Video quality is not what I expected. I wonder if it is a VHS to DVD burn?...as I have tried conversion of a VHS tape. The DVD doesn't look good on a high resolution screen.
5,"Entertaining, hilarious, exciting!","I found ""Wicked Stepmother"" to be a delightful and entertaining movie. The special effects are good and funny. I rate this movie with 5 stars because of its humor and lack of seriousness. The only negative is that the movie seems relatively short, but still deserves a 5 star rating because of its humor."
3,TWO Performances that make STEPMOTHER,"Much has been said that Bette Davis is the only reason to watch WICKED STEPMOTHER. The film is not very good, but it does have some amusing bits, most notably the portraits of Joan Crawford as the first wife struck me funny. There is also another performance worth mentioning: film legend, Evelyn Keyes (of ""Gone With The Wind"", ""Here Comes Mr. Jordan"" and ""Seven Year Itch"" fame). She offers a classy performance as the instructor of witchcraft that Coleen Camp seeks."
2,Wicked Indeed....Wickedly Bad!,"Okay let me just state, I'm not a negative person...I love Bette Davis...and was excited to see this finally on DVD. A half hour into the flick, my excitement quickly waned...it was so cheesy...it was badly edited and the storyline wasn't that great...I feel for Bette having her name associated with this...mind you it was filmed around her stroke so she's only in it for about half of it but still...I'm just thankful it was cheesy so I could have some wine to make the time pass better...sorry but it deserved that cheesy line!"
1,"Watch For Bette Davis, And That's All!","This boring, stupid comedy has nothing to offer except thelimited appearence of Bette Davis. The plot is very weak, and Bette Davis definitely showed good judgement by quitting this film. If you are a fan of Bette then you should by all means purchase or rent this film, as it was her last. It's the same deal with Joan Crawford fans buying Trog, as that was her last & definitely worst film. That's the only reason I bought that film & the only reason I bought this one too. . . How odd that the two actresses noted greatly for their excellent films & hatred towards eachother would both end their careers with very poor films. Incidentally this film is worse than Trog, at least that one has some campy value to it and is mildly entertaining. As I said before, this film has only one decent asset to offer: Bette Davis!"
4,Under pressure....get a grip.,"For those interested in grip training, without having to use plates or other methods, these provide a nice and convenient alternative. Overall, pleased with the product. Most people probably do not have a good sense of what 150/200 pounds of force is in relation to grip. Would recommend starting around 100/150 and go up from there. An increase of 50 pounds in tension is quite noticeable. Hence, give it time to notice significant changes in grip strength. Also, consider alternative ways of holding the grip and rotate the position of the gripper in the hand. Also, closing the grip and trying to sustain is also a good method of building strength. These are easy to store and use. Grip is stable and have not had any of the issues with handle rotations mentioned by another reviewer."
4,Good product,"good product, but I over estimated my strength when i got this. I recommend the 150 lb to start with"
5,A book that will make ancestor hunter's stop and laugh!,"This book will bring back memories of stomping through cemeteries, days spent in hot musty libraries, and the days you waited anxiously for the mailman. A book geared to the lighter side of genealogy!"
2,Book is obsolete,"This book had some entertaining sections, but written 30 years ago has very obsolete search ideas and also very Un-PC comments. It's not staying in my library. I'll give it to a used-book sale."
1,Straight to the salon for help!!,"This product is HORRIBLE! It leaves your hair dull and lifeless and drier than you can imagine. My hair is actually mushy, if you can imagine that. It takes the same amount of time to straighten as it did before, but when straight it looks frizzy. Also, wearing it curly is not an option anymore- do not ever use this product!"
4,Saved my hair,"I have fought with natural curly/frizzy hair all my life. I have tried everything in the world to either get my hair to curl or be straight and noithing as worked until now. It was a little frizzy at first but after adding a bit of styling oil to it, it is smooth and straight and healthy looking now, and takes only five minutes to style."
2,"Straightening system doesn't work, but the iron is great.","I have very thick, curly, frizzy hair. After spending the necessary time to get the system into my hair and brush, brush, brush it in, I ended up taring tons of hair out. Then after all that hard work, my hair still looked curly and frizzy. Then the straightening with the flat iron took about 2.5 hours. Now, my hair is straight frizz.. even after applying the leave in conditioner. For people with thick curly hair I would say ""DON'T DO IT"". Now I'm looking into investing my $$$ in a professional flat iron instead of these bogus products."
3,Customer service ... what customer service?????????????,"This stuff worked ok on my hair but this company was terrible to deal with. Five months later and I'm still trying to get them to send it out on time and get the order right the first time. I've called dozens of times and have just gotten the runaround from every single person I spoke with. If you want pretty straight hair in the looney bin, try it but I guarantee their customer service will drive you absolutely crazy!!! There have to be better products out there from companies who care about their customers. If you know of any, pleeeeeeeeeeeease let me know! I'm done with these guys!"
2,Not that Great,"I decided to try this product after my cousin claimed she had excellent results and found it was not all that great. It definitely did a lot of damage to my hair. My hair was slightly straighter then average, but it still took the same amount of time to straighten my hair as it usually would. I would not buy this product again. I think it just depends of what kind of hair you have. I have wavy/curly hair. My cousin has really curly/nappy hair."
3,Not that bad,"This product was pretty. I love flat straight hair and for the first time got it. My hair is puffy and with lots of volume no matter what I do. It damaged my hair a little bit, it looked dull but I put all sorts of leave in condicioners and finishes to stop looking dry and dull. I would buy it again, I have not found any other product that will live my hair so flat and straight."
1,Horrible Product,"Like the the other reviewers, I also bought into the pitch. I have curly hair and after using the product was left with damaged frizzy hair. It was neither straight nor curly. It took longer after applying this product to style my hair. Using this product only damaged my hair. My hair was left feeling so fraigle. This product made my hair break ofF . This was a complete waste of money."
1,What's next... skin whitener?,"This product and the message behind it absolutely stinks. I have curly, fabulous hair and there's no reason for me or anyone else to think that having straight hair is more beautiful or professional. This is got to be one of the most racist and culturally insensitive infomercials I have ever seen on tv and feeds into popular stereotypes of what ""beautiful"" looks like in our society."
5,Tamika is truly annointed!,This CD is uplifting and inspirational. I am proud to call her my friend and little sister.She has a gift of song that is an undeniable blessing to every ear that hears. Praise the name of Jesus!
5,mistake,it's a lovely surreal movie except the drawings are from early iranian paintings and NOT russian!
4,Fast reading but a distanced perspective,"You may need a glossary for this book if you're not familiar with such terms as ejido or hacendado. I highly reccomend doing some preparation reading on the mexican revolution before starting this book. Be advised, a third of this book is notes and references! The author does a good job of showing how Zapata remained committed to his cause while many around him were traitors. The author provides factual accounts with little embelishing or unsupported speculation. This book is a must-have for those who are interested in the real Zapata."
3,It's kind of hot in here...,"...even for pianists. Leopold Godowski may be best known for his part with Mischa Elman in one of the great musical anecdotes of all time concerning the debut of Jascha Heifetz. But for him to compose variations on Chopin - better he should have just played Chopin. I bought this CD after hearing one Godowski variation on ""Performance Today,"" but I have to say that listening to this whole collection, I just wished I could have had my Chopin pure."
2,died too soon,"Got this unit and it worked fine for 2 years, but with VERY moderate use. I may have played 3-5 discs a week during that time in the unit. Almost 2 years exactly to the date of installation, the CD player died (it would not eject the disc). With the very light usage I gave this unit, that is not acceptable."
5,You Gotta Try This!,Besides being the best tasting whey protein I have ever tasted Designer Whey Protein is two to three times as effective in a weight loss program than regular whey proteins!Why? Because no other protein shake that I know of is loaded with B vitamins like Designer Whey. B vitamins reduce stress. Stress produces Cortisol. Cortisol increases weight gain.If you want to lose weight Designer Whey Protein is the Shake to Take!
4,Serves its purpose!,"I'm a 19 yr old female, I've been using designer whey vanilla for the past two months now, and am pretty satisfied with the results. Not only that- the flavor isn't too bad, feels nuetral to me so I don't really get tired of it. Although everyone has their different taste.Also- instead of using one of those on-the-go shakers, I just pour the powder into a 12oz spring water bottle and mix it w/ water after I'm done at the gym. I shake it for about 15-20 seconds and it mixes really well! I recommend that because a lot of those shaker bottles leak.I give it an overall 4 out of 5 because its the only whey protein I've tried- I'm happy with its effects so I'm sticking w/ it."
3,"I use it, but I'm sure there's something else thats better out there","I'm very health conscious. I work out alot. I've been using Whey Protein for years. I've tried different kinds and I have yet to find one that amazes me. This one tastes ok. It doesn't mix very well, unless you use a blender.However, when I use it, I do notice a difference in my muscle tone. I feel that it works. I'm not disappointed with this product, but at the same time, I'm not gonna sit here and say that this product is the best either."
5,Great Morning Start,"Designer Whey - Aria Women's Protein Vanilla, 12 oz powder This drink is a wonderful morning jump start for a low carb/low cholesterol diet. Mix 30cc (one oz) each of the chocolate designer whey and vanilla aria blended in 8 oz. of cold water. Makes a tasty smoothie.Janet C."
2,"Bad mixing, unpleasant flavor (natural)","Although it sounds a little silly to criticize the flavor of the ""plain"" whey, I have to say that compared to the other flavorless whey types I've tried, Designer Whey Natural has a distinctly unpleasant aroma and taste. My morning outmeal tastes vaguely rancid with Designer Whey Natural. But, a far worse problem is its mixability. Compared to the other whey supplements I've tried, Designer Whey is by far the worst. Short of actually blending in a blender, mixing it by hand or in a shaker results in a mixture that is a gritty, lumpy mass. If you are looking for an easy-to-use, non-flavored whey, skip Designer Whey in favor of something like Any-Whey."
1,Poor save your money,"I purchased this saw assuming that being a Powermatic it would be good quality and well made.The table is ground so poorly the out of flatness is measurable with tape measure.The rails that the fence rides on are bowed 3/16 and 1/8 inch new ones are supposedly on the way.Lots of the hardware was missing.Large burrs and poor machining on all theoretically flat surfaces.Calls to the tech line have resulted in inconsistent specs on how flat thetable should be with specs varying from .015 ""(no chance its that flat) to.036""that is slightly more than1/32""and yes it is at least that warped.Grizzly and Woodtech can hold tighter tolerances according to the magazines.I strongly recomend against this product.Wish I had saved 4 or 5 hundred bucks and purchased someone elses table saw kit.The router lift is awesomely well made and works perfecly Jessem and their tech line I rate very highly"
1,"Update from my last review""Poor Save Your Money""","I have now been fighting and despising this saw for years. See my last review '04. I have received two fence rail sets from the manufacturer, they have all been as bent as the ones furnished with the machine. I have been told by Powermatic's tech line that I would not notice the lack of flatness of the table, I do notice it. I have replaced the belt with a link belt and tuned the saw so it was vibration free and cutting accurately to .006"". by the next morning things had shifted and I had to reset the fence. A Forrest blade only served to highlight the inacuracies of the saw. I plan on either reinforcing the trunnion,reinforcing the stand, reengineering the mobile base as well as the fence, and surface grinding the table, or selling the unit. I would strongly suggest purchasing a different saw from this one. The precision afforded by this saw can be duplicated by a mid priced portable. The router lift is very nice and works well."
5,This Book Rocked!!!,"This book was great, I loved it. It took me about a day to read it, but it was well worth every hour. This book was touching and it stole my heart. I got in to every role, the people in this book were extremely passionate about what they did."
4,"WONDERFUL, POWERFUL STUFF THAT ROMANCE IS MADE OF!","Dax and Califa are different people who started out on different sides of the coalition. She is now a slave and he, the pirate of the skies and mortal enemy of all that Califa once stood for, holds the controller.But desire and love has a funny way of creeping up on them when they least expect it. Justine Davis writes another powerful story that fairly crackles with undercurrents of desire, anger and revenge. Do not miss it!!"
5,"After this, I will read anything this woman writes!","The tragic hero was one of the best character portrayals I've read, and I am very picky about these things. I hope Justine Davis continues with this group of characters and builds on them. The futuristic setting is intriguing, and her character development is first rate"
2,This movie ASPIRED to be a B movie ...,"... and it didn't quite get there. Fortunately, I watched it for free on TV ... but it cost me time in my life that I can never recover ... far too expensive!"
2,Sent it back.,"I was not happy with this keyboard and sent it back for a refund. The quality was not what I expected for this style of keyboard, and the keys were mushy. The cord is too thick and is hard to route on your desk. And for whatever reason, the PS/2 connector is as fat as the original-style AT connector at the plug base. If your motherboard has the mouse and keyboard PS/2 ports right next to one another, the plug size can make it difficult to connect. You can find much better keyboards for half the price elsewhere."
3,Disappointing,"After the first two cuts, this CD tapers off. The lyrics aren't that great, and the band sounds a little generic."
2,puzzle Silvia Malagugini,"I don't know this singer, but I am loocking for the song MARE MAJE Funerary song from slavia and Italy from XVI century."
2,Uninspired at best.,"Listen carefully to ""Black Glue"" and then go listen to ""Cupid's Dead"" by Extreme and you'll be shocked. He simply took most of the licks then slowed it down considerably. Even the tone is the same. I have no respect for someone who lifts a large chunk of someone else's work and then passes it off as their own.I originally rated this a 1 but I've since changed it to a 2. Also, I was wrong in my original review. Mike doesn't really sound like Nuno. Nuno was tight, precise and had a ripping technique. Mike's playing is simply lackluster, often cluttered and average, IMHO.Still, since someone asked me to reconsider my original review, I complied and my final judgment (songwriting, guitar tone, ideas, technique, etc., considered) I rate this a 2.TS"
4,This book really got stronger with each page!!,"It started a little slow for me - I did not expect to get so drawn in as I was by these two Leah and Devon. But by the time he had birthed her baby and willed them both to live - and they did I was so caught up in Devon. What a warm, sentimental caring man this rake turned out to be. And, did I say forgiving, because he certainly had more than most men to forgive of Leah. Of course at that point you do not realize how important being a father to baby Ben is to Devon. These two people just might have been destined to be together - their families at odd for years - and this baby brings them together. This really is a several hanky book by the end. Leah and Devon are a special couple and you really do feel their passion and their love!!"
5,A Scandalous Marriage,"I loved this book, it was really good. It was alot better then her previous book. It shows that even people whose relatives are enemies can find happiness together. I rate this book as keeper. The story line hids the truth till the very end."
2,"Such Potential, but fell short...","I'm sorry to say, this book just wasn't that interesting. It started out promising but fizzled quickly."
3,Use of flashbacks is brave -- but doesn't work,"This book starts out after the hero and heroine have already met and endured scandal. The reader learns more through a series of flashbacks. Though I appreciated the experiment in form, this was off-putting for me.I felt that I never got to know the characters -- especially Leah, the heroine. She did many interesting, even scandalous, things, but I never knew why.Also, many important events happen off stage. Later in the novel, some events that could be important fizzle out.Regretfully, I gave this book a C at All About Romance."
1,Incredibly boring,"I had all to do to finish reading this book. I didn't connect with either characters in the book and had to force myself to finish it. I have read a few other Cathy Maxwell books and found them enjoyable, but this one was a disappointment. I thought Devon was a flop for a hero and Leah wasn't much better."
5,Wonderful story,I loved this book and everything about it. I found Devon to be a wonderful character and Leah to be charming. I highly recommend this beautiful story.
2,A Scandalous Laugh,"As we enter the world of Leah and Devon, we learn of their simply SHOCKING secrets and their love just not meant to be. (gasp!) If you want a good laugh, this is the book for you. The love between Leah and Devon is extremely dramatic and similar to a soap opera. Leah is the typical helpless lead, weeping and swooning in the tan muscular arms of her macho Devon. Without meaning to be, the drama of this book is extremely comical because it is clichéd and fatuous. My two friends and I read this aloud to each other over the summer, and we rolled on the floor laughing. If you want a serious romance, I would not recommend this. However, if you want a light and humorous read, give ""A Scandalous Marriage"" a try."
3,Acrophet- Corrupt Minds,"Acrophet's first release, Corrupt Minds, is another byproduct of the 80's thrash scene. Although the musicianship is technically excellent, there isn't anything really special enough that separates them out of the generic thrash genre. Overall, the album is pretty good. If you need some music to go break something to, prefferably something large and flamable, this album undoubtedly holds your anthem. Enjoy!"
5,Exactly the same as the Volvo filter for half the price,"Except for the word ""Volvo"" this is the exact same stock filter. It even says made in Austria."
5,Great Bed!!!!!,I ordered this bed for my grandson (2 3/4). I had originally ordered another bed but it was lost in transit. Turns out that the previous events were a godsend as this bed was delivered in 3 days with standard shipping and he loves it! He feels like such a big boy now since he can get in and out of the bed all by himself. A friend assembled the bed in less an hour for me and my grandson even helped. I wouldn't hesitate ordering from them again.
2,"Cute, but won't last through more than one child","This bed is very cute, looks nice, and has lasted about two years. It won't last through another child. The drawer never would line up quite right (one side came out more than the other due to imperfections in manufacturing) and wasn't very sturdy feeling when opening - now it hardly works, though perhaps some new screws could make it feel less flimsy. The slats that go across the bed to hold the mattress are mostly broken - I have placed a board across them to hold the mattress. The wood is soft and has some scratches in it, which I think is to be expected of a wood product and is not *that* noticeable. Unfortunately it just isn't going to make it through another child and all the broken slats are not easily replaced (if at all). Too bad, it is cute otherwise!"
3,Picture is deceiving,"I bought this bed for my one year old. I love how it is solid all the way around, so she doesn't get s chance to get her feet,arms, or legs stuck. However, the pictures the manifacture presents are deceiving. The bed is really small and the mattress is higher than the safety rails. Not worth the 199.99 but it is sturdy and close to the ground."
5,Our Son LOVES This Bed!,"We bought this for our 17 month old son who was starting to try and climb out of his crib. After coming into his room 2 times when he was screaming our names to find him hanging over the edge of his crib, we decided it was time to retire the crib.We picked this bed due to the great price, nice color and good reviews. Our son loves to help me build and put stuff together, so this was no exception. We got the bed in and put it together one Saturday morning and he had a lot of fun helping and then was so excited to lay on it. He helped me push him crib out of his room and he hasn't looked back since.This bed is very sturdy as my wife and I have both sat on the end to read to him or such and it supports out weight without any issue. We don't use the drawer underneath as it's really not very big, but it does hold some of his books if he wants to play with it.We're very excited we picked this bed and even more excited that our toddler loves it!"
4,nice bed but shipping...,Great bed. Our daughter loves it but I wish there were more shipping options. I would have gladly paid more to have it shipped to our home. Not every post office delivers to people's homes. In our area we have to go and get our mail at the post office including large packages. Very inconvenient.
5,JORDAN IS BACK,"I was quite skeptical of this album. I bought Joe McIntyre's and wasn't necessarily pleased. Then with all of the delays that were being put on Jordan's album, I was positive that it was going to be horrible. But I bought it anyway, and I must say ""WOW"", I haven't had an album to hit me so hard in quite a while. Unlike most artists out there today, Jordan sings every song with so much emotion. It's like you understand what he's going through in each and every song. This album definately touches every genre of music out there today. And does it well. I have never been so proud to have been a New Kids fan as I was on May 25th, 1999. Jordan, I wish you continued success in everything you do. I just hope everyone is open-minded to what you have to say because I truly believe that you deserve to be heard."
3,Fair,"I LOVE ""Give It To You"" but the cd as a whole is good but kinda weaker than ""Give It To You"". Sorry Jordan, I still think you're cool, just a little weaker than I thought."
2,Dissapointed - Not enough hits on this album,"I was looking forward with anticipation to Jordan's new release. I was dissapointed in that the album was not nearly as commercial as anything he sang or wrote with NKOTB.As an example, when you hear the song ""I like it that way"" by the BackstreetBoys -- you instantly have to sing along -- and it's incredibly infectious.Jordan's songs on this album lack hits. There is no song on the album you have to listen too again. They are all nice -- but not songs you will be humming along to after you listen to them.The album will sell well, only because his marketing dept. is working overtime and he is getting a lot of air and videotime.Sorry Jordan, I look forward to your next album."
2,JORDAN SLIPS ON SOLO DEBUT.,"Jordan Knights first single ""Give It To You"" is the bomb, and so is the second cut ""A Different Party"", but than the CD falls from there, with weak ballads like ""Separate Ways"" which really has no melody to follow, further more the last cut a remix of ""Give It To You"" destroys the song with a rap medley and slip shot mixing...other than that try his NKOTB bro - Joey McIntyre, HIS album is much stronger than the first single ""Stay the Same"", also McIntyres vocals are much stronger. Sorry Jordan, you came out strong with the first single, and ""A Different Party"" may give you a little more time, but after that this CD fails."
2,Unimpressive and not worth the wait,"If Jordan Knight did not have connections because of his former group, I would bet my bottom dollar that this cd would not be released or find radio play. ""Give It To You"" is simply awful, a highly unimpressive song for the first release (isn't the first release suppose to knock your socks off?). I can see why this song has struggled to even break into the Top 20. Jordan, take my advice, find another producer for your next album or look for another job."
1,nothing distinctive,"Being a talented musician and writer, I have to say this Cd was not worth the money. Most of his songs are flat, with no catchy melody or rythm. The writers need to come up with something that will catch the ear, theres no fizz in the pop."
3,Thoughts...,"This is a pretty good CD, unlinke some other people's opinion listening to a toilet flushing could be compared much better to any Michael Bolton music. I found this to be pretty decent, listening to it kind of makes you feel like a preteen again, which I was when KNOTB first started."
5,I loved it!,I've been a NKOTB fan since I was 15. The Jordan album it great. Every song is beautiful. I hope he makes another album.
5,Shockingly good,"After hearing Joey Mac's new CD I was a little scarred to buy this one, but I did and discovered it's actually good - sorry Joe. As a matter of fact it sounds nothing like anything NKOTB ever put out. His vocals are smooth & captivating. The melodies are amazing and the lyrics are anything but cheezy! There really isn't a bad song on here. Props to Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis for the ""Green Eyed Lady"" sample - it's da bomb! And so is this CD!"
5,wonderfull at all,"you know , i was very excited to hear the new material and i think jordan is very talented ,he has a nice voice ,is very charmer and he catches people with his music. i 'll give it to him"
1,Write your own music.,"I do not own this album myself--I was subjected to it by my sister. As she played me ""Close My Eyes"", I thought, ""Hm. That guitar sounds a lot like Kansas' 'Dust In The Wind'."" But then I heard ""A Different Party"", which, it turns out, rips off an ENTIRE BASSLINE from Sugarloaf's ""Green-Eyed Lady"". Try it yourself here at Amazon--listen to the sample of ""A Different Party"", then go to the ""Best of Sugarloaf"" and listen to the first track. Is any credit given? Of course not. Apparently Jordan subscribes to the Puff Daddy school of ""song-writing"". It's not the ripping-off that bothers me... it's the passing it off as his own. Shame."
1,very weak,give it to you was catchy.Jam&lewis suppling the production on this Beatles/Queen meets Timberland type of song.but aside from that it's 3rd rate George Michael Material.he turns Prince's classic I could never take the place of your man from a rocker to an after hours cocktail lounge song.very dreadful.the guy has a alright voice but this material is way below average and is lacking any kind of feel.
1,Sorry..,"Jordan has nothing on Joey McIntyre. Jordan's vocals are bland and the lyrics are an atrocity. I meant to write this 4 years ago, and oh look - now I have.Stop with the music Jordan, please spare our ears.If you want quality, purchase any one of Joey's [McIntyre] Cds - which are far better then any of the crap Jordan tries to pass off as quality. I'm only sorry I had to give this 1 star, 'zero' wasn't an option."
1,so boring...i sold it as soon as possible,"the song ""give it to you"" was a rather unthoughtful, yet catchy number. however, it proved to be just another stupid pop song. except for one other unmemorable song, this album is unlively drivel, sung by a man who...cannot sing. it was one of the most boring albums i've ever listened to. if there is good r&b, i suggest you look elsewhere."
5,but it,this cd is one of the best i have ever owned. it took me a few listens but now i cant get enough of it. everyone needs to go out and buy it. you will love it!
3,Jordan Knight is looking good,"I was so grossed out by the NKOTB phase, they were all little boy band punks, but Jordan Knights up to date look is great and so are his moves but if you buy the cd you won't see them or him, the only song that i liked was the catchy ""give it to you"" song, overall it didn't impress me and thats the only song that stands out in the entire album."
4,"a music fan from Long Island new york,aug 11,1999","I don't think i'm in the demographic mr.knight's label was focusing on(18-24yrsml),but they got my attention.This album has got to be the sleeper of 1999,from the remix of give it to you,to the ballad close my eyes,mr.knight delivers.If you are going to buy an album of one of the boy bands, before you do check this out and 98 degrees and rising both very much worth your money!!!"
5,We've been waiting for this!!!,"We knew he was gonna be back! He's talent went beyond time and finally he is here to show eveyone ""His Right Stuff"". Thanks Jordan... for all these years!"
3,Not What I Expected,"Well, this CD is not what I expected. I really liked the first single Give It To You and thought that was a great comeback. But the rest of the songs on this album are not as emotional as I'd expected them to be. With maybe the exception of Close My Eyes which is a very beautiful ballad. I don't know, I love Jordan's voice and any song you give to him will be good, but I just think that he can have better songs. Songs that are more ""raw"" and less formulaic."
4,"Jordan, A Great Job!","I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS FOR QUITE SOMETIME NOW.JORDAN IS A GREAT ARTIST, WITH A BEAUTIFUL VOICE . THE TRACKS 3 ,5 ,7 AND REMIX TRACK ON THE CD WERE GREAT . I RECEIVED THE CD AS A BIRTHDAY PRESENT FROM A FRIEND AND I CAN ENSURE YOU IT IS THE SECOND BEST PRESENT I HAVE EVER GOTTEN.(THE FIRST BEING HANGIN' TOUGH ALBUM BY NKOTB)THE FIRST TIME I LISTENED TO THIS CD I GOT GOOSE BUMPS. IT IS JUST SO GREAT. IT REMINDED ME OF THE GOOD OLD TIMES.CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT CD......TILL THEN GOOD LUCK!"
5,Jordan Knight is back,"I haven't heard the whole cd and I don't own it(yet). However, I wanted to say that I love NKOTB I have since the first time I saw them perform in 1989,and I still listen to their music. I am glad though, to see Jordan Knight get back in the spot light agian. He is very talanted and well, very good looking. I hope his new music will bring him to new heights in the music industry and anywhere else his heart desires."
5,Excellent Debut Release,"Jordan's Debut release was an interesting surprise. I was particularly pleased with the cover of Prince's song. It was very well done and it is probably one of my favorite tracks off the album. I would recommend checking out the album, if you haven't already."
5,"I love this CD, and Jordan too! :-)","Give it to you is a great song, and it is about time we hear from the former New Kids! I love them!"
2,Bland,"I've heard everything the puppets released except for three records (forbidden places, monsters, and too high to die), and so far I rank this as their worst effort.It's a much more radio-friendly effort than their earlier works. That in and of itself is not always a bad thing, but this cd really bores me.I guess Automatic Mojo is decent, but I MUCH prefer the version that appears on LIve in Montana. As far as I'm concerned the only essential song on here is Sexy Music.The rest of the album is OK at best. Bad Love and Dry Rain are my least favorite puppets songs ever. How anemic can a chorus get?Instead of Huevos, you should get Meat Puppets II or Out My Way. Live in Montana is also very good, and I also really liked their debut album (although not recommended for beginners, as its incoherent mumble/scream vocals might turn some people off)."
2,"Oh yeah, Party Rock, Wow...snore.","This is the one I could never, ever warm up to. The album sounds like it was written AND recorded in four days, by ZZ Top's little brothers no less. Buncha dumb, more-generic-than-Bad Company rock tunes written for the band to play live and, I imagine, live out their adolescent Rock God fantasies on stage. Sorry, but I'm a pass on this one."
1,Not what I expected.,"I thought from the picture that natural was white but it is actually more like tan. The fabric is notgreat, barely feels like cotton. Does not really fit tight on the chair. Does definitely not look likethe picture that advertise this product."
2,Poor quality fabric - little better than muslin!,"I bought a cover with similar description several years ago, and it is much nicer, heavy-duty fabric. This doesn't lay or drape well at all because it is so flimsy."
2,Not as expected.,"This slipcover was not at all as pictured. It may as well have been a painter's dropcloth from the hardware store. The color was drab, and the cover itself just did not fit well. Very disappointed."
3,The Measure of All Things Worth the Price of the Book,"SF 7 is a good compulation worth reading. However, ""The Measure of All Things"" by Richard Chwedyk is exceptional and worth the price of the book all by itself. It has made me want to track down and read more Chwedyk to see if The Measure is a fluke or indicative of his usual work. Read this story! Especially if you are involved in animal rescue."
2,An unexceptional gathering of current stars in the field,"Hartwell's not a particularly adept editor. He's taken with a lot of star power and evidently lets a writer's prestige be the only criterion for inclusion in his anthologies. Most of these stories are competently written, but they lack spark, that sense of wonder that used to fill the field until about 15 years ago. It's like a lot of rock music these days: great talent with nothing much to say. How some of these stories made it into a ""year's best"" book is beyond me, but one thing is clear. The science fiction field is running dry. No story here has a decent (or even a twist) ending. Nothing here is genuinely memorable. I so much wanted these anthologies to be a counterpoint to the drab Dozois anthologies, but they aren't. If this is the best we can do, then I'd say we're in trouble. (And the sad part is that younger readers don't know how good science fiction used to be.)"
1,Do not trust seller,"To be fair, I can't really speak to the quality of this item, because I never received it. I placed my order on December 5th. I waited and waited, and it never shipped. Ten days later, on December 15, I contacted the seller, asking if and when they were going to ship my item. No response. Three days later, on December 18 (one day after the delivery window according to the seller), I wrote them again, saying if they didn't respond by December 20, I was going to file a claim with Amazon. Still no response. Lo and behold, at 4:30 pm on December 20, I receive a notice from Amazon that the seller cancelled my order as the item is out of stock. NO communication from the seller, and NO consequences from Amazon for their actions. DO NOT TRUST THIS SELLER."
3,Hmmm...,"The mat itself is fine, however, the company we bought it from taped something to the front which removed some of the design. I contacted them about it but never received a response. If you buy, make sure it has nothing taped to the front first - contact the seller to make sure :)"
1,Drive-In material?,"Not even good enough for second billing. There's Widescreen,and Fullscreen versions. This should have been Noscreen. It's just not right to charge people money to watch this."
3,PURL VICTORIOUS,"This made for TV movie doesn't leave any cliche unturned, but it does give Linda Purl the role of her career. Purl plays Lacey, a psychotic obsessive sister in law to recently widowed Linden Ashby. She's taken care of Ashby and his two children ever since her sister was killed in an auto crash two years earlier. Things go awry however when Ashby decides to remarry, and lovely Shannon Sturges becomes the target of Purl's possessiveness.Purl, a veteran TV performer, imbues Lacey with a dazzling and complex personality, shifting between the supposedly sweet and loving aunt to the vicious and vindictive harpy. Purl is quite good in the role and elevates this movie to a higher status."
1,BIG error on DVD packaging from the company!,"This DVD is receiving a negative review from me - not because of the film or because of the service.It is because of the DVD company. I ordered this with several other films. The packet states that it has English closed captions.However, it does not and I was unable to watch the movie because of this.I really wish that DVD companies would learn what the word ""closed captioned"" means before putting it on their DVDs. I also wish they would remember to put the English captions on.This is about the 10th time that I have bought a film and found out that it isn't captioned despite having the ""CC"" signature or the ""Closed captioned"" phrase on the back cover. Why can't DVD companies remember to put the captions on when they have it on their ""Extras"" list on the back of the DVD cover????I have to say that experiencing this error several times has really made me appreciate the good DVD companies that actually do put the closed captions on their DVDs."
5,horrorific,"Acquainted with the Night is a good book with short stories. It has many different things for everyone. The stories in there are typically not the same, very different."
4,A Great Health-Conscious Popcorn Oil,"I'm astonished it doesn't say so in the description, but this oil is known for its low levels of saturated fat. We all know the best tasting popcorn oil is truely heart-clogging, but Back to Basics uses sunflower oil for this product. While you shouldn't expect movie theater style butter from this oil, it certainly does leave your popcorn with a buttery, slightly nutty flavor. If you're like me and need something on your popcorn besides salt, this is probably your best bet."
4,"Pots hang nicely, quality metal, grid needs improvement","Looks nice, quality metal, comes with all hardware, well made except the grid. The grid doesn't lay flat at all and moves around. They could make it better by attaching the grid to rack or at least a way to keep it form moving with the basic horizontal hooks provided. Other than that, it seems like a nice rack so far. Easy to install as well."
5,wise and informative,this is a book of love& recipes for the soul& spiriti was one of the customers who used to shop in her brownstone i was introduced to her products by a friend at the time i would catch a cab and buy ylang ylang i would be energized i would buy ocean and i also remember the soft sounds in the back groundit was real cozy in there i would come home with my bag full of carols daughter and be happy as hell. and guess what i live close to the store now walking distance ... her face butter is the balm.... lol
1,my order never arrived,i cant review this book b/c it never arrived at its destination.this is the first time a book i ordered on amazon did not arrive but there is a first time for everything
3,"If you are planning to adopt from China, this is the book for you!","This was an interesting book for those that might be planning to adopt from China. It talks about the history of girls in China, and some laws, etc. She also went over the process for them. It was good, but I was wanting a little more of a memoir. It gives you a lot of info. on adoption in China, that's for sure!"
3,"Not bad content, but a little whiney.","I was expecting a little more from this book. I didn't get it. Maybe if I hadn't already read a lot of the books the author references, I would have been able to deal with the author's eccentricities she herself describes. (Making a ""shrine"" to her child-to-be.) I wouldn't recommend NOT to read it, but I wouldn't put it at the top of the list either."
5,Great informative book with heart and facts about adopting in China.,"This book is very easy to read if you are thinking of adopting or are adopting from China. It is full of information on chinese culture, the adoption process, and what may happen after you get back home. Some parts brought tears to my eyes, but I am a bit sappy. I would recommend this book to people adopting, thinking of adopting from China, or those who have already adopted. It really gives a lot of information on Chinese history and why so many little baby girls are abandoned shortly after birth. My heart goes out to all the lost daughters and I hope they are all given the chance to find a forever family."
4,Excellent adoption story and cultural lesson,"This book does a fantastic job of telling Karin Evans' adoption story. More importantly, it tells of all of the historical and cultural reasons that girls are abandoned, or ""Lost"", in China.This book is an excellent resource and a must read for people, like me, who are in the process of or have recently completed an International adoption in China. I received answers to many questions that I had and I'm sure my new daughter will have as she gets older."
4,Isaiah 1:17,"Several years ago as my wife and I started the process of adopting our first girl, my wife asked me to read The Lost Daughters of China. If you are adopting a Chinese girl or girls like we have, I think you should read this book. Although I felt much of what Evans said was information I already knew, the book is well written (minus Evans' postmodern universalist approach on religion). It made me think of who the biological mother of our daughters might be. Could they be homeless teenage girls or a 40 something peasant women with half a dozen children? If you want to learn more about adoption, I highly recommend Russell Moore's Adopted For Life: The Priority of Adoption for Christian Families and Churches."
5,The Lost Daughters of China,"Anyone contemplating an international adoption should read this book! As a matter of fact, my husband and I are waiting for our referral and are making this required reading for our daughters future Grandparents. Later in life when our daugher questions her roots, we hope to reference passages from Karin Evans'depiction of the daughers of china."
3,The Lost Daughters of China,"Karen Evans writes about her own experiences while adopting a baby Chinese girl from China. It was interesting to learn there are a great number of physical, emotional and financial stresses involved when adopting a child from China. I got the sense that she was a strong advocate for adoption as she discribed repeatedly how much love she felt towards her two adopted daughters. It seems as though she did a lot of research on the topic of adoption and conducted many interviews as she quotes other families that went through similar challenges. It's a touching story however, the last half of the book gets a little repetitious and boring as she imagines and frets over what the Chinese mothers might have felt. Overall, I enjoyed the book, but would not recommend reading it unless you want to adopt a child."
3,Recommended but...,"I found the book to be well researched, written, and quite informative but, as with all non-fiction books, by the time it is written, published and marketed things change.I feel that it does not currently reflect the situations or the social changes that have happened in China in relation to adoption, the one child policy and orphanages, since it was written. I am not suggesting that everything is wonderful, just that they have improved significantly.I think it would be great if she re-edited the book noting the current changes. While it would still be sad and heartwarming, I believe that it would give a much more positive view."
4,Very Good Book,This book was something I bought because it was on sale at the bookstore for $1.00...I am a social work student who is interested in a career in adoption as well as adopting a child one day. My young cousin was adopted from china at about 1 year old. she's 4 now and doing great. This story tells of all the paperwork and gov't red tape that must be gone through as well as what the little girls of china go through. From being abondened to being killed either at birth or before birth. It was a very interesting book and I hope to use it in my Comparitive Cultures class.
5,A wealth of information with personal touches,"This book is both a beautiful memoir of a woman's international adoption and a history/case study of international adoptions from Asia. It gives great information that spans decades of China/US adoption relations. The author does a wonderful job explaining the significance of Confucianism and China's ""One Child"" policy and how it has resulted in the ""Lost Daughters of China."" Anchee Min, the author of Falling Leaves, gives a beautiful forward to add to an already beautifully written and researched account."
4,Good resource for those considering Chinese Adoption,"This was the first book I read after my husband and I made the decision to adopt a Chinese baby girl. Parts of the book were very moving and I felt the author's emotions through the process of going to China to pick up their girl. Although the historical and political perspectives offered in the book are extremely important, I did feel that at times the information was a bit redundant and not as captivating as the personal story of their adoption. I would highly reccomend this book for those considering a Chinse adoption as it gives a good overview not only of the process and the emotions but also gives a good historical and political perspective of why there are so many children waiting to be adopted."
5,Considering a Chinese Adoption? - Read This First!,"This informational book is recommended to anyone considering the adoption of a Chinese girl. The morals, ethics and emotions involved in such adoptions are illustrated by the author as she relates her experience with the process. Karin Evans addresses the questions that all adoptive parents have, and then brings to the fore many considerations that are unique to the adoption of abandoned girls from China. A good resource for those beginning to think about adopting in China. Recommended reading for adoptive parents of Chinese girls who are are preparing for their daughter's questions about their native land and the reasons behind their abandonment."
4,Very Educational!,"A must read. Very informative on China and how the adoption process came to be what it is today & why. Sad and heartbreaking at the same time. Did not agree w/all aspects (belief system of author) but apart from that, it is a really good book."
5,sensational,ive been a fan of Don Thomas for years im wondering whats next i havent had the opportunity to hunt along with him in person but feel i have hope i meet him someday
5,Great Practice Balls,"Picked up these balls for practicing and they've worked out great!Somehow, they were selling for the unbelievable price of $9.99/dozen (some balls are $9.99/each!!). Though I was concerned about the quality, I figured what-the-heck-they're-dirt-cheap and picked up two dozen.I was impressed -- these balls are well made, the covers are synthetic and the stiching is nicely done. The are all marked 'PRACTICE' only, and each ball is wrapped in plastic. No COR or compression information is stamped on the balls. Fresh out of their bags, these balls have a nice tacky feel; the tacky feel has diminished with use.After a few heavy-duty practices, these balls have held up nicely -- no gouges, tears, lumps, etc. These balls come off the bat and play just like our game balls.Overall, I am extremely happy with this bargen-basement purchase!"
5,Not An Entertainer? Are You Crazy?,"I'm really struck by the fact that most people who've reviewed Lord Clark's series, ""Civilization"", have not mentioned what a riot he is. Seriously, he puts Dick Cavett to shame. If you want to see how truly funny he is, try this: put on the subtitles. It's a little distracting at first if you're not accustomed to reading what you're hearing simultaneously, but you'll quickly pick up the knack. Once you do so, two things will happen. One is you'll quickly realize that Clark IS writing his own material, and the second is you'll adjust to his rhythm of speaking and how he delivers that material. A lot of it is throwaway stuff, and much of it is witty as hell. Give it a try."
1,Amazon Needs To Warn This Is Region B,"Unfortunately I did not read all 107 customer reviews before I ordered this to discover that it's actually Region B and will not play on most US players (the US is region A). This is probably not Amazon's fault in that the packaging doesn't warn you either, but Amazon should note the fact now (since dozens have complained, finding out the hard way as I did)."
2,Poor Quality DVD,"Although the substance of Lord Clark's epic series remains bright, the medium does not. This is a series about great art, yet the BBC made no effort at all to remaster the original for these DVDs, which leaves the viewer with little art to appreciate. The colors are faded out to the point that sometimes it is difficult to see there is color at all; sepia is a dominant color and lush landscapes look barren. Some of the scenes have those old film cracks and scratches. It looks like it was merely duped to DVD from someone's 30 year old VHS tape.Bad show, BBC!"
1,Beware!,"To my regret I have discovered that these Blu rays are Area 2 and unplayable in the U.S. Nowhere on the set does it say anything about area; it merely lists the format as ""BD50x3 & BD25x1."" However the BBC's website lists the set as area 2 -not the U.S. It is conceivable that some U.S. players will play these discs, although my Denon DBP-2010ci will not. Of course, Amazon is good about returns, but they should investigate and change their statement that the discs are playable in all areas. Very disappointing because it was a wonderful program."
5,Fantastic Series!,"_Civilisation_ was the first official color broadcast on the BBC, in 1967. It is shot on 35mm film, which makes every historical site, museum and library visit look spectacular. Kenneth Clark has this classic British-ness, walking through a field in a brown suit, but his observations on art and (white) cultural rise and fall is timeless. One of my favorite quotes is delivered at the end of the 7th episode, ""Grandeur and Obedience,"" dealing with the Counter-Reformation in Christian Europe: ""...At least they weren't mean and furtive like some modern millionaires. But their contributions to civilisation was limited to this kind of visual exuberance. A sense of grandeur is no doubt a human instinct, but carried too far it becomes inhuman. I wonder if a single thought that has helped forward the human spirit has ever been conceived or written down in an enormous room."" This is ""public"" television at its finest, even for non-art historians."
3,"Good in its narrow scope, however...","It's appropriate that the series contains, in the title, ""A Personal View."" Clark injects his personal view many times, particularly that of a literalist, regarding Judeo-Christian theology. It's hard not to take him as a literalist, at times, and he certainly projects certain tenants of the typical Western literalist. It is best to perceive Clark as a man of his time, and he is certainly a striking representation of his era. He's lucid, insightful, and penetrating in thoughts--even, at times, when he seems to be merely projecting his own assumptions about some works of art.I don't know whether I'd have bought this if I'd known what the quality of the series was like--probably not. It is a mixture of keeness and superficiality. But for it's time, it was probably at the top of its genre."
2,disappointed,"I remembered this series when it first aired on BBC, it has not aged well. Kenneth Clarks opinions do not seem relevent now. The CDs are great quality unlike some of the reviewers stated, just not worth the cost."
1,Utter Garbage,"It is ridiculous to call this ""civilisation"". The whole thing is glorification of White Christianity, with no importance given to any other religion or non-white part of the world. Kenneth Clark is also a very boring presenter, and the script does not help.Words like ""barbarians"" are used very freely. Mr Clark is a personification of a bigoted white christian.There are much better choices available to give an overview of some of the periods covered by this set, e.g. ""The Medici Godfathers of the Renaissance""."
5,Kenneth Clark's Civilization,"I first watched this amazing series when I was in college in the late 70's. It left such an impression that I have never forgotten it...the beautiful photography, the choice of subject matter, and the skill which Sir Kenneth Clark wove it all together. His lectures are mesmerizing and he makes us intellectually and emotionally understand man's attempts to reach perfection. Thirty years later, I feel the same way and I'm so happy that this series is available for me to watch whenever I need inspiration!"
1,Not suitable for serious Messianic Jews or Christians,"This author is the leader of what sounds very much like a cult. He views himself as somewhat divine and claims that Yeshua is black. Whether or not Yeshua is black makes no difference to me, it's the premise that the color of Yeshua's skin is an understanding that is paramount to belief in the ""true"" Messiah.I am a Messianic Jew and an avid reader. This book was a waste of my money."
3,somthing ya don't see on tv anymore,ya don't see these kind of shows on tv anymore this one is not in english not full screen very campy the sub titals don't match with the story but otherwise entertaining lots of product placement.
4,"fun, engaging read","I really did enjoy this novel because I was not expecting Pullitzer Prize style writing. Bushnell does a great job interweaving her storylines and brings a sense of reality to her novel. Not everyone has the perfect love and work life and that is something she acknowledges through her writings. Nico, Wendy, and Victory are great characters whom I don't mind living vicariously through. I recommend this book to any one looking for an entertaining read."
5,Captivating!,"I started reading this novel and couldn't put it down. It's a captivating look at the lives of three uber successful career women. It's a glimpse into a world where helicopters are a common means of transportation, and having a car and driver are standard procedure. Even though these women live in a world that most of us will never experience, Candace has created characters that feel very real. When you're reading this novel you really do feel like you're a part of their world. What I also loved about LJ is the friendship that these characters share with one another. They are linked by their belief in themselves, and in each other. And this friendship makes each one of them stronger. Candace has infused the power and importance of friendship into this novel. LJ left me feeling empowered, like tomorrow could be the perfect day to take over the world!"
5,Great!!,"This novel was a great read. The plot is totally original, and I found it addictive and hilarious."
3,Lipstick Jungle....Where is the Sex and the Witty?,"Lipstick Jungle by Candace Bushnell ( author of SATC) - is ostensibly about power women who in their 40's, as opposed to girly girls in her relatable SATC.Needless to say these power women work in typically feminine industries - fashion, publishing and the movies.Somewhere in between are the under achieving husbands, under age lovers, over arching ambitions and stagnant relationships. Of course, add the billionare boyfriends and girly luncheons at NYC hotspots and for a moment it is almost SATC...but without the down to earth, honest, gritty, funny, candid confessions of women in their 30's who worship Manolo's.No relatable characters for the average reader... unless they happen to be teetering with a martini on the top rung of the corporate/fashion/publishing ladder."
2,"If you're shallow and you know it, clap your hands","Maybe this book just wasn't my style, but I found it dumb! dumb! dumb! Could the characters be any more shallow? And what's the male version of misogynistic?It also never felt like the plot was building up to something. And then it's as if CB just felt like stopping at that particular point (the end). I just didn't get it."
2,Terrible,"I am not a fan of this book.As with Sex and the City, we are led to believe that this book is about women who value themselves, their careers, and their friends, and I certainly support that. However, in this book, one character lies to get her manager's job, although he hasn't done anything wrong, while she is busy cheating on her husband. Another woman hardly knows her own children and is upset when her husband wants to help take care of them, who we are clearly supposed to dislike. A third woman gets drunk and trash-talks her future boss.I have enjoyed books before when I didn't like the main characters, but Ms. Bushnell made no effort to humanize any of the characters in this novel. All the characters felt two-dimensional, and most of them were whiny or stupid to boot."
4,Loved the story.,"I enjoyed this book better than 'Sex in the City' mainly because I enjoy reading about powerful women. The author did a good job of balancing their power with their femininity. They don't try to act like men just because they are powerful, and female readers will see themselves in at least one of the characters. Loved it."
5,Better than the series!,"The novel has some of the same story lines, but most are different enough to keep my attention. It's fantastic to picture the characters we know from the show, and delve into their lives of the novel. I love the additional insight the novel provides, and found myself torn between not being able to put it down and wanting to savor every page so that it would never end. Loved it!"
3,Decent and Funny,"I found the book to be a quick and fun read. It wasn't the best ""beach book"" ever, but it was pretty good overall. It was similar to Sex and the City in many respects and the tone reminds me of the show."
4,Intriguing story that rings with honesty,"I stopped reading novels by Jackie Collins because the characters and storylines have gotten so unbelievable and the characters are too transparent. As I started reading Lipstick Jungle, I thought I was reading another Jackie Collins-type book, but then I continued reading and got to the point where I didn't want to put the book down. The characters, Victory, Nico and Wendy are wonderfully life-like women who go through a lot of the same situations that today's women find themselves in. I have read all of Candace Bushnell's novels and find that this is one of my favorites. Thanks, Candace, for a great story!"
4,Bushnell Pleases Again,"After finding myself disappointed after Trading Up, I was cautious about buying Lipstick Jungle. However, I was pleasantly surprised. This book started off, and I was immediately lost in the world on these women. It was refreshing to read about women who are powerful in NYC who have family and other priorities in life than sleeping with men and shoes. Don't get me wrong- I'm a big Sex and the City fan, but I enjoy reading books with deeper characters.A book worth reading."
5,The Importance of Friendship,"I found the friendship between Candace Bushnell's three main characters very touching. The message that I got from Lipstick Jungle was the importance of having true friends. The women in this novel provide a strong support system for each other, and they are always there for a late night phone call, a premiere, or a fashion show. They support each other in every way and know that their main loyalties lie with their friends. Though they may be cutthroat in business, they are the exact opposite when it comes to each other. Lipstick Jungle shows us that women can succeed in a man's world, but more importantly that women need to stick together and help each other out. Eventually, we'll have so many super successful women out there that it won't be just a man's world anymore."
2,Far from a page turner,"This book was rather dull compared to the last one. I absolutely loved 4 blondes, trading up was decent, but it wasn't good until the end. This book is a far cry from the others. It lacked the passion and excitment that the other books and sex and the city held. I really liked Wendy Healy's character, and I thought the only interesting plot in the book with her divorce, but after while it was depressing. Nico's affair was hot, but only a few pages were wrote about it. Overall the characters in the book just had a bunch of boring problems with their careers, which was rather repeatative. Although I do get bored with the constant man problems in books, she didn't have enough romance and scandal in this book. Frankly after this book I think that Candance Bushnell, is starting to lose her young audience.Vixenchick"
4,Women with Power and Friendship,"I didn't really like Four Blondes, didn't read Trading Up, but thought I'd give Lipstick Jungle a chance. Reading about ""older"" women for a change was a nice break from the typical twenty-somethings in these types of stories. These women worked their butts off to get where they were, but they still kept their friendships. I think that female friendships is something that this book does really well, even if the whole New York world Bushnell writes about was a little too over the top for me at times."
2,Transparent and uninspired,"While this book continues along the lines of a ""Sex and the City"" type atmosphere of girlfriends, their boyfriends and/or husbands, and the high life of New York City, Bushnell is unabashedly blunt in her feministic intentions. It seems the book is written solely for this goal; you start to get involved in the plot, only to be drawn back to the reality and transparency of Bushnell's feminist intentions with an ill-timed comment. The idea that women can be successful and multi-talented in the fast-paced business world of big cities, while juggling friends, emotional issues, and familes, is a good one, but these ideas of woman-power are poorly executed. They are juxtaposed strangely with the plot--any inspired reader would understand her motive without these ill-placed, blatant reminders every other page or so, which I found distracting.Aside from that, the plot was OK, but not the ""page turner"" as labeled by Publisher's Weekly."
1,Nitwitlit,"A co-worker loaned me this book and it failed my ""first paragraph"" rule which is, if I'm not hooked by then I usually pass. But I gave it a try for the sake of camraderie. How does the stuff Bushnell writes get published? Do her editors actually read this pap? It's not literature, it's nitwitlit. My rating? Two eyelids down. If amazon allowed a rating of less than 1 star, I'd give it."
4,"More money, more problems...","Candace Bushnell's latest novel takes us once again inside the penthouses on the prosperous streets of New York City. Nico, Wendy, and Victory are some of the city's power players, but unfortunately, they also have some power problems. Lucky for us, since these problems are what ultimately drive the plot of this escapist novel.What I appreciate about this novel, and about Bushnell's characters overall, is that no matter how prominent or important her female protagonists are, they are friends. The talk show style backstabbing is left to minor characters so that readers see true female friendships grow and develop.Lipstick Jungle is a fun and delightful read that ultimately leaves readers wondering if money and power is all that it is cracked up to be."
3,Totally different....,"My rating is a bit misleading, because ""Lipstick Jungle"" is not a bad book, it just has a totally different voice/feel than Bushnell's three previous novels. I completely agree with another reviewer who mentioned that ""Lipstick"" read like a Judith Krantz book- which is NOT a bad thing. I am huge Krantz fan, but was not expecting that type of book from Bushnell. It's like she has lost her edge...the previous books left me with a bittersweet feeling...much more realistic and gritty than this latest effort. The plot(s) were also pretty dull and overdone. If I had been asked who the author was, I NEVER would have guessed Candace Bushnell."
4,Cynthia Nixon reads the audiobook!,"Cynthia Nixon (Miranda from SATC) is such a good reader! I never realized what a pleasant voice she had until I listened to this audiobook. At a bit over 6 hours unabridged it's a pretty quick 'read,' and I liked it much better than4 Blondes(way too many sex scenes and weirdos in that one.)If you missSex and the City: The Complete Series (Collector's Gift Set)and want to read something similar, I'd definitely recommend this.Now, there were parts that were INFURIATING (especially Shane, Wendy's husband! I literally wanted to wrap some pantyhose around his neck and watch him die slowly! he was THAT disgusting!) If men being horrible, manipulative and abusive to women upsets you, maybe I'd say avoid this book. It was worth the agitation for me because all the women get good endings but, it might not be the same feeling for you."
5,Great,Super fun book. If you like Candace Bushnell you will love this. It's great brain candy & an enjoyable read.
4,good weekend read,I enjoyed this book. If you liked Candace Bushnel's other books you will like this one as well.
1,Candace Bushnell,I am a young woman and I cannot accept that Candace Bushnell is a feminist. This book is not any different than the rest of her creations. I do believe that most people in this world are not as vulgar as Candace Bushnell's characters and I do believe that most people in their everyday life are not obsessed only with thoughts for promiscuous sex.
3,Gratuitous Racism,"I'm only halfway through the book. But a gratuitous racist line threw me off and I haven't been able to get it out of my mind.On page 43 of the paperback edition:"". . . .It was eleven a.m. and she was still at home, still in her Chinese blue silk pajamas imprinted with humorous drawings of small dogs. Which might in itself be some kind of insider Chinese joke, she thought, because there was nothing the Chinese loved more than eating man's best friend."""
2,Like a children's book (except for the sex and the language),"Completely unrealistic. How can anyone identify with these super-powerful and rich women? Buying your ex-husband a flat right next to yours so you can both be next to the kids? And so unimaginative. The producer woman's movies are called ""Ragged Pilgrims"" and ""The Spotted Pig"" (which is a romance). Was Bushnell trying to be humorous? So horrible. Read it if you have nothing else to do."
1,Don't Waste your Precious Time: BORING,"Sometimes you just want to read a trashy novel, full of gossip and twists and scandal. Not so here. Promises are broken with this novel from the ""Sex and the City"" famed author.Boring is the word to describe this, and possibly ludicrous. Kept waiting for someone's husband to turn out gay, or someone's lawyer or P.I. to catch someone doing something, but NOPE... even though she kept edging closer and closer to a decent scandalous twist, she never delivered.Save your money and time and read some old Olivia Goldsmith for a good trashy novel."
2,Why three plot lines?,"Candace Bushnell wrote ""Lipstick Jungle"" from the perspective of three different narratives: Wendy, the movie executive, Nico, the editor of chief of Bonfire magazine and Victory, the fashion designer.At times it gets sort of confusing who is who and the reader is left with the feeling that the author had three good ideas for three new books and somehow put them all in one. It is interesting however, to see Selden Rose, a character from ""Trading Up"", reappear in this novel, good to know that he has recovered from the failed marriage to Janey Wilcox.All in all the relationship between the three main characters remains unclear throughout the entire book, they just seem to be acquainted with each other for no apparent reason, occasionally talk or lunch together and talk about their individual lives."
2,Forgettably DULL,"What a boring book- and believe me, I read it till the BITTER end. Ms. Bushnell is not creative nor very talented when it comes to writing. She has potential, but it remains untapped."
1,"Same city, lame story!","For years and years, we've hungered for the stories of the rich, the famous, the powerful. Some of the stories end up becoming great literature, others more forgettable yet still highly enjoyable. This book sets us up for a yet another fairly predictable SEX IN THE CITY version of the world and of women's lives and yet miserably fails even that two-dimensional, whiny and petty world. In just the first chapter, the characters and the all-too-predictable nasty events to come are offset by breathless, insider observations to make the rest of us feel like we're in on a great big secret world. Unfortunately for Ms. Bushnell, she's written a book for a world that few of us really care about, and not particularly well. Don't bother with this. And please, don't paint it with the ""chick lit"" title. It doesn't deserve to be alongside some truly splendid and involving novels."
2,Fluff,"A very lightweight, predictable look at three fortyish, attractive, and achieving women who are at or near the top in their fields of movie executive, magazine publisher, and fashion designer. There is no plot per se. The book mostly consists of a series of scenarios for triumph and enhancing status, generally at the expense of devious and loutish men. The few difficulties that they have, ranging from their own infidelity, divorce from, of course, a no-account husband, or overbearing executives, are easily overcome with reputations and situations remaining intact, if not improving. Of course, their own shortcomings are largely unquestioned.The author creates a fantasy world of implausible, even cartoonish, people who are immune from everyday realities and consequences and float through the world of the rich. Despite all of the celebritiy emulation, the book has no pizazz; it's just boring."
1,Absolute trash,"What sort of racist trash is this? As an Asian, I was extremely insulted by the occasional racial slurs against Asians in this book. Chinese people like nothing better than eating dogs? Japanese men are still saying outdated sexist things like ""Men know better, women no listen?"" I stopped reading after the first few chapters, which I only read because I was bored out of my mind. I'm a big fan of chick lit, but even I thought it was pretty damn bad writing. Sex and the City may have gained fame by being incorporated into a TV series, but that doesn't have anything to do with Bushnell's writing skills--it's just about the plot. Yet another brainless book by a talentless hack."
4,Pretty Good!,"I enjoy all of Candace Bushnell's novels! This one was about Wendy, Nico and Victory and their various expeditions.....somewhat of a ""Sex and the City"" type deal. Good beach reading!"
5,Can't put it down!!!,"I guess from reading the reviews, you either love it or hate it. I loved it! I couldn't put it down! It was a great escape into three other lives, very different from each other. Some people are missing the point here...maybe because they don't value friendship but friendship is an important relationship that has gotten these women through some really touch times. THAT's the point! FRIENDSHIP AND RELATIONSHIPS. That's the point of this book and I loved it!Maybe if people stop focusing on themselves and have more respect for their relationships, they would have enjoyed the book much more. Life is not lived happily by Individualism. Everyone needs relationships to LIVE."
2,Unappealing,"I just didn't love the characters. I didn't believe in them, despite my love of chicklit on occasion. It all felt got-up, as if Ms Bushnell had gone out and read a lot of books on how to be a dress designer etc. It also felt absolutely feral with slavering envy and that's not comfortable. And some of it just seemed incredible. I am now leaving my computer and going to Manhattan where I'm hoping my English accent will net me 150 k a year as a nanny."
1,Not worth your time,"CB's latest book is 200 pages of repeating ""women can have a job and a family and succeed in powerful careers"" said in many different ways. Although I agree w/ the author that it is possible for women to have it all, she presented three characters who are not unusual. Their jobs were unique, but one woman was single with no kids, and the other two had kids, but also had stay at home husbands. Point is, they were working all the time, but they had as much help as they needed for their personal life. On top of that, the plot goes just about no where and it's not even that fun to read. If you are looking for an entertaining, brainless, but good New York book, try Everyone Worth Knowing."
2,boring,just a boring book too trashy. Was nothing like sex in the sity. this girl is scandolous and very drama orientated
3,get never too late its better,this albums stand out tracks are snake and crawl. snake is a great song and kicks *ss crawl is also a great tune too. but its hard to give this album a good rating after listening to never too late. never too late is just so great its hard to compare them. but all in all this cd is good i bought them both and love them both
5,Good value on Crown staples,"These Grex crown staples appeared to be the low cost option on Amazon. Grex is a well know brand, and even though my air stapler was of a different make, these worked great. The box was a little mangled in shipping (some sticks were out of the box), but not a big deal."
1,Will not fit Mikita or other staple guns,"I purchased these galvanized staples to install insulation. They will not fit my Mikita, or anyother staple gun I own. Apparently they only fit Grex staple guns. They are too narrow."
4,Shockingly scary because it is not fiction!,"Maury Terry takes you into a world of horrifying killings, cover-ups and conspiricies. You will be amazed at what you learn about the most brutal murders to plague New York City. The book takes you from New York to California to Texas and North Dekota. The amount of evidence that the police ignored in their rush to find the ""lone"" killer will astonish you. I cannot remember when I was more freightened reading a book. You will learn the truth! END"
3,"Not the whole story, one suspects","While generally well written--and certainly informative--Paul occasionally devolves into rather mindless and somewhat self-aggrandizing rhetoric. Far more interesting and humorous stories can be found in Tangherlini's ""Talking Trauma"" published by the University Press of Mississippi."
3,"Compelling, but...","Sometimes the trouble with a book is not in what it reveals, but what it does not. Paul is a marvelous storyteller, and I couldn't put the book down. Perhaps then it's a function of success that I wanted her to tell more. Missing, except in tantalizing little bits, is an account of how her fire-fighting life informs or connects to her intimate one: granted, she reconciles with a parent and embraces faith, and maybe the rest of what I'm curious about just has to wait for her autobiography. Ultimately, however, it's unsatisfying to be told everything, and nothing, at the same time. She thanks someone in the Acknowledgements, for instance, for ""putting up"" with it/her, but who is putting up with what is never glimpsed in the text itself. And that's too bad. It feels like something's missing. Perhaps it's the real Caroline Paul."
2,It was Ok not enough HAZMAT stuff,This is a great book about Firemen and their job they perform. I look over my men everyday and respect all the work that they do. They are true professionals and show extreme brotherhood.
3,FF/EMT in MN,"I wasn't overly impressed with this book. I am an Firefighter and EMT and thought there was to much complaining about it being tougher on women. If you can pull your weight and do your job respectively, you gain the respect of your colleagues. Normally I keep all my books regarding firefighting. I gave this one away because I knew I wouldn't read it again."
5,Couldn't put it down!,"Caroline Paul shares with us not only the ""fighting fires"" and ""putting people back together"", but more important, her most intimate thoughts, feelings and emotions attached to her experiences as a firefighter. She comes across as a beautiful, courageous and compassionate woman who had the guts and the smarts to overcome the prejudice and ""good old boy"" attitude in the firehouse and gain acceptance into that ""family."" This book made me laugh and cry; it's awesome!"
3,"Yes, I'm fascinated, but then ???","Enjoyed the book but ... too many times I wondered what happened next. What did she think about that? And then? We are given only the tips of the iceberg and no hint as to how large it may be underneath. Is this an on-going problem? Was it a one time thing?So many times I wanted to know more, but the details were not given. I hope she writes another book about a narrower part of firefighting, being a woman firefighter, or working in San Francisco as a firefighter and gives us more details."
3,"Insightfull, but a bit to risky","Paul's book does cover the reality of ""the job"" in an old established department. It is tough for anyone today, not just women as she pointed out. The only criticism I found was she will only help perpetuate sterotypes of women firefighter's by her comments of her thoughts and feeling about women. I can say this from my heart being in the servive for 10 years."
5,Love revised versions!,"I read ""Fighting Fire"" when it first came out, and reading the revised edition was a great pleasure. Caroline Paul rocks and her story is an inspiration to strivers everywhere. After you read her memoir, check out her gorgeous novel, ""East, Wind, Rain."""
5,Great book,"The reason I loved this book is because its beautifully written. I wouldn't have thought a firefighter could write so lyrically, but one has. But its also a speedy read about adventure and adrenalin, from birthing babies to running into fire buildings. Ever since reading this book hearing fire sirens means a whole lot more to me, and i say a small prayer to keep those men and women safe."
3,"Oh, how I wanted to like this book.","Because of Leo Carey's wry, admiring, melancholy essay in THE NEW YORKER, I grabbed this novel and its two sequels when I found them at a local used bookstore, and oh, how I wanted to like them more than I ended up doing. But they're just not as good as the hype. They drift all over the place [to be fair, Carey admitted that devotees of mysteries would find these books too undisciplined], and the narrator's aggressively amoral personality -- imagine P. G. Wodehouse's Bertie Wooster crossed with Jonathan Gash's Lovejoy -- can wear on one after a while. The plots are made of Swiss cheese, at best, and these books are also sadly dated in their views of women. Maybe it's because I read the Lovejoy books before these -- if I had come to them without knowing about Lovejoy, I would have enjoyed them more."
2,Too self-involved,"Charlie Mortdecai is as good as advertised, amoral and decadent. But the majority of the book seems to be Charlie just talking to the reader. The action is slow and jerky. I had trouble staying interested in this one."
1,Biggest Need for Speed disappointment,I finished the game a mere 8 hours after purchasing it. May be more fun online but the storyline part of the game is way to short. And it seems as the higher you get the worse your car's handling becomes. Blacklist was ten times better and Underground 2 was 5 times better. There are a decent amount of cars and customization but the gameplay is really lost in this one. The idea for Carbon Canyon was good but I find that there are certain aspects of the canyon that are just stupid. If you skip a race and come back to it later they still have the same car and if you are driving a Lamborghini you can not overtake them. And they never crash off the cliff and you cannot make them crash. When playing in co op mode half the time in the upper levels my team-mates cost me races by stopping in front of me or by taking short cuts that get me hit by other cars or the short cut slows me down. The game is only 10% of what it should be.
1,Didn't work,"we expect more in this game, but it didn't work, very dissatisfied! !I don't recommend to any body to buy this game."
3,"Need for speed, lack of detail","This is my second Need for Speed game, the first was NfS Underground 2. The graphics for racing are much better in this game, but you do not get the control over what you add to the car like you did in the previous versions. However the cop chases are great."
5,Need for Speed Carbon,I bought this for my grandson for Christmas 2006. He used it all day and still uses it. Shipping was very quick.
5,Stirring,"A poignant account of an aristocratic muslim family in Moorish Spain, Tariq Ali spins a brilliant tale of empires lost and heroism re-discovered. One of my personal heroes from his days as a student leader in the 60's, Ali is as always brilliant in his penmanship. I was introduced to his writings by my father, a close personal friend of the author and Iv been hooked ever since. One of the very best accounts you could find of Moorish Spain and the end of an empire that gave the world such architectural masterpieces like the Al-Hambra."
4,Una hermosa novela,"Una hermosa novela que nos llevará fácilmente a mundos lejanos ya, pero presentes aún en el bagage cultural colectivo. Muy recomendable para leer apaciblemente, para disfrutar con su literatura y sus valores humanos."
2,Don't forget now: Christians are wicked!!,"This is the first time I have been unable to finish a book. Tariq Ali is not a bad writer but the rhythm of his prose is constantly drowned out by the relentless grinding of his axe. Every time one is beginning to settle into the story, a group of the Muslim characters, who are otherwise well drawn, are made to engage in some wooden dialogue about the wicked uncultured Christians in a wholly unnatural way.Tariq Ali has found a very interesting subject for a novel but he is unable to let the story speak for itself. He just can't stop himself from ramming his opinions down the reader's throat. It reads like a novel punctuated by political speeches from his student days. If the subject matter were any different it would be laughable; as it is, it seems that it is just too PC to point out the very obvious shortcomings in this book."
4,One of the best of a small bunch.,"I brought this book because I was planning to build a kit (plasma cut boat).The information in this book is valuable and to the point.He also makes some important points about buying a steel boat.However, in common with most boat building books it needs a whole chapter on costing and time to build to make it complete.To get a handle on costing I would recommend:-1) ""Steel Away"" by Smith and Moir2) ""the Cruising Life"" by Jim Trefethen (I keep on rereading this book).3) ""Insider's Guide to Buying a Powerboat"" by J.P. Lamy"
2,Beautiful Silliness,"For about three quarters of the this movie I was quite literally spellbound. Beautifully acted, beautifully shot, subtle and intelligent---how the hell is this guy going to pull this off, I wondered as the plot twisted and turned into what promised to be a riveting denouement.Simple answer: he didn't. Writer/Director Lucas painted himself into a corner--then tried to walk out of it, slipped on the wet paint, and slid across the room in a startling pratfall.I...laughed.I burst out laughing at the ending. It's such calculated, pretentious nonsense. And it's all in the writing. The actors were brilliant and the thing is so beautifully shot--the music, mood, the little touches--all great. And all rather beside the point.Whatever it was supposed to be."
4,A great thriller,"A tight storyline. Well enacted and supported by some superb cinematography. A carefully laid out story of deceit, revenge and drama. Enjoyed it."
5,Bitterly Brilliant,"This is a love triangle story like it's never been done before. All three lead actors are simply great, and the agony and ecstasy they put each other through leads to a knockout of an ending. Patricia Clarkson is at her peak, playing a wealthy wife who has failed as a scriptwriter and Campbell Brown is terrific as the bisexual husband with no morals who alternately adores and ignores her. Peter Saarsgard is also great as the gay scriptwriter who is on the verge of having it all, except the one thing he really wants to reclaim - his lost love."
4,Fascinating - and twisted,"Based on a play, ""The Dying Gaul"" is an extremely well made film, with three extraordinary actors, particularly Skarsgaard. It's pretty obvious that it was a stage play, but I don't think it's really detrimental to the film version. There are a lot of twists and turns, although I had an idea of how it would turn out and I wasn't far off the mark -- just not the details. This is definitely worth seeing if you care about good acting."
5,Great Movie -- Everyone should see it,"Great performances by Patricia Clarkson, Peter Sarsgaard, and Campbell Scott, but what else can you expect from them. Sarsgaard and Clarkson are especially rivetting.Great direction, editing, and cinematography. A beautiful and fascinating movie to watch.Sometimes the dialogue seems a bit too Mamet-like, if you like that type of intellectual cold preciseness.It is full of suspense. The movie will keep you wondering what these fascinating characters will do and say.Yes, it is about two bisexuals who had a life changing gay love, one more serious than the other though maybe both as tragic.It is more about love and relationships, and how lies, manipulation, desires, and dreams can bring out the best and the worst in us."
4,"""Psychedelic Cabaret Music"" Indeed","What an album! ""Mr. Smolin"" is one of L.A.'s legendary radio DJs, Barry Smolin. Great melodies, gorgeous lush arrangements, hooky tunes you can't get out of your head, and very appealing warm psychedelicized production punctuated with super-hip horns and touches by Stew, who is a genius on his own records.Smolin's voice is a tad rough and dorky-sounding in the Trey Anastasio vein, but I love that, and the lyrics are geeky transcendental poetry:""I thought angels would take me for a spinAround the heavenly arcadeI wanted angels to open my windowAnd call me a witness to all that we have made""A marvelous, weird, brilliant album."
2,First Out 2,"I was somewhat disappointed with this video. The selections were short and apparently were made by film students. Most of them also had to do with disappointments in love: The guy coming on to his buddy, only to have the buddy shun him and leave; the man thinking about his boyfriend who had left him; the teacher worried about a student with whom he had shared a passionate moment. It would have been nice to have at least one of the films where the love between two men triumphed."
1,Not what you think,There are some interesting stories here but they are rather depressing. This video includes stories that reflect loves lost. Nothing but. There is no happy ending.
3,small town texas review,This book includes recipes that have so many hard to find or expensive ingredients it is just not pratical for the average middle class cook. The recipes sound wonderful and the pictures are very appealing but I will probably never be able to make many of them because of the expense and the hard to find items.
3,Complex recipies but good,The recipies are more complex than I hoped for but they all look great and look forward to trying them.
5,Great small HDTV,"When my 10 year old big tube TV bit the dust, I knew it was time to move into the 21st century. This is a great second or third television for the bedroom. Not too big, not too small. Just the right size. Very good HD picture quality. Remote is easy to use, HDMI ports are a nice bonus for the price. The sound quality is not the best, but the controls and the input/output connections are ample and allow for almost everything needed to show through a monitor/TV screen."
5,Great buy,Browsed a lot before settling on this model which Amazon had at a great price. Picture is excellent which we were expecting but the audio was the real surprise. Transforms one's television experience. Instructions weren't great ie it took an evening of frustration before all elements were connected properly ie cable box and dvr and wireless headphones.
2,Just OK,"I own the Samsung LNS4096D 40 inch. The picture quality is suberb. I realized that the LNT2353H televion was NOT 1080p but I expected it to be much better than it was. I adjusted the contrast, brightness, sharpness,etc. until the cows came home. It was still very dark and grainy. Bottom line, I returned."
2,disappointed,"Out of the box, the settings on the Samsung are totally inappropriate for normal DVD and HDTV watching. A typical customer would need a Ph.D. in TV-ology to tweak the multitude of settings available for optimizing picture. At the very least, it is necessary to change the ""vivid"" picture mode to ""normal"". Others (on similar Samsung TV's) have suggested ""movie"" mode but the color scheme is very yellow and washed-out. The HD broadcasts look quite nice, but anything else, including DVD's via component cables from a progressive-scan player, are very disappointing. Not surprisingly, standard-definition broadcasts (digital, via satellite in my case) looked terrible. Also, the contrast ratio should be much better for a small TV at this price."
4,pretty sweet,"This is a great tv for the price. It is not the biggest thing, but perfect for the bedroom. The delivery was fast and it arrived in one piece. I have no complaints. The only thing that I didn't like about the tv is that the picture gets dark when you are not viewing from directly in front. But that is the price you have to pay for a lcd and not a plasma.Overall, great tv, great quality, great service. I would definitely purchase from this source again.JI"
1,POOR QUALITY OF PARTS,"I BOUGHT THE PRODUCT FROM AMAZON. IT CAME ON TIME, AND THE PRICE WAS SUPER. I BROUGHT IT TO VENEZUELA, AND THE TV HAD AUDIO WORKING OK, BUT NO VIDEO. SAMSUNG DID NOT HONOR THE WARRANTY. IT HAS BEEN GOING FROM ONE REPAIR SHOP TO ANOTHER. IT HAS ALREADY BEEN 4 MONTHS WITHOUT THE TV. HONESTLY, IT IS A POOR QUALITY PRODUCT.NONE OF THE SONY THAT I HAVE BOUGHT (MORE THAN 4) HAS NEVER FAILED ME.I WILL NEVER BUY SAMSUNG AGAIN."
1,Not acceptable,"The picture is clear with correct colors only viewed squarely. looking from slightly below center, the colors turned orange and the picture dimmed on standard setting. vivid was much worse. I have returned this unit and purchased a Sony which does not have any of these negative problems."
1,Worst Pressure-Cooker Cook Book Ever,"No recipes are ""inspired"" like you will find throughout ""Miss Vickie's"" and to a slightly less degree in Lorna Sass books.Buy it only if you want lots of good info on canning, plus recipes for baby octopus and cut-up squid.Now I have to figure out how to return the book to Amazon.NOTE: This bad review does not include Fagor pressure cookers, which I've found to be great. I recommend Amazon's FAGOR-combo whch share the same lid. Using a basket, the larger one nicely steams 5# potatoes for garlic smashed potatoes. Smaller one holds 6 pork chops, etc."
3,basic beginners book,"Good beginners book.The recipes could use relevent pictures, as most pictures don't match the accompaning recipes."
1,Not the ARS I remember,"This is NOT the ARS I remember from the '70's! It really disappointed me when I listened to it because I was waiting to hear some of that kinda gritty guitar and vocals. Not there. Sounds like a ""Parrot"" recording. Don't waste your money."
1,Horrible review guide,"I've taken a total of six ap's in high school and i have 3 left this year. I've always found princeton review to have the most concise, helpful books, but this one is simply horrible. The way its written makes it confusing, random and unorganized. Never buy a review book written by an Indian guy. (I would know I am one) I have to order another review book because this one is not helpful at all."
3,"Is it just me, or this book confuses a random sample with a SRS?","I spent some 20 mins browsing this book at my local bookstore. I believe the author states that a random sample is the same thing as a simple random sample. This is not really so. In a random sample, every unit has the same probability of being chosen as every other unit. In a simple random sample (SRS), the whole sample (n units) has an equal probability of being chosen as every other sample of n units from the same population. A given sample may be a random sample and not necessarily be a simple random sample.Some other statistics books are also using random sample as a shortcut expression for simple random sample, but beware that they are actually two different things.Otherwise, this book seemed comprehensive and well organized to me. It teaches a little more statistics than you need for the AP exam, and it does not provide as much AP-sepcific insider hints as Duane Hinders' book."
4,great cd but...,"i've been diggin on s1 and illmind for a minute now, however amazon doesn't offer the 'explicit lyrics' version. i just received my copy in the mail and i'm a bit disappointed that all the so-called ""bad words"" are bleeped out. if i wanted to listen to a radio version i would turn on my radio. its difficult to get into the rhyme skills of these gifted brothas when i keep getting distracted by the censorship. and yes i'm a grown *ss man so i can listen to cussin' if i so choose. other than that the disc is quite exceptional."
5,S1 and Illmind,"This CD is a breath of fresh air for hip-hop!!! I love it. Symbolyc one and Illmind are two of the dopest new producers in hip-hop. This CD also showcases that Texas actually has true authentic MCs, like Strange Fruit Project, K-Otix, Bavu Blakes,etc. I recommend this CD for any real hip-hop head."
2,not so original anymore... again!!,"I've loved Chi Chi's salsa. Several years ago they ""improved"" it. It tasted like garbage after that so I stopped buying it. Then after a few years they started making the ""original"" version. Reminds me of new Coke. Anyway, my favorite salsa was back! Over the past few years they've been screwing around with it. It's no longer the original recipe AGAIN. Don't these guys ever learn?? So guess what. I stopped buying it again."
3,Good but not great,To start off with Hugo's vocals are great top notch AOR. This album was a little different for a few reasons. 1) He uses different musicians on this album. 2) Gary Hughes of Ten is missed in the songwriting department. The album is more ballad intensive good to be sure but one that you need to be in the mood for. A good album but not as good as his first.
3,Could have been better...,"Hugo's second solo CD is not as good as his self-titled first CD, but until the arrival of ""Arrival"" it is better than anything you will hear on the radio today. (I still listen to the first CD at least a few times each week.) All of the songs are fine, but there are just too many slow tunes. Hugo's fans have come to expect up-beat, crank-it-up rockers, with good production. With this Steve Perry-like schlepp out of his system Hugo will hopefully return to what he does best! With the new Steve Augeri powered Journey CD due out next year, Hugo should release a new CD in '01 and ride the impending wave of quality rock!"
4,Penguin Racer,"I purchased this toy to use with handicapped preschool students. It has been great as a motivational toy, as a reward for completing a task and for a severely handicapped child it has assisted with her visual tracking abilities. It has also been effective with students beginning toverbalize."
3,defective toy,"This toy was opened up Christmas morning and was defective as it had a missing part. Would not work without it. My grandchildren were very disappointed. I know it is a cute toy when it works properly, but remember when ordering online, you can't get quick refunds or replacements for defective merchandise. The company did give me a refund but not for several days. Had to reorder from another company."
3,Bring On the Giggles,Our 2 yr old grandchild likes Baby Einstein and was delighted to receive this toy shown in some Baby E's videos. Good for a two year old but light on interest for older ones.
3,Bizarre little toy,"I thought this would be a game and a different penguin might win each time. . .hence the name ""Penguin Race"". Nope. It is just three penguins going up the escalator and round and round the track. It is extremely well made and durable. My children enjoyed watching the penguins for a while, but, in the end, they are much too old (6,9,10) to enjoy it for more than a short time. On the shelf it goes. I will hand it down to my 3 year old nephew because I think smaller children will find it more enjoyable. And yes, it is loud. . .squeak, squeak, squeak. My children and I did enjoy seeing our year old standard poodle try to figure out what the heck was going on with the penguins."
3,Penguin Race toy,"This toy is really cute to watch. My kids really enjoy it and it reminds me of a classic disney rollercoaster toy that I once had. The only concern I had with this Penguin Race was the assembly process. I thought the plastic track was going to break, but thankfully it didn't. Hopefully it will last for years to come!"
1,LOUD and Annoying and LOUD (did I mention LOUD?),"My oldest son has Autism, and he loves this toy. He will sit and watch the penguins go round and round for quite a while, which is unusual for him. If he could give this a rating, he'd give it 5 stars.What amazes me about my son, is that with his Autism, the racket this thing produces doesn't bother him. Frankly, I don't see how, because it gets on my nerves after 15 seconds. It makes this squeaky ""yip"" sound about 3-4 time per second (yes, per SECOND), and it's obnoxiously loud.No, you can't turn the sound off, but I was able to take it apart and cut the wire to the noisemaker inside. That helped tremendously. Now my son can run this all day if he wants to, and my ears don't bleed anymore."
3,Fun- but issues,"Our three year old saw this at his cousins house and we all fell in love with it. We didn't find the noise an issue, but others might. The kids could watch this for ours. We did have a major issue with the battery compartment. Perhaps our was just defective, but the the compartment was just too tight a fit for the battery. There was no way to compress the spring and get the battery in at the same time. We had to take the whole front off to get the battery in. Hopefully yours is better, because we love this toy."
2,Penguin Race 2?!,"I ordered this for my sister since this is the game we used to play with all the time as kids for christmas. When I got it, I saw it wasn't the original but Penguin Race 2. I ordered this because the picture shows it is the first one and that is what we used to play with. I can't even return it if I wanted to because I'm not even in the states anymore. I am disappointed with this product since it wasn't what I ordered and expected"
4,Penguin Race,the toy was very fun and my 3 year old loved watching it. The noise or squeaking it made became very annoying. It was very loud . I wish you could turn the noise off or it would just be quiet
3,LOUD ! BUT KIDS LOVE IT!!,"For the monies it is such a fun toy for the small ones.. I purchased this one for a 7 year old and she is a bit old for the toy but plays with it some. I also purchased the dalmation one for my 2 and 4 year old grandchildren and they just love it, I also read the review regarding the noise level of this toy and took the advice of the writer and disconnected the ''squeek'' 'squeek'' that was so annoying.. all in all the price and content is well worth the little effort it takes to make it fun... enjoy Mimi/from, Calif."
5,"Fun, but the squeaker had to go...","Our 2 year old absolutely loves this toy. We gave it to him before Christmas and he still plays with it for hours even with all the other new toys around. After a week though, we couldn't handle the squeaking anymore so we followed a previous reviews instructions on how to shut up the penguins by removing the little plastic accordion piece inside. Worked like a charm!! We are sane again!!HINT: Just make sure the arm piece that was attached to the squeaker is aligned before screwing the two pieces back together or the stairs won't work."
4,How to get the penguins to shut up!,"Great toy, but as stated, the sqeaker has to go. I did this simply by taking it apart and removing it. It's easy enough to do, just take all the screws out (all you need is a phillips screwdriver)and pull the 2 peices apart. You'll see a small clear plastic ""accordian-shaped"" peice at the bottom near the bottom of the stairs, it will have a black horn-shaped peice attached to it. Unhook it from the arm that connects to it (i actually unhooked the arm also so it wasn't just flopping around in there) and voila, no more squeaky penguins!Now the stairs that take the penguins up is still a bit loud, but not nearly as annoying as *squeak* *squeak* *squeak* *squeak* *squeak* *squeak* *squeak* *squeak* *squeak* *squeak* *squeak* *squeak* *squeak* *squeak* *sq...ok you get the idea."
4,Penguin fun,"I gave this toy to my niece for her fifth birthday. I wasn't actually expecting big things from it. I just thought it would be a bit of fun for five minutes. But my niece loves it. Not only that, my three-year-old nephew keeps insisting she turn it on so he can watch the penguins, and my one-year-old niece could not stop giggling when she saw the penguins do their thing. All-in-all it has been a success for all. Definitely the noise is a bit irritating, but not as bad as I expected."
4,"Fun, but noisy.","My three-year-old son requested and received this for Christmas after seeing it on the Baby Beethoven DVD. He loves it! It does make a terribly annoying sound that is pretty loud, though (I guess you don't hear that on the Baby Einstein movies!!!). My husband was able to put it together easily. It seems fairly durable, although the sign on the top of the escalator is cardboard and bends easily."
3,Daughter Loved It,We purchased this toy for my daughter (3yrs old) who absolutely loves penguins. She has wanted to play with it continuously. The only issue the rest of the family has with this toy is it is loud and a bit annoying after a while. She loves the motion of the penguins. An off button for the sound would have been great.
1,"This deserves 0 stars. Horrible, not worth a buck.","The angles of the tracks on this toy are not steep enough for the penguins to roll by themselves. You have to babysit them i.e. push them along, to keep them rolling. Horrrible product and does not perform as described."
5,Super fun!,"Reminds me of the original version that I played with at my Grandma's house 25 years ago! Very simple, but so entertaining to watch. Daughter will play with it for hours."
4,Fun toy,"Love the toy, my kids are very tough on toys, not sure if it's going to last long. It is great fun for the 2-3 year old.Good buy for $10. More entertaining than an action hero."
4,l'odeur du vent-roberto de brasov,"A warm and tasteful cd, a mixture of romanian gypsy music and improvising jazz-great!!!!!!!!"
2,"An Interesting, if one-sided, take","There was some interesting material on Ronan and Boyzone, but it was heavily biased in Ronan's favor, as if Boyzone would have been another interesting wannabe if Ronan hadn't been part of the group. If you want to know Ronan's story, I would suggest you buy his book; it approaches the same material in much greater depth and with a great emphasis on the contributions of all the band members. I am personally sorry I wasted my money on this."
4,PreKorn,"Although it is obviously not as good as Korn is, it is still very good stuff. Can definately hear the metal influences and some Red Hot Chili Peppers in there."
4,jessicka says,"this is a sick cd. i like this. if they only had jon singing it would be better, cause the lead singer has the kind of voice that sticks in yer head. the annoying voice, and you can't get rid of it. i like the guitar riff(s). but this singer can't sing"
3,KoRn's Roots,"This is a good addition for anyone has a KoRn CD collection. L.A.P.D. was the name that KoRn went by before they picked up Jon Davis and Brian Welch. While the music is raw and the low end guitar sounds are missing, I would recommend this CD to any KoRn fan."
1,Terrible,"I Love Korn. David Silvera is a great drummer, Fieldy has a great style of bass playing, which I am disapointed because his style isn't found here and James ""Munky"" Shaffer is a great guitarist.Simply stated....I wouldn't recomend LAPD to anyone. Even the biggest Korn fan. It's mostly a Funk-Rock cd. A few of the songs are 4/10. The rest are 0/10 for me."
1,do not buy this cd,"This is the worst cd I own. Do not i repet do not buy this cd. I thought it would be a good cd because it had munky,feildy,and david from KoRn, but it is a very bad cd. Don't buy it."
4,Love Libby Roderick,"Used to have a tape of this album but no longer a tape player. Besides, I played it so much the tape was getting wobbly I love what Libby espouses."
2,Nostalgic but not very useful...,"I bought this book hoping for some insight that might be useful for my career. I like and often use Gerr's ""Element's of Boat Strength"", but found surprisingly little useful information here. If you are a layman or one of the ""nautically obsessed"", you may enjoy it, though. But, if you want bare-bones useful info for building, get ""Elements of Boat Strength""..."
1,A tremendous held if you are actually designing a boat,"I am starting construction of a 40ft motorsailer of my own design. Daves book was a major help in the overall principles and the nut and bolt details such as propeller size and pitch, shaft size, rigging strength, and almost every other consideration in the design. I am ordering his ""Boat Systems Mechanical Handbook...""to fill in more of the design.Grant Jones, Bremerton, WA"
4,Lots of Information,"This is a book filled with detailed information about boats and boat design. What is covered is well explained; however, the overall approach is scattered. The initinal chapters just seem to wander about from one boat design story to another, and then the author even diverts to ""mystery"" story telling in the style of Mike Hammer. The author uses a lot of math, but it is not presented in a high flown manner which is often done by those who are good at math. The math explanations are not only straight forward, but they are always set up in a way that applies the math to the real world of boats and boat design. The math helps the reader see why certain boats behave in certain ways.Overall this book will enhance the knowledge of anyone who owns a boat but does not have a degree in boat design. Very useful."
4,Fun Reading for Boat Nuts,While not as technical (unfortunately) as the author's The Elements of Boat Strength it does contain a wealth of information for the curious. The book is a collection of magazine articles but Mr. Gerr must have done a lot of editing-they flow together nicely. Quite readable.
2,Expected better...,"This book picks up after Scheherazade, the teller of a thousand and one tales, is set free by the king. She is given a comfortable palace and the title of ""Storyteller of the Kingdom."" What follows next is a strange tale about a stranger who comes to visit Scheherazade's palace, whom she does not care for, and how she decides to take a trip into the desert to be free of him. However, she has no idea what adventure the desert holds for her. I was pretty disappointed by this work. I found all the stories within a story confusing, and the ending left too much questions unanswered. However, it did have many interesting twist and turns, but I don't think this is one of the best fairy tale offshoots."
3,Beautiful but frustrating,"I thought this ring was beautiful, so my husband bought it for me. It came in a gold box without any instructions. I pulled the tag off and the little piece of twine and ended up with a three day mess. We read directions and watched video. Finally, my husband's uncle, Bobby Attaway, put it back together. I am having it sodered asap. I don't need jewelry puzzles to keep me occupied. I am a youth minister's wife, I have a six year old, and I teach middle school. I have enough puzzles a day. My jewelry should be attractive and simple. I do love my ring."
4,ring,"Ring came quickly, nice condition. Extremely important to keep together, very hard puzzle to put back together and no solution comes with the ring. Ring solutions can be found on line by googling but have to try several to find one that works for particular ring."
2,Don't take the string off!,"I am very disappointed with this ring. It is very pretty, but once you take the string off it falls apart and there are no instructions to put it back together. My husband and I have been trying to put it back together based on the picture of the ring on this website and have had NO luck. Now all I have is a pile of silver rings that I cannot wear. If anyone knows how to put this back together, please post how! Thanks."
4,you tube solution is way easier!!!!!,Youtube the solution!!!!!! there is a video that is less then 1 minute long and very simple. I spent 2 hours trying to solve the ring with the instructions in the first review..... I solved it on my first try after watching the youtube video.
4,Beautiful,"I have never seen such a nice design 4 band puzzle ring as this. However, when u disassembled it, the interior was not polished at all ( dull grey). Overall, It was a nice design and I have fun putting it back! Solutions can be easily found on youtube video. Slightly thick band for slim fingers like mine but it will suit nicely on third finger or larger finger."
3,Pretty but a pain in the butt,"I love this ring, but bought it without realizing it's a puzzle. I had to get my boyfriend (who loves puzzles) to put it together for me, then he used a hot glue gun to keep it together, temporarily. I suppose it's not the company's fault, I just wish I'd read the reviews of it before I purchased it, instead of after. Just be aware that this ring comes apart and will do so every time you take it off."
3,"cool, but once it's apart...","This was a gift and is a lovely ring. Without thinking, I cut the thread holding it together, but managed to get another on there before it came apart. That thread lasted about two months, and now it is apart in my jewelry box, waiting for me to try the solution another reviewer posted. I hope it works!"
2,"Ring's Ok, service is crummy","The ring itself was pretty and sturdy, but beware what size you order because despite using a sizing chart, the actual puzzle rings never come in the right size. I wasted a lot of time and money trying to get the right size because the customer service was really slow and unhelpful. Unlike some better puzzle ring websites I've seen, this one didn't offer any guides or suggestions for choosing the correct ring size."
1,it sucked,it tarnished on the first day and broke on the third day. It is in the trash where it belongs
1,Not Worth It,"I bought three of these rings for my sisters and I, and only one of them is in tact! I have only had these for three days. They fall apart really easily and are impossible to put back together. Save your money and your sanity... if puzzle is in the title its probably not a good idea."
3,FRUSTRATING,"Now we see why the maker is called Silver Insanity. We bought the ring and it came today - it was beautiful. I took the rope binding the ring off and it came apart nearly instantly. We have been working on putting it back together for 3 hours. There is no answer key with the ring, and apparently no key on the web. The maker will not take it back if it has been separated. So if anyone knows how to put the dang thing back together, please email dunnhorn@yahoo.com"
4,Beautiful ring,"The ring looks exactly like the picture shown, and after a brief cleaning it fit together easily. The one sent to me was easily a size larger than I had ordered however - perhaps it was a fluke. I'm still going to keep it though. :)"
3,nice,again just when you start bobben your head to another artist the music musics off.you like dam but quik keeps it going if you know what i mean quik fans yall know from oh10
5,No one can compare,"I dont have much to say, but if you like rap music, this is a must own. I have been a big DJ Quik fan for quite some time now,and this was the third album I purchased by him. Every track is not only excellently produced, but the rhymes are extremely well delivered and funny. I think Quik is the best rap artist of all time. Nuff Said."
3,yeah it does fit tight,I needed help with this one. The holes match on the sides but the two under the bumper were off a bit. I had to take it off and hone out the holes to get it to fit. It does fit but it will need a little tweeking.Only three stars cuz I need to tweek the holes. ohh I put it on a Equinox 09
3,great ornament but ..,"Color isn't a true christmas green. More like teal.But, I am happy cuase I can still use it for something else."
5,Great quality and a great price,These earrings are even better looking in person. You can't beat the quality for the price! They are beautiful earrings.
4,Beautiful Earrings,"I love these earrings! They are the perfect size. My only complaint is that the stones have inclusions, but you cannot tell without REALLY looking close."
5,Just beautiful!,"I just love these earrings! they are high quality, solid with silver. The price can't be beat either! I would recommend these to anyone."
2,Not transcendent,"A primarily pretentious affair reeking of pseudo-edginess , obnoxious instrumentation, and off-key musical illiteracy. That is not to say that in between certain cracks of space, sparingly throughout this indie mess, there are not a few moments that possibly grip-the attempted raga's do their best to engage without pummeling listeners over the head with how ""different"" it is (at best, as in the bombastic second half of track 9, the band comes across like a cheap Godspeed knockoff), but on the whole this is one of those album's that you end up becoming embarrassed owning in retrospect."
1,Construction Destruction,Game would not load - screen repeatedly came up to trial version completed - if you want to buy for 19.99 order here. No phone number to call. Website deadend. Very frustrating!!!! Don't waste your money.
1,Don't bother,"This is suppose to be a cheap, simple kids game. It isn't any game at all. The control buttons don't work, and it quickly crashes my computer. (I have a P4 with XP that works well on everything else). There is no exit button, and control/alt/delete will not even get me out of this mess. So, I have to turn off the power to my computer (not a good thing), just to get out of it. I downloaded the patch for it. It doesn't help. This is another ""value soft"" product that seems to mean garbage, doesn't work, don't bother, and buy something else."
3,Good value for the money,Its a good value for the money but probably won't see a ton of use in my tool rotation. As another reviewer mentioned 2 critical missing pieces. No magnet to hold steel screws in place for one handed driving. No detente to lock in quick change chucks. On the plus side I now have several sizes I didn't have before.
3,Decent at best,"I cant complain because of how cheap this set is, but that beeing said here are the cons; no magnets, cant lock on to an impact. Enough said"
5,tools,These nut drivers can save you loades an loades of time on jobs and make them a whole lot easyer.
4,great when you travel a lot,"Pro:Price, organized and small to carry around.Comes with both SAE and MM, perfect when you need a nut or bolt.Don't have to carry a set of nut drivers which take up lots of space for all those sizes.Con:Doesn't have lock/release tip and not magneticCan't ask for too much for 5$"
3,No Indents!,This is a nice little set except for one thing....There are no indents on the shafts to keep the bits in the quick change holders on a power driver. They would work fine in a magnetic tip screwdriver that accepts interchangeable bits.
2,"No magnets, no detent in shaft.","This could have been a nice set, however, it's usefulness is severely limited by two things. First, the bits do not have a detent in the shaft to lock them into a power driver, so the only way to keep them from falling out is to put them in a magnetic extension, and even then if enough torque is applied to lock them on to a bolt they tend to pull out of the extension. Secondly there is no magnet in the bits to hold a nut while placing it."
3,So - So,"I didn't notice until I got this set shipped, there is no detent to hold the bit in place with an impact driver, making it difficult to use in drivers without a regular chuck..... But for the price they are not bad."
2,Two Big Flaws,"To keep it simple, there are 2 flaws that should convince you to look elsewhere.First, there's no cutout for locking chucks, so use on 1/4"" Hex drivers is essentially worthless, (point it down & the bit falls out). For those prone to swearing & throwing things, these are not for you.Second, no magnet, (no explanation needed here)."
3,Should have looked more closely at the description,In my work I need magnetic nut drivers these are not. My fault I should have made sure they were before adding them to the cart.. I do like the plastic case and the length of the sockets.
4,great value,I bought this to keep in the case with my drill and other accesories. works well for the price !
3,Average,I would recommend spending a little more and get a magnetic set. They aren't much more money and are useful! The holder holds the bits a bit too tight. I end up having to use needle nose to get them out of the dang holder.
3,"These are primitive, decent backups for driving","The price is right for these drivers. They're not high quality, no magnets, but they'll work in a pinch. I keep them as a backup set to my backup set, I believe in redundancy. 2 is 1, 1 is none.They're very compact, but I'd like the included belt holder to have a tighter grip on the drivers, they slip out pretty easily. All in all, a decent value for a driver set that won't be called on for heavy duty. I wouldn't want to rely on these every day, but they'll work for most homeowners and as backups to your professional set."
2,Useless,"Total waste of money! 1/4"" Hex Shanks are suppose to have a groove in the stem to hold them in place. To short for my cordless drill and doesn't hold in my cordless screwdriver. So they are useless to me. Thought I might have something to extend the shank, but no luck"
3,Good in a pinch....,"All the reviews are accurate, if you are looking for quick change bits for your impact driver, don't look here cause they don't have the detent that holds them in place. For the cost of admission it is a good product to have in case you come across an odd size."
3,just one problem,"These bits are ok except for one major design flaw. The shaft does not have the notches that keep the bits in my Makita impact driver. They fall out while in use.RBAsheville, NC"
3,Description needs to be updated,"I submitted an update product information to Amazon.com to include ""(no detent)"" right after the 1/4 inch universal hex shank description. There was a picture of the same product on Amazon.com which did not contain the hex shank in the description, so I thought this was different. I am not a big tool guy, but I assumed universal hex shank meant it had a detent. I have bought other drive nut sets that included in the decription that it had hex shanks which included detents. I will probably keep this set because of the various sizes included."
1,Missing detent,"Wish I had read the other reviews, they don't have a detent on them so they are useless if you are trying to use them for cordless impact drivers or even a nut driver handle (I picked them up from the ""Other Customers Also Bought"" link when I bought my impact)."
5,"Beautiful, highly durable sled - and zippy, too!","I've tried several kinds of reclining sleds, but this one is my hands-down favorite. For one thing, it can take a spill or two and not get damaged. It's varnished, not painted, so you can see the wood grain. The birch rails are a nice touch, too. It's super stable, and turns very nicely, which is good, because this thing is FAST! Loads of fun - when we go sledding, this is the sled that everbody wants to use."
1,poor quality,The top steering portion came off on the first day of use. The screw is exposed and we can hear the rattling under the plastic cover that presumably is the nut. Very disappointing for an expensive sled. Will definitely return this product.
1,Looks cool but is not a great sled,"The sled looks really cool on the pictures but they are a little deceiving. The craftsmanship of the product was subpar and had many flaws including: Finger prints in the lacquer finish, the bolt holes in the handle didn't even come close to lining up with the corresponding holes in the sled, and many of the metal spacers for the side rail were loose. The design of the bottom plastic sliding surface was also too deep and would have dug into soft snow too much and created issues. I also ordered the Mountain Boy Slalom sled which has a much better design but also had some of the same craftsmanship flaws. I am keeping the Slalom sled and returning this one. I wanted a higher end product and was willing to spend the money to get the Mountain Boy name and reputation but was a little disappointed in the overall quality of the product. Too bad too because this could be such a great product with better quality control and design."
5,"re-discovered sledding with this ""real"" sled","I've had one for these past 2 winters and just ordered another for my nephews. I think if I had one of these as a kid, I might never have gotten hooked on skiing. I'm finally able to maneuver around obstacles and go fast at the same time!We visited Silverton, Colorado and tried one out at the little ski area there. We were actually able to run a slalom course (while laughing our heads off).I was worried about the heaviness of this thing, but the black bottom slides so smoothly, I haven't had any trouble tugging it up the hills. We picked this one because it is long enough for adults too.Mountain Boy Sledworks Ultimate Flyer 52-Inch Sled"
1,"Cheap, Chinese-made Sled","This sled is not what it pretends to be. It's poorly made in China and not worth the money. The side grab rails are downright dangerous; they are too narrow and can trap and break fingers. Top of wood is super slippery - good luck staying on it if you don't add sticky tape or something. The only reason to buy this sled is if you plan to sled on loose snow, which doesn't really work out anyhow."
2,Look elsewhere,The holes didn't line up to mount the steering bar. Might be acceptable on a 20 dollar sled but a 100 dollar sled. Get the quality right. Back it goes.
1,Poor quality.,"I received the sled and immediately found out the handle holes don't line up. The instructions invite me to drill new ones if this happens. What?! They knowingly accept this defect? What else? I'm handy and have the tools, but am not going to bite. This junk is going back at their expense."
4,Good on packed surface,"This is a beautiful sled. We used it when the snow iced up do to melting. It was very safe as it was able to turn when the other sleds were controlled by gravity.When it snowed again it was not as good for the powder. It tended to dip in the front and the snow would go over the sled into your face. It was also slower than other sleds in the powder. As an adult this is a small sled and will tip sideways if you turn too fast. It is for laying down only!! I would buy a pad for it.Overall it was a great buy for the money spent. I don't really care that is made in China as that should be obvious do to the price, after all my Ipod is also made in China."
1,crap,"It is bull s***, false advertisement, waste of money, didn't even make a difference, make my engine sputter, no one else should buy this"
3,Item did not correspnd,"The toy itself was fine, but there was a mistake in the description and I was expecting another color. I kept it anyway."
5,Should be about 20 stars!,"This is a great book! I am on only about the 5th chapter and I am already learning a lot from it. I started reading it at work. The post where I was working (private security) when I started reading this was very cold, and definitely not very conducive to learning such things as differential/integral calculus. I still picked up the concepts he teaches very quick. Recommended reading for even Junior High readers to the doctor in math."
2,Over Rated!,"I don't understand why this book has such high ratings. It starts out good, but then loses it's consistency. It becomes rather difficult to understand early in the book. Like most all technical books, the more advanced the subjects become, the more horrible they explain them. I would recomend looking for a different book if your trying to learn calculus. I thought this book was terrible."
3,Not satisfied,If you are begining calculus this is probably not a goog book to start with. I am a college student and did not really like the book. The text used in my school is easier to understand. I feel i wasted my money.
3,"A boy, a sorcerer, a clock... Review by Bradd Nixon","I have read many books in my lifetime. I've read good books and bad books. If I had to rate this one I'd say it's around the middle. This book picks up pretty quickly and it turns out to be a ghost story. The beginning and middle are pretty juicy, but at the end things aren't very expplanatory and it loses a lot of flavor. If your'e looking for a quick easy read ghost story that's is not too scary, look into the House with a Clock in its Walls."
2,No Cigar....,"A bit boring, ho hum! Of the children I gave this to they would read a while and then find other things to do and then read a little more later. I read it - not enough to hold interest for any period of time and the artwork is strange - more adult. Give it to your child to read in between waiting for the good books to arrive. Okay, but!"
3,Not John Bellair's best... so far,"I'm about 3/4 of the way through this book, and so far I'm feeling a bit disappointed. I remember devouring every John Bellairs book I could get my paws on as a young girl, and with good reason. He is (was) one of the most engaging children's authors around. Now in my twenties, I began craving that long ago high I used to experience every time I picked up a Bellairs.So far, this book has failed to captivate me the way every other of his offerings have. I'm hopeful that things will turn around in the last 1/4 of the book, and I have enough respect for his writing that I'm willing to finish the book to give it the benefit of the doubt. I hope I am not disappointed...."
3,The House With a Clock in its Walls Book Review,"The House With a Clock in its Walls was a well written book. John Bellairs did a very good job with details and describing, but this book is not on a topic I like. You would only be able to enjoy this book if you really like magic and witchery which I personally dislike. The book is not much more than a short story of a witches' battle that could probably be much shorter, but I have to give it to John, he sure can write. If you like short books with not much actual meat this book is for you. Overall Bellairs did a okay job."
3,TIME FLIES BOOK: THE HOUSE WITH A CLOCK IN ITS WALLS,"BY Edd McmanIn an attempt to make friends with a boy named Tarby, Lewis Barnavelt uses his Uncle who is a wizard to do some magic. But Lewis wants a little more so he does some magic and he does it well. Then weird things begin to happen. Then Lewis finds the fate of the world in his hands.Good Beggining, decent middle, weak end."
4,Scary kidlit,"For all who might argue that this is a rehash of Lemony Snicket, J.K. Rowling, or whomever, can we just remember that this book predates them all by at least two decades? This is genuinely creepy adolescent fiction, and if your child is prone to nightmares, I wouldn't let her have it at age 10. It's also a moral story (in a way that Harry Potter has never been) about our infinite capacity to do evil without meaning to, and the terrifying responsibility that doing so entails to try to right things. Harry might suffer the usual case of teenaged angst, but Lewis really has done a terrible thing, out of questionable motives, and his guilt and misery really resonate with children who know that they have the potential to do the same. And yet he prevails, in the face of real terror. Give it a try; Bellairs is good and Gorey's illustrations are classic."
5,Conditioner for Everyday,This conditioner works so well for folks who wash their hair every day from necessity. The ends still get dry.Apply this just to the ends -- it's quick -- you'll like it.
3,Suicidal birds of a feather flock together,a suicidal guy falls for an even more suicidal girl . it's a dark comedy . Natasha lyonne character is sweet cute and innocent....well not really innocent. this movie was too cute and happy for the storyline . the ending should have been different so that there could have been more emphasis on the fact that he would still have decided to live with or without her . i wasn't happy with the ending. If u want a bubbly romantic movie thats unique and has a happy ever after ending then this is the movie for you . If not ...then at least it has Natasha lyonne in it . mpfh this movies too cute for my taste .I give it 3 stars becuz it has Natasha lyonne in it and becuz it's different
3,More complicated than it needs to be,"The screws are a little too short considering they want you to screw them in at an angle. If you are installing it with out the TV in the way, it shouldn't be a problem, but with the TV or anything else in the way, it's near impossible considering you have to install the screws at such a weird angle, and only one one side of the pieces. I prefer the covers that have a base piece, and a top cover piece."
3,Somewhat functional,"The manner in which the product attaches to the wall is asinine. The attachment screws have to go in at such an extreme angle that I had to predrill holes in the wall for them, and it is just sheetrock! Even with the predrilled holes, the screws did not want to start and, after checking the first one, they do much more damage to the wall than a straight in attachment would. That being said, it is an attractive system that is highly functional due to the variety of corner pieces provided. I gave it three stars because it does what it claims it will do, and I did not give it the last two stars because it required more work than other systems I have used and because it will require much more repair work when it is taken down."
2,Incompatible with EMI copy-protected CDs,"I purchased this in New Zealand, and since discovered that EMI copy-protected discs will *not* play at all. CD screen just displays ""ooops""!!!Philips claim that these EMI discs do not adhere to original CD spec and so this is just tough news for me, and I need to take it up with EMI. Never heard anything back from EMI.Therefore insert copy-protected disc into CD, hold down shift-key, copy your purchased ""useless CD"" and this Nike Philips CD player will play perfectly!!!Be warned!"
1,Phyllis Diller's Household Hints,I have always loved Phyllis Diller - but this book was just awful. I couldn't even finish it all. Very boring and verypredictable.
3,Humor that will largely be lost on the modern reader,"Phyllis Diller is a comedian where the changing role of males and females has rendered her comedy routines to the area of marginally funny. Her basic pitch in this book is that of the housewife that engages in every possible way to dodge the doing of housework. Given that there are so few traditional housewives any more, the jokes she makes about being a lazy housewife come across as being archaic. Furthermore, in many households a male is now doing a great deal of the childcare and housework. Finally, the modern single mother will find it difficult to relate to the environment of full-time wife and mother that Diller's jokes presuppose. Therefore, when the jokes are presented in the absence of the context of Diller delivering them, they are just not funny."
3,Short on advice - long on gorgeous pictures,I've followed Moser's name as a woodworker since way back in the early days of a black-and-white Fine Woodworking magazine. At the time I was a struggling woodworker who was a bit amazed (and a bit jealous) at how Moser was able to build such a successful business. This book documents that rise and examines how the company functions today with Moser in a more administrative role. It's a book as much about a company as it is about a person.Frankly I don't think there's much of a mass appeal to the story of the rise of T. Moser Cabinetmakers but I will say that the book is filled front to back with photos of some of the most beautiful furniture there is. This will make a great addition to any woodworker's library or to any coffee table. It's certainly a book that you want to thumb through. It's kind of a book for the choir and if you're in the choir you'll likely love it.
3,Quick Read with Some Reasonable Angles,"I read the book in about 1-1/2 hours two nights ago. The author is not a skilled writer. Like a lot of horse racing books, he repeats certain information far too much. The book is also small and thin (starts on page 11 and ends on page 82 with blank and significantly less than full pages between. I will not agree with the author with respect to Martingale betting and in over simplifications regarding professional, rational and irrational bettors. The book appears to have been written over a two week period in November 2004.I think there are some reasonable points raised with respect to ideas such as wagering on Belmont Stakes (bettors caught up in hype), types of races to look for (e.g. 3+ yo vs. 2 & 3 yo), and strategies for certain types of races (e.g. MCl and MSW races). Many books I have read advocate avoiding horses higher than 5:1, but the author has some ideas for higher odds horses (not tried). He also tries to tie the ideas together at the end."
2,"Some good ideas, but incomplete","The text of the book is decent; I got some ideas for money management from it. The trouble is that the book relies heavily on graphs, but ALL graphs are missing. Every one. Until that's fixed, I can't recommend the book. After that's fixed, it's a quick read that might give you a few ideas for handicapping heuristics & money management."
1,Don't waste your Money,"The Author Mark E. Ripple clearly does NOT know what he's talking about. ""Handicapping the Wall Street Way"" is a great example of an author clearly way out of his league. He boasts and rationalizes why he is winning certain races, and quite frankly has no idea what he's talking about. If your in finance and wondering..... is it worth reading....don't even bother reading this awful excuse for a book on handicapping.... It can only hurt your money management at the track. One would think that a savvy wall street guru would be able to use variance and standard deviation as a measure of risk in a horse race?"
5,CD of the Recording of Christmas with Marty Robbins,Totally satisfied with this product and it is GREAT. Sound quality is excellent and the total product does not disappoint.
5,Greatest Music,"Marty Robbins was the Greatest singer God gave to the world along with Johnny Horton, Eddy Arnold Jim Reeves and Pasty Cline"
2,Didn't live up to expectations,"I found this to be a pedestrian effort at Christmas Music, not original or upbeat. The quality of the CD was below average, and it came with no liner notes.If you want classic country Christmas music look to Hank Thompson, Eddy Arnold, Randy Travis or Buck Owens.Most Christmas music reviews are of the 'I listened to this when I was a kid and was thrilled to find it on CD here's 5 stars yadda yadda' variety. I completely understand this type of review, but they're not very helpful.I just wanted solid, mid 60's sounding country Christmas music, avoid this CD unless you are a Marty Robbins fan."
1,Beware,"this dvd player has been replaced twice by the seller and the product still does not function, I have been unable to contact the manufacturer to get it fixed. A search on the net only reveals old information. Probably out of business or bought out by some other company. Please don't waste your money, purchase a different product from a known reputable manufacturer."
1,total problems,I bought this for my daughters Christmas. The both showed up broken and inoperable. There was no reply when trying to get the product fixed.
2,"Good Concept, but Disappointing","I love the IDEA of this book -- what seafood is eco-friendly and how to cook it. The book contains numerous short essays about poor fisheries-management and suggestions about less harmful practices, and these are nice. But in terms of practical advice on fish-buying, the authors are trying to avoid all negativity and don't help the reader distinguish truth from fiction at the fish-mongers. And some of the fish varieties discussed can only be distinguished from look-alikes by DNA testing. Also, the recipes are all very fancy and beautiful but way too fussy (how many words does it take to say ""salt and pepper""?) Overall, the book is an expensive indulgence (think coffee-table), but not too useful."
2,Difficult Zipper,This is a very well constructed case BUT the the large tooth zipper sticks badly which is annoying.
3,Souther boy,"It was an informative read and interesting, but I think there is a lot more information out there to be found. Overall, it kept my attention focused."
4,Estate Planning and Trust information,This book has practical information about estate planning and how to set up trusts to protect your loved ones. I borrowed this book from the local library and thought enough of it to want to order it for myself.
2,Grandfather's Greatest Hits,"A little disappointed. Thought it would be a CD, but was a cassette, which I already had. Arrived promptly, though."
4,Works Good.,This is a very good alternator that is diffidently worth the value. Plus it looks good sitting on my engine. Would have gave it 5 stars but the Head lights seem to dim a tad for just a split second after I tap the brakes or any other sudden use of electricity. This didn't happen with the stock one. Nothing to complain about though. Great Product!! GET IT!!
3,Holy cow this thing is bright,"I bought this to read while my boyfriend was sleeping.- It clips on easily and securely.- It maneuvers very well into lots of positions, and HOLDS said position for a long time.- It has an attractive design.- But holy cow this thing is BRIGHT. If I wanted a light that bright, I would flip on my ceiling light. I meant for this to be discreet so I could read falling asleep without irritating my bf, but the super-bright light defeats the purpose of a discreet book light. Minus 2 stars for the overkill luminosity."
3,Nice light but poorly designed neck,"Casts a nice, bright light; unit is small and lightweight; but the flexible goose-neck needs some backbone! - terribly ""floppy"" - will not hold to the position you set/desire. Bottom line: excellent light, terrific price, but poor execution make this only a so-so product... and hence a disappointment."
2,Too bright. Battery swapping requires tool.,"I may sound lazy, but it's a pain having to use a screwdriver to swap out the batteries. With a 10-hour battery life this isn't all that often, but can happen mid-trip where you may not have access to a screwdriver.More importantly, it is TOO BRIGHT!!!! It lights up the whole room, defeating its purpose and keeping up anyone who may be trying to sleep while you read."
1,Fragile and short battery life,"Used this light for 4 days, 3 or 4 hours each time. I had to change the battery twice because the light seemed to get dimmer after only a few hours of use. It was barely bright enough with a fresh battery. On day five I dropped the light while attempting to clip it onto my book. It only fell about 3 feet to the floor and the hinge broke--it didn't just come apart, it actually broke a piece off. The light is worthless without a working hinge, so I tossed it into the trash."
2,Wasted my money,"Bought this to use with my Kindle but it's not worth the money. Does not give out enough light and you cannot light the entire page without some glare. I will buy another light, maybe one with two led lights."
4,"great little light, but short battery life","Arrived quickly, and is really cute. Works great, though will last only 10 hours, then I assume will need new watch batteries. Hope these are common and easy to find. I'm handicapped and have very few opportunities to go shopping.Over all, I'm pleased with this light. I was amazed at how much light it gives out. I left out a star due to the short time it will work."
5,Not just a book light,"Since I received this product I've used it to read hard cover novels (with paper back you have to clip it to multiple pages) and its works great. Right now I have it clipped to my notebook computer. Earlier I used it as a flashlight. Its light enought to carry anywhere, brighter than some flashlights and it can be clipped My 6 yr old uses it to get around the house at night. Battery hasn""t run out and I use it everyday but I had ordered extra batteries with the light because it was cheaper than at the store. This little light really comes in handy."
5,I love this little light!,"I love this little light. I bought it for my daughter for Christmas and she has only used it a couple of times. Not anything to do so much with the product but with the fact that books are now competing with Kindles, Ipods, ect."
4,Excellent book light,Clips onto most books firmly and flexible neck swivels for ease of reading. Clear blue led light illuminates nicely. Great for reading anywhere extra light is needed.
5,Just right light,Light is bright but it can be aimed to only illuminate the book so it does not disturb my wife. The switch has worked with no problem. The batteries have lasted longer than expected.
5,light,another first class service and just as advertised energiser led book light is great what a difference it makes to my reading
3,Wish it had a couple brightness settings,I use this book light with my Kindle. It's much brighter than it needs to be. I wish it had a couple brightness settings (which would save battery life as well).
4,Awesome product!,"It's a great light, I use it for both my kindle and regular books. It is very bright but just enough so it doesn't bothers you in complete darkness.Also gave one to my father as a gift for his kindle and he uses it every night to read in his bed. It doesn't bothers people around you.Overall a nice purchase. I would have gone for the kindle case with a light included but got the one without the light as a gift. It is also a little bulky to carry with at all times, but makes a great companion for your nighttime reading and also when traveling on a plane or train where you have something to carry it with.My personal recommendation, get it if you already have a kindle case, if not, go for the kindle case with light included."
3,Works TOO good,"This thing is BRIGHT. So if you want it for the purpose of reading in bed without disturbing your spouse or baby, good luck. I have a three month old who sleeps in our room and this thing lights up half the room...I did put some painters tape over it to tone it down and now it works great."
3,Decent travel reading light,"Works well. Useful. The light is a little bright and not ""leak proof"" so my husband is not happy when I try to sneak in a couple more minutes of reading before bed."
4,Handy Little Light,"I was initially worried because when I first got this it was buggy about turning on. I would have to slide the switch back and forth a few times before it would come on (and stay on.) After the first day or so I haven't had this problem any more. Maybe it just needed a little breaking in. This isn't the brightest book light I've used, but it serves its purpose. The clip allows it to be clamped onto your book or laptop. The thickest thing that I've tried clipping it on was about .5""-.75"" thick so you'll at least be able to clamp it to something like that. I'm not really sure it'll take much more. Not sure about the battery life since I just got it and haven't used it too much yet. Overall good light for the price."
1,Waste of money,The light never really worked too well. And then it died altogether within abou 2 weeks. Not worth the time tos end back. A waste of money.
3,Great light but impractical for a kindle,"This light is very bright and works great for reading in dark spaces, however I purchased it to use with my kindle and the base is so big that when it clamps onto the kindle it blocks some of the screen. It also twists and falls off the kindle because it is heavy. So great for paper books but not kindles!"
2,Lame,"This is not sturdy, kind of a pain to switch it's orientation when you turn the page. Maybe it would work better with a book, i was reading magazines. Also didn't like the quality of the light."
1,All GLARE,"Energizer LED Book LightSAVE YOUR MONEY. If you plan to use with your Kindle, forget about iT! It produced the kind of glare that prevents from reading. The clip is too big to clip to the top of the Kindle. It's a plastic clip to a plastic Kindle - just slips off! I can't find anything positive unless you plan to use with print material. I know iit cost only $6 but the time and tape necessary to return is considerably more than $6. DON'T BUY!!"
1,JASBO Book light,I purchased this book light from JASBO and thought I was purchasing an Energizer book light but instead received a cheap book light that looks like it can be purchased at your local dollar store. The product had nothing to do with Energizer. I can't speak for the other sellers who claim to be selling an Energizer book light but I can guarantee that this company is involved with false advertisement. They post a picture of an Energizer book light then they send out a cheap book light. Just wanted to let others know so this doesn't happen again.
4,Still Good James,"Though nothing like the band has really done with Gold Mother-and-on, Strip-Mine still has some formidable entrees with the gentle ""Stripmining"" and the jazzy, upbeat ""Charlie Dance"". Worth a look for fans."
2,Disappointed,"I'm a bit puzzled by the overall positive reviews on this chrono. Two poor design issues - 1. The top info (Date/Day) or in Chrono (split time) are hard to see and partly hidden. 2. The chrono split and Stop/Start buttons are very small so...if you running (or whatever) you really have to concentrate to hit them. Not ideal. Also, the watch is not all that 'bright' - hard to read. I've had really good Timex in the past... not this one."
5,Just what the doctor ordered!,"Just what was expected. It has the perfect set of features. This is my third Triathlon. Each of the first two lasted so long I couldn't remember how many years I had been wearing them. The second one is still working, but I've beaten it up so badly over the years the writing is all worn off and the crystal is badly scratched. The new one has a sleek look and shouldn't catch protruding buttons on things like my old one did occasionally. You go Timex!"
2,"Not bad, but not great","This isnt a bad gun, for a beginner. it is vey accurate , but VERY delicate i bought this gun on january 26, and it came by the 5 of febuary. The gun doesnt hurt but gives a sting, you can hit a person from over 100 feet away. within the first week i sold it to an airsoft buddy for 50$ but the day he tested it and used it in battle the magazine broke leaving me with only a CO2 pistol(wich is one of the best side arms)overall i would recomend it but be carefull with it"
3,MP5 SD3,"I was expecting a different type of weapon when it arrived. You are only able to fire one shot at a time, whereas the one I thought I was buying had an automatic feature. It was never spelled out in the description. I know for next time."
1,Do Not Buy From AirSplat!!!!!,"If you would like this gun, which has gotten alot of good reviews then I strongly recommend you buy it from anybody other than AirSplat. I purchased this gun for my son's Christmas 2011 and AirSplat said it was in stock, acknowledged the order, sent me a tracking #, and charged my card. Problem is they never shipped the gun! Got an email the day after I was billed saying the tracking number had been rescinded and now the gun was out of stock and wouldn't be available until after Christmas. Then they wouldn't return my emails and only after I filed a claim through Amazon and threatened legal action did they finally issue a refund. I will never buy anything from AirSplat again and advise you to consider my experience if your interested in this gun."
5,The best spring gun money can buy,I bought this gun a one and a half years ago and I highly recommend it. It is very sturdy and can take a beating. The only problem I have is after I used it many times the silencer broke. It is still very effective without the silencer but does not look as cool. This gun is far better any other spring rifle or pistol.
2,Bad gun,This gun looks great in the pictures but its horrible. Its so flimsy that the scope broke within 5 minutes of me getting the gun. Because it is spring powered it shoots one pellet at a time so it is not a sub machine gun. It is basicly a oversized pistol. A cheap $5 shotgun is better than it. It is good for beginners but when it comes to airsoft veterns it is a gun that is just a waste of money.
2,clip sucks,On the second day the clip broke and you have to hold it up side down to fire and even then it migh not fire. Just save your self the troble and get a different mp5
4,Cool Great Gun,"It is a very acurate for 40 dollars. the silencer breaks easily and doesnt realy help.Its hard to reload so get a spead reloader.over all, its ok but makes an annoying noise when you fire it.its an amatures gun but it is good.I would sugest getting an electric, rechargable gun instead."
5,Amazing,"Best airsoft gun i own. I just got this gun today. It was nothing that i expected. IT WAS BETTER! It was so heavy and the plastic it is made out of is so durable. Dont get me started on the accuracy of it and the power! Please for your own good, BUY THIS GUN!"
4,;,"my friend has this gun and he shot me from pretty far away and it felt like 300 fps great gun and its just funn to hold cuase it feels so realistc. idk if its worht 40 dollars though, you as mine as well get the automatic version of it that goes 300 fps which is also 40 dollars"
1,this gun sux,"this gun sux.for one reason its got really low fps only like 40 fps and its made of cheap pastic.i would recomend this gun to people who like women who ride motorcycles and smoke in an alley behind a dumpster, but someone besides that ya ur gonna fail in an airsoft war. this gun i rated one star because its not very good but i like it because i just mess around with it so ya. for all u noobs out there i luv u."
1,Waste,Frist Of all i really wanted a Air soft Gun so i can play my friend who has a a automatic Gun as well but i cannot shot it! waste of time energy and money
1,THIS ITEM IS NOT AS ADVERTISED AND GOOD LUCK WITH RETURNING IT!!!!!!!,"We ordered this item because it was fully automatic. IT IS NOT AUTOMATIC!!!!! Although the instruction claim batteries can be inserted for automation, there is not place to put the batteries. I have been trying FOR WEEKS to return the item with an occasional email from airsplat claiming they need more information to process the return. I still have it in the original package sitting at my desk. Be careful when ordering from this company. Frankly, I expected more from Amazon."
2,Not the best- you get what you pay for...,"Cons: Did not like the very, very small characters on the display. You have to squint to read the display. The radio has terrible reception. The forward button does not forward fast enough for Podcast forwarding. Does not allow you to bookmark a spot on a Podcast. The nylon case does not have a belt clip. The side buttons need to be pressed too hard to use.Pros: I like the price and the capacity. But had to send back because of mainly the small character display..."
2,Think again about Buying this Headphone!!!,"I must say that the sound quality of this phone is really good. However, when it comes down to comfort this headphone is anything but comfortable. If you are a runner that likes to run for 1-2 hours and listen to music then I do not recommend this headphone. Not sure if the people who gave this a 5-star ratings have ever used this headphone, because once you use it for more than 30 minutes your ears will start burning. The headphone is strong, but that makes it rough on the ears. I am actually searching for a better heaphone (perhaps a Sennheiser that will satisfy all needs) as I am writing this review."
3,Great for newcomers (excuse the pun),"This book is a great introduction for girls and women who are new to erotic media, and is a great resource for them. However, for those who are a bit (or a lot) more seasoned, the book might not be helpful. Intended for those who have had little to no previous interaction with erotic media.A bit outdated, and contains (what seemed to me to be) shameless advertising: the author tends to push products that she herself is comfortable with, which is understandable, and very useful for women who have, again, little to no previous experience.Still, I learned a few things I didn't know and got clarification on some things I have been wondering about.Recommended for beginners; not recommended for those who already know their way around."
4,Not the Time-Life series I was expecting but very good!,"This was the 3 disk version ( I originally had the 2 disk version I had purchased off TV) and while most of the same songs are on here, not all of them are.Since others have listed the songs, I won't. But if you want the good old- fashioned Christmas music by the ones who sung them best- this is a great purchase."
2,Buy this only if you like 1940's 50's style music,"I found the song arrangements were more jazzy 40's, 50's style than traditional choir/orchestra Christmas styles of the 60's, 70's and 80's. I ended up listening to a radio station as background music for Christmas day, instead of the CD's."
5,Perhaps the BEST Christmas collection ever!,"Well thought out. Timeless classics. Pristine quality. If I could own only ONE christmes music collection, THIS WOULD BE IT!"
5,Awesome!,These two CD's have a great selection of Christmas favorites! I highly recommend this set to anyone who likes to listen to Christmas music.
4,An Excellent Compilation with One Annoying Flaw,"This is a great ""starter kit"" for anyone who wants to collect Christmas classics and have them on hand for the holidays. However, I cannot fathom why the cloyingly sweet ""Baby's First Christmas"" is included in the set. Whenever it comes on, my family and I dive for the stereo to advance to the next track."
5,Wild Horse Woman,"This is the best CD I have heard in years!If you don't buy Cds often and are looking for the best find , you found it! Even my kids love listening to it.We listen to it year 'round. So many choices so little time. If you buy this you will be completely satisfied. Trust me!"
5,The best classic christmas hits ever collected in one place,"Sometimes in life, something reminds us of the times that matter most. Quiet walks through the freshly fallen snow, joy-filled sleigh rides through the countryside with the one you love, and singing Christmas carols while sipping hot cocco by the crackling fire. All of these are special memories of those times. In my life I have found no better way to remind myself of these cherished moments, these beautiful snapshots of life's truest essence than this collection of holiday classics. There is enough holiday magic and warmth in these treasured recordings to melt the heart of even the most cold hearted Scrooge."
4,Excellent Value,"Great value. Recently moved office to 21st floor in downtown Mobile, AL and these high power binoculars give me an incredible view of all the port activity. Highly recommend!"
5,Instant spelling dictionary,This is a great book. This one is a replacement for one that has been used to the point it is held togather with tape and staples. I need this book. It workes great for me. Oh it's very eazy to use if you just want the correct spelling of a word. It does not give the definition of that word or how to use it.
5,use it all the time,"My mother bought me this book when I was in high school, and now I bought one for my grandson. I use it regularly, and would hate to be without it. You can locate any word within an inch either way if you can spell the first few letters."
3,Laptop carrying case,"lock broke on initial use. contacted manufacturer who assisted with breaking into case to obtain laptop. manufacturer provided new item per warranty, however, I incurred shipping charges for a defective item (left lock on case)."
4,great deal and timely!,"The case was just what I was looking for! There was a slight discrepancy from the description in the product I ordered (it said it was the 5"" depth model) but in review, the model number was the 4"" model so I got what I paid for. Thanks again."
5,Daddy,"Excellent book. Riveting, had to keep reading the end. One of the best that I have read by author Danielle Steele."
3,Daddy,"This was a better than average read but not one of Danielle Steele's best. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it for what it was. The plot was perhaps not to my taste in that I don't understand women (or indeed men) who want a bob each way in their marriage. The final outcome was just fine though and as always it was an easy read."
2,Not A Page Turner!,"After reading Silent Honor, A Pefect Stranger and many before, I thought I really loved Danielle Steel's books. But then...I read Fine Things and then Daddy, I didn't like all two of them. I noticed that in these three books, that someone leaves and then their spouse quickly remarries. Kind of the same plot over and over!I feel that her best book was The Promise, the characters ended up together at the end (GREAT BOOK!)Happy Readings!"
3,Not bad.,"I enjoyed ""Daddy"", especially because of it's original plotline--the trials of a single father. If you like Danielle Steel, you'll definitely like this one. The only thing that bothered me was that some of the characters seem stereotypical, especially the pregnant girlfriend and her family. The son is portrayed as an innocent pawn, and the girlfriend and her family are portrayed as ignorant, golddigging hicks. For one, it takes two to tango, and two, just because you live in a mobile home doesn't mean that you're automatically greedy and uncivilized. These characters didn't have to be Rhode Scholars or saints, but they should have had more depth to them."
5,A different look of how men deal,This book was the perfect example of what a man would have deal with when his wife leaves him with the kids instead of him leaving her. I was happy with the fact that DS made him work at it instead of having him say some meaningful things about the mother Sarah leaving and the kids accepting it and everything going smoothly we all know there are bound to be some troubles the perfect example is Ben the oldest son getting his girlfriend pregnant. I was REALLLY happy when the father Oliver got his second chance just like Sarah took hers I found myslef hating the mother for putting her children in that situation what kind of mother does that but on the other hand being a woman I understand her actions she wanted to know when was it going to be her turn? To live life without having to worry about kids and a husband or what to make to for dinner? I loved this book and I think everyone should read it.
5,A Story of Courage and Comittments in Father Figurers,"This book took a 360 degree turn on the image portrayed in the media today of men in all rolls of life. Contrary to today's' movies and advertisements, this book showed strong, intelligent, loving, caring and committed men in the father roll of their families.There are a number of turns in the plot that cause the reader to have to keep guessing as to the outcome of the situations and the end of the book. I found myself getting so angry with Sarah for her actions and decisions she made which affected each family member so painfully. Her children did not ask to be brought into the world and did not deserve the decision she made.The book is great as most of Ms. Steels' books are."
2,Not a good choice for my son...,"I loved this book until we got to the end... it just proved to my son that he should be able to sleep in my bed every night! He is entering a phase in which he's scared of everything at night, so I bought this for him to try to help get him past his new fears. I hoped that it would help him feel comfortable and safe in his own bed. I wish I had read through it myself before we read it together! The empathy that he feels for Little Mouse validates his concept that his bed is definitely not the place to be at night! It was a very sweet book, but a bit unpractical for parents with children who have nighttime fears."
3,"Very cute illustrations, not an engaging story","Change to FIVE STARSWish I had checked this book out in the library first. Love the colorful, cute illustrations, but the story is really lacking and quite uneventful. My son is already bored of it.Update: somehow after half a year, at almost 3, this is one of my son's fave books. I think its because Little Mouse ends up getting to sleep with Big Mouse in Big Mouse's bed on a night that he is hearing noises, which of course my son loves to do too. The pictures are really adorable even though they are mostly of the mouse's bedroom."
5,Great Book,This book is a wonderful book that I use in music class to talk about expression and early compositional techniques. Item arrived fast and exactly as expected. I would buy from this seller again!
5,so great,"i love bringing pies to family gatherings and these stands provide such a great way to display them and helps when table space is limited. i've been looking for pie stands for a while and am so glad i finally decided to take a ""risk"" and buy them online."
1,"poor picture quality, not very thorough","First off, this is a bootleg dvd-r transfer off an old early 90s videotape and is poor quality. Second, it is not very thorough; it mostly shows aerial views of each city with brief summaries. Rarely does the cameraman's feet set foot on the ground."
4,Enjoyable,"I have enjoyed the short, simple, pithy, daily thoughts, even though I am not Jewish. The entries are just long enough to give me something to ponder. And the exercises are uncomplicated, and helpful."
3,Iits not that good,"I didn't buy this from here but my brother has it, and I've seen him play it, the CONQUEST's graphics are well done, but the arcade mode sucks!!! because its like buying a used game because all of the old characters are unlocked excepted the 2 characters from the conquest, you can't do the character's original fatality, you have to make up your own wich is a little hard, they should have had all the backgrounds from the old games to the new one, they should have also had a code to unlock some traps instead of killing the opponent to the same traps, and they should also let us unlock the old arcade games (Mortal kombat 1 through 4) instead of having the old games on the kollector's edition."
3,Great Fighting Experience,This game is a great conclusion to the Deadly Alliance Trilogy. It has fun mini-games and a roster of fighters that will amaze you. The Konquest mode has improved from its begining in Deadly Alliance and morph to something more comparable to Shaolin Monks. The only fall back that I can see is the Kreate-a-Fatality is not impressive for what it was meant to be and that the lack of real endings kinda doesnt make you want to complete the game with all of the characters.
1,Do not buy!!!,This game is not compatiable with Xbox 360...do not buy unless you stillown your old Xbox!!!
4,:0),"i like it,and i'm glad i got it because they gave it a low rating and i think it should get higher. I enjoy the konquest a little better this time, the fact that they brought out all the players scored extra points with me and the mini games was good for me enjoyable a keeper"
4,Nice instrumental selections,"This CD contains 10 tracks of music with no singing. Well known conductors. Skitch Henderson, Andre Kostalanetz, Eugene Ormandy, Leonard Bernstein and others. The music is more on the classical side than rock or pop. Sleigh Ride and The Skaters Waltz open this selection very well. There's a couple of selections from ""the Nutcracker"" as well. Overall, a very nice CD with soothing holiday music."
1,Hulless?,"Although I like white popcorn this seemed to be sub par with other brands I have tried.it is also described as hulless and I do understand that no popcorn can be truely hulless, but this had more hulls tjan the pop secret I have been using. I won't be buying this brand again. Not to mention the botched job shipping this product not a happy camper."
1,NOT WHAT I REQUESTED AND I HATE IT,I requested hulless popcorn and I got popcorn with hulls. I have 6lbs. of yellow corn which I cannot use. I wanted the popcorn for my grandson who gets choked on the hulls. Need I say more. I guess I will have to find a farm and feed it to the chickens.
3,does the job,"This is an ok board. The tile in the middle looks like it wasn't put together with much care. The edge is rough on some sides and smooth on others and I have the urge to push the tile into the board further, but that's just the way it's made. I was hoping for a slightly larger board. It's pretty easy to clean and the blade seems durable. I think I was hoping for something more chic, but this is ok."
1,Who is that second reader trying to kid?,"It's great to be reminded about all these early sentimental novels, but that's about it. So maybe the best thing about Stern's book is the bibliography. It sure isn't the prose or the insights. I was SO disappointed by this book."
4,Comments on the Missing Anthropoid,I have read this book and found it to be interesting and it identifies and dispells some myths about life in Iraq. The organization of the book leaves you wondering what is going to happen next. The titles of the chapters are are interesting and gives you a desire to read them. At the end of the book it leaves you wanting more.
5,Great Addition to Universal Remote,"I purchased this item to go with my URC-300 and to control components in two different compartments in my entertainment center. The Expander works as advertised. I have video components in one compartment , which is where the Expander is located. The second compartment contains audio components and required the use of the flasher modules (6 included), which work great. I can now control any component from any room in the house. Very happy with the results.One note is that the Product Dimensions listed at Amazon are for the box and not the Expander it self. The unit is much smaller."
5,A great addition to my URC 200,"I purchased this unit separately about a year ago after having already used the URC 200 without a base station for close to a year. When I decided to go from an open component rack to a cabinet (with a vented metal door - Studiotech Ultra U-48) I had trouble using the remote; this unit solved that problem nicely. Set up was also very simple. I didn't have to connect the RF buds (to each component) that were provided by the manufacturer. It worked great right out of the box. Now I can control my home theater components without having to point the remote at the cabinet. And, I can even control them from another room. I found that to be very cool."
5,great for a loft room,"We have a loft where our grandchildren stay and my mother when she is in town. We have this unit set up so we can control the sound, pause a dvd, turn off the unit and complete other functions without running up and down the steps or getting off the couch. We pause it a lot so we can communicate with them. We have another one on the basement floor so we can control the tivo and DVR without running upstairs to the console"
3,MRF-100,I am unable to review this piece of hardware because I had no use for it. In my home theater my room is about 20x20 and the remote is sufficiently adept in controlling all my equipment without needing the RF extender. I will try to sell it as it is still unopened. As it was a package deal from amazon I thought it was a great deal. Typical of buying things you don't need.
4,Great Series,I love the Regency Pirate's series. They always seem to do the unexpected. Characters are easy to feel as though you know them.
4,Beginning a little rough but the rest was great!,"I had some misgivings about liking this book because the beginning seemed a little juvenile and unbelievable. But as I got into the book, it became a complicated plot that was, I felt, well written and full of great characters. The love scenes were good (a must for a romance in my opinion) and the heroine was adorable! I loved that the plot kept getting more intricate. How do these authors think of the angles? It boggles my mind! Good job Jennifer. I just purchased the other two books in the series because I have to know what happens to the tortured Captain Ardmore."
5,"""May I?"" Yes you may!","Anyone who has read this hot hot book couldn't help but remember this question Grayson asks of Alexandra. A well told story of an unlikely couple who disregard society's strict conventions and find love, passion and friendship together. A real page turner that I thoroughly enjoyed."
3,Predictable and typical of the genre,I read the first 2 in this series and that was enough. It got pretty boring by the end of the 2nd book.
4,Definitely Enjoyable,"I saw a recommendation for this book at ""Smart Bitches, Trashy Books"" (an interesting website) and figured I would give it a try since I had never read a romance with a pirate in it. I enjoyed the book and read it quickly. If you delve too deeply into the characters and actions, you can question why the heroine would ever want to be with the hero and some of their behavior. But, that is not the reason why you reach a book like this. You read a book like this to escape and have fun. And, this book delivered."
5,Great Story!!,"I read this book when it first came out in paperback. I just recently re-read it on Kindle. It's just as good & a page turner the 2nd time around as it was when I first read it brand new.I strongly recommend this book & the ""Pirates"" series."
5,wonderful!!,"I was utterly charmed by this book. Everything worked for me - the writing style, the chemistry between hero and heroine. Altogether a wonderfully enjoyable read, which, I must admit, I started in the evening and finished early morning... I just could not bring myself to put the book down!"
3,The plot was a great idea - writing not so great,The plot and the ideas in this book were great - but the writing just lacked something. I know this is a newer author - so that may be the reason but - it just lacked something that would have pushed it into a 4 or 5 star rating. There were some basic mistakes that annoyed me and the writing seemed rather simple. Since I found the plot interesting I did not just put the book aside after reaching page 79 and being thoroughly annoyed (didn't like the female character) - I trudged through skipping over sections to see how it would end. I may pick up her next book if it is about the bad pirate (who I liked better than Finley - who just seemed like a wimp). She has potential - so I won't give up on her writing completely yet.
3,Not A Keeper - But Still A Good Read,"""The Pirate Next Door"" was a fairly enjoyable read. I do not see myself adding it to my list of ""keepers"" but I would recommend it to others looking for a fun story.One gripe that I had was the many characters that ran back and forth in this story - I found myself flipping through the pages trying to keep up with who was who. Once I got a fairly good idea of who was after who and who sided with who and why this person had a gripe with that person...the story proved to be rather amusing.I would very much like to read the story involving Captain James Ardmore. In fact, he was my favorite character in the whole book and seemed to be (in my opinion) more pirate than pirate hunter.All in all, an enjoyable read with MANY interesting characters. *grin"
2,Could have been better,I read Jennifer's Mad lord Mckenzie I could not put the book down. I felt like this book was written by someone else. I did not feel the connection between main characters.
2,Did not feel this story at all,"Sorry I did not like this storyline at all. There were so many things that made it annoying.I don't wish to be negative on this story but a woman searching for her 2nd husband would not risk her reputation to save a new neighbour.After being compromised by entering a bachelors home, she carries on her normal life with no ill effects. Im sorry very hard to believe."
3,Good information,I read the book but didn't get to do much hiking while I was in Hawaii because of the time restraints. I'll be sure to use it next year when I go again.
5,I'm In Heaven!,"Wow, these are amazing! Although the listing shows it as various artists, it's actually played by pianist Carl Doy. He plays so wonderfully beautiful! THE best piano music on the planet, period. I'm always ecstatic to find his music, especially since he's not readily available. These cds were well worth the wait. The arrangements are perfect, from the first track on disc 1 to the last track on disc 4. Tonight is quite different from other arrangements, yet it's still true to the song. Sealed With A Kiss is played to perfection, with lush strings, light percussion and great piano playing. Same with Killing Me Softly, it's tear jerking beauty. All of the tunes are. He really knows how to get beauty out of a piece. Out of all the many pianists out there, he stands out; in a class all his own. Very romantic but also relaxing. Put these cds on and suddenly all the badness in the world seems to go away. Wonderful!Thank you Amazon for having his music!!!!!"
3,MURDER MYSTERY!!!!!,"The print for this film was probably better than it looked, but Alpha's transfer made it look worse. Otherwise, it's a pretty good murder mystery."
4,CA$H from Square Foot Gardening,"The revised edition of his first book, ""Square Foot Gardening"" is a much better source of information on how to use his system to grow food. The reason I bought this book was that it was supposed to have much more information about growing food on a large scale. That was what I was interested in. But, if you are more interested in marketing your produce, there is some info here that would be better suited to that."
2,Square foot gardening,This book mainly deals with how to sell to restraunts. It has very little to do with the square foot gardening method.
1,Buyer beware!,"Thought I got a great deal on this unit for under $300 brand new at a local electronics-chain store. Setup the unit, everything seemed fine after a DVD test drive. I got the cable run and the TV quality was poor, but it was expected for this no frills system. Connected a set of headphones into the headphone jack and that was the end of it. No sound at all (either headphone or built-in speakers). The remote is also terrible...no range and you must be directly in front of the unit for it to respond. Audiovox support is of no help."
4,Fine product,"After 6 months of using this product I still enjoy the look of it and the quality of image, as well as the possibility of watching dvd, vcd, cable and antenna tv, and even listening to cds on it. It's true that the sound quality and volume are not great, but for a bedroom or kitchen tv the product does just fine. The remote isn't bad at all, lots of functions, settings angles, zoom, etc, all is there, in a card like format, light and it even comes with colors to help identify functions. I have played many dvd formats, including computer burnt stuff, most of them work here, which is a plus for this unit. Overall I'm happy with the product."
5,The Cuban Cowboy of our Buddy Holly dreams,"This is the album that brings them all together -- city, country, Anglo, Cuban, rock, rumba, Buddy Holly, and the Sons of the Pioneers -- and forces them to work out their differences. It went directly to the top of my playlist."
5,Ned Sublette!,This album is awesome. Like everyone else is saying it just keeps you coming back for more! I will say that i listened to it a little bit about four months ago and it didn't do too much for me...but then for some reason i came back and it hit me! I can't turn it off!
1,Not buy again,"I made the mistake of buying a bunch of this stuff for working on various electronics and computer projects. The bittering agent got all over my hands face and my pizza ruining my dinner and making working on anything the rest of the evening a problem. The agent gets on the keyboard, hands, etc. and if you are not careful all over you. I respect 3M's efforts to prevent abuse but I will NOT buy this stuff any more."
1,bitter experience but I found a use for it!,"Wow... this product sucks!!!! For weeks on end you can type on your keyboard and still ruin your sandwich!!! Happily, I've found it works as a squirrel deterrent... they don't chew holes where I spray it, so that's nice. (the propane hose to the grill is constantly under attack) If they had just marketed it as squirrel repellent they would have gotten positive reviews from everyone."
1,to much,i hope theres more then one can being sold of this.if it is only one can id rather buy it at my locale freds store it only costs a little bit over $6.00 a can there i can get about 6 cans there for the price this person is trying to sell at. i cant believe amazon is letting it happen its a scam if it only for one can of the stuff
4,Espléndido,"Me ha causado una grata sorpresa tropezarme con esta cantante que no conocía. Concha Buika, con su trabajo, redescubre ese gusto por la nueva forma de expresar el flamenco, el jazz, el funk y desde luego, sin dejar de lado sus raíces africanas. Esta cantante, cuya vida de artista no ha sido sencilla - por lo que he leído - refleja el sincretismo de las nuevas generaciones, con claras influencias de géneros tan disímiles, pero con un mismo norte por la buena música. Ahí radica su encanto. No es sólo un producto de España, Buika es la misma expresión de lo actual y universal. Se lo recomiendo a quien desea escapar de lo común y escuchar nuevas cosas."
3,She keeps getting better.....,"No doubt she has a great talent! There are a few missteps on here, and some fine songs as well. But I am writing this just to point out that, for my money, her 2007, 2008, and 2009 release are all steps forward, so if you are new to her, consider starting with those. The retrospective En mi piel is excellent, but for a single disk I'd take the El ultimo trago where she pairs wit the great Chucho Valdez. Don't miss it!"
1,Buy this at your own risk!,"This is one of the worst recordings I have ever heard. The lyrics sound as if they are straight out of the encyclopedia, without a shred of artfulness. The musical settings of the lyrics are awkward and there is very little here to hold my attention. I want my money back!"
4,The Steelers Reader,"I must preface this review by saying that I am not a Steelers fan or even a football fan. Never the less I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was given to me by a Pittsburgh based friend who thought I would appreciate the writing and ( as a Cubs fan ) the 'lovable losers' quality of the early Steelers. My friend was right.This is indeed a terrific underdog story. With a founder/owner straight out of Damon Runyon and a record of only eight winning seasons between 1933 and 1971 this team was the doormat of the NFL. Then with Franco Harris's Immaculate Reception in 1972 everything turned around. The Steelers became the dominant pro football team for the rest of the '70s with eight future Hall of Famers and nine visits to the playoffs.The writers assembled to tell this compelling story are first rate. This book is required reading for Steelers fans, but I would recommend this book to all football fans or fans of good writing."
2,Disappointed,"I have listened to Ricardo for years, mostly live in San Francisco. This album fails to capture his tremedous piano work but instead sounds more like trying to mimic that ""smooth jazz"" radio sound. His keyboard touch is way too dramatic often overtly pounding the keys into submission. His ""piano leads"" are not well thought out and rather boring; his bass lines are too muddled; and the overall album takes you nowhere. David Benoit he is not; usually selecting or writing instrumentals that are uninspired. He could use a melody writer to lock him in to something more recognizable to the listener next time around. I will continue to purchase his future releases in hopes that they are better than this work. Sorry. Two stars..."
3,It's ok,"The only reason I picked up this book is for my book club. It was a very light quick read, and enjoyable. No substance whatsoever, but a good way to spend a lazy Sunday. Reminded me of the era of Agatha Christie, with some very real people in very fictitious environments."
3,Mediocre performance and design,"Sound quality is actually pretty good, but design, build quality and ease of use just fair. Buttons feel cheap and flimsy and the lack of auto reverse makes it a bit of a pain to use. Battery life however seems quite good."
1,dissapointment,I'm really disapointed in this walkman. I read all the positive reviews so I decided to buy it but I disagree with them. The sound quality is horrible there's a noise even at the lowest volume level. Really cheep product.
1,Not worthy of Harvard ties!,"This book is an incredibly lame, inane story about the ludicrous adventures of Harvard freshmen committing and solving murders. Remember Nancy Drew? This book (and its sequel, Death of a Radcliffe Roommate) are like vulgar parodies of Nancy Drew mysteries. Only this time it's high SAT-score Nancy Drew with no morals or values, trapped in the early eighties. Harvard students might enjoy reading it for the laughs (the students complain about the yearly tuition cost of $10,000) but others who read it will simply be glad they didn't go to Harvard."
3,Not impressed,There is some good info. here but it's missing allot too. There is no parts break down. Schematics are too small. Pretty basic.
4,Left out?,"Well I'm from northern Ohio and I primarily bought the book to learn my machines.I have two Gti's and they were 4years old when I bought them. The previous owner took the proper care of them strictly by there looks and performance when I tested them on the the water........ Well since the winters are sometimes very cold,I assumed that there was a very important process to winterize these skies . I also was told that I was to make sure I properly worked antifreeze into the unit to prevent and damage,But in this maual antifreeze is not even mentioned in this winterizing procedure. Well what's up with that........is it unnecessary,or for some reason ,was it omited...........? thank you"
1,Finding the Real Me,"Watch out people! I ordered the book. When it arrived it ""appeared"" to be what I ordered. Instead, it had the correct cover enclosing a different book. I sent it back and asked for a replacement. Again, I got a different book with the correct cover. I was advised by an Amazon support person to send it back and get it somewhere else. I did send it back. I have not read it and can give no opinion on the book. Just the service.This rating system forces you to click on at least one star. I did, with no knowledge of the book."
5,Rippingtons CD,"The first CD by Russ Freeman/Rippingtons - FANTASTIC - I've wanted this for my CD collection for several years, and now I have it. Great Listening."
2,Almost useless,"Unlike the flash drive that I've been using for a few years, this one draws too much power to work on the keyboard port of my Mac. It is very inconvenient to reach around and plug it into a port in the back of the CPU, especially as I don't have any ports free back there. So this 'upgrade' was for me a big step backward.As if that weren't enough, the disk mounts as two separate volumes, one of which is completely useless. Has something to do with the optional security system, but only for Windoze users."
1,Hoppers are not so happening anymore,"Too much showing off and not enough spirit like they use to sing with. I like them but only to listen to, I can not watch them on stage. It is so aggravating the way they stage their routines. Kim is quite the show-off. The gal can sing but good grief, lose a little of yourself and portray more of God."
1,Waste of money,This was the biggest waste of money I've ever seen on amazon. There is nothing in the doc that you couldn't get within 1 minute on Google. It's an 898 word Wikipedia entry and and terrible one at that. Do not waste your money.
2,Needs better shipping packaging.,"There really wasn't any packaging when it was delivered today, unless you call throwing the hitch ball mount into a box packaging?When I opened the box the hitch ball mount looked used, that's because the paint was all beat up.....I should have sent it back but I needed it now so I just repainted it and called it good."
4,head ache inducing,"Crazy. Featuring the most insane animation you've ever seen with a wonderful soundtrack (that comes with the DVD) of some of the best noise punk from the likes of Lightning Bolt, Wives, and the legendary Pink & Brown. It gets better and better as you go through it (with the exception of one set which wasn't as good as the previous but still damn good) and climaxes with the biggest mind f*** you've never experienced. If you liked the animation of Paper Rad on The Power Of Salad then you need this. So, if you're looking for a good time and don't mind a pounding head ache, buy this now.P.S. For extra painful goodness, watch with the lights off!!"
4,take a break from polished and perfected experiences,"I picked this up knowing nothing about Load Records. I had previewed one of the tracks and figured that anything sounding that crazy probably looked pretty crazy too. I was right. The music and the videos on this compilation range from insane to just cracked, anarchistically messy to just lazy, and trippy to more mundanely odd. The quality can be uneven, yeah, but there is more enthusiasm than money in this and that makes it all feel good anyway. There is a good range of styles that will expand what you associate with noise music, from dog-mounted cameras to paranoic synchronized cartoons. The last video is one of the trippiest pieces of op-art I've ever seen. If there is a flaw it is that some videos are better than others, and a bad video will make a song seem less interesting, but the audio cd (with the same tracks) makes up for that. If you were actually looking for this, go for it, you'll find something to enjoy."
2,mildly entertaining,"I am a fan of Rosemary Clooney's work but this cd was disappointing. The song selection looked promising but the execution was flat. We stopped enjoying after a few minutes, turned our attention elswhere halfway through and were a little irritated by the end. It was not up to the usually high standards of her other works."
4,Rosemary Clooney - Christmas songs,"A very welcome Christmas album which truly complements her earlier recordings of festive material. Miss Clooney managed to retain great warmth in her later recordings and live performances. It is a moving CD with some beautiful phrasing and is a definite ""must"" for serious christmas listners. A lovely album"
5,She sold me!,"Wow, what a singer! I agree she doesn't sound like she did in her prime, but even after a tough life, she is still great. Love this CD and all the songs. Wish I was born 20 years earlier to enjoy her when she was still around."
3,I wish it was finer,"Hey pplVery recently i bought this 66801. Generally speaking I like this watch but I just wish it was designed a little more finer. The strap doesn't really go with the big dial. The 2 buttons at the bottom of the dial are really not worth being there. If only timex had improved its final touches with this watch, I could have given it a 5. Other than that, its nice. The FLIX thing works cool and so does all other functions.=====By the way, after 6 months, its strap just broke. That's not good."
1,Worst Watch,Its of bad quality. It stopped working within few weeks. its not worth for 40$. you can buy it for few dollars in garage sale.
1,Where's the bass?,"I really, really wanted to like this box set but the lack of bass in the remastering just leaves me cold. I have old Hendrix albums (yes, LPs) and the sound is so much better than what is offered on this box set. Even when I hear these songs played on the radio, there is more bass. Of course, the performances are worthy of a listen."
2,Don't Egg Them On!,DON'T FALL FOR THIS ONE - there is at most one previously unreleased cut on this CD. They must think that Hendrix fans are not very bright. Please send a message to the recording industry that this mockery is not acceptable - DON'T BUY IT!!!
3,Jimi is a genuis but.....,"His family is looking to make a fortune from reselling and reselling the same music. If you have Jimi's first three albums you have all the music on Disc 1, if you purchased the Box set that came out last year you have most of the music on Disc 2, there are only about 2 or 3 new songs or different versions on this set and for $20+ its really not worth it. If they are going to put out new Hendrix music make sure it's nt available on some other CD. I love Hendrix and his music he IS the greatest musician, artist, guitarist of all time but I bet money he would not be happy with the way his so called step sister and extended family(not his father but cousins) are out here trying to resell his music to keep their pockets phat, he's probably rolling over in his grave. Jimi never cared about money just music it seems to be the other way around for his so called family."
3,Same old greatest hits,"When will they get off the dime and make a true Jimi Hendrix Anthology?98% of these songs can be found on any other Jimi Hendrix Greatest Hits type cd collection.Look,a true Jimi cd collection would include choice cuts from Electric Ladyland,such as Rainy Day,Dream Away,And The Gods Made Love,House Burning Down,cuts from Jimi Hendrix Blues{which Here My Train A-Coming done solo on 12 sting guitar was really first issued on the soundtrack to the film ""Jimi""}.Will it take a 3 cd set to get it all,you bet,but this guy deserves a 3 cd set,and not just a box set of alternate takes and what not.This guy was and is still the rock guitar God that those in the know see him as.Lets show some respect,once and for all!"
5,The Best of Jimi,Thie 2 disc set contains all of Jimi's best songs and even the live disc stays true to the original song. It's Jimi at his best.
3,May be better to some than others,"This is actually a great set of songs by Jimi, both the Studio and Live albums. I found the songs themselves to be great, but was rather annoyed at the pacage itself. Many of the songs listed as previously unavailable/unreleased were previously released, primarily on the box set from just a year before.This will be a great album for anyone who like Jimi but can't afford the bigger set, or people getting started on their Hendrix collection, but for those of us who own the larger set, buy it only if you already know that only a few songs are truly rarities..."
2,Not what I was expecting,"I bought this book because the title really caught my attention. I love Taoism and would be very interested in reading more about Native American spirituality. I have been drawn to nature recently and have started focusing on the spirituality of nature, seeing how everything is connected and the Universe is a living universe. But....this book wasn't as interesting as it's title. It seemed to be more of a journal and less of a spiritual study."
3,It's ok,"This book is ok to me, it just seem not exciting to read, nor was it easying for me to read and follow since I do not have such high education to make sense of it. The author talks too much of his conflict with his yards and how do deal with it, and uses philosophy to help guide him, yet goes on and on, which I did not get far in reading the book because it was off subject a lot. I do understand what he was trying to teach, but it was not for me. I more get to the point and meditating on philosophy. The author could of just used envirnmental science and physics to solved his problem, than use philosophy a lone. He would been better of digging up his front yard to force the ants to leave, then re-seeded the lawn. And is physics to solve his back yard issue. But others may find this book good to read? It was just not for me."
3,order was a little short,"Was suppose to receive 4 lbs of steamers per product discription, but only received 2 lbs. Tried calling their number and got an answering machine; still waiting fora call back."
4,A good solid Tactics book!,"This is a good solid tactics book with a pretty good selection of tactic types, and a focus on intermediate level tactics.If you're looking for extensive description of the tactics your probably in the wrong place, and I can also see this not meeting the needs for both beginning chess players and advanced ones. But its kind of hard not to be enchanted with this book.limitations include; quite alot of prompting of the solution with a vague organization of similar motifs and a focus on rather forceful tactics.In short this is just the kind of tactics book to go over and over until you are able to solve most of the problems in short amount of time (and quickly recognize the pattern). This has been my goal, I know this isn't the ONLY puzzle book on tactics, but it IS a good first one, and a figure I can graduate to something that offers more complexity and less hints."
5,An absolutely fantastic book about tactics,"This book will be an evergreen. It has all the tactical motifs, including rare ones such as patter recognition and defensive tactics. The examples are excellent. They're not too easy or too difficult. Ms. Polgar has become one of the best chess authors in the world. I strongly recommend this book to beginners to intermediate people and even some advanced players. Well done!"
3,"Not ""Tactics for Champions""","This is an extremely elementary book of basic tactics. A book I might have read at age 12 when I first learned to move the pieces. I acquired ""Chess Tactics for Kids"" by Murray Chandler at the same time for my 5 yr old grand-nephew(too advanced for him); it is more advanced than GM Polgar's book for ""Champions"". I am not a rated player, have played perhaps 30 over-the-board games in my life. I haven't played, except sketchily, in 30 yrs. Whether or not the positions are from Champion games is irrelevant. Champions(and there are millions of their games) make terrible over-the-board mistakes. This is a book for beginners. I regret I bought it, and can only put it up for my grand-nephew....I think he'll be ready for the ""Champions"" book within the year, after all, he's five and just learned the moves(if he was, say 8, with more mature learning skills and patience, he'd be ready now). 3 stars because it is a good chess book, just, deceptively labeled and marketed."
5,An Excellent book of its kind,"This book is perfect, with lots of excercises and lots of important tactics discussed and overviewed. An exceptional piece of work!!!"
3,Chess Tactics for Champions,Good book armors you with different weopons in the mid and end game to give you edge over your opponent.Shahzeb Mistry
4,Pretty Book,"This is one of the more ""attractive"" chess books I've ever seen. The information in this book is pretty good. Nothing groundbreaking..(Pins, Zugs, Draws, Skewers, etc.) Thus, you can find the same themes in other books. But, the major plus about this book is that it is simply ""pleasing to the eyes!"" Very easy to read. The words and illustrations are cute. That is a bonus, because you can get tired of studying these type of books..."
5,Best book on tactics for intermediate players,Another fantastic tactical book. Ms. Polgar has done a fantastic job putting examples in easy to understand sequence. There are many different unique types of tactics here. I learned a lot from it. This has to be the best instructional book on tactics for intermediate players. This is the continuation to World Champion's Guide to Chess. I can't wait for the next volume.
5,Great starters tactical book,I have well over 100+ chess books and this book is one of my favorites. Easy to understand. A great book for advance beginners. Good warmup book before tournaments as well. A have to have book IMO
4,Improve your chess game,Susan Polgar's book is bound to improve yur game and you'll have fun working your way through it.
1,Decent Technician But Otis Elevator Regrettable CD,"There is a craftiness out there killing the potential for good storylines and engaging character development in film; here we see its parallel in recording; so much lulling of a techno smaltz,so little room for expressive energy to emerge anywhere remotely human--yanni and john tesh would probably disagree"
5,HILARIOUS!,"Alternative Champs are the rare breed: a rock band that is both funny and listenable. The songs are musically great, and even though the genre bounds are often quite plain, it is for the ake of parody. And it's also a testament to the bands ability that they are able to bounce seamlessly between r&b; and hard rock on the same album. Lyrically the record is hilarious and clever, but never at the expense of a good song.Seriosuly good stuff here."
3,Too soft too feel,"The bristles were to soft for my thick hair. I barely felt it. When I first got a scalp massager years ago from my doctor, it had harder bristles, so it was more effective. This one is just ok."
5,Excellent Book,I recently purchased Paul's book after stumbling in the career goals essay post my HBS application. Chapter 2 on developing the career goals essay has helped tremendously in organizing the material from my HBS apps and developing an efficient structure to answering the five discrete parts of Wharton's essay 1.It's 12:30 right now but I wanted to share this with everyone.

5,Excellent resource for anyone applying to a graduate program!,I used Paul's book to prepare for the interview for a graduate program in healthcare administration and I aced it! It's an invaluable resource not only for providing a context for your essays but also for developing the proper mindset to go through the application process. Everyone can benefit from this great book!:)
5,Very helpful with the applications process!,"This book was very thorough and really helped me with my MBA essays. I was nervous that it would just be repeating things I had read online, but it didn't."
2,Super long essays that obviously didn't meet word requirements are not good examples!,"The book provides a decent set of guidelines for writing essays. However, the example essays are all extremely long. For example the second (Chinese applicant to Wharton ) essay is at least 1,500 words when the word limit is only 1,000. I'm not sure if you can actually use any of these examples because of this. Also the outlines, introduction, conclusion etc the author suggests will take up valuable space. Overall the book is useful second or third resource but definitely not a definitive source for MBA essay writing. I found the ""How to Get into.."" book to be much more useful for my purpose.What was most disappointing was that even for the longest essays the author comments never addressed the length of the essay!"
5,"Well written, valuable resource for assisting in the admissions process.","This book was very important during my graduate school admissions process. With excellent real-world examples and insightful writing on what it takes to get into some of the best business schools in the nation, I was very impressed. With help from this book, I was admitted to my first choice school!"
5,Great Book . Covers a Wide Range of B-school Essays.,"Great Career-Goals Essay Section.Does not have school specific data though.Can be very well complemented by 'Proven Strategies for Top Business schools 'Good comments on all the essays . The essays are much better than those in montauk -'which covers only super -great profiles'.Do Buy this book , and use it before you draft your first essay!."
3,Unrealistic essays,"Almost all of the essays are WAY over the word count & page limit required. What he's telling you to include can NOT be included in 500 words or even 1000 in some cases. For example, the sample letter of recommendation is 7 pages long. No one is going to write you a 7 page letter."
1,Very Helpful Book,"This book will help you a lot to write good essays when applying to MBA programs. The book goes thru how to write an outline, what's a good way to structure your eesay and how to edit and rewrite it. Paul also talks about how to handle unusual circumstances in your essay. Also, the book had sample essays of people who got into MBA programs so you can know what a good essay looks like.I found it very helpful."
5,awesome author!,"I love Jean Plaidy! Because I'm a fan of history and especially during the 1500-1600's Plaidy puts in plenty of facts and also her imagination to give the book some umph. I think Plaidy is better than Philippa Gregory. Well, the only book I've read from Gregory was called ""The other queen"", which is also about Queen Mary of scots. But its such a confusing book to read. I'm all for Jean Plaidy!"
3,History-lite,"The novels of Jean Plaidy, a fore-runner of Phillipa Gregory, are a good way to get a grip on historical events and characters, so long as one bears in mind that they are primarily fiction rather than accurate historical accounts.This is not to decry the research and care which goes into these factional narratives, nor the enjoyment they can give. Mary Queen of Scots was a tragic figure whose capacity for making wrong decisions and following her heart rather than her head are well-known and in this book we are given her happy early years in France, reluctant return to Scotland as Queen and marriage to the weak and vicious Lord Darnley and then to violent Lord Bothwell. It is a dramatic tale, well-told and with convincing dialogue but for a real insight into the reign Anotonia Fraser's famous biography of Mary Queen of Scots is more satisfying."
5,Buy it now!,Don't waste your time looking any further - this is the best digital recorder for the money hands down.
4,Ripflash is a fine product,"I use the Ripflash for recording portions of classes I attend. The recording function is very simple to use at low bit rates. It can record for many, many hours. It is also easy to use as a portable mp3 music player. Make sure you download the latest software from the Pogo website link -- otherwise you may have problems. The only other thing to watch for is the built-in microphone. It doesn't pick up loud sounds very well -- they come across on playback with annoying static. But normal single voices record well, as do far off sounds."
3,Pretty good,"I had no problems with software or setup, as did some other reviewers. I also find the sound quality and ease of use to be just fine, though not exceptional.The device's biggest weakness is it has no pause button. This is a serious downside if you get interrupted, or just want to take a break, when listening to or transcribing a lengthy voice recording. You'll have to restart and the beginning and fast-forward back to the point where you left off."
4,Good voice recorder,"I purchased the Ripflash as a voice recorder and it works. The internal microphone works well and can record soft voices. However, I could not get enough volume from my external microphone. If you use the internal microphone, it will pick up any movement of your hand on the recorder. Voice activation works reasonably well. Documentation is not good but the machine is not that complicated. If you want to erase a file, the manual tells you to choose ""Del"" from the menu, but does not explain that you must double-click the play button to delete the track."
3,Old But Classic,"It's a good place to look into one of the greatest trading minds of all-time. The techniques and strategies outlined here are good, but not great. Personally, I felt as if he was holding back a little. I didn't expect him to reveal his best stuff, but he just did the impossible (11,000%+ one year ROE) the year before it was published. The second volume is much better and there's no loss of continuity if you read the second one without this one. 4 stars for 1988, but only 3 by today's standards."
3,no meet,"i feel larry is giving a morsel here and a morsel there and not giving away the real meat! Disappointed.besides it a dated book, needs an upgradesatish paul"
1,Terrible,I have to say that this is the worst movie I have ever seen. Stay away from this one. The acting is almost laughable. You would almost think that this was a spoof and they were trying to be funny. The acting is like something you would see in a high school play. Avoid this one at all costs. It did not deserve the 1 start I gave it.
1,Could have been better,"But it wasn't. A little too poorly acted and offbeat to really be of any interest, even of a novelty type interest. I am sure you could find another bad movie to watch that would entertain you more than this one. ""D"" for effort."
1,Let's watch on as Lovecraft violently rolls over in his grave,"H.P. Lovecraft's stories have been adapted into films, probably, more often, if not as often, as Shakespeare's work. Both men are the cornerstones of their styles, and both men's work has been seriously raped by film makers since the 1920's, save for a few films.Artsy? hardly.Fartsy? you bet. this film is like when a friend rips a ripe, wet, fart that lingers in the air for about an hour and a half.I've heard the popular opinion on the film is that it's like a bad Marilyn Manson video, and from the whole, MAYBE, 40 minutes i watched, i totally concur."
1,Life-vampire movie,"This is easily the worst movie I've ever seen with the second being ""The Chateau"" (seriously, it's worse than that). I love HP Lovecraft, but this is total and utter crap. I'd give this movie negative stars if I could as I can never get back the time spent on it. I think the creator of this movie should find another hobby other than creating crappy movies to torture people with."
2,Beyond the Wall of Boredom,"I have been known to enjoy some less-than-loyal Lovecraft adaptations in the past. This one unfortunately was almost a complete waste of time. With it's annoying music video style editing, slow moving story, and some poor acting, I found this film to be flat out boring. The movie clocks in at all of 84 minutes but it feels twice as long when you're sitting there watching it. I agree with others here, if you want your Lovecraft fix go rent Stuart Gordon's 'Dagon' or check out the HPLHS's fun and campy silent film adaptation of 'The Call of Cthulhu'. Hopefully when Guillermo Del Toro gets around to making 'At the Mountains of Madness' it will usher in a new wave of interest and quality film-making to Lovecraft's work."
2,Beyond the Wall of Sleep: Tedious Home Movie that is Right on in several Points,"Beyond the Wall of Sleep: Tedious Home Movie that is Right on in several PointsThe Bad:- This is 20 minutes of Home Movie stretched to 80 minutes.- It splices ""Blair Witch"" and Gore FX ad nauseum as cine technique in a loop as filler.- Except for 2 scenes, the acting is City College or Community TV level through-out.- The dialog is pretentious and hectoring.The Good:- Unlike the ""Reanimator"" spung off series of films, this film is Lovecraft in tone and exposition.- The acting of Savini (gore-FX savant) and the lead are islands of convincing acting.- The scene where a local seriff confronts a vigilante group of mountain men is really worth seeing... it captures Lovecraft's racist horror of inbreeding of human stock and an elitist's paranoia of the ""lower classes"" as intinsically evil.- Its culmination is a Lovecraft vision. This at least is a ""Lovecraft Movie"""
1,Another ruined Lovercraft story,The movie industry tends to ruin HP Lovecraft stories as a rule.This DVD was no exception.This seemed less a movie and more an experiment in continuous shoppy film editing in the style of those old TOOL rock/metal music videosEjected after 30 minutes
1,Wow- this is the worst movie in existance.,If I could give it negative stars I would. It has no plot or point. It goes on way too long. Lovecraft is probably rolling in his grave over this one.
4,Our grandson liked it.,"I thought the story was somewhat lame, but our four year old grandson liked it. If he liked it, I'm happy with it."
5,BEST PreK-Grade2 book series EVER!!!,"It was love at first sight. After finding Mo Willems' ""Don't Let the Pigeon Ride the Bus,"" my son was hooked. He couldn't wait to read it by himself.The name Mo Willems doesn't ring a bell? He is a 6 time emmy award winner for his work as a scriptwriter and filmmaker at PBS' Sesame Street. And he head-wrote the first four seasons of Codename: Kids Next Door.""Don't Let the Pigeon Ride the Bus"" lovingly teaches children to laugh at themselves and to be good role models. I highly recommend purchasing the whole series. We can't wait for the next book!Update 7/8/12: My son still loves Mo Willems' Pigeon books after all these years."
1,Horribly boring,My five year old son and I read between 15-20 books per week. I think this is one of the most boring books I've read. It inspires no imagination or conversation. My mother thinks it is cute. My five year old was amused during the first read.
1,Don't Let the Reviews Fool You!,"This is the second-worst children's book I have ever read, and I've read hundreds of them. I made the terrible mistake of reading fabulous reviews and buying it based on them. I will never purchase a book again--ever--if I haven't actually picked it up and thumbed through it. I can't give it to the child I planned it for and, in fact, wouldn't even consider donating it to a library.I would refuse to give this book any stars at all--in fact, it owes the readers several hundred stars (not to mention refunds), except my review wouldn't be accepted without one."
5,Great kids' book,"This book is amazing. So few words, so few lines, yet it conveys a character brilliantly. Absolutely great for little ones and young readers."
5,Great Book,"My 2 year old really likes this book. We have actually purchased a few other pigeon books, but this is our favorite. The humor might be aimed at an older age group, but our 2 year old enjoys the funny voices we add to the story. This is a fun book to read outloud."
5,FUNNY FUNNY BOOK,"What a wonderful book. Simple drawings and a hysterical story line. My kids love the participation aspect of the book. They get to be a character in the book, by keeping watch on the bus.They laugh so hard that sometimes I have to stop reading so they can catch their breath. Definetly recommend this book highly."
4,Great experience,"This was a great purchase experience. No hidden costs, product came quickly and as described. Would buy from them again."
1,Thank goodness for libraries,"I didn't spend a whole lot of time researching this book, but when my son enjoyed Knuffle Bunny I thought I'd check out the authors other books. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. I'm going to second what Bea said. There is nothing to recommend - the artwork is just BLAH, the story is not funny, clever, witty, or creative. My almost 4 year old thought it was boring and when asked if he wanted to read either of these pigeon books he said NO. 'Nuff said."
3,I liked this book!,My name is Axel and I am 7 years old. My English teacher read this book to us in class and I thought that it was funny. My favorite part was when the pigeon was dreaming of being in the bus. I recommend this book for children 3 to 9 yearsold. I also like this book Mo Willems: The Pigeon Finds a Hot Dog. I hope you think the same as me.
5,My 5-year-old son thinks it is hilarious.,"Such a humorous book. You will never get tired of reading it to your kids. When we got to the page where the pigeon screams ""let me drive the bus"" my son James was laughing so hard, like I'd never seen before. We read this book a lot!!!I absolutely recommend this book."
2,Not for us...,My daughter (5) sat through this once. She has absolutely no interest in it. She didn't think it was funny at all (and she has a great sense of humor AND a love of books). It sits on the shelf. After all the reviews I had very high hopes and was disappointed.
5,What a fun book,"This is one of the books I really enjoy reading. My daughter has loved this book since she was 3 years old, and we still read it just for fun. She starts giggling uncontrollably while yelling ""NO!"" at the pigeon, and I have fun adopting the cajoling, begging tone. There's no question that my daughter gets the point of the book and sometimes I'll just say, ""You can't drive the bus!"" when she's begging for something about which I've already said ""no.""Great book, great message."
5,Fantastic!!,"This is, hands down, our children's favorite book. My husband and I do a voice for the pigeon that just cracks them up and they LOVE that they get to yell NO over and over again."
5,great for the kids to interact with me while i read,"excellent is all i can say. I have my kids interact and say ""no"" through out the story and they just love participating. It helps get them ready for participating in library story time too."
5,Funny & Fantastic!,"This book is laugh-out loud funny! Please do not be put off by the illustrations, which look like they came from the 1950's or 1960's. I reviewed some of the 1-star ratings and the illustrations took a hit. To be fair, even my son kept saying it was a goose, not a pigeon!Anyway, what a fun story on the basic level, about obeying a simple rule. On the mature level, I think it is a broader lesson about not giving in to peer pressure. My son had me read ""LET ME DRIVE THE BUS!!"" three more times after I read it. We laughed each time. I also loved when the pigeon said, ""I have dreams you know!"".It was a quick read, entertaining, and I'll be looking for Mo Willems other books about this pesky pigeon."
1,It's not a small book,"Okay I did not expect this to be a ginormous,gigantic,humangus,AND LARGE! This is for classroom , it's not a handheld book that I can read in bed with my son."
2,"OK, But Didn't Live Up to Expectations","This book is OK, but certainly wasn't as amazing as most reviewers seemed to think it was. Really too simplistic for anyone over 2 years old. My grandkids were not too entralled. Would not buy in this series again."
2,Better for older kids.,"This book simply didn't keep my 2.5 year old daughter's attention, and she LOVES books. I didn't like the writing personally, and it just seemed akward. Very strange for a kid's book. I'm still not sure why it's so popular!ETA - I wish I could change this to 3.5/4 stars. I still don't LOVE this book, but with an older child I get the concept more. It's a fun romp for the kids though. I have a pretty advanced reader but she still didn't really get into this book until around 3, if that helps anyone!"
2,Too weird for my kids,"My kids just didn't get this book. There is no plot and the story (if you can call it that) is just too strange to enjoy. You don't feel sympathetic toward the pigeon, who seems to be talking to himself in a kind of psychotic/obsessive-compulsive rant. The illustrations are fun but I can't recommend this book when there are so many other wonderful children's books to be discovered."
3,Eh,"People love this book, but I dunno, it's not my favorite. Little one is not smitten with it either."
1,Horrible Book for a 2 year old,"My Mother-in-Law got this book for my 2.5 year old son. We are avid children's book readers, but I had never heard of these books before. I saw it had a Caldecott Award, so figured it must be pretty good. I asked my son to go get it so we could read and he said ""no"". I tried again later and he reluctantly went and got it. As we were reading I could see why he didn;;t want to read it. There is no story to follow. Just a stupid pigeon acting out because he can't get what he wants. This book flew over the head of my 2 year old, and completely bored me. I don't understand why this book has such great reviews. I would not recommend it to anyone."
2,Poor pigeon - we didn't enjoy his sad story,"I've only read good reviews of this book, and was excited to buy it. Once we received it, I knew my 4 year old boy (who is admittedly a ""sensitive soul"") wouldn't like it. Throughout the book, he just felt sad for the bird who desparately wanted to drive this bus and who was repeatedly turned down, for no stated reason. I even switched the ending to indicate that the pigeon gets to drive the truck at the end so that my son wouldn't feel badly for him. Mostly, through story-reading time, my son would say ""Don't worry, pigeon, we'll let you drive Mommy's car"" etc.For an adult, the pigeon's comments were very funny as he tries to convince the people to let him drive, but I wouldn't recommend it for a preschooler."
1,BORING!,Sorry but this book stinks. It's boring. It's not clever or funny like some people have said. It's just boring. My kids haven't given it a second glance. I have no idea how this book won any award of any sort.
1,What a painful book,"We got this book as a gift... What can I say? Am I too old-fashioned? Colors are awful, illustrations are horrible, but most of all - text is painful! There is nothing for kids, not even a story, there is absolutely nothing that goes for this book! (Sorry author, but this is ONE ugly book for kids!) We ended up throwing the book in the garbage, because we didn't want any kid to be exposed to this"
5,Made the kids laugh,18 month old & 3 year old laughed and laughed at this book. They want it read to them every night.
4,Love Mo,"Great book for sight words...but it's also all about how you read it! Got this book for my grandson and also bought the pigeon stuffed toy that has Mo saying ""Let Me Drive the Bus"" yes I do love my daughter-in-law despite it all. lol!"
5,Great quotes!,"My 3-yr old son got this book recently and he's got it just about memorized... he loves how the pigeon tries to negotiate and just the other day, my son says to me ""PLLLEEAASEE!!???!!! I'll be your best friend! I'll give you five bucks."" just like the pigeon. We also have ""Don't let the Pigeon Stay up Late"" which is just as charming."
5,My Son's Favorite!!,"My 3 month old son LOVES this book. Whenever I read it to him, he just starts laughing and smiling. It's a really cute and simple book -- perfect."
3,"Cute, but not too exciting for my 2 year old","I thought this book was overrated. I'm not sure what makes an award winning kids book, but my 2 year old isn't too interested. Maybe when he gets older he will like it."
4,NIV Trimline Bible needs more online physical description,"I looked for a pocket NIV Bible for a number of months before ordering the NIV Trimline Bible. Until it showed up, I was not sure what I would be getting because the online photos were not entirely descriptive. I was not sure of the color. I was not sure whether it was the size that I was looking for.I actually never found the pocket NIV Bible that I reviewed in a bookstore last year while traveling, but the NIV Trimline Bible is larger and hence more legible. I have enjoyed this bible in the months since I ordered because of its portability and I keep it in my car to use in Sunday school and in small group meetings.The Bible I received was burgundy leather. It fits nicely in a suit coat pocket."
3,Trimline Bible,"This Bible was larger than we wanted. We could not find a small, compact Bible with a real leather cover. Returned this product"
5,compact and beautiful,"This is a really nice, compact Bible. You can't go wrong with NIV. Plus, the pages are etched in silver and it is leather-bound. The Bible I received is dark blue leather with silver etching. I was expecting a burgundy/gold one, but no matter- a Bible is a Bible :)"
4,"Compact, but still easy to read","The Bible arrived securely wrapped. While it isn't pocket sized, it's long but narrow dimensions allow it to fit easily in a briefcase or purse."
5,NIV,great compact companion. I've been very happy with it. I am able to carry it everywhere with me. It is slender and lightweight and fits perfectly in my bag. Thanks
3,The Human Body-uncovered,"This is a nice book for kids about the body but I was disappointed that they chose to not include the ""private parts"". Children need to know about them too! To cover them with clothes and not discuss them is a BIG omission."
2,Good book...but why so small??,"My grandson enjoyed this book I had sent to him, but his mother and I were disappointed that the book was so small. I expected it to be bigger so that small children could look at bigger pictures. Bigger overlays on bigger pages would have a much better impact on young minds."
5,A new way of thinking,"I had read Hypercompetiton recently and I realized changing our way of thinking about business is one of the biggest challenges of the end of the centuri. D'Avenis model is a breaktrough description about how the market realy works, and how the managers must become more agressive in order to survive to the atack of foreign new game players.The idea of the unsustainability of the advantages - the core idea of the book- directly destroys Porter's traditional, builded arround researches made inthe 50's.I strongly recomend this book to be readed by all the executives from a company that wants to become -or remain- a market leader. This is and all-new approach that can make the difference. It is maybe the most remarkable book the 90's has been produced.Read it"
2,Unreadable,"This book was once thought to be the new rival to Michael Porter's books. Porter talked about sustainable competitive advantage and D'Aveni countered that nothing is really sustainable. I don't have any problem with the gist of the argument, but the book is largely unreadable for another reason. It is an orgy of charts and tables and confusing terminology. The author doesn't really try to build on exiting work. He wants to reinvent everything. When the book was written in the mid-90s, management consultants' fancy charts and diagram were in their zenith. So the author tries to awe the reader and runs with it as far as possible. The result is largely unreadable. I would say four stars for actual content and one for style. The book is now 15 years old, so it is not worth more than two stars."
3,Biblia Plenitud tamano manual,This is a very good small sized Spanish Bible. The price is good and will be a blessing for those reading Spanish.
5,Brilliant insight,"I found this book to be an excellent study and introduction to McPherson's work. Mr. Wood's analysis seems to be spot-on to me, and he makes some numerous insightful observations. Indeed, this Liffey Series is very good."
1,judy white,the conditon of this book is less than what was stated in the write up on the info page listing
2,Decent High-School Bio of Taft,"This biography of Taft was written for advanced junior high or beginning high school students, but it's the best I've been able to find. It's a reasonable summary of Taft's extensive career in government, although the simple writing level does get old, and it brushes over a lot of the more advanced issues, like his controversy with Roosevelt and his philosophy and impact as a Chief Justice.The book has 214 pages and is fairly large print.As a children's book, it's probably quite good, but I evaluated it from an adult perspective.If you're interested in his chief justiceship only, the book to look at is by Alpheus Thomas Mason."
2,"Not the ""Best of"" this Great Bluesman","One of the paradoxes of the blues is that if you happen to have a voice like burlap, you get critical points of autheticity. If you are blessed with a golden vocal chords as Josh White clearly was, critics will classify you as a cabaret signer.White is anything but a musical lightweight. His music greatly influenced folk legends Pete Seeger and Bob Dylan. Contrary to its title, this amalgamation does not do justice to White. It leans heavily toward his more popular songs (which came later in his career) which are not necessarily his best from an artistic standpoint.There is a chronological set of White's work available. The first three of these to contain his best work. Any of these would rate four stars."
2,"This is an odd recording, not the best of Josh White.","Josh White was among the greatest bluesmen ever. He also recorded lots of repertoire from the ""crossover"" repertoire of the Folk Boom. That stuff is not necessarily so hot, and that is what is on this recording. For curious fans only."
4,Nice introduction to Josh White,"I agree with ""Island Reviewer"" that Josh White's later years of folk and blues stand out as his best. His early blues are OK but there are many better blues artists of that period. His later recordings have better fidelity and allow us to enjoy his wonderful voice. The first time I heard him was on a set of 78 RPM ""albums"". I was stunned by his version of ""Strange Fruit""."
1,don't waste your money,"We purchased this as we needed something so my little one would stop pressing the buttons on the TV. Our TV did have a cover but our little one broke it. So we purchased this and put it on the Tv and within an hour, it was off. Total waste of money."
5,Excellent Guitar Rendition of Popular Hits,Michael Chapdelaine created one of the finest collection of popular love songs offered in a box set. This wonderful CD set will give every listener the enjoyment of true relaxation. I can't wait to hear Michael's next Guitar Collection masterpiece.
5,"Della Reese, need I say more?","Legendary Della Reese, a definitive collection of some of her best known works is a remarkable, and affordable buy. From the seductive Whatever Lola Wants, to the beat of Come-On-A-My House this CD just can't be beat. It is a must have for all Reese lovers and makes an excellent cocktail party soundtrack. With a total of 50 songs this CD is the best buy!"
2,Disappointed...,I had high hopes for Luther's Christmas CD. Not great...I got weary of it after the second song.
4,A good book explaining the Jewish perspective,"Written from the Jewish perspective, Ms. Weiss-Rosmarin delineates the differences between Judaism and Christianity. While Christians will not be persuaded by her arguments, certainly they will understand why Jews are not persuaded by Christian viewpoints. She clearly lays out many issues, but I particularly liked how she shows that the Law could never be superseded by any later doctrine. I think this book should be mandatory reading for any fundamentalist Christian who seeks to convert Jews, so that he or she will see why it is a waste of time."
4,Smelly but effective,"We had a new pond put in, around 20,000 gallons, and withing three weeks it was solid green. We put two bottles in initially, then in about two weeks put in a third bottle. results were noticeable after three or four days of the initial application. A week after the final application, the pond was very clear. Unfortunately we then had a large issue with filamentous algae, but we will get barley hay bales in place early next year to take of this issue. Only downside is it does smell like your septic tank is overflowing. another small issue seems to be that the ""purple"" bacteria seems to settle and coat the outside of the bottle, I had to re-fill the bottle partially with pond water, and a small handful of gravel, cap and shake until the coating was rubbed off, then pour the purple contents back into the pond. I think the suspension of the helpful bacteria could be improved with a emulsion. But overall it does work well."
4,"More Defined, not quite as entertaining","I went in to this CD expecting a wide variation like their last CD ""Inertia"", as they are one of the hardest bands to place in a Genre, and also went in thinking ""Ugly"" was one of the best new songs I've heard in a while. They have found a definite sound, which I'm not sure will be a blessing or a curse, but it's definitely a good CD worth the money."
2,huh???,"I would've given this album 1 star, but I'm giving it 2 stars only because the lyrics are cool. Otherwise, every song sounds the same and it gets boring after a while.And whose idea was it to print the lyrics in a wave pattern???"
5,Quite Good,"Ok, first of all im 16, and 2nd of all wow. This CD id flippin awesome. All of the songs are good, they are all heavy but not too heavy, which is good, they all heve good lyriccs and good beats. I recomend this to anyone who likes music."
5,One of the best albums of 2004,"I saw these guys at a Velvet Revolver concert....they were opening act. They sounded amazing so i bought their CD inertia. I listened to if a few times but didnt think much of it. When i bought this CD it way past my expectations and i thought, this was the band i heard at the concert. A lot harder than inertia with good lyrics and catchy songs. Especially Slow Drain, Ugly, Baptise Me. Great CD and a must by for all rock fans."
3,Exies,"'Ugly' is by far (imo) the best song on the cd, and maybe even the best song The Exies have come out with. I used to think 'Without' was their best, but my opinion has changed. 'Baptize Me', 'Slow Drain' and 'What You Deserve' are also pretty good songs, but I find the other songs a little too...un-rockish for me. Anyways, I give it 3 out of 5 stars, and Ugly is pulling most of that weight."
1,Possibly the worst book that I ever read.,Title says it all ... it's just pornographic twaddle impersonating cool. Even makes Jay McInerney look good.
1,Poor quality !!!,"After changing all 5 engine mounts on my Civic I'm getting more vibrations than with the old, cracked, 14-year old OEM mounts. Seems like the Rear Left Upper is the worst one. Also some of the bolt holes are drilled in the wrong places (around 1/8 inch off). Just cheap Asian made parts. The price was good but I'll have to replace them again with the good staff. I will never purchase the Anchor brand again."
4,Advanced Microeconomic Theory - Jehle & Reny,This has been an excellent book as I have discovered in about a month of intensive use. I would like however to see greater support and interaction with other users on the Author's Plone. For example it would have been great to have PPT presentations of the chapters. It would also have been useful to have the author's solutions (not hints) for a few of the questions so that a beginnig user can gain confidence in his own solutions when compared to the authors'
3,Disappointed,"I am a Finance Ph.D. student and I bought this textbook for my Micro class, and I found that this book did a very poor job in explaining the Micro concepts to a student like me with solid math background but little micro one. The authors, for some reason, use a more than difficult language to explain even the simple things. I believe that great teacher is the one who can explain even the most complicated concepts in simple way. Obviously I do not put Jehle- Reny in this teacher category. If you want to get a simple yet meaningful concept explanation, check out Walter Nicholson's book. I highly recommend that book for the introduction to Micro.If you want to buy a Micro textbook, do not take these people's feedbacks instantly. Chances are WE ALL ARE DIFFERENT that we have different opinions, so compare the books and decide for yourself !Happy hunting !"
1,TERRIBLE binding eliminates any possible value,"I would review the contents of this book if I had had a chance to get to know them. Unfortunately, the binding on the book is so bad that the book cracked in two pieces within a month of my buying it. Consider me disappointed and annoyed. My only recourse is an expensive book rebinding service. It's a shame, since the content is supposed to be quite good."
3,Generally OK,"The book is generally ok, however there are too many pages falling off and are about to fall off..."
1,Dont buy this crap!!!,"Dont buy this...! It is EXTREMLY hard to follow, unless you have a math background. The notations are very confusing. It explains concepts mathematically and you are expected to come up with the logic on your own. In my Graduate level class of 20 studing advanced micro, EVERY SINGLE PERSON said they are clueless about what it says. The text is so highlevel to understand. I had to read the very first chapter FIVE times to understand what is says and then I realised that it was explaining something I already know from Intermediate Micro, that indiferrence curves are convex to the origin!So, I would recommend you buy this excellent book ""Microeconomic Analysis"" by Hal R. Varian or ""Microeconomic Theory"" by Andreu Mas-Colell, Michael D. Whinston, Jerry R. Green (which costs only a fraction of the cost of this junk...). So, dont waste your time and money of this ..."
5,Fantastic,"While the book is certainly aimed more at grad students, I've found it to be invaluable in my undergraduate studies. It delves deep into the analytical mathematics behind microeconomics, where Varian and Nicholson brush lightly across the surface.Good for both undergraduates and graduates. Familiarity with the structure of analytic mathematical arguments required. Not for the economically or mathematically faint-of-heart."
3,Buy if you need,Of course this is not a book for simply interest about the topic. I don't consider this text difficult to understand. There are many much hard to read advanced microeconomic texts. The language used in this book is alright for a master student. Wish they have the hard cover version.
1,Deceptive Packaging,"This DVD has the same name and cover art as a series of audio recordings issued by Time-Life some years ago. I thought this might be a video accompaniment to the audio series. Instead I got a dubious history of jazz presented by some guy with a heavy Catalonian accent (the thing was produced in Barcelona)that slowly works its way from the turn of the century to the '40's, no footage of the original musicians, but a lot of footage of a modern-day Spanish youth dance club that likes to jitterbug. Good for them, but not what I was looking for at all."
4,Satisfying New Age!,"Mehdi is a multi talented instrumentalist whose music releases has been given worldwide acclaim. His seventh release called ""Instrumental Heaven"" is just that, a bit of heaven. His music is soothing and relaxing. I enjoyed the tracks, ""Heaven"", and ""Sweet Memories"", which has a touch of flamenco guitar in the Ottmar Liebert tradition. As with most New Age, the music can get a bit redundant at times. But Mehdi gives the listener melodies that are refreshing throughout the CD. This was a satisfying listening experience. Recommended!"
1,Repetitive,"Absolutely the most boring, repetitive, uninspiring, simplistic anduseless bunch of music. Here one tune and you've pretty well heardthem all. Sounds like the same few chords and notes constanty repeatedad nauseum. Nice covers but don't be mislead. Save your money and shoparound as easier lots better."
2,Sub-par,"This was way overproduced and frankly felt very sterile. Someone clearly enjoys playing with all the toys in the studio, but in the end the music is kind of souless.So two stars for being well engineered but that is about it. There are far better choices in the new age genre."
4,Great Music !,"I recently bought this item in online, and when it arrived in the post I played it straight away and was amazed. I had listened to some of Mehdi's music on low quality MMJB radio, but in CD quality it was absolutely stunning. The beauty of heaven, the passion of rain and the grand melody of clouds of light which stays in your head for days, all combine to create a brilliant album. The only thing that I could say I didn't like was the cover art, but then again it's very hard to describe a transition to heaven with a picture."
5,An album that you'll always keep reaching for.,"Every one of Mehdi's CDs are truly beautiful. I just love his overall sound and Heaven is a true work of art. If you want to just try one then this is A great starter, otherwise if you can afford it, the gift set is the best value and believe me they are all remarkable!"
5,One Of His Best .,I really like where Mehdi has gone with his music on this CD. It's different but still very uniquely Mehdi. Instrumental Heaven has become one of my all time favorites from Mehdi!
5,Great!,"If you have read a book my L.M. Montgomery, you'll really like this book. The stories all go along with the idea of recieving a letter or note. I couldn't put the book down! If you have never read L.M. Montgomery's books read the Anne of Green Gables series first."
5,This Watch is rated a 10!,"What's not to love about this watch? It's very affordable and really cute too. And the best part is, it is a time teacher watch. My 5 year old son has learned to tell time from this watch the old fashioned way (no digital). Gotta love that. You have the Timex brand behind it too. Even if it gets lost or broken, you haven't spent a small fortune. I purchased a second one just in case.... Two thumbs up!"
3,a good tool. but should be bigger,"Good teaching tool. But ""Past"" the hour and "" To"" the hour minute division may be confusing for kids. Minute numbers too tiny. I will look for a huge wall clock to supplement. Great seller though."
4,Flaming,"""The Wilde Century"" positions Oscar Wilde as the archetypal queer of the 20th Century (although perhaps not too far beyond), and as such it's insightful and enormously entertaining. Those not familiar with gender studies will marvel as Sinfield neatly constructs a convincing paradigm of queer/homosexual history. If you'd like a readable introduction to the germ of queer theory I'd recommend this book."
5,Best of Film,"I love this film. When it arrived I watched both Part one and Part two, 3 hours each. I then watched it again and again, eighteen hours the first day I owned it. I never tire of this film. I show it to all my friends and in classes and each time I see it I find more in it. If you are interested in politics, Italy, psychology or sociology, coming of age films, the sixties, or just love good character studies, with depth, humor and compassion. Wonderful film."
3,"A lot of form, very little substance","Don't get the wrong idea. This book IS an entertaining read, but that is about it. There are many books in the ""Gurdjieff field"". Most are fairly shallow because they are ""about"" events and personalities of people involved in the ""work"". Other books are first hand accounts and though subjective too, reading of the difficulties that ""veterans"" encounter as well as the insights they experience can be useful to those seeking the same path. Only a handful of books are truly essential (as far as reading goes). This book belongs to the first category mentioned above. Full of many interesting stories and conjecture, this is not a book for those looking at gaining a deeper understanding of what is ultimately important. However, water does indeed seek it's own level and for those wanting a good fix of the superficial, this book is for you. I'd be careful about buying this book as a gift."
1,NOT CALIF. COMPLIANT,"BE CAREFUL THIS IS NOT CALIF. COMPLIANT!!!!! When I received this I made one mistake. I beleived the hand checked list, that all parts were there. BIG MISTAKE!! Apparently the people they have checking the list DON'T REALLY make sure the parts are there, they just check it off regardless!!!! Anyway after 45 minutes I was ready to hook up the LAST ""T"" for the vacuum lines and guess what......yep no part!!! So $6.00 and a trip to Kragen Auto and I was done. When I emailed airaid about this I have had NO RESPONSE!!! Guess they don't care anymore about customer service than they do makin sure ALL the parts are in the box............"
5,categories of medieval culture,"I am a medievalist and I firmly believe that this is the best introduction to medieval studies. It is very comprehensive, imaginative, creative and absolutely original. It is a fantastic book, the work of genius I consult over and over again. It has nothing in common with boring, dry scholarly books that we are taught to write in graduate school. It has an advantage to present a total view, synthetic rather than analytical. Gurevich is a different type of scholar, not a Western one, so one should be patient with him because his methods of thinking are so different from linear thinking of European academic writing. Open your mind, read Gurevich!"
5,Highly recommended,"I was not crazy about this author's last book, ""Project Kaisei,"" but I am really crazy about this one. The author puts in so much in this relatively short novel that I felt like I spent my last twenty years in the town of Mendiola. The story is dark and sad but the main character, Ronnie Kowalski, is delightful and yet so real. I think readers who are not pleased with unrealistic plots and characters in fictions nowadays will be happy to find that a book like this still exists. I recommend it highly."
5,Fascinating,"This was one of the most fascinating mysteries I have ever read. In fact, I'm tempted to call it a classic. The story is about a retired homicide cop in Texas investigating an unsolved case. What makes this novel so unusual is the way the story is structured. In the first half of the novel, the story is a confession of an old man who has lost his purpose in life. The second half is devoted to how he is going to regain that sense of purpose. The mystery itself is compelling enough, but it is this man's struggle with himself that makes this story so rich and interesting. What more can I say? Read it and judge it for yourself."
3,Common sense advice,"As a parent, I may have missed some of the subtleties in this book, but I thought it seemed like a long exposition of what is largely common sense advice. No problem with it really - it was a good way to get started thinking about some strategies - but somehow I expected more insight out of it."
4,Peg Dawson As A Teacher. . .,"I had the wonderful opportunity to have Peg as an instructor for an education class in college. Unlike some professors, who tend to use their own published works as a core text, Peg gave our class a great variety of literature from various sources. She is part of a VERY SMALL group of instructors who went out of the way to make our class environment interesting and very educational. Many of the methods that we read and talked about were practiced in our class and she managed our class in a true democratic fashion. She is a great teacher who shares her own struggles as a school psychologist and as a concerned parent!"
2,"Okay book, but...","It was an okay book as far as his usual illustrations and storiesbut if you don't want your kid learning that it's okay to live with someone you're dating before marriage, then you might not care for this book."
1,charged for item on Feb12...,"as of March 15, it still have not arrived and I've e-mailed the supplier 4 times, without one reply!"
3,To Difficult,I didn't care for this video because it was difficult to follow. If you are a beginner then this is not for you.
4,Good Workout,It is a good workout and the music is great! I love the songs. Makes working out much more fun! Can't wait to get the second one.
3,ok workout,"This workout video was ok. I like the fact that she has the routines to gospel music. One thing that I did not much care for was when Yolanda Adams was singing live (don't get me wrong, I just love Yolanda Adams). The problem was; I could not hear the instructions on how to follow along with the workout. They were drowned out by Yolanda's beautiful voice. So I had to watch that part several times to understand the steps. But overall it is a good workout video. Some parts were funny too, especially when Kirk Franklin came out."
5,sweating in the spirit,i got this for me and i love the exercise and i love the music. i can keep up and it is a truly great workout. i am loving it.
5,"Buy it, you will not be sorry!!!!",The gospel music is upbeat and gets you moving. Before you know it the workout is over. I totally recommend this workout!
5,Sweating in the Spirit Review,"This DVD has motivated me to shed the pounds that I was trying to shed. Needless to say, I am very pleased and plan to purchase the 2nd DVD."
2,It's OK.,I love the music and the aerobics are pretty good. But once I got use to the routine I didn't want to hear her explaining what to do over and over again. I just wanted to do the routine since I knew it. There is no part on the tape where I can just go through the routine with the music and no explanation. This is the reason why I am rating it 2 stars and also I am bored with it so it's sitting on the shelf.
2,Sweating in the Spirit,Not really the kind of exercise I was looking for. I guess I was looking for something with music more toned down.
1,SWEATING in the SPIRIT,"It was not what i expected. It lacked the true meaning of gospel music, and dancing to GOD's praise."
2,It's ok,This workout dvd is ok I guess. I really didn't like it. She's too chipper and it's kind of boring.
2,Exercise video review,"While not a bad video, it didn't provide what I was looking for. I want to hear faster, louder praise music so that it keeps me going on the exercises (which I hate). I don't need the pep talks from Donna - I need something to take my mind off what I'm doing. Also, I found that she went through the dance type steps so quickly that I had difficulty following her."
4,My mom loves it!,"I bought this for my mom last year, in 2005, and she loved it. She said the music was good and it got her moving. It isn't your typical cardio but it works."
2,disappointed,I have several excercise videos and this is the hardest to follow. My biggest problem with this one is the filming. The camera is frequently focused on Donna's upper torso rather than a whole body shot which makes the steps very hard to learn.
3,It was okay,I was not very impressed with this workout. I am not sure what I expected. My disappointment could have been a result of style/technique. I am a big Leslie Sansone fan/walker and this was more dance areobics to me. It just wasn't for me.
3,It's Ok,"My Mom gave me this dvd and while she loved it, I simply thought that it was ok, in fact after the first viewing and workout...it's sitting on the shelf untouched. Shhh Don't tell my Mom."
3,Not as good as I expected.,"I love Kirk Franklin and there was hardly any time with him on screen or his music.....oh well, it's for exercise not for worship."
1,a total bore,"this is totally a waste of time and money...Donna R is an annoying version of Densie Austin, her cutsie comments make me sick, i cannot stand her arrogant attitude....i did this workout twice and found it UNINSPIRING and totally boring."
2,Disappointed,"I was expecting a ""spiritual"" as well as good workout, but instead didn't get either. I couldn't hear the music and the workout wasn't very interesting - it was the same over and over. It is definitely not what I expected."
