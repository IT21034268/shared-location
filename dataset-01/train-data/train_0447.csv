3,Does Not Lay Flat Next to the Body,"This a good bag, except that it does not hang right. When hung from the left shoulder, the bottom of the bag lays against my body, but the rest of the bag opens out away from the body. The top leans out at least 6 inches away from my side. It is as if the bag were begging for a thief to steal something out of it. It does lay closer to the body when hung from the right shoulder. This design occurs both when used as a shoulder bag or cross-body.Part of this is due to the strap being too long. But the main fault appears to be the strap, which is attached to the top and side of the bag. The strap makes the bag impossible to hang right. The only way I can make this hang correctly is if I ignore the strap altogether, and just lift it by the top of the bag."
3,Not Good for Petite People,"I bought this bag about two weeks ago in preparation for my trip to the UK at the end of December based on the great user reviews. I tested it out on a day trip to Disneyland a few days back and had a terrible time with it. My back was killing me! I realized that this bag was not made for short people at all! I adjusted the straps as tight as they could go, but the bag still hung way too low. I am 5'2"" and it needs to be about 2 inches higher to fit perfectly and not cause any back pain. If you are taller this bag would be perfect. But if you are petite, I would recommend going to REI and testing out bags in person.I would have rated this two stars, but customer service was great and they are refunding my money."
3,A different type of messenger bag,"As with the other reviews, I found the strap re-adjusted constantly during wearing (I had to put stitches through the strap to keep it in place). Also, the bag had a tendency to slide around a bit, probably because of the fabric. It does have a lot of storage, which is great. Allow plenty of time for delivery (took longer than I expected, and much longer than the usual prompt Amazon delivery)."
2,Smaller than stated,"I had ordered the bag to fit my laptop with sleeve. The description states that the size of the bag is 20""x14"". The actual size is 12""x9"" which is not even close to the size that I require for my laptop."
5,Excellent Baggallini bagg,The standard shipment was a very rapid delivery and the product was in very good condition. This was an excellent purchase! I love my baggallini messenger bag.
5,Beyond pleased,"I recently became disabled and up until then I used to always have some sort of back pack or messenger bag on my person. Seeing as how those sort of bags would just be in the way while trying to operate a manually powered wheelchair, I started looking into chest pouches and sling bags. After several different bags, I finally came across this beauty. It fits perfectly when I wear the strap over my back with the bag on my chest... It stays in place even while wheeling around all day. It holds everything I need better than I had hoped. It is large enough to carry several books/journals and even a handicap plackard while being small enough to allow free movement. I am very pleased with this bag. I highly recommend it."
5,Great bag!,"I love my Baggallini messenger bag. Just ordered my second after one of the zippers wore out on the first one I purchsed (after 5+ years of daily use, the bag itself is still in good condition). This is an amazingly utilitarian bag made of very strong fabric with many sections and pockets to hold your essentials and more. And the cross-shoulder feature with the padded strap is so comfortable, you hardly know you have it on. I highly recommend this bag for hiking, shopping, going to the park, as a convenient grab-and-run diaper bag, or anytime you need to have your hands free."
5,"Great all around ""Man Bag.""","I was looking for something to hold my iPad, and other ""manly"" items on a ten day excursion to Portland and Seattle and this fits the bill to a tee. This bag rarely left my person, sometimes up to 12 hours. I found it natural to sling it over the left side of my neck, with the strap adjusted so that the bag was centered above my right hip. This allowed me to rotate the bag towards my stomach to look or pull things out, and rotate it towards my lower back to keep it out of the way when shooting images. As described, there are plenty of zippered pockets with two closing zippers, a location for glasses with a Velcro-ed flap, and an elastic net to hold a 17oz water bottle. The material and zippers are well made, with only a small gripe that it can take two hands to unzip the front pocket. It also appears to be waterproof, or at least can handle the steady rain that Seattle had to offer on our way out. This is a very flexible and well made ""Man Bag."""
2,hans awkwardly when worn crossbody,"Size, color are great. However., hangs very awkwardly when worn crossbody. Seems to be either in front or nearly behind me. I prefer it hang at my side. Tried different adjustments to strap but no help. Anyone out there with ideas? Have always loved Bagallini but not happy with this one."
4,Great bag!,"Very nice bag. The outer pocket does not match the picture. :( Not quite big enough for what I wanted though. I kept it but i really needed a bag to take on the plane with me....so tired of heavy back packs. I ended up with the Patagonia MiniMass. The Baggallini just wasn't big enough for all these items: ipad, full size Bose headphones, a paperback book, small toiletries bag, glasses case and odds and ends."
2,Baggallini Messenger Bagg,I wear shoulder bags on my left shoulder - this bag did not sit comfortably on the left. Personal preference...
3,Smaller then expected,The bag was much smaller the I thought it would be. It is definitely not the axe if a backpack.
2,"Cute, but not functional","I bought this bag for my daughter to take to school (1st grade). It is a cute bag, but the strap is bulky and much heavier than the rest of the bag. It is also much smaller than I expected. The largest compartment is not even big enough to fit her homework folder. The material is a slick material that would probably be stain resistant, but for anyone wanting to use this for work/school - DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. It won't work."
5,AWESOME bag for amusement parks or Disney World!,"I bought this bag to take along with me to Disney World, and it was PERFECT! Not only was it spacious enough to take my sweatshirt inside, plus my wallet and maps for the park, but it also stowed away perfectly on all the rides that had nets or baskets to put your belongings in. Disney features these little glove compartment-like places to stow your purses or merchandise bags in and the rest of the family that traveled with us couldn't shove their book bags into them for anything! My Baggallini bag fit in there with no problem so my stuff was always safe during the ride! Definitely a great little bag for a great price! Plus, it's so cute!"
3,Disappointment,"I bought this bag for biking. Although the quality of the bag is high and I like all the different compartments, I was disappointed because even on the smallest setting, the bag was too loose for me. Also, every time I took the bag off, the straps got looser and I had to re-tighten them all the way on both ends, which was annoying. The straps are also not very comfortable if you are wearing a sleeveless shirt. I was disappointed because you should be able to make a bag small enough to not fall of your shoulder, regardless of how tiny of a woman you are!"
5,I love this bag.,I bought this bag before I went on vacation it was great. I had room for everything I needed including water and sunscreen. I carry allot of stuff with me on a day to day basis and it has lots of nice pockets for storing stuff. If your looking for a bag to keep things together with this is great for that.
4,MORBO = MOENIA? : No exactamente,"La comparacion es inevitable. Pero sin embargo, JC Lozano incorpora nuevos sonidos que hacen a MORBO diferente de Moenia.Claro todo queda en familia. MORBO sin duda pasa a formar parte de esa musica en espan~ol que casi nunca se escucha en la radio (al menos aca en EEUU), de esa musica que lucha por ser diferente de la clasica ""balada pop"", la salsa, etc.JC Lozano definitivamente sigue rompiendo barreras. Hacen falta gente como en en un mundo musical ya saturado con tanto de lo mismo, algo que necesita un cambio urgentemente."
5,Lozano continues after Moenia,"When I first heard Morbo's first single ""Hoy"" on MTV, I thought it was Moenia. It was, sort of. After departing ways with Moenia after their first cd, Lozano produced this excellent album. Good beats and lyrics make this album a must buy for any music fan, especially those of Moenia's. An excellent choice for people not used to listening in Spanish as well. The cd is one of those albums you actually listen to every song, from beginning to end. The only drawback? Ten songs aren't enough; the cd leaves you begging for more..."
4,Morbo,I first heard this album when the video came out really liked the song and so got the album. It was this album and Zoe that was popular at the time. Morbo is just a great mix. The music flows and continues with better than normal guitar solos and memorable lyrics.
5,Sensacional!,"Soy un fan de este disco por que siempre he sido un fan del grupo electronico Moenia. Este es el primer projecto como solista de Juan Carlos Lozano quien antes era integrante del grupo Moenia. Juan Carlos Lozano era el cantante del grupo Moenia y ahora nos tray su primer disco como solista titulado igual como su nombre artistico Morbo. Los que conocen el material de Moenia van a ver similaridad en la musica de Morbo. Es casi igual con el mismo estilo electronico. Fans de Moenia y del grupo Ingles Depeche Mode a quien Moenia se ha dejado influir musicalmente, les gustaran este material discografico de Morbo. El primer sencillo de este disco ""Hoy"" es una cancion radiante y ha pegado en las estaciones de radio. Otro tema radiante es ""Ensename"". Ten por seguro que todas las temas de este material de Morbo es sensacional."
5,just what the doctor ordered great price fast delivery I will be set for a while,this help to balance my supplement intake also help me to maintain my blood pressure and over all good health
4,A creative way to teach drawing,"Cute and easy to use. If your artist can write the letters of the alphabet, then they'll be able to use this book. It's a creative way to teach drawing. My niece, who is 6, loves it and is able to draw most everthing in the book."
5,What a fun book!,"""D is for Doodle"" was given as a gift to my 4 year old nephew recently, and he absolutely loves it! He loves drawing and is learning how to write, so this book is perfect for him. It's bright, colorful, and fun for doodlers of all ages!"
3,Misleading,"The picture does not match the wording of the title, so you can imagine my surprise when I open a completely different deck from the picture. the picture should be immediately switched so there is no more future confusion. I was specifically looking for the ""fate blaster"" deck, so I might have to order another set. The deck itself is bad, but the condition it arrived in was pristine."
3,remastered dvd's blu-ray,"while you will most certainly see a difference while watching in hi-def the improvement in quality does not justify the price, however, if you are buying because you want these films for your library go for it. i have seen prices higher for standard dvd's."
1,Poor quality,"One of the legs was stripped an took a lot of the excitement out of this product. Grandson wanted to use it right away but due to the poor quality of the legs, he could not try it out. It was quite a disappointment."
2,No loseless Audio coding technology,"You know why these DVDs w/Blu-ray are cheaper, as in only $10 each? They don't have the loseless audio coding technology. That's DTS-HD Master and Dolby True HD. That's a shame. Most blu-ray movies have the latest Audio technology. Look on the back of a couple of new Blu-rays you buy or rent and you'll see it. And boy will you hear it too when you have a good stereo receiver to go with it too. Until then, why are they even continuing to make blue rays w/1080P high Video quality but not with better Audio? I don't know..."
3,"OK, Needs Improvement","I would like to compare Omega Nutritions starter to Body Ecology's starter and these store bought Kefirs: Helios, Nancy's, and Lifeways Organic line. To me, all the comparing products have one thing in common; They taste for the most part the same, that is, good. They are thick, tart, and have a ""zing"" resembling mild carbonation. The Omega Nutrition starter makes Kefir that is thick, creamy, and cultures well, but it lacks the level of tartness and ""zing"" I'm used to. So I would rate it 2 stars: OK /needs improvement, adding a 3rd star for a low price. Body Ecology's starter is my favorite so far, too bad its near three times the price. Also, I'm not comparing any of these to living grains. What I prefer about the starter kits is the guaranteed/measured strains and potency of flora and healthy yeasts. Live grains can fluctuate and/or lose their flora strains, yeast and potency levels."
2,Not as good as I would have hoped.,I recommend going with the natural cultures as a starter. This powder did not produce as fresh tasting a kefir as I would have liked.
4,Totally Love this book!,"I'm giving this book 4 start because the content is excellent. The examples are colorful and imaginative and the author's personality is displayed throughout this book so far from what I have read. I'm currently in a paralegal program and I'm taking torts I have bought this book to supplement the book and in class materials. I have to say, ""I'm impressed."" It has helped me in volunteer position at an legal assistance center and I have a feeling this is going to help me rock this class out. I know there are other materials but if you need something to supplement your learning this is something I found rather helpful."
2,Somethings Missing Here,"Defamation, Invasion of Privacy, Interference with Business Contracts, Frivilous Litigation all are missing here, this does not come close to covering all torts, buyer beware."
4,Good!,"Our professor recommended this study guide simply for the examples it provides you. I'd say that would be the main reason to get it. I think other supplements are better at clearing up confusing areas, but the E+E series is the best if you need examples and hypos to practice with. For me, that was a big necessity as our exam was just one long hypo. I tend to get very anxious in exams and I knew I needed a lot of practice to feel comfortable. In addition to old exams our professor gave us to work with, I used E+E and I'm very happy I did. There were areas I was shaky on and this book helped me clear those up."
3,Not on par with Glannon's civpro E&E,"I found this book to be too meandering to be much help in studying for my torts final. Maybe it's something to do with the subject. Some of the simpler topics were beaten to death, and I never ended up getting through the whole thing."
5,Good Book,Very helpful. Reviews of older editions mentioned that it did not include all of the intentional torts. This new edition does.
3,"Good for BLL, bad for policy","I bought this book as a supplement, not an exam review. I also have Abraham's Forms and Functions. While this text is useful for pinpoint little knacks in the law, spotting issues, and generally getting more acquainted with applications of BLL, I found it to be lacking in the policy department. A lot of really important policy arguments (even policy themes that apply to most issues like putting people on notice and best cost avoiders) just get lost. Also, I found that Glannon tends to glaze over economic arguments"
3,"Not bad, but not thorough","This is a good supplement...for the topics it includes. It's quite thorough for negligence, but has little or nothing about nuisance, defamation, and privacy. The section on product liability is minimal, and it is missing over half of the intentional torts."
2,Not a best buy,Ordered 7 of these lights. 4 of the boxes were damaged but the lights do work. Some parts of the lights were not on the lights but were in the box. Being a metal light expect it to rust. 2 have already. Sensors work real well. Too well if installed facing a road. 2 of mine are within 30 feet of a road. had to block middle of sensor even on the lowest setting to stop them from turning on everytime a vehicle passed. Wiring may be a problem because of no room inside housing for additional wire or connectors.
3,One of the Cannon Movie Tales,"Red Riding Hood is one of the many ""Cannon Movie Tales"" that I grew-up with and am happy to find released on DVD. It was by no means my favorite of the series (which includes- Snow White, Rumpelstiltskin, Beauty and the Beast, Emperor's New Clothes, Puss in Boots, Hansel and Gretal, and not released on dvd in the U.S.- Frog Prince, Sleeping Beauty). This series of movies looks like it was done all with shared sets (most of the sets from Red Riding Hood can be seen in Beauty and the Beast, Snow White, and Frog Prince) and sometimes the same actors. Red Riding Hood includes Isabella Rossellini (Merlin, Death Becomes Her) and Craig T. Nelson (Coach, Poltergeist). There's a few delightful songs, some overripe acting from the infamous ""wolf,"" and some general changes in the story to stretch it out for a full length movie. All in all I like it mostly out of nostalgia more than anything else."
1,Probably THE WORST MUSICAL EVER MADE?,"Imagine if Ed Wood made a musical, then this would be the result.Painful to watch, let alone listen to (unless you're 5 or under). The songs are weak, the recordings so 'canned', even the dialogue sounds like it was dubbed. At the same time, it's so horrifically embarrassing and so poorly made, it's almost entertaining...in small bites."
1,Yuck!,I didn't care for this movie. It had a lame story line and even worse effects. Not something I would recommend at all. Yuck!
1,Not for me,"Before ordering, please note that this is a ""killer collection of Super DJ, Paul Oakenfold's breakbeats, samples & loops. This vital assortment of highly sought after constructed breaks and beats for DJs, Producers, and musicians is a rare glimpse inside the record box of ... Oakenfold"". In other words, don't expect complete songs or cuts."
2,When Is An Album...?,...Not really an album? This CD is a collection of tracks for DJs to use as backgrond beats and samples. If I were a DJ this might be interesting but since I'm into listening to something along the lines of a well polished album this CD really disappoints. I had higher hopes since I heard Bunkka before this CD.
2,"Same Ish, New Name...","This CD was released back in the 90's under the title Sampladelica: The Roots of Paul Oakenfold. Same exact thing... Compare the tracklists if you dont believe me. It is a DJ's CD since the transition percussion lines are basically what your getting along with a few stabs and voices... Good for DJ's, not much to listen to."
3,"Helpful, But Only Just","I bought this CD back in 2003,(along with ) whilst making a documentary and I found a couple of the tracks handy for music cues, but otherwise it didn't prove to be very helpful. In an age of Garageband and Youtube, this collection is VERY dated. I would imagine a clever ""digger"" would be able to find these online very easily.I give it 2 stars as I was able to incorporate some beats and sounds into my work, but I would steer clear of this as there are better resources out there now. If you are looking for an Oakey album to listen to for fun, then this is REALLY not the one to buy."
2,A waste of money,"If your thinking this is going to be a great cd, than your so wrong. All the songs on this cd are around a minute long. Did I say songs? There just short musical examples of what Oakenfold can do. That's all. Save your money."
4,A must have for Trish Murphy fans,"This is a very scaled back offering from Trish Murphy recoreded live in Austin, TX this past summer. Along with four songs each from her previous two albums, Murphy offers five new songs. You can tell that she is having fun on the new song ""The Trouble With Trouble"" while ""Lightning Strikes"" is a beautiful, but sad song. She also tells the story behind ""Concession Stand Song"", but you'll have to buy the CD to find out what it is...Her voice is a little strained at times, but that gives the ablum a since of geniuneness that often is not there on polished studio recordings.Overall, this is a solid effort from an artist who makes music because she loves it. Give it a try, and you won't be disappointed."
1,A Piece of Junk!!!,Using Mac G4 running OS 9.2.2. 1. When plugged into a USB hub it wouldn't allow the computer to shut down or restart. 2. Downloaded newest drivers - 2 icons would appear on the desktop and still wouldn't allow shut down or restart. 3. A real pain to insert the compact flash card. Consigned to the garbage can. A waste of (Money) plus postage.
1,More junk for the landfill,"I have the SanDisk SDDR-31 USB interface unit. Serial number 0364469. This thing has *never* worked correctly. Can't tell if it's the hardware or the driver software. Originally the USB interface wouldn't work. After much pain and a driver upgrade, the unit only corrupted my photos about 1/10 of the time. Recently upgraded my Win-2K Pro op-sys to service pack 3. Now, the reader cannot tell when a compact flash is inserted. The OS popup gives me the message ""please insert media"". In other words, SP3 for Win-2k completely broke my SanDisk CF reader. This is the last straw. The next home for this unit is my local landfill..."
2,Great Idea but crashed my computer,This is a great idea and should work fairly simple.It is easy to use and easy to install yetit crashed my Windows 2000 PC perhaps it is just a conflict with another perifphal on my computer. So I tried putting it on another computer. Although there was no crash it caused another USB device not to work. You are taking a risk with this product.
5,What a songwriter !!!,"For me, being from Spain, I'd say that Fracasso is not the best commercial name for an artist, cause it means ""failure"". However, there's no simple failure on this live album. It is a good example of perfection in songwriting and performance. It's only Michael Fracasso and Charlie Sexton on guitars and vocals, but they sure do not need any other instruments. Fewer time so few instruments have been able to produce such a wonderful music. Michael's tenor voice also sounds loud and clear and shows that he is a master performer too. If you like good songwriter music, don't skip this one!"
5,Absolute Best,Thid is representative of the best of Michael. I am from Oklahoma and have seen this great and I mean great under rated artist perform at the Blue Door in OKC. Every song is amazing and this man is one of the best. I rate him as one of my very favorite artists alongside Alejandro Escovedo. If you get a chance to see this super talented humble man in concert consider yourself lucky! He is absolutely one of the best singer songwriters in the Southwest and the USA today. Thank You Michael for so many great memories.
3,roe doom 3.5,"Not bad - the obvious ""grabber"" idea is a filch from other games but the doom fans have come to expect - the scenery, the enemies the challenges for the marine are all here. I'd go with 3 of 5 stars but I found myself wanting a little more ... Maybe it was the repetitive hallways and doors or the sameness. This however is an expansion pack not a new game or upgrade so it does the job. Some replay value -= I found Quake had more of that though. Looking forward to doom4."
2,A little dissappointed,"I must say, these are not near as bright as portrayed. In fact, you can barely see them (unless it's totally dark). Kind of a waste. Nice concept, though."
5,Love these candles!,"These are exactly what I was in search of. Instead of burning candles that melt, these last so much longer! Very pretty addition to my coffee table!"
2,Good at first,This game is awsome for the first week. but once you beat it there is nothing left to do and it starts to get old really fast. Though the story was pretty long I can give it that. It got frustrating at points though like parts where before you can continue you have to buy fronts which you get the money for them buy distibuting drugs to your current fronts but first you have to get the drugs to disstribute and after all of that you don't make hardly any profit. It has good and bad but overall it sucks.
5,A must have for those who enjoy the best.,"A timeless masterpiece by two of the great singers of the 20th century. Classic and smooth, are the songs they sing. Their voices adding unique and favorable tones for your listening pleasure. The Christmas Song, sung by Nat King Cole, has a way of getting you into that Christmas Spirit. While Winter Wonderland, sung by Dean Martin, always gets me wishing it would snow real soon. Both of the artist do exceptional renditions of what to me have always been the classic's of Burl Ives, Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer and Silent Night. The layout of the songs makes for an enjoyable 45 minutes of music heaven during the Christmas Holiday season and many more seasons to come."
4,Nice CD,"I like this CD! There is some really nice guitar work here. it is clean sounding, well played and with really beautiful arrangements. If you are looking for something good to play in the background that isn't up in your, face this CD is perfect. I am looking forward to the first rainy night where I can turn out all the lights, pour a drink and put it on. Now that would be a very relaxing evening!"
1,More disappointed with the seller than the product,Okay well 1st when I got the product I opened it and it wasn't what I thought it was wrong size kit for my pool!it also looks very cheaply made an then was proven to me that is in fact is... My mother ordered the same exact kit and within 2 weeks it was broke!!! Anyways I wrote the seller and they said to send it back so I did with tracking number and everything and guess what STILL NOTHING AND THIS WAS BACK IN LASF PART OF JULY FIRST OF AUGUST
2,still where i started,the test kit was ok but the instructions crumbled up in lil pieces when i opened the package & since i never used a kit before on a pool i had no idea how to test the water.also the maintenance kit didnt come with any type of pole so i still have to go purchase one that will fit those parts...im still with a untested & un cleaned pool
2,"If you like Said, you'll love it, if not what do you expect?","I find that I disagree with Said just slightly more than I agree with him. The book, a collection of Essays/magazine articles has some valuable insights, but as anyone who has read Said knows, he takes more than a few pages to say what could be condensed to a paragraph or two sentences.Of course, my other criticism is that so much of his work is laden with his personal baggage, this being no exception. However, this is not an attack on Mr. Said. As I said, there are some gems in this book so, if you have the time, and you are not easily offended by one who is so often critical of the West, this book may be perfect for you."
5,A satisfying intellectual journey,"This book takes you onto a spectacular and highly satisfying intellectual journey. Many essayists set up their tent with the first couple of paragraphs and then spend the rest of the time just rearranging the furniture inside. With Said, one never knows what point he might make next, what brilliant new connection will be created before our eyes. You can tell by reading this collection how Said won his reputation as a fantastic lecturer and educator. I guess this is why Columbia University stuck by him when he was being vilified by his enemies for championing the Palestinian cause and demanding the end of Israeli occupation. Buy it, read it, enjoy!"
3,"Stephen Silberman, you've made a mistake","Mr. Silberman, can't you hear that Singin' Call is most likely an outtake from SS 2 rather than a recent remake? Your comments about the inferiority of the playing and the vocals to the original version of the song are pretty funny, given that any fan who listens to the Stills Alone version in the context of the other songs on Stills Alone can tell from the vocal quality and guitar sound that the song was recorded decades ago. You may not know Stills' work quite as well as you think you do."
5,Very. very good,"I always enjoyed the music and voice of Stephen Stills, but had lost track of him for a long time. A few months ago I kept hearing this track ""Tree Top Flyer"" playing on a local college radio station and recognized the unmistakeable voice and guitar stylings. I bought the cd and have played it about a kazillion times. Simple, sweet, bluesy and unconventional are words I would use to describe the cd. Stills showcases his undeniable talent for the guitar and his unique vocal stylings on a combination of originals such as ""Isn't it So"" and one some covers such as Dylan's ""Ballad of Hollis Brown."" Still performs soulful renditions of the Beatles' ""In My Life"" and Nilsons' ""Everybody's Talkin'"", but the highlight of the cd remains his very original, very introspective ""Treetop Flyer."" Get this cd!"
2,Phoned In,"Look, I love the guy. I'm not going to waste bandwidth presenting my Stills bona fides. Suffice it to say, I'm dumbstruck as to what Stills, his management, his wife, his kids or his agent thought would be achieved by releasing this CD. Treetop Flyer is the one semi-gem in this collection, and I agree with the others who've posted their dislike of the electrified acoustical insturmentation. It's pure Vegas. But gawdamn it, I bought it anyways in spite of the reviews. [...]"
2,"Nice thought, mediocre execution","Had Stills recorded this album in 1970, it would have been a masterpiece, but by the time he got around to recording his first solo acoustic record, his chops were not half of what they had been, and his voice showed the wear of a thousand nights on the road. On the very best tracks here -- such as ""Hollis Brown"" -- there's a seasoned, soaked-in-mystery quality that does credit to Stills' former stature. But listen to the unnecessary remake of ""Singin' Call,"" which was one of the highlights of Stephen Stills 2. He blows the phrasing, the fingerpicking doesn't have half the force of the earlier version, and instead of sounding like a transmission from a mountaintop, it sounds like a weary recital from a porch. As a longtime fan, I wish this had been better."
2,slurred vocals,"Not trying to be cruel, but was he already slurring back in the early 90's? Listening to him today is sad - did he have a stroke or oral cancer? Loved the Byrds, Springfield, CSNY and early solo stuff but some performers need to stop thinking they sound as good as they used to."
5,The best acoustic I've heard on a CD!,"Stills Alone is the best CD in my 175 CD collection. He moves me with his acoustic guitar and the songs played are amazing. The better your system, the better it gets in your head."
2,Not So Solid,"This record has its own sort of charm, and I like most of the music in principle. That said, though, there's something remarkably sub-par about this. To say that Stephen's voice is decimated is a large understatement. On the surface, it has a nice acoustic guitar feel, but once one listens to a few songs, it becomes apparent that something is wrong with the plunky guitar licks. They just don't fit. I love Stephen Still's music, but this just isn't up there among my favorites."
1,So massively disappointing.,"The only problem with this is the recording of the guitar. It is an electrified acoustic run into a board off a contact pickup and is sounds like Stills is playing a block of cheese with strings. And, for me, this is a massive problem because it robs the album of everything it could have been. The sound of a vintage acoustic - and Still owns a bunch of pre-WWII Martins including at least one original D-45 - recorded with a high quality microphone is exquisite (check out David Grisman's ""Tone Poems"" series if you want a reference) and it's what this album should be. The decision to record the instrument in the manner here ruins the album. Reviews are subjective by nature so let me say that it ruins it for me, entirely. Anyone interested in this record should know about this shortcoming and, if it isn't a big distraction for you, then you will probably enjoy it as the material and performances are fine. Other than it being unlistenably bad."
4,Concise and entertaining,This book is a straight forward introduction to aquinian phylosophy. I was first introduced to it reading the autobiography of Pope Paul. Where it was refered to frequently. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the subject but doesn't want to get bogged down with a lot of details. Snt Thomas's phylosophy is Aristotal's concept of natural law from a Christian perspective.
3,Beginners Should Start Elsewhere,"I gave up on ""Ethica Thomistica"" 2/3 of the way through. Individual parts are excellent, but, overall, I didn't find the book to be helpful or beginner-friendly. The presentation is disorganized, terms are introduced without proper definitions, Thomas' ethical thought isn't related to his broader metaphysics, and close analysis of texts is surprisingly rare. McInerny also grinds an annoying Catholic ax, as when he complains that Catholic Supreme Court justices aren't ""Catholic enough"" or when he insists that the sole legitimate purpose of sex is reproduction. Not recommended."
4,Good stuff by MC Solaar,"This album is not as great as ""Prose Combat"", but all in all this is a good cd. Once again, Solaar's lyrics stand out over everything else. One thing about this album that I did'nt like that much was so many English flares to it. Such as ""Wonderbra"", ""Daydreamin"", etc... Best songs on this cd are ""Paradisiaque"", ""Les Pensees sont des flowers"", ""Protege Tibia"". I think American rap artists can learn a thing or two from Solaar and his lyrics, because they're lyrics are very poor and have no feel or meaning to it."
4,écoutez!,Great CD. Rap and French go together like peanut butter and chocolate. These songs get stuck in your head.
5,Solaar's best beats,"THis is my favorite album of his purely for the beats. They are rips of American beats, i know, but he mixes them; combined with his flow, an all-the-way-thruer, rare for hip-hop, although not for Solaar."
3,Very cool French rap......with some English twists.....,"Although I had previously never heard rap in French before, I was amazed when I heard MC Solaar! I think that this CD was excellent and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes French music."
5,"Deep Schmeep, Give Me Solaar","I found Paradisiaque relatively light considering the torching protest lyrics of Prose Combat. Alright, it's not verbal violence, but it, musically, is characterized by the same smooth style Solaar always flows. In fact, I find the music on Paradisiaque better than Prose Combat, at some times edgy and quick, at others melodic and entrancing. All in all an excellent album."
1,Trent Reznor needs drugs.,"Seriously. Somebody force Trent Reznor to get back on cocaine as quickly as possible. Without his source of inspiration, his music will just get worse from here on, and his idea of purchase-worthy releases will continue to confound and anger his fans. He'll wind up like Pink Floyd after Roger Waters left, with only a mere shred of his former musical glory left. For the good of the world, give Trent Reznor drugs right now."
4,Trent continues his push for a disco revival,"As a former recovering Nine Inch Nails fan who re-appraised the band's goodness after the release of the surprisingly fresh ""With Teeth"" last year, I must say that this remix EP is quite a treat. For those who loved the 'get-up-and-dance' disco-ey fun of 'The Hand that Feeds' and 'Only' (myself included) will find much to like in the 5 highly addictive remixes on this album. Granted, this isn't in the doom-and-brood league of ""Further Down the Spiral,"" but more indicative of Mr. Reznor's current straightforward pop sensibility...so kick back and party like it's 1999, kids."
4,"Great ""single"" album","I purchased this based on hearing the remix on Pandora. I'm a Nails fan, and liked the other remixes that were on this album."
4,Halo 21,"Everyday is Exactly the same. Its a good effort, it starts off with Everday is Exactly the Same which of course is good by it self I mean if you dont like the song why buy the single for it? It goes into to already released The Hand That Feeds remixs. Which if you have a open mind and are not just for NIN only style then you will enjoy them. That leads into two Only remixes. Which in my opinion are the best on the album. More of a dance kind of feel to them. Which leads to the last song The remix of the single. Its good, has a very trance like feel. If your a fan of NIN or you just want to check them out this is a good start. Not the best, but you wont throw this away."
4,Wootness Bootness,"I enjoyed this little nosh of music.The 80's-sounding remixes were awesome. :)I also read earlier that someone disliked track 4....Dear God, why?! That track has to be my most favorite on the disc!It has that trip-hop-ish feel to it that I just so happen to thrive off of. :)(I can't live without Massive Attack & Portishead, i'll have you know.)I also liked the pseudo-instrumental version of Every Day.The Photek mix of The Hand was 'good'.But for the most part, the whole compilation was a tasty tidbit of music.I approve, and am looking forward to devouring more. :)"
3,One of TWO With Teeth Products You Should Own,"Unlike the other guy, I'm not going to tell you that you should own everything by Nine Inch Nails. If I had my choice of owning everything With Teeth related, I would choose only this one, AND the Japanese With Teeth release with bonus tracks ( 4988005388780 ), both of which I own and more, so it's too late for me, but if it's not too late for you then hopefully this helps. 8 tracks, 4 actual different original songs, these are all ""versions"", i.e. different versions of With Teeth. Personally, I just always have felt and still do feel that the way to succeed With Teeth is just to release all of the rough mixes and that's it. But this is the opposite, it is remixes, if you think that you will like that, I don't know if you will or not so don't ask me. 6/10"
2,Eh.....,"The title track is decent, considering that the album, ""With Teeth,"" was underwhelming at best.One of the mixes for ""Hand that Feeds"" is awesome; ditto for one of the ""Every Day..."" mixes. Other than that, I'd bypass this release. I don't say that lightly, since I've been a NIN fan and collector since '90. Pick this up if you find it for a decent price.2 stars... one for each good remix.***end of line***"
3,Format way too large,"If you like ""coffee-table book"" sized cookbooks, then this cookbook will be fine for you. Personally, I find the huge fomat of this book totally impractical for use in the kitchen. Even in an upright holder, it would probably get splattered eventually. Also, many of the recipes are for fresh pasta, which I just don't have time to make.Of course, Williams and Sonoma always have great recipes, but I would recommend getting one of their smaller format pasta cookbooks, unless you love coffee table books with big, pretty photographs. Just not practical enough for me."
4,Media molto alta,"Veramente azzeccato per chi cerca il Van Morrison dei primi anno, sanguigno, rock & bluesy.buona raccolta dei primi brani di van e di altri autori"
1,Not For Me.,I just couldnt get into this Cd. Garys voice just sounds kind ofweird trying to sing this type of music. It sounds like he should be singing something else. A lot of the songs deal with Parents dealing wing with their children. Some Good lyrics though.
2,Gary's Experimental Album,"I am a long time fan of Gary's. When I read that Gary was doing the production himself I was enthused. Unfortunately, this causes the album to sound like a poorly produced demo. It must be noted that Gary's primary instrument is the guitar, which he plays very well. However, this some what limits him in his arrangements. Gary is forced to fill the tracks with a cheap sounding synthesizer/keyboard. This is unfortunate due the sterile and motionless feel of the instrument which sounds like midi computer music. His voice is beautiful and powerful, as it never fails to soar. His song writing on the album is genius. He is a true talent. If you wish to enjoy this fully, I would recommend one of his previous, professionally produced albums. Give ""Shelter"" a try, you won't be disappointed!"
4,A-Team Season Five,"Being 21 years old I have watched the A-Team most of my life and I am a big fan of the show. I love the first four seasons and I just received the fifth season and the episodes I have seen are really good. I do have to get use to that Frankie character still as well as Stockwell but still the shows are good. I've only seen the episodes on the first disk and the third disk since Amazon.com sent me a season five package with two disk three's but I have contacted them and they are sending a replacement with two day shipping and thankfully no charge to me, so hopefully disc two will be with this new set that is coming and I will then get to see those episodes as well."
2,final season,"The only season that really sucked. Murdock, sane? What! You take away my favorite part of the show and give him drivel activities and expect me to stick with you? Nope. Frankie isn't so bad of an addition to the team, I could have lived with that addition even more than I put up with the second reporter of season three."
5,Go A Team,The A Team has been a favorite for years. George Peppard is excellent as a leader and shows true friendship to his fellow teammates. Well written and family entertainment!!
4,A TEAM 5TH SEASON,i'VE BEEN A FAN OF THE A TEAM SHOW FOR YEARS. ALTHOUGH I REALLY ENJOYED THIS DVD SET I DON'T THINK IT'S AS GOOD AS THE FIRST FOUR SEASONS.
4,A-Team review,"Though this years program was not the best of the series, it's nice to complete the whole shows run. The qaulity of the shows on this disk is really good. No complaints and it arrived in really good time as it was a Christmas present."
4,"Mothers, Daughters, and Psychics in Suburbia","This is a quick and enjoyable read which touches on the trials of bringing up an adolescent daughter in a typical suburban community when you are not the most traditional parent imaginable.Miriam's extraordinary psychic abilities exacerbate the normal prickly tensions between mother and daughter and this novel explores both the tensions and abilities with humor and style.The ins and outs of the plot keep you turning the pages - financial troubles, boyfriend troubles, and the business of being a telephone psychic were all of great interest to this reader. I recommend it very highly to mothers and daughters."
4,Creative and fun,This book is both creative and fun to read. Nice read for those who like to learn about historical figures.
1,DO NOT TRUST- mine EXPLODED,"Last night I measured 4 cups of boiling water into this pyrex dish to pour into a recipe, poured the water and set it down on the counter. As I started to walk away it sounded like a gunshot. The glass was all over in a 5 foot radius. I just got this measuring cup for x-mas, it is new. Just do a search for exploding pyrex and you will see that I am not the only one this has happened to with newer pyrex. I am just glad it didn't explode with the boiling water in it, and burn my feet or my dogs. Buyers Beware!!!!"
3,Works for Lefties,"I bought this cup because I am left handed and most measuring cups have the US measurments on the side for right handed people. I have to take the cup in my right hand to measure. This cup has the numbers on both sides so it works perfectly for me or anyone else. I haven't thought of a reason to use the lid yet, but I am sure I will.The only problem with it is it is a little heavy."
1,Lid does not seal-not airtight,"I have 3 pyrex measuring cups. I bought this one bec I make my own salad dressing every 2 days and store the rest in the fridge. I got tired of wasting saran wrap to cover. Naturally you would buy the cup with the lid to keep things fresh. Unfortunately, this is not even close to airtight. The ""seal part"" goes straigt down the glass and does not seal off the outside air. And it does not keep other smells from creeping in. The spout on the glass is good for pouring. The lid is something else to wash. It is useless."
3,"Good for measuring, bad for pouring","I bought this and the 8-cup measure from Pyrex. If I had it to do over again, I would buy the Anchor brand instead. The pyrex ones are great and all, but when you go to pour the liquid out, it just runs down the outside edge and doesn't just flow over the pour spout. It can make a big mess. The Anchor ones (I have a 2-cup measure Anchor one) has an edge around the pour spout that works really well at controlling how fast the liquid flows out and where it goes. I also found that the lids don't really fit that well, a little too snug so it's hard to get the lid on at all so I never use it."
4,Can't Go Wrong,You can't go wrong with a Pyrex product. My only issue with this is the lid. It doesn't exactly fit on the best or really do much good. I don't usually use the lid so it's not a big problem. The size is great and the product is very durable.
5,Pyrex 4 cup bowl,"I broke my large pyrex bowl three days before Chritmas, I phoned all over town and went to my closes stores and there was not one in stock. I called Amazona and ordered it and it was at my house in 24hours. I cannot do with out this large bowl. Thank you Amazon for saving me hardship when I measure for stuffing, etc for Christmas."
4,The Rich Man's Wife,"A rich man's wife finds she has a bad prenuptial agreement with an even worse husband. Over drinks with a stranger, she fantasizes about doing her husband in to void the prenupt. The stranger decides to turn her imagination into reality much to the wife's surprise. This isn't a bad movie, it is entertaining, made you guess most of the time, and is pretty tense. The movie itself is predictable, but it is good, and it worth watching. Halle Berry is sensational as The Rich Man's Wife. The ending is especially satisfying, making your jaw drop to the ground."
1,A terrible mess,I bought this movie looking for a great flick to watch. WRONG. This a huge waste of Halle Berry and anyone who starred in it with her. The plot is stupid. It is just a waste of time. If you want to see Halle Berry watch Die another day. That's real good and fun. This turkey is for the dumpster.
2,Makes 'Catwoman' Look Like Shakespeare...,"...and with the exception of Catwoman, thank gawd Halle ran into better roles after this stinko. Wait a minute. She did 'Baps', too."
1,Hocus Pocus,Book is cute but it missed pages that someone tore out. Very disapointed. I was expecting something better than what I got.
1,Hocus Pocus? More like Mumbo Jumbo...,"I wanted to give it less than one star, but there was no such rating on the system. The cover alone was enough to warn me about the validity (or lack thereof) of this book. As I have read several books on Witchcraft/Wicca, the first thing I looked at (after the cover of course) was the love spell(s). The spell/s listed actually required you to take the bodily secretions or hair clippings from your intended victim, & use those things to bind this person to you.As a practitioner, I know that this is simply wrong. It goes completely against the principles of ""harm none"" and ""free will."" You can't ""make"" someone fall in love with you, no matter what anybody may tell you. All relationships must be fostered over time.For romance or friendship, try going to a bookstore or coffee shop--and actually striking up a conversation. It's very simple and it actually works!"
2,Hocus Pocus,can someone email me i have not read the book but would love info.cherie_21205@yahoo.com
5,"For Two to Play, by Davitt Moroney and Olivier Baumont","Superb harpsichord music ... Mozart, Handel, J.C. Bach, Tomkins. Energizing, powerful, beautiful, skillful, gracious, clever, ominous ... listen stereophonically with headphones; listen in your car ... magnificent. I find it ubiquitously encompassing and exquisitely pleasing to my senses ... daemonic. Perfection."
2,"Interesting, But Not Worthwhile","My boyfriend and I gave this a whirl while driving back from Melbourne to Sydney and as we were driving at night the first song, (piece?), is atmospheric and worked fairly well. The rest of the album is pretty dodgy. Neither of us realised we'd tuned out and hadn't heard a lot of the album and only realised that the Beatles song was what it was about halfway through it. It's just that awful as a cover, actually it's that awful in its' own right too. Neither of us can recommend it for anyone other than a diehard fan."
1,giles provokes no smiles,This is a dreadful mish mash of post modernistic rubbish. Anthony can sing and could do so much better if given the right material. He needs to get someone who can write both lyrics and music. As it is this does nothing to promote English musical talent; which is a shame to have to admit as I am English.
1,Hate to say it but.. Disappointing CD,I am a HUGE Buffy the Vampire Slayer fan and Anthony Stewart Head as Giles was one of my favorite characters. I flipped over his voice when he sang on several episodes and thought this cd would be amazing. I had it on my wish list for a long time and my husband finally surprised me with it for my birthday last year.It took me four days to listen to it all the way through and I think I only listened to it the one time. Tony Head's voice is great BUT the music and background vocals are awful. The songs are not well written. Just blah. Listening to the cd I kept thinking if I could find a way to take the music and backup vocals and lower their volume WAY down so I could listen to Tony sing better. The songs might be better than I think but the bad music and backup vocals are so distracting I just can't tell.
2,At Least the Title Was Appropriate,"I was truly disappointed with this album. While I adore ASH's voice, the style of the songs was really more suited for elevator music. One reviewer described the album as morose. So true. Inlcuded in the credits are three stars from ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"". Unfortunately, their parts were indestinguishable from the rest. No vocals from James Marsters or Amber Benson. I felt as if it was the slightest nod by ASH to his coworkers, while serving as a catch for BtVS fans.I would have rather saved the money."
2,Not what I was expecting...,"I love Tony Head's voice, but the music on this CD just wasn't what I was expecting. I had hoped for some light jazz/adult contemporary songs, but it's more dance/electronica."
4,Hidden tracks the best - ASH please make an acoustic CD!,"I was sorry to listen to this CD, expecting a chance to hear ASH's unique timbre and clear voice. Instead, I heard way too much synth, beats, wurly, and special effects. The lyrics are moving - when you can hear them or when you are not being yelled at.THEN I was told about the hidden tracks and my ... was not wasted! The first is a gentle piano piece where you can hear ASH and the second, while it had synth and beats still featured ASH prominently (plus a little Alyson Hannigan and if you are very patient some James Marsters thrown in for fun.)If anyone who has any influence with ASH reads this...PLEASE - get him to record an ""unplugged"" album! George Sarah is probably very good - just not my style so I can't comment on his half of this. I'm more into the solo guitar style that ASH performed as Giles in BTVS doing Free Bird and Behind Blue Eyes.Anyway - overall - the last two songs SAVE this CD."
4,Could have been better.,"I had seen Anthony in British items, way before Buffy. However, Buffy was where I first heard Anthony's singing voice. I thought he sounded awesome in the version of behind blue eyes by the Who. So, I had to get this album. I really believe they could have used Anthony better on this album. The album is pretty good, but like I said they could have used Anthony's talent better."
4,Buffy's Giles goes Electronic - and it works.,"I admit to being a rabid Buffy the Vampire Slayer fanatic, so the idea that I ordered this CD from the actor who play's Giles on the series is no shocker. The surprise is how much I genuinely _like_ the album. George Sarah provides smooth back beats and grooves that highlight ASH's soulful voice, and the lyrics keep you throughly engaged. ""Owning my Mistakes"" is my favorite track so far. . .""Well, there's nothing ever come from guilt / better give it up, give it up and move on."" I loved listening for the brief cameos from BtVS's James Marsters (Spike), Amber Benson (Tara) and Alyson Hannigan (Willow - don't worry, she has a speaking bit - not singing). My only wish is that ASH used more of his lovely deep baritone range, rather than keeping in his tenor. If you like Portishead, you'll like this record. And if you love BtVS or ASH - you'll love it."
3,Give Him A Guitar,"Anthony Stewart Head has an incredibly musical and powerful voice. I would love to see him do another CD with acoustic instruments. The techno music was too overpowering and the voice track was close to lost beneath bells and whistles. It was amazing to hear such a huge voice almost reduced to background noise.Please... do it again. Such a sexy voice should be accompanied by instrumental, not the other way around.Oddly, I'd love to hear him do the song 'War' and 'Mockingbird', among others."
3,Head's up,"By far the strongest song on this album is the one written by Joss Whedon ('Last Time'). Whedon has a way with words, and Head's got an actor's talent for phrasing and a pleasant, natural voice. I'm not too keen on Head's own lyrics, though the second stand out song, 'Babies', is probably the most grown up (avoiding the word 'adult' here) song a father's ever written for his children. I find George Sarah's music a bit derivative, or perhaps a tad old fashioned. British musicians were doing this loungy trip hop stuff half a decade ago, and they were doing it better. Head's voice comes out strongest in those songs that aren't packed with synths and beats. Perhaps aim for an accoustic album next time? Because I do want to hear a second album. I mean... it's GILES!"
5,Fantas-matic!,"Ah, Yes. I am a huge ASH fan. No doubt about that... So when I was able to get this CD I was uber excited.I was also very much so NOT disappointed!If you enjoy a more soft rock/techie tone, then this Cd is for you!I think currently my favorite song is 'End Game', but it changes from day to day. =]"
4,A Head above the rest !,"I normally don't write reviews but I really wanted to comment on this CD.Being a fan of Buffy and instantly falling in love with Giles' voice, I knew id buy whatever Tony Head released,purely just for his gorgeous voice.The album is easy to listen to - I really liked it - my fave song being 'Babies', along with 'All the fun of the fair' and 'Owning my mistakes'. The music does tend to overpower Tony's brilliant voice - would be good if he did an album with just him and a guitar - but if your a fan of Anthony Stewart Head like me, you'll love it whatever."
1,music-person,"""Music for Elevators"" this is not! I bought this based on the singing ability of Anthony Stewart Head and the title. I was expecting soft music/ballads...something relaxing. This CD is nothing but Techno-Pop or more appropriatly Techno-Garbage. Half the time you can't even hear his voice over the music. It is a waste of a fine voice and talent."
3,No Expectations,"For anyone buying this CD thinking that they're going to get a whole disc full of Giles, you will be mistaken. The music is a little technoy (ambient) but still pretty good. A couple of songs are very catchy."
4,Pleasant Surprise,"I will admit that I bought this CD as a fan of the ""Whedonverse;"" I was thrilled to find that ""Giles"" had a CD! The musical style was very different from what I expected but it was a pleasant surprise. The lyrics are well written, poignant and stay with you. Overall, I like the CD very much and hope to hear that Anthony Stewart Head will release more music. And, as a fan of all things created by and connected to Joss Whedon, I hope that he'll continue to write songs for Tony to sing and that Amber Benson, James Marsters, and Alyson Hannigan will continue to make guest appearances! It's a thrill for fans like me!"
4,Music From the Heart,"Didn't know quite what to expect but this CD quickly grew on me. I felt it was a very personal album for him and found some of the lyrics very moving. ""My Babies"" is a beautiful and poignant song. I have come to love every track, even ""This Town in the Rain"" which I didn't like at first. There is definitely a ""Sting"" flavour on some tracks but I still feel it is pure Anthony Stewart Head overall. The first time I ever heard him sing on Buffy it really blew me away. I hope he makes another album which highlights his voice more."
2,A review from Oregon,"I was frankly disappointed. Tony Head has such a marvelous voice, as do the other people involved in this CD, and to hardly be able to make out the words on many of the cuts due to the overpowering music, especially the drums, left me wishing I could have heard it before purchase. I don't think I would have bothered. I loved the Buffy Musical and I expected an entire CD with that soft, delicious voice. If you like a hard pounding beat and don't care about what is being sung, then this is the CD for you."
5,"intriguing, intelligent, classy and well done to all!","This cd is beautifully put together.Simply said, It truly is. Anthony Stewart Head often has very Sting esque qualities in this, especially in 'This town in the Rain' and 'Owning my Mistakes'. All of the Buffy lot do a fabulous job, esp. Amber and James - Amber has an absolutely stunning voice, and I'd say 'All the fun of the fair' was my favourite on the album by far. The vocal and lyrics are both poignant and clever, with a very haunting melody. Well worth a buy for all Sting fans - you'll love it, but also those who like acoustic music that has a new and original take on things. George Sarah has done a stunning job, as has ASH. Go and Purchase!!"
4,anthony's voice made me buy this album,"As a big buffy and Tony fan i just had to have this album. it kinda dissapoints me that it's al kinda techno... but i don't think anthony's voice sounds like someone who sings techno... it's a shame (like the other reviews said) that it's not just him with a guitar, since that's the only way we see tony in buffy(that is if he's not with his head in the books:D) i do however think that the lyrics of the songs are perfect and that you have to buy the cd just for tony's sweet voice!"
4,Woah-- surprise!,"I knew A.S.H. could sing... but I still bought this album mostly for the camp value.Boy, was I surprised when I popped it in. Half the album is good, not great... the other half is amazing. The kind of stuff that I personally would have purchased on the strength of one or two songs heard on the radio.Fans of downtempo, chill out music will definitely enjoy this. From the spacey, pulse fortified opening ""What Can You Tell Me"", to the blues inspired bass and vocal ""This Town in the Rain,"" Anthony Stewart Head shows he can not only sing, but write provocative, interesting, image-laden lyrics.Definitely worth a listen!"
5,MUSIC FOR ELEVATORS,I Love the music the words and am a big fan. I listen to it all the time and hope everyone will give it a try. WoW .....
2,Anthony!,"Okay so I've been listening to Anthony's voice in Once More with Feeling and so well he's an awesome singer. So I wanted to know if he had a cd and turns out he did. I listened to some of the songs and well I didn't quite like the electric guitar and all. I was disappointed. I mean I like his voice and his singing and all but i would have to agree with the most of you, I can hear him a lot better with the acoustic guitar! =)"
2,Poor layout and confusing pedagogy,"I am currently using this text and am not thrilled with it. It has a poor layout, the reference material is strewn throughout and not very complete, and its presentation of the introductory material is neither particularly logical nor comprehensive. Its international use is only somewhat limited by its focus on Latin American Spanish and its US viewpoint. I hope there are other introductory spanish texts available that are better value for money."
4,Forget the story -- The RIFLE is the star,"This movie is marvelously photographed but the story is a bit lame. Tom Selleck plays Quigley a distinquished rifle shooter from the American West who goes to Australia seeking employment to remove some ""pests"".The Quigley character is too much of a bad-ass to be believable and that's the greatest flaw. The real star is Quigley's rifle -- a .50 caliber Sharps Model 1874 Buffalo Rifle. A tremendous piece for it's day capable of astounding long range accuracy in the hands of the trained.In the ""show me what you got"" scene Quigley demonstrates shooting the Sharps in the off hand standing position at a target about a quarter mile away. Sorry, but even the most achieved marksman would seek out some artificial support for such a challenging shot -- but hey -- Quigley is a bad -ass capable of anything!"
5,Quigley Down Under,This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I think this would be viewable for any and all from 12 years up. Thanks
3,Entertaining,"Selleck lacks the powerful on screen presence that's required for a great western like say Eastwood or even other action adventure stars like Harrison, Gibson or Willis, but that being said, this is still an entertaining movie. The story is engaging and there are some good shoot outs. It isn't an all action thriller, though, and tends to lean towards a political statement and tries too hard (unsuccessfully) to have the costars feminine emotions and problems be a compelling part of the story. While this isn't a ""got to own it"" movie, it is worth watching and a mild recommendation."
3,Good.,It was a pretty darn good movie. I am not a big fan of western's but it was very intriguing and well worth the viewing.
4,Classic Tom Selleck,"Great movie. As always, you will like Tom Selleck's character. He is the good guy that grows and develops through the movie. A little violent at times, but if a little old fashion shot-em up does not bother you, you should like this."
4,An entertaining western.,Tom Selleck is very good as Matthew Quigley. It is refreshing to watch a movie without vulgar language and where the 'good' guy really is likeable.
4,Alan Rickman did it for me,"I always enjoy a western with a very good guy agaginst an ultra evil guy, which this film offers altogether with a strong, powerful storyline. There's a lot a good humor and great action here. Tom Selleck is the perfect do-gooder, but even better is Alan Rickman's portrayal of the slick, venomous land baron dressed in black from head to toe, of course. His presence made the movie what it was. I almost hated seeing him get his due justice."
5,BEST movie tom selleck has ever made,This is the best movie i have ever seen in my hole life. Tom selleck is a great actor in this film. It sets back in Australia back in the cowboy days and is very intresting. He helps save aberigenies from an american theif. It is a very good movie and sugest you buy it.
2,2/3 good,About 2/3 of the movie was excellent but the last 1/3 had so much noise and static on the tape it was not viewable and hearable
1,Boring film and unrealistic.,A boring and unrealistic film about Tom Selleck's character being brought in to shoot aborigines to clear them off a station.It incorrectly shows aborigines in large tribes.This may be true of American Indians but this is a different culture and the idea of whites willy nilly doing this is offensive and racist as well as historically false.
1,Screen too wide,This movie itself is good in VHS but the DVD super wide scren 2.35 aspect ratio makes the picture on my TV screen narrow and only fills half the screen. Had I known I would have stuck with the VHS version.
4,"Unique ""Western""","The scenery and staging for Quigley were exceptional, as are all Selleck movies. Personally, I think any production with Tom Selleck will be top drawer."
5,No One Makes a Better Cowboy than Tom Selleck!,"Tom is the (delicious) sharpshooting cowboy in this action western set in Australia! One of his best movies!Alan Rickman is the evil cattle baron who hires Quigley to kill off wild dogs when in reality, he wants him to kill thenative Aborigines from his ranch! Then Quigley must single-handedly go after his employer & his body guards!A great story, set in a beautiful continent! Wonderful to watch a good ""Western"" again!"
5,poppie,One of the best old-style westerns. Tom Seleck is outstanding! Wish more of these westerns would be written for movies.
3,Quigley ... not a bad movie,"It was sort of a Revisionist Western. It was set in the Colonial period of Australia . The best things were* the cinematography of Australia's glorious landscape. Most of it shot around Alice Springs where I lived the a while.* adequate performances from the 3 main characters ..Tom Selleck, Laura San Giacomo currently seen as Maya Gallo in TV show ""Just Shoot Me"", and Alan Rickman .... and it has dingo's too""Quigley"" is a reasonable action movie which revealed the truth of our shameful past."
5,A Great Western with a twist!,"Mr. Selleck and Mr. Rickman have done a great job in taking the classic western and adding a great switch to the formula. If you want a good story with some great acting and scenery, then here you go! The only problem is that a Rifle almost steals the movie!"
4,"Bigger Bullets, Bigger Holes!","""And the award for 'best portrayal of a crazy woman' goes to ... "". Well played characterizations, excellent cinematography, and a little magic make this a fun movie for all. Yes, the plot has holes in it big enough you can see them from 900 yards off, and yes, the ""We're superior to the rest of the world (Yanks vs. Aussies and Redcoats)"" attitude is embarrasingly obvious. Inspite of this cavalier atmoshpere and the near total disregard to historical accuracy, I really enjoy this film and recommend it to just about anybody ... unless of course you are from DownUnder or from Across the Pond."
3,A Must for Rickman fans,"I was recently introduced to Alan Rickman when I rented his film, Snowcake. Since then I have made it a point to view his extensive body of work, and it has been a most enjoyable adventure. I noticed in the the reviews that people are most impressed with his past portrayels of villains and and vipers. What a shame that they aren't aware of his astounding range; Rickman is wonderful in comedic roles (Galaxy Quest, Dogma). He is equally comfortable in romantic leads (Truly, Madly, Deeply, Sense and Sensibility). Every part he touches, he turns to gold, and I am certain that he will show us even more hidden talents when Sweeney Todd opens in December.Quigley was enjoyable to watch, but one viewing was satisfactory for me. Rickman polishes each one of his scenes to a high shine. Selleck is a natural for this role. San Giacomo did not fit into her character, but not for lack of trying. I think she simply was miscast."
3,Selleck Shines as a real hero,"Being an avid Tom Selleck fan--esp. Westerns, this one has some very good points. Tom is great as the American who comes to 'conquer' down under. The plot is interesting and not too predicatable...One down side is the hocus poccus with the aboringinies and their vodoo.The scene where they are tormented by the hateful white cowboys is a bit too Polticially Correct. It is also heart breaking. Chances are that after such treatment,the murderous cowboys would have gotten a very unfriendly late night visit from the natives. Over all worth the price.It is not filled with drinking or womanizing as are a few of his other films."
5,awesome,tom selleck all his moviies are great and this one came just as stated and it is so worth every penny spent on it great buy
5,totally my favorite movie,My mom and i used to watch this movie when i was younger and i'm going to go over to her house and watch it with her like i did when i was young to spend some time with her. Delivery was fast and packaging was great! totally recommend buying from this company.
3,a great cowboy,"Matthew Quigley is a sharpshooter from the old west who answers a job advertisement and ends up in Australia. Once there he hooks up with Crazy Cora and founds himself at odds with his employer when he finds out his true job.Tom Selleck was born to play a cowboy. He looks totally at ease in the saddle, he doesn't look like a Hollywood pretty-boy when he dresses in the standard western fare, and goodness knows, fans of the Rosie O'Donnell show know that Tom is at ease with a gun. Then add in the fact that he is a actor at ease with both drama and comedy and he is made for this movie.Thankfully he is matched against one of the best villain actors of all time in Alan Rickman. Rickman has been fantastic in every movie that he has portrayed a villain, Die Hard and Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves, and he continues to shine in this one. The way he bites out his lines is phenomenal."
3,disappointed the closed captioning did NOT include English. What's up with that. It had Spanish and French..duh.,"I think the description listed closed captioning, but this DVD didn't have English. I had to sell this since I am hearing impaired. I have this problem with some rentals, but not with a regular DVD."
5,Price makes the movie even better,We love this movie and have been looking around for a bargain. The price and the quick service make for a great experience
2,"Favorite Movie, but Blu Ray With Bad Audio...","I waited and waited for Quigley to come out on Blu Ray and finally it was available by way of Walmart, but purchased through Amazon. What a SCAM! I received the long awaited item and the video quality was not great, but certainly good, and given the beautiful scenery in the movie we all enjoyed the video portion immensely. My big disapointment was with the audio when I discovered that there was no surround sound on the blu ray. What you get is stereo like the old VHS tapes! I'm sure you'll hear that it's really good stereo, but it's stereo nonetheless. I was shocked since I don't even remember buying a DVD without at least 5.1 surround, much less a blu ray. That's my gripe and now I'm in the market for the real fully functional blu ray of Quigley when it comes out. Also, shame on the studio for allowing Walmart to do this to a great movie and shame on Amazon for not posting a warning."
4,Tom Selleck at his best.,"If you are a Tom Selleck fan you can't go wrong with this Western classic. Tom portrays Matthew Quigley, a dignified gunslinger who has grown weary of his sharpshooter reputation. While the plot is fairly simple it is rewarding to see Quigley do the right thing without a second thought. Such a charismatic role for Selleck. A good film for the entire family, as long as the kids are over 9 or 10."
5,Tom Selleck Movie,This is one of my favorite movies. Tom Selleck plays Matthew Quigley as the quintessential American cowboy who takes a sharpshooter's job down under in Australia for a land baron (Alan Rickman). Not only does he fight the bad guys but he shows his compassionate side as well when he falls for Crazy Cora. Alan Rickman is a very good bad guy! A thoroughly entertaining movie with great scenery - they don't make 'em like this anymore!
5,Lots of sound,"I replaced my 5.1 Bose Lifestyle system with this speaker for the center channel & 6 Mirage Nano satellites for the surround. Unbelievable sound, Bose doesn't hold a candle to these speakers & they're a reasonable price. When combined with a Denon receiver the sound is crisp & clear."
2,"Dissapointed, incomplete",This book has the sam old stuff from other books. There are little to no real tips and limited examples. It wordy and just not worth the trouble.
2,Dated,"This book was written before digital photography became mainstream. It reads like an art book (dull) rather than a photography book. In my opinion, there are many books and websites that contain more useful and up-to-date information."
3,A good introduction,"This forms a very good introduction to the kind of things you need to think about while composing a photograph. It covers things like the emotional impact of different types of lines, shapes, colours, placements within the frame, and the like.Unfortunately, it doesn't go into very much detail. It could have gone into more detail about how different compositional elements interact, or the like. In many case it says little more than ""here's a design factor you'll want to think about"", but doesn't explain in any detail how your choices will affect the impact of the final image.Overall, an excellent book to begin with, bugt a little weak on the advanced topics."
2,A boring book,"Got this book by the recommendation of Ken Rockwell on his website.Though the book provides somewhat useful information, I'm disappointed about it because:1. It's very boring. It's more like a text book. In my opinion, a book about an inspirational subject like photography should be inspiring to read. (compared to Understanding Exposure by Bryan Peterson, for instance)2. Most of the illustrations are ugly. I don't know if the author just threw the pictures in it to make the points or I just can't understand the greatness of those pictures. But in my opinion, they are ugly. Therefore, I can hardly picture myself following the points the author's making because I don't want my photos to look like the ones illustrated in the book."
4,Dated,"Being more than 20 years old, this book is dated. However, since it is on composition you would not go wrong buying it. Still I would recommend that you buy some of the other books.I just bought my first DSLR camera. I bought ten photography books on amazon. I'm evaluating these books from the perspective of a semi-advanced amateur. (On things I've learnt is that book by the same author tends to be very similar. So make sure you vary your authors when buying more than one book. Rather than saying this author is good, let me buy more from him/her.)"
4,"Strong on Design Hints & Tech Data, But Some Photos Weak","As an intermediate amateur photographer, I compared this book with ""Learning to See Creatively"" by Bryan Peterson and ""Photography and the Art of Seeing"" by Freeman Patterson. I found chapter 2 on graphic controls (e.g., lines, shapes, patterns) quite valuable and not covered in much detail in the other two books. For example, the discussion of ""lines and their meanings"" on p.31 is thought-provoking. The technical data (e.g., camera, lens, exposure, film, and darkroom techniques) on pp.137-141 were also useful. I agree with the July 30, 2000 review that the text is ""meaningful"" but disagree that it is ""limited""; I thought there was exactly the right amount of text. Unfortunately, some of Grill's photos were unremarkable (e.g., pp.48 & 87) or borderline ugly (e.g., p.92). Hey, buy all three books at Amazon.com!"
4,"Thorough and practical, yet somewhat random","I teach 6th grade language arts, and this book is a great companion for any poetry unit. It includes many poetry elements, from onomatopoeias to alliteration, and many of the lessons bring some new ideas about how to best help students develop an appreciation of poetry. This can be a challenge, but this book does offer ways to help develop the student's ability to play with words while using their own creativity. My only complaint would be the layout and order of the lessons, because I feel that they are somewhat random."
5,Great as always.,"Este album tiene mucho ritmo, como solamente Sonido Mazter lo puede hacer. Es uno de los mejores CD's que he escuchado."
3,"Great Principles, Use Caution....",Building Christian Character is a very good resource for parents and christian educators alike. Yet caution must be taken concerning the writer's sect and their belief system.
3,Alpha Video Gem,"If like me, you are a fan of older movies, you will want to add this one to your collection. Lawrence Payne and Dermot Walsh star in this interesting (though somewhat loose) adaptation of the Poe Classic.A shy librarian falls in love with a nieghbor who prefers the attentions of another. Edgar murders his rival then hids the remains under the floor boards of his apartment. Its the perfect crime until Edgar starts to hear the beating of his victims... well, you know the rest.Alpha Video offers many older titles that are difficult to find. Unfortunately, the sound and picture quality leave much to be desired."
2,TELL TALE HEART,"Fair Quality Item. The film print used for the DVD transfer was only fair and had several negative splices, dust and particles visible. Sound Track fair. We own a Super 8 sound print of this title that is in better shape and complete without cuts."
1,BAD!!,The printing of this book is all missaligned. Pages look like they were copied on a copier and left alone. This book is a missprint and sold for $5.00 less. Almost unreadable for someone who works for a living. Getting madder while I'm writing this...
2,Frustrating Typos in Kindle Version,"While the book itself is proving to be an interesting read for anyone wanting a confederate view point of the Civil War, I am highly disappointed with the Kindle version of this book. Yes it was cheap, but that doesn't give an excuse for multiple typing errors. I've never had this problem with a Kindle version of a publication. It has gotten to the point where I feel I need to double check everyone's names as they have gotten R.E. Lee wrong at least twice, typing it as B.E. Lee. Did the publisher formatting this even check to make sure it was typed correctly? For the most part, things are okay, but there are enough typos for me to notice and it is becoming distracting from the actual work itself, which defeats the point of reading it. But where is the quality control from the publisher?"
4,Valuable contribution to understanding Gettysburg,"and much else. However I found Longstreet's style dry bordering on the mind-numbing. That said, I have always been in the camp that didn't hold Longstreet to blame for the problems of the second and even the third day at Gettysburg. Lee delegated too much authority and seemed lazy during those few crucial days to survey the ground (if he had I believe he would have concured with JL). Also Gettysburg was one of those times when a great army had a few bad days starting with the location of the battle, the quality of the ANV commanders first on the scene (poor), lack of intelligence, overconfidence etc... If JL had been in Ewell's position on the first day there wouldn't have been a second or a third day. Finally, if JL had been allowed to take over for the disaster that was Braxton Bragg, the battle for Tennesse may have ended very differently."
2,Some garbled text,"This edition has a nice photo of Longstreet, but early garbled text lead me to switch to a typo free edition, which was also cost free! I retained this edition as a back up, but the free edition has given me no cause to re-open this one."
5,great book,The third in the series. Enjoyed it as much as the other four. Would recommend all five books to anyone.
2,Home at Last,"Mari O'Malley left her small town home to make a life for herself in the big city, but all her grand plans amount to dust in the wind. So, when her mother's health fails, she takes that excuse to come back home. There, amid the family crisis, she finds her past, notably No-Account Andy, the local bad boy who has used his own past to help others avoid his mistakes. Now helping troubled teens, he's succeeded in becoming someone worthwhile. He also is firmly entrenched in Cordelia, Missouri, the last place Mari wants to spend her life. Andy's past should make him forgiving, but can he forgive Mari's mistakes? Moreover, which dreams will Mari chose to live?** Unfortunately, this series ends on a weaker note than it began. A pall of depression lingers throughout thanks to the all too accurate portrayal of the mother's health. **Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."
4,Probably as good as I remember,I read the Perry Mason books when I was a girl - a very long time ago - and loved them. When I saw they were available for my Kindle I had to try one and see if I would still enjoy them. I do. The stories are tight and the clues are available to all. In this book I was a few pages ahead of the story but not more than a few pages. The story fit together - and I enjoyed the happy ending. I'm going to be reading some more of the series.
1,Not worth the money,"This course is 30 years old, one tape was totally blank, all tapes use only half the space on the tape so really it is only about seven tapes, one side of one tape was virtually inaudible. Look at other programs than this one."
4,Flowing Tempi,"Managed to track down a copy of this CD in the USA.Tan chooses flowing tempi for concerto 9, which I like.Movement timings are 9.36/8.46/9.33.Andreas Staier and Cantus Koln are technically more polished, but the tempi are rather laboured."
4,"Thanks, Pandora","This is an artist that I hadn't heard of until his music popped up on one of my Pandora channels. ""Upstairs"" is one of my favorite songs of 2006...too bad I didn't hear it until 2009."
1,"Great series, hamstrung by lousy packaging.",This was a replacement box for a previous one that had damage to the same disk (4 of 6).The package uses weak plastic clips to hold the disks in place and they just do not workand the disks slip around.The end result is deep scratches that causes failure in operation. And it is not as if theseller did not know this; look at the other feedback for this product.
2,A cinematograpic explosion of the worst kind.,"This film was just plain noisy with overdone cinematography. Flash here, there, stop, go, slow down, speed up, insert a loud obnoxious noise, quick everyone talk at once -- it goes on for over two hours. The shot of Pacino in tears on a split screen with a football would have been laughable had it not been so pathetic. They funny thing is that if they had just stuck with the script it might have been mildly interesting to watch - the cast and acting was good, at least what you could see in the seconds before the ""tilt-a-whirl"" started up at full speed again."
3,Pretty good,"Although I am not a big fan of team sports, I basically enjoyed this film despite its flaws. The film was marred by the quirky/jerky camera technique and it was a little too long--157 minutes. Cameron Diaz turns in a good performance as the team owner and I like Pacino as an actor pretty much no matter what he does on screen. But the thing I noticed most about the movie while I was watching it was the sound track with all the clattering, thudding, and crashing noises the players made as they ran into each other during the plays, which is basically what football players do best, so at least Stone got that part right."
2,"Boring, and about an hour too long","Saw this movie last night on video. Very disappointed overall with the entire movie. Although Al Pacino was very good (when is he not?) and Jamie Foxx and Cameron Diaz were also good, the movie itself sucked. Oliver Stone has lost it. Besides making one of the most mediocre movies I've seen in a long time, he also gratuitously forced himself into several scenes, and he even put himself on the wall of a restaurant as a caricature, next to Al Pacino's. Oliver gives ""ego"" a new meaning! He needs to take a leaf from Alfred Hitchcock's notebook on how to maintain greatness. Not to mention that this movie was WAYYYYYY too long! Cut about half of the movie out (including ALL scenes with Mr. Stone) and a watchable movie could be there though that is also questionable."
4,Great,"Al Pacino delivers in this action/drama about football. It shows how much a man loves football and the greatness it takes to be a player and a coatch. To make the fire flicker Olver Stone gets a huge cast of blockbuster names such as Cameron Diaz, James Woods, Dennis Quad, and Jamie Foxx. Very good movie."
3,A little Disappointed,"This movie started out slowly. Well, actually it started out too quickly with just too many flash cuts of football scenes and players partying.Eventually it settled down into a film that we actually enjoy watching. The colors and action is great and a story line even somehow developed. The cameos were fun.LOTS of swearing and some nudity though so not for the faint of heart.Oliver Stone paints everyone with too wide a brush and the characters almost seem like cartoons.Make sure you watch the whole film to catch the end after some of the credits have rolled."
3,Any Given Sunday,"Can an extremely realistic portrayal of a football game, directed by no less an icon than Oliver Stone, ever match the sheer joy of an actual NFL game? No. Does it matter? No. Is the total lack of subtlety in Oliver Stone's work appropriate for a football movie? Of course. Damn fine movie. Real. The celebrity life of the pro football player isn't real. That's here, too. Why am I such an obsessed sports fan? I still don't know. But I do know this is a very cool movie. My lovely Australian non-sporty wife found it educational, but not gripping enough to watch all 150 minutes. She stopped at 90. But I think she'll agree with me when I recommend it. It's a good movie, with especially fine performances by Al Pacino (of course) and Jamie Foxx. Plus, many NFL stars for those of us who would notice that sort of thing."
3,"A good movie, yes. A good football movie?","Not really. By way of comparison, North Dallas Forty, was better. I did like it more than some of my football fan friends. Why? Al Pacino. He's doing his same old Shtick. But I like it. Jeff Reynolds is correct. It is worth a rental"
3,Director's Cut,"In the Director's Cut, the audio is horrible, the movie is just too long, and there is unnecessary footage put in. If you stick to the normal theatrical release you'll be fine and it makes a great movie for a football fan, but even if you don't love football, it's one movie taking 2 hours of your life to just sit down and watch."
2,Waste of Talent,"This film had a few interesting moments, but in the end it was nothing but a raunchy, loud, sensory assault. After the first half of the movie, I'd had enough. It was unwatchable after that."
3,GOOD BUT NOT EXCEPTIONAL,"It seems to me that Stone intended to make a full frontal assault against professional football, but hit the brakes early, thinking a little bit about commercial success or fear or retaliation. The result was a movie trying to show the ""truth"" about football ( only money counts, athletes playing injured, evil doctors, arrogant stars, etc, etc )and mescling it with the ""tradition"" of the game ( a game of men, of gladiators, the best Sunday entertainment you can have, etc). All in all, a good distraction."
3,Ahem Phlegm,"This could of been a better movie. Yes its pure visual at times and they were great, I suppose this is what its really like! Yet I felt a little empty, maybe it was the hunger. I think it would better to see on the big screen than a 13"". But whatever. IF you are worldly person I am sure you will like this."
3,"Never Dull, Great Cast","You could say Oliver Stone over-directed this hyper movie but you can't say it's boring. At over 2 1/2 hours it never slows down, and there's a really good cast including Pacino, Cameron Diaz, Jamie Foxx, Ann-Margaret, and James Woods. You won't learn anything new about behind the scenes of pro football, but it's worth a rental."
3,Pretty Good but way too Long,this Film has some good solid moments but overall it's way too Long.Interestingly Oliver Stone a Genius at Finding things Wrong within a Picture Never Stirs up any Issues here.most of The Acting is Overrated.the Football Scenes are cool.the film never really ever taps into any kind of Issue for any Length of time which is surprising considering How Long the film is.should have been a Better film.but still it has it's trip out Moments Especially with Jamie Foxx&LL.CooL J.you can feel the tension Sadly it has Continued off The Screen.
2,Bad quality streaming,"Watched this movie streaming, but it skipped throughout the entire movie; was not due to connection, everything else worked fine."
3,As expected....,"We did not expect it to be VHS as when we ordered, we didn't pay attention but you MUST have a VCR to play this type of media."
2,"OK, but not great","I can't put my finger on why, but I didn't really care for this movie (and I usually like all kinds). The game sequences seemed like they were taken from ESPN's ""Best Of"" compilations. And Al Pacino (as great as he is) was unconvincing as a professional football coach. You didn't really see him as a coach character, but as ""Al Pacino.""There were some decent performances from some big-name actors, but the foul language overshadowed much of the enjoyment that could have been had from watching a good sports film. It is simply unnecessary."
2,Bland movie with unlikeable characters,"Is it a rule that Oliver Stone can't make a movie under 4 hours? Or maybe it just seemed that way as I labored through this one. The major problem is the character development. Dennis Quaid is injured within five minutes and, I guess, we want him to return to his dominant form-though we are only going on what they tell us. Enter the 3rd string guy-and he starts to shine. His character is unlikeable and that never changes. So when Quaid comes back-you don't want either of them to play. There was nothing to keep this football fan intrigued.If you want a real football movie-see Rudy.I've said it before and I will say it again. LL Cool J = Box Office Poison."
1,Not so entertaining for white men,"I was really curious to see this film because i saw some previous Stone's movies wich i liked and also because i like a lot sport movies, i'm thinking of Tin Cup and Bull Durham. But when i saw this film i was disapointed. Is this what really happens in the world of football white men being discriminated. What a great sport!! I don't know for u guys but is quite embarracing to take your girl to a film like that. And i'm not an anglo-saxon i'm portuguese so it's diferent to me.That's what i think of this film anyway i'm curious for what u can say."
4,Eye poppin excitement,Al Pacino and Cameron Diaz are great and so is Jamie Foxx. The football player losing his eye in slow motion is one that will stick in you'r mind. It is symbolic of the America's occupation with the well being of the stars while the lineman are the anomonous pawns who grit it out in the trenches.
2,It's a music video... not a film.,"To me it's hard to believe that this simple and obvious film was endorsed by the master Oliver Stone himself. The film is not worthy of his reputation.And don't stone me but Al Pacino is not the image of football coach. They have a certain personna and presence that Pacino just didn't embody in this film. Nor did any of the great NFL legends who appeared. Come on... Johnny Unitas as a coach. Please. He, Jim Brown, LT (who actually was perfect for this film), and Dick Butkus just didn't fit the mold. Are they all worthy of adoration certainly but from the film's perspective they were out of place.The characters aren't sufficiently developed and the intensity is lacking not to mention the fact that the pace of the film and particular scenes moved entirely to rapidly. Too many images in too short of a period of time.A disappointing effort."
2,The cast was all wrong for this movie.,"I picked up this movie knowing that during the shooting they had problems getting the talent they wanted...I just didn't think that it would show this badly in the finished product. Pacino was good, but not great...too bad since I'm a big Pacino fan. Cameron Diaz was a waste in this movie... As for the rest they aren't worth mentioning.Unless you're a serious fan of football I wouldn't recommend this movie...It has it's moments, but so does a visit to the dentist...I do give it 2 stars however due to the fact that the directing was excellent, and the cinematography was very well done... Oliver Stone did the best he could do with this movie, but he should stick to what he's good at."
3,"Entertaining film, nothing else","With cliches and all, this film is better than the overated Gladiator, movie that I don{t see how it could win the Oscar. AnNd I say this seriously. I thought that the movie Gladiator had a poor script, and as much as cliches -and maybe even more- than this one. Im not saying that these two movies are similar, but they do relay on the pumped-up macho thing... battles in the field, and on the arena, etc. The reason why Gladiator won an Oscar it was because it was a historical epic, set in the Rman Empire, so that impresses people. But the movie was much poorer, flawed, brainless and less entertaining than this Oliver Stone's OK film."
2,Awful,"This movie is one big, loud contrivance. Badly written, and shot with quick cuts like a TV commericial or music video. And Al Pacino gives another yell-every-line-like-a-deaf-man performance. What happened to the subtle acting of his early career? The only reason I'm not giving it only one star is Cameron Diaz is lovely to look at, and Dennis Quaid in fact does a first-rate acting job in his role, and Jamie Foxx acts well, too. But everything else about the movie is as bad as it gets."
5,Any Given Sunday,"When a devastating hit knocks a professional football legend and quarterback Cap Rooney out of the game, a young, unknown third-stringer is called in to replace him. Having ridden the bench for years because of a string of bad luck stories and perhaps insufficient character, Willie Beaman seizes what may be his last chance, and lights up the field with a raw display of athletic prowess. His stunning performance over several games is so outstanding and fresh it seems to augur a new era in the history of this Miami franchise, and forces aging coach Tony D'Amato to reevaluate his time-tested values and strategies and begin to confront the fact that the game, as well as post-modern life may be passing him by. Wild and outrageous, Any Given Sunday gives you a glimpses into an athletic world not too far from the real thing. This movie proved to be a very enjoyable experience."
3,"DRUGS, SEX AND NO ROCK'N ROLL","1999. Co-written and directed by Oliver Stone. Hysterical editing for this football movie. Drugs, sex and no rock and roll. Avoidable if you're not a fan of the American favorite sunday entertainment."
5,"""Any Given Sunday"" is the best sports film since...never!","""Any Given Sunday"", starring Al Pacino and Cameron Diaz, directed by Oliver Stone, is possibly THE best sports film EVER! The film follows a football team, losing, that discovers its star football player through getting one injured. Much of the film is in the background of the players' lives between games, but the football games are perhaps the most exciting I've ever seen! I prefer this movie to ANYONE!"
2,Oliver Stone meets football. Not a good sign...,"First, I am not what you'd consider a fan of Oliver Stone, although Wall Street remains my favorite movie of all time. This movie was a big disappointment to me. I expected so much more, especially with Al Pacino. The story line seemed to drag on and on, although nothing like JFK :-)If you want a good football movie, I'd recommend The Longest Yard, The Program, The Repalcements, even The Waterboy over this one. The audio (DVD 5.1 channel) is great, but that's where the highpoints end."
1,"[junk]. Pure, unadulterated [junk].","If you've ever wanted to see a football movie made by a guy who's never watched a football game, here's your chance.Oliver Stone runs through every tired pro-athlete cliche while never giving us a story that's worth any more than a Movie of The Week on your local network affiliate... The only bright spot is Jamie Foxx, in a role that lets him run around as an egotistical football player. Even Pacino looks forced, like he's phoning in his lines from Hawaii while CGI artists create a polygon Al for the screen.Are you a football fan? See Brian's Song instead, a TV movie with better direction and screenplay than this steaming pile of offal.Are you a film fan? Go earn yourself some Terry Gilliam, a better director than Stone will ever be, even in his most feverish wet dreams..."
2,Why?,"This movie was awful. My question is why? Why did Oliver Stone make this film? It was not good, not interesting, and not appealing.I did NOT enjoy the cinematography. It was out of place, obnoxious, and completely irritating. I remember one scene with Lauren Holly and Denis Quaid that started off promising, but then shot to a smaller screen so that some crap could be shown, too. It hacked me off. The two stars are for the decent preformances. Pretty much the whole cast was good. Although James Woods and Cameron Diaz were not at their best. They still did the job. However, they did not help the movie come out positive."
5,great movie,"I originally got this movie because of the football. I am a huge football fan. This movie was great from start to finish. The football was excellent along with the acting. Do not listen to any bad reviews about this movie. After about thirty minutes into the movie I forgot the whole reason I got it, which was cause of the football. I really got involved in the movie because they made you wonder what would happen next with constant team fighting and quarterback contraversies among many other things. This was great in all aspects of the movie."
2,Every cliche in the playbook -- plus a lousy sound mix...,"I generally like Oliver Stone's films, but this was an exception. A loud, dumb, blunderbuss of a movie, it has some decent performances, but a by-the-numbers script. Why does the climax of every sports movie have to come down to the last few seconds/last out/last hole/last whatever? It's the nature of the beast, but it sure does make for predictability. And the tie-it-all-up ending could have come from a 30s Warner Brothers sports biography.Something that was even more annoying than the seen-it-before plot was the sound mix. Stone seemed to be so enamored of his soundtrack music and ambient noise that he let it ride right over much of the dialogue. I finally turned on the English subtitles, and learned that I hadn't been missing much.Rabid football fans might enjoy this melodramatic look behind the scenes, but others should give it a pass."
2,Pretty Disappointing,"ANY GIVEN SUNDAY was overlong, at times annoying, and had a disposable script. There was absolutely no need for this movie to drag on for almost three hours. If you're looking forward to the football playing scenes, be prepared to be vexed and disoriented. Stone obviously tried to stage the football scenes in a unique way, and there's nothing wrong with that, but his method just didn't work, at many times giving you just very bad views of the action on the field. Not all that is different is good. The plot was nothing too interesting or original either. There are many better football films out there."
5,"AL PACINO , football","Great movie. a little graphic on sexuality but love team spirit. Best part is when they are carrying lawrence taylor offthe field and he smiles and says "" BE CAREFULL , DON'T DROP ME , I'M A MILLION DOLLAR MAN ""."
5,A big-time classic!,"The first two times I saw this movie, I didn't really think much of it. But when I saw it the third time, I really enjoyed it and thought to myself this could be the number one movie in my top 100. This should have gotten Oscar consideration. Al Pacino and Jamie Foxx carried this movie. Most of the movies that were up for Oscar consideration in recent years were nothing but long, dry-ass movies to quote Steve Harvey. If you want a movie that dispalys great acting and is very entertaining, then Any Given Sunday is it for you."
5,One of my favorite football films,Any Given Sunday is a film that everyone love if you're a football fan or not. Oliver Stone direction of the games and actors is some of the best since North Dallas Forty. The cinematography by Andrezj Bartchowizk is very good also. Al Pacnio as the coach and Cameronz Diaz as the team owner both gave oscar worthy performances as do Jamoe Foxx and LL Cool as the quarter back and wide receiver.
2,"Misdirected, pointless, disconnected, unbelievable",The eye thing was one of the dumbest things I've even seen in any movie trying to take itself seriously.
1,Junk,"One big music video. Quick cuts for the person with mush for an attention span. Junk writing. Junk direction. And Al Pacino gives another one of his ""yell every line"" performances. What happened to the Pacino of the GODFATHER days, who knew what ""subtlety"" meant? Stone NEVER knew what subtlety meant!"
2,Just ok,"I had high expectations for this movie and I love sports so usually I'll let some things slide. With that being said, this movie really wasn't worth it. It had some good action and an OK story line, but the acting on average was poor even some of the stars (Diaz) blew it. The story goes like this, head coach Tony D'amato's (Pacino) team is on a big losing streak. His quarterback (Qauid) due to an injured is replaced by the talented but ego-centric Willie Beaman (Foxx), who only cares about himself and has no thought for ""TEAM"". Now the head coach has got to battle with his new quarterback, the greedy team owner (Diaz) and on top of everything else, a team doctor who puts injured players on the field despite the risks of permanant injuries. Too much off the field sequences and a weak story. It just wasn't good enough and I can't recommend this movie."
5,Any Given Sunday,Very good film. I waa required to review it for a college course that I was taken and it really assisted me with getting the information that I needed.
1,What were you watching?,"I see some of the favorable reviews of this movie and really wonder what movie were you watching? I was able to endure an hour of this movie in the theater and had to walk out. Of course, that leaves an opportunity that the second have of this movie to make up for the first hour, but there was simply too much ground to make up. I rank this in the same category as Speed 2 on the all time worst list. By the way, I realy like football, Al Pacino, and Cameron Diaz, but hated this movie."
1,I'm going to be shortwinded....,"This movie is baaaaaaaad. Oliver Stone should be ashamed of himself. The casting on this thing is just horrible and half of the characters don't fit their roles. The acting is far short of superb and the script is all over the place. There are some past stories we don't know about and aren't being told. It's just entirely too confusing and very very very highly irritating. The movie drags and is wayyy too long, around 3 hours. That and a gratutious male shower scene that disgusted me get this horrid movie the stamp of ""garbage""you may say my review wasn't helpful to you but i guarantee it has helped you in keeping away from this junk"
4,For my eyes,"Of course it takes more than one bottle of medication to see whether it works or not but, it appears to do what it was supposed to do. My eyes feel better but will wait to finish the bottle to make any final remarks on the product."
4,Goats are cool,"Out of curiosity, I bought this book. The first time I tried to read it, it bored me and I gave up. A year or so later, I decided to try again. I understood the events better, and I couldn't put it down. Adversity bonded two teens who were total strangers to each other. I've never been tricked as Laura and Howie were, but I'm a loner and I also formed close friendships with other lone wolves. The details of the boy and the girl's flight away from camp were intriguing. But why is this book rated for ages 9-12? There are a few mentions of adult movies, nudity, and centerfolds, as another reviewer said. While these references aren't pornographic, they are still inappropriate for preteens. Only high school students and older should read ""The Goats"". Overall, it's a great book which I'd reccomend to most young adults."
5,The Coming of Age Story,"I read this book when I was 11 years old and I am now 21. I enjoyed every bit so much that I know it word for word. I think the book is excellent for the mature young reader because it captures some issues that most adults would be able to relate to only through metaphors. This promising book includes puberty issues, isolation issues, and issues of social and moral growth. This book is still one of my favorites and I recommend it to any young adult that has ever had to face dilemmas at a very young age. I challenge the young reader to find their similarities and differences between the Bryce (main character) and his companion with themself."
4,Realistic Play Fruits,"This is a great product to use to teach children to label fruits. I was having a hard time finding this product and these are great and exactly what I needed. Durable, colorful and realistic."
1,Very slow order & shipping & outrageous shipping charges,"I ordered 20 of these cables at $1.38 on the 25th of November. They arrived to me on the 8th of December. The shipping charge was almost $20 and not overnight or priority or anything. 20 3 ft cables is a pretty light box. FedEx has a $5.99 box this could have been in and at my office in 3 days. Instead, the shipping was WAY OUT OF LINE as to what is generally acceptable and then here long past when I needed the cables. Amazon should be careful as to what companies it allows as part of its family. mz"
4,Hotch hype and hubris,"In his Preface, Hotchner writes:""I was young and struggling and vulnerable."" What these Letters reveal is that ""Hotch"" was ambitious, greedy and manipulative. Just read the exchange concerning the ""True"" article (pp 172-179).Though De Fazio and the University of Missouri Press are to be congratulated for their Herculean accomplishment, those familiar with other Hemingway letters/memorabilia and scholarship, published and unpublished, know why Hotchner ""had fallen out of favor with Mary""(Preface 12), as well as with other family members, true friends and many Hemingway scholars. Conrad Aiken, who early on saw Hemingway's genius, wrote, on the occasion of T.S.Eliot's death 40 years ago, ""that this is the age of the ex-wife and the editor.""I would add a third category: the ""so-called friend."""
1,Phantom of The Opera won't play in any player,"This review in not for the movies which I consider them to be great. This review is for the product itself: I bought an used set in Amazon and the phantom of the Opera won't play in any of my HD DVD players HD-A20 HD-A30 and HD-D2. The Fugitive had pixel problems in all players and the same happened to the unforgiven. the only movie that was OK was The Last Samurai. Then I decided to buy a set that was new, thinking that the reason why the previous one, wouldn't play was because it was used and therefore somehow damaged. Well to my surprise the brand new one had exactly the same problem. therefore I don't recommend this set to any one. By the way all of the players have the latest 4.0 firmware update, so the players should not be the issue."
1,Does it actually exist in BluRay? }B^),"I ordered this set, and received an HD version. I contacted Amazon about the error, and they ordered a replacement. It came very quickly, but was again an HD version of the set. I again contacted Amazon, this time they gave me a refund, figuring the same thing would happen again. Maybe the 3rd one's the charm?"
2,The Fugitive with bad HD presentation,"I did not view the other product yet, but I watched the Fugitive. Man just like a Standard DVD. For sure not meet the Blu-Ray expectation!!"
5,Love it!,"Received the cd, Family Tradition, The Stoneman Legacy, quickly and in good condition. Some of the music takes me back to when my father used to play these old songs on his banjo and guitar. Really enjoy the old folk songs!"
1,Frustrated beyond belief,"I have tried about a dozen times to get this program to work on my computer without any success. I have telephoned the folks at Activision twice and gone on line to make sure I have the correct minimum requirements on my computer for this game. We have several other computer games with graphics that work quite well, but all we get on this one is a black screen. The folks at Activision finally told us we could send the game back, not for a refund, but for an ""exchange"". Not interested. If we had this much trouble with HOTD, we don't want to risk anything else."
5,Masterpiece of Sci-fi cinema,One of the best sequels of all time and one of the best science fiction movies ever made. James Cameron can make a damn fine movie when he wants.
2,Does NOT have CFA 2008 Learning Objectives,"It may be good for beginners to understand the concepts, but it is a waste of your money if you are taking the exam for 2008. Although some may consider not a big deal, one disturbing thing I found was that the formulas use a different notations/symbols/terminology than what you will find in CFA Institute books. So you are likely to go back and forth between notations and get confused. It is better to stick to CFA Institute notations as questions in the exam will use the terminology from their book.You will also be surprised to know that this book does not cover 2008 CFA Learning Objectives."
3,"Good tunes, working musicians!","Nothing fancy here, but solid muscianship and great tune selection. The track ""I'll Never Stop Loving You"" alone is worth the purchase price. Buy this album that supports this hard working club musician."
5,For anyone contemplating embarking upon a teaching career,"Collaboratively compiled and edited by Alysia D. Roehrig, Michael Pressley, and Denise A. Talotta, Stories Of Beginning Teachers: First-Year Challenges And Beyond is an informed and informative survey and description of the unique and manifold challenges new classroom teachers face, replete with anecdotes from teachers during their first year on the job, including memorable encounters, students, and tasks. A highly accessible look at the especial travails of one of the most important occupations concerning the future of humankind, Stories Of Beginning Teachers is especially commended reading for anyone contemplating embarking upon a teaching career."
3,Decent,"This is a pretty good little book...and it really is a little book. It's about 4 inches tall. But it does give some good information, and the pictures are adorable!"
2,"All weight, no substance","I bought these headphones to go with my brand new ipod nano, and i must say I was quite disappointed. I bought the pair as they were the best looking (and highest priced) Nike brand headphones. I was let down by how insufficient the bass was on these. My cell phone speaker has better bass! I was excited to run with these until I heard the lackluster sound quality. I don't think the weight of these headphones would've made it too comfortable... these puppies are HEAVY. On top of that, the shape of the actual buds didn't create a good enough seal to drown out any of the surrounding noise even at a sufficient volume. Forget about losing yourself in your workout at the gym with these on. To summarize, I liked how these look and that's about it. No bass and too heavy. Avoid and go with another pair."
4,Outstanding very comfortable Good sound,I do not give them Great sound because the speakers are like 1/4 inch in sizeand you just can not get great sound from someting that small at this price. I am lucky to have an EQ in my MP3 player ( Creative Zen )so I did not have the Bass problem mentioned by some one elseThese are by far the most comfortable headphones of this style I have ever used and sound almost as good as my Sony MDR-V150 head phones but not as good as my large Koss phones I am very happy with them
2,"Great For Small Ears, During Their Short Lifespan","Purchased from Target for a little less than $50. I have tried almost all the headphones for working out and running for over the ear but none seemed to fit my small ears until now. These were great. Working out and running, they never fell out. Having the cord on the outside of my shirt, and using a machine that I had to make contact with the pad, it pulled the cord apart. I returned them to Target and got another pair. I had to return two more sets because the left speaker busted. Now that my return is out of date, my fourth pair busted on the left side again. There will NOT be a fifth pair."
1,Not for runners,"I would give them 0 stars of that was an option. I am a serious runner and marathoner. I decided to splurge for the more expensive ""sweat resistant"" Skylon metal headphones. The first pair broke in less than a week. I bought a second pair. I wish they would break as well. Their weight makes them unusable for any rigorous workout. They might be ok if you jog slowly or walk, but not if you run. don't waste the money. Nike can (and should) do better."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought these for running, thinking that the adjustable clip would help them to stay on my ears. They do not adjust small enough to really hold onto my ears. The weight makes them move around on your ear...or rather they don't move with the wearer. The result is they fall off frequently. I also agree that the sound quality is sub-par.I wish I could send them back, but bought off eBay, no returns. Just glad I didn't spend $50 on mine."
2,not the best,"I've seen better books that offer help in this area, but for the price I paid, it was still worth it. My kids can use it to gain some insight. It is very easy reading, too."
3,This cd is about middle of the road,"After reading the other reviews I feel like I should add my two cents.If this is the best cd, the most perfect cd, then I would hate to hear what you would call a bad cd. Is there such a thing as a bad cd? Most people talk about the best cds only. Is there a flip side to this issue?This cd offered a good song list, but left a lot to be desired else where."
1,Too Small,"Ordered mens 6.5 for my son, shoes are sized a womans 6.5 (say mens 6.5 on box and shoe). I'm going to have to pay $6.50 to return them for a larger size. Don't waste your money, Buy NIkes!"
5,wow! elegant performances,"Who is this guy? He plays with grace, intelligence, maturity, sensitivity and elan... I love when you discover a great artist. He's been great for some time. You're the one who has been in the dark. Well, do these performances hold up to the inevitable comparison with de Larrocha? Yup... Are they better? No -- but on the same plain -- just different -- certainly intriguing, thoughtful performances that deserve to be heard. And the recorded sound quality is excellent. This is pianism on the level that other pianists take notice of. I hope I can hear more of him. Lucky people at Michigan State who have him as an artist in residence."
4,So cute but way too small,"I loved these shoes, I just wish I could wear them. My mother in law was able to wear these and she wears a size 8 and I ordered size 11! Order at least 2 sizes bigger"
1,Item never arrived,"This item was ordered, but the vendor sent an email saying it was unavailable a month later. No explanation was given except: Item: Study Guide to accompany Chemistry: Matter and Its Changes, 4th EditionQuantity: 1ASIN: 0471215198Reason for refund: Order cancelled by merchantVery annoying when trying to purchase a large number of back-to-school books."
2,Not worth the price,"This DVD is useful in the beginning only. Very soon it is no longer needed; therefore, it is not worth $30.00; perhaps $10.00 for a used copy, but not much more."
3,Rebel XTi,"Good book for beginners, I'm one... but I still suck taking pictures. Maybe not because the book but it's better to try to make your own mistakes than trying to wait for a book that tell you what to do...If you bought a Canon in their page they have tutorials...Good look with your shots!!!"
5,Kwaito!,"Bongo Maffin have been popular in Africa for years. Now this seminal Kwaito (from an Afrikaans word meaning ""really hot house music"") band have been given a chance to make it in the States with Bongolution, their first US release.Well, all I can say is listen to it. This multi-layered music is mind-blowing. The mix of hip-hop, jazz, and reggae--with some electronic help--is wonderful and entirely successful.Most of the songs are not in English, but don't let that turn you off. The language (usually chanted) is music in itself. ""Laduma Izulu"" is a prime example.Turn yourself on to South Africa's pop music through Bongo Maffin's Bongolution."
5,Eros Ramazzotti es simplemente el mejor,"Eros Ramazzotti es simplemente el mejor cantante italiano de todos los tiempos, con esta recopilación de exitos da muestra una vez más de su romanticismo y sentimiento. Este material en realidad vale la pena tenerlo.Eros Ramazzotti is simple the best, Tina Turner said that too :O)"
1,Disappointing for such an important course in Buddhism,"The Seven Point Mind Training is supposed to be one of the most exhilarating teaching in Buddhism, but after reading this book I was greatly disappointed and wish that the author had not chosen the name of the training as the title of this book. It is shallow compared to the seven point mind training taught by the lamas at the Kagyu Institute. If you are one of the readers who seek such a training, don't be put off by this book and continue pursuing this training. This is just like one of the many confusing work borrowing the title of Buddhist teaching and as mentioned by HH Dalai Lama, indeed Alan Wallace is a Buddhist thinker (mind you, not teacher). The book is like an essay of his thought rather than a guide from a teacher to a student. I will not recommend this book for serious Buddhists seeking mind training."
1,Concert Sound and Lighting Systems,This book contains very general information on the basic steps and equipment required for a concert. It is very basic and provides very little technical information.
3,"Good, but dated.","Overall this book gives a good overview into the field of concert lighting and sound. Much of the equipment talked about in this book is no longer in use in the field. The book does not include any talk about fiber optic cables, which are becoming a standard. I would only suggest this book to a younger reader that just wants a feel for the field."
2,Sorta sucks,"I went through this whole book and still didn't find any new ways of forcing I liked. There are only 94 ways to force, Annemann straight up tells you why he named it 201. All the forces seem pretty lame, maybe i'll use one eventually."
2,Uncomfortable toe dividers,"Very thick and plush, but definately not practical as a spa slipper. You won't be able to polish your toes before inserting because the individual spaces are tight together after the huge space from the big toe. Nor practical after inserting toes either because of the fluffiness.Also, it's design throws the foot at a weird angle. You can adjust the first toe to line it up so your foot is correct on the slipper but the individual spaces after the first toe are too far from the first toe and they throw the foot sideways off the side of the slippers. I will have to remove most of them if not all of the individual ones.Worth keeping though as comfortable flip flop slippers for the $12."
3,Funny stuff,"Much has been written about Gerry Anderson's stuff. Terrahawks has its moments, especially the later episodes, and is definitely worth a watch. The limited budget shows but the scripts are funny."
3,Underworld Story,"'Chandni Bar' exposes the common problems of big city societies, in this case, Mumbai. It is the story of underworld, prostitution, drugs, and crime. An orphaned girl becomes a dancer in Chandni Bar, eventually escapes the bar after marrying a top criminal, has two children, and the criminal/husband is killed. She goes back to the bar as a waitress-she is too old to be dancer any more-and manages to raise her children. She wants a wholesome future for them. But the son turns to crime and daughter becomes a dancer at Chandni Bar. Instead of the bright future she has dreamed for her children, all she can now see in them is her past.This film won four National Awards."
2,not what I pictured,"I expected parchment paper to be thinner, and I was a little weirded out because this paper has veins of a golden color running through it. I wanted to draw on it, but now I really don't know what to do with it because of the color variations. It's not good drawing paper. I'm not sure what you would use it for, honestly, but be advised."
2,Not as good as I thought,"I bought this manga after hearing many good things about it. But when I opened it up I was less than thrilled. The art was, well there's no other way to put it, rather ugly. I know it's a matter of opinion but manga-ka such as CLAMP and Takeuchi Naoko have far better talents. Also, there was no plot to the story. I'm not saying there has to be, but when the art is bad and the characters aren't appealing then usually the plot can make or break the story. Of course if there is none, then well I guess you have no story. It's all in your tastes, I happen to like magical girl stories such as Sailormoon, Magic Knight Rayearth, and Cardcaptor Sakura. But don't let my opinions sway you, you can only decide if you like by reading it yourself."
4,"This book starts out ok,.. but only gets better!!","This book starts out like it did in the first few mangas did,.. (the art anyway) HUGE eyes and stuff like that. But it gets better, but the artwork is even more detailed in the future books."
1,"Oh My God, this book ......","From first glance, the manga looked completely stupid (not to mention ugly), but I read it anyway because of the ""don't judge a book by its cover"" line. Well, I should have followed my instincts. Not only are the illustrations horrible, but this manga also has no plot build up. The first page starts off right in the middle of the story, and you wouldn't understand what the heck he (the main character guy; didn't even bother to remember his name) was doing unless you read the summary on the back cover. Further more, the characters' relationships are unclear. The author gives no indication to whether or not Belldandy likes the main character, but then has them kissing out of nowhere. Um, what happened to character conflicts and all that good stuff?"
3,Wish there was more...,My 18 month old loves Spot books. I got him this bath book b/c he enjoys reading in the bath as well. I was disappointed when I got the book and there was so little text inside. This book is definitely for children a year and younger.
3,"I liked it, kids didn't","The description says 8 cards, I only received 6. I wrote the company and they immediately sent me a new set... of 6. I wrote them again and they said they would check and if there is only 6 to a set they would change the description. The description still says 8 and I did not receive the other 2 cards, if there are 2 more cards. I am a pediatric occupational therapist and used this for work. For some reason, none of the kids really liked this activity, so have not used it as much as I thought I would. You can use with the game flat on the table or stand it on end. The cards are large and there is the same design printed on the backs in black and white, so you could color in the circles on the back and double the amount of cards you have."
1,Too small,"The seller didn't specify the size of this bags holder. It appears much bigger on the picture, but the real size is only 4.5"" x 7.5"". Not worth buying."
2,Plastic Bag Keeper,"I thought it would be larger. I didn't use it where I had planned, but I keep it in my bathroom for that garbage and it works perfect inside the sink door."
3,Understanding Gauguin,"This is a lovely book... and, brief though it is, helped me to understand more about Gauguin's reasons behind his actions. I read it at a perfect time - when the Metropolitan Museum of Art in NY was holding one of their most important exhibits on Gauguin and featured his wood cuts. It's a colourful, passionate and painful journey."
2,More of less.,This book continues the theme of shallowness set for me by theXericape color guide. It will helpto keep the coffee table from being empty as house guests might want to quickly leaf through them to look at illustrations of plants that actual photographs would have helped a reader see how a xeriscape might come to be in their own endevour for a xeriscape displayed in their own yard..
2,not as expected,"The book has little to do with xeriscaping; the subtitle would have made a better title. Only chapter vi is about watering & irrigation. The book isn't for those receiving little rainfall, but for those who usually have enough rain with occasional rainless periods who want to avoid watering at all. The section on soil composition was good."
1,South Pagatagonia Icefield Map far better,This map was very disappointing. It only includes the area north and west of Chalten to just west of the major peaks. We're planning on doing a circuit from Paso Marconi to Paso del Viento and this map doesn't show any of the area. Also the trekking route to L Toro is not included on the map. This map is only printed on one side so its kind of a waste of paper Far better is the South Patagonia Icefield Map which contains 6 times as much information in the same amount of space and the same scale.
2,Outdated trekking map for the El Chalten area,"I have purchased that map to plan my 6-day trek from El Chalten to De Agostini, then on to Poincenot, Piedras del Fraile (ex-Troncos) and Capri camps. The map is inaccurate in several respects: Jim Bridwell camp is now called De Agostini, the trail from Poincenot to Piedras del Fraile on the West of Rio Blanco is not mentioned, the trail to Laguna Pollone is not mentioned, the trail to Mirador Cerro Electrico is incorrectly represented, the shortcut to return from Capri to El Chalten is not shown. There's a MUCH more accurate map available in El Calafate and El Chalten called ""Chalten Trekking Map"", green cover, cost ARS $45, with all the latest trails. Contact me if you need to know more."
2,Better Than Nothing,"This map is mediocre. The data is old, the printing is so-so, and the paper quality is low. However it is definitely better than nothing."
2,So so book,"Not what I had hoped - it has lots of ""pictures"" of vintage items, but no patterns, no indication of where to buy anything similar to what they show, so not a lot of value here."
1,More Boring than Wild,"I own every other Hockey video or DVD that Amazon sells. This was the last one I brought, and by far the worst. Most of the time is spend on interview with managment, not with players. There is limited footage of players on the ice. My two sons, 7 and 10, play hockey, and love to watch hockey. I couldn't convince them to sit through this snorer. They aren't interested in interviews with middle-aged bald men!"
3,Unsure,I recieved the item on time and it was as described. I didnt really notice any difference after using this product. However I have had some medication changes and other factors like hormonal over eating.
1,worked opposite for me,"gained weight when taking this, not what I was hoping for, I took it for 3 weeks but never did drop the weight until I stopped taking it, could just be me though, I have a tendency to be opposite most people on a lot of things."
1,No impact,I see absolutley no impact in health or weight loss from this product. There is some research to suggest it may help but I don't think it's worth the money
4,Strange and Brilliant,"For the Roland Barthes fan--or any budding postmodernist--an absolute must read. Strange, often baffling, Barthes uses the ""autobiographical"" form to write what is part criticism, part poetry, part myth and part ""true story""--if its not too unpostmodern to even use the word true. The title suggests it all--Barthes becomes his text, and vice-versa. Not a beach read, for sure, but very interesting nonetheless."
4,Teacher Recommended!,"I teach kids on a K-4 level and they all love this game! Phonics, letter reconision, even ABC order. My students fight over this one. Better for younger students/children just learning to read or with a minimum reading background."
3,disney reading abc/disney math 123,"The six demo discs mentioned in a review were not sent with my order nor is there any indication that they will be coming. Also the disc appears to be the same as a previous disc I purchased entitled Disney's ready for Reading/Math. This is a great disc, but reviews and titles were deceiving which accounts for my disappointment."
4,A LOST TREASUE,"All of David Ackles albums have their share of powerful songs intermingled with some lugbriously pretentious ones. Don't let that turn you off. ""Road To Cairo"",""Down River"" & ""Be My Friend"" are Ackles at his finest. The likes of ""Blue Ribbons"" capture him at his most haunting.I suppose Ackles could best be described as a sort of melancholy cross between Randy Newman & Leonard Cohen with echoes of Kurt Weill & Sondheim thrown in. He also has a strange way of drawing you in even on his more awkward lyrical excursions like "" My Name Is Andrew"" & ""Sonny Boy Come Home"". Neither are destined to be your favorite but with repeated listens they grow on you.His other albums AMERICAN GOTHIC and SUBWAY are also highly recommended. Ackles was a terrific songwriter who went on to influence the likes of Elvis Costello & on down to the insipid likes of Phil Collins. A dreamlike malaise of bruised vocals and lonely sentiments. A must for early Leonard Cohen fans."
5,A Classic Hidden Gem,An album I listened to on long lonely nights. Every song is beautiful. I recommend this album for the unique.
3,Very simplified instruction with little emphasis on horse,"The book is all of 24 pages long. Contains lots of good pictures and diagrams of harness tack, but very little instruction on dealing with the horses reaction to it! Since the title is ""Starting to Drive"", I assumed there would be more information concerning getting the horse aquainted with the tack. This would be a good book to familarize yourself with the various harness components, however I wouldn't use it as a direction to harnessing a horse, especially a green one!"
2,Overpriced,"The content is good, short and sweet, but accurate and understandable.That being said, it was ONLY 28 pages long. That's the reason for two stars, otherwise I would give it a 4.I can buy a full length novel for 7.99. I also own many DIY books that are full of photos like this one, and only cost 4.99 - 5.99 on subjects like home wiring, etc.Do the math."
3,Starting to Drive guide #28,"This book is fairly basic. I believe it was written for about the 6th grade level. Not a lot of information, but informative."
5,Nuts,"I love nuts. Peanuts, walnuts, pistacio nuts and even these nylon thumb nuts. They're better than wing nuts but not as tasty as pecans. I love nuts."
3,"Interesting reading, but massively slanted.","Well, we are duly warned.While the information in this book is clearly well thought out and presented, the tone of the book throughout is demeaning. I couldn't make it through more than a chapter at a time without putting it down in disgust.I guess I would have to say: just the facts, please."
3,Smell is important when buying used books,"As always, the content in William Barclay's study guides to the books of the New Testament is excellent. However, when buying a used book, we need to know if it is musty or has a strong odor. This one needed lots of freshner and several days of airing before I could use it."
4,my sisters friends boots,my sister has 1 of her friends over all the time. she has these boots in the black color. lastnight my sisters friend came over and had her black boots on. when they went out she had on a pair of my sisters sneakers. i went into my sisters room to look at her friends boots. my mom walked in as i was standing up with the boots on. i walked over and showed them to my mom. my mom likes them too. i took them off and handed them to my mom.my mom pulled them both on. she told me that the boots are a perfect fit.my mom had them on for hours. i think she forgot she was wearing them. my sister and her friend came in from the movies and my mom was still wearing them. they didn't notice until my dad told my mom that he loves my moms new boots. my sister was mad at mom for wearing her friends boots. her friend did not care.
1,Pitted & rusted within 2 months!,"Within 2 months of buying Pfaltzgraff Sonya service for 8, the knives became pitted and rusted all along the blade. This flatware looks great but is poor quality - and after a couple of months is totally unusable. Stay away"
4,Achieving significance,"Linda Gramatky-Smith extends the Little Toot franchise in this 1999 imprint by Grosset & Dunlap. Instead of simulating her father's work, however, Smith and illustrator Mark Weber shade the character with their own sensibilities. Hardie Gramatky's original Toot illustrations were calligraphic and elastic; an ex-Disney artist, Gramatky's Toot slumped, glided and tugged with great emotional expressiveness. Weber's Toot, on the other hand, is more toy-like and solid; his Toot performs with his face not his body. The storylines also differ. In the original Gramatky book, Little Toot becomes a hero through ingenuity and pluck; he blows smoke signals and then overcomes his small size through sheer determination. Smith's Toot becomes heroic through cognitive facility--he is able to find his way home by remembering landmarks. In the end, both Smith's book and Gramatky's original book play to a child's desire for significance but differ in what it means to achieve it."
4,another great book for the kids,"If you like the book ""little Toot"" this one is a great follow up at story time. It seems all the books for sale must be reading books from a school classroom library, ours has random crayon marks and came with a little popcorn in it.Compared to the original ""Little Toot"" book this story is shorter.The Nubble Lighthouse in York, ME is our favorite place to visit, having a book that includes one of my children's favorite characters and the Nubble Light is awsome!"
3,Does the job,It's about time someone figured out how to label a measuring cup so that you didin't have to raise the cup or lower yourself to get the eye level measurement. This is a sturdy cup. Mine has taken multiple trips through the diswasher and the markings remain in tact.I've used the lids on my cups twice. I tend to use plastic wrap instead.
4,no problems,The red lid isn't airtight even turning the slotted ends. This is a thick glass product. I have no idea about the Oxo counterpart but I would have checked out the Oxo if the Oxo had existed when I got this. I have owned this for years and it is necessary for Nigella's choco loaf cake recipe because the recipe requires half a cup of BOILING hot water. I mainly use this to bloom yeast or stir up waffle batter.
3,doesn't seal,I bought it for a butter dish that I could mindlessly use the soften and melt features on my microwave. It works ok if I baby it and watch it.
2,Lid does not seal-not airtight,"I use this cup in 2 cup size for making salad dressing. I make enough for a couple of nights and like to put the rest in the refrig. I had been covering my cup with saran, so I jumped at this cup with lid. Problem is, it does not seal. There is a big gap between the spout and the lid. So, the dressing dries out or the dressing (if garlic/onion/shallot) smell permeates through the refrig. It does not seal so liquids will leak out of the spout. It would be good for pouring off liquids from, say, micro'd veggies.The other irritating thing is, I have 2 other PYREX 2-cup measuring cups (I bought this 3rd cup bec of the lid), and the lid doesn't fit them."

1,"Designed by idiots, DO NOT BUY!","OK, the thing does hold 8 cups as promised. The Pyrex appears (I am not an expert) to be second class, but I may be wrong. What is appalling is the design of the spout. If one pours with it the stream clings to the bowl and makes a huge mess. If this thing was truly made in the USA (it says so on the product) it is a scathing indictment of our educational system (design), and of quality control (did anybody ever try this design in real life?). Not worth sending back."
1,The cover is a JOKE,I'm so disgusted with this product I'd have fought to return it after I used it if it wasn't relatively cheap (and I am keen to avoid the hassle of shipping it back etc.).The cover is worthless. It doesn't fit onto the top of the container properly. If I hadn't received the container and top together I would have bet that they were not a match. The cover is supposed to slide down inside the measure cup. Not a chance. Only about half of the cover can fit. There was empty space in weird places too. It's hard to explain (and I know I'm struggling with the description!) but the bottom line is that the cover doesn't work. I highly recommend against this product if you're interested in something with any kind of cover at all.
5,Best big glass measuring cup ever!,"I love my Pyrex measuring cup. Actually, at 8 cups, it's more the size of a bowl. And I use it for mixing too, because of the handle and pour spout. I have had mine for 9 months now and the red lettering is still in place, despite many trips through my washing machine. I microwave stuff in it too, it is versatile like that.I love the heft of it, because it seems very durable. Of course if I drop it on the floor, I guess it would break - but I am not planning on doing that.I have an 8 cup plastic measuring cup too, but I find that my Pyrex glass one is the one I take out of the cabinet to use.I have never used the lid that came with it. I suppose I might if I ever mixed something up in it and transferred it to the refrigerator, like say a dip or something.I urge you to buy this."
5,Pyrex is the best,I use this big bowl at least once a week. It's great for storing homemade pizza dough overnight in the fridge.
5,Perfect for small kitchens,"Excellent all purpose kitchen tool: microwave in it, mix in it, and, oh yeah, it's a measuring cup, too."
4,Predicable .... but worth the read,"Tim Green creates an acion pack read that will hold your attention from start to finish.Season eade,however,may guess the ending before the try is over."
2,Shame on me!!,"I kept hoping it would get better - perhaps the characters would develop... perhaps there was a great twist in the plot. No such luck. The story is weak, the characters weaker and the ""twist"" was laughable!If you really want to read it, get a copy from your local library and save your money for a really good book!"
1,This book was BAD reading!,"What a bore! Green's writing was too simplistic, the plot was too predictable, and the characters were one-dimensional. Because of these faults, I found it really hard to remain interested in following what the main character, Kurt Ford, was planning in avenging his son's death, even if this meant to kill the President of the U.S.If you want to read a good intriguing book with a strong story plot and character development, try the classics from Daniel Silva (The Unlikely Spy) or Ken Follett (The Eye of the Needle)."
4,Entertaining read,"First book that I've read by Tim Green. After reading ""The Fourth Perimeter"", I look forward to trying some of his other work. A satisfying read for anyone who enjoys suspense/action with a political element. Interesting, yet believable characters mixed with corruption, secret agents and enough action to keep the pages turning."
3,good book (with a little help from former Secret Service agent Larry Newman),"This is a good book, not a great one. The author greatfully acknowledges the help of former Secret Service agent Larry Newman (of ""The Dark Side Of Camelot"" fame).Vince Palamara-JFK/ Secret Service expert (History Channel, author of two books, in over 30 other author's books, etc.)Pittsburgh, PABEST JFK ASSASSINATION BOOK: ULTIMATE SACRIFICEBEST JFK SECRET SERVICE BOOK: SURVIVOR'S GUILT BY YOURS TRULY :)"
2,Good idea - bad execution,"This is a simplistic book in many ways. The ""real"" bad guy was evident within the first few chapters, the plotting seemed to race along with any regard for buildup or previous action but worse of all, the characters seemed totally unrealistic. The hero seemed to have no grief for his murdered son but kept on with appointments, plans, meetings, sex, etc as if nothing had happened.The trick of killing anyone who could possibly contribute to the depth of the story (agents, policemen, bad girl) was pushed to the extreme. I am glad this was a book at the home we stayed at on the beach and I did not fork over any money."
1,"lousy writing, poor characterizations","This may well be the WORST thriller I've ever read. This book's interesting jacket drew me to it, but thats about the only thing this monumental catastrophe has going for it. Over a lifetime of reading thousands of books, I've only put aside a handful as ""too lousy to finish"" - those decisions were made with 1/3 of the book remaining. For this one, I'm only 17 pages in (10 of them being prologue), and already want every character to die. This writer has managed to throw every trite, hackneyed, overused and worn out cliche into this book. I found myself wanting to enter it into the Bulwer-Litton Bad Fiction contest - I'm sure it would be a sweep.What an embarrassment - if I could give it a negative rating, I would."
1,Tim Green is no Robert Ludlum,"The Fourth Perimeter was disappointing to say the least. Mr. Green's writing style was also very surprising for a best selling author. In many places, sentences referenced the main character both by name and personal pronoun, even when the character was alone and the reader knew to whom the author was referring. I really started to laugh at some of the passages about Jill's friendship with Jeremiah, which I thought was an unnecessary side plot. There were many attempts to foster empathy from the reader for the main character, but they didn't work for me. Mr. Green tries to fill in background details about the characters and their motivation, but often times they seem more ""Oh, by the way"" references and seem out of place in the middle of action scenes. My overall impression was that the book read like an average movie script that goes straight to video...For readers who like this genre, I would recommend Robert Ludlum's ""The Janson Directive"" over this novel."
1,"Sharp, Lightweight, Dangerous Design! Avoid...","This knife is nice and lightweight and seems like it is of reasonably good quality. I haven't used it much yet. I did, however, discover that the open handle design is quite flawed. It allows your finger tip to come in contact with the blade on the closed position and I have already taken a small piece of flesh off my finger reaching into my pocket. Also, when folding the knife, it is very possible to have a piece (or if your finger is quite small, such as a young user, a section of your finger) through the holes in the handle which could cause a very serious wound. If your finger were through the frame and the knife was closed with any force it would act like a pruner and lop off whatever was in the blade's path. I would not recomend this knife.The knife I purchased also came with a small utility tool with scissors, scredrivers, etc. and is small, not easy to operate and practically useless."

4,As Close to House Dance Techno Nirvana as You Can Get!,"With rhythmic Opening Matrix-like undertones, and the seemingly popular ""child-voice"" voice-overs, this is one musical piece you should not leave behind when getting the party going.In short: Get It!"
4,Succesor of Sandstorm?,This track has nice build ups and breakdowns with a trancey Asian sounding vocal and the Darude-style Sandstorm-esque melody is very well on this track. The only problem i found with this track is its to mainstream for most Rave Dj's mainstream clubs can use it except the vocal at the build up can get a little annoying it makes a good part in a DJ set to cut the treble and do a Talk-Over
1,Darude Rip Off,"This guy did nothing, but steel Darude's sound. If the guy cant come up with his own music he's no better than a club DJ. The Omnibus is a great song and probably helps Darude with CD sales because everyone thinks its him. If your going to buy this CD you might as well buy any HipHop cd since they steel or remix everyone elses music also."
3,Very cute but not very practical,This is really cute but it is difficult to get the phone out of it if the handle/strap is snapped. You have to unsnap the strap and then lift the flap to get the phone out. It's really awkward.
5,One of the most remarkable pianists on the stage!,"Arkadi Volodos is in the actual moments one of the supreme masters of the keyboard. His admirable interpretative eloquence, admirable temperament, limpid phrasing, passionate lyricism and steeled fingering makes of him one of the best gifted pianists of his generation.For all those who had had the honored privilege to watch him in live (I am not among them) and for the rest of us, who only have heard him thanks to the Digital Technology, it is a very good new to know about him, because in spite of the fact of the impressive number of new soloists in the market, Volodos has been one of the few who positively has impressed me.I hope for him new musical achievements."
3,Does Schubert need to be this delicate and restrained?,"I think the Amazon reviewer has described accurately all the virtues of Volodos' playing. His Schubert is flowing, thoughtful, and finely shaded. Volodos joins the refined ranks of Schubertians who tread poetically through his piano sonatas, and unlike Mitsuko Uchida and Radu Lupu, one can't accuse Volodos of being overly self-conscious or precious. Delicacy and restraint belong to him naturally, which is rare in his species of barnstorming virtuoso.Still, I was fairly bored the whole way through, because to my ears Schubert shouldn't sound this delicate. He isn't a trembling violet in the woods. I much prefer Richter's direct attack and Schanbel's forthrightness. Much as I admire Volodos for his gifts, not the least of which is his natural way with a lyrical line, this CD left me cold too much of the time."
3,good,"The charger was not as big as I thought, but it works,slowly. I think when I get get to use it more, it will be ok."
3,Very Lightweight but it works,"The advertising said it does a trickle charge to keep your battery charged, but the instructions say to disconnect as soon as the battery is charged. I have used it to charge my JD Lawn Tractor this winter and it has worked fine.One negative is that the charger is ultra light ... cables and power cord are heavier ... makes it harder to get the charger to lay flat after it is hooked up.This is my first charger in 50 years so I don't have enough experience to say it's a good or bad one. It works and charges quickly."
5,Excellent product,"I bought this charger/maintainer to use on an ATV that gets only sporadic use. It seems to work fine, and there haven't been any problems with dead batteries since we've started to use it. The indicator lights are clear and give a good indication of what's going on, and the price was certainly right. Note that the cigarette light plug will only work if the lighter is ""always on"" and connected to the battery; if the lighter circuit is turned off when the key isn't in the on position, then you'll have to hard-wire the charger to the battery with the included cables or else use the alligator clamps. Recommended."
5,Works fine,"I bought this charger to keep my car battery up. The car has a small parasitic drain, and I haven't had the time to track it down. For that purpose, or for charging small batteries, it works fine. Just plugs into the cars cigarette lighter receptacle. No need to unplug the charger when I leave. I just unplug the cord from the car and drive off. I did buy an extension to reach from the charger to the car."
4,Schumacher SC-200A Speedcharge Charger/Maintainer,We were skeptical about this purchase online so far we havent had any problems.Good quality for the price and i would buy again .:)
5,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,"I've been listening to Rob Mullins for literally years now. He gets better and better every time I hear him. Any reviewers that say otherwise are delusional. Everyone who has seen him live knows resoundingly that Rob Mullins is not only in the top of his craft, but as a true world class entertainer, constantly innovates and expands the limits on what's possible. He's one of the ONLY artists I've found that can at once be pushing the envelope while still honoring the history and heritage of the greats. Mullins' studio recordings are excellent but he is downright amazing in a live setting. That's why people in the know flock to his live performances. STANDARDS & MORE captures perfectly the energy and commitment he puts into his live shows and the way he delights the crowds. All the players in this album are world class and in my view Rob Mullins is far and away one of the best all around musicians on the scene today. You can't get better than the best! HIGHLY-HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
2,You don't want to know...,"The Doctor and new companion Peri, having left the desolate planet of Sarn, arrive in Astroville and witness the murder of a shopkeeper. As he dies in the arms of the travellers, he gives them the coordinates to the lost treasure of Rovan. So off on a treasure hunt go the travellers, but find they are not the only ones and that they must compete in a number of challenges to win through...I think the worst Doctor Who book in the BBC range, 'The Ultimate Treasure' is a shocker! Characterisations of the Doctor and Peri are off, the whole treasure hunt competition makes no great degree of sense, the puzzles and challenges aren't that challenging, and... Well, I could go on and on.I'm not giving this 1 star because, despite my dislike of it, Christopher Bulis is sufficiently professional that it hangs together fine. Not pretty, but fine.For Doctor Who completists only, and don't say I didn't warn you!"
4,Ridiculous Pricing,"The content gets four stars because I really enjoy this show. But this is nonsensical pricing for a 2 season package. Season 1 is less than $24, and season 2 is priced at less than $38. So purchased individually it costs around $62 for the two seasons, but if you act now you can pay $107.89 and get a combo pack of the same two seasons. I guess they must use more expensive plastic to bind them together!"
4,Altoona Baloona,This is a light and fun book that I enjoy reading as much as our three year old enjoys hearing it. As he says....Altoona Baboona sticks in our head long after we read it.
5,"An adventurous, rhyming joy of a book!","My 3- and 5-year-old love this book. The rhymes have enchanted them with their silliness and have inspired many word games in our home. Every time we read it we find new things to look at and secrets in the illustrations. It's a wonderful, sweet book that looks as good as it sounds."
4,"Noir stalwart novelist uses a lighter, deft touch","Charles Williams' THE DIAMOND BIKINI is a backwoods-themed novel taking place in the Texas hill country and uses a wonderful supporting cast that includes an uncle building an ark and an uncle making leather hides to sell. The kid narrator, Billy Noonan, tells everything in a wide-eyed wonder, but you just know it's the author's tongue-in-cheek. TDB is not for every taste, but is a funny, fun read."
1,Inexcusably poor,This book only goes to demonstrate that the author never got a firm grasp on the most basic principles of composition in the first place.
5,A great read with compelling characters,"I loved this book. I read it while on Spring Break with my kids and I enjoyed every minute of it. Hudgens is a great first time author with a real talent for (i) being funny, and (ii) slowly building compelling characters. There is even a little action and love interest thrown in for good measure. He also has a great ear for dialogue -- particularly Southern-inspired dialogue. However, you don't have to come from the South to enjoy it (I am from PA). I look forward to a sequel where Luke follows his dream and becomes a bail bondsman!"
1,Do Not Buy This,"Less than one star! This is 9 pages long and you can get considerably more information for free from web searches. IBM, HP and Sungard have excellent background information - dozens and dozens of pages for FREE. This download is a huge rip off. I recommend anything else BUT this."
2,How much is that demon in the window....,"Ohh no, please Mr. Corny demon-thing, don't hurt me! This movie just seemed to really suck. While it did scare me (mainly because the only thing scary about this movie was the monster's growl, then you see the monster and feel better) it still stunk of usual smell of B-rated monster flicks. Watching such flicks is almost a hobby of mine, and I'd have to say, in a triple threat match among this monster (whose name is forgotten or not even mentioned), Rawhead Rex, and Grim (from the similarly named film), I'd say Rawhead would go all the way, but going back to the movie, It was pretty cheesey what with all the ho-hum acting, ho-hum story, and ho-hum characters. I advise you to stay away from this movie. Just ignore it and maybe it'll go away."
2,"BORING, TACKY","Watching this movie is about as much fun as having your wisdom teeth pulled. Boring and tacky even by horror standards, the only fun comes from seeing the psychic kids' future wicked stepfather being eaten by the monster that lives in his closet, hence the title. I've seen far worse, but those worse movies were more ""enjoyable"" than this. The following morning you probably won't remember having seen it. If only the monster had eaten this movie's negative, then we would all be spared."
2,DULL!,"The movie sounded promising: a script written by the man behind the Howling, and effects from the creator of Alien, E.T. and King Kong. But, dissapointingly, the effects were the only positive aspect of the movie, although these still weren't overly adventurous. As for the screenplay, I can imagine that the novel on which it was based as having an intriguing, indepth plot. However, the movies script doesn't quite capture the intelligence of this and instead just appears silly. There is some good editing, which helps to keep the movie flowing, especially in the films closing sequences. Unfortunately this is not enough to make up for the movies obvious failings.A horror film that wants to be taken seriously must also have an atmospheric music score to help build suspense whereas, The sound track to Cameron's Closet is laughable and very tedious.If I am to compare the film to others then I guess it lies somewhere between (and far below) Poltergiest, the Exorcist and Carrie."
2,Umm... Read Please Before Buying!,"Okay, So I'm no expert on Japanese but I took it high school for two years and have self studied since (five years ago). I noticed in the 'look inside this book' that they say {amazon cannot process japanese script} ''' is 'motte' when it is actually 'mottsu'. And I asked others before posting this... So that it wasnt a spur of the moment post and I wasnt wrong. So take that into consideration when and if you get this book that it should only be used as an aid and/or reference not a sole media for learning japanese. ''''''"
3,Charlemagne forged Europe,"The author seems to be more preoccupied with describing countless abbeys, monasteries, shrines and convents than in taking the reader to the political and economic manifestos that Charlemagne - and much less so his descendants - fueled Western Europe with. Truly, Pepin the Short, Charlemagne and maybe Charles the Bald forged the transition from ""Roman"" to medieval Europe with imperative and dignified gusto, but no credit should be bestowed upon the more infamous Louis the Pious, Emperor Lothar and Louis the German. At times it appeared like Europe was going to implode, rather than explode during the reigns of some of these powerless rulers; and it was thanks to Ottonians, Capetians and Northern Spanish monarchs that Europe did attain a permanent ""forging""."
1,JUNK,"This is one of the worst pieces of junk that as cost me. After using it twice it stopped working. The instructions on the back of the box are poor. There are no instructions on changing the battery and to do so will destroy the cash. Without going in a long tirade, in short save your hard earned money and bypass this trash."
4,Inexpensive and does the job,"There isn't much to say about batteries other than they work, and they last decent amount of time. I purchased these to use in a high-powered LED flashlight and they are going strong. If they die prematurely, I will make an amendment to this review, otherwise, you can assume that they are sufficient to their task and a great deal cheaper than buying them in the store!"
5,"I was skeptical, but they are working just fine.","I have a laser pointer which uses this kind of battery and they were so expensive in local stores, and for the amazon price I decided to give it a shot. Turns out that they work fine and I saved lots of money on this batteries since I use my laser pointer a lot."
2,charger problem,"Seems like there is an issue with the charger. Whenever I connect my car charger, for a while my phone displays charging then all of a sudden error while charging. It goes on and off, I hope I'm not destroying my phone with this charger. Case and ear buds are ok.Good luck."
3,Not bad,"Good little cheapo combo. Id buy a different case, but this is a good price for an extra earpiece and car charger."
4,The Old Fashioned Way,"I grew up using all natural cures. We were poor and couldn't afford to run to the doctor for every little thing. This book contains information doctors do not tell about, and don't want you to know. I know surgery is inevitable sometimes, but give me the ""natural way"" first!"
4,much more than video killing a radio star,"That song was interesting enough to make me pick up the album a few years ago, but it quickly became my least favorite song on the album. Horn and Downes quickly grab hold of you and transport you to a frightening, futuristic world and never loosen their grip until the last chord fades. Well, it is really just two guys having fun in a recording studio, but it is unfortunate that they will never be more than the answer to an MTV trivia question to my Dave Matthews loving generation. No offense Dave, you were just the first to come to mind. Each song is a miniature futuristic story in which the past always seems to be recalled as being better than the present. Get ready for a sci-fi adventure that you won't regret; you'll even find yourself in a B-movie."
5,An excellent album of electronic musical genius.,"Every song on this album is a joy to listen to. ""Clean, Clean,"" ""Johnny on the Monorail,"" and ""Video Killed the Radio Star"" stand out as the best, although it's difficult to pick favorites. I never tire of listening to it. Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes' production is superb."
3,Electronic Strangeness,"I've always thought that this release was one of the most eccentric synth albums out there. Geoff Downes and Trevor Horn came up with some strange, yet listenable tunes. Bright spots are ""Video Killed the Radio Star,"" ""I Love You (Miss Robot),"" and ""Astroboy."" The album sounds dated, but it still is (and was) quite original. Anything with Geoff Downes on it is always worth a listen."
5,Five stars is not enough! Pure class!,"I have been a closet fan of The Buggles since I heard them 'on the wireless' back in '89. I finally picked up this album today and am glad I did. Video Killed the Radio Star is a classic. Bottom line. Techno Pop sounds like something off of an early Nik Kershaw album, such is the similarity between Kershaw's and Horn's voices, and the overall sound. Great! Elstree is on par with 'Radio Star', and to me is a sort of 'TV Killed the B movie Star'. It is my favourite song on the album. The whole album is way ahead of its time in its sound, lyrics, effects and production and it is a crying shame that Horn and Downes did not have more success at the time."
4,Great Album,"I was a little skeptical of this album considering that their last album (Republic) was so-so. However, this album is too good to pass up!"
2,Same old same...,"Look, I really have enjoyed some of their stuff over the years. I bought this when it came out, gave it a listen, and put it away. It didn't register much one way or the other. Same sound. My seventeen year old daughter recently grabbed some of my cd's along with some of her's and loaded up the ten cd changer in the bug. We listened to ""Get Ready,"" and I cringed at the vocals, really lame: ""I live to die, I live to get high."" Whatever. Her choice ""Lucy Ford"" by Atmosphere came up next and blew me away with its honesty and vibe, and I'm not even a big rap fan! I immediately tried to sell my copy of ""Get Ready"" here. Used price: $1.19. Says it all. Want a similar sound to ""Get Read,"" but with intelligence? Try Electronic's ""Raise the Pressure"" instead. It won't embarass you."
2,GET READY FOR THE SAME OLD SOUND....but sounding worse,"New Order is back with ""Get Ready"". 8 years since their last album ""Republic"".""Get Ready"" falls flat, sounding like it is taking from previous songs and remixing them to fit a new millenium sound...It doesn't work.I grew up in the 80s, I was a New Order fan, Joy Division fan even a Electronic fan.New Order had their time in the 80s and even early 90s, with such dance classics as ""Bizarre Love Triangle"", ""1963"", ""Perfect Kiss"", etc.However on ""Get Ready"" it sounds like the same mish-mash without the standout hooks, or dancebeats.New Order should of hung up their coat with their last (4 star effort) ""Republic"".""Get Ready"" is just a poor excuse to get back on the charts.....a shame."
5,Funny thing happen while surfing........,"I just happen to be listening to this very CD while looking at some items at Amazon.comThis album is one of the best releases in a long time. I find myself listening to it a lot. I carry about 40 CD's with me and this one is always being played. I am glad to see them back together after all the side projects, from Electonic and Revenge.New Order has always been one of my favorites and will continue to be one. With CD's like this one, it will be readily available.Cheers"
1,New Odor,"This CD should come with a ""Sell By Date."" There's nothing on this disk that bridges New Order from synth-pop to a new realm of ""post synth-pop with an Ginzu Edge."" It's offensive to the loyal ""Old"" New Order base, and disinteresting to a new generation of listeners.Try bands like Placebo, George or Gomez if you're looking for a new order music. At least they've invested time in some LYRICS!"
1,COMPLETE DISAPPOINTMENT,"Another cd you can do without. I am an old New Order fan but only got this one because I had a gift certificate. Now wish I would have bought an Anita O'Day cd with it. Funny how BLASE groups get with all their millions. Not even writing, credits or titles on the cd label. No Title on the front cover graphics. A simpleton photo of a girl in ""paint-stained"" jeans, having nothing to do with the music. The fold-out brochure a compete diappointment from Peter Saville, with poorly designed nothingness. The music itself sounds like the band was bored-- very bored. New Order would have let better be ending their legend with the REPUBLIC cd, and retiring for good to Monaco or to their saloon. It's plainly miserable music, sounding forced, contrite and embarrassing for 40-yr-olds to insult their legions of ""former"" fans. Don't bother purchasing this one. In fact, I give it less than a star. I'll be offering it at auction with a starting bid of maybe a penny."
3,Sorry - they've lost their touch...,"Or maybe time has really just passed them by. The first 3 songs on this album are alright, but it goes downhill from there. Too ""pop/rock"" sounding for this New Order fan. They should have stuck to pop-synth. But others like it, so what can I say?"
3,So-So release,"When I heard Billy Corrigan contributed his guitar work to this release, warning sirens went off. My worst fears were realized. While a few tracks have kept the catchy classic New Order bass line, and they haven't totally abandoned the synth, much of this cd is rehashed modern rock garbage, especially tracks 6 & 7. The best track is Primitive Notion, the one that is most consistent with the classic New Order sound. Leave it to Billy Corrigan to ruin a perfectly good 80's group. Bernard Sumner, what were you thinking???"
3,Don't love it,"Maybe I haven't given it time to grow on me yet, but I'm not overly impressed. I have had all their albums up to this one for a long time and had high hopes for this one, especially based on the other reviews here. It reminds me more of Regret (and some of the second Electronic album) than earlier albums and none of the songs really jump out at me. I've only listed to it three times, so I'm sure I'll warm up to it a bit more."
5,...keep it coming...,"there's not much to say about New Order's latest album, 'Get Ready' except for this. New Order's 'Get Ready' could be the BEST album this year! The album is rocking, yet, you can dance to it. Atmospheric, yet, down to earth. 'Get Ready' might be the greatest LP New Order has ever created. Just one listen and you'll definitely agree and you won't be disappointed. A exhilarating, breath-taking album, created by four eternally young kids. 'Get Ready' is a must-buy!"
3,"OK, but 80's stuff is better!",This cd is nothing like their catchy 80's hits. Its ok though....nothing to get too excited over...
4,A. Great Ready,"I remember picking up Republic in college and ripping open the CD with rediculous anticipation of what ultimately ended up being a mediocre album that I am marginally embarrassed to admit that I thought I liked just because it was New Order. 8 years later, I was skeptical until I saw some of the reviews of this album. It truly is incredibile, and I am pretty suprised that they pulled this off. It should be looked at as a mood album, yes the individual songs are good in and of themselves, but the album together can transfix a relatively normal hour of driving or hanging out into an experience that can only be apprectiated by listening through all 10 songs, much like the Cure's Disintegration. Hook's base is back, reminiscent of low life, and the beat and keyboards remind me off technique, with louder guitars."
5,Great return to form,"It's been a few years, and their last effort was a bit of a disappointment (except for the brilliant song ""Regret"") but this new collection of tunes shows that New Order have returned to top form.Although I've only listened to this about 5 times now, I think that it's going to be a toss up for me as to whether this or ""Low Life"" is their best recording."
2,bluh.,"New Order is, without question, one of the most significant bands of the 80's. They have produced music that is innovative, forward-thinking, danceable, rough, edgy, beautiful. I guess I was thinking of this when I was standing in the record shop, wondering whether or not it is gonna be worth it for me to shell out my cash to pay for an import price on their new album.Why, oh why, oh why did I do this? Didn't I learn from ""Republic?"" Apparently not. This album is just not worth it. Bland, guitar-oriented, glossy pop stuff that really doesn't go anywhere. The first single, ""Crystal,"" is good in its remixed form. Perhaps New Order will have a triumphant return to the Billboard Dance Charts - I'll give 'em that. My guess would be that New Order completists will (or already have) purchased this, but unfortunately, it's a painful reminder that one of the greatest synth bands in history is way past its creative peak."
5,"Yet again, New Order show their brilliance","New Order are back after 8 years and they are as great as ever. This album is much more guitar-driven; a reminder of the Brotherhood/Low-life era. Hooky, Stephen and Bernard are all present and accounted for, with only Gillian missing truth be told (due to her and Stephen's ailing daughter). And while this may harken back to the B/Ll era musically, this is a band that has grown and matured.Aside from the dodgy Rock the Shack, every song is a winner. And the only problem with RtS is the chorus, other than that it's a great tune as well. Buy the album, you won't be disappointed, it is definitely one of the best thing to be released this year, along with Faithless's Outrospective and Gorillaz's self-titled effort.New Order have always, and will always be the best band in the world. End of story."
4,"more power to ""new order""","I have been waiting forever for this album to come out and I bought it back in August 2001 as an import. It is unbelivable and great. I loved it from the first time I heard it. ""Crystal"" is a great song but certainly is not the only great song in this album. I love very song except ROCK THE SHACK and believe that Bernald S. has done it again. His song writting skills and vocals improve as he gets older. This album reminds me so much of Electronic's ""Twisted Tendernous"". Go out and get it."
3,disappointing for a beloved band,"I've loved New Order's music since I got into it 15 years ago. This CD has glimpses of their early works - post Joy Division and pre-Substance - but not enough. For the most part, it ranks with the works tracks on those earlier songs. It's got that ""garage band"" sound that I long for but comes across more like a jam with everyone ignoring the other - unfinished and lacking a musical plot. I'm thrilled New Order has a new collection out and glad I bought it, but I'm hoping they do another one soon that is back on track in quality, regardless of style, of yore."
3,"I like it, but I'll never love it","I don't think I came across a single review in the music press that didn't say this was a big improvement over REPUBLIC. As far as I'm concerned, GET READY doesn't come close to the quality of REPUBLIC or even TECHNIQUE. This is solid and entertaining, but I'll take synthy New Order any day over this more guitar-based outing."
4,a great new order record,"This is the New Order record I've been waiting 20 years for. A collection of pure rock and roll tracks. This is a well produced record with lots of great tunes. There are one or 2 misfires, and the occasional inane lyric, but it's still immensly enjoyable."
4,Get Ready!,"The previous review puts it best. NO's experimentationwith guitars blends well with their trademark synth-beats.'Crystal' has the potential to be a huge hit, even in aworld dominated by metal-(c)rap. One will be reminded ofhow music was in the 80s, (if old enough to remember...),making high schoolers of the time remember of the new wavestyle of pop, in a time when the worst thing to happen inhigh school was an occasional fist-fight, in which both parties can be seen that same night congratulating each other on a'good fight', and a time when the worst event seen on tvwas the Challenger 'accidently' taking a few lives.Long live New Order!!"
5,Best album of the decade so far,"I rate this the best rock record of the decade. New Order does a great job of mixing guitars, synthesizers, and drums into a hard rock effort that is filled with memorable melodies and hooks. Peter Hook's bass lines are awesome and Stephen Morris's drumming is propulsive. This makes Radiohead's recent offerings sound amateurish."
2,primitive notion indeed,"It was only a matter of time. I did not expect a return to glory, but this? This wasteland of insipidity speaks poorly of a band that took eight years to release new material. They took their time, so we like sheep waited, and what do we get? This insult to good taste and manners. By the fourth track one forgets to what he is listening. The complete lack of imagination put on open display by this once proud band would not be such a travesty if it weren't so dangerous. I fell asleep driving to work to this noise and nearly killed a tree.Alas, I have moved on. And so should you. If you are an unthinking blind follower, buy the CD. If you can still see past your own nose, then consider other options. Like clipping your toenails, or picking up after the dog."
4,Pretty Good,"A little wobbly, but pretty good. I would definately NOT recommend using the item as a stand alone bassinet with these legs on (which is also the recommendation of the manufaturer). I feel safe using it attached to the bed, and it is SO nice to have my son RIGHT THERE!"
1,Beware problem with older model,"Description of the item does not mention that it can only fit newer models of co-sleepers. Ours was purchased early 2004 and the extensions we bought do not fit. If the underside of your co-sleeper's feet has a plastic line/tab that goes down the middle of the U-shaped foot, then you have the older model."
1,Does NOT work on older model co-sleepers,"Received this item and it would not fit on our cosleeper. After much searching on the internet I discovered that the design of the legs was changed on the co-sleepers approx. 2 years ago (2003?) and the leg extensions do not work on the older model. With the use of some power tools and duct tape we were able to make them work, but this information should definitely be provided when you read about the item.I'm sure the extensions are fine if you have a newer model cosleeper."
5,One of the best I've read in a long time,I picked this book up and read the description and was interested to read it. Well once I got home I couldn't put it down. I was so captured by the romance of Edie and Dylan that I had to run out the next day and get the next two books in the series. This is one of those books that I will pass on and then once it comes back to me I will read over and over again.
4,A little gem,One of most common problems with most math textbooks is the excess of inappropriate details. The basic format of this book is concise presentation of the essentials followed by diverse problems. Instead of giving an imcomplete introduction to the more advanced ideas like some authors do Jackson and Thoro tell you where to find them in other books at the end of every section. This book is proof that it doesn't take a famous mathematician to write a good book.
5,This Book Is A 'Must Read',"Rob Ellis, with his experience as a professional player and coach (as well as being a licensed clinical therapist) is as fine a writer on hitting as I have found. As a developer of a the largest website on the internet devoted totally to hitting (with members in all 50 states and 15 foreign countries) I can truly say that Rob's articles on this site have had a most positive effect on the members. There have been many good comments on Rob's articles - many of the articles taken from this book. The Online Hitting Academy takes pride in having Rob Ellis as a long-standing regular writer. I would advise anyone interested in developing their hitting skills or those of their team to definately study any of Rob's books. ""The Mike Schmidt Study"" should be a standard on any coach's or player's bookshelf. It's a 'must read' for anyone who is serious about learning the techniques and skills that have helped even seasoned professionals!"
4,Folk music from Brittany,"This is Celtic music from Brittany that is compelling, haunting, and different. Most will think it sounds like: Dead can dance, with real words, and the lead singer from that group does sing on some of Denez Prigent CDs. However, if you like celtic music, and are getting tired of the almost pop presentations of some folk groups this is a refreshing change."
2,It does Work,Well it does work but must be old or something it does not hold a charge for long . Im hoping after I charge it several times it might last longer. As far as the service goes gerat it was shiped fast and easy no trouble at all .
3,Extra Extra Read All About it Jimmy Olson Saves Las Vegas,"Title is too long, and hence sounds a bit hokey.However, once past the title, the book is a good, interesting read for his first time out. Having visited this part of New Mexico, I can attest that the author is true to its setting, both physically and culturally.Book could be a little longer, though."
4,More than the war,"This is one of the few books written about the Modoc that does not focus solely on the war of 1872-1873. It provides background on the tribes reputation, Bloody Point (on the Applegate Trail) and on Ben Wright's actions against the Modoc.This book gives the needed background to understand why there was a Modoc War at all."
3,"Hot, Hot, Hot","Tastes pretty good, but they are really spicy. Almost too spicy for me and I like red hot chilli."
5,"Gentle, Moving, Worshipful","Fernando is a quiet burn. His music gently pierces through the soul to reach the innermost portions. When I first heard him, it was easy to assume that he was another CCM fluff artist with platitudes to share. However, underneath his accessable chord structures lies a quality of music, a depth of thought, and above all, a desire to engage the listener in worship that truly has refreshed me. I purchased Home after hearing it at a friends house, and over a period of several months, it rarely left my player--but I was unhappy that a few of the cuts seemed to lack focus. Storms seems much more focused to me, even more worshipful, and truly has been helpful in pointing me to my Bible. This is worth your time and your listen."
3,nice collection,I enjoyed this CD. it's not one that i will listen to non-stop all week but it's a nice enjoyable CD.
5,Great Artist,One of Christian music's best kept secrets. Fernando combines the old and the new creating another awesome CD.
5,Saving Grace,"Matthew is one of those amazing bands that comes along once in a long while and never gets the respect they deserve. Do yourself a favor and download ""Open Wide"" or ""You Thought"", you'll see what I mean. McSweeney has a haunting and moving emo voice that mixes perfectly with the Radiohead like instrumentals. This is a CD that I love to pop in when I feel like the world is too much. Too amazing for words. BUY THIS CD!"
4,Seven Day Jesus,"Everyone is giving this album pretty great reviews, but no one has mentioned the groups previous efforts... well, the members previous efforts anyway. The frontmen were frontmen for a group called Seven Day Jesus, a great band that disbanded after only two albums. Both of these releases were excellent. the first ""the hunger"" was darker, harder. the second self-titled disc was much poppier and therefore much more successful. i reccomend every Matthew fan to check them out."
1,Boring.,"This has to be one of the dullest, most uninspiring albums I've heard all year. McSweeney does his best to sound like Thom Yorke and falls flat on his face. Every song here is a complete snooze. None of the tracks will leave any sort of impression on you other than the fact that Matthew obviously likes Radiohead a lot. Why Ryko signed these guys up is puzzling. A complete waste of time."
5,Truly Consuming,"I have had this game for about a year and have logged about 140 hours of play and I am still enjoying it very much. The game can move fast and you can be defeated rather quickly if disregard the principles of war. The use of Priest and Druids can decide your outcome depending on how well you use them. I personally like using the Battleships to win my campaigns. And on occasion I have been able to throw a hail mary and take out the opponent quickly and decisively. I must confess that I have come to enjoy playing from the Roman vantage but I have also taken out some Gaulic tribes and used them to defeat my opponents. I am truly looking forward to Celtic Kings: The Punic Wars, which will have more weapons, training, tribes (Romans, Iberians, Carthaginians) and battle formations. If you love strategy games than this one is for you."
1,Not For Adults,"If you're a fan of Historically-based strategy war-gaming, this game will disappoint. The name and the product description lead one to beleive that this plays like a strategy game. It plays more like a fantasy roll-playing game. The plot-line, and play are more than a little sophomoric. I lasted one game.I should have played a demo before I dropped cash on this game."
2,ok game......very hard,"this game is ok the bad out weighs the good by a mile. 1. you cant build anything 2. your peasent have almost no options to control them 3. you dont destroy buildings, you capture them.....gay!!! 4.the single player maps are really easy, and boring. the rts-rpg part of the game ( which was why i bought it) was very dissapointing. now for the good, 1.the rts-rpg idea for this game was a good idea, just poorely done 2.each unit has levels and your heros have names and can carry items that can heal or raise attack and defense. borrow from a freind or buy it......for very cheap"
1,I should have known better...,"""Gap Analysis"" seems to be a buzz word being tossed around for some time. I thought that this article would provide an example of how a gap anaylsis works. Not to give away any secrets (as if there are any!), it basically walks you through an overview of protecting your system.This is something you would give upper management. It has it's place, that why I gave it one star.It isn't technical - it really doesn't give an explaination of Gap Analysis. Search the web ... for a better idea and save your money."
5,excellent base layer,"This long-sleeve crew is high quality, warm, and feels soft to the skin. It is doing a great job keeping me warm this winter. You can also wear it to bed, and it works great as pajamas."
2,Duofold,"My shirt is already unraveling up the side, which is ridiculous. Its not that the shirt is too small or under any stress either. I actually bought it oversized a bit. Its just not as well made as the ancient one by the same company I bought it to replace. Like many companies, this one seems to have let quality slip over the years."
2,Sexy Senior,Have a 15 year old Duofold shirt that I wear during my winter runs of 4 miles. It has developed a few holes. This shirt is not close to quality and weight of the older model. I use the midweight as a dry shirt change after summer runs. It bearly keeps my sweaty torso warm in 70 degree air temperatures.Order at least one size larger. If you want to stay warm go with a heavier version or buy something else.
4,wealth of information,"This book is small, but loaded with information that is useful for anyone interested in aromatherapy. The chapter for individual essential oils describes their characteristics and properties with photos of the source. Many recipes are included, with detailed instructions on methods. All in all this is a great book. It was my first aromatherapy book. The only drawback, and the reason I rated it with a '4' is that I have a vision problem and the print is extremely small and the ink is not black. It seems to blend into the paper and I must struggle to read it. With such a small book I think black ink would have been appropriate... not as aesthetically pleasing, but more readable."
3,"Not a ""Bible""","While the book came in a very timely manner and is in excellent condition I was rather disappointed by the information it provided... very little is on actual aromatherapy and no mixing chart is to be found in the book.Okay for a complimentary book, but not a good idea for anyone who wants to use it as a reference guide."
3,good information,"This has lots of good information in it about the different oils, origins and uses. It was a bit simpler than expected but helpful and useful."
3,not a bible,"Yes, there is much information here but it covers too many areas that are not aromatherapy. Pages & pages devoted to massage & meditation techniques, emotional issues, yet only 2 pages to discuss the concept of top, middle & base notes. What about how to actually use those little bottles, some with special techniques to actually get the oil to flow or others that are open necked & will spill everywhere. And if you want to look up a specific oil - no such luck. Details on each oil are grouped by their type: citrus, root, flower. If you don't know the type then you must page thru the entire section cause there is not an index listing for the various oils. Bad editing choice. I would not recommend this book - find something else."
3,There are more comprehensive guides out there....,"I was looking for a book with more in depth information on the use of essential oils and more recipes, but this is more of a basic guide to general information on oils. It does have a nice section on the background of some of the popular oils and where they come from, but unless you are very new to essential oils, i'd go with a more comprehensive guide. This book did not fulfill my expectations."
4,good for basics,"I do tend to go back to this book whenever Im about to mix some oils or looking for new ones...or even what I want to use based on my mood. I do feel like there's a lot of info that wasnt even tapped into, but this did cover so many subjects, I can just imagine the size it wouldve been if it had went into thorough detail on every topic touched. I did learn a lot from this book."
4,Good addition to aromatherapy library,"It's a small aromatherapy bible but it's packed with wonderful ideas, recipes and blends for the essential oil lover. The pictures are very vibrant. It's small enough to be portable and share with others."
4,Exciting Transformers.,"Introduction and I am not good at English.All in all, I thought he is cool.There is a portion whose joint is somewhat hard.But, I think I can enjoy the toy.Thank you."
5,The essential koran is the best introduction for many to Islam,"Before all the religious rules and tribal stories that can be boring at first, the ""Essence of Koran"" presents faith in ONE invisible GOD, spirituality and human attainment of goodness first, as they were first presented by all known Prophets. This is a great introduction for non-Muslims and for Muslims of habit who may need to simply start over to rediscover Islam on their own, beyond traditions and religious customs that have inundated them. I think this book is great for classrooms. This is the best book introduction to Islam that I have read and I have read many 'bad' introductions to Islam. No tribalisms and cultural bias has been injected into the translation. Mr. Cleary presents his translation of plain on Islamic pearls of the Quran without personal editorials. Best start to the study of 'pure' Islam."
2,"Disappointing, like chewing on paper",I must confess that I was unable to read this cover to cover as it was so dry and tasteless. It seems to me from other sources I have read that the Quran is a Book of beautiful poetic mystic style with many levels of reality as all mystic books have. There is no way of discerning that from this translation. I know there must be better out there. If anyone can recommend one I would love to know about it.
2,No philosphy,"A problem for anyone trying to get to grips with Islam is that it has no structured philosophy. Those who tried to formulate one, such as al-Suhrawardi in 1191, tend to be executed.It is just faith. Believe these ideas, however daft they may seem to the rational mind. That is all there is. However much a book may emphasise the poetry and beauty of the writing, it does not develop into anything intellectually valuable or acceptable to rationally minded people.The effect of this it to create an aggressive and expansionist society, intolerant of any questioning or free discussion."
2,Not the one,"I was so distressed by this translation of the Koran that I went to a scholarly Muslim friend--for I read no Arabic. He assured me I was right: ""It's a terrible translation."" The tone is inconsistent, the annotation hardly helpful, and the insistance on using ""God's"" instead of ""His"" annoying and clumsy. The device seems to be borrowed from PC Christians. I am sorry I am required to use it with my students."
1,Poor Kindle Version...,"This book is certainly worthy of your consideration. However, it is a very poor Kindle version. No Index, no links to help you navigate. There is a Glossary, but it left me wondering why they included it when there are no page numbers/links to help you find anything that is listed!The thought of carrying this around as a tourist seems like a nightmare! I feel as though I totally wasted my money!Do not buy the Kindle version - buy the book instead!"
5,Quite simply the best,"As someone who has haunted Paris for decades, I can say that there is no more wonderful companion than Thirza Vallois. Her three volumes of Around and About Paris, covering every arrondissement with both erudition and joy, are almost as deep and rich and rewarding as the city itself. They are to be carried about for consulting on foot, and read in your armchair for pleasure and information you will not find in the run-of-the-mill ""guide."" These books are for explorers and dreamers, scholars and lovers. If you want to know Paris, you can not do better."
4,"""So many morons, so little time.""","The newest Maggody book is out and it is a hoot! If you loved the previous books, waited with baited breath for the next installment of life in Maggody, this book does NOT disappoint! The infusion of 21st Century technology in the form of a computer lab in a ""temporary classroom"" (read trailer) outside the high school makes for a great starting point for mystery, murder, and more craziness from your favorite characters. Updating on the twins, the cafe, the mooshiners, and the rest of the inhabitants of Maggody make the murder and the solving of it much more fun since it ""feels like home!"" The humor is great -- from Ruby and Estella under the trailers at the trailer park to the sudden disappearance of a load of moonshine! Buckle up! It is a great read!"
3,I was VERY DISAPPOINTED!,I have read all of the Joan Hess Maggody series books and this was was missing something. The ending was more disappointing than the rest. I usually enjoy her books and i read this one front to end but it didn't have the same kind of keep you reading quality about it that the previous ones have had and I felt that it was kind of a hurry up and finish book.
2,A disappointment for a Maggody fan,"I have been a Maggody enthusiast for quite a few years and look forward to each new book. Something seemed to be missing in this one. It had a ""slapped together quickly"" quality about it. The characters were not nearly as well drawn nor fleshed out as usual. If I had not read all of the previous Maggody books, this one sure would not prompt me to become a fan of the series. The murderer and murderee were easy to figure out early on. I felt Joan Hess did not concentrate enough on the quirky characters already established in previous stories. Their endearing pecularities were not explored as in past books. There were many Buchanon names bandied about, but I would have liked more description of them and their kin. The names are certainly unforgettable-""Idalupino"" is my all time favorite! Joan Hess has done such a good job with most of the Maggody books, I forgive her for this one which I feel is not one of her better efforts and still look forward to the next one."
4,Maggody enters the 21st Century (but not the Buchanon's),"Any Joan Hess release will make my day, while this one is not on a par with some of her others it was still a fun read, her Maggody series makes me laugh out loud and I find that very rare these days. I will be eagerly awaiting the next installment of the trials and tribulations of the residents of Maggody Ark."
1,Pull the plug!,"As a long-time fan of Joan Hess in general and the Maggody series in particular, I eagerly awaited the arrival of ""Murder@Maggody.com"". Now I am returning it for a refund. This particular effort lacks something which I can not put into words, and never really takes off. The premise was a great idea-bring the 90's into Maggody on the cusp of the new century(erronously known as the millenium). The storyline fell short though, and I was able to identify the murder solution before the murder even occurred. Too many new characters were introduced. One of the endearing traits of Maggody is sense of familiarity and character history. I did the storyline involving the ""porno pics"" flashing through e-mail. Ms. Hess could have and should have further expanded it. If Estelle's mysterious secret was ever revealed-it made no impact on my mind. Maybe we'll have better luck with the new Claire Malloy which is previewed in ""Holly Jolly Murder"""
2,Part of the Maggody series. But start with the first one.,"MURDER@MAGGODY.COM is my first Arly Hanks book, but it looks like this one's about the 11th in the series that must have begun with MISERY LOVES MAGGODY. This appears to be a really popular series, and comes highly recommended by friends, but do NOT start with this one. Oh, sure, it has great local characters and a lot of humor, but I kept thinking I was missing out on something. The jokes seemed to be ""in"" jokes. I couldn't get the full understanding, as they say. I'm betting that if I went back and read the first one and then read this over I'd get more out of it. This book has a truly colorful story and takes quite a few twists and turns, but I won't read another one in this series unless it's the first one."
2,if you like hee haw...,"This book is overly wordy, and plays the hillbilly joke over and over and over and ... After you read most of the book, you finally get to the murder, and then read the next 100 pages discovering you knew exactly who did it. Not much of a mystery. And not very exciting."
1,I want my money back!,"I left the theatre in the middle of this movie, and I can't bear to watch the rest of this film. This movie will give you some nightmares when you fall asleep, and on the wake of another bomb scare in London and other cities with major airports, where terrorists are using liquids to use those bombs in flights from London-People are now leaving their drinks and essential toiletries behind. A lot them are now in fear as they prefer to do their traveling now on either a bus or a train. Furthermore, We need to pay some respect to the bravest people in NYC who fought the war on both sides of the planet as we continue to fight for this country and to show much we love it. Every September 11th from this moment on will forever be known as patriots' day. This also happens to be the day where people needs to stop doing their traveling while they show some respect for those people who died at the WTC, The Pentagon, and in Western Pennsylvania. We Salute You!"
1,Aaaaaargh!,"Give these people a hand. And by ""hand"" I mean ""a book on snakes"" which none of these directors seem to own.The acting: Blah.Action: Blah.Humor: Good(That guy from Saterday Night Live saved it with ""Praised be Playstation!"")Snakes: Uuuuugh. WHY ARE THERE SEA SNAKES IN THIS?!Continueing on that subject, there is no such thing as an all blue snake. Oddly, why did one of the passengers get killed by VINE SNAKES? The co-pilot(From Ancorman: Legend of Ron Burgendy)was bitten by a Gaboon viper. This will kill you in minutes, not 2 hours. Being spat in the eyes by a spitting cobra does NOT induce ""eye rabies"" or foaming. Next time you make a movie like this, hire Jeff Corwin. Atleast he knows anacondas don't look like ball pythons.In other words, this movies trash. The woman at the DvD rentle place said ""The late fees for this movie are alot lower, its that bad."""
4,I laughed so hard............,".....milk came out of my nose. And I wasn't even drinking milk at the time. It must have been snake venom.I love Samuel L. Jackson........as an actor that is! ;^) I would not have watched this movie if he were not in it, because there was no way the plot could be anything but stupid. Well, the plot was pretty stupid, but Jackson made the movie work. There was plenty of action, and even though most of the snakes looked fake because they were CG snakes, the snake attacks were pretty good. I rolled on the floor laughing at several points during the film, so I guess it did have entertainment value after all. Nobody ever said a movie has to be a masterpiece of cinematography to be entertaining."
2,2.5 stars: Cheesy Updated version of 1960's B movie horror flicks..........,"With all of the technology that we have today, why do the snakes in this movie look like tech from the 60's and 70's? Other than that, I compare this movie to the B movie horror flicks of the 1960s."
1,This has got to be,"one of the worst movies... if not THE worst movie ever made. So typical and predictable, cheesy and downright stupid. I couldn't finish watching it."
1,Not good enough for back ground noise.,Forced myself to watch this movie as punishment for buying it. Actually felt dumber afterwards. That is 106 minutes of my life that I will never get back.
3,snakes on a plane,"dear amazon, that was a funny movie, but if you ever fly in a plane beware of snakes. you wont see them at first becoze they will be hidden but then they will jump in your face and bite you. mom says snakes on a plane can really ruin your flight. that nice guy tried to help the people in the plane but there was too many snakes. mom says that guy's name is samuel el jackson. mom says samuel is a real men. anyway, he did his best to protect the people but snakes are very vicious creatures you know. you watch out for the snakes amazon.your frind kent"
3,Quick Delivery,"This blu-ray was delivered promptly. I hadn't seen the movie before ordering it. Didn't care for the film much, but the blu-ray quality is fine. I guess if you approach the film as comedic horror, you will enjoy it more."
4,Enjoyable and silly fun,"This is a great laugh, with some good action & quite a lot of gore. It's an enjoyably daft blockbuster with some scenes that go back to disaster movie cliches, but in an enjoyable way. Recommended.Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys"
4,Snakes On A Plane review,"[written: 26-08-06]I can actually say this movie was quite enjoyable. For one thing, you get to know the character's personalities a little better than in the movie 'United 93'. The visuals are spectacular, the suspense builds and you jump in your seat a few times too. Just the right number of people die so as it doesn't add up to a predictable fantasy where everyone is saved in the end. The only problem was the ending with the learning to surf scene. After all the panic and trauma on the plane, it seemed cheesy, falsely-sentimental and gooey and as if the whole snake drama had never happened. Also they leave a lot of questions unanswered which is kind of annoying.If you love plane drama movies then this is surely for you. I have seen just about every other disaster movie that involves passengers on a plane, and all have been about terrorists; so it was kinda nice to sit back and watch something a little less predictable and imaginative for once."
3,Absolutely Awful: I love it!,"I gave it three stars. Probably deserves a minus star, if there is such a thing. But, hey, I really love this film! It is absolutely ridiculous and terrible, but man, does it keep you going! Ain't boring, no way, that's for sure.If you just want out and out entertainment with absolutely no value, this is the film for you. It is just fun.I usually watch ummm...two films each day. Is that alot? Okay. Thing is, watching Snakes, time went by so quickly I didn't even realise the film was an hour and a half and almost over. Didn't reach for those chips or anything else. Just wanted to see the end. What I could never figure out is why the smart guys on the plane didn't turn the airconditioning up full blast just slow those suckers down. But then, there wouldn't have been a film, would there?This is no Oscar winner, but I'll bet it'll be a film you will watch over and over."
3,"An Enjoyable Film, 3 1/2 Stars, But not 5 star material","With the title ""Snakes on a Plane"" you know exactly what you are getting, which in fact is Snakes terrozing passangers on a plane. The plot is thin, the acting so-so (even Samual isnt that good here)yet...its a pretty enjoyable film with plenty of blood, thrills, and some T&A. Campy it is, and like I said its good and entertaining, but Five stars?? Hmm..I think those films go to academy award winning films and timless classics. Its enjoyable, but dont expect this outstanding or something you can watch over and over. Worth a rental or to catch it on Cable, but think its the best action/Thriller ever made is really streching it. ENJOY"
5,CAN'T MISS WITH SAMUEL!!,"GREAT MOVIE! LOTS OF ACTION, AND YOU CAN'T MISS WITH SAMUEL L. JACKSON. I HATE SNAKES, AND THIS ONE REALLY GIVES ONE THE CREEPS. THERE AREN'T MANY MOVIES THAT THIS MAN DOES THAT AREN'T GOOD. ENJOYABLE WATCHING FOR SURE!"
3,"Kitschy and over-the-top, but exactly what I expected","Snakes on a Plane is hilarious if you like kitschy, over-the-top movies. I mean, really, when you're on the run from the mob I think the last thing you would expect is for them to try to kill you by filling your plane with poisonous snakes. It's ingenious and I bet a lot of mob bosses are going to get ideas from this little gem of a film. It's also spectacularly overacted by Samuel L. Jackson and nice to see him in a role where he's not taking himself too seriously. Snakes on a Plane comes highly recommended from this connoisseur of trashy movies."
3,Snakes on a Plane is a lot of fun!,"Okay, this is a B movie so don't expect stellar storyline, acting, or any thoughts of this being a great movie. That said, it is a great campy B movie. It is so stupid and silly you can't help but laugh! And, Samuel Jackson is always fun to watch. The music is pretty kicking too!"
3,Superfly TNT Versus the Snakes,"What do you get when you mix a basket of serious, a bushell of B-movie, a dash of camp with an aircraft and a giant barrel of serpents?Oh, and also mix in the same character that Sam Jackson plays in every single movie that he's in...which is such a cool character; it just seems to work in everything he does from Pulp Fiction to Star Wars to S.W.A.T. to Snakes on a Plane.Add in Julianna Margulies and some actors you'll recognize and say to yourself, ""What did I just see him/her in?""Filter in Actor, Stuntman, Director David Ellis' strange concoction of serious/funny/ludicrous.Now, bake for 105 minutes. Let cool during goofy credit-rolling music video.Then help yourself to a tasty, entertaining heap of Snakes on a Plane."
1,Hokey as hell!!,This film tried to do something different and failed horribly. The FX are outlandishly bad and the plot was completley absurd. Samuel L. Jackson overacted a bit and while some of the cast was attractive the acting was mediocre at best. Dont wast your money and avoid this one folks...sorry.
1,Not bad enough to be good.,"This is a very badly made, low budget picture that happens to have Samuel L. Jackson in it. And, yes, there are scenes and lines so stupid they're mildly amusing. But it isn't worth the price of admission or your time. Watch it late night on the SciFi channel next month."
5,Wow,Amazing movie. i saw it yesterday and am going to see it today too. its one of my favorite movies go see it.
2,Not GOOD,"This Is A Boring movie, with some good moments (5%). the Acting is good, but the script is really bad. what happens with the Good Movies ?? 1.5 stars."
1,skip this dvd,"this is a dvd that were made out of all the bad scripts that been written since the 80's, if your old enough - lets say in early 30s late 20s you can remembre when every film back in the 80s had rambo in it. this is a wanna be as well. with snakes that attack people in places that no snake ever thought of. skip skip skip"
2,ONE OF THE WORST MOVIE OF THE YEAR!!!!,"Cant believe this junk went in theaters, Stupid scrip and cast with those lame & silly fat A*SS rapper body guards,they call themselves , saying bunch a silly & lame jokes doesn't do anything with the intense story & scrip ,Talking about play station, and Xbox when they wants to land the plane,In serious moments, bunch a horse sh**t and unbelievable B.S!!. NOT funny or scary! Just garbage!! .If u like this kind of suspense and airplane movie, watch ""RED EYE"" or ""FLIGHTPLAN"", with great scrip/cast and acting, Superior to this lame trash worth!!! D"
2,Terrible and awful sequences but what about the script?,"Films like this one makes us to reflect about the real future of Cinema, but far beyond the real hopes of the pioneers of the light and shadows, the immense legion of reminded filmmakers, the creator of the kinescope and a huge lot of people who still refuse to accept the movie must be a simple entertainment vehicle, and not a majestic expression of Art.This movie attempts against your intelligence, good taste and sensibility, kind reader. The edition process, the weakness of the script and the awful performances of all the cast, make of this film, one of the worst ones I have ever seen in years.In case you rent it or buy it, think it twice."
1,I saw the trailer...you gotta be kidding me?!?!? Is this movie for real?,"I saw the trailer for this movie when I went to see Clerks 2, which suprisingly is one of the funniest movies ive seen in a long time. When this trailer, for Snakes on a Plane, started, I thought it was one of those stupid psa's about having your cell phone turned off during the movie...the whole movie theater was laughing so hard I was still confused by the end of the trailer if this movie was for real or not and not some big sick joke.But no....this is a movie...that someone invested money in to have made...Funny thing is it'll make a crapload of money and people will walk away loving it.I've officially given up on the movie industry. I surrender. You beat me. There is no more hope."
5,Check Your Brain At The Door,"This movie runs a little less than two hours but manages to cram every action/disaster/horror movie cliche in the book in that running time. If you are over the age of 30, you will feel as if you've seen this movie a hundred times and yet, for all that, familiarity does NOT breed contempt. The movie is hardly a spoof, or camp, but you do get that >>wink<< every now and then from the cast, who's in on the joke.After you get past the perfunctory setup story, it's all action with a whole buncha OH S**T! moments. The concept that one could get 500 snakes on a plane is ludicrous, (especially considering only a handful of snakes are indigenous to hawaii, none of them poisonous) but if you let rational thinking like that get in your way, you're just NOT going to like this film so stay home."
3,I have seen better...,"I admit the idea was original, but the whole behaviour of the snakes on the plane as well as miraculous survival of the protagonists are simple too far away from reality.Without Samuel L. Jackson it would be just one star, at least he contributes some entertainment to this movie.It`s a nice popcorn-flick, don`t try to think too much, then you will probably enjoy it."
2,Laughs on a Plane,"The latest in high-concept filmmaking, ""Snakes on a Plane"" has more laughs than ""Airport 1975."" Samuel L. Jackson isn't taking things too seriously as he blows away deadly snakes while unleashing some profanity-laden dialogue. Schlocky visual effects, gratuitous sex and a ridiculous climax make this perfect drive-in fodder."
1,Mess on a plane.,I won't waste anymore time on this film schlock. I will just tell you that it was two hours of my life that could have been better spent elsewhere. I would have rather spent two hours wading in a dirty pool that toddlers had peed in. Samuel L Jackson must had needed some milk money starring in this mess. All I have to say is please avoid this mess like a class 5 tornado.
2,Would have rated it one star if it wasn't funny,"This is a terrible movie from begining to the end. The plot sucks, the acting is terrible, and the digital snake attacks were awful also. The only plus about this movie is it is comical when the fake snakes kill the people on the plane. I am starting to think Sam Jackson doesn't read the scripts before he takes on a movie. This movie along with freedomland were atrocious!!!!! Only watch this movie if you absolutely nothing else to do!!!!!!"
3,cold of been better but still good,the day iwent htere people in the coud wer laughingmore than jumping and ther was a few things i was expecting but it still kept my attention for action kind of like calling it anoconda in outer space or anocondas off grounds it was decent to me
1,Trash can,"After the first 15 minutes of this film, I threw it in the trash can. Overacted and ridiculous."
2,ridiculous and hilarious,"terrible screenplay, very bad acting. samuel jackson wearing his trademark leather sports jacket even in humid hawaii? bitten by poisonus snakes some died so fast, some, like that kid, so hard to die? this is supposed to be a suspensful thriller, but why so many people laughed in the theatre? because it's a stupid and funny movie with so many cliches, no matter dialogue or the plot. cliches, cliches, and cliches. jackson's stereotyped acting is also very tiresome."
4,"Fun, fun, fun","With a title like Snakes on a Plane, it's pretty clear what you are in for. This film delivers in spades. Vicious, venomous snakles from around the world are attracted to phermones planted in the leis on a trip from Hawaii to LA. Boy, do those pheromones make them vicious. Some very gory and some very funny snake attacks here. Maybe it should be called Cousin of Willard? Anyway, this one brings some gross-out thrills and hillarious comic moments. The amazing Samuel J. gives us his Samuel J. best. A real saturday afternoon type thriller. Just plain fun!"
2,Not so good,"I wanted to see this when it hit the theatre but I could not get anyone to go with me due to their fear of snakes. Instead, I waited till it came out on dvd and bought it thinking it would be good. I wish I would have rented it first instead because I would not have bought it. The movie is O.K. but not worth spending the money to own it."
4,Are you Ophiophobic?,"This movie really pushes the button of ""fear of snakes"" to the extreme. This movie was a horror flick and a comedy all on one. It does have it's laughs and scarey moments. But what this movie really does work on is the peoples' fear of being ""trapped"" and something that they fear most ""snakes"". Probably what would have been worse is spiders. I did like this movie but what made it unbelievable for me is the drug lord trying to kill the witness with snakes. You would think that he would have planted a bomb instead, but the snakes worked for fear factor. If you want to watch a fun horror film then see this one. I do recommend this film to anyone that is ophiophobic."
3,"Entertaining enough, but far from great","I don't know quite what to make of this film. It goes from a drama to comedy to action. I say comedy, because most of the scenes involving the snakes are more humorous than anything. Other than Samuel L. Jackson's role, the acting was terrible (annoying at times). However, despite this fact, the movie did keep my interest. Just don't expect a great action film or a horror flick. This is neither."
4,"A Fun Movie (And Better Than What People Expected, For Better or Worse)","The biggest problem with Snakes on a Plane is that it isn't a bad movie.The hype of the film centered around the title. ""Snakes on a Plane."" That title works because it's so... well... straight-forward about how B-movie bad it's going to be. But this movie doesn't deliver on its promise. Sure, it's still B-movie-ish, but it's not poorly done. The acting, effects, writing, suspense, etc., all work.So, ironically, people might be disappointed with this movie because it's better than its title might lead you to expect. If you enter with relatively few expectations, you'll likely enjoy it."
4,Snakes on a Plane,"When a young man witnesses a brutal mob murder, it falls to FBI agent Neville Flynn to escort his charge safely from Hawaii to Los Angeles to testify. But in an act of self-preservation, the crime boss facing prison smuggles hundreds of poisonous snakes onto the commercial aircraft in a crate timed to release its deadly cargo halfway over the Pacific. Flynn, along with a frightened flight crew and passengers, must then band together in a desperate attempt to survive. Very impressive movie. I guarantee you that after you see this movie, you are going to be scared of snakes."
3,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A much-hyped film which turned out to be much ado about nothing, Snakes on a Plane delivers exactly what it promises (stupid ""so bad it's good"" filmmaking and Airport-style camp) and so is not really worth recommending or not recommending: it's bad, but it's up to you to decide if it's bad in a good way or bad in a bad way."
3,MF'ing snakes on a mf'ing plane,"It wasn't as good as I thought, but Samuel L. Jackson is cool, so I would still recommend it. The problem with this movie was that there were three or four really campy scenes put in just to get cheap laughs. Unfortunately, these cheap laughs are so ridiculous that the pull you out of the suspense of the movie. If you like Samuel, it is worth watching, although I thought his part should have been bigger."
2,snakes!,"It is not believable, the HD is bar none, the CG is laughable, and the acting is sad at best."
2,"Fun, but not a good film.","After seeing this movie, I was actually suprised. The movie did a good job setting up the characters and Samuel L. Jackson did a decent job as the lead role. The snakes were a little dissapointing and it was easy to tell they were CGI. Although predictible and somewhat lame, it was a fun movie that was a nice watch on a hot summer day."
4,Snakes all Good,"this was a good movie, Man if a snake came out on plane like that when I'm up there, then i would do anything to get off of that plane.Samuel jackson was great in the movie, he took care of them snakes."
2,Worth watching 100 minutes for one lousy line?,"I don't have a problem with movies that require you to switch off your brain as long as they're entertaining. Everybody knows that the premise of the movie and the script are horrible...heck, the producers probably wanted it to be this way. The movie wasn't entertaining in the least though. There's pretty much only one scene in the entire movie which might cause some excitement (Bad Mofo Samuel has to turn on the a/c) but that's about it. Other than that people are bitten in various areas and some folks die.To recap...this movie isn't so bad that it's good...it's so bad that it is unbelievably bad."
2,BORINNNGGGG,"Most movies of this type should have at least some measure of believability. This movie has none from start to finish.(To be honest here, I couldn't make it to the finish)I found it boring, and what part of the plot required exposed breasts and ""sex acts"" I don't know. Maybe to keep interest in this yawner. I tried to watch it because of Samuel L. Even he couldn't save it. Oh Samuel, where have you gone?"
3,Not as good as my mylanta,"It doesn't work as well as mylanta, and it also is very gritty!The taste is fine, but the sany taste stays with you for a long time after chewing."
3,good enough,"the term ""you get what you pay for"" certainly applies to this product. i have not noticed overwhelming results similiar to that of the more exspensive NO2 products, but im not disapointed in what has happend either. A major con is the fact that i have noticed occasional headaches but is goes away with proper hydration-end result-good enough for price especially during thie recession"
3,Not too bad for the price,"Pros:- Cheap- For the price, works decentlyCons:- causes gas, like an absurd amount of gas."
2,practically a placebo,"Only used this for a short period, never saw any real affect its practically a placebo. Get a pre workout powder shake it will be better, don't get pills they don't work as fast as a solution."
3,Good Book on the Small Ship Navy.,"This paperback has stood up to several decades of use. It is an excellent collection of data and photographs of the Minesweepers and Armed yachts of the USN in WWII. While it contains no service records of the vessels concerned, it has many technical readouts of a very varied collection of very necessary ships. No WWII navy got by without buying and requistioning a collection of Yachts, many of which performed valuable roles in the naval war. In addition, it also contains the readouts of the Minesweepers of the USN. A minesweeper is a minimal ship, whose purpose is to find and render useless a very ugly naval weapon. They didn't get much glory, but they did save many lives. Sadly you don't get any deck plans, and there is no index, but a lot of good stuff is found between these covers."
3,It is what it is....,"Good arrangements of well known songs to celebrate our great country. Reasonable, although not exceptional, price. Would definitely consider other CD's in this series. Would be happy to purchase from this vendor again."
5,Inspirational,"Trinh Do is my hero. The story of his life in Communist Vietnam and of his escape is a testament to the his determination, perseverance and inner strength.He and his parents displayed amazing resilience in the face of despicable conditions imposed by the corrupt regime. I greatly admire Trihn's:* Dedication to his intellectual and scholastic development* Determination in single-handedly toiling on the family farm to stave off starvation* Moral fortitude in the face of daily bombardment from communist propaganda* Courage during the terrifying escapeAt the risk of seeming trite, I must say that Trinh's tenacity in the face of horrendous situations is my inspiration. When I am feeling sorry for myself, or when a task seems overwhelming, remembering Trinh's story refreshes my perspective.Life is good. I will persevere."
5,Comunist Reality 101,"Trinh Do's account of daily life after the war is a shocking eye opener for those who are blessed enough not to have live under communist rule. A story of pain, hardship and the will to survive at all cost. The eternal love and sacrifices parents give to their children. A must read for all the ages."
5,The Listening Side of Prayer,"This book opened my eyes to the other side of prayer. We sometimes, get so wrapped up in asking the Lord for things, that we fail to stop and just ""truly"" listen for the answer. I cherish this book and recommend it to everyone."
1,What a let down.,"I've read F. Paul Wilson's books in the past and always found them to be an excellent read so I bought this older one. Reading the back of the book it sounded really interesting. It was not. It drug on and on. It was boring. It was amateurish. But, I stuck with it (speed reading) because I was curious how it ended. What a stupid ending!! This book was one big waste of time and I highly recommend NOT reading it."
4,Great Album. Introspective and honest. BUT NOT FOR GROOVE'N.,"This album is very compeling, but I was expecting something different. The first song I ever heard by Morel was ""True"" which is pretty house/dance driven but the rest of the album doesn't really fit with that genre. This album is very broody and has a much more intimate appeal than your typical ""dance"" record. I guess it was marketed differently. If you are thinking about buying this album with the idea of getting your groove on, you might have too look elsewhere."
1,Morel Should Stick to Remixing,"Morel is best known as a remixer and co-producer of remixes with internationally famous DJ group Deep Dish. He has been featured on remixes of artists like Madonna, Tori Amos and Tina Turner - and he should stick to it. The man can't sing, he can't write songs or lyrics to save his life; he comes off as a middle aged butch homosexual with nothing to say, but a desperate dream to be a rock star. It's a shame he abandoned the projects by now-popular undground artists like Easter Bradford and Kala Azim because even though his production of their music had the same generic house/rock sound, at least they could sing and had something to say in their lyrics. Do yourself a favour and seek their material out instead."
2,Please this is game is not that good,i bought season ticket baseball 2003 and that game is so awesome i have never played a game better then that i am on my 3rd season and i have coached every game plus did all of the general manager options through over 400 games now and still love it.BUT SEASON TICKET FOOTBALL is missing something. 1st why couldnt they make it just like stb2003. there is no career mode no hall of fame and the whole set up is just terrible. i am not going to waste my time talking about anymore i am just going to say I SURE HOPE SEASONT TICKET BASKETBALL IS ALOT DAMN BETTER THEN FOOTBALL. but i will tell u all u cant go wrong with the baseball game it is so damn SWEEEET!
1,Horrible,This is horrible its like a free game you would find on download.com. I loved the Season Ticket Baseball series but this was horrible its not even from the same developer. Its totally different from Season Ticket Baseball. I like football better then Baseball so I couldn't wait to get it. I got it and it was horrible!
1,Much less than expected,"If you bought Season ticket 2003 Baseball and expected the football version to be similar, you will be severely diappointed. It is a very poor game, no consistency, no GM features, nothing like the basbeall version which is a wonderful product"
1,In one word- junk.,"Season Ticket Football, is just like it sister game, Season Ticket Baseball. Both games are poor. The only person who would like this game would be someone who loves to see nothing but charts in a game. This game is terrible because teams and players are made up. So you really don't know who any of the players are, and you don't know if they're any good. If you want to make a trade, you never heard of the opposing players either. So you don't know if you got a good deal or a bad deal. The only kid of person who'd want this game is a person who likes text instead of graphics for the game, enjoys watching players he never heard of, and also likes games that have no sound support. So don't waste 20 bucks on this junk. And if you do buy it, I warned you."
5,Excellent Research!,"Another excellent work by Van Sertima! He investigates information from several disciplines to examine Pre-Columbian America. His notes/references are extensive as usual. Early America Revisited should be in every library, if not in every High School history classroom, right beside They Came Before Columbus...."
5,Just as described..,"Great deal on a metal knife strip for people that don't want a wooden one. My husband actually attached it to our pot rack which is above the stove and it is very convenient to reach for the knives. We arent using the metal hooks, but I imagine they would be convenient if we needed them. Holds about 10 knives of various sizes."
1,Will not tighten down against wall,"If I can still find the box for this, it's going back. One of the cheap wall anchors, with no lip on it, fell back into the wall. Tried different anchors, it simply won't screw all the way in and hold it tight with the magnetic strip in place. We've been trying to mount this thing for an hour and no dice. A wiggly, insecure holder for knives? No thanks."
5,Nice product,"This magnetic knife holder is: easy to install, convenient, sturdy, space saving, nice to look at."
5,very nice product,"After I got this book, I immediately went to the piano and learned it. The print is very clear and easy to read. And the cover is nice and pleasure while looking at it. I'm very happy with this product. Thanks."
2,Missed my party.,"I ordered this item to wear to a christmas party on Dec. 9th, paid extra shipping for 2-3 business days. My item arrived two days after the day of my event and I had to miss it as a result. This item fit nicely and was true to size,however the quality of the fabric was fair at best. I was very upset to have missed my party after paying extra for express shipping, I did not know this item shipped from China or I would have chosen differently."
1,meh,the raven short was ok... if the selling price is over $5 save your money... or at least see it before you buy it. its on netflix.
1,The suckitude was immense,"If you are a fan of ""Rock and Roll Nightmare,"" avoid this title like the plague. I have a very high tolerance for bad B movies, but this movie disappointed me. Yep, compared to the schlockfest that was ""Rock and Roll Nightmare,"" this was terrible. How do you make a sequel to a bad movie shot in a week with the producers friends for $50,000 and turn out a grossly inferrior product? I love B movies, but this made me want to sue to get the 90 minutes of my life back. I had low expectations for ""Rock and Roll Nightmare,"" but it was very enjoyable in a ""Plan 9"" kind of way. I did not expect ""Citizen Cain,"" but this movie had me longing for the production values of ""Manos"" or ""Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-a-Rama,"" or even ""Rock and Roll Nightmare."" Even if you are a fan of B movies, please avoid this. It really hurts."
1,Terrible,"This movie is woeful.The first movie was a bad movie, but so bad, it was good. This is just bad.Boring and with no charm. I would give this 0/10 if possible."
5,great book,"It is a great book, very easy to understand, the author, Richard Rogers sets clear and useful examples, some built and others still in proyect but yet explains step by step."
3,Great texture but scent was too strong,The oil rubbed on very nicely and felt very smooth (the perfect consistency for a massage oil). However the scent was so strong that it became distracting. It also seemed to be a more masculine scent than what my wife was wanting. We are going to get another bottle of the same brand just a different scent.
5,Great Product,This is the best massage oil I have used. It is very light and the smell is very light. It has a light almond smell that does not linger. It is absorbed by the body very nicely and I love how it feels on my hands when I am massaging. If you buy this oil start out using a small amount until you can regulate the amount you need to use each time.
3,First Time Buyer...,"I've only recently started buying online and am surprised at all the quality products I have found among them Kama Sutras body oils my fiancee and my self found this product vary relaxing and easy to use it also gave a vary pleaseing scent and was non sticky after its use,would we buy this product again I can speak for both of us and give a outstanding YES to Kama Sutra and there line of quality products..."
5,Wonderful!,"This massage oil is great. I get hour and a half massages every month, a bottle lasts about a year and a half. Great Stuff!"
3,Scented?,"I was under the impression this oil was supposed to have a romantic scent. Unfortunately, it actually smells more like burnt hair... like when someone is doing a perm... it's pretty bad. The oil itself is quite nice however. You just have to plug your nose. I do suggest this brand of oil, it is a very nice blend and feels great on the skin, but please pick one with another scent or one that isn't scented at all. Compared with Ky warming massage oil, this is a better oil in my opinion. Also much better than kama sutra edible massage oils, but it has almost no taste. The edible massage oils aren't very good tasting either though... and they are very sticky (they are water based and seem to use carbohydrates to increase viscosity)."
2,a flowery massage,I was just looking for some massage oil...if you do not mind strong smelling flowers this oil is pretty good. I had to purchase unscented oil to mix with it...it is just to strong scented
4,Washes right out!,"Kama Sutra makes high quality products for enhancing your love life. You can get their massage oils on anything and it washes right out. The large size a little much for most of our customers, so we only sell the smaller size one at a time. Customers love Kama Sutra products and we will continue to sell them in our romantic room packages on our Uberoom website."
1,Contains corn,"On the packaging it says: ""Other ingredients: none. Contains corn."" If you want to avoid (GMO?) corn when you take vitamin C, don't buy this product. It should be mentioned in the product description.The 454 gram bottle effectively contains 90 servings of 4 gr of vitamin C, which total 360 gram. This means that the remaining 94 gram or almost 20% of this product is corn.I am getting near the end of the bottle and there are a lot of yellowish granules in the powder, the product generally tastes bitter and acidic (i.e. is not well-buffered), and it doesn't dissolve all that well in water, half just sinks to the bottom.If you are low on a budget, don't worry about the ingredients, and take it to improve bowel movements, this product might do it for you. Otherwise, go with something else."
5,How can the general public cope with threats of terrorism?,"How can the general public cope with threats of terrorism and crime? Still The Target examines issues of protecting high level individuals and how these strategies can be used by corporations, private individuals, and governments alike. Case studies, research findings, and the authors' CIA backgrounds blend to reveal methods of observation, self-defense, and even attack. The focus on a proactive attitude makes Still The Target an intriguing and highly recommended guide."
3,Okay MP3 Player,"I bought this mp3 player almost five years ago for my mother who isn't very knowledgeable with technology but wanted something small to fit in her pocket when she is listening to music. She still uses it, and even though she's had a few issues with the songs not progressing when she hits fast forward, and the battery cover no longer stays on so she tapes it shut. It always fit into my computer's USB drive, so I've never had an issue with that. It's not a fancy mp3 player in the least, but it still plays music after 4.5 years."
1,Bad Product,"This product's hardrive would not work after 4 days of use. It would shut off after being on pause for more then a minute. I wrote to the company and they were no help at all. I do not recommend this product, because it is not worth the time to return."
5,A Day in Mossy Creek,"I first read this book on my Kindle, and then purchased copies of the entire series for my book loving friends. Each chapter is delightful, entertaining, and it left me wishing that there were more at the end of the series. I would highly recommend this book and the others for anyone enjoying a light, fun read. Norma Webber"
5,Wonderful,Very nice and enjoyable read. The series is even though writen by different authors flows from chapter to chapeter. Read it!
5,Great series,"All of the Mossy Creek books are thoroughly enjoyable. My husband has also enjoyed them, and we have lots of chuckles over references to Mossy Creek characters."
4,Spiritual Classics -12 Disciplines and so much more,"I lead a Sunday School group of 20- and 30-somethings. While the book is set up primarily as an individual, daily devotional, it works wonderously in a group setting. The ideas collected under each discipline led to some thoughtful discussions. I only devoted 3 Sunday's to the book; but, we could have spent three times that many discussing the issues presented.Taken as a whole (now that's I've read the book a second time) the WAY in which I approach worship and my faith in general, has been GREATLY enhanced. This is one of those books that reveals something new every time I read from it."
5,Classics for enquiring mnds,"Our study group ""The Enquiring Minds"" finds this book ideal for group study. Especially helpful is the wide range of diversity both in content and contributors. Each chapter provides stimulating discussion material that is varied enough to remain interesting over an extended period."
3,The book's essays are not in favor of stem cell reserach,"The book Stem Cell Research: New Frontiers in Science and Ethics by Nancy E. is a collection of essays produced at the 2001 symposium, titled with the same name. This symposium attracted over 70 scientists, philosophers and theologians from across the United States for the three-day event. The idea of the symposium sponsors (Milwaukee's Marquette University, the Archdiocese of Milwaukee and the Madison-based Wisconsin Catholic Conference) was to discuss and educate about the scientific ethical and public policy implications of stem cell research.In my opinion, the essays were chosen because of what I think is affinity with the author and/or symposium's sponsor ideas. It will be nice if we could hear the other side of the story"
4,interesting info,Had seen documentaries on this and have a friend who loves teh song. I bought this as a gift for her and she found it very informative
5,OUTSTANDING,"I purchased this video right after it came out, and placed it in my church library. It is an excellent history of probably the most famous hymn ever written. There audio clips from MANY singers who have sung it well, and some who butchered it (lovingly). If you are a music buff, a Bill Moyers fan, or a child of the 60s who loved Judy Collins' version, you'll love this video!"
5,These CDs have presence,"These CDs address the issue of how to EXPERIENCE the shift in consciousness that Eckhart describes as ""being"", as opposed to compulsive thinking (which is the baseline for most of us). As he explains on the tape, the words are not what is important, rather it is the experience of ""being"". People often describe an advancement in understanding that can occur in the presence of someone who is enlightened. This same benefit or ""presence"" can be felt when listening to these CDs. If one is not connecting with the experience, then the words alone have little meaning (and the pauses and laugh can be annoying) which may explain the discrepancy in the reviews so far. If you have read and connected with the book, ""The Power of Now"", I cannot recommend these CDs highly enough. If you haven't read the book, you're missing one of the greatest books of this century."
5,Actually this is one of MY favorites,"I am a HUGE Eckhart Tolle fan and longtime student of his work. This particular 2-cd set is one of my very favorites, As an animal lover I adore listening to his section about animals and what amazing teachers they are. This particular set is very deep and I have gotten more from it each time I listen to it. He actually leads you through enlightenment exercises...ahhh, thank you, Eckhart!"
2,He's got much better,"I've listened to other Tolle audiobooks and this one is very weak. Don't buy this, it's a waste of your money. The audiobook is simply a recording (and a very poor one at that) of a partial section of a live workshop. The content does not flow like his other professionally produced a-books. In addition, the microphone is too close and you hear every breath and guteral sound (very annoying).I really loved Power of Now, but this is junk. Shame on Tolle for hustling his faithful customer base with this garbage."
2,John Adams and the American Revolution,"I;ve already entered one review which specified that the book I ordered was not the one delivered. Ordered was a hard copy version of a book but what was sent was a paperback version in very poor condition. Let it suffice to say that I expected a hard bound version. That I got a paperback version, with pages yellowed and falling from the binding, and for a discount of four dollars is not what I expected. I hope this review meets the minimum reqirements for feedback. If you order a hard bound book , you should get one."
3,First Time Read Cynthia Victor,"Consequences is the first book I've read by Cynthia Victor. Although this book started out fast at first, it slowed down to where it just seemed to drag on. It was one of those books that I could have read or left. It didn't impress me that much. I felt it skipped a lot of important information, such as Page and Simon's relationship. Who knows, maybe I was expecting more romance than this novel had to offer. All in all though I couldv'e left this book on the shelf."
1,Reads Like a Legal Obligation,"Professor Ray Atlee and his brother Forrest are summoned back to their father's home. Their father is the imposing Judge Reuben Atlee and he's dying. Ray arrives to find the judge dead and to find several million dollars in cash. Should Ray share the money with his drug-abusing brother? Should Ray keep the money? Who knows the money is there and what are they willing to do to get their hands on it?Unfortunately, finding the answers to these questions requires reading the book. And the book is not worth reading. While Grisham once again writes a highly readable, southern inflected legal drama, this one lacks enough plot to justify its 200 and some pages. Simply stated, very little happens and what does happen is belabored and not entirely convincing. It reads, quite frankly, like Grisham is fulfilling a legal obligation to produce a novel.It may be worth noting that this book contains some connections to other Grisham novels, including A Time to Kill."
3,GET SUMMONED...,"The Summons, is different from any other Grisham book from the point of view and approach, but it always envolved people of the LAW and misterious suspense cases and misteries to be solved, although it's not as entertaineing as other Grisham books, this story does shows that Grisham could take a different look and portrait a story of law different from his previous works. The Summons it's not an easy to liked book but is not a boring and dull write, it's very intelligent and detailist, although the end is suspected it leaves you wondering, was next..."
3,The Money Game,"The Summons by John Grisham is a fiction mystery This is the first book that I am reading by this author. It's about a well known judge by the name of Reuben Atlee in a small town of Mississippi. The judge summoned both of his sons Ray and Forrest to come back and dicuss his estate, instead death comes along for Reuben and he leaves a lot of secerts behide. Ray finds the secert and is depspreatly trying to hide it from everyone even his brother. Although, this is my first John Grisham book I enjoy the way each chapter is filled with suspense and mystery. I really like the way he writes, erevything seems like it could happen. Once you read this book you'll never forget what happens."
4,!!!!SweetSummons!!!!,"The book, Summons, is written by John Grisham, I like this book because there is action in the first 30 pages. I don't like books that have action or some kind of a thrill until you are half way thru the book. If you like books that keep you waiting and wondering what is going to happen, then this is for you. This story talks a lot about Forrest's and his dad's problem, but it is very interesting. My favorite character is ""Ray"", because he likes to keep things to himself, but if something needs to be said he is not afraid to say it.Will Ray tell Forrest what he has been hiding from him? Find out by reading The Summons you will be surprised, I was!"
1,I can't belive John Grisham wrote this book!,"I have read all of John Grisham's books, and generally like his writing, with the exception of one or two. ""The Summons"" was one of the most boring, tedious books I have ever read. I thought I would never get done reading it. Did John Grisham really write it???????"
5,"Author of Unusual Destiny Says: Yum, Classic Grisham!","A reversal of fortune tale in triplicate: Ray Atlee is a professor of law at the University of Virginia, brother to a sometimes-reformed addict and the son of a highly respected but terminally ill Mississippi Judge. Summoned to his ancestral home, Ray enters his father's library expecting the old man to reveal his final wishes. Instead, he finds his father dead on a sofa that is barely concealing over three million dollars in neatly stashed cash. To preserve his father's reputation Ray searches for the origin of the suspect booty and tries to protect his brother from himself. Tempted, threatened, followed and framed, Ray takes to the air, the roads and the waters of the old south. This reader was happy to ride along. A great read."
2,I wanted to like it...,"I really wanted to like this book. It was an incredibly fast read, due in part to the load of dialog. The story had a good start, but nothing exciting really happened. And the ending left me shouting ""that's IT?"""
2,Very Disappointing,"I thought Grisham had turned around his recent slump with A Painted House, but The Summons is just plain BORING. A cute ending in the last ten pages is not worth yawning through the 331 pages it takes to get there."
1,The Summons is a disappointment,The Summons is the work of a man who has achieved success with his early books because of the commitment that he made to the reader to provide exciting and intellectual thrillers that you didn't want to quit reading. The Summons is the antithesis. It is the writing of a man that has other interests in life and is more concerned about the revenues from the book rather than the quality of the storyline. There was never a moment where I was excited about reading this book. Do not waste your time.
3,Not up to par,"The Summons is an entertaining story but it is just not up to the standard of most of John Grisham's other books. The Summons is OK, a story more about the brother's relationship than any mystery or crime or legalities. I found it much more predictable than any of his other works.The characters are a bit shallow and not very sympathetic.I found myself not caring too much about any of them or what the outcome was.It was an easy read but just not the page turner I always look forward to from Grisham.The Summons could have been a lot better, in my opinion, with a few more twists and turns. A good romance might have helped it along, also. With only 3 minor women characters, it was all about men! JG usually writes for both sexes but this one was a major male novel.If you have read all his other books, I think you will be disappointed with this one. If you haven't, you might enjoy it alot more!"
3,Grisham has become stagnent,"Having read all of Mr. Grisham's novels, it appears he now has lost the compassion to give us that extra effort of his earlier novels. The Summons can't hold up to the effort put forth in A Time to Kill, or The Pelican Brief. Starting with the Brethern, his effort appears to be half-hearted. Has he run out of ideas or the desire to write? I hope not."
2,Disappointing,"I don't know if the real John Grisham is ""back"" or not. This seemed like a half-hearted attempt at a legal thriller for a man who has given us such great books in the past. There is no real courtroom drama here. Readers who loved such books as The Firm and A Time to Kill for their complexity and attention to detail will be particularly disappointed. Grisham makes hard to really care one way or the other about the characters because the development is not as deep as in past books. The plot twists at which Grisham is usually so adept seem contrived in this book (what few plot twists there are). Still, people who really, really enjoy Grisham will still find some value in this book. But, if you are new to Grisham--go back and buy A Time to Kill and start from the beginning."
2,Cookie Cut out copy,"There is nothing original or unpredictable about ""The Summons"". The ending is obvious from the first paragraph of the jacket summary. Grisham's attempt to capture the mood and atmosphere of the south reads like a comic book version of a Pat Conroy novel, a very poor imitation of the real thing."
2,Disappointing,"It seems as though Grisham had a deadline to meet ... and fast. Usually Grisham makes his characters deeper and he is fantastic in the courtroom and with attorneys. However, in this book you receive neither in depth.It was a far-fetched story line to begin with. What was so disappointing was the ending of the book. Again, it seems as though a deadline had to be met and fast."
4,In the money!,"This book has taken a fair bit of flack by reviewers and I feel that they're being a bit harsh on the author. It's certainly a smaller book than he usually writes and lighter in content but I've given it 4 stars for being a smooth and interesting read...not everything has to be heavy and punchy. Ray Atlee, a professor of law at a southern university, is summoned home by his distatorial father, a prominent judge who was never able to astablish a rapport with his two sons.On finding his father dead on the sofa of his living room, Ray also discovers $3 million in notes, packed into boxes. He decides not to tell his brother Forrest of his find immediately as Forrest is a drug addict who would almost certainly kill himself with drink and drugs.Ray then sets out to discover where the money came from and enters a world of big money with all of its attendant risks."
2,Not as good as other Grisham books,"I was disappointed by this book. John Grisham is one of my favorite authors and I look forward to reading his books. This one was slow in the beginning and most of the way through. The ending was ok but not great, I felt it was incomplete.The Summons is not as good as his others. This one did not have much in the way of building the characters, the only interesting one was Harry Rex.It did not seem like such an interesting story. So Ray Atlee gets a summons from his dying father and when he gets there his father is already dead and he finds $3 million. He then spends most of the time trying to hide the money..."
2,The Least Entertaining Grisham Novel,"I have read every Grisham novel and always buy them without even perusing them first. I guess I will have to examine them more closely in the future. This book features a sketchy plot that seems to ramble along wishfully looking to pick up our interest with very few developments. I read it to the end, hoping for a redeeming climax, but ....."
1,Grisham's worst ever!,"With The Summons, I have read all of John Grisham's books up to date. And unfortunately I had to struggle through this book because the plot began to develop and get interesting after two-thirds had already been read. The first couple hundred pages it's as if you're just reading Ray Atlee's live his life. There is absolutely nothing in there. Then the ending...actually what ending? It was so loosely fabricated that I think Grisham just weaved something together on the spur of the moment then called it quits.A very disappointing read. My suggestion is if you're interested in reading the book, borrow it from the library. Don't waste your money buying it."
2,"Great character development, but where was the story?","John Grisham certainly knows how to draw you into a character's life. I could read about the main character, Ray Atlee, all day (and I did), but this story is lacking plot, details... I was very disappointed by the lack of mystery, thrill, and legal expertise usually found in a John Grisham book. The story has many holes, and the ending is (much)less than exciting. When I finished the book, I was actually upset that I had wasted so many hours reading it."
2,Better Look for a Day Job,"This was definately not Mr. Grisham's finest work. It seems like a classic ""formula"" book that was written more for the bucks than for the bang. It is very readable, but you will be left wondering if you might have better occupied your time. If this was his first, it would have been his last."
1,What's happened to Grisham?,"I've loved this author's earlier books, but is he turning out to be like so many who turn out a good novel or two, then, in order to keep the$ coming in, churns out new ones even when they're not worth reading? In earlier novels I have always admired a certain, admittedly far-fetched, logic to the unravelling of the story. Don't look for that in this one. We begin to understand why the protagonist's wife decided to leave him abruptly sometime in the past. His actions are so unreasonable as to stretch credulence. As others have said, it IS a page-turner, and the faster the pages turn, the better. The rather predictable ""surprise"" ending just dribbles away to a conclusion, with nothing there. In short, check this book out of the library if you've got to have something to read for a summer trip, but don't expect much."
1,Is Mr. Grisham even writing his own books anymore?,"The only reason I am even giving it one star is because, for whatever reason, I managed to finish the book. I was tempted to put it aside after many a droning chapter with characters that i could find no redeeming qualities in. I couldn't bring myself to care about Ray, who is pretty much a dud. This book wastes a lot of time getting to any action and I feel like Grisham knows we will buy his books, so why bother making them exciting and intricately plotted as his early works were? In spite of the massively ungood (to be kind)book ""The Bretheren,"" I picked this up and am now disappointed to no longer be able to garauntee myself an exciting read when I pick up one of his books with confidence from a rack without even reading the back or any reviews. I hate having to lose an author from my list of favorites."
5,WOW!,Grisham does it again. The legal thriller is taken to a new level in this vivid novel with many twists and turns. A Grisham fan's dream come true.
1,The Summons,I have read all of Grisham's books and this one was extremely disappointing! I don't read Grisham for a moral and that's what I got! I kept waiting for something to happen and it just dragged on and on!! I was actually angry at the end. I felt very cheated.
2,DISAPPOINTING,I HAVE READ MOST OF JOHN GRISHAM'S BOOKS AND I MUST SAY THIS ONE REALLY DISAPPOINTED ME. THE CHARACTERS WERE NOT THAT INTERESTING AND THE PLOT WAS PREDICTABLE AND THE ENDING WAS TERRIBLE. READ ONLY IF YOU FEEL LIKE WASTING TIME.
2,Writing for Profit,"THE SUMMONS is not up to what we expect from Grisham. Definite feeling he had to fulfill his contract with the publisher and dashed something off. The characters, with the exception of Harry Rex, were poorly developed. The idea of Forrest, a drug addict, turning away from 3 million dollars as a ""test"" for his brother just wasn't credible.Hopefully Grisham will wait until he has the time to develop a heart stopper like THE FIRM or THE CLIENT before publishing again."
4,Things Are Not As They Appear,"People are never as simple as they appear. Ray Atlee is a UVA law professor in his mid-forties, recovering from a nasty divorce. His brother, Forrest, provides black sheep with a good name.Their father, a sickly, scrupulous judge living in Mississippi, issues a call for both of his sons to appear, but the audience never takes place. The judge dies before he can relate what is on his mind.Rummaging through his papers, Ray discovers the old man had a secret. Its unwinding makes for a great tale."
1,Very Dissapointing,"For someone who has been a huge Grisham fan for years, I was looking forward to reading another of his legal thrillers. This might be one of the most boring books ever. It never grips you, you reach the last few pages of the books and realize the story has not even begun to be interesting and the book is over. It is probably fifty levels below any of his other legal thrillers. I am not sure if this is even a book or just some ramblings that are the outline and backdrop for a story,"
2,A Time To Kill,"How disappointing. I didn't think Grisham was capable of writing anything worse than ""Skipping Christmas."" If this were his first book then I wouldn't be as critical but this just doesn't stack up to his other great works and wouldn't sell if his name weren't on it.I've read all of his books and even appreciated his departure from his legal writing in ""Painted House;"" but I can't recommend that anyone read ""The Summons."" Unfortunately, this may be the last Grisham book I read."
1,A Serial Not a Novel,"I love Grisham. However, this book is really only a chapter in a serial. The ending really doesn't resolve anything..only sets up the next novel.Where is the real DRAMA?Grisham can do a lot better. I would take a pass on this one"
4,A thriller but no courtroom drama,"The Summons was supposed to signal John Grisham's return to the legal thriller. There are few courtroom scenes, but many lawyers. Rather Grisham's latest tackles human character. What would you do if you came home, found your father dead and $3 million sitting in the corner? That's the plot that entraps protagonist Ray Atlee.Greed and how a human handles the opportunity for sudden wealth has been a staple in some of Grisham's works (ie, Runaway Jury). While there is no big court case here, Grisham puts Ray and his brother Forrest on trial in real life. It produces a not so shocking but interesting ending.This is hardly a tour de force. It is not as thick as other Grisham thrillers, and because of that, The Summons lacks character and plot depth.However, it still has that Grisham stamp. Fans will be satisfied."
2,Grisham is slipping,"For fans of John Grisham' books the Firm and other early books, this is a MAJOR let down. The story drags on and on and it seems like it will never end. The only redeeming grace is the ending, but even that is weak by early Grisham standards.I hope Mr Grisham gets back to his early style, if not, I am not reading any more."
2,A big disappointment,"The book started out great,got better up to the middle,then got boring half way thru,and then got okbut had a great ending.I have read all his books and will continue reading his books.It was a fast read because there were a lot ofhalf pages and wide borders and only 341 pages. ...no one should be ashamed for giving an honest review asone reviewer said. He is the one who should be ashamed"
2,A Major Disappointment,"I had eagerly awaited this return to the legal thriller by John Grisham. What a disappointment!! The ending was hardly worth the mediocre build-up. Grisham writes amazing descriptions of people and places but in this book, it just goes nowhere! TRY AGAIN JOHN! I haven't given up on you yet!"
4,Plus/Minus,"Grisham's writing continues to improve, especially in the area of character development, however the resolution of this plot is not very satisfying."
1,The End ( thankfully ).,"Unimaginative and uninspired writing. While it is written the main character agonized upon finding $3 million, I am hoping, but doubting, Grisham suffered similar agony in accepting a fee for this plodding tale. Fleshing out and involving the secondary characters such as the King of Torts or Harry Rex could have made for an interesting plot and ending. Overall, a weak and tiresome effort, perhaps Grisham has hit the writer's wall. This 'coulda been a contenda'."
2,"Disappointed by this one, he's written better.","I found this book to be far from the typical Grisham lawyer-esque ""can't put down"" novel. The first half was slow, boring and repetitive. I thought it lacked the character development, vivid description and the interesting plot twists so many of his other books have (Time to Kill, Runaway Jury, The Brethren, etc.). The ending was anticlimactic, but I was so apathetic as opposed to entertained by the story at that point that it was just a relief to finish."
2,Very ordinary,"I have read all the Grishams to date, but this was in my mind the most mediocre yet. Yes, it has a legal-related theme, but this book is simply not a page-turner, only becoming interesting in the last 30 pages.Although I have been buying all the Grishams in hard back and reading them all, I'll have to reconsider this with the next one."
3,THE SUMMONS,"JUDGE ATLEY WAS A RESPECTED LAWYER IN CLANTON MISSISSIPPI. HE HAD 2 SONS, RAY AND FORREST. RAY WAS A LAW PROFESSOR IN VIRGINIA, AND FORREST WAS ADDICTED TO DRUGS AND COMMITTED CRIMES. BOTH WERE 'SUMMONED' TO MISSISSIPPI WHEN THEIR FATHER DIED. HE LEFT THEM WITH HIS ESTATE, AND A SUSPICIOUS 3 MILLION DOLLARS THAT RAY FINDS. OVERALL THIS BOOK WAS PRETTY ENTERTAINING, IT HAD A LOT OF TWISTS AND SURPRISES. MOST OF THIS BOOK IS PRETTY SIMPLE THOUGH, LEAVING LITTLE TO THE IMAGINATION."
3,An average attempt...,"I have read all of John Grisham's books, this one is fairly average compared to his other works. THE SUMMONS is about two brothers who receive a 'summons' to see their dying father to discuss the will and arrangements when he passes. When Ray arrives at the house, he finds his father has passed and he happens upon a large amount of cash hidden in the house. This happens within the first 20 to 30 pages and the rest of the book is spent telling a story about Ray trying to figure out where the money came from and Ray wrestling with his conscience to decide what to do with the money (should he include it in the estate, share it with others, or keep it for himself).THE SUMMONS is an easy read and the ending has quite a twist but the rest of the book is a bit flat."
3,Not Very Exciting,"It was easy reading because of so much dialog. I read the book quickly and enjoyed it but there were a few problems. I tired of reading how the money was moved around so many times, there wasn't enough action in the story, and I noticed a few mistakes in the grammer that got passed the editor.The ending was a surprise to me.But,I'm not ever able to figurer out the ending ahead of time of any book or movie. The book was O.K. but that is about it."
3,Audio book review,"My husband & I listened to this novel on audio. Michael Beck does a good job with the voice acting and is enjoyable to listen to during a long car trip. I can not rate this book as high as other Grisham works. While he is known for depicting the human flaws and weaknesses in his characters, I really wanted to ""like"" the main character, Ray Atlee. However, there wasn't too much I found admirable about him. The main thrust of this story is about greed and lack of trust. The plot is not terribly complicated and is boring in places. There is adequate suspense, but the ending is rather weak and predictable. My husband liked this book a little more than me and that may be a male vs. female opinion. There are only 3 minor female characters in this book and none are likeable. Actually, I think Grisham went out of his way to depict the females as unpleasant. There are many other Grisham works that are superior to this, so I wouldn't waste time on this one."
2,Did he just get tired of writing this book near the end?,"I've read most of Grisham's books and have enjoyed them all. This book, while entertaining and interesting for the first three-quarters suffers from malaise near the end. It's almost as if his publisher was pressuring him for the book and he just wrapped it up because he had to. I thought the end was not very well developed, was disappointing and lacked his usual polish and finesse. It was, all things considered, a disappointing read and although the beginning had me enthusiatically talking it up to friends, the end put the damper on any recommendations I would make for this book."
2,Take it at face value,"This book was good for what it was, I suppose. I was recvoering from surgery and needed an easy, fast read that did not require too much concentration on my part. I have read several Grisham novels and would have to agree with other reviewers in that this certainly was not the best work he has produced. The number one problem was that there was not one iota of suspense! There weren't any twists or turns or anything that made you say ""Hmmmm....?"" I kept waiting for something that would actually push this story along, but no such luck. Ninety percent of this book was ho hum, ho hum, and then the story gets resolved in the last twenty pages in an ""oh yeah, by the way, this is who did it"" fashion."
1,The Summons,"Unlike Grisham's previous works, The Summons was a grave disappointment. The characters lacked any endearing qualities; the pace of the book was tedious; the ending was obvious long before the reader reached the end, and the only factor driving the reader to complete the book was the misguided hope that Grisham would manage, at some point, to bring some of his usual sparkle to this work. Don't waste your money or time on this book; look for one of his earlier works if you value a fast pace, interesting characters and an intriguing plotline. Perhaps Mr. Grisham is too busy worrying about screenplays to worry about writing good prose."
2,"light, predictable, formulaic","yes my friends it is typical grisham-if thats what you want you've got it; warning; its no ""The firm"" the tale is trying to be complex but its not.on the positive side if you have a cold or are on the beach it is a light read."
2,Disappointing ending,"An intriguing beginning, however, plot-less, and very disappointing ending. Not recommended."
2,It had potential...,Plot starts out with potential but does not develop. Characters lack personality and the only anticipation is waiting for something to happen. Not one of Grisham's finer moments.
1,Don't Buy This Book! (Please!),"This book is a terrible attempt at irony, from a formula writer who has lost his recipe. This is the worst book I have read in years, and I would save you the money and time that is wasted by reading it. It's too late for me, but you can still save yourself!Grisham has written several fine novels with legal intrigue that have great characters, and a driving plots - this is not one of them. This book begins with a death and some unexplained cash with the body. The son finds it, and the entire book is about his attempt to find out where it came from, and how to keep it away from other people. Oh yeah- someone else knows about the money - oooooh. No great twists, suspense, or legal manipulation. Just boring trudging through simple words. It left me angry that I had wasted my time.If you're stuck on Grisham, go re-read the Pelican Brief, The Summons isn't worth your time."
5,Master Story Teller,Grisham is the most masterful story teller I have discovered in the past five years. I'm going down the list of his titles and looking forward to enjoying them all. So far The Summons is the best of the four Grisham books I've read.
1,Goodness Gracious!,"Dear John. John, John, John...where should I begin? I've been wondering why bookstores around Tupelo have been advertising extremely low prices for the hardback version of this book...now I know why. Could it be the obvious lack of editorial effort (has anyone else noticed the annoying typographical errors)? I thought your wife, et al, read your final copy before publishing? And between chapters, I promise you, no one has forgotten the characters of the novel, so it is not necessary to keep introducing them as if you knew we would put the book down for several days (in disgust) and finally pick it back up to read. I love you John - you're still good for Mississippi even though you left us - but please don't rush to write another novel for whatever reasons - you're too captivating for that kind of racket. Take as much time as you need on the next one, dear, we will all wait patiently. P.S., I loved The Testament and find it interesting that others did not...to each his own."
2,"I love all Grisham Novels, but think he's losing his touch.","Everytime John Grisham has a book out, I can't wait to read it; even if I have to get the hardback copy. So of course, when this came out, I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. I was totally into it (kept me reading until the wee hours) then to my disappointment, the ending totally failed me! I think that Mr. Grisham needs a vacation from writing a book every other month and to come up with a more feasible conclusion for his novels.I would wait until this comes out in paperback and also wait for his future novels to be made into movies."
2,"Unbelievable, readable, quite forgetable","I can't imagine why a laywer teaching at UVA would have to go three times to a casino to see if his ""found"" money was good. Go to any 7-11 or Quickstop and they'll tell you if your 100 bill is legitimate. Why drive around with 3 million in cash in a flashy car in rural Mississippi and not expect the car to be broken into? I was kind of hoping it would be stolen. It would have added something to the story....What's the big surprise? I think Mr. Grisham should go back to practicing law so he can catch up on real life, which is stranger than fiction.It goes to show you that the big name authors can write anything and still get $15 for a book."
1,A Major Disappointment,"Simple plot, simple characters, simple ending. If Grisham had written The Summons as his first book, he would be a full time Little League coach in Oxford, Mississippi. So much pre-release hype. It's a shame that publishers turn good authors into lazy has-beens just to pump out books-for-a-buck. I've purchased every Grisham book, but never again. The public library will be my only investment in Grisham's future."
1,Hey John - ever heard of writer's block? Look into it.,"While Grisham's books have always been something of a guilty pleasure for me, this one insults. What should have been a throwaway short story has somehow been stretched into the literary equivalent of 99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall. Grisham's unsympathetic protagonist Atlee has got to be the world's thickest law professor - ever heard of a safe deposit box, dude? The cardboard-cutout characters never rise from their comic book upbringings, and the story goes, well, nowhere worth going. The Accidental Tourist meets bad 1970s detective show. Not even worth waiting for the paperback. Trust me. Really. No, not even at the airport. Put it down I say!"
2,Worst in years,"Easily the worst Grisham I have ever read--weak story, few characters, no hint to who the antagonist is, gives no reasons for the protagonist's actions, no courtroom action, or legal action related to the plot. Save your money, or buy one of his older ones like ""The Runaway Jury,"" The Partner,"" or ""The Rainmaker."""
1,THE SUMMONS,"T wo brothers are summoned home by a dying father.H e&#65533;s a retired judge living in MississippiE xcitement abounds for one son when he discovers some cash.S oon the story deteriorates as the son hides the lootU nsure what to do, the story begins to tread waterM ostly we wander about without very much meaningM oney rules the action as it&#65533;s moved from place to place.O nly problem is, nothing else happensN ice to be able to produce this and still claim a bestseller.S hould be a short story!"
2,Hes Lost It!,"Whatever John Grisham once had he has showed us after two non-law book that he has completely lost it. This book drug on with absolutely no drive. Every Grisham book starts slow but you always know it will pick up and usually it does, I was at the middle of the book still waiting for the book to pick up and drive us to an interesting mysetery and wonderful suspense when i realized it was going nowhere. the middle of the book and i was still waiting! the ending was that amputated that's it kinda ending which leaves you feeling used as if it was written by the writers of a bad soap opera who can't figure out how to end a story line so they decide the character was knocked out and had dreamed the entire thing. I do not recommend this book to Grisham Fans, skip it if you want to remain a fan and possibly pick up a James Patterson book as for now Grisham has lost a fan with this poorly written book."
4,A TYPICAL John Grisham novel,"The first time I heard about his new novel, I said ""Ah, he went back to his old habit, a novel full of lawyers"". It is the most typical John Grisham. The story is quite interesting, and the plot is a bit complicated. The plot has different aspects to it, you would each one. It goes from techniques of tracking gangster to great schemes. And the ending is shocking. But don't be misled by my description, it is not full of action. Generally it is very good, it's been a while since I enjoyed a typical John Grisham novel."
4,One of Grisham's best...,"Despite what the other reviews said, I went and bought the book. And believe me, it is without doubt one of John Grisham's best books.Though the book may seem boring for a few, but I enjoyed it a lot. It is different from other Grisham books, but it entertain, and thats the main point.It doesn't have to do much with courtroom battles or something, but its a nice, sweet and short story of this Law Professor Ray Atlee, who stumbles upon his father's secret.Its not the usual Grisham books, but I will recommend the book to those who like the simple, short, touching kind of a plot."
1,Worst of Grisham,"I am greatly disappointed by this piece of work. I wish John, after his tremendous successful, would have the respect for his followers.This book has very thin plot. John just doodled around to fill pages. A waste of my time and his talent.Don't even deserve the single star, which happens to be the lowest I was allowed to select."
3,Not one of Grisham's best efforts.,"The Summons is fast-paced legal thriller with all the elements Grisham is known for: a well developed plot, interesting/colorful characters, and a need to ""find the truth"". While I really enjoyed this novel, it was clearly not one of Grisham's best efforts. The story tailed-off considerably in the final few chapters.Definitely a good story for a book club as it will generate much discussion, especially regarding alternative endings."
3,not so bad,"i'm surprised how many people didn't like this book. I found it a quick read, which for me was good as i have little time these days. i have read all grisham's books and have yet to be disappointed. Geez, people, lighten up. I would recommend it, for what that's worth."
3,Hardly exciting anymore....,"When I read my first John Grisham I was very excited about his style and his sense of plot. However, as his creative output continued I became increasingly aware of the fact that he is progressively become less and less interesting. His stories are becoming more similar and ""The Summons"" is an excellent example of that. It is still a fairly good read, but seriously, I think he should either stop writing while he's still on top of his game, or he should go on some kind of retreat. The storyline is entertaining, especially for those who have never picked up a John grisham before, but the concept is rather chewed up for those who know his style. The most I can give him is 3 stars and hope that either his next book will be an amazing revival of his earlier skill, or that he will never pick up the pen again."
2,A real disappointment -- Where is Grisham?,"I've always been a great Grisham fans and found this book extremely disappointing. There was basically no plot at all, and the whole book could've been condensed to 10 pages telling the same story.I had to struggle through the book and as I reached the end, I really wondered where the ending of the story was.Where has the real Grisham gone????"
4,TRICKY ENDING.,"Grisham got me on this one; I didn't have it figured out till the end. I don't think this is one of his best, but it was good enough to hold my attention."
1,A disappointment for Grisham fans,"This book had a lot of potential. If it had been a short story, it would have been a great read. But it just drags on...and on... and on...to a very disappointing and unsatisfying ending."
1,Very Disappointing,"I am a big Grisham fan, so looked forward to his new book. I did finish it, but mostly because I had nothing else to read. There are no appealing characters in this novel - not much suspense. I didn't really care who came out ahead.... Don't bother. His earlier books are much better."
2,Weak,"I have enjoyed every Grisham novel to date, but not this one. I could not get past the unnatural dialogue, fake-sounding names, and lack of character development. I found myself not caring if the main character lived or died. I have a hard time believing John Grisham actually wrote this book. If you have any kind of standards at all, don't waste your time with this one."
2,Not his best effort,"I was very disappointed by the very lame effort put forth by Mr. Grisham. The plot was very thin and repetitive. How many times can $3 million be loaded in a trunk and hauled around? How many times can a threatening letter come, especially when you can figure out in the first third of the book who is doing it? Normally I can't wait to keep reading his books. In this case, I couldn't wait until I got done reading so I could start a more interesting book."
5,from anniesrats.com,"I love John Grisham, always have!The SUMMONS, was no exception, itwas excitement and non stop thrillsup until the end.Ray Atlee, the main character isa typical, easy going law professor,with usual comforts that go withthe job and salary.ONCE Ray and his brother FORESTare summoned back home, the adventurebegins.Although, the ending wasn't particularly inmy best interest, it did leave it open for a wholenew adventure. And who doesn't wantanother, GRISHAM adventure??They are so breathtaking, tantalizing,get your heart pounding vivid in your face,adventures, that you have to keep on reading,until you finish."
2,Not what I was hoping for.....,"I was so excited for another legal thriller - but found that this had nothing to offer....no hooks, no suspense, nothing that I felt kept me reading. I could have easily put it down and not picked it up again. I recently finished ""A Painted House"" and felt more for Luke than I did for Ray Atlee. Sorry John, seems that since you have started with a new genre, you have forgotten what made your earlier works so great....suspense along with a cat and mouse game thrown in."
3,I was disappointed,"Having read all of John Grishams books I had becomed spoiled. In The Summons he did fairly well at developing some of the characters. Most of the detail was good. However, [here it comes]it was as if he had written so much and decided he had to wrap this story up.This he did in the last 15 pages of the book. All of a sudden the book was over and I went whaaaaat? That's it? Come on John, you can do better than that. Maybe it was too much to expect after such a run of really good books with strong characters, clever plot lines and dramatic endings. Oh well, there's always next February when his next thriller hits the street. Let's hope its better than this years."
1,Surprisingly Bad,"I've read (and enjoyed) 4 other books by Grisham, and thought this would be a good book to take on vacation. Halfway through I considered just putting it down, but I didn't have anything else to read. The ""plot twists"" are fairly obvious. The action is repetitive, moving the money again, going to another casino, etc etc etc... By the end I didn't really care what happened, but was just determined to finish. All in all a suprisingly weak effort from a talented writer."
2,Two One Dimensional,The book did not really hold my attention. What took a whole book to do could have been done in a quarter of the space! A short story would have been best for this book. It drags on in a one dimensional path. I forced myself to finish this book.What a shame. Grisham's other books were much better.
1,Not actually a novel,"I'd have to agree with a previous reviewer - this would have been a better short story. As is, it's pretty much a one act play, with a few scenes of filler thrown in to round it out.Halfway through the book I realized it wasn't going to be getting any better, but I toughed it out until the end. Not much excitement, and pretty one-dimensional plot. Do yourself a favor and just read ""The Firm"" again...."
2,"Not as Bad as The Testament, But . . .","The Summons is definitely a disappointment. Characterization and writing were fine, but I read Grisham for plot, and the plot of this one was way too thin. It might have made a decent short story, but of course there's no money in that.Save your money and re-read The Rainmaker or The Firm."
1,What a waste of time!,"Interesting start, but very weak storyline... don't waste your time reading this book."
1,I almost gave up reading after this book,"As a fan of Grisham, I picked this up when it was released and was excited about it. I had just gotten home from college and felt like reading a book to start this summer. This, though, was by far one of the worst books I have ever read in my entire life. There is not plot, the ending is not suprising at all, and the most suspense the book gives is wondering if it could possibly stay as bad as it is throughout.Instead of this book, pick up The Partner, which is truly a great book. After this, though, I will never read a Grisham book ever again, and will most likey stay away from pop fiction. Yes the book was really this bad."
2,A Disappointment to a long-time Grisham fan!,"I have been a Grisham fan since the publication of THE FIRM and this is the 7th book I've read by this usually entertaining author. However, I was very disappointed in THE SUMMONS. I felt inundated with extraneous information and unnecessary characters and I also thought that about of the book was dedicated to promoting Grisham's next novel, THE KING OF TORTS (which actually sounds more interesting than this one!).The only reason I didn't give this book 1 star is because the writing itself was good and I was motivated enough to finish it. I guess what kept me reading was my conviction that the plot twist would be less obvious than it actually was!"
1,"very poorly done, shallow characters and unclimatic ending","I drive a lot so I buy many audio books to enjoy during the long drives. This book is just one of a few really bad ones that I wish I had spent money on something more worthwhile. You have a feeling that the book was hastily put together to make money. Of the few characters in the book, you can easily guess what happened. And most of the characters are shallow and faceless. At the book's ending, you'll find yourself asking, 'is that it?'"
1,Grisham is getting lazy...,"I don't know about anyone else out there, but am I alone in thinking that there was absolutely no motivation for Ray, Grisham's main character in this pitiful book, to go to the lengths he did to hold on to ...million[s] [of] dollars? It's bad enough the book's plot was full of more holes than a piece of swiss cheese, but for cryin' out loud, give the main character some level of depth! Grisham has been steadily going downstream. I don't think I'm alone in urging him not to sign anymore of those one-book-a-year deals and write something of quality and honesty."
3,Not his best,"I didn't read his last two books because, quite frankly, I love Grisham legal thrillers, not just Grisham books. So, I'm sad to say that this one was a disappointment. Not horrible (one or two stars), but certainly not praiseworthy either. There wasn't any reason to root for Ray - he really didn't have much of a life - and I just couldn't imagine anything improving for him as a multimillionaire. His brother left alot to be desired, even in the end. The ending was one of those that makes you go ""HUH? That's it?!?"" I hope his next gets back to what makes him a best selling author."
3,disappointing,"I found this book to be disappointingly shallow, short, and without much substance. Finished it in a few hours. Neither characters nor plot had much substance. Grisham is riding on his reputation."
2,What a bore,Grisham has committed the ultimate author sin. He has written a totally BORING book. Although I liked the basic premise of sons -vs- father (judge) and even the money plot (although overused) might have been interesting. But Grisham just goes on and on about absolutely nothing. There was almost no plot to this story and his narrative had me yawning away. I will not recommend this book.
1,Huge Dissapointment,"This book was such a dissapointment compared to his others that I feel bad for him. I have always been a big Grisham fan, and this was his first book that I've been frustrated with. A major let down, don't spend the money."
2,The straight arrow Judge has 3 million in cash?,"The judge dies and his son finds the body ( or so it appears):he is the executor of the will. Then he find 27 boxes of cash,each with over $100000 in them... Someone else who isn't friendly starts following him around as he uses garbage bags to transport the money.He isn't going to declare it in the estate because with that much money the governments gets most of it. He spends most of the book tracking down where his Dad got all that money while his brother goes into rehab for thenth time. When someone burns up the airplane he has just bought with partners, the chase becomes serious. For me this law professor is pretty stupid ( he should open a Swiss account or an offshore back account or at least a set of safe deposit boxes) in letting the thugs bully him.The twist at the end is interesting but not too earth shaking...This book is really not John Grisham's best work."
2,Sad,"I have read all of Mr. Grisham's books and find this one to be among the most bland.Ray Atlee is sent a letter by his dying father to attend a meeting. Upon arrival, Ray finds his father dead in his study.It just so happens that Ray then stumbles upon over 3 million dollars in boxes hidden within the study.The absurd ways that this character tries to hide the money is ridiculous. All of the characters are hollow and the book leaves a lot of unanswered questions.I am a huge fan of John Grisham but it took me two separate checkouts at the library to get through this book."
2,The Summons,"If you are an avid Grisham reader, this book will be a great disappointament. The lack of action and plot line is frustrating to read. Without the normal excitment that fills other Grisham books, The Summons is difficult to read completely through. This was definitely not Grisham at his best."
3,not sooo bad,"i liked this book. i found it a nice quick and, dare i say it, entertaining read. i have read all grisham's books and have yet to be disappointed. it may have been a bit predictable, but it was definitely enjoyable. i have little time these days, so it was one of the few books i was able to finish quickly. i would recommend it to anyone. geez, people, lighten up."
3,"Grisham is great but this one is just ""average""","If you haven't read any Grisham books this one may be OK for you to start but after reading his book ""The Street Lawyer"" this one is a bit of a let down. Michael Beck does a good job of reading as usual but the plot lacks the punch of many of the other Grisham books. I have read about 6 of his works so far and I would have to say that ""The Summons"" ranks near the bottom of the list. Still better than many books but not as good as I have come to expect from Grisham."
2,Will the real John Grisham please come back!,"The Client, The Firm, A Time to Kill - these were the true John Grisham books. This one is mildly entertaining, but certainly not up to what you expect from him (the early him, that is). The other reviews describe the book-I'd just like to appeal to Mr. Grisham to please take more time or whatever it will take to go back to the books you used to write.JLatislaw"
2,Use Your Library Card on This One,"Grisham is a very talented, elegant writer but the story is depressing and mundane. Not a waste of time but I wouldn't invest in buying it."
1,Too long...too simple...what a waste of time!,"I've read several of Grisham's earlier novels, and I thought they were imaginative and easy to read. ""The Summons"" on the other hand, is about 100 pages too long i.e. very repetitive, lacks imagination, and the ending is almost predictable. One wonders whether the author just writes anything to get a book published and to make money for it. Evidently the editorial publishers don't care how poorly his books are written."
3,Disappointing...,"The Summons has to be the most disappointing story yet that I've read by John Grisham. I've read just about every work he's written and am a follower of his. However, the story about Ray Atlee was interesting and suspenseful but only to a point. It is as though Mr. Grisham was anxious to end his book and sort of rushed through the last several chapters just to finish it. When he did finish it, he just stopped. Period. Point blank. I don't know what else to say except that Mr. Grisham needs to work on his endings. A lot of his conclusions, not all, end the same way - very abrupt with nothing to savor. Mr. Grisham, you are a wonderful storyteller, but please give us some better and more lingering endings - like the one in the Painted House which causes you to think of it days after you finish the book...."
2,Disappointed Grisham fan,"This book starts out as a classic Grisham novel, but the ending was too predictable and un-Grisham like. Do not expect any of the typical Grisham mind twisting surprises in this book."
4,"hits the mark, but more mysteries than courtrooms","After a foray into traditional fiction, Grisham returns to the legal genre. Despite the cover, this really isn't a courtroom suspense novel, and bears marks of the movement towards the touch of morality plays started with The Testament. While it's more of a mystery with a twist, it's a mystery with a distanctly Grisham touch, and elements of self-plaigerism are less evident here than in his early string of courtroom novels. The ending is enough of a surprise to be pleasing, and abrupt enough to elicit a wry smile. A pleasant, breezy read"
3,Take A Break,"Perhaps I'll wait awhile before reading another Grisham novel - long enough to hopefully coincide with the time the author should take to decide where his passion really lies, what he longs to write about and how he can put his heart on paper again. Having just read THE SUMMONS I must say shame on authors who pump out books because they've established a name for themselves and don't care if they put any passion into the writing. And to the publisher, who does your proof reading? Being an Editor the errors in your text were distracting. Errors on top of mediocre writing causes one to think twice before buying again. Mr. Grisham, please don't let this book be a symbol of what you're worthy of creating because if it is, I found reading it wasted my time. You're better than this book signifies because I've read your repertoire and that's why I came back for more but not again. As my sister says, 'it seems like he's burned out'. Say it isn't so..."
2,A Big Dud,"I love reading Grisham and was anticipating a wonderful read. The book starts out exciting and before long Grisham has put in the hook. I was really enjoying the book! It was like watching someone getting ready to shoot a cannon and when the cannon ball is finally shot it lands under the nose of the barrel with a thud. When I finished the book I just sat there,somehow feeling cheated. My favorite Grisham books are The Rainmaker,The Client and The Painted House -- in fact, all of them but this one."
2,BORING,"Boring! And not what I had hoped for. I was thrilled when I thought Grisham was back to his legal thrillers. I guess I was wanting another A TIME TO KILL. I had to force myself to finish THE SUMMONS. I thought it was filled with a lot of useless fillers and no ""meat."" I hope that the next ""legal thriller"" by Grisham actually has some action and suspense. Because if that is what you are looking for, do not waste your time on this!Definately NOT worth the hardback price. If you feel like you must read THE SUMMONS...wait for the paperback."
1,Grisham forgot the law,"In his best works, including The Firm, he made good use of the law so the stories were plausable and held together. Here, everything seemed based around losing 50% of the estate to estate taxes.There was a $650,000 federal estate tax exemption, and, I don't know Mississippi law, but there is no way it would have approached the 50% mark.So the whole premise didn't make senseThe hype let me down. I thought Grisham was back; he isn't. Too bad."
4,A Fun read.,"The Summons is a neat and tidy, lawyer novel. It is clever and an enjoyable page turner. Grisham knows how to keep your attention and give you interesting views of the south and it's lawyers."
2,READING EXCELLENT - BUT STORY DOES NOT ADD UP,I listened to the audiotape unabridged version of this book. The reading was excellent but the story does not add up. It is a well-told story till the end (I will no spoil). But when a central question is answered and you think back on the story things just don't add up. You realize characters just have not acted in any kind of reasonable fashion. My guess is there will be some plot changes when the movie is made.
3,250 pages needed more work,"The only reason I kept on reading was to find out who else knew about the money. Like other reviewers have said, the book really dragged. Really Ray was literally dragging the money from storage place to hiding place to storage place. I get the impression that Grisham is turning out his books just to maintain his position on the best seller lists with another book, by virtue of his name."
1,What a disappointment!,...I am an avid reader and I have enjoyed all of Grisham's books since he appeared on the scene with his first legal thriller. I looked forward to reading The Summons and finally got the opportunity. My thoughts after putting it down was that if he had throw in some trashy sex it would belong the genre of books published by third rate paperback writers and/or publishers and did not belong with the list of past Grisham stories. I hope he does better in the future!
2,So little detail...Admittedly a little Boring,"I took in this book in about 6 hours of total reading and as a Grisham fan I anticipated this book being a legal thriller that was full of suspense and had a thick juicy plot. Unfortunately, I was really let down when all I found was a very basic plot without the real ""thriller"" part and a disappointing ending (to say the least). There were very few characters and it lacked the ""warmth"" build up to Ray Atlee the main character. In other words I never felt very close to him at all which is really too bad since this is usually what makes a book."
3,Why does he stink at the endings?,"It wasn't his best, but it was still pretty good. He has the knack for making you feel like you know the characters right from the first page. This one isn't the typical courtroom deal, or even the litigation nightmare but it does keep the pages turning.I still can't figure out why he stinks at the endings, though. Can you?"
2,Is Grisham just cranking them out for the $$?,"This book starts with some great character development, building suspense and giving you the impression that you are in for a wild ride. Then it just stalls out for no apparent reason. The end was lame. It seemed like Grisham had a good idea, then lost inspiration."
2,Met My Expectations,"I remember almost flunking an important exam in college because I couldn't stop reading The Pelican Brief to study. WIth two small children, I bought this book to read on vacation because I knew it would be an easy read at the end of long days at the amusement park. I wasn't disappointed.Grisham's legal suspense novels have become too predictable. I enjoyed The Painted House (unlike many of my Grisham-addict friends)and hoped Grisham would continue to pursue more serious writing. Skipping Christmas helped me put the right perspective on the holiday season while providing an abundance of chuckles.Meanwhile, I continue to hold out hope that Grisham will thrill us all again one day. Until then, I'll save his books for my lighter reading needs."
4,Page-turner with surprise ending,"The Summons is a page-turner; very suspenseful. It really held my interest. It was fun trying to figure out who else might know about the money that Ray found, and who it was that was trying to get it from Ray. I related to Ray's delimma when he found the money and to the actions he took while trying to figure out what to do with it. The ending was quite a surprise to me - never would have suspected it. Great book!"
3,Not what I expected,I have been a fan of Grisham in the past however this book was a big disappointment . I found it difficult to keep reading. I just wanted to skip all the page filling crap and get on with the story. The characters had no real depth even though there was a lot of babble about them. The ending was disappointing as well. Not Grisham's best work.
4,I ENJOYED IT,"NO REVIEW, YOU ARE ASKING TOO MUCH. WHY DON'T YOU OFFER ME A FREE BOOKFOR ALL OF THIS WORK."
1,This is why I stopped reading Grisham,"This book was a waste of my time. The plot was so weak and thin, it was like a high school assignment gone wrong. The characters were caricatures, and not in a good way. The ""hero"" if you can call him that, is weak, stupid, and acts as though he has no idea how the real world operates. He constantly puts himself in dangerous positions for absolutely no reason, and blabs all kinds of information that it's obvious he should keep to himself. He also can't figure out how it is he is so easily followed, when a three year old would know by the third time it happens. The brother was a one dimensional character portrayed as not too bright because of his many addictions through the majority of the book but he suddenly becomes a mastermind at the end. It felt like this book was written in a rush, with little attention to detail, and once the number of pages required was met, it abruplty ended. Never will I waste my time with Grisham again, his days are over."
3,Grisham ! what happened?,"After reading initial grisham worls like Firm,Chamber and Time to Kill I had big hope abot this book too..Alas how dissapointed I was. This story is shallow with lot of loose ends..when Ray atlee escapes from the home what happens to his money? Does Forrest comes and get it or his sidekicks does it? The bad guys does everything except searching Ray's car which is the most obvious place to hide money for Ray,,come on Grisham u can do better than this"
3,"Uniquely Grisham, but definitely not his best","Somehow John Grisham has lost much of his appeal. Again, he comes out with a novel that does't reach the quality of previous releases.Nevertheless, ""The Summons"" is a typical Grisham. The story is not bad, but barely believable and very predictable...though the end is somewhat surprising.Obviously Grisham ran out of good flicks for his books. Everything in ""The Summons"" has appeared in one of his older novels.I hope that Grisham one day will find to his old quality again and write better stuff than ""The Summons"", which is okay for reading in your vacation."
2,Grisham sticking to his formula,"Again, John Grisham has written a book using the exact same formula as the one he used in ""The Firm,"" ""The Pelican Brief,"" and ""The Client."" The books are all about people on the run from other people who are trying to hurt them. If you like the formula, you'll like the book. If you agree with me that Grisham should develop a new formula because this one's getting old, then skip this book."
3,Better but not his best,"It was great to see John Grisham get back to what he does best. And, while I am glad I purchased and read this book I am also glad that I saved money at Amazon. I would have been even more disappointed if I had paid full price for this work. The story is fairly interesting but the end, while an interesting twist, is less than satisfying. Buy this one at a discount."
1,Spelling and grammar errors ruined the book,Spelling and grammar erros made the book too painful to enjoy.I feel cheated because I paid hard earned money for a book that the publisher did not bother to have proofed by a human before publishing.
3,Has Grisham run out of ideas?,"I have read all of Grisham's ""legal"" novels. They seem to be following a progressive trend downhill. While this is not a ""bad"" book, it is not what one would expect from an accomplished novelist. The plot is very simple and mostly predictable. The moral dilemma of what to do with $3,000,000 is marred by the childish antics of the main character. Grisham's continual trashing of the legal profession is also getting old. I'm a doctor and have no love lost for most attorneys, but his characterizations of lazy academics and money grubbing crooks are somewhat overdone (I hope)."
2,What a disappointment,"I was eagerly awaiting Grisham's return to the world of the law and had read a few promising early reviews of the book. What I read was a predictable whodunit that was obvious from early on. As another reviewer observed, the ending is a lead-in to a future sequel. I have never known Grisham to be this lazy in the past (other than a reliance on a formula of small time young Southern lawyer in over his head with the big boys, which we forgave because his writing was strong and his characters memorable). His writing is still strong in moving a story along, however, the characters are stock types and not that interesting. A weak effort."
3,Still Enjoyed It.,"While entertaining, and definitely in Grisham style,this storyline had so much more potential. I've been spoiled by this author's earlier books, so I expected more from The Summons. But I still enjoyed the read and the ride. Still had some small twists and excitement. I liked the small town feel and the character development. I look forward to reading more."
4,something different,"John Grisham's latest stars attorneys, but it is not about a trial. This book is about human nature and relationships. Grisham shows us that greed affects everyone (even members of the bar). Michael Beck gives a terrific performance especially in the scene in which there is dialogue between a character with a British accent and one with a southern accent."
2,The Summons,"Very disappointing, shallow story, too short. Mr Grissom has apparently forgotten what got him to be a best selling author. He has lost me as a customer."
1,Terrible,"Grisham has lost it. Too bad, he had some great legal spell binders. At any price this book is a rip."
2,The Summons,John Grisham has written some great books. This isn't one of them. I am sure if I had a day to write a book I could come up with a product to rival this one.I keep saying it but this time I mean it. This is the last Grisham book I will buy.
1,A Summons for Bad Judgement,"I was in the mood for a light, easy read and had not read Grisham in a while...boy was I disappointed. Light and easy it was and all those pages to build up to such a disappointing ending. When I think back to how well written, A Time to Kill was, Grisham should have just stopped there and gone back to practicing law or something else. It truly was a waste of my time and I didn't have that much time to kill in what it took to read ths book."
1,Just so disappointed,"From the start to the end, I was expecting somehow it would become better.But against my expectation, it never did...It was so frustrating to spend hours reading a book just to find out it was not worth your time, not to speak about the price of it."
2,Disappointed,A real let-down for any Grisham fan. He must have had something distract him after he wrote the first chapter and never regained his train of thought.
2,Probably the worst Grisham I've read,"When I began this book, I was hoping for the legal suspense which made Grisham famous. However, this book did not have much suspense. The entire book was a set up for the last pages--no real suspense or mystery in the middle. The ending was a little surprising, but not really. There had to be a catch (or I hoped anyway). But, there were only 2 credible ways that the book could have gone. With the vague ending, it seems that a sequel may be in the works, but I hope not."
2,"Well Written, But Dull","What a huge disappointment ""The Summons"" was. It was a boring plot which kept me reading because I figured it had to get better. This is, after all, John Grisham. After very entertaining books like ""Pelican Brief"" and several others, ""The Summons"" was only mildly entertaining. I would urge the curious reader to borrow this book rather than shell out more money for such a lackluster effort."
2,He should have to read it.......,"J.G. should have to read this book and rate it. I cannot believe he would be able to give it any more than 2 stars. Very predictable, easy to read, seems to me he wrote this novel over a long period of time because the flow is poor and in a word SIMPLE. Don't mistake it for clean prose, could have been a college writing assignment. Maybe it was old school work he found in boxes that gave him the idea for the hidden $."
2,The worst Grisham yet,"This has to be the worst writing by Grisham to date. The first 250 pages could have been omitted. The ending was bad, the characters were bad, the plot was bad...I could go on and on. I am an avid fan of JG, but not so much after this tale. Give me more of Brad Meltzer!MJM"
4,Grisham is back,"Finally Grisham is back with a legal thriller. His last novels (Skipping Christmas & A Painted House) were disappointing. An interesting plot, once again set in the south. I liked reading it.A book all Grisham fans will enjoy."
3,Disappointed,"I am a HUGE fan of John Grisham. I've enjoyed every book that he has written and read them all several times. I always look forward to his new novels and buy them the first day they are available. This one, however, was a disappointment. His novels are usually page-turners, but this one had none of excitement, twists or wit that his previous novels have been filled with. It's still a good book, but it wanes in comparison to his others."
1,the summons,"He is still cashing in on early well written books.He probably doesn't even write them anymore.His books lately including this one is thin in story mostly. Boring,never really goes anywhere.Lots of pages and words explaining virtually nothing."
1,Disappointment,"I couldn't believe how this book ended. I like ""A Painted House"" and hoped to have a similar reponse to this book...a slow beginning, middle I became interested and intrigued...but when I got to the last chapter I couldn't believe it...I felt cheated...what a cheap way to end the story---or was it to set up a sequel? I won't buy it. Terribly disappointed..."
2,Stinky Summons,"What a predictable book!The ""Ghost Writer"" for this novel needs to be fired!Don't waste your money!"
3,Good summer lightweight reading,"I found this book to be an enjoyable, summer lightweight read. It doesn't have a ""save the world"" plot with James Bond-sized villains, but it was fun to read. I don't know what people expect from Grisham; people seem to think that an author's name is the same as a brand name, and you will always get exactly the same experience. Still, save your money and buy the paperback. Great reading for up at the cabin, etc., where its slow pace will be appreciated."
2,when summoned - don't show up for this one,Terrible ~ boring ~ don't bother. Grisham has written a story that is lacking and one that is very predictable. I'm very disappointed.
2,Bites...,Grisham really rips his fans off with this one. Don't waste time or money. I will never buy another book before reading info here.
2,A dissapointment at best,"I have read all of Grishman's books. This is my estimation is the worst. I too kept reading, thinking that I would find a story or character to catch my interest. I am not one to put a book down once I started. I should , perhaps think again.I have always enjoyed the work of Grisham. I may take a chance on his next book but never as a ""Christmas read""."
2,My least favorite Grisham novel,"I have to wonder if John Grisham has still got it. After being disappointed by The Testament, I gave him another shot with The Summons. Unfortunately, I was once again disappointed.This is a frustrating novel. I enjoyed the characters--they felt like real people with real problems. I thought the story idea was interesting, although not well executed. The pace was slow and I had to force myself to pick up the book on several occasions. However, once Grisham begins the novel's climax, it was difficult to put down.Overall, the characters and the main story saved this novel from a one-star rating from me."
2,Worst Grisham by far,"I've ready them all, as I'm sure you have, and this is by FAR the worst. I kept waiting for something to happen - this was like ""A Painted House"" with a few lawyers thrown in. Uninteresting characters, no excitment, no driving plot. And it looks like it will continue with ""The King of Torts,"" since a character in this story has a boat by that name. Yawn...."
1,Grisham's worst!,"Shame on John Grisham for wasting my time. It was a good story, until the end, which leaves you hanging with regard to who is responsible for much of what happened in the book and for what will happen next. It's almost as if there is to be a sequel. If there is, I, for one, won't be interested in reading it. I'm too angry at Mr. Grisham for having wasted a big part of my weekend reading this lousy book."
1,How can Grisham be so boring?,"This book is slower than a lazy southern river on a hot summer day. I would have expected something a little more interesting from Grisham. The main characters, especially the protagonist are morally bereft and unlikeable, and the story just drags along, daring the reader to finish this slow-as-molasses novel. By the middle of the book, I no longer cared where the money came from, and I don't recommend this to anyone, unless you have insomnia."
1,Wet Noodle,"I have read all of Grisham's books while I fequently fly....the last few have left me flat at the end like a wet noodle. This one enough so that I decided to warn others about it. Grisham's early works were a great read, enjoyable to the end and satisfying afterwards....Summons starts that way and makes the noble attempt but then seems like he got tired of writing and had to wrap up the book to get it to the publisher to meet a time commitment....Very unsatisfying and not worth the time to read. I'm still a grisham fan but will be very hesitant to simply pick up his next book based."
2,One of the Year's...,"Transparent characters, one-line sarcastic dialogue (in place of conversation), and a thin plot makes you wonder if Grisham wrote this on his lunch hour. Certainly not one of his more intriguing works (anyone who couldn't figure out the villian in the first 30 pages?). Without a doubt, one of the year's WORST!"
2,Long and Repetitive,"Hi ,I like Grisham ,but this last novel,to long and to repetitive. You cuold forsee the end,no courtroom action,not enough suspense. It starts well but the carring of the money to so diferent places very ""Boring"". I hope the next Novel take us back where we enjoy reading it."
1,awful....absolutely awful,"this book would be bad if any author wrote it, not just because it's Grisham and I had high expectations. there was no suspense and the plot was boring and stupid, there were far too mnay details about airplanes and the dead Judge and not enough story, the ending was so obvious...how can you have a who done it when there are only three characters, of cousre one of them had to do it!!!!....i agree with reviewers who thinks he has to send in so many books by a certian date.Grisham needs to slow down and write when he wants to....that was awful, but of course I will continue to read his stuff because I know what he is capabale of...good luck next time John...."
1,not what i'd hoped for,"wait for the paperback, if you buy this one at all. story somewhat reminescent of ""a simple plan"", but no where near as interesting or dramatic. this one is not up to par: thin characters, weak plot, minimal suspense. obvious ending.i've enjoyed mr. grisham's books very much and hope he is in a brief slump and not out of gas."
2,I expected more.,"I can't say I didn't enjoy reading this book at all. I did. BUT, at times I grew tired of money moving around in the same manner, house to trunk, trunk to apartment, apartment to storage unit, storage unit to storage unit and again, then unit to trunk, trunk back into house. Not very imaginative really. The main character flies around a lot, gambles some, is entertained by a rich guy, nothing even sinister there to get excited about. A girl is introduced for no purpose at all really. I stayed with it though, expecting a clever move finally and he'd be on easy street. Not so. The ending was a disappointment and completely unsatisfying."
2,Kinda Dull,"The book started off interesting, but by the end I got tired of reading about Ray hauling the money all over the South. Put it in a bank already, yeesh! Also, I guessed the person threatening him all along, but thought that it was too obvious... that John Grisham was a better writer than that. I guess no one is perfect all the time because all in all, this is not a great read. If you want to get it at the library for free, do... but I would not pay for it."
2,beyond a reasonable doubt,"I should have checked the Amazon ratings before picking up this novel.I was looking for a pleasant summer thriller - the kind that Grisham usually delivers. But this one disappoints. The primary weakness is plot. Why does the smart protagonist forget the obvious solution of registering the troublesome money with probate? What possible motive does a money-grubbing lawyer have to give away $3M when the gift can only cause him trouble? And how did the drug-befuddled brother manage the complicated theft without losing the money to his criminal cohorts? The story simply makes no sense.As Grisham often does, he weaves a moral question through this story. Here the idea is that the obvious black sheep of the family just may be morally superior to his alter ego. Unfortunately, the characters are just too shallow (and too deeply mired in an impossible plot line) to leave room for a reasonable doubt about conventional moral judgements."
2,Big Snore!,"Well I had promised myself I was not going to read any more of John Grisham novels... but I got suckered in to reading this one by a friend who highly recommended it (they are now off my highly recommend list...). The back cover had great promise but I discovered what we had was not John Grisham's latest novel but his latest novel length film treatment. YAWN! This will make a fun movie as a book it was boring and slow moving. You didn't come to care at all for any of the characters. In Grisham's other books you cared... CHEERED ON... Darby Shaw, Mitch McDeere, and Jake Brigance in this book there was no hero character for you to care about. It's a shame but they will fix it (maybe) when they make the movie."
3,"Solid, but, not his best work.","The Summons is a fast paced ""legal thriller"" in the same genre as JG's other books, but not nearly as thrilling. If you stack this book up against ""The Firm,"" or ""The Pelican Brief,"" You will be mildly dissapointed. With all that said this book is still solid and kept me entertained on a long flight from Amsterdam to Boston. This book is not going to set the world on fire, but it will keep you awake an interested in the story of Ray and Forest Atlee and the three million in cash that is up for grabs upon the death of their father. Worth reading.-Joseph Dworak"
2,Slipping?,"I think Grisham is heading the way so many authors who put out a book every year do, into thin strained plots. The original premise was good, but the plot began thinning out quickly, eventually drifting away. The ending lacked tension and was a true disappointment. It was difficult for me to believe the man who wrote the Runaway Jury also wrote this book."
4,Good book!,"This book is very ""Grisham"" - law in the south, family problems, it has it all. I truly enjoyed it and would recommend it to others."
4,Grisham Grows Up,"John Grisham has apparently grown up with this latest offering of legal intrigue. Idealism and ethics (or the occasional lack thereof?) are laced throughout this volume, but Grisham Justice has certainly evolved. I liked the cleanly concise book, with the big surprise at the end. The characters (or should I say caricatures?) were interesting if not totally lovable, and kept this reader guessing as to exactly who were the good guys/bad guys. The book was streamlined and uncluttered and perhaps there WAS an emptiness in Ray. The airplane lore and casino environment were fascinating as well as the insight into mass torts.Summoned home to a dying father (the Judge), law school professor Ray realizes he wasn't quite fast enough. And then he discovers a totally unexpected $3 million in cash - and a brand new will. The premise is certainly thought provoking."
4,Research Failure by Grisham,"A good book spoiled by a failure of the author to research a key component of his plot. He has the judge, his lawyer, and both sons upset that the IRS will take 50% of an estate that is well under the $675,000 level where the Estate Tax started back in in 2000 and 2001 (it went to $1 Million in 2002.) Although there is no specific date mentioned for the book, it has to be set in something near the present since the author refers to Reagan Airport in Washington, DC and the casinos in Tunica MS.I would have expected better from Grisham and his editors."
2,Slipping further,"Grisham's books are getting worse, not better. This book wasn't awful but it also wasn't that interesting, either. I remember how he used to weave an intricate plot [i.e. The Firm] and include interesting characters [i.e. The Chamber or The Client]. Neither of these can be found in this book. Characters are unidimensional. The plot is weak. I think in the future, I will wait for paperback versions of his books. Better yet, I will just borrow them from a friend and save my money!"
2,The Summons,"This book starts out with the promise of a ""Time to Kill"" type thriller, but falls short of the mark. The characters are dull and depressing. The action, if you could call it that is tamer than the disney movie, Snow White. The whole plot is disappointing to say the least, slightly better than having a root canal without novacaine.Only a die-hard Grishham fans would make their way through this book, unforunately by the time they finish, they may look for a new author to read.Holden Drum"
3,Not One of Grisham's Best,"I don't feel it's up to the caliber of his other novels as it just didn't have many twists and turn. But OK, if you like John Grisham."
4,Grisham's formula still works,"Grisham fans are already familiar with his standard storyline. Lawyer, usually Southern, usually broke, strikes it rich and risks everything he holds dear. This diverts just enough to make it interesting. Still a lawyer, still in theSouth, still strikes it rich, but there are enough twists and turns to keep it all flowing and very interesting. Grisham also manages to throw in the occasional red herring to keep the reader in suspense. It seems to me he left the ending wide open for a follow up book, and frankly, I'm looking forward to it!"
2,The Summons is no summons to read this book,"I Love John Grisham books, I would love to know who wrote The Summons, it doesn't read like any Grisham book I've ever read.I felt extremely disapointed in this book. The story rolled around like a roller coaster and in the end it didn't make enough cents to buy coffee.It's really a shame."
3,Formulaic thriller,"Read John Grisham's THE SUMMONS, his latest legalthriller . . . the problem: it wasn't much of a thriller . . . it is the story of two brothers who are summoned to their father's house to discuss the details of his estate . . . however, the meeting never takes place because the father dies too soon . . . there are some twists and turns, including the ending (perhaps the best thing in the book), yet methinks that I am getting tired of the formulaic approach that Grisham used here in putting this together . . . it is almost a paint-by-the numbers endeavor; i.e., it feels as if the author just went through the motions in putting this together . . . I'll give it faint praise by saying that it was at least better than hisprevious ""book,"" SKIPPING CHRISTMAS . . . what a jokethat was! . . . it was little more than a short story, somehowblown up to be sold as hardcover . . . whatever you do, missthat one!"
3,worth the read,"Not exactly his best work, but a very good ending to it makes up for the first half of the book.."
2,Grisham mailed it in,"Grisham must be under contractual obligation to finish X number of books, because he mailed this one in. Lazy plot. With the help of a good editor, I could have done better. Anyone who gives this book five stars either: 1) has a financial interest in seeing this book sell, or 2) gives every book they finish five stars."
3,"By far, not his best ---","I have read all of Grisham's books, and I was sorely disappointed in this one. Not his best by any means. It lacked his usual depth and mystery. It did not hold my attention like his past works and failed to hold up to its billing. John -- try again."
1,Barf!,"There must be a method for getting a refund (or at least a credit) on a book that is pretentious, immature, strung out, boring, repetitious -- in other words, a total waste of time and money. Grisham fill pages with flighty bits of superficial nonsense about gambling, flying, rehab houses, drug reactions, the UVa which do little to advance this essentially plotless story. I read it to the end because I had my 25 bucks invested, but I could baely wait til it ended. A 50 page short story might have been more appropriate. This is now 3 or more consecutive strikes on Grisham. He should quit and stop sucking hard-earned cash from hopeful readers. Give me back my money."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING !,"Very well written book, but basically nothing really happens until the last pages of the book. Very slow-paced. The end is ridiculous and very disappointing. Total lack of imagination."
2,A little slow.......,"I picked up this book for a cross country flight expecting another masterpiece, alas I did not find that. I thought that the story itself had some potential, but I thought it was very slow to develop. Ray is a great character who has some moral issues to deal with when it comes to the Judge's money, and the issues surrounding his brother Forest. I just thought that the plot poked along slower than his other offerings."
3,"thin plot, ok pace....not the best, but good","A far cry from the legal dramas that one can expect from Grirsham. A fairly thin plots with a flood of turning points in the end. Good narrative style as in other books of his, but the plot is not sufficient enough to keep a quick pace. Nevertheless, it is a story with few characters well told and leaves a feeling of existence of divine justice after one has read the book...One certainly expects a much better plot from Grisham and this book alone should not be held against him. There seems to be a slight change in his plot development methods from ""painted house"". Maybe the next book will tell. One can hope that it is better than ""the summons"". Overall, a good read, nothing to be really excited about....one for the lazier weekends.."
1,bookworm,"Another Grisham disappointment: predictable, slow, anticlimactic. It appears that Grisham is simply fulfilling his book contract as he laughs all the way to the bank."
2,Not at his best!,"I couldn't wait to finally read another ""law"" book by Grisham. Well after reading this one, I guess the next wait won't seem as long! The character development is poor, you don't feel anything for the characters. The book is very drawn out, lacking any real excitement. I was also expecting a better ending, it was no surprize to me at all!Hopefully his next book isn't so quickly put together as this one seems."
3,Disappointing,"Not your typical John Grisham work. The book was very easy to read, but unlike other Grisham books, this one was not hard to put down. The pace of the book was very slow and the action minimal. The final few chapters were good and the ending was surprising, but to get to the end seemed almost tedious. Compared to other authors that I have read, this is not a horrible book, but it definitely was not up to the usual John Grisham standards."
2,Not your typical Grisham,"This story moved so slowly. I kept reading just because I thought it had to get good at SOME point. The last 20 pages were interesting, maybe I should have started there and skipped the other 80% of the book."
3,"Good weekend book, but not great nor memorable Grisham","While this book had its share of good twists and plots, it really lacked action but had the reader thinking all the way to the end how Judge Atlee able to keep $3 Million in cash in his house. While the ending was not really and ending so to speak, at least it was a surprise in the end who was responsible for everything that tormented Ray Atlee and the cash. I'd say this is a good book to read and finish over the weekend."
2,Disappointed,"John Grisham is an exceptional writer, but his heart clearly wasn't in this book. The suspense Grisham so masterfully created in his previous novels is clearly absent in The Summons. Grisham's vivid character descriptions were also absent in this story. I never developed a clear picture of Ray Atlee.In addition, while Judge Atlee's loyalty to Southern culture and nineteenth century Mississippi was well-established, his charity and sympathy for poor native blacks didn't seem to fit his character. Perhaps Grisham was attempting to portray the Judge as a schizophrenic old man who was tired of living. How else could one explain the Judge's civil right mindedness and also his affection for Nathan Bedford Forrest, founder of the KKK?As an aspiring novelist, I still hold John Grisham in high regard. Nonetheless, I believe he missed the mark on this one..."
4,"""The Summons""","Grisham changes his writing to a leaner style which fits the fairly simple plot. The protagonist is flawed, the supporting characters are colorfully delineated, and the ending succeeds by both resolving the story at hand, but leaving the reader pondering the fates of the characters. Not his biggest or best, but still better than just about any popular fiction."
1,don't waste your money Grisham doesn't deserve it,"I made the mistake of reading Amazon's review, and gave Grisham one more chance, after two straight disappointments. It was so shallow Ithought he forgot to finish this book, as he had in his last supposed thriller. If you want to read a book similar to The Firm, read Brad Meltzer's The Millionaires. I think Grisham stole his sub plot from Meltzer, but didn't know how to finish it. Meltzer's keeps you guessing all the way through. I am finished with Grisham."
2,Getting worse,"My expectation may be higher than it should be. I read all his books, but I have to say that his work is getting worse. Although the basic concept of this book is interesting, he couldn't develop it well enough to entertain us. It's way too long to climax...actually, where is the climax? The ending is also very disappointed."
2,Summons,Who wrote this? This is the weakest Grisham book I have read and I generally like everything he has written. I kept waiting for it to grab me and it never did. And the end where he attempted to tie it all together was .... I was very disappointed. I got the feeling he had a deadline or book quota to meet so he just cranked it out knowing it would sell anyway. To make matters worse I was very disappointed that the publisher would allow a book to go out with so many spelling errors and mixed up words in sentences. In this day of computers and spell check there is no excuse for that.
1,"Don't summon ""The Summons.""","As a Grisham fan, I have read all of his books. Unfortunatley,he seems to be running out of credible material, which is also indicative of his last several books. Although the story starts out well, he uses too many digressions during the story which almost made me put the book down. There is no real tension or drama unfolding. The ending is quite predictable. The book is a real letdown. I hope he starts producing the good drama of his earlier books. He has been on a slow slide downward. I would suggest that you not summon ""The Summons."""
1,Don't waste your Money,"Second-rate to say the least! We have been ardent supporters who have purchased millions of books authored by Mr. Grisham. To this end, I would expect Mr. Grisham to give us an interesting read. This book was weak...the ending was boring...the characters were poorly developed and overall it was a waste of time to flip the pages. I would like my money back."
2,Never-ending Story,"I am a Grisham fan in the highest sense of the word ""fan."" Nonetheless, I was terribly disappointed with his latest offering. The Summons started out as any Grisham legal drama would, with a catchy story line to grab and hold onto the reader. However, the story never developed. I waited and waited for a ""twist"" that never came. Who knows...maybe Mr. Grisham's publisher was pressuring him to complete this book.My advice: Take your time on the next one, Mr. Grisham. The Summons was a disappointment, but we (your fans) know your work and look forward to your next offering. (We will forgive you this time.)"
3,"A Good Read, But Predictable","I have been a John Grisham fan for many years and have read every book he has written, so was not surprised to see that the story revolves around the legal system. The story is essentially a whodunit, and unfortunately, I was able to solve most of the mystery around three-quarters of the way through the book. Despite this, however, I was still surprised at the final ending, and was pleased with it. As much as I like Grisham's books, I feel that many of them have unsatisfying endings. He seems to be getting better at ending his books, as is the case with The Summons.This is a good book to read if you enjoy Grisham's style of writing, and if you're looking for a quick-read mystery."
2,Not great - Grisham fans look elsewhere,"(No spoilers) This one had a lot of potential, but ended up going nowhere. In fact, a little worse - the ending was abrupt and didn't really resolve anything.I tend to agree with the consensus here, though I will add that if they make a movie out of The Summons, I would hope they clean up some of the plot holes. There were a lot of little things that could have made a great story - the possible involvement of the mob, the unexplored history of their father's life as a judge, etc.None of these were explored in the book, and actually I didn't really care about the protagonist one way or another.If you're a huge Grisham fan and need to read the entire canon, then just realize this will be a slight disappointment. It wasn't absolutely awful, just flat & disappointing. But if you're new to Grisham, and looking for a good legal thriller, then maybe start elsewhere."
1,Could not believe this was John Grisham,"I don't know what this book was supposed to be but it definitely was not worth spending any amount of time on. The characters were unlikable, the story was boring and the ending was ridiculous.I have to admit that it got so laborious that I skipped much and just went to the end. I was a Grisham fan but lately have found his writing to have lost its intrigue. I think I have read his last book."
2,Fail. Terrible ending.,"This read was interesting enough pulp to pass the day. The ending seems designed for the movie theaters, however, and is a totally unbelievable solution to how $3 million might mysteriously land in the lap of an honest judge. Skip this one."
2,Don't answer it,"When I reviewed THE STREET LAWYER recently, I mentioned that I've never put down a Grisham unfinished and that we should throw the man some props. For that book, certainly. For this one, nope. I read four chapters, 41 of its 391 pages, and gave up totally unengaged and uncaring about any of his characters or his plot. I hope he just had an off day or something, and that what he wrote later got back to what makes him so readable."
2,Not Grisham's best but a decent read...,"This book just didn't keep me glued to my seat like his first book ""The Firm"". Why can't he write like that anymore? I expected something more out of this than Ray's father being given a friendly lump sum from Patton French. I expected more than the entire episode of harassment, deceit and stalking to be performed by someone other than his loser brother. I mean it's like Grisham was building up to something and BAM! he had a day that really sucked, got tired of this subject and just wrote a fast ending. I am really disappointed. Of course his knowledge and description of the law is nice but as to plot, this one wasn't that great. Where's the suspense? It's gone. He seems to be losing his edge. Thank God I borrowed this from the library and didn't pay good money for it."
1,Not that great,"I've liked the other Grisham books I've read, but didn't enjoy this one, and the ending left me flat. I'll be checking the Amazon reviews before reading any other of his works."
1,BORING!!!!,"Let me preface this by saying that I am a Grisham fan. Most of his books are terrific reads. However this one is boring, boring, boring. I read it two thirds through and put it down. I just kept reading and reading, expecting it to go somewhere, expecting something exciting to happen, and after getting 2 thirds through I gave up. It reads like Grisham was under a publisher's deadline and just started typing, putting in whatever came to mind. The problem is that it never goes anywhere. Save your money and read his other books - Runnaway Jury was great, so was the Testament, the Partner, and all the others I've read. But this one was a waste of time."
1,This is ridiculous,"John Grisham should know better... with the publishing of The Summons, he has really hit rock bottom. This book is so a to z formula that is should immediatly be a mass market paperback. I, as a Grisham fan, am sorry that I even read this ~350 page book. It is not a bestseller, it is not a good story, and until I hear otherwise, I will not read a John Grisham book again"
2,Slow and plodding!,"After two books(which I did not read) where he apparently ventured into different genres, Grisham returns to familiar territory of the legal thriller with 'The Summons'. The summons are received by Ray, a law professor, from his father, an ex small-town judge. Going home, Ray finds his dad dead but also finds a huge amount of cash and tries to determine the source.While the idea in 'The Summons' might have made an interesting short story, it is too flimsy for a full-length novel and so is stretched too thin. The red herrings are painfully obvious as just that as Ray eliminates suspects who may know about the money and way too much time is spent on this process. Worse, the revelation of the source is anticlimactic and doesn't match the build up. And after taking a leisurely route for most of the novel, the final portions seem rushed with the twist at the end being expected."
1,Not up to par,"I was looking forward to reading a Grisham novel, so I eagerly leap into the pages of ""The Summons."" By the time I completed the book, I was disappointed with the character development, story line and resolution of the novel. The word that struck me was ""flat."" This book does not have the depth and rapid-fire pacing of his other legal novels. I also found it interesting that this novel, based in Clanton, MS, does not even briefly mention the events which occurred in ""A Time To Kill,"" which also took place in Clanton. You would think a person from a law family who was reminiscing at times about his past would have brought up such a momentous event that occurred in his town. The storyline was weak and most of the characters were annoying. Harry Rex was the best defined character and the book was most enjoyable to read when he was on the page. I figured a key part of the mystery about 2/3 through the book. Not fun! No Grisham twists and turns here."
3,Not Very Exciting,I have read all of John Grisham's legal thrillers and this one is very average. The story was well written and interesting but there was no real suspense here. The characters were very good and the plot had potential. It was a fairly short book and while reading it I kept wondering when it would take off into a real mystery. Never happened. I would have to say I was disappointed.
2,Rather Weak,"While this book was a page-turner, and Grisham's style of writing is eminently readable, this book lacks depth. As with other Grisham novels, you're constantly waiting for the surprises and twists, but few arrive. The end of the story is lackluster as well, leaving the reader with a somewhat empty feeling.This book appears to have been written in relatively short order and without much forethought, resulting in one of Grisham's poorest efforts to date."
2,Not Grisham's Finest,"This book features the usual Grisham trademarks--well developed characters, interesting Southern locales, and a hero whose life appears ready for a change. These features draw the reader into the book. But once there, the plot meanders into a series of dead ends before bringing us to a predictable and unsatisfying conclusion.This is particularly disappointing to the legion of Grisham fans, of which I am one.I know you're goping to buy the book anyway, and it is a good way to kill some time. But don't expect this to be the second coming of The Firm, The Partner or even Missing Christmas. It's just a lesser effort by this outstanding writer. My prediction---this book will never be made into a movie."
1,Money over reputation,I never would have finished this one-dimensional bore if I hadn't been trapped on an airplane for 8 hours. This book lacks depth and the story is booorrring.
1,"Shallow, uninteresting, waste of time","I read many of Grisham's books. I liked most, loved some. But this one, my god, is a book which feels like written just for publication's sake. Uninteresting plot, unnecessary and boring details (why on earth that much detail about flying lessons, and was it really necessary for the brother to be an alcoholic?). I bet anybody can write a book like The Summons. Please do not bother to buy it or read it."
2,Do you think this was written for a movie script?,"I have loved some of Mr. Grisham's previous works, but not this one. Not to spoil the ending, but it was a HUGE let down. He gives many sermons on how bad money is, yet he rakes in millions. There is far too much time wasted on text that only drags the book out, but yet once it is cut out will make for an OK movie. My choice would be to wait for the video, no, wait until it is free on national TV."
2,A Dull Read Best Skipped,"This was the worst of the Grisham books. I cannot believe that some people are writing good reviews of this book. Grisham's book was not only boring, dull, anti-climatic, shallow, but also inaccurate in estate tax law. Mr. Grisham, if you write law novels, at least be accurate about the law! Giving this book two stars is charity."
1,What's happened to John Grisham?,"The last few books he's written haven't been up to his earlier works. And this is not just my opinion, but that of several friends who read his books. It's as if his publisher says, ""Okay, John, where's next year's book?"" And John sits down & pounds out a few hundred pages. ""The Brethren"" was great until it petered out at the end. ""The Painted House"" left much to be desired despite being such an acclaimed novel by the critics. And now ""The Summons!"" You could care less about the characters; they aren't people the reader can grow to like or care about. But the worst part of the book is that it reads like a 'day timer' or someone's boring diary. So I ask you, ""Whe-e-ere's Johnny?"" Did he employ a ghost writer after the first few books, or what? Come on, Grisham. Where's your enthusiasm? Go back & reread your books that made you one of the best authors in the world. Bring the muse out of your closet and recapture your love of writing."
5,"SORRY FOLKS, I LIKED IT","IT WON'T WIN ANY PULITZER PRIZES, BUT IT IS A NICE, LIGHT DIVERSION. I GIVE IT FIVE STARS NOT BECAUSE IT IS GREAT LITERATURE BUT BECAUSE I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN.I READ EVERYTHING GRISHAM WRITES (EXCEPT THE CHRISTMAS THING), AND MY OPINION IS THAT IT HAS BEEN PRETTY MUCH DOWNHILL SINCE THE FIRM. THIS ONE THOUGH, WAS FAST PACED, AND, UNLIKE MOST OF HIS WORK, IT APPEARED THAT GRISHAM HAD A PLAN FOR ENDING THE BOOK BEFORE HE STARTED WRITING. I ALWAYS ENJOY READING HIS BOOKS. MY COMPLAINT (EVEN WITH THE FIRM) IS THAT HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO END THEM. THIS ONE HAS A THOUGHT OUT ENDING."
1,Sympathy card,I am SO glad I didn't waste MY money on this book. I think I'll send a sympathy card to the friend I borrowed it from AND to John Grisham.
2,Diet Grisham,"I've read and rated highly several Grisham novels - The Partner, Runaway Jury and A Painted House are amongst his best. The Summons kicks off well but fails to deliver - it's a ""lite"" version and reads as if Grisham himself got a bit weary at the word processor writing it."
1,Boooooooooooooooring,"I've read almost everything by John Grisham. His early books were excellent. Some disappointed a bit, but still were quite a reading. This was the first one I could not finish. The endless trips to casinos and warehouses, all the same dejavu all over again...Sorry, Mr. Grisham, you had to drag youself through this. Hope, you can afford to retire now."
2,Disappointing,"I have always enjoyed Grisham's books, but honestly have not read one in a couple of years. Someone gave me a copy of ""The Summons"" and I read it while on vacation. After reading it, I decided that Grisham needs the vacation more than I do. It was a quick read, but should have been a 20 page short story. ""Man finds money, man keeps money, man loses money."" Sorry to give away the plot!"
2,So boring I suffered a coma,"The Firm is entertaining. A Time to Kill is problematic (from a moral standpoint) but entertaining. This book would have been more interesting if it was just wet driftwood tied into a pile along with rags. I gave it two stars because I managed to finish it, and because I appreciate Mr. Grisham's principled anti-death penalty stance (although that's irrelevant to this book)."
3,mediocre,"Not my favorite nonetheless an enjoyable book. If you haven't read Grisham before, I would recommend - The Firm, Runaway Jury, The Partner. Those will keep you up all night."
1,Don't waste your time,"I'm sorry, but this was one of the worst books I've ever read. Usually I like John Grisham books, and I was looking forward to reading this when it came out. The story was slow, nothing really happened, and the ending is so predictable that you want to ask for your money back. This could've been a good book, but the plot never developed."
2,A little different....,"I was hoping for another great legal thriller, but this fell somewhat short. I don't think the plot was developed enough or at least not to what I am used to for a Grisham novel. I hope this is not a sign of what is to come by Grisham."
3,"A nice, comfortable read","Certainly not his best, but entertaining nonetheless. A bit predictable in the end, but I'll have to say that I enjoy Grisham's incredible ability to paint characterizations and situations. Probably equal in plot quality to The Testament. So, if you liked that one, you'll enjoy The Summons."
2,HAVE A HEART JOHN,"Come on John, get a grip ! This book had a scrawny story line which you dragged out to the bitter end. They might be paying you by the word but please have a heart , there are people out there actually reading this stuff.Nothing much happened did it. It certainly had an intriguing start but the story remained paralysed and just edged along at a snail's pace and then went out with a whimper.Why on earth did you bother.. and why did I?"
3,Just glad to have a new Grisham book to read!,"Count me in with all the other disappointed Grisham fans. He is still a master storyteller. But if he wants to continue writing good stories, (and I pray he does!), Grisham needs to challenge himself a bit-maybe he could place his main character in a different setting (outside the south at least!) and spice it up with a bit of violence (ala Pelican Brief...was that his only true page-turner, characters-on-the-run thriller?) Are there any other authors writing good legal thrillers these days? I feel as though I've gone through all of the good and not so good ones (and there sure are a lot of Grishamwannabees out there who have no idea how to set up a scene and dialogue). John Grisham: please get inspired and write another Pelican Brief type thriller!"
1,Far from Grisham's Best,"The only reason I made it to the end of this book was because I kept hoping it would get better. The very thin plot line didn't get remotely interesting until about 40 pages before the end of the book. But by then, poor John had written himself into a corner. Using a pretty far-fetched device, he tries to neatly wrap up his one, lonely story line. But by then I had already figured out who the protagonist was. I wish he had explored the character of the lawyer with the yacht (whose name escapes me now). I wish I knew more about Forrest than the one-dimensional portrayal given. Oh well. This book could have been about 1/2 as long and still told the same story effectively."
1,Remember The Firm...?,"Remember The Firm? Rememer when JG used to create characters that we cared about? Remember when JG used to create suspense? Like when we discover that Mitch McDeer's house is bugged. Rmember when JG used to produce satisfying endings? Like when Abby asked Mitch if he'd ever made love on the beach and, after a brief pause, he answers ""uh, no."" Do we remember JG and what got us hooked on him in the beginning? I think we do, but I'm pretty sure JG does not.The Summons is a bad book. The eding is atrocious and totally unsatisfying. There are three charcters in the whole thing and we are supposed to have trouble figuring out who the bad guy is.JG, give us a little credit, the readers. The ones who pay your mortgage and send your kids to school.Remember us, JG. Remember who you're supposed to be writing for. Because if you keep putting out garbage like The Summons, we may just forget you."
1,Worst book I've read in years,"This book was so horrible I left it in my hotel room when I was finished. I should have thrown it out so that no one else would be subjected to it. Absolutely NOTHING happens in this book but stupid me, I kept reading hoping it would. It's a waste of paper, thankfully I didn't actually pay for it because it was a gift. It's a crime that authors get so successful they can actually abandon all the fundamentals of writing a good story."
1,I don't understand Grisham,"For the life of me I don't understand what's so great about John Grisham's stories, I've read The Testament, The Brethren and now The Summons and still haven't got it. The Summons was around 3 hundred pages describing the main character(Ray)running around with $3Million. The story had no depth and a very weak plot to say the least."
2,"Another waste - could have been good, but flops again.","John Grishman are so easy to read, I decided to read this one on the train. His books flow, are easy to follow, build up and then just drop flat. Not since his first 3 books has he finished one where you can put the book down and say ""wow"", that was great....I keep reading and probably will continue to, however, I am more and more disappointed. This book just ends."
3,Not his best book,"I read a lot of his books and I didn't think this one was one of his better ones--the subject matter was good but the book just ""stops""--it didn't seem to have an ""ending"" or give the reader any conclusions as to what happens next!"
3,Typical Grisham,"This is.a typical Grisham book. Lawyer wants money and lawyer finds money. Has lots of lawyer friends who handle divorce, medical malpractice and other ambulance chasing activities.One thing about Grisham, he may not ever win an award for his writing, but his stories are readable. The book, like his others is fast paced and a quick read.Shakespeare he is not; Chaucer, Hemingway and Fitzgerald have nothing to worry about - Grisham will never displace their literary positions. But, if you want a light read where the story telling is good, John Grisham has several novels that pass the teat. While I would not count this as his best (I reserve that for ""A Time to Kill""), the story in ""The Summons"" is interesting and I could see it really happening."
1,Shameful waste of time,"I read recently that James Patterson uses ""assistants"" to write drafts of his novels from plots he supplies then he supposedly edits and tunes them up. Grisham must have done that with The Summons, although no amount of tuning could fix this debacle. I won't give the ending away except to say that if you have one living neuron left in your brain, you'll be disappointed by it.Grisham and David Baldacci were terrific when they started but some of their later stuff is pure dreck. If an unknown writer copied this into manuscript form and submitted it, not an agent in the country would touch it while wearing a hazmat suit. It's that bad.It will be a lonnnnggg time before I waste my limited reading time on another Grisham novel."
3,Enjoyable,Not the best book I've ever read. But it was still entertaining. I thought the ending was good as well. I give it anout 3.8 stars.When I finishes I wasnt thinking that was a damn good book. But I wasnt dissapointed either.
4,"well... unlike many others, i liked it","it seems like Grisham's fans didnt enjoy The Summons. it was my first Grisham book, and i kinda enjoyed it. i guess you would like this book if you dont have any Grisham experience..."
3,A Dissapointment,"I'm a big fan of John Grisham, and this by far was his worst book. It was a very slow book, whereas it's usually a page turner.It's about how Ray Atlee found something in his father's house right after he died. Then he believes that someone else knows about the secret too.It's a SLOOOW book. Believe me. The ending wasn't even worth it. Quite predictable.If you've never read John Grisham book before, don't begin with this one, it's not a good assessment of his finest writings. Skipping Christmas was pretty bad too.I feel like I've given him too many stars. It should be two instead of three."
1,Very Disappointing,"I agree with an earlier reviewer. I will not be spending any more money on Grisham's legal thrillers in the future. I, too, was disappointed in his last few legal-related books but after reading ""A Painted House,"" which I thought was excellent, I decided to give him one more try. The writing in this book was at a grade school level. I only finished it because I kept hoping it would improve. It did not."
1,This book is a complete disappointment,"John Grisham really cheats his readers with this latest effort. Actually, he doesn't seem to have put much effort in at all. Throughout the book, I kept feeling that this was nothing more than a short story that he stretched into a novel. With so many other great authors doing wonderful work, this one is not worth the short time it will take to read."
2,The Summons,"Not Grisham's best. After ""A Painted House"" (my favorite Grisham book), I was disappointed. I love it when Grisham fools me with his ending, and it just didn't happen here. A couple of characters were used as throw aways - the Private Detective, and the potential new girl friend (student) were not used in the plot, and were useless characters. I would rate this about the same as ""The Chamber"", and ""The Street Lawyer"" - below my favorites ""Runaway Jury"", ""The Brethren"", and ""The Partner""."
3,Less than the others,"I enjoyed that the book was written in Grisham fashion--easy to read, but the plot just wasn't there like the others. The twists and turns were not as exciting, and the mystery wasn't as advanced. I feel that Grisham is one of the easiest reads out there these days, and it is good to pick up a book that is written so easy to read, but the story line needed to be a little more complex for the mystery-part to come through for me. I won't however, stop reading his works, because of the readibility of his writings."
2,Advertising might pay off.,"Grisham is an accomplished story teller. He has a pleasant style that allows you to sit and ""listen"" to his narative. However, this book takes forever to develop any excitement or mystery. It is strictly a story for 2/3 of the pages. The balance is predictable, and again not thrilling or enticing in any way. I like the fact that he does not deal in smut or gutter language, but please, John, do something for your money beside living off a couple outstanding novels. If you must read all the Grisham books, wait for the paperback, or go to the library for this one.Harry Smale"
2,DEFINITELY NOT JOHN GRISHAMS BEST,"I FOUND IT TO BE A VERY SLOW READ, AND AFTER WAITING FOR IT WAS DISAPPOINTING. THE STORY LINE WAS EXTENDED WAY TOO LONG AND THE ENDING WAS A NO BRAINER. READ THE BOOK AND JUDGE IT FOR YOURSELF. IT WAS NOT JG'S BEST WORK."
2,Don't bother...,"It seemed to me that John Grisham had a deadline to write a book for his publisher and scrambled to put something together. Unfortuntely, what he came up with is disappointing. The book is anorexic, there is no meat to this plot. It lacks substance and character development, and the plot is too simple. It ends abruptly, as if the required number of pages had been met. It pains me to say it, but don't waste your money."
2,Insipid ...and boring.,"This is by no means an ""adult"" novel. Probablya good one for middle-schoolers. Although neitherage group is likely to learn a new word ora catchy phrase after reading.JG should stick to writing about law."
2,Disappointed grisham fan,"I am a big fan of Grisham. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with this book. The story developed very slowly which was boring at times. And the ending, even though unexpected, is just not your usual Grisham's ending."
2,When will we return to Grisham's yesteryears?,"Oh, how I would love to fall in love with a Grisham novel again. It's been years! The runaway Jury was the last one that captured me. I liked Grisham's sidestep (a painted house). It was a well written book, but nothing I can't find with other writers. Grisham writes legal thrillers, so why is his last book no thriller? The story gets interesting around page 260 and the end is ok, but why must we sit through the motions of burial, lunch and sleepless nights? It's spring, I wanted to fall in love so much, but it's not there, the groundhog saw his shadow (and this book), 6 more weeks of winter."
1,Tale of Two Losers,"I find it hard to believe this book was written by the sameauthor as The Pelican Brief and The Firm. This book, a storyof two sons summoned home by their dying father, is simplyboring. Both sons are disappointments to their father andin life. And the reader is given no reason to really likeeither one.Ray comes home to find his father dead and a hoard of cashhidden in the house. He must decide whether or not to tellhis brother Forrest. But there is more to Forrest thanRay knows.Perhaps John Grisham should reread his early works to remindhimself how good he used to be -"
1,OH GOD HAVE MERCY,"I really can't believe that I wasted my money on this book. It was god-awful. From the cover to page (what seemed like) 5000, I was bored beyond belief. I really hope Grisham doesnt write any more books like this pile of Pat (Wong). Seriously guys, dont waste your money."
1,Fall From Grace,"The last 2 Grisham books that I have read have made me reconsider buying any more. Between 'A Painted House' and this one, I just don't think I can do that to myself any more. This one wasn't as bad as 'A Painted House' but that's not really saying much because they were both bad."
1,Disappointing,"Terribly predictable. Started slow, got a little better,then a complete let-down as it went on. Had the ending figured out long before the book stopped. His first books were good to excellent. Now feel that he's churning them out just for the money because there isn't a lot of thought that goes into his later works (this being the worst, yet). I had hopes, but was simply disappointed again."
4,He's back!,"Finally the John Grisham that gave us The Firm and The Client. No more preaching to his readers, just a good story that's hard to put down!"
1,My last Grisham book,"I've read all of Grisham's books, and this is my last! What a major disappointment. Given that his name alone garners millions of dollars in advances, I suppose he feels like he doesn't have to work as hard anymore. This book is pure lazy. It reads like it was written for an 8-year old. No complexity. No layers. Trivial grammar. Overly simplistic plot. It makes me sick that this man gets mega money for this type of work!Instead of Skipping Christmas, Grisham should have skipped The Summons!"
3,"Enjoyable holiday reading, but not exceptional","Enjoyable reading, but a predictable ending. The concept of the story was very appealing in the beginning, but towards the second half, a child good guess who was the bad guy... I liked this book, but I've had enough of Grisham for a while now..."
2,DON'T BOTHER,"I read this book, hoping that the next chapter would be better. The ending killed it. My friend asked me if maybe there was a chapter was missing. No such luck."
1,Grisham has lost the touch.,"I was initially excited that he'd finally written another formulaic legal thriller after the last two bombs. (A Painted House & Skipping Christmas). What a huge disappintment. This book was a very slow read and didn't get interesting until the last 100 pages and then had a dozer of an ending. I'm beginnging to think Grisham's given us all he has to offer. Oh well, it was fun while he lasted."
1,Won't be fooledagain,"I thought 'The Painted House' was one of the worst books I have read but 'The Summons"" tops it. What has happened to you, Mr Grisham? I will not be fooled again. I was a real fan of yours but now have lost all interest. It was apparent soon after the strange events began to occur who the real 'bad guy' was. Why couldn't 'the hero' figure this out for himself? Who else knew all about him? Oh well,I finished the book and tossed it so won't have tolook at it again.......nor will I buy any of Grisham's future writings."
2,Grisham shows us how not to finish a good mystery,"This one goes along like a good mystery - not too fast, and not too slow. The hero finds a good sum of unexplained money, and knows that somebody is onto him. It gets very exciting near the end, as he feels the noose tighten around his neck, but then, Mr Grisham lets us down in the last chapter. The book ends in a very unspectacular whimper. Left unexplained were several events, such as: Why the arson events? Why the threat to the IRS? Why didn't the bad guy just steal the money in the first place? Why didn't the bad guy know where the money was, given the extreme surveillance our hero was under (e.g., the photos of his secret storage sites)? Some ... no, correct that... most of the actions done by the bad guy didn't seem to be in his best interest."
2,Gotta Make That Payment on the Ferrari,"I give this book two stars because it is at least mildly entertaining. You read The Firm and then you read The Summons and you realize that John Grisham has either shot his creative wad or he's become too greedy and lazy to write at the level he achieved with The Firm...in The Summons Grisham starts off with a compelling idea but then seems to lack the will to develop that idea to its full potential. After a great start, The Summons turns into predictable, cliche-ridden boilerplate. It feels like a story that was ginned out in a hurry to meet a contract deadline..."
3,"Not completely horrible, not great...","If you're a fan of the early Grisham novels, you'll be a little bummed out about the lack of depth in this book. I was able to figure out the mystery long before the story ended.Although The Summons read like a junky ""McBook"" (i.e. short read, not terribly taxing, somewhat predictable), I was still entertained.I'm hoping the next one will be better."
3,The Summons,"While the book was good and kept me interested, it is not the best John Grisham book. The plot was intriguing but predictable and the ending was anti-climactic and a bit dull. I do recommend it but don't think you should get your hopes up too high before reading it."
2,Hoping for better,"Why can't John Grisham return to his original form of The Firm? Obviously The Summons was written as a character study and not a thriller. Usually I like that kind of novel, but this was extremely slow as we learned about the lives of The Judge, Ray Atlee, Forrest Atlee and several others who interacted with them. The plot is woven together with a thin thread - a father's death, the finding of questionable money and subsequent erratic guarding of it, worry about Forrest and his pitiful lifestyle, and Ray Atlee's irrational antics comprise the plot. It doesn't take much to figure out the ending which is dismal and predictable, but of course open for a sequel. This ends my buying a Grisham novel again unless it is in paperback. Maybe a library loan would be better!"
2,Serious lack of suspense,"After waiting for a new suspenseful Grisham novel, I am still waiting. The Summons was predictable and easy to figure out. It was hard to get into this novel because Ray Atlee wasn't the most likeable character and none of the characters were very interesting or admirable.I kept reading hoping for the story line to improve but it didn't. I hope Grisham's next novel is back to his high caliber of writing and suspense."
2,"Good Idea, Bad Follow Through",Started out with a good idea but had no substance to the story. Reader was left wondering what the point is to the book and then it all of a sudden ended. Grisham has just lost his touch as far as I'm concerned.
1,Lame!,"Several people I talked to as well as other reviewers arrive at this essence of this book when they say ""you just keep waiting for something to happen"" Grisham has fallen off my purchase list with this one!"
3,A Fire--Please!,"What can I say about this book. I have read just about all of Grisham's books. He is good.There is no doubt about it. His main characters are usually interesting and wonderfully likable. I loved the ""The Pelican Brief"", enough to remain up all night to finish it.Well, this book is different... All I can say at this point is since I am down to the last few chapters of the book. I believe that for the good of all concerned the money should have been torched immediately after being discovered. Surely no well-meaning and sane person would have retained a desire to keep a quantity of cash that they did not want and could not safely protect for the period of time that the character did. Why did we have to endure this insane running around with unwanted money? Who cares where it came from--I did a slow sinking into despair, wishing that he would just set the car on fire and be done with it all!!! Yes, John, ""The Painted House"", was great. Please try again. Thank You."
3,Relativity,"Everything is relative. A less than full effort Grisham ""legal thriller"" is still better than many other writers' best effort. We have come to expect more from Grisham - and don't get it this time. There isn't a whole lot of legal wrangling going on, nor is there the thrill ride of his earlier works.As some previous reviewers have said, there are errors of law and fact. I, too, kept thinking - ""Hey! Save stress! Stash the cash in a domestic Safe Deposit Box or Swiss Bank while figuring out `the rest of the story!'""""The Summons"" has its moments - but overall, it's a mediocre effort. Worst of all, we get an ending with no end. The fat lady never sang. If you are a huge Grisham fan, you have doubtless already rushed to buy this book. If you haven't purchased it yet, I recommend that you wait for a library copy and spend the money on a couple of his earlier paperbacks instead."
1,the summons,bro what happened to the ending this book indefinte their was no end please give some closure.
2,Simple Plot and not exciting,Not up to the usual plot that Grisham spins. Fast read (two sittings) but easy to figure out. Mr. Grisham is loosing it!
2,Not Quite Up To Par,I was sorely disappointed in the latest legal thriller of John Grisham's The Summons. No depth at all and very predictable. It seems like he was in a hurry to get this book out. I enjoyed Skipping Christmas it was a delightful short read and the Painted House was alright too. I have liked nearly all of his books except this one. Whats up John? Lost your touch? I rather wait 2-3 years for a really good book than so-so run of the mill ones every year.
2,Boring read,"This book was boring and predictable. The relationships between the characters were not believable, and characters that had no link to the story were introduced, for no good reason.If I didn't know who the author was, I would bet that it was written by a newcomer who ""knew someone"" at a publishing house and therefore got the book off the ground, but alas it was Grisham. What a shame."
3,"Quick read, but nothing special","I think that I regard my time reading this book as watching a few hours of decent TV (something like Sopranos). This book is nothing special, and nothing near the excitement and enjoyment of reading his classic books.I didn't read A Painted House on advice of my father (another Grisham fan). This book only took a few hours to read, and was mildly entertaining. My advice: Wait till it comes out on paper back."
3,Not the typical Grisham Book,"When I began this book, I was waiting for the true John Grisham to kick in, so to speak, but he never really did. The premise of this book is interesting enough: a man finds a fortune in his eccentric father's house, but Grisham almost fails to turn this plotline into a good mystery novel.I was waiting for the climax of the book through the novel, and was surprised when I reached the end, because I felt that the book never really reached an exciting pinnacle.I give Grisham credit for trying a slightly new style and storyline, but it just didn't seem to work out, and I hope he returns to his old, tried but true writing style."
4,The more I read...,"the more I love the writings of John Grisham. This is definately one of his shorter ones but it's not ""short"" on a good story. Sometimes a good, quick read is just the thing you need to make you feel better. I love having an author that I can just pick up and read and know it's going to be good."
2,Not a whole lot to this book,"No action, no threat to the characters in the story, and an ending that suggested that John Grisham was getting bored with the book. Not a good combination.Like all of his books, this one has pretty easy reading. If you want something that isn't to deep or complicated, go ahead and get this."
3,So so reading,"Latest novel by Grisham; somewhere between his best work (A Time To Kill) and his not-so-best (The Client). More recently, he seems to be gravitating back to good writing, after making enough money writing movie scripts that masquerade as books, I suppose. This book moves slowly until the near end, then suddenly it comes alive with many surprises. The story is about 2 prodigal sons and a father who dies while leaving a big question unanswered.Needless to say, the father is a judge (most Grisham characters end up being associated with the legal profession in one way or the other). The story follows the 2 prodigal sons as they come to Terms with the legacy left by their father and the realities imposed on them by their respective lives."
1,Disappointing,"A legal thriller--two lies in one: not legal and not a thriller!And, where was the ending?"
2,disappointed,"As someone who has read all of John Grisham's books, I found this one very disappointing. I was eagerly anticipating the newest book, and this one did not deliver. The only thing I found intriguing was the reintroduction of Clanton, Mississippi and of Harry Rex Vonner, one of Grisham's best characters. After reading The Summons, I went back and re-read A Time to Kill. There is no comparison. Grisham needs to the take the time to turn out a book like his first one. The Summons lacked the plot and the characters Grisham has been famous for in the past. I sure hope the next one is better."
1,Disappointed,"I'm a huge fan of John Grisham's, but his lastest here, The Summons was a big disappointment. Everything that leads you to the first page has huge potential, but the let down begins almost immediately. It seems you spend so much time lugging money around in the characters car that ""you"" get tired of the whole deal. While the ending did perk up, too little, too late."
5,Terrific!,I have read all of John Grishman's books including the more recent Skipping Christmas and A Painted House. I have thoroughly enjoyed them all. The Summons was not only suspenseful but charming and funny. I highly recommend it!
2,Disapppointing,"I was disappointed in Summons. It was slow and rather dull.While the writing is well done, the story is lacking and one could not help but hope it would end soon. Unlike his other books which had you on the edge of your chair."
2,"more of the same, but worse","I like Grisham's formula for legal thrillers, and I enjoy his breezy style of writing. This one, however, is pretty tired and I felt betrayed by the time I reached the end-- why did I spend good money on a hardcover? I recently read that Grisham has a couple more legal thrillers left to go for his contract, but it seems a disservice to the public that he be forced to write more when his heart clearly isn't in it anymore. I wish he'd just take a break, and when he feels more inspired to start again."
2,"Not up to the ""Usual"" Grisham standards of novel writing","John Grisham is one of my favourite writers - but his latest work left me unsatisfied. Not as well crafted as previous works, I started to get bored towards the end when the character (Ray) is hauling money back & forth from Charlottesville to Clanton, I felt Grisham just wasn't clear how to end to novel. And when it finally DID end, I wasn't happy.I was so looking forward to Grisham getting back into the lawyer/illegal scandel themes he is famous for, especially after his departure of The Painted House (which I forgive due to a mid-life crisis) and this work just isn't of the calibre of all his earlier work. Not a bad read, just not what I've come to expect in John Grisham"
4,Grisham Lite,"This Grisham book is not as rich and complex as his other books, but is quite entertaining, nevertheless. In this latest offering, law professor Ray Atlee has been summoned home by his father, retired Judge Reuben Atlee for a family conference. Ray and his brother Forrest have never been close to their father, and neither one relishes a return to the family home. Upon his arrival, Ray makes two astonishing discoveries which drive the rest of the book's plot. The book moves somewhat slowly at the beginning and it seems as if Ray spends a lot of time on the road between his home in Virginia and his father's place in Mississippi. Towards the end, however, the book begins to move faster and the reader is left with an interesting, if somewhat puzzling ending. Grisham's books are always worth a read."
3,Did not really go anywhere,I am a long time fan of Grisham. The Summons lacked the character development of his previous works and the ending left a lot to be desired. The book seemed to be always promising more then it just ended. I am a bit disappointed.
1,Such a thin plot!,"I bought this book for a plane trip and was so disappointed in it! I didn't care about the characters and the total plot could be condensed in 1 sentence. It was really dull. It just didn't have any intrigue and if I were John Grisham, I would be embarrassed to have my name on this book."
1,Don't respond to The Summons,"When you read a book by a favorite author and chapter after chapter is flat, boring, and lifeless, you keep going. After all, this is the author of ""The Firm"" and ""The Testament.""I'd rather have a root canal than re-read this book. The characters are flat, predictable, and lifeless. The plot goes nowhere and doesn't hold your attention. The ending is the worst I've ever read.Read a retail store catalogue, the obituaries column, ANYTHING other than this book."
1,Watching info-mercials a better use of my time,"Home with the flu and so thankful to have a new JG book to read, imagine my crushing disappointment upon finishing his latest work. I kept reading and reading, waiting for the plot to pick up, the characters to get interesting, the protagonist to become someone I gave a hoot about...It never happened. I was happy returning to Clanton, hearing about Claude's and the old courthouse, but it seemed a much more faded version than in ""A Time to Kill."" Even the incorrigible Harry Rex was an older, paler shadow of his former self.I haven't written anything more than this review, certainly not 14 best sellers, so I hate to criticize a person's livlihood--But this one should have stayed on the hard drive, and not been published. Loyal Grisham fans deserved better."
3,Rainy Afternoon,"Though not one of his better efforts, The Summons kept me interested. Grisham failed to develop a great ending, and he leaves the reader wondering, ""Is this all?"" Also, he should have put more effort into the development of Forrest's character - particularly since that would have supported Forrest's motives at the end. But overall, it's a cutesy plot that kept me guessing for awhile. I just wish he had spent more time on the ending."
3,A No-Brainer,"If you're looking for a book to read an a day or 2, then this is the one for you. It is an entertaining book, but its not an award winning story. I wish there was more of an ending. Sorry John, but its pretty ""formulaic""."
3,He's almost back in form.,"Grisham is almost back in form after the last two fiasco's he wrote. Painted House and Christmas something were awful. He still needs a better story line, but it wasn't bad. Diann"
2,The Summons by John Grisham,"This book is weak: weak plot, weak characters, weak writing. I felt that the publisher would not have accepted this book had it been submitted by an unknown author, and that Mr. Grisham cranked it out in order to meet some contractual obligation. I love his earlier books, especially The Client, and some of his later books at least gave him a chance to make the reader aware of some issues he cares about, but this book is just blah."
2,Author Cashes in on Reputation,"J.G. certainly is counting on name recognition to sell this book. The plot is pedestrian, and typical to a sophomore high school Composition class assignment. There is no twist to show creativity. The character development is weak. The pace of the book is slow and keeps one waiting for that Grisham excitement to grab us and hold our interest. Alas, it never happens. The ending is absurd: ""you lied to me!"" and the response ""well you lied to me too"". Gee, how original,witty and special."
4,Outstanding,"John Grisham has accomplished what many lawyers never learn, how to communicate. He writes with a style that readers can understand. Saying that. his plotting and style are spectacular as the new and old south sprinkled lightly as the first snow of winter. The characters become friends you have known for years but above all they are beleivable. The summons moves page by page toward a crecendo that shrewdly leaves you with a surprise ending. The most we can hope for is his next book will arrive sooner than later."
2,Guilty!,"I love Grisham books, however, after reading ""The Summons"", one has to wonder what has happened to the brilliant writer of John Grisham! I am guilty for staying up until 3am reading his book (over 2 nights), and am still wondering where the end of the book is! There are a lot of discrepancies, which seem to have been overlooked during the research and writing of the book. I enjoyed it, simply because of the author, but know that he has so much more in him. One upshot though, you can't beat the settings of his books. He describes them so thoroughly. Even though I know that some of the places are fictional, you can see the composite in Mississippi."
4,Suspenseful,"I have read all of Grisham's legal thrillers and am delighted that he returned to the setting of A Time to Kill (his first and best novel), Clanton, Mississippi. I was equally pleased that this was a pure thriller with lots of suspense. I found the moralizing of the Street Lawyer hard to get through.I flew through the first one hundred pages- forcing myself to slow down. Grisham quickly pulls the reader in with great characters and fast action. It slowed down a little, but it was truly supspenseful. The ending was lacking- I liked the plot twist, but found it a little hard to swallow.This was fast, fun- definately one of Grisham's better novels!"
3,The Summons,"Didn't like the ending. Also, thought the main character, Ray, was weak. I'd like my UVA law professors more forceful. The character's background didn't support the character's actions.Hope the next book is better."
2,"ugh, no way!","Dinky the Duck is really unattractive. I wouldn't buy this for a kid or for a decoration. I fail to see what's supposed to make it so impressive. I mean when I grew up I had really pretty stuffed animals that I could play with, but this? Dinky the Duck? It's horrible! I recommend avoiding it completely like the plague. It's not the kind of thing you want to see or even worse, trip over every morning. Avoid it please."
4,Uplifting and Entertaining,"Chandos and Maestro Hickox present us the Fifth Symphony in a framework of other works (some in premiere recordings) with a spiritual purpose, thus underscoring the searching nature of the symphony. This is a beautiful disk that is uplifting as well as entertaining, and marvelously recorded. Even if you already have several versions of this wonderful symphony in your collection, you will definitely want to add this one. Kudos go to Chandos for such a thoughtful production."
5,Iron Will,My husband and I really enjoy this movie that is why I purchased it to add it to our collection. It was well worth the price to have it to watch at any time we feel like watching a good/clean family movie.....
4,Such a great movie,Movie was in good condition and I just loved watching the movie. I had been searching for this movie for years but now I finally got it an cldnt be happier
4,Great,"I had this movie on VHS when I was growing up.When another Disney movie came out on VHS and DVD, I said to myself 'I should get that on DVD'. And so, I did.And now I have 'Iron Will' on DVD.Thanks!"
4,Good holsum viewing,"Disney can still produce a film where every family member can watch without being scadalized. The film is about a teenaged boy that enters a race that gives him an education from the school of ""hard-knocks"". Overcoming a seemingly fore-gone conclusion, Will (the main character) continues the race casting greed and cheating asunder. And kudos to Aston McKinsey (playing Will) for real acting in the bitter cold, snow, and dark of night!! No special effects here; everything is the real mccoy!"
5,The best movie ever!,We have had this movie on VHS for several years and now we have it on DVD. It will always be in our movie library. It is one of our top family favorites and we love to show it to those who have not seen it before. Everyone loves it and we never mind seeing it over and over. It's based on a true-life story. It's adventurous and inspiring. Awesome movie!
5,GOOD FAMLY MOVIE,"MY HUSBAND AND I BOTH ENJOYED THIS MOVIE AND IT IS A GOOD MOVIE FOR OUR COLLECTION,AND TO PASS AROUND."
5,happy customer,"i ordered a video i couldn't get in Australia, it was easy to order, arrived before xmas and cost about the same as it would have in a retail shop; thats including postage."
3,Iron Will,"Iron will is about a boy who fights for his fathers dreams and his.He becomes more urgent to win the race his father was to join, while racing to the finish line.and never giving up on the goal he and his family set for him."
2,Boring dumb stupid,"I think people may be mixing this up with White Fang- I did! This movie was just idiotic. I gave it 2 stars because Spacey made it (barely) watchable. But without Spacey, it's nothing."
5,"Love, Iron Will","I, love this movie, A) because I love huskies! (we have 2). B) we have had it on VHS for years and always have loved it, so this year we upgraded to DVD. C) It's hard to find family movies these days that don't have a political underlying agenda, this movie is just a good movie with a strong sense of family and the sacrifices that are made to secure that family. LOVE IT! LOVE IT! LOVE IT!"
5,Best Family DVD I HAVE SEEN IN YEARS.,"I would recomend this movie to be watched by the entire family. It is friendly, heart warming, and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Was a great buy..."
4,One Of Disney's Better Efforts,"How much of this story is true is up for dispute. I suspect most of it is highly exaggerated. Nonetheless, it is inspirational and fun to watch: an excellent adventure tale.The movie reminded me of ""White Fang"" with the winter scenery and the young hero, played by MacKenzie Astin, looking and sounding much like Ethan Hawke. The story was simply about a dog-sled race in the early part of the 20th century.The picture is beautifully shot, especially the train scenes, and looks very good on DVD. The villains in here aren't as despicable as in other films, so it's more pleasant to watch. I enjoyed the entire story except for the whistling at the finish line which was a bit stupid, but that's minor.This is one of Disney's best live-action films."
4,Iron Will Video,"Iron Will (Clam)During 4 weeks of fine snow, my grade 6 class often had ""dog"" sled races for phys-ed, as the teamwork warm-up for tobogganing. They loved it and were eager to learn about dog sled races; the Iditarod and others. It even integrated into our unit on Native peoples. As a finale, when the snow was fast disappearing we watched Iron Will. They were impressed with the determination and optimism that Will carried throughout the challenge."
5,About enduring to the end against all odds.,"Great movie! ""Iron Will"" is a great role model for kids. Ignore the critics and cynics: this movie is inspiring. Watch this with your kids and provide a little character building experience for them...a refreshing change from all the other garbage movies out there with which the critics seem so enamored. This film reinforces so many values: play fair, finish what you start, help others, follow your dreams by working hard to achieve them. This is an Awesome A+ movie!"
4,Iron Will eludes the glamour boys who review for big bucks,We're watching this and I just came up to order it for my friend's boys. It's a young boy's movie and quite a different setting and quite different people than the normal fare. It shows my part of the world and it's history. It's fun.
5,Iron Will,Received this item quickly and in perfect condition. One of my favorite films and I'm glad to be enjoying it again.
4,great movie,"i like movies whit dogs,for example old yeller and the incredible journey. Iron will,another great movie,shows the power of dogs in the cold alaska wilderness. A 17 years old boy tries to save his mothers farm, in 1917. He tried to win 10000 dollars to save the farm. A movie with a lot of excitement! Buy it,NOW!"
2,First CD attempt that was lack luster from her vocal skill,"I first saw her in the movie ""And Now ladies and gentleman"", and Patricia was absolutely mesmerizing and breathtaking in her vocal skills! I enthusiastically went on a hunt for her albums, and this one is quite a disappointment!!! I should've bought ""Piano Bar"" instead. Very surprised that this album just doesn't make the cut of bringing out her best."
3,No additional pictures from Patricia???????,"My 2 complaints about this album: First, it doesn't have the lyrics; Second, no additional pictures from Patricia in the inside cover.For what I listened I realize her best albums are the 2 latest ( Dans ma chair & Mot de Passe ). My favorite song, though, is ""Je voudrais la connaitre"" ( from those I hadn't listened before). Although if you are a new fan will probably like the classic "" Il me dit que je suis belle"".Nice production.... but it could have been better."
5,electricity is fun,"One of those small things that make life a tiny little bit easier. It is not very often that a battery post starts leaking acid, but when that happens, corrosion starts to eat the metal. A simple washer between the battery and the cable clamp costs next to nothing and slows the corrosion down significantly and doesn't add much to the weight of the vehicle.It is still important to check the battery every once in a while, of course."
2,Not made in USA,"I was going to buy locally but noticed they were made in China so I waited and ordered from Amazon, as I remembered the picture of the package shows ""Made in the USA"". Amazon's image of this product is incorrect. The Coleman 989's I received were made in China (from who knows what)."
2,An embarrassment for Stockard Channing.,"I was sorely disappointed with this film. Stockard Channing is supposed to be a newly-promoted CEO, and Julia Stiles is a young assistant with the firm. While working together in the same city, giving various presentations on behalf of the firm, they end up getting to know each other while staying in the same hotel. Stockard invites Julia to her room for drinks, where she learns that a headhunter she had been using (and who is also staying at the same hotel), raped a friend of Julia's a few years back. Julia supposedly gets Stockard to try and kill the headhunter, but he ends up surviving. It was a completely implausible scenario.... a CEO befriending a young assistant of the firm virtually overnight, drinking in front of her, and then allowing herself to be swayed to kill someone. Not only that, but how often have we already seen films of women taking things into their own hands, and venging the rape of another woman? It was total garbage!"
1,What in the world was the point?!?,"I didn't understand this movie. It started out real slow and never picked up. I do NOT recomend this movie to anyone. It moved from scene to scene with out a strong plot or story line. Although some people may like this type of movie I did not and would strongly recomend not even bothering watching this movie. Anyway, Have a nice day! BYE!"
1,Lame Film,"Very predictable with lame screenplay. Disappointing film for such fine actresses. Would NEVER recommend. Just awful, in spite of the cast. Vendor did a great job on getting the product, as promised, to me. Would recommend the vendor, not the film."
3,"Sharp, but ultimately not well directed","The movie is a bit of a polemic against male dominatedsociety. On that level, it works -- better than most scriptsof this type, really. Channing really eats it up and puts ona very nice performance. Stiles seems surprisinglyunprepared for the part, and at times is too transparentfor me to take her that seriously.Other notes: The videography is a bit dreary, apparently onpurpose. I don't like it. The male lead does his best, and Ithink they chose well, but let's face it, he is a hood ornamenton this one. The first part is slow, and later it picks up; theunevenness of pace is annoying in that way. The setsare sort of cheap. The quality of this one as DVD is prettyminimal. Stick to a rental."
5,Best garbage can bands available,I've been buying large rubber trashcan bands the last few years but they rot and break after a year. These bands are small bungie cords - very well made. Would recommend them to anyone to keep trashbags in place. I use them on 45 gallon trashcans.
1,Mis-represented product,Band was advertised as fitting 45+ gallon cans. The product actually is good up to 30 gallon containers and is labeled as such. A lousy way to make a sale!
5,Finally,No more trying to figure out how to keep my garbage bag up and over the garbage can. Yes... it's a simple bungee cord like band - but it is exactly what I needed and I am 100% satisfied. It took an awfully long time to get it for such a small thing. But overall I am very satisfied with this product I bought on Amazon. I have yet to be disappointed with any of my Amazon purchases - nor have I ever had to return anything. Thank you Amazon!
2,Wrong product,"This product description has XT written all over it, but when I received it, it was definitely NOT XT. The packing slip also said that it was XT inside. I called the place from which I received it, and they said they don't even carry XT. Beware, this is the Ultra product, not Ultra XT."
3,Ceci n'est pas un livre de voyage,"When trying to picture yourself Angola after having read this book, you probably would come up with just an empty land. But pretty much as the editorial review promises, that empty space is filled with stories. Stories from ordinary people who have extraordinary things to say. Stories about corruption, lost loves, lost limbs, lost homes and stolen cattle. The stories are being alternated with some of the harsh travel moments from the writer. Nothing seems to have a beginning, an end nor a goal, it all seems to come down to lost hope. The poetic and sometimes even surreal approach doesn't make this one a sad or a desperate read though. But it doesn't make the book a page turner either.(reader of the Dutch translation)"
3,Old school sword fighting,I rate this film a 3 star effort no fabulous sword lighting techniques in this film a good story and 2 great stars Lo Liel and Yueh Hua.
4,Rorscach Test does it again,"I first experienced Rorschach Test at the Ministry concert here at the Paramount. I've been a Test-head ever since. This is a mix of styles, ranging from Nine Inch Nails to White Zombie-ish power chords. A brooding, dark, and excellent CD. This is much better than their previous effort, ""The Eleventh,"" though that Cd can hold its own as well. This CD is one of the best industrial albums around. Highlights include ""Satan,"" ""Sex,"" Wheel of Misfortune,"" ""Monster,"" and ""Unclean."" Pick it up people, you wont be sorry."
4,Yee-Haw!,"Ghoultown couldn't put out a bad album if you held a 6 shooter to their collective temple. These guys consistently put out hard core gothabilly that could make you shiver in your velvet, here, gothy kids! I personally took a chance and bought the Album That Started It All, and this one is a gem!"
1,Indoor or Outdoor?,"Product title days oudoor, but the Technical Details section says indoor use only. Which is it?Feel free to delete this review when the problem is fixed."
2,Need a Strategy guide,This game I got for free from a friend. It works okay. Sometimes it crashes when its loading between maps. But other than that its alrite. but the game has too much needed knowledge. They don't tell you where you can find things. No survival skills needed. Also i hvae no clue where to find my way and missions. The maps in the game doesn't give you Ideas of where to go. and you get lost easily. Its an okay game but its really not worth its full original cost. Who knows of a Strategy Guide?
1,Too Bad - Potential is Definitely There,"If you are a fan of Chinese themed games, you may think at first that you want to try this game out. DON'T. Basically, you are the first son of Qin Shih Huang Di, the first Emperor of China. While you are responsible for the troops in one of the northern outposts, your father died, leaving the throne yours to claim. One of your younger brothers is plotting with one of the most powerful ministers to kill you, and ordered the troops to arrest and kill you. Once a king-to-be, you are now a renegade - wanted dead for being the crown prince.Sounds good? Here is the problem. The graphic is extremely lacking, since the game seems to be using 256 color palette rather than 16 or 32 bit colors. Also, the game tries to replicate Diablo II but it failed to replicate the one thing that makes people play Diablo II - playability.Overall, I give it 1 star since I cannot even bear playing the game. I love Chinese based games, but this game is just too much."
4,Very fun if not a bit old school,"I played this game years ago, and it is just as fun now as it was then. The graphics are great considering the resources of the time. I've heard negative comments about the music, but that is one aspect of the game that I particularly love. If there was a soundtrack I would get it. The only reason why I give this 4 stars is that I accidentally bought a bundle game disc that included a bunch of unnecessary games. If this was the only item, it would have been a full 5 stars."
1,Buyer Beware,"I thought the setting sounded like it would make an interesting change from the standard European fantasy world so I downloaded the demo and tried it out. It ran fine on my system, which meets and exceeds the recommended system profile on the retail box, so I bought the full version of the game. Turns out that while the demo runs fine on my system, the full version won't run at all. Strategy First's tech support has largely consisted of telling me to make sure I have all the latest drivers, I do, and to uninstall and reinstall the game, which I have. The game still doesn't work so they've kicked me up to their 2nd tier tech support who haven't bothered to contact me in over a week. Don't buy this game unless you're prepared to return it in the eventuality that it doesn't work on your system."
1,A LITTLE MORE INFO WOULD BE HELPFUL AT LEAST THE TRACK LISTI,"WHEN YOU DON'T EVEN SHOW THE TRACK LISTING TO THIS CD, HOW IS ANYBODY SUPPOSE TO MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT TO BUY IT? I AM REALLY INTERESTED TO KNOW WHAT SONGS ARE ON THIS CD BUT WILL NOT BUY IT UNTIL I KNOW! SHABBY ADVERTISING!!"
5,Wow! So helpful,"I would recommend this as a third book after reading ""The Power of Now"" and ""A New Earth"". This book answered so many of the specific questions I had about how to bring consciousness into my life. have the audio version, and keep it in my car. For me, hearing Eckhart Tolle read his books adds a level of understanding that I just don't get when I read them myself."
5,Coach,Excellent quality. Fast shipping too. Great training tool for perfecting a solid swing. I would use this product for kids from six years and up.
5,Peter Weller Rules!! Great Cop Movie!!,Peter Weller rules starring as a correct cop on an unstable road.It's a must see at a great price!!!
4,"Good product, great series","my daughter has the chinese, spanish and french editions. the songs are great. i especially appreciate that the songs are the same in each edition. that repetition makes it easy for children to learn the songs in various langauges."
1,too difficult and no fun,"My six year old received this toy as a gift. We thought it would be great fun but were very disappointed. The startup sequence is too difficult for young children to follow. The techno music is not great for much of anything, although you can use your own music if you have an I-Pod. I'm amazed at how much is costs, given the poor system design.I would NOT recommend this product for anyone. Don't waste your money."
5,Beatiful voice of greek music,"Anna Vissi especially her CD Antidoto is one of the best I've ever listened...You gotta have this Cd if you like greek music...I also suggest you to try Elefteria Arvanitiki , George Dalaras, Despina Vandi, Haris Alexiou..."
5,Awesome~!,"First off, let me say that I'm 20 years old, and have loved scooby as long as I can recall! So I don;t really use this as a toy per se. It is a desk adornment for me, but I still giggle a little bit every time his head bobbles. I love it! Recommended for anyone needing a handsome decoration or a fun something for whatever reason."
3,Guessing Game,"Great product, great vendor. My distress, is because I have bought several of these, and Nikon does a bad, bad job of relating the pouch part number with the lens that fits it. So you go back and forth to Nikon's web site looking for a part number that is on a lens that may be similar. Then you order. It's a guessing game."
1,To complicated,Dont waste your money. the games are to complicated for 2-3 graders. The act of moving the block and your figure around is the problem. I had a hard time figuring out the game. Stick with jumpsart games. They are better.
3,Its alright,"Gorgeous, but hurts. The little tab that lines the back of the heel sticks up, and rubs against the area where the heel and the back of the leg meet."
4,i like the heel,"this pair of sandal is a little bit big, so select half size smaller than your regular size. very nice shoes!!! i love it!"
5,Loved this book,"This book breaks down most of the confusing stats jargon in a way that almost anyone can understand. I really struggled with stats in college and this book combined with SPSS made me wonder why I ever thought it was so difficult! I highly recommend this book for anyone looking to measure program performance or for those working on a thesis or dissertation that deals with quantitative analysis. However, this book does not break down the stats equation but expects you to have software, such as SPSS to do that for you. It focuses more on interpreting data that has already been calculated with software. The book also details case studies to help you determine which type of process/test to use to maximize validity. All in all, I highly recommend this book."
2,Item pictured is no longer made,"Be aware that the item you will receive is not chicken strips as pictured. Plato no longer makes chicken strips, but rather formed pieces which are called Plato Organic chicken and sold for less on Amazon. The seller would take no responsibility for the wrong picture, nor would they refund to me the difference between what I thought I bought, and the other product, which they also sell, for less."
2,Maybe the uncut version is better... who knows.. and i dont care,"""Skip Day"" is about a student who screws up the 'skip day' party by letting the principal know where it was to be held. He redeems himself by having the party at his place.The plot, if you can call it one, is the principal trying to find where it is to bust it but is sent on a wild goose chase instead, all while the dork having the party wants to win over a girl, but the girl is taken by a guy who is the typical moron that is only after one thing and is typically cheating on her and doesn't deserve her and ...euhh... blah blah blah blah... you know what comes next.Nothing original, and nothing that stood out well enough to call it memorable. See it if you can't get enough of the party movies, but don't expect anything to have you rolling on the floor with laughter.Edit: well, it's now 2011, and I have no recollection of ever seeing this movie. Guess that proves what I said about it being memorable!"
2,Very disapointing,"Since watching the Reanimator films and loving them, I have taken to reading stories by H.P. Lovecraft and I can only wonder what he would have thought of this movie. While scary and gory, it seemed rather intelectually shallow, unlike Lovecraft's written work. I kind of liked the wimpy hero here as he seemed like the type of everyman so prominent in Lovecraft's stories, however the ending just left me empty. It was contrived and poorly done. Where did the tentacles come from? Dagon was supposed to be some kind of fish god or at least that's what I understood. There may have been some other technical problems like the car starting after the wires were ripped out and gills on people in different areas of their bodies but I could live with that. Sorry, but this one just was not enjoyable."
3,low budget take on Lovecraft,Aren't they all though? Not bad for what it is but not a terribly notable film.
5,Carefully crafted gem,"I've been a Stuart Gordon fan since I saw Re-Animator in high school. While I still enjoyed some of his follow-up work (From Beyond and Bride of Re-Animator) I got the feeling he wasn't really trying.Not so with Dagon. This is a creepy, atmospheric masterpiece. They didn't spend a whole lot of dollars on the production, but every single one of them shows up on screen.I rented it on VHS last night, but I'm buying it on DVD today. (If nothing else, I need subtitles to find out what the hell that old spanish guy was saying.)Highly recommended."
1,"So, so bad","Stuart Gordon snoozerama. Filmed in Spain, with a 99% Spanish cast and all Spanish crew. Reminds one of bad Argento or Polanski, maybe even 70's Italian spatter. Only if you have seen every movie on the New Release shelf at Blockbuster should you try to rent this. Loved Re-Animator, nearly fell asleep on this meandering night of the living dead nonsense. Only scene worth your time:some guy gets his face pulled off, slowly, and with nary a flinch from the camera. I'm stingy with my stars, though. HP Lovecraft deserves better."
4,"very imaginitive, indie, and quite brilliant","its a low budget film, some bad computer effect and ocassionally bad acting, but it still works. the lead is just likeable and the setting of the film is just outstanding. they even made this a xbox game called dark corners of the earth(call of cthulhu). its that popular and quite scary. i really loved it and recommend it to any horror fan who likes lovecraft, clive barker or just creative horror. if you dont like some camp, you wont get it. but its films like Dagon by stuart gordon that really just shine and you can tell they have a love for the macabre. i loved it. would have given it 5 stars but the effects should have been done away with and focused more on other things, when you see the boat crash, its like a ps2 game. some of these cgi scenes are pretty bad. but other than that, great horror film!"
3,No Masterpiece----but damn creepy,"I saw this film on SciFi twice and it has the creepiest atmosphere of any movie I've ever seen. I don't feel like writing a huge comment, so....if you like horror and want to see someone execute a film well, watch it...if you are just lookin for a campy horror or award-winning movie, don'tEDIT: and what scene is it that is SOOO grissly....please i'd like to know...maybe it didnt come on tv"
3,3.5 for this creepy little movie,No its not a state of the arts...special effects type of movie...but morelike a good book...it delivers.Interesting script and creepy villagers is a good mix and this is not aplace you would like to get stuck in ....not even visit.I was able to watch this movie in one session... and its worth it.Enjoy
3,Good enough...for a straight to video,"By no means should anyone expect anyone to do credit to Lovecraft without a large budget in addition to ever larger stores of talent and love for the author. In any case, the entire point of reading books written before the golden age of Hollywood is that they ARE BOOKS, not potential movie scripts.That said, this flick is fun, some gore, some blasphemy, some gratuitous nudity, and if you like it, pick up one of Lovecraft's time machines...if you dare.Bwa ha ha ha!No, seriously, they'll exercise your attention span and language centers so much TV will never be the same."
2,Chtonic Underachiever,"It's about growin' up! I previously gave this film a poor review on my first watch. Well, I'm here to announce I watched it a second time and I must have been on drugs or something. It is a great trashy horror flick, with some moments of real horror. So it's not so bad."
2,Should have stayed at the bottom of the ocean,"Aside from being a ""somewhat"" faithful adaptation of the H.P. Lovecraft classic ""The Shadow over Innsmouth"", this film falls short of the mark and relies entirely too much on gore, schlock, and gratuitous nudity. Of course there is a time and place for that. This film is not it. As far as the ""acting talent"" is concerned, I didn't know F list actors even existed if that gives any indication of the caliber of talent stocking this film. 98 minutes of my life that I will never get back. The only reason I gave it 2 stars rather than 1 is because it's the team that gave us Re-Animator, and they appear to have read the short story. To sum it up in a word G R O S S!"
2,Not one thing or the other.,"August 13, 2002I rented this one on a lark. I liked ""Re-Animator"" quite abit, and I hoped it might be similar. I found it lackingon one hand as a gory, Grade 'B' horror flick and on theother as a Lovecraft interpretation. The moral, I guess:beware credits that list unknown European actresses andforeign television production companies."
2,Uh....no thanks,Great lead in and first couple scenes....then it goes rapidly downhill. Not a good movie. No...no...uh..no. Even the exotic location and sets can't save it. Pass....
3,I am not quite sure what to think,"This movie is so strange. The plot of the movie was???? It was a weird movie and I really didn't care for it. It just wasn't scary, just really weird and the characters. Weird is all I can say."
2,"Just WOW to the reviews, wow, all I can say","After reading review after review about ""atmospheric"" and how ""creepy"" this film is, I broke down and bought it. And, just like every other awful adaption of Lovecraft, it is a letdown.I don't know where or how they cast the leading men in these roles. The story is original, but can you get past the awful acting?The story may have you saying ""huh""? Some evil man comes to a small fishing town and makes them all convert to octopus worshipping. They all start turning into fish people. You'll be puzzled and amused more than creeped out or scared."
2,I've seen a lot better.,"Unlike what else is being said here, I found this movie to be actually quite humorous just in its poor quality. I will say that humor is much in the same style of the last two movies in the Evil Dead trilogy EXCEPT our Dagon hero can't act. The special effects we're pretty bad as well. In fact, this review is starting to not even be worth my time. Just take my advice. If you REALLY want to watch this, rent it first!!! Get it on VHS if you can in order to avoid the extra [X] DVD charge from Blockbuster..."
1,"No, just no.","If I could have given this less than 1 star I would have. It is horrible, quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. I am a fan of less than box-office hit movies, (So to say ""B"" movies) but Dagon is by far the stupidest of them I have ever seen. If a movie that makes you actively want the main character to die (preferably the most painful death your numbed brain can come up with) is a movie you want to see, Dagon is perfect. However, if you want to actually enjoy a movie (and avoid a few months of nightmares in witch an irritatingly scrawny likewise pale man is dying), stay far far away from this movie.PS: Only people with great empathy would consider those nightmares, as a normally detached person would be the one killing IP,LSM. (Irritatingly pale, likewise scrawny man)"
3,A decent remedy for the post-modern slasher movie blues,"I'm not all that familiar with H.P. Lovecraft... I've read a couple of stories but not the ones that this movie is based on. I'm approaching this strictly as a movie buff who gives the horror genre more credit than most do. Recently the genre has gone adrift with ""Scream"" knock-offs, but ""Dagon"" is played refreshingly straight. The first half or so was particularly good, with a nice set up and a genuinely creepy atmosphere. The fish-people are pretty hard to tell apart from your basic movie zombie, but the movie manages to keep them creepy without falling into camp. The music, sound, and cinematography are certainly the movie's strenghts. The chase scenes get a bit repetitive and my interest waned during the last act, but after the movie was over the atmosphere still lingered."
4,A Salute to the Lovecraft Mythos,"Based on the MANY poor interpretations of the works of H.P. Lovecraft, one would generally be swayed away from watching anything that claimed to be based on his work. But every once in a while, there comes a movie that successfully claws its way out of the sludge and backwash the other films leave behind. Dagon is such a movie.Not only is it wonderfully accurate, but also envelops the whole notable dark and disturbing atmosphere that is so important to the writings of H.P. Lovecraft. Also, there are many little things in the movie that only Lovecraft readers would grasp onto... the reference to Miskatonic University, and the town ""En Boca"" in which the story takes place, cleverly means Innsmouth. I highly suggest this movie to anyone who is a fan of the genre... they will not be disappointed."
2,"My son 3 y/o is addicted, but I am disapointed.","I don't think Disney Interactive has a Quality Assurance department. The usability of the game is awful. There is an option to reconfigure the controls, but it's still difficult. I have yet to figure out how to save the game. Supposedly you can do it between levels, but I haven't figured out how. There are simple graphical errors that should have been fixed pre-beta. When you finish a level, a box appears in the middle of the screen, so you can't see what Lilo or Stitch are doing when they've completed their task. Based upon the movement of the surroundings, it looks like they're doing something or walking somewhere. I wouldn't know, I can 't see them. Over-all, thumbs down. But my three year old loves it. Too bad I have to play it so much, because he can't jump over all that water."
1,The worst graphics on any game I've recently played,"Disney isn't known for great games (in my opinion), but they hit an all-time low with this one. The game controls are awkward, and the software wouldn't even run properly on our Windows XP computer. However, the biggest disappointment was with the graphics, which are incredibly bad. I feel that this game is a complete rip-off and should be avoided unless you really want to give a present to a someone that you don't like (heck, that would be too cruel)."
2,Hard to Control for Young Children-I Wish I'd Save My Money,"What a great company Disney is - What a cute title Lilo & Stitch ""Trouble in Paradice"" for ages 7+ - I only wished there was some way I could get my money back - I tried to play it - I am 50+ the controls are VERY HARD to figure out - to easy to get yourself ""killed"" - my 8 year old grandson was so disappointed - the graphics are a little bit to ""square-ish"" but cute but that is about all it has going for it - I have opened my copy so I know I can't send it back to ""Toyrus"" - if only I could I would request my money back - I don't understand why Disney has to make all of controls on their games so hard - I also don't understand why places like Toyrus cann't list the ""controler"" useage in their write up - if they had of and I knew it was all keyboard controled I know I WOULD NOT have waisted my money on it - unless you are a ""die-hard"" Disney fan - SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!"
4,The Pritikin Health Library : The Pritikin Program for Diet,This is a wonderful book. It was an easy diet to follow. I used the diet one summer and lost fifty pounds. My only regret is that I did not buy the book when it was still in print. It gives case studies and tells how the diet works. Then it gives you the diet and recipes to follow. It's great.
5,Wikid tunes!,"Show me love has to be on of the best songs ever - its a mix of rnb and pop. Dya kno wot it takes is a cool song, a drop of old skool mixed with rnb - these 2 songs r phat! Robyn has to be one of the best singers ever and writes and produces all her own songs. Y doesnt she get the recognition she deserves? If you like this, check out her albums ""Robyn is Here"" and ""My Truth""."
2,leaf through before you buy,"Many curent puzzle books feature puzzles that are just old chestnuts dressed up in more modern language or settings,and this book, I'm afraid, is one of those.Well, maybe I'm being a bit too critical. It's an OK collection if you're new to puzzles. But if you're a seasoned puzzle person, you really should leaf through it and judge by yourself whether it's good enough to fork down your hard earned dollars.Oh, and the Mensa stamp of intellectual arrogance on the cover? Believe me, as a collector of puzzle books, it's no guarantee that the puzzles inside are that much more original than average fare - in fact, I find it downright pretentious."
2,Overpriced,"This is one of three similar anthologies on Burma travel writings that has appeared recently. Unfortunately the book is overpriced. It is printed on poor quality paper in India. For my money the TRAVELLER'S HISTORY OF BURMA or INROADS INTO BURMA : A Travellers' Anthology are excellent, cheaper and have better quality paper."
1,Dissapointed,This pedal absolutely kills the tone of the instrument. If you don't have the threshold turned to max it won't kill the hum but if it's turned to max it kills the tone. I returned it and got the ehx hum debugger instead and it doesn't kill the tone. This pedal was a huge let down. I expect more from rocktron because most of their stuff is of quality build but it's like they quit halfway through with this pedal. I recommend the EHX or the ISP if you want to kill the hum.
1,BEWARE OF FAKES from Discount Jungle,"Great product when you get the genuine artile Alpine KCE-422i. Unfortunately I bought mine from Discount Jungle who advertise Alpine cables, then send cheap fakes to all of their customers. I tested one of them and it didn't even work properly. They told me they'd give me a refund if I sent them back. I returned the cables and was given only a partial refund. After a great deal of effort, I got some more of my money back, but they refused to fully refund me. Fortunately Amazon refunded me the rest of the money after I made an Amazon A-Z Guarantee claim. Thank you very much Amazon! I would never ever under any circumstances buy anything from Discount Jungle."
3,Alpine kce 422i,This cord works great only downside is it DOES NOT CHARGE .. Still a happy customer just wish that there was a warning stated about the charging issue
1,This Cable is Garbage!!! It disassembled as soon as i opened it.,"This cable is garbage, and that's exactly where my last two purchases went form amazon. I'm sure it's not the website, maybe i just have bad luck and always run into bad purchases."
3,iPod cable,I bought this thinking it was necessary to see video from my iPod Touch...I was wrong. But it is useful if you have an older version iPod.
1,Fake,"I wanted to cancel the order but, it had already shipped. I had explained that I was told it was a fake and would not work. I told Discount Jungle what I had heard and they didn't deny the fact. I was told return information would be in the package that was sent. Nothing but the phoney cable was in the package. I went to Best Buy and bought a cable from them as it was necessary for the Christmas Gift. I wasn't sure the cable I got from Discount Jungle was going to work."
1,Terrible Buy Knock-Off,The product you will receive is a similar malfunctioning cable that is not branded by alpine in any way. It comes in packaging from china with no name on it whatsoever. I went out to a car audio store that was going out of business and luckily i found the real cable for $9.00 and it works perfectly. Thanks for ripping me off discount jungle.
2,only works half the time,"When it actually connects it works great, but half the time it just says ""searching"", and wont play. Other times it just freezes up completly."
3,it gets the job done,"this cable is much slower then the other usb cable for alpine. also it does not charge iphones, only ipods. also every time you turn off your car you have to start from the beginning of your music selection process, which is a pain. the other cable will remember where you were at in your menu and what you were listening too. the cable does work though and if these things dont bother you then its a cheaper alternative to the USB 2 cable"
4,Discover Denmarks leading soprano!,"Inga Nielsen is one of the finest sopranos in Denmark - or the world, even! Her voice is superbly beautiful, though not without a touch of drama. She is a ""singing actress"", exactly what is called for in ""Salome"". I wouldn't hesitate to compare her with Cheryl Studer on DG, though I still find Behrens (with Karajan on EMI) to be the most convincing portrait of the depraved princess. The other members of the cast are very satisfying: Perhaps Goldberg and Silja sing too beautifully - compared to Sinopoli on DG they don't convey the same image of depravity and insanity. The smaller roles are well cast, mainly with distinguished members of the Royal Danish Opera."
4,Tesh is great.,"Just what you want if sitting around after dinner , watching the Christmas tree lights. Christmas mood music, first class."
5,Great holiday mood setter!,"Let's face it, everyone gets tired of listening to ""Jingle Bell Rock"" and ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" for the umpteenth time, that's why this CD is so great. Lovely, low-key holiday music that you can play any place, any time to put you in that Christmas mood. I play this CD along with John Tesh's ""A Romantic Christmas"" at work, my clients love it. I've played it at my booth at Holiday fairs, again folks always comment on it. As for entertaining at home - it's perfect, non-obtrusive, back-ground holiday music. It makes for a festive mood without detracting from your party or family dinner. As for driving in holiday traffic - once again listening to these smooth tunes is always best. Like I said, this is a great holiday mood setter and money well spent. You will play this CD over and over for years to come. Be sure to get ""A Romantic Christmas"" too, set your CD player on shuffle and enjoy!"
1,High Court Case Summaries on Civil Procedure (High Court Case Summaries),"I am very disappointed. I was sent the wrong book and eventhough I contacted the seller and was able to get a refund, I was not reimbursed for the $8.50 shipping that it cost me to send it back."
5,Great Book. If you read it you will understand why...,Strong recommendations from others brought me to this book and I feel obliged to give back.This is a masterpiece.Well researched and well writtenI Got a hold of a couple of concepts missed in other books because of the lucidity of the examples and explanations.Great book If you read it you will understand why....Michael Tubuo Ngong
5,"Bisso na Bisso, the new African Hip Hop",Rapper Passi has done it. This Paris based African musicin has been able to fuse traditional African music that we are accustomed to such as the Zairean lingala music and combined it with the new Hip Hop beat to produce some very club danceable tunes. I would highly recommend this one.
3,Kung Fu Fichter,"No big names that I know of where in this dvd, but it was very entertaining to watch. The ending left you up in the air so maybe there will be a sequel."
1,Misleading title,"Where do I start? Poor character development.. Poor story.. Poor pacing.. This film was so poor I think roaches poured out of my PC whilst viewing.. Don't waste your time on this absolute dreck.. If you want to know the story *SPOILER ALERT* here goes.. Creepy stalker guy seeks frigid shut-in, must have father introduced in third act with nothing to go on and hope the audience forms it's own conclusion.. The end.."
3,Incomplete,"This was a chick flick (no guy would sit through this). The movie itself is incomplete. The ending creeps up on you and just leaves you hanging. Sure it kept my interest and I kept wondering WTH the main character hadn't just left the psycho chick yet (obviously he's a leech in it for the shelter). Had they flipped the movie and taken the ending portion of the story and stuck it in the middle of the movie it would have made more sense and been the climax point, then tack on the usual sappy love story romance toward the end after she turns around. The cover to this Amazon Instant video is very deceiving, no idea where this image came from but it was nowhere in the movie (the male character touching the female character in this loving glance is nowhere to be found anywhere!). The female character is more like a rabbid dog waiting to attack if he were to touch her like this as portrayed on the cover."
2,Lame,"The characters in this movie really aren't very likable, and the male lead comes across as creepy more than anything else. It tries to be clever and edgey, and the whole thing just falls flat.The direction, writing, and acting are all pretty horrible."
2,We gave it an honest try,"We ejected this movie after 30 minutes when we first tried to watch it.Then we saw the mostly favorable reviews here on AMAZON.comSo we tried to watch it again.We lasted until about 60 minutes the second time trying to watch it and finally gave up.I think my wife's exact words were ... ""OK, enough already. You have to put something else in to watch. This is stupid and I don't care what happens to these losers""."
2,not much going on here,"This looked interesting so I took a chance on Jason and Marianna. It's characters are quirky, I'll give it that, but there just is not alot going on. Maybe I wanted to get further along in the relationship, or lack thereof. Maybe I just wanted to see something like the cover implied. Maybe I just couldn't relate to the characters, but it just didn't move me. The lameness of chasing this woman seems obvious.Anyway, I may just be biased as I paid the full 20 bucks for the movie. It's morelike a 5 dollar discount bin movie. Or a two dollar weekday rental to relieveboredom.I'm sure Ritter and Plaka got a nice dinner out of my expense. But I think I'd like my money and time back."
1,I'll never get the last hour and a half of my life back...,This movie was just bad. You dont need much more of a review past that.
4,Unexpected,"This was a very interesting film and by far nothing like the box-office romantic comedies I'm used to seeing. The first 30 minutes or so I was pretty put off but stuck through it and soon found myself so intrigued with the characters and why they act/react as they do. This film subtly address several deeper issues which was very unexpected based on the title, but it fits. The male lead is such a strong, yet vulnerable character- makes you really wish there were more guys like him in the world. She comes across very harsh & abrasive, but there is a method to her madness that only he can see until the end when her back story finally reveals itself. Both actors played these roles superbly."
4,The title puts you off.,"I started watching this movie thinking that I wouldn't finish it. But, there was something to the guy's character that said that he was more than just a stalker. If you can get past that, you will see that this is a true love story. It's about a really damaged person that needs love and a less than brilliant guy who fills that need.I hate to say it but when I saw Charles Durning in it I thought there must be more to the story than I am seeing and I hung in a little longer. Watch it to the end and you will understand."
2,not what I expected,"The title, cover image and description set the wrong tone for this film. I came across this on Netflix streaming and thought it would be a cute, funny indie movie going by all that. However, it's not cute and it's not funny. I have no idea why this says it's a comedy, and the romance aspect of it involves this guy basically stalking an extremely quiet and clearly disturbed woman, staring at her through open blinds while she watches her soft porn, lying to her to get her to allow him to sleep in her apartment, and then she treats him bizarrely and terribly for most of the rest of the movie while he insists upon trying to make her love him. Towards the end of the movie, the guy tells the girl he loves her, and all I could think was ""Why?"" I myself am a quiet introvert, and I like a lot of weird little indie movies, but this didn't resonate with me at all."
1,Waste of time,I really did not enjoy this movie. It WAS creepy and strange and really didn't make sense. The ending was horrible. The whole movie just annoyed me.
1,This movie was horrible,"Regrettable. A waste of 45 minutes (that's all I could take before I turned it off). A ridiculous premise and characters that no one will care about. If it wasn't free, I'd want my money back. : ("
1,Horrible film,Terrible film. no emotions. no narrative. the main female lead is disturbing and twisted. the film doesn't cumulate into a cohesive story.
2,Well it was a movie....,Both have problems. I hope no one goes to the extreme that he did to find a lover.There is no way I would date a mental case chick like she is. She really has issues. But so does he. From boarder line stalking to living in a car for over six months. Uh.... yeah...I'm not sure if this was a love film or a freak show. I doubt I could watch it again and I am super happy non of my relationships ended up like that! This is not something I'd want to see again.
2,I really wanted to like this...,"...but I found it really frustrating. And, the use of the porn element to try and give it some shock value was so contrived, it was offensive. Given her background, I found it completely implausible that she'd allow Ritter's character into her life in any way. Finally, there were so many better ways they could have found to put these two people together, and the manipulation to hide her background was equally clunky and overly manipulated. Some good bones were there, they just couldn't make the whole thing payoff. It's a shame."
4,Good Dick/ VERY different!,"I think that this movie is really great due to its unique plot/story/presentation. It reminds me of the movie ""Clerks"" and maybe some of ""Chasing Amy"", both of which I enjoyed, both which were unique in content and story. Seldom does a movie like this show up, and I congradulate the the writers for their writing and filming. Surprizes over and over! Really don't know what's going to happen next!"
5,Ignore the title and try it,"This movie was referred to me by a friend and in spite of the title I decided to try it. I am very happy that I did. It turned out to be a movie with great humor and a complete case study of the two main characters. The dialogue was outstanding, although the guy must have been a saint to put up with her. I am telling the rest my friends to ignore the title and to try it themselves."
2,Lousy story,Who writes this stuff? In todays world the guy would have been accused of being a stalker and the girl was completely psycho and yet he still put up with her. Not likely.
3,Good ending!,"A somewhat far fetched plot that keeps you interested in where the heck this is going feeling. If you are looking for something to watch, that doesnt need to be a five star movie, this is a decent choice."
3,big reel of confusion,"so this movie's description really isn't helpful at all. it DEFINITELY doesn't deserve to be in the ""comedy"" genre! i laughed for a total of about 12 seconds. and that was pretty much all at the same time.i was totally expecting some sort of romcom, so the movie fails here. HOWEVER, if the description & genre had been more accurate, i would say it's a great film. i think it was well-done, with lots of unexpected twists. as someone said before, though, it is not at all a hand-holding film. i live-tweeted the whole thing because i was confused the entire time! i storified my tweets here: [...] (warning: i cuss a lot)"
1,GOOD DICK THE FLOP,"this was of the wiredest,crazyest movi i ever saw i guess there are people messed up as bad as those people were but unless your a phychiatrist there's never a reason to write about it, there was certainly no reason to do a movie about it,yep hated it."
4,Stupid Title. Good Movie.,"If you can move past a title that I suppose is trying to be titillating and actually watch the film, you may be pleasantly surprised. There is actually a funny, touching, and meaningful film here."
5,Perches,Great perches. Especially for the larger birds like Macaws. Just be sure to get the wingnuts on really tight or the bird will play with it and unhook it. It's not a manufacturing defect. It's just because the birds are so smart and have such strong beaks! lol
3,"Sparkly, but dull colors and awkward size","I bought this ring after seeing the stellar reviews. After receiving it, I have to say I disagree with most of them. The colors of some of the stones are washed out to the point of being almost indistinguishable from each other. In addition, the ring is an awkward size. It's not a chunky cocktail ring, but it's not delicately pretty, either. I think most people with small fingers should avoid this ring. On the plus side, it is very sparkly and shiny, and it does look solidly made."
1,A word to the wise,"Some reviewers have suggested using malathion inside your home for bedbugs. Don't do it. Malathion is wickedly toxic stuff and if you don't know exactly what you're doing, you can seriously hurt yourself by spraying it around inside your house. Propoxur is far less toxic than malathion is and it's even more effective on bedbugs (Malathion has little residual effect and bedbugs have already begun to acquire some resistance to it; this is not true of propoxur.) If you have a stubborn bedbug infestation, you'd be much better off using propoxur. Check out my review ofINVADER HPX AEROSOLto learn more."
4,Kills bugs,"This malathion product is good at killing bugs, but note you need a sprayer to apply it. Read the directions to find the correct amount of product to spray."
3,"helpful, however, not for the beginners","A few names for some ingredients are mistranslated or misleading (e.g. 'Sesame Salt' does not mean a kind of salt but crushed sesame seeds) and the instructions are not detailed enough for a beginner to follow.Overall, this book is helpful just because Korean recipe books in English are rare."
2,NOT for beginners!,"I'm Korean, but have rarely ventured into the kitchen. I ordered this book and found it overwhelming. Even the instructions for basic dishes appear quite complicated and time consuming. There are few photos, and the photos that are in the book are quite small. One recipe calls for 2 pounds of ""beef"" but doesn't explain what kind. Another recipe calls for ""beef bones"" but what the heck does that mean? How does one make ""ginger juice"" or ""pear juice"" called for in various recipes? I got the impression this book is geared for a homemaker who already knows their way around a kitchen, and not for a busy working woman/man without much cooking experience."
3,"so so, a bit disappointed",I read the other reviews and thought this might be a good book but am disappointed.
1,Beware,"Beware! No matter what size you choose you will receive women's 6-7 then all of the paperwork will reflect this size. I ordered men's size 10 and I received women's 6-7, thinking that I had made a mistake in the ordering I reordered size 10 but at the end of the ordering process it stated women's 6-7, so unless you're vigilant and cancel the order you will receive this size. As far as the product, I bought my first pair from my podiatrist and they are absolutely great."
2,"Poor construction, medium performand, awful warranty","Although the drive have the pro that if you lose it your information is secure (that's why I bought it before I travel), this memory have a huge cons, that construction quality is poor I bought one in august 2007 and it just work well for just 17 months, I try to get the warranty but they ask for a payment and cause this is now a discontinued product I only will get a refurbish work. Come one, it's true that security is a matter, but good quality is another one important. It also have some issues working with Windows XP and Vista.I hope Kingston begins to make USB memories in America again, no more crap from China."
1,FLUSH AFTER VIEWING,"This movie boasts a drinking game that goes with it. It requires the players to take a shot when certain things are said or happen. It is rather a lame game done in hindsight. The movie has a great idea that was done rather poorly. Two former high school nerds, after a 12-pack decide to get even with everyone who picked on them in school. It starts out as a gag, but when they accidentally kill the first victim....The movie has some Iternet porno clips as well as a masturbation scene. For some reason they felt they had to show you the contents of the commode, another scene that may of made a young John Waters proud, but at my age, it is a waste.The movie is short (77 minutes) and the drinking game wasn't worth it. The acting was bad, perhaps by design. The campy nature of the movie didn't go far enough to make it a cult classic. Not worth the view unless you really are desperate for an excuse to drink."
3,Oldie but a goodie,"This book is old and getting out of date, but is is divided into workable sections, give good syntax information and the hand movement diagrams are very clear. I use it for teaching sign to deaf animals."
3,extremely average pop punk,"when i first heard this CD i thought it was just plain AWFUL! If i had reviewed it the second after i first heard it I would have given it a 1. But after listening to it more i came to realize that it's not that bad you just have to let it grow on you after a while. Now the actual band, the Gamits, have a lot of talent and I am sure they have a big future in front of them and eventually they will release a 5 star album. This is nothing more than an average debut album"
5,Other Reviewers are BIASED!,"I've read Gay Chicago and Sticky Remote and RAD Video and all of them have a biased slant of reviewers of guys who seem to only give reviews if people SLEEP with them. Don't trust them, go to someone who seems to have a reputation for fairness and objectivity. You can't just give your FRIENDS good reviews, like others do. That's why Mickey Skee has a book, and others have nothing, or just one version of their books.If you want it fair and funny, this is it.roland!"
2,Cute but VERY Fragile!!!,"I ordered this for my 3 yr old son who loves his cousin's musical box. There arent very many out there for boys! He was so happy when he opened it.....but within a few hours, we discovered that the actual music piece was not even secured to the box at all, and the little spinning doggie kept getting stuck on the platform. My little boy never even wound it up...only mommy and daddy. This box is very flimsy and there are pieces inside that look like they should be glued down, but arent. What a difference in the quality of the disney boxes as compared to this one! My husband is going to try to fix it....who knows! If I knew....I would never have spent this kind of money on it!"
3,"Really cute, but be careful with curious boys!","This is a great alternative for boys who, like my son, are fascinated by the ballerina in the box. But the box is made of paper and he very quickly (without abusing it) had some of the glued seams coming apart. The dog also scraped the mirror pretty bad because it didn't always stop right away when the box was closed. I wish there was something a little sturdier for boys, like the nice boxes made for girls. We'll keep looking, this box wasn't it for us..."
2,Could be Better,"I think that overall the book was ok. If you are just starting out, need a detailed plan, or have a large group this book may help you. If you have a small group or if you're trying to go deeper with your youth leaders then this book would be a better reference book then a ""game plan"". In short, it only skims the top of what leadership is. I feel it doesn't allow you to totally cultivate and tap-in-to the full leadership potential of your youth leaders."
3,"Good idea, poor execution...","I purchased this product because I wanted a slimish case with a hard shell to protect my important discs. Similar to the experience of the second reviewer, ""J.Alberty"", my case arrived with one side of the thin metallic veneer separated from the plastic shell and the other side partially so. A quick inspection of the inside revealed that the metallic veneer is only held to the plastic shell by double back tape. Instead of going through the hassle of returning this product I think I'll simply reattach the metallic veneer with a better quality adhesive since it seems likely that a replacement product will have the same shortcoming. This should be a wake up call to the manufacturer to use a better adhesive for the metallic veneer and step up on the QA. I'd be embarrassed to let my product out of the door like this when the fix would be so simple to do."
2,"""Pfaltzgraff"" is no different","I ordered these for a Christmas gift and had totally missed the stoneware description. Most of my family members hate stoneware for the reason of it being heavy. Upon first glance to these plates I immediately thought to myself, ""What will I do with them?!"" They are really too heavy for seniors with pain in their hands and too heavy to hang as decoration plates on your walls. I had also thought they were smaller in size. I had hoped to impress with the Pfaltzgraff name but stoneware has no practicality for me. I'm sure those familiar to Pfaltzgraff will think I am crazy to return these but I simply cannot find a use for them due to their weight. When you order online be sure to read ALL the details so you won't make the same mistake when purchasing gifts."
4,A Star Like Asimov,"Isaac Asimov is undoubtedly one of the brightest stars in the science fiction firmament, and much of his fame stems from the Foundation trilogy. The Stars, Like Dust is the first book of the Galactic Empire trilogy, which is set before the time of the Foundation. As such, it invites inevitable comparison to Asimov's earlier classics. Like the books of the Foundation trilogy, it is an entertaining and thoughtful mix of hard SF and space opera. While it cannot match the Foundation books in terms of sheer originality, TSLD is an enjoyable romp through the pre-Foundation galaxy, and offers the kind of tight plotting and solid scientific speculation (given that it was written in the 1950s) that fans of the Master have come to expect, with a surprise ending I won't forget."
4,Good space adventure,"The opening chapter is terrific; and the rest of the novel has enough twists and revelations that it kept me interested. Reading this, it's not hard to believe that Asimov is known for (among other things) practically inventing the science fiction detective novel. Though THIS book is not a whodunit, it has some of the same sort of cerebral appeal as a good mystery novel. It's not Asimov's best work, and it doesn't have the ""strange new worlds"" and exotic aliens that some people turn to science fiction for, but if you're in the mood for a good old-fashioned ""space opera,"" this is good entertainment."
2,Not at all like I remember,"I read this novel in my early teens, when I was devouring much of what is now called classic SF. Either I found it more exciting when I was a kid, or my memory is failing me. This time around I found The Stars Like Dust to be talky, boring, and confusing. There is almost no action."
4,The least of the Empire novels,"It is really an enormous tragedy that so many of Isaac Asimov's greatest Science Fiction works remain out of print. The three `Empire' novels by Asimov are a great example. All three books are wonderfully written and fill the gap between The Robot novels and the Foundation series beautifully. These novels are also a glimpse at the state of science in the fifties. If you are an Asimov fan and see any of the Empire novels available for loan or purchase please do so. You will not be sorry. To clear up some confusion on the part of another reviewer the reason these novels are called `Empire' novels is because they take place just before the Empire began, during its infancy and at its peak. Very much fun indeed."
2,He got much better,"One of Asimov's first novels, it blew me away, but I was twelve and that was 1959. The science content was dazzling for the time. I loved it then. Not so much now. I am not re-evaluating based on newer scientific discoveries, but on the quality of the story and writing. Asimov got much, much better, but in this book, the romance is pre high school, and the political intrigue is simple-minded. The story is predictable and the twists are telegraphed. An interesting hint to future sophistication in Asimov's ideas is the Tyrrani overlord, who is anything but a conventional villain.I recommend this to the twelve-year-old of today and suggest that as you work your way down Asimov's bibliography you will find treasures."
2,"sci-fi classic, but disappointing","I enjoy old, classic SF novels occasionally, but this Asimov novel about the search for the empire's rebellion world did disappoint me. The lead character, Biron, is believable only to a naive teenage reader (as I was 40 years ago). The romance is even less believable. The plot was more interesting than the characters, with some interesting twists. The ending was hokey, though I did like it. This is not Asimov at his best, but there were still parts I enjoyed."
3,"It is a good book, considering it's from 1951.","Asimov himself was dissatisfied with this because of a subplot the editor made him tack on the end, but I still found it overall amusing and entertaining. This is supposed to be an Empire novel, but there is no mention of anything like an Empire arising or even the hint of it, so I don't understand that part, but it is still enjoyable. Asimov did well, being a young writer when he wrote this."
1,RIDICULOUS PRICE!,"WTF! This book is 59 years old! The Author, who is a master, has been dead for 18 years. The book cost about $2.50 to make and they are selling it for $9.99. How come Macmillan/Tor don't get it? Even Spectra understands because they sell the Foundation books for $5.99. This is pure price gouging by the publishers in my opinion"
4,"Wish I could have read it, but VERY enjoyable","This is the first of what will most likely be a LONG line of audio books I will check out from the library to listen to during the long commutes to and from work.But that's not your concern ...Material: 4.25/5 starsAdaptation: 3.75/5 starsI really like Isaac Asimov's writing ... save for one aspect; romance. I just never thought he got the hang of it. (Unlike Arthur C. Clarke, Asimov at least tries.) That's most of the .75 of a star I took off. This is a fairly fast-paced adventure despite the long monologues (which are never boring). Part of me wishes I had had the time to actually read it (rather than listen to it).Which comes to the ""Adaptation"" rating. It's good, no question. But after a while a few of the narrator's characterizations got tiresome.Overall, a very good ""read""."
4,"Galloping galaxies, another fine Asimov read...","While I would not consider this a 'must read' like many of his other books, this short book still makes for a fun adventure. I believe this is book 2 in the Empire trilogy, but from what I understand, reading this one first really won't make a huge difference. It hasn't for me yet. Weak points include a lame romance, with the only girl in the whole story, who just happens to be hot. This circumstance is very convenient for Biron - the handsome, fearless, and brilliant hero of the story. Kind of reminds me of another cheesy romance in a more recent popular film about an evil empire. I really don't think you can go wrong with Asimov, and being born in the US, I left with a better perspective of an immigrant's respect for the some of the ideals of the country's founders."
1,THIS GAME STINKS,I can't belive you people can like this game... Take my advice and don't buy this game.
1,Hate it! Don't buy this for a boy.,"The deflector comes down and pinches, when my son sits on it. You have to hold the deflector up so it doesn't come down on his privates. He has already figured how to turn the music on by moving around on the chair. Not worth the money."
4,nice training aid,"This is a cute chair, it must be comfortable, because my grandson will sit on it for quite a while. Its versatile, can go on the real toilet and be used as a step stool. (my grandson likes to stand on it to peek out the window). It plays tunes when peed in, although as the baby soon figured out, if you bounce up and down hard enough, it will play, diluting the reward feature. I am happy with it. The only other disadvantage of this potty is that the seat area is a little small, and you have to be careful that boys don't scrape their weenies when sitting or getting up from this chair."
2,Music doesn't stop!,"I bought this potty for my daughter - I purchased it because it is a potty, a stepstool, has the removalbe seat for the toilet, and I thought the music would be cute. You are not able to turn off the music and it goes off ALL THE TIME! We wake up in the middle of the night to it going off and have to take it apart just to get it to stop! I strongly suggest looking at a different potty."
1,Bowl doesn't catch the pee at all,"We actually borrowed this potty from my sister, who never takes the time to write reviews, LOL--- and when I asked her about it, she said they always had the same problem. We have a little girl, so no issues with the ""pee guard"", but there is ALWAYS a puddle under the chair! Luckily, ours sits on a laminate floor and is easy to clean up, but I can't imagine trusting it on carpet! I can't figure it out, either--my husband and I have both watched her pee, and it makes no logical sense why there is often more pee on the floor than in the bowl---we've adjusted the bowl constantly, and nothing seems to help. My sister gave it to us w/o batteries--she said the music was such a pain to not even bother with it, so we can't speak to that aspect. We plan to splurge on a Baby Bjorn soon, or something similar and simple that will catch everything."
1,"Hate it, not ideal for baby boy.","My son is 23 months, he hates this potty as well as I do. It pinches his private part. The little cup in the front that is supposed to act as a barrier when they pee is too close. I tried tucking it in there but it hurts him. Buying a new potty seat this one isn't worth it and he hates it and says no when I want to sit him in it."
1,What a waste!,"The music goes off all the time...often waking us up in the middle of the night. Sometimes it's just 1 royal tune and sometimes it goes on playing tune after tune for who knows how long. And like another reviewer said...you can't turn it off, you just have to take the thing apart. This also makes it really ineffective as a reward for the child b/c it will play music for my daughter without her doing anything in it. So, she's getting rewarded for sitting there and not forming the reward association with doing something in the potty. She's also fearful of the big toilet, so taking the removable seat off and using the base as a step stool right now is not an option."
5,My son loves to go potty with this potty!,This is a great potty.I been potty training my son he loves wen the potty rewards him for going pee pee or pop po great step stool to raise my son to the sink to warsh his hands he also brushes his teeth. great potty well made many great features can be used as a potty seat on a adult potty.easy cleaning has a removle sound maker takes 3 aa battries note remove wen clean potty step stool can handle 150 pounds so adults can stand to reach tooi am glad to buy this well spent moneyglad fisher price makes these pottys.
2,better step stool than potty,the back of the chair comes forward easily. the pee gaurd is easily removed. sometimes the music would go on in the middle of the night like the batteries were going dead. my kids would flip it over to push button to hear the music.the stool works great now for brushing teeth but we choose a different potty chair.
5,Jacob's Magic Box - 5 pack,These are all great books for pre-schoolers. We own the complete series and my 2 year-old loves them all and we spend a lot of time reading them each week. Jacob is a really cute little boy and his grandma always has something interesting and fun to show him in the magic box. Wonderful series.
5,loretta lynn the definitive collection,If you like Loretta Lynn you will love this CD. The Audio is very good.
1,The Definitive collection =Loretta Lynn,Did not care for the songs. All songs were about cheating on husband or wife and very depessing. Would not reccommend this to any one.
4,MCA does Loretta right...,"I have just finished listening to this collection, and it's a very enjoyable compilation, particularly if you put some of the songs in the context of when they were recorded. I have never been a die-hard Loretta Lynn fan, and only became aware of her when the film ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" was released back in 1980. But this offering is gorgeously packaged, with nice liner notes and chart positions for every track. My personal favorites are ""Woman of the World (Leave My World Alone),"" ""One's On The Way,"" ""You Ain't Woman Enough (To Take My Man),"" and the Conway Twitty duets ""As Soon As I Hang Up the Phone"" and ""Louisiana Woman, Mississippi Man."" 25 tracks in all. Now if MCA would just re-release her 80's album, ""Just A Woman"" on CD!"
1,Hated it,"From the china-doll haircut of the girl on the cover, to the typical white-boy & Asian-girl relationship, the book reeked of colonialism. From the way that Cambodian values are cast as ""traditional"" and ""conflicting"" with ""ordinary American life,"" to the way that her love for a white man is seen as becoming ""more American,"" it is obvious that this is another text in the tradition of the Joy Luck Club: exoticize and degrade Asian cultures, all Asian women should be with white men. As an Asian American, I found it degrading and offensive. White people will probably eat it up. I read it while standing up in the bookstore and didn't bother to buy it."
5,Children Of The River,"I like Children of the River because it shows self-respect. Childern of the River is really a thrill. I like it because you get to learn alot of new things,things about a different country.I also like it because it is something I can enjoy and read all day. Reading a book like that seems like to me that I am moving up a level every time I read a book like that. Thats why I think Children of the River is a very good book."
3,a teacher's review,"On a personal level, I did enjoy reading this book and it actually moved me to tears. However as a teacher, I found it to be more of a love story than good historical fiction. Although I have not found something better, I would not want to use this book as historical fiction to learn more about Cambodia and the Vietnam War. I also don't want to reinforce the author's message about the main character disobeying her family's wishes throughout the entire book and basically deciding in the end that she needs to follow her heart regardless of her family's wishes. Although in some situations, I would agree with that theme, I do not necessarily want to endorse it when it comes to a teenager listening to family members who care about her."
5,From a 9th grade high school student's point of view,"I had never heard of Children of the River until I was assigned to read it in English class. Once I started to read it, it was impossible for me to put it down. It made me realize that anything could happen to anyone and that you shouldn't seem as if when you are with your parents and other family or friends, you are bored and want to be somewhere else; one day you might not have that option to see them. I have learned a great deal from 15-year-old Sundara and I know that anyone else who reads this amazing book by Linda Crew will feel the same."
4,i liked it,"I enjoyed this book very much. It was very gripping and hard to put down. It draws you in and you feel like you are really there. You feel for the characters during the hard times, and it makes you happy when things get better. I liked that the author did a lot of research on the topic because that made the book very accurate, right down to the way the characters speak. I learned a few things about that part of the world. It also teaches some very good lessons about life and how to put things in perspective. The only thing I didn't like as much about this book was the ending. It kind of leaves you hanging, wondering about what might happen. Some people like that though. I cant really think of any other books that this is similar too, I don't think I have read any like it before. Despite the fact I didn't really like the ending, this was still a wonderful book. I honestly couldn't put it down."
4,"Very Good, but one Complaint","I loved this book so much, next to Walk Two Moons by Sharon Creech, and the sequel to it, Chasing Redbird, Children of the River was my favorite book. I had to read it for school and usually I hate to be forced to read. I hate having a deadline, but I just could not put this book Down!!! I got burried so deep into it, I felt like I was there! I felt for the characters. The only complaint I had was that I wish that the author had given me a better ending! She left me hanging! I wanted to know more about what happened to her parents and sisters and brothers! I was left unfufilled and curious, and I was disappointed. In all other aspects though, I loved it!!!"
4,This book is a MUST for all!,This book is a great one for cozely sitting near a fire on a cold night! A must read!!
2,Children Of The River,"Jasmine2/28/07Review: Children of The River""Children of the River"", in my opinion, was not a very good book. At first it got my attention because the summery on the back cover, worded it, as a adventurous survival story. A story of a 13 year old Native American who flew off to Cambodia to escape the Khmer Ruge Army, and left her family behind, in search of a new life. And yes that did happen in this book, but the story was stretched out, long, and boring. I would not recommend this book to anyone, unless they have some time to waist. On a scale from one to five i would rate this book a two. Only because it may help some people with an idea of Native American history."
4,Children of the River,"Children of the River turned out to be a good book. Going into the book I thought it was going to be boring, and another book about people coming to America. I liked how there were some conflicts in the book between Sundra and Soka. I liked how Sundra went behind Soka's back to be with Jonathan even thought she wasn't allowed to be with an American boy much less any boy. I also liked how the author told about all of the harsh conditions they were living under on the boat. I didn't like the parts when Sandra saw the arm at the dump because it was kind of weird how a baby was just lying in a dump. Sundra really developed as a teenager, from learning how to cope with not having her parents around and having to leave her country to living in America under hard religion restrictions. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading about a teenagers problems and emotions."
4,Justice,"All of the characters have a defined personality. You know where they came from, what they feel and can get a sense of why they act the way they do. I think it's a wonderful idea to write a preface just to describe the characters. Now in the book he can get right to the point of the story."
4,Really great little book and easy to use,"Have enjoyed all of the muffins recipes that I have tried. This is a great little book, only problem is that some of the flours (graham flour) was very hard to find, thank God for King Arthur flour company. I recommend this book to all who like myself love muffins."
1,Bad,"Save your money, this game is bad. Even my 5 year old said she didn't like it. Some parts were too hard, some parts were stupidly easy/boring. Mr. Bubbles voice over gets really really old. He talks so slow and deep and you gotta sit though it to figure out what to do next. Honestly, I would be embarassed if my name was on this box."
1,Not Enjoyable!,I purchased this game and was very disappointed. I can usually count on Disney for quality but either the games are too hard or to simple. My kids own almost every Disney game for the computer and this one has to be one of the worst. We loved the movie but the game just isn't worth the money.
1,Stupedest Game in the World!!!,Do not waste your money on this horrible game!!! There's no reward and you have a really hard time quitting the game once it's started. Do not buy this game!!!
4,Short story collection,"I believe it takes a special talent to be able to produce a good short story, particularly these days when there are not many publishing outlets for them. This collection then, is especially welcome since it brings together short stories from many famous authors. Like any collection, however, it contains stories that are good, and stories that are bad, and some that are a little of both. It's to the credit of the editor that he has produced this work, and I recommend it to those who enjoy reading shorter works from some of their favorite authors. Despite some of the shortcomings of this collection, I am looking forward to the next edition of this work, if only for the continuation of the last story in the collection."
4,Nice Collection,"As a subscriber to Mcsweeneys, I was thrilled to get this edition in the mail. Most of the stories are quick and fun reads. Some were a bit too bizarre, but for the most part this collection of stories is good. The issue also has old time ads throughout, adding to the pulpy feel of the stories in the magazine."
4,Fun riffs that reinvigorate the short story format,"This is an excellent collection of genre pieces. As with any collection, there are clunkers that are not short enough but this group of writers are having fun which translates to the page. I especially enjoyed the Nick Hornby's offering which may have a formulaic plot but the tone and words are pitch perfect. It was just like a teenager. Neil Gaiman's offering was too short. I wanted more. And don't forget Squonk."
2,generally dreadful,"The premise of this anthology was terrific-- round up a bunch of first rate (mostly ""literary"") writers and have them do stories that are unpretentious, unaffected, rip roaring good reads. Just look at the cover illustration and you know what I mean. But the more the literary the writers here, the more it's plain that most of them saw the project as a kind of fun-slumming and as a result, their work wreaks of condescension and self-parody. The only good stories here are written by the likes of Neil Gaiman, Michael Moorcock and Kelly Link. Genre writers all, but nevertheless heads and tails better than the likes of Rick Moody, Dave Eggers, Jim Shepard, Chabon, etcetera. If you want to read a knockout anthology that wonderfully achieves everything this antho doesn't, check out ""CONJUNCTIONS:39-- The New Wave Fabulists"" The contrast between the two collections is profound."
2,Thrilling? Not really.,"I was more than a little disappointed with this anthology. I was hoping for a modern take on the thrilling pulp yarns of yesterday and instead many of the authors went for stories without any real tie to the idea of being ""thrilling."" Instead there are thoughtful tales of fantasy, good and unreadable SF and just a few examples of the genre that I thought this book was shooting for. Elmore Leonard comes through with his tale of Carlos Webster,Michael Crichton does a nice job with a little story about a man with ""mother"" problems, and David Eggers does a nice take on a Hemmingway style mountain climbing adventure. Don't get me wrong there are good stories here, but the overall feel is not consistent with the title. Just too many tales of time travel and soul searching in a collection of ""thrilling tales"" for this reader."
3,A noble effort,"Probably the best piece of writing in the book is Chabon's introduction in which he bemoan's the ""quotidian epiphantic"" short story as the ONLY type of short story to be given serious consideration. What about plot-driven stories? Despite what many critics would have us believe, it is the plot-driven story that sticks in our mind. The spirit of the book is to gather some of today's best authors and have them give the old plot-driven story a go. The results are hit and miss. I greatly enjoyed ""Megalodon"" and ""Tears of Squonk"" as well as the offerings of Nick Hornby and Elmore Leonard. Surprisingly, the masters of the plot driven stories - Stephen King and Harlan Ellison - offer lesser efforts (in Ellison's case, he merely reprints an old story instead of writing a new one)."
2,A Snooze,"After reading this book of ""thrilling"" tales, I'd hate to read a book of boring ones. This work is uneven throughout and dull in many places. Very few stories stand out."
2,Random house corporate price fixing rip-off,"This is one of those price fixing scandal books. I won't buy it asa long as that is the case. Put this on your ""wish list"" and wait for a fair price.Don't patronize corporate rip-offs.."
2,Disappointment,"I picked up this book mainly because of Michael Chabon and I wanted to read some short stories for a while. I read maybe 5 of the stories before I put it down. I was quite disappointed with the ones I read, and didn't want to waste time by reading further. Squonk was the best of the ones I read, but the others didn't hold my interest very long. I'd suggest choosing another short story collection."
1,Not a good one in the bunch,"Neil Gaiman's ""Closing Time"" was the only story that came close to being good."
2,"spotty, uneven, just not all that great","The other reviewers have summed it up: I wanted to like this collection, but it let me down. If you must read it, get it from the library -- it is not a keeper."
2,motley collection,"The authors themselves may be on lots of ""Best Authors Writing Today"" lists, but most of these stories sound like assignments rather than works of some sort of inspiration (however unexalted that inspiration might be). The collection is the short-story equivalent of a set of academic essays in honor of a retiring scholar. In other words, although the subjects may interest the authors, it seems as though some of them wrote the stories because they were asked to and because they didn't mind having them in a collection with a bunch of other ""assigned"" work. If you finish books that you bought (even if you don't like them) because not finishing them is a waste of money, don't buy this book, get it out of your library instead. That way you can skip the stories that are really tedious (for instance, The Albertine Notes, which was really a poor rendering of a post-apocalyptic Manhattan with some trippy mind/time travel thrown in) with a clear conscience."
3,Squandered Opportunities,"For all the talk of foregoing tales of modern minimalism for something more thrilling, I found it sad how many of the contributors decided to do retro-pulp pastiches, borrowing ironically from the settings of pulp-in-its-heyday, rather than take on the more interesting challenge of finding thrills to equal those of the old pulps in completely new and modern settings. There's very little new ground broken here, for that reason, and this comes off largely as a collection of stories told in a fakey antique mode."
4,Worth reading,"I bought this anthology because I love Chabons work and it included other notable authors I enjoy. As should be expected not all the stories are great, some are just terrible.Glen David Gold, Michael Moorcock, Dan Chaon, Michael Crichton, I really enjoyed.Kelly Link, Chris Offut, Harlan Ellison, I really didnt like.Others fell in between.All in all I say its worth a read. The authors showcase their particular styles and there are more good stories than bad. If not all together ""thrilling"" (though some are) there is a lot of good writing here.I would certainly recommend this for readers looking to sample genres and authors and explore venues to pursue in the future."
4,Typical excellence,"If you are looking for a disc with first-rate interpretations of some of the standards in brass band literature, this recording (and its somewhat more refined Volume 1) begs your attention. All of the performances are extremely clean and precise, and the technical requirements of these works are often extensive. There are the moments of overly sentimental playing and wobbly vibrato that was so off-putting to Vaughan Williams in his Henry V, but nothing outside of the standard practice in most British Brass Bands."
4,good flick,This movie takes me back.When i ordered this movie i thought that it wouldn't be as good as it was when i first saw it long ago.I have to say i really enjoyed it and i think the acting is better than some of the more current movies.This movie made me think that this type of stuff really happens.
5,Ultimate western,"I love this book. The dialog is particularly sharp, especially in scenes with Gus McCrae. Its got a ton of characters, and shares a mentality with J.R. Martin, no one is sacred, there is a lot of death and loss in this book. The sly wit and love-of-life Gus has is a great constrast to the all-work-no-play Call. There are many sad stories but also some uplifting tales. For all the suffering of the womenfolk, there are some strong scenes with the resourceful Janey, the domineering, feisty Clara. This showacases the durability and survival instincts of both genders."
4,"Very, very good book!","I wish I could give this book a 4.5 because I feel it deserves better than a 4, but it's not quite a 5. I really enjoyed reading this book. It is extremely well written and the character development is wonderful. I've never seen the Lonesome Dove miniseries, but it seemed like the main characters were written with Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones in mind.I read a lot of long books and I almost always come away feeling they are at least a couple hundred pages too long. Not Lonesome Dove. There are a few subplots in the book that take a tad too long to play out, but I don't think I would reduce this book by more than a few pages. The only thing that became mildly irritating for me as I progressed through the book was the overused stereotype of the ""ornery cowboy"" who is extremely independent and who has a catchy comeback for every statement. Did all cowboys really talk that way??Overall, a great book that is well worth the time it takes to read it."
2,Not Actually a Very Good Book,"I'd never read a Western before, so I figured I would start with the wildly praised Lonesome Dove. Oops.Though it purports to be an ""epic,"" Lonesome Dove's vision of the American West only contains about 20 people. They bump into each other again and again in the supposedly vast and empty plains. As an example, every character in the book who doesn't die beforehand wanders into the home of Gus's childhood sweetheart! All roads lead to a remote farmhouse in Ogallala.The action in the book primarily consists of characters being dicks to everyone around them, then getting mawkish when someone dies.However, you do learn the word remuda, which I enjoyed."
5,As Great as Everyone Says,"What can I add to a 297-average 5-star review? A resounding 298th! Friends of mine have been urging me to read Lonesome Dove for the last couple of years. I finally caved in. Though I enjoyed the occasional John Wayne movie, as a kid, and love traveling around the west, the ""western"" as a literary genre has never appealed to me. I approached LD with some misgivings, anticipating cliche characters, and a hackneyed plot. 800+ pages and many pleasurable hours later, misgivings totally upended, I am the latest in a long long line of McMurtry converts. What a gripping story. What fantastic characters. This is one of the most compelling novels I've ever read, and one of the most satisfying -- from start to finish. I would otherwise regret having reached the end of LD had McMurtry not weaved LD's characters back in time, and forward, through another 3 volumes. I can only hope he did them as much justice elsewhere as he did them in LD. LD is, in a word, first-rate!"
5,It's not just a Western or Romance novel,"Not a fan of western movies novels.Not a fan of reading a long romance novel.This is both of those things and so much more. My friend recommended it to me and I did not think I was going to get any pleasure.This is now one of my favorite novels ever and when I first read it I couldn't put it down.I didn't want to sleep. I just wanted to reach the end even though I dreaded the end.I love everything about it--the plot, the characters, the ending."
5,Outstanding,A wonderful western thriller. This book caught your attention and keep it through out the whole book.This western based story was about two famous Texas Rangers and there life. It started out in the town of Lonesome Dove. The law men Call and Gus deciede to take a herd of cattle to Montana and see the last unsettled land in the United States.This book is action packed and has many very good points. If you start it it will be one of the best books you have read. I know it was for me
4,Lonsom Dove,The book was great and well written. It was definitly the longest book have ever read in my life but I thoroughly enjoyed it. The ending seemed a little week to me. But I guess that I will have to read the next book to get the understanding why you ended Lonsom Dove the way you did. All in All I enjoyed the book.
2,Longwinded Lonesome Dove Lacks Story,"This book takes more than 100 pages to begin - that's where I gave up. McMurtry spends excessive effort in character building, to the exclusion of plot development, yet the characters still seemed rather two dimensional.A long western, winner of the prestigious Pulitzer prize, this book gave false hope of a several days' immersion in good read. Quite a disappointment."
2,Life In (But Mostly Out of) Lonesome Dove,"As would be expected with an 800+ page book, this is a novel about much more than a little town in Texas. The story and characters were much more enjoyable than I expected, but admit that I was a little surprised to find that the story was much more about the sprawling 19th century West than a character study of a small ranching town. And while that might have caught me off guard, I was also pleased with it. The characters and stories diverged and intersected in soap operatic fashion, but McMurtry tied it all back to the excitement and loneliness of the pre-settled West.That said, however, I would be remiss to not point out a major flaw. While there were passing allusions to the plight of Native Americans, the novel too often falls into the ""American hero/wild Indian"" trap. This is an unfortunate and unnecessary choice by the author, and it only serves to sully McMurtry's otherwise beautiful writing."
1,I tried reading Lonesome Dove,"I tried reading this book after reading a much shorter and wiser novel called Austin Nights by some dude who goes by herocious. Although herocious talks about Larry McMurtry a lot in Austin Nights, Lonesome Dove isn't championed. About halfway through Lonesome Dove, I had to put it down and move on to McMurtry's non-fiction, which is so much better, in my opinion."
1,Worst Book I Have Ever Read,"What happened to the spare, perceptive author of ""The Last Picture Show""? McMurtry spends nearly 200 pages introducing the characters, then sends us on an adventure with Gus and Call, two faceless, interchangeable Marlboro Men who shoot or hang everyone they meet. The prose is so cliched, the narrative so loose, the characters so murky, that I wonder if McMurtry was just typing. He was one of the most promising young novelists of the '60s, and he ended up writing this hack Western potboiler. A waste of a wonderful talent."
1,How can anyone like this book?,"I am a student of the American West with advanced degrees in History and Anthropology. I am also a prolific reader. I'm sorry, but this book is just..welll, awful!Historically the book is off at almost every turn, and the author has a liking for ""Magical Realism"". Not familiar? Okay. A character might have a huge chin, nose, voice, etc. or rats might fall inexplicably from the ceiling. Or a man might blow away like a tumbleweed. This sort of device is currently used in modern lit to qualify the piece as literature. Personally, I dislike it. I also dislike historical novelists who refuse to do their homework.Don't buy this expecting another ""Little Big Man"", or ""True Grit"". This novel bears a far greater similarity to Doctorow. This is not a true historical novel. Be forewarned."
5,One of the Greatest American Novels of the Late 20th Century,"After reading the entertaining books Mr. McMurtry had written before and after Lonesome Dove, I was stunned by the masterpiece he had created. This was an epic poem, leading toward the Holy Grail of Montana. He deserved the Pulitzer and I would venture to say he deserves a Nobel Prize for this alone. If you like the literary writing of early 20th century masters, you will enjoy this truly literate epic novel."
5,Best western ever!!!,Epic novel. One of the best reads ever. This is not a feel good western. Very true to life regarding the hardships experienced as this country expanded west. WONDERFUL BOOK!!! GET IT!!!!
5,Rudy,Enjoying the story greatly. The many characters are well - developed and interesting. Consistent with my understanding of the wild west.
