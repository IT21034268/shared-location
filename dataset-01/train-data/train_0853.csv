2,What's the point?,"Maybe I'm not imaginative, but most of the things this book offers are decorative items, not functional items. And they're not particularly attractive or interesting decorative items. A knitted pint glass? What FOR? I don't mind the occasional tchotchky, but these items are both silly and useless, as far as I'm concerned. There are two exceptions, a cute nightgown designed in the style of a twenties flapper dress, and a pair of ear muffs made of knitted fried eggs. If you like this kind of thing, and I don't know anyone who does, or if you like to knit and want to punish everyone you know with presents they'll hate, this is the book for you. Otherwise, stay far, far away."
3,I got my book....,"I received my order and was initially surprised and then a little let down. My order came in one day earlier than the estimate given by amazon. That was great. When I opened the envelope I was a little shocked. I thought that I had ordered a hardcover edition and I received a paperback. I'm glad to have my book, but I would have much rather have a later arriving hardcover than a promptly delivered paperback."
3,"Simply ""My opinon""","Well the reason for the purchase is due to the self intitled track ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida"". I can not recall all the way as to where I heard the song but I believe it was from a movie that I watched a while back. Anyhow resently the song just popped into my head and I said too my self ""I gotta see into who does that song"". So I asked my cousin if he knew and ""Ba da Boom, Ba da Bing"" he did and I bought the cd from Amazon.com. Also Amazon.com ""Will be my #1 source"" for those ""Old Time & Hard to Find Items"" and that's no lie! P.S. Enjoy your online shopping expierance at Amazon.com."
4,This Kicks Butt,"My favorit song is In-a-godda-da-vida because it kicks butt. This cd is grate for kicking back and ""relaking"" if you know whatI mean. ooooooooooooo ya."
5,Great service,Product came earlier than anticipated and in great condition. I couldn't be happier with my purchase.
3,One Looong Jam,"Okay so I suppose that nothing more really needs to be said about this little chestnut however I can't help myself. For starters this is a one song album--the first 5 songs are garbage and amongst the worst of anything released of that era. The idea of mixing iron and butterlfies is silly anyhow for proof listen to all these songs ""Are You Happy?"" c'mon...Okay, onto the important stuff, the title track is infectious like a cancer--no matter how many times you listen to it it spreads in your head and buries itself into your psyche and I'll be the first to admit that it is COOOOOL. It's a jam, nothing more nothing less and it plods along endlessly until the band has run out of ideas or drugs. If only the first 5 tracks were as good as this this record would have ranked up there with the most memorable of the psychedelic years hwoever it has been reduced to a novelty at best. Actually a 3 1/2......"
2,the source,the source of all the pretentious mindless soloing/jamming/bands on auto-pilot.A period piece that continues to haunt us. OK now I gotta go irritate some Doors fans...
3,In-A-Gada-Da-Vida CD,"Arrived a little late, most likely due to shipper/shipping service, having hard time getting ""stereo"" mix right, still trying, but nice product for the price!"
4,Hippie Days,"Ok, I only bought this CD for the one song In-A Gadda Da Vida. If you did not grow up when this was released, you probably won't like it...unless you are into to some weird tripping thing. This is old school psychedelic music period."
3,One great song...not much else,"There's not much I can say about the title track that hasn't already been said. I memorized the lyrics when I was 5 years old. Then I rediscovered the song, much to my delight, when I was 21. It's one of the landmark songs in rock & roll history. The problem with this disc is the OTHER half. It consists of a few featherweight flower-child, school-boy love songs, that stand in sharp contrast to the powerful title song. Only ""My Mirage"" is worth listening to, and even it wears out pretty fast. I don't think a CD can earn five stars because of one song, even if that song consumes half the disc's playing time."
5,One of the Founders of Heavy Metal,"Iron Butterfly is one of the greatest forgotten bands. While there aren't a lot of songs on this album, and it only fills out a little over 36 minutes, it's well worth your money, even for the title track alone. The drumming is superb, the basslines are heavy, the guitar playing of 17-year-old Erik Braunn is excellent. The leader, church organist and lead singer, Doug Ingle really knows how to front the band. Each song is interesting and very enjoyable, especially the title track. And if you want a true landmark acid/hard rock album of the late 60s, this is your ticket to happiness."
1,Not what I expected,"It is obvious now, after listening to this album, why this group faded into obscurity so quickly. The title track is the only one worthy of a listen, as the rest are outdated hippy garbage. The title track contains an interesting and very creative main riff. However, to carry this basic riff for 17+ minutes is ridiculous. Several complaints: a) Main riff is good, but more suited to a 3 min. single, b) musicianship is not that great, c) Guitar solos are uninspired, simplistic, and quite annoying, d) Sound quality is poor, tinny, and annoying, e) drum solo is to simplistic, poorly recorded, and obviously didn't require much talent, and f) the lyrics, which are sparse, are repetitive, boring, and don't stimulate the imagination as psychelic music should. Overall, I consider this album to be quite poor, and even on acid, would'nt find it very interesting. Try some Pink Floyd if you want a good, honest to God, psychedelic trip. And throw this junk in the garbage. Thank you."
2,....hummmmm..in da gadda da ..BAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"MUCHO ORGANO AL FRENTE, MUCHO TUFO A PSICODELIA FORZADA....SOLO EL TEMA QUE DA TITULO AL ALBUM MERECE CONSIDERACION...ESO SI, LA EDICION ACTUAL ES MUY PROLIJA, CON BOOKLET, FOTOS Y ANECDOTAS...DESPUES NO HAY MUCHO PARA AGREGAR........."
2,What happened with the sound quality????,"What happened with the sound quality???? Read the other reviews of this CD (I Should Have). It sound's like a cassette tape rather than a engineered CD; With the ongoing ""Hissssssss"" in the background. This should have been a (do-over) at the studio..."
4,Blast From The Past,"I haven't heard the extended version of In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida in over 30 years and it brings me back to days of mind exploration. Along with bands like Yes,Led Zeplin, early Pink Floyd, ELP, and Vanilla Fudge, you could really let your mind go to far away places (with alittle bit of chemical help). The only complaint I have is that in an era of CD extra's, they did not include the radio version of the song. I don't know how many times you could listen to the extende version. It would be nice to have the single version release."
2,Not all it's craked up to be,"This was a huge album when it came out. But now, it really shows its age. Only two decent songs here. Save your $!"
5,"Have it on vinyl, but it's easier to load the CD onto my iPod","Both my husband and I have this album on vinyl, (and we even still have a turntable that works), but it is so much easier to load the CD onto my iPod than from the vinyl record. The music sure brings back memories!"
5,Classic song,If for no other reason to own this is for the song than remember the soundtrack of Man Hunter at the climatic shoot out.
4,More than just the timeless title track,"Iron Butterfly's second album, In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida, established the band with just one song, the hypnotic title track. You know the song. The one with that magical riff you never forget and the drum solo that goes on forever. And what a heavy song, so much so that when the mighty Slayer redid it on a soundtrack in the `80s (Less Than Zero), even they couldn't do it justice. There are other rewarding tracks here though. ""Most Anything You Want"" and ""Flowers and Beads"" are two psychedelic pop gems that should have been hit singles. ""Are You Happy?"" is a little heavier, more of a riff rocker actually while ""Termination"" and ""My Mirage"" are decent tracks, heavy on the organ and drums but not quite as memorable. All told, if you're a fan of this era, this is a must own. If you need proof that the band weren't just that one magnificent song, buy or download the album."
4,Only on CD,"You already know the album - all those songs you never cared to listen to on the one side, and the ultimate EP heavy rock classic on the other - the first record side you totally wore out in college. You can't get that on iTunes - all they offer is the short radio cut and the very lame, overly long live version. No, if you want this bit of psychedelic mayhem on your iPod, friends, you'll have to rip it like I did. But once you do it's all groovy from there!"
5,"Those good old Hippy Day,s !",I bought this for the long version of IN-A-Gadda-Da-Vida . I love it as it brings me back to my day in the 60's.
2,Psychedelic Classic Marred By Awful Transition to CD!,"This album was a seminal part of every teenager's album collection (including mine) in the 60's right along with the obligatory Hendrix and Cream albums. Granted, the remaining tracks couldn't compare to the title cut, but at 17 minutes plus, who the hell cared?That said, I would recommend that anyone considering buying ""In a Gadda Da Vida"" purchase a turntable and buy a used copy in vinyl at a record store. The sound quality of the CD is the worst of any album I've ever heard. The guitar solos in particular were mixed down way low and lose the ambience and sonic clarity of the record. The only thing stopping me from giving this CD a lower rating is the fact that at least someone had the guts to try and do it...and at least left the drum and organ solos in pretty good shape."
4,Memories,"Forget all the musical diagnostics! This is about where you were when you first heard this. Sure the title track is the only good one -- But it's Oh, So GREAT! If you remember nights of sitting on the bunker line (rewinding your tapes by hand so that you did't use up your precious batteries), then a couple trips through this classic will leave you feeling around you in the dark for that bandoleer of 5.56 Ball Ammo!"
2,Badly Scratched,"Purchased a used vinyl album on here listed as 'very good' condition. Record arrived. B-side is nearly pristine, sure, but side A was only slightly less scratched than a DMC bootleg. That is to say, the record was so badly scratched, placing the record on a gravel road and jumping on it repeatedy may actually improve the sound quality. So much for trusting the assigned record quality here."
3,One hit thunder,"Forever overshadowed by its title track, the early psychedelic metal was still able to pull off a somewhat respectable release despite some rough patches found in other songs."
5,In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida,"If you have never heard ""In A Gadda Da Vida, find a friend, relative, whoever and listen, then you will want to buy one of the great classics of rock music, In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida by the Iron Butterfly is a classic, highly recommended listening...............Mike D."
5,Iron Butterfly,A Classic from way back.Bought it for the original version of In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida.I was 11 yrs old and my older sister brought the LP home. Parents went berserk but it converted me from Country to Rock!
5,classic rock defined!,"The mother of all rock drum solos,no not the best,but it the first and is still a classic!"
5,if you haven't heard this...you missed something,Iron Butterfly's In A Gadda Da Vida is a rite of passage. How many groups must have heard this and decided to be rockers?
1,Can be a source of misleading information,"I agree with the other reviewers that this book is, by now, hopelessly out-dated.With such rapid progress made in tracing and understanding the illness, it is actually quite irresponsible of the authors and publisher to have published a book on SARS so prematurely. As far as I can see, some of the information here are only correct up to the first week of April 2003. All subsequent developments, which may have disproved earlier hypotheses contained in this book, have been ignored or are otherwise absent.Unless one can keep up with the latest developments through news reports, this book, instead of being informative, can be a source of misleading information.Despite the comparatively low retail price, I don't think this book is worth getting at all."
1,Almost useless,"This book is almost useful for me, as it throws practically no fresh insight on the latest findings on Sars. The contents are poorly produced and evidently put together in great haste. A one-star publication."
5,Simply inspirational,"This book was one of my first ""horse-related"" purchases as an adult and it will surely remain one of my best and most frequently visited books indefinitely. It encouraged me to start taking lessons, keep on taking lessons, consider buying my own horse and then finally to take the plunge. Through these stages I have felt down, defeated, hopeless and incompetent at times, and each time I have turned to Dr Jahiel's book to settle my mind again. Her great respect and care for both horse and rider, not too often found in the equestrian community, have been what pushed me on to where I am now - at the start of an exciting sport and a relationship with my new equine friend."
2,Good Questions...no answers,"This book is a disappointingly shallow treatment of the subject. It raises many good questions an adult rider needs to ask... but doesn't help at all in finding or interpreting the answers! Everything is dealt with in a single paragraph, and that's just not long enough. I just didn't walk away from this one with an improved point of view as I'd hoped."
1,Doesn't live up to the title,"This book really should be called Horse Ownership for the Rest Of Us -- it's not about riding, really, its more about owning a horse, how to choose your barn, etc. But if this is supposed to be written ""for the rest of us"" I don't know who the other people they're referring to are -- this book still assumes that you have the time and resources to get to the barn and ride YOUR OWN HORSE every day or thereabouts -- I'm not poor but there's no way I have the resources to buy the horse in the first place much less pay for boarding and vet care -- how about starting there? What if you don't own your own horse and have a full-time job but still want to be the best rider you can be? It was an interesting read but I gave it away, if you're looking for actual riding tips and techniques for older riders you should probably look elsewhere."
2,Riding for the rest of us: A practical guide for adult ridere,"It is not a necessary book to read. It does not teach an approach for an adult to ride a horse, it is filled with peripheral matter to investing in a horse"
5,Robin Black = Good,"I really think RB & the IRS did a great job i love the CD and their sounds are supa cool, i agree very catchy beats, my cousin hated robin black ...hated what he singed about well i played it enough times to make him reverse his opinions he also loves the CD muahaha RB & the IRS is 100% worth your money totally buy itrobin black is hot too :P"
1,planet:crap,"This album sucked. I hated it. What a rip off of 2 dollars.It makes me want to stab myself with a fork so I dont have to listen to it anymore. What a piece of crap. Avoid these 70s glam loser wannabees at all costs. I know you people feel all bad-ass saying you don't listen to popular music, but come on, this is too much. And as a note to the reviewer before me, it does not take too much to beat motley crue, even at their best."
5,poetry & comedy,"The mans acting talent is exceeded by his poetry. One of (if not the best) comedy poetry books ever written. If you hate poetry,you will love this book. I used it as a source at my college speech class."
5,Laughter,"The book is hysterical and even though it was written many, many years ago, it is still very funny today!"
1,Highly NOT Recommended,"This movie was absolutely terrible. Chinese players in a ninja movie, there were relatively few ninja scenes in the movie. Fight scenes, with and without ninja were extremely indicative of pre-50's genre - VERY slow tempo striking, NOT entertaining whatsoever. No ninjutsu could be seen. Just plain lousy."
3,"The ""Five Venoms"" in a non-Shaw film","Members of the ""Five Venoms"" made this film after leaving the Shaw Brothers studios. Don't pay attention the the review by ""A reader from Tacoma,Washington"". This film is not cut. He is confusing this film with the film Super Ninjas."
4,The Legacy of Heorot,"After having read other reviews, I just had to comment. Since when can't people just read a good book without looking for social ""significance"". It's a novel,people. Why not read it just for the pleasure. I was thoroughly caught up in the story and very much enjoyed it. It's fast moving and,in my opinion, scary. I have read several other books by the same authors and have enjoyed most of them too."
3,An entertaining read but it should be a guilty pleasure.,"I was expecting a better book based on all the praise. It was a fairly entertaining book to read but when I closed it and put it back on the shelf, I was left unsatisfied. It reads as though it was once a 150 page book that was fleshed out in a haphazard attempt to include some character development. I certainly have nothing against character development, but it can't be a patchwork effort. I enjoyed the ideas and the action but I just couldn't swallow the people :-)"
5,"Gripping, and an easy read","Book was very well done. I tend more to the sci-fantasy, but this one grabbed me and held on. I'm going to look for more by these authors. Hard to go wrong on this one, just enough literary and obscure references to keep you thinking in the background, without adding to or taking away from the story."
2,Too many cooks?,"I normally like Barnes/Pournelle/Niven, but this book isn't their best work - or at least for me it wasn't. I found myself skipping past large chunks of narrative that did little to move the story along. There's a good idea here, but the characters, pacing and bloated narrative makes it hard to plow through the book."
5,Maybe it shouldn't be a movie...,"I mean, yes, it's perfect in its action and the potential special effects, and the plot is PERFECT, but I saw Starship Troopers and I fear for the future of this story. The story doesn't even really begin until after you think it's over! If that sounds overly cryptic then read it! Incidentally I saw a leftist magazine bashing this book, presumably because Pournelle is a ""right-wing extremist."" Had the reviewer actually read this book, she would have realized that this is the most ""eco-friendly"" book this team has ever written. It shows the consequences of dealing with the environment the ""easy way."" And that's all I'm going to tell you."
4,wayne,"I found this a very good book to read,kept me interested from start to finish,would incourage anyone to read this,very good read"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A group of settlers on a planet include a lot of your smart scientific types. There is, however, one of your hard nosed, pragmatic security and military experts. He is not happy with how everything is set up.Cue horror movie plot. Animals are eaten/disappear and Beowulfesque monsters roam, although they are just the local lifeforms, with their rather odd breeding cycles. Reminiscent of Heinlein's Stobor of course.This is really pretty ordinary."
5,Alien's will never be the same,"When Alien was released, I was believing I saw the ultimate space monster. Clever, fast and deadly. I watched again that movie after reading ""The Legacy of Heorot"" and it seemed bland, straightforward, oversimple...In a surprising low number of pages, Niven's team created a incredibly rich world and characters and a credible, deadly, frightening threat. Avoiding the classic ""multiple false ends"" to relaunch the story over and over again, the authors put what would have been the end of Predator or Alien in the middle of the story, creating all the parameters for increasing danger and suspense! This construction is very clever and hooked me up until the end of the book, letting me panting and tense, as if I saw a suspense-loaded movie. I pictured every scene, carried by the evocative power of the authors, never disbelieving a single scene!Thank you, Larry, Jerry and Steven. I hope you will team up again to bring us more surprises!"
2,Disappointed,"I've been a fan of Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle for, yes, decades. Maybe that's the problem. This book was shallow, no character development. Brutal action, excessively brutal in description of destruction of the helpless, adding nothing to the story value. The ""plot"" was hard to find. Not sure if I found it. Sex and sexual inuendo was prevalent, but worthless to the plot, in my opinion. Didn't get more than 60% through the book."
4,"A refreshing, and sometimes surprising take on Gershwin","Like most of the Red, Hot releases, this CD is eclectic. The joys are found in the individual performances as opposed the the album as a whole. If you ever wondered about the african-american influences on George Gershwin, listen to Baaba Maal's take on ""Bess you Is My Woman Now"" it will break your heart with its beauty. Skye and Hubert Laws show us again why ""Summertime"" is one of the most covered songs of all time. Smoke City reinvents ""They Can't Take That Away From Me"" with their island, trip-hop beat. And, don't miss taking a journey with David Bowie and Angelo Badalemente on ""Foggy Day"" - it's moody and delicious."
4,gershwin is always good,"two years ago, i got this idea for a themed concert. i called it the 'the red hot dance concert' and asked the teachers to select songs from the red hot series, red hot and blue, red hot and dance, red hot and rio, red hot and gershwin and any others we could get our red hot hands on were under immediate consideration.for some odd reason, 'red hot and gershwin' got passed over quite a bit.i think i know why. the range of songs and treatments are great ambient music. i love davina's raspy vocals on 'i was doing all right'. they are a great compliment to the baaba maal at the end of the disc. and sinead o'connor's breathy, waif sound is a blessing to 'someone to watch over me', considering that linda ronstadt's blare-through is still upon us from some twenty years ago. stereolab's 's'wonderful' is also chic, cosmo-swirling stuff.but nothing here really gets the foot to tapping. and it really doesn't need to, either. just put it on and shake the martinis!"
2,The wolf pack fault,"Be carefull when ordering these cards because you might get the wrong set. Let me explain, These cards were created in 1995 and they were in black and white and contained only 60 cards.Anyone that knows tarot will realize that they are defficiant 18 cards.In 1999 they were revised by being made in colour and given the other 18 cards makeing them a full set.Problem is that some suppliers are still sending out the old B&W; set, You should not accept these as they are not a full set and not as illustrated on screen. Accept only the full set, 78 cards and in colour. If you are going to do tarot then do it right.I was sent a B&W; set and i've sent them back."
3,the wolf pack tarot pack,"The cards were in excellent condition but the box was disgusting!if i had of planned on giving these cards as a gift i would ""NOT"" be able to. the box was dirty, torn, very poor condition. :-("
1,Pure crap!,"As a long time wolf and tarot enthusiast I couldn't resist getting this deck. To my great dissapointment. The readings on the cards are very naive and straight forward stupid. Worst deck I've ever seen. Not worth a penny! Had to give it one star to write a review, but would give it zero."
2,Disappointed,"As a life-long Superman fan I had purchased the Superman in the 50's, 60's series which were excellent reproductions of the original comic book stories. When I ordered the Showcase Presents series, however, it broke my heart. Perhaps it was done to keep the price low, but all of the stories, though faithfully reproduced are in black and white, reading like newspaper comics. I couldn't help but feel cheated, thinking they really should have warned us. Somehow, it just isn't the same."
5,simple and sweet,"... since Little Lights was my first encounter with Rusby, I can't fault the album for not covering new ground. I loved it so much I went out and got Sleepless and Hourglass. It's really nice to hear somebody singing folk music without wearing somebody else's accent (like the American singers who try to sound British or Irish and just end up sounding silly). It's quiet, uncomplicated, beautiful music. Also fun to sing with, and good for many, many listenings."
4,Lives Up To The Hype,"Its not very often that a person/album can live up to the hype that surrounds them, but Little Lights by Kate Rusby does just that. With tracks of high quality like Playing Of Ball, Some Tyrant, Canaan's Land and Merry Green Broom it's easy to see why there is so much hype surrounding Kate. This is a must have album as its one of the standout albums of the year"
4,"Not as good as the first two, but still wonderful.","Fans of Kate Rusby will love her third album, ""little lights."" There's some great material, and Kate sparkles on the uptempo songs, especially ""i courted a sailor"" and ""william and davy."" I dare anyone not to cry the first time they listen to the album's last song, ""my young man."" But the slow songs tend to drag and leave one wanting her to pick up the tempo a bit. (With the exception of the aforementioned ""my young man"" and the beautiful ""matt hyland."")The album is great but lacks a little something that ""Sleepless"" and ""Hourlglass"" had. If you're a die-hard fan like me, you'd listen to Kate sing just about anything. But if you'd like an introduction to her work, I'd suggest buying one of the first two albums and then giving ""little lights"" a listen."
3,they all sound the same,"I'm afraid I must agree with Sukeydebby's review of Little Lights. All the songs end up sounding the same. Lovely, yes, but Kate really needs to try some new arrangements or select (or write) more upbeat songs. I wonder if it's her producer, or her choice of arrangements that is to blame. (Compare Andy M. Stewart's superior version of ""Matt Hyland"", for one.) She needs to develop. Again, don't get me wrong, I love her voice, and the songs taken one at a time are fine. It's just that listening to the entire album in one sitting leaves you frustrated, and, frankly, a bit bored. She can do much better than this, I think."
1,Sickeningly bland and unoriginal,"British indie is in a terrible state at the moment, and these guys are typical of the epidemic- soulless, bland and turgid. The singer has a horrendous empty voice, even when supposedly singing something emotional he falls flat. This song evidently things it is very clever, by being a song about a song, but it comes across as a bunch of students showing off. Once you reach the end, where having supposedly poured his little heart out the singer tries to finish it off, it becomes cringeworthy."
4,Good collection for its time,"This collection is a good primer for those who wantto sample Sparks' output before they go back andacquire the old LP's and CD's, or for fans who alreadyhave the old stuff, it's a good review for the erasit covers (the 1970's & 1980's).The only drawback is that I bought this when Rhinowas not putting slipcases on their 2-CD sets - would'vebeen nice to have that as well."
4,excellent collection but a glaring omission,"excellent collection, but how could they have left out ""Eaten By The Monster Of Love""?"
5,Fabulous!,"This is a fabulous, beautiful book as are many Rizzoli books. It is not perfect as to attributions etc, so scholars may quibble, but for inspiration and a wonderful overview of international beading with small beads it is terrific! I am going off for my first class in peyote beading this morning and this was a perfect source of ideas and information to get me charged up! It is not, however, a how to book. There is a technical section at the end describing how the various techniques are done but not in anyway sufficient to make any projects. The descriptions are clear but not detailed enough for that. To attempt any of these techniques the reader will need a good teacher and most probably additional books."
3,Breaking the Barrier,"Spike Lee; an outspoken writer, actor, producer, bussinessman and noted director Spike Lee hasn't rested on his achievments rather he keeps going. When I read this book it really caught my eye this man is really out to help his race break through the barrier that has held them back since slavery. He even stipulates in his contracts for movies and commercials that blacks be hired to work behind the scenes. I truly believe that this book brought out his inner-character, which I truly believe I can get an understanding for now that I read this inspirational book. I recommend this book for anyone who believes strongly in self-character because Spike Lee's got it."
4,A Beautiful Introduction to Angels,"This book's cover doesn't begin to prepare you for the stunning graphic design and artwork inside. A history of angels and their relevance within the major religions is explained, followed by a nice ""Who's Who"" of the major angels. The descriptions of how to invoke and petition the angels were interesting, though I felt that I wanted more information before getting involved at that level. Worth purchasing for the artwork alone, even if you aren't an Angelophile. I'm giving it 4 stars only because I wish it was more comprehensive."
2,A Lack of Musical Architecture Indeed....,"Unlike the reviewer below, I believe that Frederic Chiu was wisely shown the exit after the second round of the Van Cliburn competition. Certainly his technical powers as a pianist are undeniable, but a thinking musician who allows the music to speak naturally without disruptive and individualistic statements he is not. As is sadly the case with many young performers these days, we are first made aware of Chiu's abilities and only afterward are we allowed to hear the beauty of Mendelssohn's music - and beautiful music it is. Anyone who has heard these works in the hands of a great musician (like Perahia) will hear at once the chasm that stands between such selfless interpretation and the land of Chiu. Menham Pressler said at the competition, ""I want to meet another lover of music, I don't want to meet another player."" Perhaps this disc is the best explanation for Chiu's failure in Fort Worth - buy it if you want to hear him and not Mendelssohn."
3,Alright and nothing beyond that.,"The diagrams are well done and there is an excellent explanation of blocking. My biggest issue with this book is that it claims to be aimed at beginners but the patterns are not written as simply as they could be; in one pattern it says to decrease your 60 stitches three times. Shouldn't that be something like - k10, k2tog, k20, k2tog, k20, k2tog, k10? One of the skills of knitting that most people need to be guided through is the math."
2,It would have been better if I hadn't seen VERTIGO,"I suppose the plot would have been more of a mind-bender if I hadn't seen Alfred Hitchcock's VERTIGO. As it was, many of the plot twists were the same, and the character construction just couldn't live up to Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly. I'm always on the lookout for another director with the ability to present complex human emotions and incredible character depth while weaving plot twists that make you dizzy. I just don't think I've found it with this movie."
2,Difficult to get into,"This book is really hard to read. The Scotch slang is really hard to decipher at times, and wading through English-Scottish politics is not my idea of a captivating book. So far reading this book has been a bore, but I'm hoping the author will be able to redeem herself with a good plot later on. I'm only a few chapters into it so far."
3,When Scripts Change,"If you're getting this novel because you liked the movie be warned that this novel is obviously based on one of the early drafts of the script and the actual Predator is very different compared to its movie counterpart. The Predator in this is not a honorable hunter, it is a shape-shifting creature that kills humans because it wants to learn about them; like a scientist, not a hunter.This is an enjoyable read by itself, but definitely not for someone who wants something going into detail about the actual Predator alien and the movie. The novelization of the second Predator film is much better if you're looking for something that is more true to the final movie-product."
2,Unreliable product - failed after 2 years,"After only two years of use, the integrated circuit board ( Part # 20380S ) failed on this unit causing the door to close partially, then reopen. I spoke with Genie Support and they walked me through several troubleshooting steps and confirmed the circuit board was bad. They offered to sell me a new one for $80, which was hard to swallow considering I only paid $129.99 for this when purchased new. The warranty is only 1 year. Their customer service was knowledgeable and friendly which is why I'm giving this 2 stars instead of 1."
2,Quality Problem,"The control circuit board failed after less than three years of use, causing the opener to fail to close the door on an intermittent basis. I was told by a service company that this is a common problem with the Genie Chain Glide models. But Genie does not offer to address it as an inherent problem. It would cost as much to have the board replaced as to purchase a new opener. Find another more reliable model."
1,Poor product,"My GCG350 failed after 3 yrs. It suddenly started to behave erratically, would start closing and immediatly open again. I found that the solder joint to the transformer on the control board became loose. After fixing that it still failed. Eventually it failed to detect the open limit switch and the motor took all the chain in, locked up and broke a plastic piece! The end. I think my old Craftsman lasted 30 yrs and I changed that poor thing 'cause it didn't have a remote..."
1,It broke after a couple of months,It worked good for a couple of months and then it broke. I was told I had to get a hold of CTA for a replacement/repair.
5,"Good, cheap charger","Bought this when we lost our original Canon charger that came with our camera. So far I haven't had any problems with it at all. Holds a charge great and I didn't notice it taking longer to charge. It's even better than our Canon one was because it has a car adapter and, hey, it was less than $10! Definitely recommend."
4,Works well.,"So far, this works well, and although I can't tell you whether its faster or slower than a normal Canon charger, it serves its purpose and charges the battery!"
1,JOke?,This product has to be a joke. It does not hold a double A rechargeable battery. There is nothing to hold the battery in place. Be sure to investigate this product thoroughly before throwing away your money.
4,CTA DIGITAL MR-NB5L Mini Battery Charger for Canon NB-5L Battery,"works OK but is slower than the OEM charger. Instead of a green when the charge is done, the indicator goes out...curiously backwards. Otherwise a good value!"
1,Did not charge my battery,"The product info said it charges cannon batteries, and i have the model mentioned in the description, yet when i tried charging it, it wouldn't work at all. I don't know if the device itself was not working or it simply is not meant for my battery model. I still have a low charge in my battery (my camera still turns on). I regret buying it."
5,BREASTFEEDING REALITY,"I have read numerous books on nursing and this is the only one I found that gives the truth about breastfeeding. Like it isn't always free, be ready to lay down some cash for things that make nursing tons easier like nursing pillows, stools, pumps, bras, pads, lacation consultant, and easy to prepare foods for you."
3,"Informative, but too repetitive","This book does share a lot of important information on breastfeeding and resolving complications, but I found it to be too repetitive. If the book was better editted and organized, it could be at least half as long. Also, the author repeatedly goes into a political debate on why breastfeeding is the best choice for your child. If I didn't already agree with this point, I wouldn't have bought the book in the first place."
3,Unknown,I'm giving this a 3 star because I only skimmed it. I had received another breastfeeding book that answered all my questions. But this one looks to have a lot of the same information in it!
3,Not quite what I expected.,"Although this book will be wonderful to have as a reference tool (I would almost be inclined to say an ESSENTIAL reference tool) I was a little disappointed by it, in that it tends to read like a textbook. This resulted in my forcing myself to continue, rather than being so engrossed that I couldn't put it down. It seems to be repetitive in that it discusses various elements of an idea or concept several times throughout the book, rather than putting it all in one section. I believe that there is a great deal that can be learned from the information contained in this book, but the presentation leaves much to be desired."
5,golfs true legend,"First this is NOT a professionally shot video.It is a friend of Moes ( Dr.Suttie)on a VHS handy cam, but the footage is AMAZING!!.It has plenty of slow motion and Moe explaining everything about his swing.This is a absolute must for any Moe fan.I wish I could have met him when he was alive but I kinda feel like i have met him now.I would wanna thank him for making me a better golfer.I live in Australia where nobody knows anything about Moe and when people see me on the range they think there is something wrong with me when I get in my set up but after watching my 3 wood hitting 240 yards dead straight they kind of figure I know what I am what I'm doing.You really get to see what a jolly and fun guy Moe was.He's laughing and joking all the way through this video.Hes no where near a weird as the stories going round make him out to be.Whats amazing is this is him at 65 i can't imagine he would have been like in his prime.Thanks Moe and DR.Suttie for releasing this video."
2,Reluctant two stars,"I gave it two stars, reluctantly, because despite the libertarian politico-economic spouting of some of the characters, and the tired back and forth across centuries, the first half or so of the book at least had some suspense and (slow and creaky) character development, and an expectation of an exciting and interesting denouement. But by the end I was left sitting there thinking, ""That's it? That's it?!""All along I kept thinking that there had to be something about the object of the search other than its simple existence. Why otherwise would one side try so valiantly to find it, and the other side so desperately to keep it hidden. Why, indeed? I'm still wondering...Pass this one up. I've been a fan of Poul Anderson's for a long time, but some of his latter-day stuff just isn't up to it. This is one fine example."
2,Bloated,"The book is twice the length it should have been.There are also jarring things like the gratuitious use ofcommon Spanish phrases, as if they would replace Englishones in common use but nothing else, and the gratuitoususe of Hawaiian (which far fewer of us know).And then there are the undefined neologisms"
4,A very good disc,This disc contains many well known songs and they are performed beautifully by Chick Webb's great band. If you haven't heard Webb you are missing the very best that swing has to offer. I have been enjoying this disc for a week and don't tire of listening as it is so sweet. The only thing better is the 100 star disc Swing Sation Series ~ Ella Fitzgerald & Chick Webb. Do yourself a favor and buy them both.
3,52 blocks,great video it really shows alot about the fighting system but it does not teach u how to fight it its more of a documentary of what 52 blocks is
5,Great Summary,I think that this DVD is a great sum up for what the Style is. I would Like to see more information on the subject but for what it cost It is definetly worth it!
3,The Strange Vengeance of Rosalie,"A stranded and dirty teenage girl is picked up along a desolate strip of highway by a traveling salesman. Being very straight-lace as defined by the times, he's at a loss as to how to react to (and protect himself from) the primal instincts of a lost, lonely little girl.""The Strange Vengeance of Rosalie"" (1972) is one of my favorite creepy film of the '70s. Rosalie is the girl you, at times, feel sorry for and, at times, are just simply disgusted with. Bonnie Bedelia does a wonderful job of playing her with a very hard stubborn edge that can drive you crazy. Richard (Ken Howard) is very clean and white in comparison to a brown and dusty landscape filled with brown, dusty people. He stands out like a cultivated plant in a wild desert garden.You will leave this movie feeling bewildered and frustrated. I think it is the kind of movie that deserves to be reevaluated."
1,BOOTLEG - VHS TRANSFER>>STAY AWAY,This DVD is a Cheap VHS Transfer to DVD. The person used either a PANASONIC DMR-20 or 30 from about 10 years ago to do the transfer. I know they used this equipment as I had the same machines. Will Be returning this Bootleg Recording!!
3,WHATS WHAT OF PUNISHER WEAPONS,This series of comics was a guide to the vigilante punisher's weapons . As simple as that ! no story just fantsic art by Eliot R Brown showing various people killing devices as well as defensive type ones...... only really for seriously SERIOUS punisher fans if you know what i mean....really strange thing was it was all real life weapons and stuff!!!! no comic ray guns here !!!!
3,Great characters,"This movie is a simple scary monster movie with a lot of suspense and some of the greatest characters to hit the big screen, there are some really funny scenes and good special effects, some scenes are a little to gory for younger children but most of it is just fun."
3,"FantasticDan and Bugster say ""it aint jaws but its close""","Think of three things you want to see when you go to the movies. If you answered giant crocodile, obese town sherrif, and Oliver Platt, then Lake Placid is the movie for you!Wittness the terror of the beaver dam, a cow being dangled from a helicopter, and a showdown between a crocodile and a grizzily bear. Its actualy a pretty good movie, even if it is kind of stupid. It is fun to watch and the special effects are good. Its worth renting but i wouldn't waste my money buying it, unless you can find it cheap somewhere. Betty White is amusing as a foulmouthed old lady."
4,Great Creature Feature,"This movie is a great addition to anyone's creature movie collection. Not really scary, but good graphics for those that appreciate that sort of thing. Also some funny scenes. Not like those cheesy alligator in the sewer movies."
2,just read the review,"This movie is complete trash. Don't go out of you way at all to see this. There is nothing entertaining in it except maybe a couple of interesting scenes containing gore. One scene the aligator jumps along the side of the boat. When the water settles you see the deputy has no head anymore, it was cleanly taken of at the neck. I gave it two stars only because it had decent visuals. Do not see this. If you want to see a horror mutant animal movie go see Deep Blue Sea or ANY others, just not this piece of garbage. Let's see if this review pisses any lake placid fan off."
1,Awful!,"This is the worst film of last year. There is nothing positive to say about it. The script is a joke, the actors are irritating, especially Bridget Fonda and the dialouge is not at all funny. If you wanna flushyour money down the toilet then go right ahead. I am still wondering why I bought it. It's just a risk you take by buying a movie you haven't seen. Somtimes they are really good and somtimes they are bad but this one is the worst movie I've bought."
2,What A Croc!,The few scenes with the CGI croc are pretty damn good. Too bad they didn't stay with it.This seems to have been done by people who don't get the horror genre--and it shows. Too bad. Could have been something truly great.
1,I can't see what all the fuss is about!,"Having seen this film before it's release in the UK, I am astonished at the reaction from all the movie buffs over here. Every review, in my opinion, has gone completely over the top. Although mildly entertaining, comments like ""hilarious"" and ""the best horror movie you'll see all year"" are way off the mark. The best thing about the movie for me was the fact that it was so short. Without wishing to spoil the movie for anybody else just as you're finally expecting something exciting and scary to happen, the film ends."
3,This movie was dumb ass funny.,"I laughed my ass off at all the funny scenes in this movie. I loved Oliver Platt's character, and the scene with him arguing with the sherif after he found him in the bushes was funny as hell. I loved Bridget Fonda's character too, and she spit out some the funniest dialogue i've ever heard in a horror movie. It might not be an excellent movie, but it's guaranteed to give you one great time."
4,Not Jaws but........,"Lake Placid will never be Jaws, but then what can top an original? I enjoyed this movie, if only for Betty White. The FX were excellent, story fair, but Ms. White's character stole the show. I'm sure she wasen't the only one rooting for the Crocodile!"
5,I love this movie,"This is one of my favorite movies for many reasons. Betty White does a wonderful job with her character. The action scenes are fun, and there's a little romance and some scary stuff. Have watched it probably 25 times, which for me is a lot. It's one I go back to when I want to be entertained. Some really terrific performances by other actors as well."
3,Funnier than some comedies...,"Lake Placid is a comic horror spoof with plenty of gory scenes and many funny scenes. The characters are all a delight especially the eccentric Oliver Platt's character. I thought it was gonna' be a 'Jaws' rip-off, but I was wrong. This is a very entertaining popcorn-kinda-film that is funnier than such crap comedies as 'Big Mommas House'..."
2,"Has it's moments, but bad all around.","Let's first say that these movies always seem to pair up the male/female protagonists. Here it's Bridget Fonda and Bill Pullman. Also you know with the rules of moviedom, unless they are happily married, they will end up together. Well, if it's inevitable, how come they have no chemistry?And why is Oliver Platt's character so deliberately annoying? The only redeeming character in the movie is Betty White, who seemed to have taken a few lessons at the Gary Oldman school of overdoing things. However, I relished her damned wit and the writers gave her all the best one liners.The movie is not scary and we are left with only a few false scares to cling to. Even when the alligator shows itself, are we experiencing a greater heart rate of that of a person sleeping peacefully. This movie is just sooooo boring.Rating: C-"
2,No Different than a 50s Monster Movie,"LAKE PLACID * * The one about the giant alligator in a Maine lake, with a script by David E. Kelley (""The Practice"", ""Ally McBeal""). I have no idea why money was spent on a thriller no different than a 50s monster movie, but it's reasonably entertaining and any movie with Bridget Fonda is a worth checking out. Betty White is kind of amusing as a foul-mouthed local, and there's a pretty cool gore scene in the beginning."
2,Lake Boring,"I keep comparing this to Jaws. Why can't any animal horror movie be better than Jaws - for 25 years! ) I don't even find Anaconda impressive, yet this is called ""this year's Anaconda"". The casts are either soulless (Bridget Fonda, Bill Pullman) or annoying (Oliver Platt)."
2,what was that?,"I watched this movie on Pay Perview last night and boy am I glad I didn't buy it. This movie is neither fish nor meat. A sorry attempt to be a spoof maybe? Poor dialogue throughout. Not remotely funny, not scary...it's just nothing trying to be something. I am not even talking about the unlikelyhood of an aligator ending up in Maine, I could live with that improbability, I am not proud :-). The two stars I am giving are for Betty White and the gator. The effects are pretty good and there were one or two scenes that made me jump but that is all I got out of it. Rent it...save your money."
3,SO SO,"I think one reviewer went overboard calling this movie ""brilliant""? Yes it was campy and over the top. Betty White's character was kinda sorta funny but it was so obvious they were trying way too hard to be shocking. Of course hearing Betty White say the f word is gonna make your jaw drop. Lake Placid tried to capitalize on this approach and at times it worked. The humour was shocking and offensive but also overdone. It became tedious at times, each scene getting worse and worse as the movie went along. Finally, the movie disinigrated towards the very end. I was actually hoping the alligator was going to kill all of them (except for the cow in the sling), which by the way was a very cruel tactic. Who I really wanted to see get it was Oliver Platt's character. Why wasn't he thrashed by the alligater? He deserved it! The jerk! Did anyone notice the bad rhinoplasty on Bridget Fonda? Try using better lighting! I'm sure Bridget was not pleased!"
3,"""Is this the man who was killed?""","Lake placid is about a crocodile living in a lake in maine. When someone is heaved screaming onto a boat half missing and dies, an investigation starts.Lake Placid is quite scary but more funny. I was in stitches when I saw it. The first half an hour is good, but after that you begin to lose interest. Not enough people are mercilessly devoured by the 30 foot reptile. But overall a great movie.A good laugh with some greusome, bloody bits in, a good movie to watch on a boring saturday night."
2,This really could have been a lot of fun.,"A giant crocodile is inhabiting an idyllic lake in Maine and its up to Bill Pullman, Bridget Fonda, and Brendan Gleeson to stop it. Written by David E. Kelly, this mixture of horror and comedy has a few good laughs, but it's ultimately Ally Macbeal with a crocodile. Too bad 60% of the movie focuses more on trying to create ""quirky"" characters (Oliver Platt is immensely annoying) than actually dealing with the crocodile situation. This could have been a lot of fun, especially since the creature effects are terrific, but almost all thrill potential is wasted. Not awful, but certainly not good."
1,IS THIS A MOVIE?,"After seeing this movie advertised on tv, I thought that I just had to get it on DVD. This would have to be one of the poorest made movies that I have ever seen. Its very predictable, the acting is sub standard,there is very little action, the story line is weak and cheesy, and its a very short movie. It was hard to stay awake while watching this 1 hour long movie."
2,Too stupid to be entertaining...,"The problem with this film is that it doesn't know when to quit. If it's supposed to be a comedy then it should be funny, not stupid...and I love Oliver Platt, but his charactor was so retarded that he made the film almost unwatchable. The premise was neat and I love these 'huge animals take over and eat people' type films, and the croc looks awsome, but theres so much corny dialog that the film suffers becasue of it...and Bridget Fonda's charactor is so unbelievable annoying I was praying that the croc would just eat her! The ending was cool, but getting there was exasperating. I also found it humourus that they name the movie 'Lake Placid' when Lake Placid is in Florida and they were in Maine on a lake called 'Black Lake'...so why not name the movie 'Black Lake'? It just adds to the stupidity of the film. One reviewer said that this was parady...well then it should have been funny, not stupid!"
3,How strange is this?,"Wait a minute....what's going on here? Bridget Fonda hangs around to look for a big croc after seeing someone get their head bitten off - why? - because she doesn't want to go back to a failed relationship (surely she should try a dating agency instead). This film is really weird. I liked most of the comedy elements (ie everyone insulting each other) but it seemed that the croc was only incidental. Where is the body count? Why does Bill Pulman always sleep-walk his way through his roles? Where were the rest of the Golden Girls? The croc itself looked pretty cool in some parts (especially the bear scene) but rubbery in the close ups. Unlike the film Alligator (which I think is far better) there is no tension & you end up wanting the cast to leap Lemming-like into the lake. If you like very unrealistic characters who constently fight (again very amusing) go and see this film. Oh yeah, and I think a croc turns up as well. (I would give this film 2.5 stars but it won't let me)"
2,Very disappointing,"Like some of the other reviewers, I agree that the movie had great potential. Also, like some of the other reviewers, it fell far short of its potential. I regret having wasted my money on it. As at least one other reviewer put it, much of the movie seemed to be missing. It was too short and underdeveloped -- I felt cheated."
3,A humorous monster movie,"I got the feeling this was a made for Bridget Fonda movie.A giant crocodile takes up eating the wrong food... peoplewhen a fish and game beaver bander is killed.Fonda plays a paleontologist sent to identify a tooth taken from the body.An unlikely reason for her to be camping on the lakeside with the local sheriff, an handsome fish and game fellow anda crocodile hunter. From there is goes downward with a cursingBetty White as a local resident whose ""pet"" the croc is.The result is besides the gore of people getting their heads eatenkind of funny, but no really good laughs."
3,An Okey film,"This film was released befor Deep blue sea. Here the sythnesis two crocodile some how never review managed to get into a lake in Main. A gore movie rate r for Bad langue gore violence. Not as good as alligator series but still a good movie.The part at the end when the old lad is feeding the adult crocdiles offspring is hilarious. The old Lady delivers soem funy a humerous lines.If you like this I recomend Crocodile 1 Crodile 2, Blood Surf, Alligator 1 and Alligaotr 2 the Mutation and Dino Croc"
3,An Off The Wall Horror Story,"A Classic Lake Placid is not. However entertaining it certainly is. The crocodile attacks are so sudden that anyone will certainly be taken by surprise. Somehow the motion of the crocodile does not seem to relistic. But then agan I an expert on crocodiles. I'll defer to the guru in the move.In spite of constant bickering between the cast members, someone this movie has an intriguing hold on me. Bridget Fonda's tempermental character is oh so annoying. Her reason for venturing to Maine is quite ridiculous. The story does unfold with a few unpredictable seasons. I sure did not expect the crocodile to attack the bear so visciously. The use of the cow as bait is quite hillarious. Gosh that Betty White plays such a goofball.Again, Lake Placid is not the stuff that legends are made of. Its just too far fetched in many spots. However as a light campy comedic horror adventure, Lake Placid will give you a few chuckles as well as some gasps as the crocodile attacks its victims."
4,Worth the 82 minutes,"This movie is very good. Maybe I liked this movie because the acting was not bad for this kind of films, and for the very good croc in both its CG and animatronic versions. I notice that this movie is compared many times with the movie Anaconda. I honestly do not see many similarities between those movies and the reason why they are compared so much. Both movies were good but I personally liked more Lake Placid than Anaconda. The movie has its flaws but I'm not going to list the bad things. Good for the price of $9.99 and I personally also liked the direct-to-video sequel which might be in big disagreement with most people who have rated the product but its not worth the price of $19.99. Recommend it to everyones who likes this genre."
4,Very entertaining,"This is a fabulous monster movie. It has some moderate horror moments but also contains a number of laugh out-loud moments, making it the best horror-comedy since ""An American Werewolf in London"" 18 years earlier. The story is pretty obvious from the DVD cover so I won't discuss that. Acting honours go to Betty White as Mrs Bickerman, but mostly to Brendan Gleeson who is marvellous as the local Sheriff.Interestingly the director is Steve Minor a veteran director of many slasher horror films (Friday 13th Part II etc). He also worked on the notorious ""Last House on the Left"" in the early 1970's. It just goes to show how age can mellow you.I think it holds up to repeated viewings, and having already seen it a couple of times, I've now bought the DVD. Its only 82 minutes long so it doesn't overstay its welcome, unlike the Crocodile...."
3,Lake Sarcastic,"You must see this movie, if for nothing else other than the sarcasm. This movie is loaded with it from the very beginnig diver boating scene. I love these types of movies, It's a chompum' up movie that doesn't take itself serious. Of course it's about a giant alligator so someone has to get chomped, but the movie brings you right back to laughter with a moment of sarcasm. Check this one out, you'll begin to laugh even when people are being chomped. The only downside is it's a bit short for todays movie length standards."
5,One of the best of 1999,"This movie was great! it had doses of all that goes to make a movie enjoyable,humor,suspense,good characters,lots of action,and eye popping special effects. It was good on every level,they could not have chosen better actors,Fonda was perfectly out of place in her role,Platt was obnoxiously great,White was a delight,the guy who played the much put upon sheriff (sorry I don't know his name) was great and Pullman as the fish and game expert was equally well cast.I also enjoyed the way this movie did'nt bog you down with too much detail (example:the waterlogged Titanic) it got right to the point and that was a good move.All this combined made this movie one of the years best,behind only Episode 1."
5,"If you get it, you'll love it!","This is a picture that to the simple viewer will appear to be a campy B-horror flick; however, this is most definately not the case. Make no mistake about it, the makers of this picture knew exactly what they were doing when they put together this cast with this dialogue. The result is nothing short of hilarious with the just the right amount of chills to place it in the horror genre. If you just don't understand the popularity of this picture after seeing it, you probably wouldn't enjoy The Simpsons either, but fear not, there's always Barney..."
4,Steve Miner's best film yet.,"This has to have been the funniest film of 1999. Director Steve Miner gives us one of his best films to date, next to ""House"" anyway. All the performances are credible and Oliver Platt gives the best performance out of everyone. But of course, the crocodile outshines them all. This film is a must for horror fans."
2,Had Potential,"Great actors in a weak script. It's entertaining enough for the genre with the help of a short running time. The treatment of animals is upsetting, and Betty White's eccentric character comes off totally annoying. There is wonderful chemistry between the always excellent Oliver Platt and the deputy Sharon played by Meredith Salanger. One wishes that it could have been developed more, but that's another script. David Kelley (of the excellent ""Picket Fences"" and ""The Practice,"" as well as the awful creep-fest ""Ally McBeal"") doesn't come through on this script."
5,FUNtastic,"Been waiting years for a decent jaws style film? Deep Blue Sea wasn't quite your thing? Then this could be just what you've been waiting for. A fast paced creature feature which has it all: great characters, fun plot (not totally unfeasable)with some teasing twists. The effects are stunning and the DVD transfer is fantastic; a sharp picture with an awesome dolby 5.1 sound track. However, a word of warning to hard core gore fans, this film is built more around ""jumpiness"" than visual blood and guts, not to say that the film doesn't have its gorier moments. Overall this is a funny, light hearted approach which should be enjoyed by anybody who doesn't take life too seriously."
3,"Nice idea, just too short!","I agree with the general comments about this film, it had a nice trailer and seemed like a great horror/thriller, but as stated in other reviews it was too short. I agree that the movie had great potential, but was too short, and got to the point too fast. Don't get me wrong, it is a above average film, with great special effects, and as funny as it is scary. The movie just needed a little more direction in sections, as well as being about another 20 minutes longer. The DVD is well presented and has some nice extras. A good movie, just not as good as Deep Blue Sea."
2,Disappointing.,"I really found this film boring. The actors try too hard, the special effects look fake as, the direction is absolutely awful and the screenplay is even worse. So all of you who saw it is a masterpeice of work and a great comedy, I think you should look more carefully at the film's quality. I mean, more time is spent on land than in the sea and you get scared from the actors not the crocodile.I think you should see 'Deep Blue Sea' - it is seriously sooo much better."
2,What a rip-off!,"This movie is one of the worst! The plot is extrimly stuped! Basicly; it's about a giant crocodile, that lives in this lake, and eats people. And this is the dumbest part: an old lady takes care of the monster by feeding it cows! It is sooooooo dumb! I don't know why they rated it R...it's not scary, and has just a little language. The reason i gave it two stars is because i did like the special effects, i thought the crocodile was cool, but the plot was just awful."
2,From the May issue of IRS.theroadlesstraveled.org,"This one is so marginally tolerable you could ALMOST give in - wait for it to show up on cable, blundered upon by channel surfing, and stand it for whatever length you deem worthy. It will seem fun then. Rent it, and your pizza arrives lukewarm. The good news: the computer animated crocodile is very cool."
2,Another giant animal runs amonk in the northern Maine!,"This movie is basically last summer's ""Anaconda""in which a giant croc is killing off the widlife and those unlucky enough to meet it face to face! The movie has a decent enough cast ,just it kinda hard to tell if it's a horror,science fiction,mushy or comedy movie! The DVD of this movie has Betty White Saying things she says in the movie! The sound is quite good,but Fox still seems to be lacking extras on their DVD's ! Buy this movie if your a fan of B grade horror movies or a fan of the very similar movie ""Anoconda""!"
2,Placid Film,"When I watched this film I expected to see a good horror/thriller type movie, not a Jaws-Deep Rising remake. Although there was some humour in the film and some nice gore scenes I would recomend you rent the film first before purchasing it. The biggest disappointment about the film was the ending, it was so slow and so tame that I was considering switching over to the Terry Wogan show. On the good side some of the C.G was really nice and there was some good humour in the film but overall I would buy Deep Rising instead."
2,Bad Movie,"Really bad movie. I like Bill Pullman because he is a UMass guy, but this movie was really stupid. Rent it if you want, but do not buy it."
2,Lake Placid is not good,"Boring, Stupid, A couple of laughs. Oliver Platt is funny, but the movie is an overall FLOP! CHEER for the alligator to destroy all the evidence!"
2,WORST ACTING I'VE EVER SEEN,"First off, the acting stunk. That gives it a one. But it kept me watching from a LITTLE suspense so that gave it a two. DON'T, and i repeat, DON'T buy the movie or rent it. You will just be wasting your money and time"
3,Big Crock in a Shallow script,"Cheesy, Hokey Story. I like monster movies but this only has a few good scenes but it could have been much better. The special effects seemed low budget.. the crock looked real but just put in the scene like in the old Sinbad movies. I wont ever buy this on DVD..."
2,"see ""deep blue sea"" instead","i gave this two stars because of the gore and maybe a couple scares.deep blue sea was extremely more scarier than this.this movie is very boring.even though it says it is supposed to be funny it is not for me.probably because it is dark humor and that doesnt make me laugh,(except for ""jawbreaker"" with Rose Mcgowan!)you might like this,you might noti know this movie will never get any stars except for maybe 1 because of Oliver Platt"
1,If I could rate this at zero I would.,So stupid! It was exactly like Deep Blue Sea dumb and the same things happened over and over again. Impossible things happened that wouldn't in the world that we have BRAINS! This movie is a disgrace to american movies! To all the people who don't want to waste their money on movies take my word this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. It is not even scary. Even the dumbest people could realize that! I hope I have told you how bad the movie is!
3,Not ready for big screen TV,"I love this movie, with it's off-beat humor and excellent special effects. This DVD version, however, is not the best. I had orignally gotten a copy using cereal box tops, but the picture was not enhanced for big screen TVs, and appeared as a small picture with black bands around all sides. I could zoom in to get it to fill most of the screen, but that reduced the resolution. Worse, however, was the sound. The background music and the special effects noises were extremely loud, while the witty dialogue was almost inaudible. Because the copy I had was obviously an old and inexpensive version, I bought a new copy, hoping it would be better, but no such luck. The new copy has the same problems as the old. I'm hoping that a blu-ray digitally enhanced version will be released that presents the movie the way it was in the theatres."
3,bad movie good actors,"OK the creation of the aligator in this movie sucked, it was too much like a normal aligator. It needed to be bigger and much more powerful like the one on the movie Crocidle. I also did not agree with the ending of this movie no science fiction movie ends with the hero's capturing the bease. However I have to give this film 3 stars, because it did have good actors and a good script."
1,Not worth it!!!!!,"This movie would have been O.K if it weren't for that sorry ending. I think it was stupid that they chose not to kill a crocodile of that size. By the time the ending came, and the credits started rolling, and I just knew that wasn't the end. I was so disappointed in ""Lake Placid"" that I couldn't wait to take that tape back to Blockbuster. Betty White does make it kind of funny though but, the movie as a whole isn't very good. I still can't get over the fact that at the end all they show you is the crocodile being drugged up, strapped to the back of an 18 wheeler, and driven down the road. I could only imagine where they were taking it. What sense does that make? I guess in true Hollywood fashion they had to leave the door open for a sequel. In the sequel, I guess by the time they get to their destination the drugs will probably have worn off the crocodile, he gets off the 18 Wheeler, eat all of them up, and break out into the city."
4,"Short,(1hr 18min) But Sweet!","I thought this movie was cool, I even got on the edge of my seat a few times,Betty White definately rules in this one ""Is that a crime? To wish the chewing of law inforcement?"". I wish that they had done more with it, but what can ya do?"
1,You must be kidding,"Having just read reviews of this movie which use the words, ""brilliant"", and ""funny"", I felt that I must comment. This is an apallingly movie. It is brilliant if you enjoy movies with no plot or substance. Do you like to know about twenty minutes in advance exactly what is going to happen in a film? Great! Buy it! It is funny if you are a fan of hearing the same stupid jokes that have been used again and again in other terrible movies. Do you like to see extremely fake looking reptiles swimming around biting off heads? How about second rate actors who have three facial expressions that they seem to feel work for all occaisons? If so, then this one's for you. Sorry to be so vehement but I would hate for anyone to waste their money based on the comments presented here. Trust me - this movie is not worth the three dollars it takes to rent it on video."
1,"Amazing, incredibale, a total waste of time","when I got this movie and when I saw it's cover I thought to my self that this is gona be a cheerful night, I'll watch something special, but when I saw the first 30 min. I told my self that things will be better as the action always be in the last 15 min. after that in the last 5 min I told my self that the end will be something special !!!!!. at the end I said that this is a total waste of time. it's all about a giant lizard who lives in a very strange environment eating the (flying cows) and there are a few scientists who are wasting there time looking for something they do not know. much much like Godzila. just a fiction fiction and nothing but hallucinations."
4,Trip to Maine is a crocodile pain,"Not really, but it is if you become a crocodile victim. This is not a blood and gore animal chomping fest as it is a high adventure story of discovering a mammoth crocodile in waters that should have no teeth. Groups of lawmen, scientists, and rangers gather to find the culprit behind bloody corpses and decapitated heads laying around at usual quiet resort lake facility, including a crocodile expert who seeks to find it mano y mano.There are many comedy bits, but that does not deter from focusing on finding a giant croc. The extras are neat, and the movie involving, which makes for a descent dvd package. Betty White shines again in small role of lady of the lake. Crocodile has no personality other than a rampaging eating machine watching and waiting for its next meal. Location shots put you directly in the tents of investigators. Did I say gators?"
3,NO GREAT AMBITIONS....,"This film was clearly shot with no pretentions at all other than produce some laughs and some money . The ""evil"" crocodile doesn't kill almost anyone in the entire movie ! ( this was something really cool and different from other ""monsters"" movies "" ). Pullman and Fonda are clearly working just for their paychecks, but they manage to survive. PLatt is awful."
3,Unique,"Does David E. Kelley have a pile of scripts in his bottom drawer like this one (and ""Mystery, Alaska"") which he wrote when he was a teenager and now sells for seven figures just because he can? Or does he toss them off for light relief between episodes of whichever multi-Emmy winning series he happens to be penning these days? Whatever the case, I'm bemused by the existence of such strange little movies, and more than a little entertained. ""Lake Placid"" is pitched like a monster flick but plays more like a TV dramedy - it's sort of like ""Picket Fences"" meets ""Buffy"" on the set of ""Jurassic Park"". It's weird, but it works. The high-calibre cast is highly watchable, the genre shifts keep you guessing and, as always with Kelley, the characters and dialogue are superb. I'm sure fans of true monster movies will find this lame to the point of insult, but for me it was strangely, surprisingly, amusing."
5,Unashamedly Formula,"If you follow a tried and true plot formula, where a giant <insert animal> appears in <insert unlikely location> and proceeds to eat people, you are totally free to spend all yout time working out amusing dialog and entertaining interactions for your characters. That's precisely what Lake Placid does. Whether it's the sheriff's classification of everyone he meets by their type of rudeness, or Betty White's hilariously foul mouth, you're bound to find some part of the movie that appeals to your sense of humor.Plus there's a giant crocodile. What could be better?"
4,"Funny, entertaining, and great special effects!","What I hate about most movie reviewers is that they are too serious. Take Roger Ebert's review of Lake Placid, for instance. (If you haven't read it, find it on the net somewhere.) People need to just sit back, relax, and enjoy. Lake Placid is everything a good-natured, semi-spoof, creature feature should be. Key words: semi-spoof. THAT'S why LP isn't scary. The script works, the acting is brilliant, the soundtrack is great, and above all the special effects are jaw dropping. Oh, and the one-liners and fellow character bashings are hillarious. So dig in...and enjoy."
2,Wait until this one is 50 years old before seeing it,"This is a B movie, reminiscent of those black and white '50s flicks where a giant octopus sprawled all over the Embarcadaro in San Francisco, a huge praying mantis crawled up the Empire State Building, or gigantic ants spewed out of the Los Angeles sewer system. This flick has a gigantic crocodile in a Maine lake. But unlike the recent ""Anaconda,"" this film has some good special effects, and at least is more entertaining than the pathetic ""Anaconda."" Maybe someday we'll look back on ""Lake Placid"" too with relish and nostalgic glee, but for now it is ... just ho-hum.But Betty White is worth watching this one for. She has two very funny lines in this sorry movie. And it was a bit of genius, casting her in the role which she plays. She's somewhat of an animal rights activist in real-life, I believe, and what she does in this movie, in hind-sight, is quite humorous."
2,This is one flaccid monster movie,"I saw Lake Placid opening night at the movie theater and was very, very disappointed. I was not expecting much, I mean it was from the director of Friday the 13th Parts 2 and 3. But the select scenes I had seen on television plugs got me over it and I went. Truth be told, Lake Placid is an excellent made for television movie, that is all. You can see where the commercial breaks would fit in, and Steve Miner lived down to his expectations, delivering a soulless commerical product of a movie. Bridget Fonda sleepwalks through a role that is clearly modeled after Ally McBeal and the humor runs the same shallow level. You want a great killer reptile movie, see Alligator, its place as the greatest one ever made is assured."
2,Terribly Uneven!,"This film tries to be suspenseful, especially in the beginning sequence, but never gives you one good scare or makes your adrenaline rush. The performances are nothing out of the ordinary, Bridget Fonda has some funny dialogue, but at times it is badly-written forced humor. Some plot elements are added to the film only to make it longer and more interesting (since they only started with the idea of a crocodile in Maine) but it makes the movie ridiculous and campy. Examples of those plot elements are the hostile old lady and the eccentricity of Oliver Platt's character. The ending lacks intensity. Could of been a cult hit or a campy experience but it never gets anywhere. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 4!"
3,Mindless fun,"Take away the beginning and end credits and what you are left with is a 75-minute long movie that you'll never watch more than once if you buy the DVD (like me) but will still have a fun time watching. Steve Miner returns to the tranquil lakeside settings he captured so well in the Friday the 13th movies and gives us more horror hokum.What I liked about Lake Placid is that it is kind of light-hearted and doesn't try and make itself a full-blown horror by showing us guts and entrails. The movie is NOT serious and has many suspenseful scenes packed into it's VERY brief running time. The cast are delightful and the big nasty croc is actually quite sympathetic at the end. Buy this DVD and enjoy for what it is...a light, breezy comedy-thriller that nails the bullseye instead of aiming for higher (and ultimately lesser) results."
5,That's One BIG CROC!,"Lake Placid was great, it is alot like Jaws only they got all of the facts right. I mean they never screwed up, crocodiles really can get that big, but the one thing that stumped me was how an Asianic crocodile could be found in Maine. My favorite part of the movie is when the croc takes out a GRIZZLY BEAR in like 5 seconds it was really cool. Also don't let the R of this movie scare you its really the language - not the gore . A great movie overall"
4,A funny horror show,"A silly plot that is pulled off by a great cast of characters. Chills and thrills, mixed with the perfect dose of comedy. It's a movie you will want to add to your soon-to-be-classic collection."
3,was expecting more deaths,"I was expecting to see a classic monster movie, full of wit, good special effects, and a very high body count. Only two of my three expectations were met..the dialogue is pretty good and actually carries the movie along; it does not slow the movie down. there are also several comedic scenes, such as the sheriff being caught by his own trap. the crocodile effects are very well done, using a mixture of animatronics and computer animation.but... my one big complaint with this movie. I wanted more people to become crocodile food. a bear here, a cow there, that does not count. you cannot have only a body count of two (at least on screen) people in a movie about a giant croc.this movie should be placed under 'comedy' at the local video store. deep blue sea was a much more satisfying monster movie that came out around the same time."
3,This is not scary,If you are looking for a scary movie do not pick this one if you are looking for a comidy pick this one. I know I know you are saying how can a scary movie be funny. well a lot of things are funny like when The woman says I am rutting for the crocidile. Or when they feed him the cow to try to bring him not that par but when he is strapped in to the strapy thing on the hellicopter and swinging from it. This is a must see movie.
1,Complete Trash,"Boring,Bad dialogue and the worst Special Effects in this type up movie. Fonda is complete annoying and is useless all she ever does is fall out of canoes and boats and that stupid crocodile it was so FAKE. Jaws made the shark look real but this it was complete awful. There was only one thing I like and that was Betty Whites performance and that was that great. I recommand ""Deep Blue Sea"" over this any day and that was bad as well.Lake Placid D- Deep Blue Sea C+"
1,I would have rather watched a pauly shore movie,"this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen. i was expecting a good blood and gore movie. but i get this crap about betty white taking care of a big aligator. dont waste your time with this movie unless you want a good laugh or you are in the mood to throw up. the best part was the credits. the movie would have been better if bill pullman was eaten. Ooh and if you have seen the movie already, they better not make a sequel. because the end hints to one. and that will be the day that hollywood will not be able to sink any lower"
1,Go the crock!,"Go the Crock! By that I mean I wish the crock had eaten David E. Kelly before he had had the chance to write this rubbish. Or better still, before he created Ally McCrap. The big question to ask about this film is why? Why was it made? Even more pertinent, what was the point? I love films like Alligator, Razorback, Grizzly, Piranha, but this film was just a shocker, in which I mean, it was bad. B.A.D. And that final shot! God almighty, how many times? I saw this film on a double bill with Deep Blue Sea and it made Mr Harlin' factory fed turkey seem fairly appetizing. Instead of the lame and boring ending that this (can I call it a film?) offered, I would have liked to have seen Calista Flockhart do a guest appearance as Ally, do her poxy pucker and end up as the crock's first big mac. Or skinny mac to be precise. Now that would have been worth the rental. Only redeeming features: Bridget Fonda and good effects. <...>"
1,What an Imperturbable 'Lake',"This is movie is one of the worst. Even the cover of the movie is a rip off of ""Jaws."" This movie is not funny, but extremely annoying. ""Lake Placid"" could've been so much better. That huge crocodile should've taken care of that senile woman by the lake. All of the characters are acrimon-ious, all deserving of a 'biting' surprise from the mutated creature. But no, the people who hardly have any lines get it, crunchy style. One of the worst movies ever. Now, I'm done."
2,Watch It on TV,"Watch this at least once, just to hear Betty white cursing like an old salt. Then watch Hard Rain to see her as a crazy old broad out to kill looters. Then burn both films.Let's be serious here. The psuedo-religious crocodile worshiping stuff by Oliver Platt was not needed. The idea of a crocodile living as far north as Maine is utterly laughable (damn, if they'd set it in SC or NC, I MIGHT have been able to suspend my disbelief)and the strategies used to catch it are even worse (dangle a live cow from a helicopter anyone?). Have the people involved with this film EVER seen Reptile Wild or any other program on National Geographic?"
3,An Adventure Story,"Jack and Annie find a magic tree house in their backyard and it takes them back to China. There, a powerful Dragon King appeared and tried to get them, but Jack and Annie hopped in a cart and if you want to know what happened, READ THIS BOOK!"
2,It's an Okay Book,It has a lot of interesting stuff about China. It's kind of boring. It might not be boring to other people who read it but I am giving it two stars because it's not that interesting to me!
4,A pretty good Magic Tree House book,"This book is where Jack and Annie go back to Japan where they meet the first king, the Dragon-King. A lot of people are worried because the Dragon-King is going to burn all the books that he finds. It's kind of scary, but mostly action-packed when Jack and Annie try to save the books. I highly reccomend this book to all fans, wether your a big fan or not."
3,Not too scary,I like that in every Magic Treehouse book you meet some good and some bad people. This book is not as scary as some Magic Treehouse books. There's only two scary parts. I think that the author doesn't tell you everything about the characters that Jack and Annie leave behind. It leaves a sort of happy surprise at the end.
4,A third grader's opinion,"Jack and Annie go to China in the magic treehouse to get a book for Morgan. When they got there, they met a boy that wanted them to deliver a message. They delivered the message to a girl and she gave them silk. They snuck into a wagon that pulled them to the Great Wall of China. They met a scholar that helped lead them to the book they were trying to find. They got the book, but the Dragon King saw them and sent people to catch Jack and Annie. They got lost in a temple trying to run from the people. They used the silk from the girl to find their way out. The gates began to close while they were leaving the temple, but then opened when they needed out. Jack and Annie saw the girl and boy they met together in a field as they were leaving in the treehouse. They got the book they were after."
5,Inspired My Niece to Learn About China,"Mary Osborne has done it again with a story that takes Jack and Annie into ancient China. They must save one of the books from the Emperor's bonfires. This book inspired my niece to learn more about China after she was through reading it. This book is great for children from ages 7 to 12. it. It's easy to read, the story is captivating and it tells so much about history. A perfect addition to the child's bookcase."
4,Its OK,I kind of liked this book but i read it in 3rd grade. My mom said i should read bigger books so i think its for younger kids not third and forth graders. They are great chidren fantisy book and so are the other books in the series. They keept my attention for a long time.
2,Great book,It's a good book it's not bad at all more people should buy this my cousin read this and loved it.
4,"ancient Chinese history, you can learn.","This time, Jack and Annie traveled to China 2000 years ago.They try to save a book was fired by Dragon King.In the travel, they met a silk weaver lady and a scholar.Finally, they got a bamboo book before burned.A bamboo book said tale story about the legend of Chinese, silk weaver and the cowherd.I can learn about ancient Chinese history and tale story."
3,CAN YOU SAY LONG--LONG--LONG???,"WOW!! WHAT AN ENDEAVOR--EVERY BIT OF THE 700+ PAGES WAS WORK.NOT ALL OF IT WAS BAD WORK--JUST WORK---NOT, NOT, NOT A QUICK READ.THAT SAID---THE BOOK WAS VERY, VERY GOOD. IT KEPT YOUR INTEREST ALL OF THE WAY THROUGH.WHEN THERE WAS ACTION---IT WAS GG RRR EEEE AAA TTTT ACTION---THE THERE WERETIMES THAT IT GOT TO WORDY FOR ME. AANNNDDD THE AUTHOR HAD THIS HABIT OFKEEPING REMINDING ME OF----WHO THE BAD GUY HAS KILLED----WHO WAS AT A MEETINGAND THEIR TITLE / RANKING---THIS TENDED TO GET ON MY NERVES.MY BIGGEST COMPLAINT IS / WAS THE WHOLE SEX THINGBETWEEN JOHN/NICHOLAS AND CLEMENTINE--IT WAS NOT NEEDEDIN THE BOOK--OR---IT COULD HAVE BEEN TONED DOWN AND STILLBEEN EFFECTIVE TO GET THE POINT ACROSS. LUCKILY, IT ONLYGOES ON FOR ~~40 PAGES OR SO.STLL---ALL-IN-ALL---A PRETTY GOOD BOOK."
3,3 1/2 stars,"Certainly, I got a whole lot of story for my money. For the most part, I enjoyed the ride and consistently wanted to continue reading to find out what would happen next. I loved the characters, John Barron and Kovalenko.I didn't understand why Allan Folsom felt the need to summarize the obvious every few chapters, but then gave no explanation or summary where and when it was truly needed."
2,Action,"The action doesn't stop, but reality never gets started. The characters are TV grade and as the plot gets more absurd the pleasure goes away, and the effort to finish the book increases."
2,Badly Needs Editing,"Mr, Folsom can certainly write a sentence and string them into interesting paragraphs. So can any competent English major. I padded through 400 of the 700+ pages before deciding it was too dirty and implausible to continue further. Moreover, because of his Clintonian descriptions of sex I will not pass this on to my wife and certainly not my adult daughters. I cannot in good conscience donate it to the library and must throw it to the shredder. Needless to add that I will not by purchasing any more of Mr. Folsom's books in the future."
3,"Starts great, boggs down","I've read all of Folsom's books and I have enjoyed them immensely. His latest however is not up to snuff. It starts out great with non stop action. It is kind of like the TV show 24; great action as long as you are willing to suspend your belief in reality and are just there for the ride. But then the book slows down like a car crash. The author goes off on tangents that have no relevance to the story. The plot is so weak that there are no surprises or true suspense after the fist 200 pages. At the end you are like a marathon runner just wanting to finish. The author could have done away with a lot of unnecessary detail and in so doing cutting the size of the book from 700 to maybe 350 pages. He could have thrown in a few twists and maybe developed the characters a little better. He is a very talented writer, but this where a good editor should have stepped in and done his job."
1,ridiculous,"this book was not only 300 pages too long, the plot was ridulous. i kept reading it until the last 75 pages thinking it had to get to the end, but it never does. i gave up. the scenes of alexander/raymond dying/ not dying, john/nicholas dying/not dying were too much. the drive to davos in the storm with the russian detective and the car going almost over the cliff was typical of folsom adding pages that were not needed."
2,Boorrring,"This book is poorly written, predictable, and, in general, a very weak story. I finish everything, and found myself only stayed up late in order to get this overwith. Do not bother."
3,Strong Start Weak Finish,THis was an exhausting book to read. It had a great start as others have said and then bogged down. It could almost be two seperate books. The links between the first and the second are thin at best and maybe the author thinks people forgot. In addition there is too much detail such as plane trips and airport trips that go no where. A great read if it was only 400 pages a so so read at 600
2,Great Beginning But the Rest Is Never Ending.,"I have read many of the customer reviews and they seemed to be split. I unfortunately agree with the negative reviews. The first segment of the book is wonderful. Without giving away any plot the train ride and the scenes in LA are riveting. If the book had ended there I would have given it a 5 star.The remaining portion of the epic is not convincing, wordy and boring at times. I continued to read this portion because of the momentum of the first portion. Also it was interesting to try to figure out exactly what was happening. This was resolved mid way through the second portion. From about 450 onwards the story dragged. I found the end unsatisfying.The question that is touched on better never really explored is the moral dilema that was faced. In the 700 pages more should have spent on this issue and less driving in a never ending snow storm."
1,Started out so good...,"I know I'm reading this 9 years late but I'm a patron of thrift stores. Anyway, I read the cop/train part and was excited. I then glanced at the contents again, Los Angeles, Europe, Russia? I had to read the last few pages. OMG! What a messed up ending. I then decided to take my page marker from chapter 20 and tossed the book. No thanks."
1,Paid by the word?,"I am forcing myself to slog through to the end of the book. Having invested so much time so far, I can't just bring myself to cut my losses now, when I can finally see the end. I agree with another reviewer here who talked about the need for a good editor -- I would say an editor with a SHARP pair of scissors. Cut out about half the words and get things MOVING, and this would have been a decent read."
4,Too much of a good thing,"There is no point of relating the story of The Exile which many have already done. What I found was a really good read - I simply could not put the book down, but like a chef who keeps adding ingredients to the dish, it ends by being too much. Less would have been more. There are also unbelievable aspects which one has to overlook (Rebecca speaking five languages fluently in five months - please!) and there were several subplots unnecessary to the story (Marten's capture by the unknown interrogators for one), several holes in the plot, and the last, brief page is an unsatisfying wrong note. But you will enjoy this book nevertheless."
2,Much anticipated but ultimately dissapointed,"Having read the first two novels in one sweeping breathtake, I found myself again having a sleepless night going on to the rollercoasterride I anticipated. How disappointing that after the first 200 (very readable) pages the novel stalls becoming more and more predictable and I am very sorry to say this, by times utterly stupid. I'm prepared to wait another few years to give Folsom another go, but after having read the last line I was really disappointed."
3,"Nothing like ""The Exile.""","Publishers Weekly hit it on the head. The first 200 pages were great.Folsom has a great nack of plotting and great dialogue. It is over-longat 701 pages and besides being a book and a half the sequel isobviously in the works. The plotting is so exuberant and not reallybelievable. Even suspending belief I simply could not wade throughthe almost sci-fiction swings of plot and simply went to the last twochapters and moved on to another book. Not in the same league as""The Day After Tomorrow."""
4,Long but Entertaining,"John and Raymond get after one another from the git go. Suspenseful, entertaining, breathtaking. This book has it all. Ranks right up there with The Day After Tomorrow.The only reason I failed to give it a ""5"" is that there are several incidents that are just not plausible.Then again,the ending will knock your socks off.A bad LAPD group, A bad Russian, A good Russian, and a sister who blossoms;albeit hard to believe.Worth your time to read. Enjoy"
4,"Big Book, Fun Ride","This book is a lot of fun. From page one, you are taken on a wild ride as LAPD Det. John Barron hunts down the elusive and secretive killer, Raymond Thorne.The story is epic in nature, and by the time you finish, you really feel like you have been on an adventure yourself.There are lots of secrets to learn, and lots of twists and turns and hidden identities. If you have ever read Folsom before, then you know how entertaining he can be.On the negative side, the characters are stereotypical though entertaining, and at times I felt like I was reading a screenplay more than a book. (And this would make a terrific movie.)On the plus side, this book ends with a stunning last page...but you can't cheat and have to read the entire book to appreciate it. It's that good.Recommended."
5,Handel Ariodante Hunt Gondek Saffer Lane Muller Cavalier Freiburg McGegan,"Handel Ariodante Hunt Gondek Saffer Lane Muller Cavalier Freiburg McGegan is a very fine recorind with under the direction of the accomplished conductor Nicholas McGegan. Freiburger Barochorchester certainly know how to play Handel and the result is nothing short of splendid. The singers for this production is truly astounding and vocalists like for instance Lorraine Hunt truly is treat to hear. Harmoni mundi have done a great job with booklet; it contains many fine photographs, a very-well written essay on the opera itself by Mark W. Stahura, and a short synopsis by Frank Hammond. This recording I give 5 out of 5 stars."
5,One of the best Bossa Nova albums in a long time,"I had never heard of Dusko Goykovich until I heard a track from this album on a jazz radio station on the internet. So I searched out this album. What an album. The entire album is a great listen from start to finish. Goykovich and his ensemble are masters of weaving a bossa nova sound that is milky smooth and so nuanced that their musical experience and maturity is evident. This is not a ""smooth jazz"" or ""pop jazz"" album, its not a modern take on the bossa beat by young hipsters. This album is a warm Brazilian blanket that I love to wear frequently."
4,Handy,it is okay. it serves the purpose for which it is meant for. I shall buy again if the need arises.
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...],"The Beach should have been called The Cute Guy From Titanic Takes His Cloths Off. ""Leo"" got a very big following after being in the then best grossing film of all time, Titanic. It was an amazing film and he did a great job, but unfortunately for us horny Americans, there wasn't enough skin. That's where The Beach comes in. This was a rush job plain and simple. The movie has no flow or plot, it's big sell was Leo DiCaprio on The Beach wearing very little. Honestly he should have just done a magazine shoot and saved us the time, because this movie isn't worth the film it is shot on. Unless you want to see lots of Leo with his shirt off, this movie is a definite pass."
2,Zand Quick Cleanse,"I didn't enjoy this cleanse system too much. It made me have diarrhea, like explosive diarrhea, and was not ideal for someone who has to work and work often. Because the system is seven days long, you have to keep doing it to have any results. I don't think I would ever buy this again. I've had better luck with other products."
5,Chadwick,"It was a great book with lots of information. The illustrations were supurb and it was well written. The text was easy to understand and it would make a great ""Coffee Table Book"" as well as a great reference and an asset to any Christian's library..."
2,fair at best,"It is surprising that a supposed history book, written by a university professor includes not a single reference. The author makes many assertions as fact but fails to provide historic documentation for any of them. This lack undermines any veracity the author may have otherwise enjoyed. I cannot imagine having submitted a paper in college without properly done citations; It would have been returned ungraded at best, more likely as a fail"
4,"very funny, intimate portrait of 2 weirdos","This documentary is a look at how the other half lives, or at least how 2 weird freakin' dudes live. It makes you feel good about yourself and your life and is quite amusing to boot. I highly recommend checking it out."
1,almost suckered,"I thought i found a deal, but just like anything that sounds or looks to good to be true so was this deal. I almost ordered what i read in the description was a pump actually turned out to be a filter. The add clearly states pump but deceptively sells you a filter. Scam, bait and switch. Be careful with this seller. I'm glad i read the reviews prior to ordering."
5,Nice paper towel holder,"We are happy with the quality and function of this paper towel holder. It adds a unique touch to our kitchen, too."
5,Conway Twitty Sings Elvis Presley Favroites,"I have aways thought Conway sounded a lot like Elvis. When Conway released ""It's Only Make Believe"" in the latter 50's, and being an extreme Elvis fan, I had to get my copy (a 45 record) thinking that this might be E using a different form and maybe E might be having problems with RCA. When I saw this CD avabile, I just had to get it. And after receiving this CD, it brought back so many early memorys, Conway does an excellent job on the recordings, I'm sooo glad I purchased this CD."
3,Conway...,"When I was a kid in the seventies I thought every singer sounded like Conway and Elvis. I loved there music so when i found this cd I was happy, I've always been a fan of tributes from great artist to great artist. although I'll always favor Elvis doing Elvis and conway doing conway, it was nice to hear conway do something positive about Elvis. his ""who did they think he was"" kinda made it seem like Conway was a little jealous of all the attention and fame the fans gave Elvis. well he deserved it. as did conway for his musical input as well. enjoy the cd."
3,Cutting up the 90's,"Big Daddy is a 50's and 60's retro group who interpret songs from the 80's and 90's as if they were recorded a few decades earlier. Imagine Little Richard, Elvis, Ricky Nelson, Chuck Berry and Jackie Wilson singing songs made famous by Bruce Springsteen, Prince, U2, Madonna and Dire Straits. The effect is enjoyable, interesting and humorous, but doesn't bear listening to very often. If you are a listener who loves both 50's and 80's music, you will enjoy playing ""Cutting Their Own Groove"" for your friends. The songs benefit from the re-interpretation, and you will never again hear the originals without thinking of Big Daddy.The group also recorded the entire ""Sgt. Pepper"" album in the same manner."
3,Very Informative,"When I bought this book, I was expecting to be the stories of various cannibal killers throughout history. Indeed the book does cover, in pretty good detail, about 5 or 6 cannibal killers. However, the book also spends several chapters talking about the psychology behind cannibal and serial killers.The various stories of the killers were chilling and a must read. The psychological portion of the book is a little ""dry"" to read, but explains a lot about cannibal and serial killers."
4,"Very solid overview, well written","This book is a well written, even wryly humorous at times, account of some of history's notorious cannibal killers. It describes all one would want to know about the individuals portrayed, and it ends with some summary information about what is known or theorized about cannibal killers as a species, so to speak. I recommend it to anyone with the stomach to inquire into this disturbing stuff, who is interested in an interesting and very readable overview of the subject."
3,Its OK,This is just an OK soundtrack. I only like 2 tracks plus the rousing vocal finale of Cast A Giant Shadow sing in Hebrew. Tracks 2 and 10 were my favorites.
5,Please correct playing time,"This is not a review, but please correct the playing time. Description now states ""Listening Length: 5 hour(s) and 31 min."" -- which can't be true of an unabridged reading of this long novel. It should be about the same length as Phineas Redux, which is 23 hrs and 41 mins in length.Thanks"
4,Who's the Man,"It's a comedy who done it, featuring alot of the old school hip-hop artists. After seeing the movie on BET recently it brought back all of the good memories relating to the actors and the musicians and I went searching to buy a copy."
2,borderline,"i didnt think the film was as funny as it made out to be.Both actors were trying their best to be as stupid as they could to little avail.there were some funny points though,but overall;average film, below average acting"
5,HILARIOUS!!!,"This movie is so funny, i was literally hurting from laughing so much the first time i saw it. my personal favorite part is when the House of Pain shows up in the movie playing poker with Colin Quinn. I honestly think they should've gotten a bigger part in the movie. Denis Leary is outrageously hilarious. Every scene he is in is a guaranteed laugh riot. but then again, when is Denis Leary NOT funny?"
3,"""Who's The Man?"" Review","Cashing in on their popularity at the time as hosts of ""Yo! MTV Raps"", Doctor Dre and Ed Lover play two mediocre Harlem barbers who decide to become police officers. When their best friend is murdered by a crooked land developer, they make it their point to find out what's really behind all the problems in the neighborhood. ""Who's The Man?"" will never be regarded as a cinematic masterpiece but it does get the most out of its two stars as well as the countless performers who make cameos (most of them are late 80's rap icons). Denis Leary, in particular, steals the show as a short-tempered superior officer whose profanity-laced tirades make for some first-rate entertainment. While this movie borrows quite a bit from other films (most noticeably ""Beverly Hills Cop""), it never tries to take itself too seriously. The chemistry between Dre and Lover is solid and the wild over-the-top characters make for some amusing moments. If nothing else, it's worthy of ""cult"" status."
3,A little simplistic...,"I did like this book, and I could see reccommending it to clients I counsel. The activities and exercises are great. Her writing style is easy to read and the book is well laid out. She covers pretty much all the important issues with a fair amount of detail and great examples.So why the relatively low rating? Well, I did find the book oversimplified the problems of unassertiveness. I would've liked an entire chapter just on the role of women in society and how that influences our potential unassertiveness. She just didn't go deeply enough for my liking as to the causes of unassertiveness. For a person with real, long term problems speaking up for themselves this book wouldn't be enough either. I had a real issue with the way the author seemed to suggest that all you had to do was read the book and follow her program and you could become assertive. For many it isn't that easy."
4,Los Panchos,"Not very high quality but I guess this is to be expected, but I thoroughly enjoyed listening to their wonderful music. They were the best. Their lead singer just passed away at the ripe old age of 93 in California. I will love their music the rest of my life."
5,Wrestlemania 19,This was a great Wrestlemaiania!Best macth: Street Fight: Hulk Hogan vs. Mr.MacMahon/Steve vs. the RockWorst Match: Triple threat tag team title match
3,Wrestlemania XIX Good PPV,"This was a solid event in my view, but I don't think it measures up to the last two Wrestlemanias. Something was just lacking. The lineup looked very promising on paper, and while all of the matches were solid, nothing spectacular went down and the matches ranged from average to very good, but no serious stand outs resulted from the card like in previous years. However, this is maybe the best PPV the WWE has put since Summerslam of last year. Some of the highlights include the opening match, Taker's Wrestlemania streak on the line, a well-wrestled women's match, Shawn Michaels putting on another show, Booker T showing why he, and not Trips, should be holding the Heavyweight Title, the surprisingly entertaining Hogan-Vince fight, Rock and Austin 3, and the satisfying WWE Championship bout between Brock and Angle. While not great, still a decent event that should reassure hardcore fans that WWE still can put on a spectacle."
5,Best Ever WWE Video,This is the best WWE video I have ever watched and I just love the Rock I think if you want yo see a WWE video watch this one.From Fan Reece Baruch
2,Not a Good WrestleMania,"I personally feel that this is a disappointing DVD. The show itself features only two matches that are worth going out of your way to see, Jericho/HBK and Brock/Angle. Rock/Austin wasn't bad, but its been done better twice, and Vince/Hogan was bad, unless you are into the ""20 Years In the Making"" deal.The extras are not worth seeing, since must of them are from other WWE shows like Confidential. So, I give this show a thumbs down."

5,Brings back memorys,great dvd i watched wrestlemania 19 when it happened on march 30th 2003 it was as great now as it was then kurt angle vs brock lesnar? jericho vs shawn? greatness!!!
4,another good wrestlemania,I won't go through all the matches but once again Wrestlemania lived up to the hype. Hogan and Vince of course was just a classic match. Shocking ending(to us old school fans anyway) Brock and Kurt was good of course. Rock and Austin was good but not as good as their previous wrestlemanias. I would have given this 5 stars but they left out rvd and kane tag match. You mean to tell me they left these guys who worked their butts off to please us fans off the show and they put miller light girls instead. They were goofy and boring. That was the only downfall of the ppv in my opinion. Unless you like eye candy of course. So other than that it was a strong show. You get two performances by limp bizkit so that's cool. The extras are very good as well. This is a must for any wrestling fan
5,canada drools usa rules,best matches wereundertaker vs big & and a-train*****the rock vs stone cold steve austin*****wwe championshipbrock lesnar vs kurt angle*****worst matches wereshawn michaels vs chris jericho*
3,An Okay Wrestlemania,"This show was definitely better than what I expected. If you look at all the other ppvs so far this year, Wrestlemania 19 is by far the best. But in comparison to other ppvs in recent years, it falls short. This is arguably the greatest ppv of the year, but not the greatest Wrestlemania of all time. I loved the main event with Angle and Lesnar because it was nice to see guys in that slot other than Austin, Rock, Undertaker or Triple H who always seem to be there. And credit to McMahon and Hogan for putting on an awesome street fight although I think those guys should have retired long ago. On the flip side, Matt Hardy and Rey Rey only given 5 minutes for their match? Oh well. Watch this Wrestlemania for its overall quality."
3,ho hum,"rvd and kane vs lance storm and val venis.if it wasnt for rvd this one totaly suck.then ray jr annhilates matt hardy.booooooooo!a very quick half assed match between giant and a-train battling taker and nathan jones.a real snoozer!then a 3 way with some chicks.one of the best matches yet!then to pick up your spirits theres a cool 3 way tag match.2 guierros vs team angle vs benoit and rhino.a phenominal match!y2j vs hbk.it was suprisingly alright.booker t vs triple h.uh oh im back asleep again.that was all about the biggest hand out recipient from wcw vs the biggest one with wwe.hulk hogan vs vince mcmahon.this match was awesome!vince put on quite a show!i was thoroughly impressed!the rock fought austin..........again.nothing happening here.then an awesome match between kurt angle and brock lesnar.while it was a really good match,the build up from the net and the magazines and the fans couldnt be lived up to."
3,Good WrestleMania. Great stuff on the DVD,"I thought WrestleMania 19 was pretty good but some of the matches were dull and not that great.The best matches were VINCE VS.HOGAN,KURT VS.BROCK,ROCK VS.AUSTIN and a few others.I'd reccomend this WrestleMania to anyone especially the DVD cuz it has tons of great extras on it.In my opinion i'd say WrestleMania X8 was much better than WrestleMania 19 but X9 was still a good WrestleMania but i still think it didnt top WMX8."
5,A Great Singer!,"""What I Did For Love"" was my first Jack Jones album and I instantly become an ardent fan. Jack has the sophistication of a cabaret singer and a mass appeal of a rock star during his heydays (Loveboat was a big hit then. I don't know if the TV series made it big or the song was instrumental in the series' success). And what usually happens when you find something good is look for another. And that's how I came to have that album with only one tract - ""She"" - that I am familiar with. It did take me sometime to really like the songs and there lies the magic of song discovery! That's the process where for unknown reason, one basically discovers the beauty of the melody, the elegance of the lyrics and not only that I came to know who Charles Aznavour is, who actually composed all the songs.Although his earlier Kapp recordings are excellent compared to his more recent releases, this Aznavour songbook is simply his best."
4,"Classic Blondy Vibe, New Millennium Style","This two-disc set kept me groovin' all afternoon. It's an excellent collection of tracks done live, alpha-millennium style, with nary a dud in the bunch."
3,Okay for short trips,"Not sure if is becuase I am not using the product correctly or if it is just the product. It is good for short trips but when I flew from Jacksonville to Vegas by the time I got to Vegas (straight flight) it did not seem very cold. The beads were still activated but, my medication was not cold it was lukewarm at best."
5,Great toy,The toy looks fun and I'm sure my Conure will love it. I ordered a small and when I opened my packaged I realized how small it really is. I wish I had ordered the medium sized toy :C Its hard to tell what size these things really are from a picture.
3,Don't care for the taste,"It's not that the product tastes bad, it just doesn't appeal to me. Be careful of where you buy this product. The product I purchased from the Amazon web site clumped. I believe it is old.Previously, I bought peach flavored from the Herbasway and like it. I also like how I can carry it with me everywhere I go and just add it to my water. I have since bought more peach (from Herbasway) and will continue to use the product. Cheaper than soda and good for you."
5,Singing away!,"Once again I've found the music book I needed on Amazon. This is an adorable songbook for PK, K or 1st. Really glad I found it again! Very happy I purchased it!"
1,AC Adapter,Beware this product does not charge the battery. In fact one has to remove the battery to use the AC power. I purchased the adapter so I could charge the battery without having to remove it from the camera. Limited use.
5,A good hard read.,"It's a rare book that can make you forgive a man who is committing unforgivable acts. For that reason I want to call this book the American Lolita. I know that Lolita is set in America, but it has a distinctly European sensibility, and Blue Calhoun's sensibility is purely American. Thematically, both books deal with the sexualization of girls and how that echoes through families and lives. But this book is not especially explicit. Blue is too careful with words to go there. It is a piningly romantic, erotically charged and heartbreaking story. It's on a par with Kate Vaiden, my other beloved Price book. Both books share a perfectly evoked time and place and a realistic way with Southern dialog, in that people talk over and around the real subject, maintaining their manners during emotionally charged exchanges. That delicacy keeps this book from ever dipping into the sordid, even as it deals with difficult subject matter."
2,If I knew then what I know now,"I do intend to read all of Price's books, if this had been the first I read I probably would have re-read a Confederacy of Dunces immediately to get the horrid pictures out of my head. This was not a necessary book for publication - though it may have been edifying to write. Price was a magnificent talent and individual but this book does not give testament to that. If you liked Bastard Out of Carolina, this would be the next in line."
3,"Good, but aint no Kate Vaiden","I loved both Roxanna Slade and Kate Vaiden written by Reynolds Price, and was excited to find this book. I thought it was drawn out in parts, predictable in others, but generally OK. All of his characters are either losers or long-suffering, which in this particular story, I found repeatedly tiring, as in enough already! Maybe if I had read it at another time.."
3,Good book but could have been better,"My friend bought SCWCD Exam study kit from manning and I bought this one. I liked the book overall but one thing that I expected was more number of test in their exam simulator. I thought it has 3 tests (I don't know where I got that one, may be because SCWCD exam study kit has 3) but it has only 1. They should state that clearly someplace. The notes at the end of each chapter are not as thorough as the manning book.The writing style is good and the information content is good too. You need to have some exposure to JSP/Servlets to follow the book, though. Overall, it is definitely buyable."
4,I only wish Dido were on here,"Rollo Armstrong, Dido Armstrong's brother, has created a wonderful album full of amazing concepts, beats and soulful vocals (when there are some). i only wish Dido could have appeared on this album to make it truly wonderful. i think i would put Rollo (aka Dusted) in the catagories with the wonderful hypnotic sounds of Sigur Ros or Godspeed you Black Emeperor! even though there is a definite sound difference. This album may seem expensive because it is an import, but i think that you will be fairly surprised with the depth and easy-listening capabilities of this album"
5,When are we getting it on DVD?,Life is full of priorities. This movie has got to move higher up the list of things to do - make it available to the world in 2000!
1,"Great movie, dumb dvd","I read the review where someone said this movie is full frame, so I referenced this movie on dvdplanet.com. Sure enough, it says it's full frame!! Unforgiveable !! I think this is 1 of the best movies ever. Who is the bird brained gremmie responsible for sabotaging this dvd ? Grrrrrrr. I was going to buy this dvd, but now I will just record from my ES II laserdisc onto a dvd."
4,Classic movie needs better DVD treatment,"This movie is an all-time favorite of the family, but the DVD version could be much better with these improvements: Video--Needs widescreen and a less grainy transfer, Audio--Needs 5.1 digital remastering, Extras--haven't viewed yet. However, this is an awesome movie that should be seen by all--5 stars for the movie and 3 for the DVD."
2,Widescreen??????,"Bruddahs an sistas!!! Wher da Widescreen!!! Dis movie is one of my top tree favorite surf films, I gav da VHS widescreen 5 stars, but bra, da guys at da Monterray film place must be lolo!!! where is da DVD Widescreen?????"
4,Pretty good,"This is a great surf movie and has lots of supreme footage. I especially enjoyed the footage taken in the water; it makes you feel like you are right in the waves with them! I would warn everyone that there is a scene at a nude beach in France, which is something I definitely didn't expect when I bought it, seeing that it was rated PG."
5,Stoked everytime I push play,"It just doesn't get any better. The surf, the locations, and the music. Now If I can just get my hands on a DVD version. Every surfer should have a copy of Endless Summer 2. It will take you a away and put you in a better place all while sitting in your favorite recliner. I don't care if it's a cold and gray day in January, you will want to go surfing so bad after watching this movie or atleast go wax your board!Push play, grab a cold beer, and sit back and let Endless Summer 2 Take you away. Finally a way to dream again.Enjoy, Eddie"
5,"If you surf, you need to see this movie!","This was probably the best surf movie I have ever seen. I just loved watching them ride all kinds of waves all over the world. Truly entertaining, even for those who don't surf. I would recommend it to anyone at all."
3,Thoughtful but disorganized,"The message is all there in this book but finding it is a treasure hunt. There is some excellent advice, excellent exercises, and great information on how to progress. In order to put it together logically, I needed to create my own index and map to the information."
1,disappointing,"very disappointing book. The writing is poor, the book is disorganized, and consists primarily of repetitive statements about the author's philosophy on dressage. I wasn't able to read more than half the book before giving up in disgust."
4,Children without names,"A truly amazing story. It makes a person who is aware of their family background and lineage realize what it means not to have one, and that one's identity and heritage is too easily taken for granted. A good read of a untold part of our history. George J.I was awed by the courage and resilience of Mr. Snow. I was moved by this story and the impact it has had on many Canadians. Well worth a read. Liz J."
5,Shignle wonder bar,"This bar really works good on roof repairs, when you have to lift a couple of shingles and renail them back down. the bar will hold the nail on ether side of the bar so you don't have to hold the nail's with your hands and try to hold the shingle up at the same time. the bar works wonder full bought three of them for the crew."
3,Seems thick,"Never used this for repair because it seems very thick to accomplish the task. My shingles are very old, and I'm opting to replace the roof (a couple of them cracked when tried to use this tool). My slate appears to be economically laid back in 1920, so this may work for other slate roof setups. I've seen this tool much thinner from other sources, so more expensive and thinner stronger material may be what I needed in this case."
2,Not Good For Asphalt/Fiberglass Shingles,"I had to replace a roof vent, and needed to remove nails from the surrounding shingles. The name ""Shingle Ripper"" is accurate. I had better luck using a regular 18"" flat bar and a cat's paw nail puller. Maybe someone somewhere has a step-by-step for successfully using this tool on asphalt shingles? I looked and couldn't find one."
1,shingle ripper,I was looking for a inexpensive ripper that would cut roofing staples for individual cedar shake replacement. This is a slate ripper that removes the nails in slate roofs. It doesn't have a sharp carbide cutting edge on the hooks that I expected. It is also thicker than the more expensive slate rippers
2,Better than nothing,"This is the first time I've used one of these tools, so I'm not exactly sure how it's supposed to work.But, from what I understand, the tool is SUPPOSED to cut the nails.There is no way this tool could cut through anything. The hooked areas look like they're supposed to be sharp, but are far from it.When you hook a nail you have to beat on the tool with a heavy hammer to bend and rip the nail out of the wall.What I think it's supposed to do is just slice through the nail.Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think so.I give it more than one star simply because it IS better than nothing, even though I don't think it works correctly.I guess I can try to sharpen mine, but in all honesty I wish I had just spent the extra 20 - 30 bucks for a real one."
3,Anastasia,"I love the songs in there, the cute, romantic love story, and the interesting conversations. But the Rasputin-related parts are kind of nasty-scary. I mean bad person supposed to be scary, but this is a bit over necessary in most part. It's more as nasty than scary."
5,Fox has really out done themselfs !,"The history of the _Real __ Anastasia is just blah blah she dies a sad ending ,but this is way better Anastasia didn't have to be a certian age smarty pants I mean her being 8 years old sworda added a touch of class and the music just touched my heart Poka was sooooooo cute ! The end is not chessie i agreed with that boy \ girl who said that pepole who hate it should go to the mental hospital ! I mean Anya / Anastasia was jusst gorgeous and Dimrti was funny ! Pepole who like this movie I agree with you 1 ,2 and some 3 star pepole get a life ! Wake up 1,2 and some 3 star pepole wkae up this is the 90's it doesn't have to be like the history and disney movies are good like ,The little Mermaid,Lion King 2 , Lion king , Pochantoas,and 102 dalmatians are very good belive me they are it's just that I think Anastasia is top of the line . Bye"
4,A movie to last the years,A great movie for younger children all the way up to teen years. Daughter and father watched it together and both enjoyed it.
3,"Something for everyone, beautiful but rather predictable","There is beauty, action, and adventure, but no suspense or nostalgia.It features a combination of traditional and CG (computer model rendering) animations, we do not see this again untilSpirit: Stallion of Cimarron.There are moments for everyone, however the theme shifts from one moment to another, making it hard to hold everyone's attention.There are gory and creepy moments, and the ""west"" is portrayed as rather sinister (even by today's standards).All of the ""surprises"" seem choreographed like a ballet, so it''s a very mixed opinion for me. It has re-watch value, but not the whole story."
2,Good movie if you like complete fiction!!!,"This movie is not even close to the real story of Anastasia! It is very unlikely that Anastasia would have survived the REAL way she and her family were attacked, but I'm not going to tell you how because it's pretty grosome. I will tell you, however, that Rasputin did not do magic, No one actully stormed the castil, and Anasasia's grandmother was NOT there at the time! Plus, I watched this when I was a little girl, and I got scared to death! I gave this 2 stars because it is a good story(even if it is made up!)."
2,Giving the Wrong Infomation...,"This was, I have to admit, a cute movie... but that's it. It is mostly incorrect when it comes to historical facts. First of all, Demitri (the guy that ""Anastasia"" falls in love with) in real life was her cousin who lived in the palace with the family... ok, so now we're teaching kids that it's ok to date family members? Secondly, though Rasputin was a pretty shady guy, he was generally liked by the Romonof family because he helped relieve their son's, Alexis's, haemophilia. Well, those are just a few things that I can think of off the top of my head, but seroiusly, if you're going to make a historical film for kids, the least you can do is try to make it just a bit more correct."
2,Overall good movie,"The graphics and animation were really awesome and I liked the songs from the movie. My main disappointment was that it was not very accurate in history. For starters, the revolution didn't take place when Anastasia was eight but when she was seventeen. Anastasia died along with her family after being shot by Lenin and his followers."
3,Not the best movie.,"We wanted to see Anastasia, because my daughter skates for the song ""Once upon a December"".It is not a bad movie, but not a good one either. There are parts when my 7 and 5 years old kidswere scared. That kind of ruined the movie for me. These parts did not even added too much for thestory in my opinion. At other parts they were bored. They say there is a shortened version. I plan to check that out."
4,Loved the first not so much the second,"As a child I absolutely LOVED Anastasia, it was one of my favorite movies, and at 17 I still love it, especially Bartok, he's just so adorable! I'd give this five stars for the incredible value, and the great special features included in the Family Fun edition, but Bartok the Magnificent just wasn't the best, it wasn't completely horrible, but just not ""Magnificent""."
4,Good family flick,"Anastasia is the most overlooked ""princess"" of Disney. She is a great character and this is a really cute movie."
5,Journey to the past.........,I love this movie with all my heart. It's a timeless classic. The music is wondeful and and all of the actors are great ^^
4,Loved it!,"Really liked it! Great animation for Fox's first animated moved. I know is was not histricaly correct - but kept me and the kids happy. Cannot wait to see the next animation feature ""Titan A.E."" which the trailer was at the beginning of Star Wars."
3,The movie is fine.,"I love this movie, so that is why I decided to buy it. The only problem I had with the movie was when it was shipped to me, the entire case was destoryed. The movie itself was perfectly fine but the case was not. I am upset that the company shipped the movie in that condition since I bought the movie brand new."
5,This was the best!!,"I first got hooked on the movie by reading the book about the movie about a month before it came out. I would read that book everyday, watch t.v. for pure reason of seeing comercials. And when I saw the movie I fell in love with it. I would beg to see it. I know all the words to all songs. To this day it is the movie I LOVE!!! I watch almost every day. My favorite part is when Dimirti saves Anya on the boat. I wish that I could give the moive 10 stars. I have even heard the FOX may be making a sequel."
5,I just absolutely adored this video.,"This video was ordered by a friend of mine just a little while back and when she had brought it over for our feel and act like a kid weekend... well let me just say she and I both think it was in great condition when it got to her and it was also a very very good movie.The movie is funny, sad, happy and just all in all I would give it 5 stars."
4,Historically inaccurate but enjoyable,"Anastasia was completely inaccurate and I am one of the people that knows almost everything about the Romanovs. It was a very nice kids movie though, but if you know what really happened to Anastasia and here family and know the truth then it isn't as good."
5,The best cartoon movie in years!,"This is the best cartoon movie I had seen in years. This movie is everything in quality as Disney, and better! The computer rendered parts blended in with the cartoon animation was done beutifully, the soundtrack is amazing, and the voice acting is superb! I would recomend this to anyone who likes comedies, romances(Ick!), or adventure. If you are looking for a good cartoon movie, go get Anastasia, because it is better than any of the stuff that disney put out any day! This is just a great movie, if you have doubts about it, or think that it might be just some stupid kiddie cartoon, think again. I myself thought that, until I saw it for the first time. GO AND SEE THIS MOVIE!"
5,LOVE IT,"I loved this movie when I was younger, even had the little cardboard dolls of all the characters. Happy to have found it on dvd so now I can let my daughter grow up with it. Happy with it and the price."
4,Needs a re-edit,"One of the few movies made by the now non-existent Fox Animation Studios, this is their best attempt at creating a masterpiece. Many beautiful backdrops (i.e. the ballroom), wonderfully written songs, and a fantastic love story make this movie well worth watching.The acting could be much better, including both the voice acting, and the non-verbal expressions in the animation. My biggest critique of the movie though is the Ras Putin subplot. The real villain in this movie was deception, and it almost conquered the hearts of the protagonists. Without the little demon fairies, the evil sorcerer, this movie could have been amazing. A simple re-edit to exclude those elements would have made a much more memorable movie experience."
5,Best version yet!!,"This Blu-ray version has been remastered so the images are the crispest, most beautiful version yet! There are more special features than the DVD version as well. Great buy for a great price."
1,Horrible condition,Thus movie wouldnt even play.it was a liitle bent out of shape . My neice loved it on tv so i thought id buy it. WHat disappointment. So i went tovthe store and bought it!
5,good memory,"my kids and i were having a looking back moment and watched this movie.this was one of many favorite movies in our home.it was a great memory.thank you for making it available,now it will be my grandkids turn to watch."
5,love it,"This movie is a great classic, music, dancing, great story line. Recommend viewing for all ages any time. Grab the popcorn and a drink. Enjoy"
5,Anastasia (Follow-Along Edition),"The DVD work marvelously and no scratches. This shipped before hand and arrived extremely early!!! :)(I know that this is not your problem, but I am just wondering if you or someone tell me how to change the Product Detail, because I was so looking forward to listening to this in Russian as I watch this animation...)"
5,Anastasia,"Fantastic movie for all kids but especially for girls. Truly one of the best animated films made. For the first time that I can remember in a kid's movie, the girl is the HERO. Anastasia saves her ""love interest"" (and all of Paris) all by herself. Even my daughter said, ""Girls save boys. right Mommy?""And the music is stunningly beautiful. There should be more kid's films like this one."
4,Cute movie.,"This movie was cute, but Rasmussen was great for the adults, but more scary for the little ones. Imwould not recommend this for. timid children."
2,Scratched DVD,"Both discs are considerably scratched up, much more than I had expected, and freezes about 7 minutes in, so that the whole movie cannot be watched."
5,The Most Beautiful and Uplifting Movie I have Ever Seen!,"""Anastasia"" is the most Beautiful, Uplifting, and Meaningful movie I have ever seen! (It left me completely enchanted the first time I saw it in the theatre, and I ended up seeing it a total of 15 times while it was in the theatres because I LOVE it so much! Needless to say, I now own the video). The storyline of how the endearing characters find the true meaning of Home, Love, and Family brings a sense of inspiration and comfort to everybody who watches it, no matter what age you are. The songs are lovely, the backgrounds are breathtaking, and the content of the movie stunningly reflects joy for life, joy for finding out who you are, and joy for finding true love."
3,digital copy EXPIRED??!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Well I purchased the movie as a gift, I thought this item would be perfect considering it came with a digital copy; however the person I purchased this for called me telling me that the digital copy expired.... soo I basically spent those extra dollars for nothing, if I'd of known I could've just purchased the dvd and saved a few bucks.The retailer of this item should let people know this before purchasing, or take it off the site completely!!!!!!!!"
5,Anastasia,Who would have thought John Cusack and Meg Ryan were the voices. I wanted to update my collection from VHS to blue-ray and the price was just right.
5,great movie,I had thought the movie was no longer available and thanks to Amazon I managed to find a copy and in perfect condition
2,A doubtful movie.,"An unbalanced movie. Excellent score and story, good secondary characters, impressive but impersonal computer generated backgrounds, poor villain (including the white bat) and an antipathic heroine. The excessive use of computer generated textures gave an artificial look for the movie. A doubtful movie: it's a animated feature but looks like a full computer generated movie. After all, it's a good work, but no more than it. END"
1,doesn't play on a DVD player?,"I'm confused. This is the second disc I've tried (already returned one with the same problem) and it doesn't play on my DVD player. It works on my laptop, but not my Panasonic DVD player. any ideas??"
2,hmphf,"This is, easily, the worst animation flick i've seen (not counting Quest for Camelot). Not only is it historically inaccurate (forgiveable, maybe, since most kids' -and adults', for that matter- movies are), but the voices (Meg Ryan, John Cusack, Christopher Lloyd) are overdone. They sound desperate. To get out, maybe. Oh, and did i mention the obligatory romance element?Midway, i was already missing the usual Disney features, but i guess nothing better (animation-wise) came out that year."
1,Horrible product,"I love the movie so I decided to buy the DVD, but it doesn't even work properly. Part of the special features does not work and the digital copy expired in September of 2010 already so it does not let you download!"
1,Anastasia,"The DVD I received was damaged. This two disc set was not complete because the second disk did not play. I sent it back, and they sent me another one. I sent it back because the movie did not play. The second one they sent me was damaged, and it did not play. I think they just resent the same disk."
2,knockoff,"This movie is nothing more then a expensive Disney knockoff and like Mr.Toad's Wild Ride,the only good thing about this film is the villain song.No comment on the other film. I give both films a 2 out of 10."
3,"Not Original, but great animation.","The movie Anastasia's story line was original. But, things the characters did were comparable to Disney. For example, when Rasputen sings In The Dark Of The Night. The way the choreography is, is reminds me of Scar's Song in The Lion King. The dog is like Abu to Alladin. Plus, the bat is like Eago to Jafar. The animation was well done. But, there were too many digital scenes. When a door shuts, it's all digital and then the cut to a scene that looks all drawn. The movie was good, but it seems it was put together too quickly. Thank you."
3,"good, but why no widescreen?","This was a very great animated film, but why wasn't it released in it's original widescreen 2.35:1 format? It does state right on the disc that it's in widescreen, but it is not. If it was indeed in widescreen, I would have rated it four stars. The only flaw I saw in the film itself is that the antagonist's character really isn't focused on enough to become truly fearful."
5,Anastasia DVD,"Don Bluth does it again. Great movie, great villian and great villian side kick (voice by Hank Azia of The Simpson's, Mad About You and Herman's Head fame). Meg Ryan is Anastasia, John Cusack is Demetri, and Kelsey Grammer is Demetri's partner. Very well done, entertaining with great original songs (sung by professionals not the actors)."
3,Good movie but high price.,"Thought I was getting a sweet deal on this Blu-Ray until I visited Sam's CLUB today and saw it, new, for more than half off of what I paid here at Amazon. I love Amazon, I use it all the time because I'm confident they have the best price, but Sam's Club has the Anastasia Blu-Ray for 9.95. Geesh. That's all, I wanted to save you 11 bucks if I can =)"
3,My Expectations were too High,"I got this DVD thinking that it would be amazing. Sadly, I was a bit disappointed. While the art in the movie was absolutely stunning, I thought there were some parts of the story that were a bit odd. For one, I thought it was strange that she could not remember any of her past, as if that happened to a child in real life it is likely that they would experience traumatic nightmares until adulthood. Also, I did not care for the evil bat."
1,Possibly the worst animated feature film ever,"I don't remember seeing a more predictable and repulsive movie in my entire life. The whole story seems to be made up of the most common elements of a typical kid's cartoon, compiled together to make a uniformily miserable cinematic experience. The caricatural representations of Russia and France are downright distasteful and offensive. The use of an ultimately tragic subject matter and melodramatic soundtrack is a dishonorable use of people's emotions. There is really nothing going for this pathetic excuse of a movie, and even a brief glimpse of it should be avoided at all cost."
1,Horrible Movie for Children,I rented this recently thinking it would be a non violent movie for my children to watch. I was SO wrong. This is a terrifying movie for young viewers. It is also very hard for children to comprehend the story line. I think I'm done with Disney animated movies from now on. Yuck.
1,I couldn't rate this lower...,"If there is anything lower than making an animated childrens movie about the brutal murder of a family, I don't know what that would be. Those who made this should be ashamed."
5,I Loved It,I loved this movie. It is so exciting and interesting to watch. There is never a dull moment in the movie stuff keeps happing. I recomend this movie to everyone. You'll love it. Ohh and the music is great!
5,I'm happy!,"I was concerned about getting this version of the video after reading the reviews. However, I love it and I'm really happy with it!"
5,Wonderful Movie!,"This is a fantasic cartoon, it is fascinating even for adults. I thought this was a disney film for a long time and was very surprised to find out that is wasn't, it is deffinitely as good as any Disney movie. It is a thrilling experience for kids and adults to watch!"
2,Not the best.,"An interesting yarn, but not much technical or even practical info on solo sailing of small boats. I enjoyed the scathing criticism of the uptight Florida Marina Communities, but would have liked to see more details about his experiences in the Northeast Final leg of the voyage. If you're contemplating a long small boat voyage, don't bother reading this. Given the inexperience and naivite' of the author, it's a miracle he didn't get in more trouble or drown."
2,A bit of a disappointment,"It's refreshing to see that books are now being published about dinghy cruising. Throughout his trip Lee was very good at regularly updating the Canadian Wayfarer website about to his exciting trip and I had anticipated a really good book to be the end result. This was not the case though as I found his book to be of little merit from a ""sailor's point of view"" and falters to nothing more than a glorified log-book by a rookie sailor who quite frankly is lucky his inexperience on such an ambitious trip didn't kill him.This book is defintely NOT to be used as a reference guide for dinghy cruisers."
2,a read for armchair non sailors,"wish i hadnt bought the book it will end up being donated somewhere. The valuable information is that for beginners they should start with a small boat, preferably a dinghy and learn the craft. The author bought his boat fully equipped for crusing from frank dye whose books are well worth buying.Although the writing style is readable, I am convinced that the author really doesnt like sailing or the sea. There is a mechanical approach to getting from a to b and if it means breaking out the credit card or asking for a tow so be it. The final nail in the coffin is the authors cutting short the trip because?"
2,"Falls short, just like the author's quest","With all the inspirational accounts of people achieving their dreams why should we be compelled to read a book about someone who comes close and then gives up? Never more than a few miles offshore, a little uncomfortable, and homesick - the author throws in the towel. This book does not belong on the same shelf with Tinkerbelle or some of the other classic small boat adventures."
5,Hey Big Spender check out this Sailing Cruiser,"You don't need a mega-yacht to chave fun cruising the East Coast of the US. This Aussie sailor conquers the east coast in a fifteen foot sailboat and has fun doing it.I bought the book because I was incredulous that some nut could transit the east coast and ""live-a-board"" in such a small boat, but this man delivers a great story while explaining why the keep it simple stupid principal can work for almost anyone silly enough to try it. And God Bless him, the author makes it work and tells an entertaining story of his voyage."
1,Accurate title to say the least,"If you want funk then buy the Balck Lace series of books... but I warn you I think that most of the books in this series are aimed toward fetishists ....The good news and bad news is that alough there is no S&M this book definitely delves into beastiality. If that is your thig then BUY THIS BOOK.Jo, the young (human) main character explores her sexuality and decidedly being a cat in another life (of sorts) she really does explore this aspect of her life.If Jo was your girlfriend I would worry more about leaving her at home alone this your dag than I would worry about her remaining faithfull to you ..."
2,Not up to Black Lace Standards,"I've read tons of the Black Lace novels, but I really didn't enjoy this one. The main character seemed interested in sex and nothing else...there seemed to be no other motivation to her existance. While that might be some people's dream woman, it made for a very dull novel."
3,Interesting,"I found the book interesting but very ""dry"". Timex were very hard for woman who wanted to be not just nurses, but physicians. As these women broke ground in a male dominated profession, they had to endure all manner of ignorance."
2,Not sure it's working,"The service was fast, order shipped very quickly.As far as the product goes, Weve done a lot of searching and reading on this product. Some of their products work well, this one I am not so sure if it is doing the trick. We have followed the directions, and are waiting for the results it promises. Will update again."
2,"Breathing is much better, snoring is much worse!","I went to a sleep clinic and they confirmed that my snoring depends only of my weight, I don't have sleep apnea and after losing some weight, my wife confirmed that my snoring was gone.I got some weight back and I'm snoring again like a sawmill, keeping my wife awake all night!I tried this item and I did actually breath much better, but my spouse said that the noise that I was making was much worse.I have to say that they are quite comfortable and they help breathing, but unfortunately they don't stop snoring."
4,Open nose.,If you used breath-rightbandages then you will like these. Same principle used but you can use these over and over again at a lot less cost. I order and got two of these I think for $10. Worth the try. They opened up my nose. First night got through about four hrs of sleep then thing started bugging me but after a couple of nights of sleep my nose does not care it is there. My wife says I snore. I tried the mouth guard thing to move your jar forward but it gave me a headache all the next day and then next so that did not work out. Asked the wife if this corrected by snoring and she said I had a little early in the morning. She said the best thing to stop the snoring is for me to continue to sleep in the guest bedroom!I am kinda like this because now I don't share the bed with her three cats!But when we do travelI think this little nose thing will be the cats meow (minus the real cats!) For $10 bucks give it a try.
3,Give it a chance,"I was recommended this product by my specialist, as I've been having trouble breathing. I think it is the sort of product you have to try a few times to appreciate the full effect. It isn't the most comfortable thing, especially because it comes in one size, which means its a bit big for me, and the ring gets caught on my top lip. But it definately does open up your nasal passages and help your breathing. So if you can get past the discomfort factor, then it is useful, and certainly good value for money. Shame you can't buy them in my country though!!"
3,A Little Stiff,"The product does what it says it will do. It opens up nasal passages so you can breathe easier. However, the material is stiff and so it gets irritating and hurts your nose after an hour or two of using it."
1,Uncomfortable,"I would not recommend this product to anyone unless you can tolerate something up your nose while you sleep. Not too mention that if brush the covers or pillow against your face, it will dislodge the strip."
1,not worth the price,"I bought these to help me breathe at night while sleeping. They worked well for a couple of nights. I wasn't offered a selection of size when ordering, although they do come in 3 sizes. I'm not sure what size I really got. They started to slip out at night after a few uses. I've tossed them out. I went back to the nasal strips which are better but costly in the long run. I wouldn't recommend them."
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!,"I ordered this item on March 23rd and I thought that it was ridicluous that the delivery estimate was listed as March 30th-April 1st. Anyway, I opened my email on April 1st to find that the item ONLY SHIPPED ON MARCH 31st VIA USPS (the slowest)from acreoss the country. It's going to be more than 2 weeks from ordering before i get an item that could have been put in the mail the day i ordered it. BUY SOMEWHERE ELSE> THE PRICES ARE ALL PRETTY SIMILAR!!!"
2,It may work if you can leave it in!!,For the low price figured I would give it a try if it helps my snoring so my wife can sleep. Well I tried it for 2 nights and each night during my sleep my nose was too irritated by it and pulled it out. So I gave up on that and tried the Snore Pin also offered here and have been able to leave it in no problem and seems to be helping but not all the time.
3,Almost the perfect solution,"The Nozovent is fairly large -- no problem for me, but smaller noses beware!These devices are also pretty aggressive in opening your nose at first. They seem to lose some tension after a couple of weeks and become more comfortable.The Nozovent is easy to clean, I wash mine with Dr. Bronners soap.Every now and then the Nozovent has the not so amusing ability to spring out of my nose while I am sleeping...instant wake up as this feel really strange.I have a deviated septum and often have trouble breathing through my nose easily. For me the Nozovent works at bed time most of the time."
3,works-sometimes,"This product will work well if your nostrils stay dry through the night. For me, this is a 50-50 proposition; there is often mucous flow overnight, and the device pops out in that situation. When it works, it is effective. But it pops out so often I've stopped using it."
4,An unexpected success,"I bought this to replace wearing breathe rite strips every nite as my nose was beginning to react to the constant exposure to the adhesive. I couldn't decide from several different styles, so I bought three. I have tried all three, but the Nozovent is the one I use almost every night. It takes a little while to get used to, but it really works. I not only use it while sleeping, I use it while exercising too.It's not the most flattering to wear, looks a bit like a bull with a nose ring, but breathing is more important, right? I also love that they sent two, meaning I can wash one and let it dry all day while using the other when I exercise. I use the small case to help flatten them back out after a night of wear.Cons:- It does fall out occasionally, but I don't see an easy way to change that.- Unlike the breathe rite strips, sneezing requires you to take out Nozovent. That could be annoying during allergy or flu season.All in all, great product for the price"
2,"not comfortable, but it works","It's not comfortable, but I could deal with it. It does work. Unfortunately it irritated the nasal lining such that I could only use it for 2 -3 days in a row."
4,"Does the job, but adjusting took a few days","I am satisfied with this product. It arrived just on time and I tried it out the night it arrived. The instructions seemed a bit lacking so I had to check the instructions in Youtube. I initially thought the product was slightly painful, but after a while I noticed that breathing was a lot better. I had a good night's sleep since the day I bought this. I recommend it with four stars."
4,Nozovent Anti-Snore,"Basically, this is a type of stent for your nose that helps you breathe easier and snore less. It works fairly well for me. I notice increased sleep quality. It has some pretty good traction bumps, but sometimes it falls out during the course of the night. The whole thing is made of some kind of silicon that may feel kinda stiff at first, but with regular use and cleaning it tends to soften up. Seems pretty inert. No strong chemical smell that I can detect. Functionally, I believe this device is not as good compared to some other products. But, it's great to have at your bedside when you want to crash right away and don't feel like doing all the prep it takes to properly apply a nasal strip."
3,Is ok,"Works better then sticky strips but it is not perfect.It opens the air-way well but, often comes out while sleeping.I think it is a bit better then stick on strips that come off as well.When they do stay in most the night, I can tell because, I am not as tired in the morning.Is a little rough on the inside of the nose but can handle it.I am still looking for a better product! Any Ideals??"
2,Painful,I tried this some time ago. It is really painful to my nostrils and there's no way I could sleep in it! very uncomfortable.
1,Worthless device,"We purchased this device for my husband. It will not stay in his nose for even a minute, and this is when he's awake trying to be careful not to touch it against anything. Don't waste your money on this!"
2,It comes out too easily,"It did open my passages, but I noticed a couple of issues. First, sometimes it would come out in the middle of the night. Second, it tickles when you put it in. Third, after using it 3 nights in a row, it started to irritate my nasal passages. As a result, I stopped using it. The real solution for my breathing at night was resolved by buying a really great air cleaner, and by occasionally using anti-histamines before going to bed."
3,Nozovent Anti-Snore,"This product was great for breathing when I was suffering from allergies, but didn't help prevent snoring much."
4,I love this product! Even with deviated septum.,"I have tried a number of anti-snoring products. I've tried homeopathic sprays and pellets. I've tried spray supplements, and I've tried one of the mouthpieces. None of the sprays or pellets worked, and the mouthpiece, when I could get it to stay in, suffocated me!I like this device, however. It slips easily into the nose and opens the airways. I have a deviated septum, and it works great. My husband says I do still snore, but he can't observe me having apnea events. The snoring certainly isn't as loud. I do wake up much more refreshed using this product.My only complaint is that I do sometimes remove it in my sleep. Because it is clear, it is very difficult to find in the dark, even with a flashlight. I would love to have an option of a color, so that I could find it easier when I do take it out in my sleep."
3,It's OK but other products worked better for me,"I initially used Nozovent and as others have stated I experienced some discomfort. But, I used it because of the relieve in breathing and the increase in the volume of air I experienced. After reading the preceding reviews I then brought Sinus Cones & Max-Air Cones. I am very pleased with both products more so then with the Nozovent. I use the Sinus Cones while sleeping and the Max-Air Cones during the day. What a tremendous difference they have made in my life. I will look into CPAP machine in the near future but finally breathing correctly is WONDERFUL!"
3,I Cut them Down To Fit Without Pain,"I'm female with a standard size nose. These are for a LARGE nose. I don't snore, I wanted them to breath better during sleep, so I wouldn't be completely drained of all energy the following day.These were very painful, hence unusable for me. Then I thought to cut them down to fit my nose. Now they only hurt if my nose is touched. It's nearly impossible to sleep without your nose being touched, by movement/pillow.PICTURE - I have uploaded a picture. You can see the original size and the cut down size next to a ruler.I hope this helps you make an informed decision."
3,pretty good,"so i switched to these over the sticky stuff cuz the sticky stuff left goo on my nose and made it itchy. in that respect it's great cause it opens the nasal passage (i have allergies, but don't snore, so i can't attest to what they'll do for snoring). but it gets more and more uncomfortable as the night goes: its edges cut into the nostril walls. i don't understand why there's no small/medium/large for this, cause if they were a tiny bit smaller they probly wouldn't hurt (and believe me, i have huge nostrils). so by the middle of the night they hurt so much i rip them out and toss them to the side. given how much cheaper they are than the sticky nasal strips, and how you don't have to put more chemicals on your face and into the trash can, nozovent is good, and others might not have this edge problem like i do. i haven't tried them for exercise yet but they seem like they'll stay put."
4,Good airway opener,"I'm giving this only 4 stars because although it does a good job of opening the airway for breathing at night, it:1) can get dislodged fairly easy if you roll over2) did not stop my snoringIt does help a great deal with keeping the airway open and it might possibly help with snoring as everyone is different."
2,I can't use it and neither can my husband,"It made my husband keep sneezing. For me the inside of my nose is dry and sensitive. So it felt like if I left it in, it might create serious irritations in my nose. What was good about it was it did open our noses. It was easier to breate when it was in. We are both in our 60's. Perhaps if we were younger it might be okay."
1,Doesn't stay in and doesn't prevent snoring,"So this products claims to reduce snoring by somehow keeping the nasal passages open; however, this product stays very near the opening of the nostrils, while I can feel my snoring vibrations coming from much deeper in the nasal cavity. Essentially this product has no effect whatsoever on my snoring. I had the same experience with the Snorepin, except the Snorepin stayed in better though I simply ended up breathing through my mouth and waking up with a sore dry throat and tongue. No good"
1,Waste of money.,Doesn't help with snoring at all. It's way too big and I had to cut the ends to even get it to fit in my nose. It was painful and didn't even prevent my snoring. Definitely wouldn't recommend this product to anybody.
3,So-So Snoring,"Got this because I snore and will soon be attending a conference where I'll be sharing a room. Didn't want to keep my roomie up all night.During the summer some of my neighbors have asked me to put on the air conditioner and close my windows because they can hear me when their windows are open. Definitely snore like a freight train.Anyway, this product seems to work okay, after about a week it seemed to be bending out of shape a bit. A couple of things about this item, initially it irritated the inner lining of my nostrils, after a couple of weeks, I found myself apparently removing it in my sleep. It works best when used with a homeopathic stop-snore spray. In fact, I've basically stopped wearing it and just use the homeopathic spray now with almost the same results. Get a much better sleep and have more energy using it. Over all, try it if you want to, it's cheap and it might work better for you."
1,not worth..,This is a waist of money ....I will discourage people from buying this...the tape on top of the nose is least intrusive than this...
3,Worth a try,"This product works well and it feels really great to have my nasal passages wide open at night when trying to sleep. It has cut down on snoring. My problem is that I have gotten into the habit of breathing through my mouth and when breathing through the mouth you will still snore. Also, it looks sort of funny. But I continue to use it every night and hope that eventually I'll stop breathing through my mouth at night and completely stop snoring. I would recommend this. It is not expensive and is worth a try."
1,Doesn't work as advertised...i suppose,"basically i snore, so i bought this product to see if it helps, i guess it does let me breath better through my nose, but from what i hear, i still snore, equally loud as before, so no, i do not recommend buying this product"
3,"OK, not as great as I thought it would be","I was very excited to try this product from all the great reviews from it. Maybe it is me, but this product did not work for me as well as it was supposed to. I put it in correctly, and spent a long time making sure it was in right, but in the middle of the night it fell out and now I can't find it. Of course I have a back up just in case. So, I tried the backup, but my roommate said I snored as though I were not doing anything to prevent it. The uncomfortable feeling also never wore off for me. So, sadly, I will be sticking with the nose strips, even though I was hoping this would replace them and I could help the environment a little. They just were not that big success. But if it worked for everybody else who left a review I would say give it a try, you never know! I guess my nose just wasn't made for this kind of thing (and my nose isn't an odd shape either.. it's kind of small. So that could have been the problem too.)"
1,don't waste your money,"Well, now I've learned that snoring has nothing at all to do with keeping the nasal passages open - but have everything to do with muscles in the throat closing slightly, which forces the sleeper to snort out and in - creating lots of noise aka snoring.This product does nothing to reduce snoring.If snoring is the result of a cold, stuffy nose, etc - try the nasal strips. They are far better and way less uncomfortable, and much more sanitary."
4,Solved my snoring problem but can irritate occasionally,Tried this after trying Breathright strips. The strips worked for half the night but would unpeel at the edge and lose their effectiveness. The nozovents completely fixed my snoring. They were a little uncomfortable at first but with practice and if you insert them carefully aren't too bad(there is a video on youtube). When inserted it looks like there is a ring sticking out of your nose and if you roll over in bed and hit the part that is sticking out it can be uncomfortable. Overall very happy and willing to deal with the occasional discomfort.
1,Doesn't work for me,Tried and tried to get this thing to stay in my nose and it just wouldn't stay. Then it made my nose start to bleed bummer I was looking forward to not using the stick on nose strips but they work. This was a waste of my money.
1,Won't stay in,"The thing is hard to put in and usually pops out immediately. Even when it does stay in for a minute, it slides out on one nostril minutes later. I would put up with the initial little pain, if it worked."
5,Nosovent,I have been using Nosovent now for about 15 years and found that it opens my nasal pasages and gives me a good night 's sleep. I use this in preference to sprays which dilate the veins in the nose and eventually weaken them to the extent that they can no longer be dilated. Nosovent does the job well with no long term problems.
1,Not a solution to stop snoring,"Tried to use this devise for many days but it didn't help me to stop snoring. My wife is still complaining and promising to move me to another room to ""sing my night songs"" so she can sleep normally. This Anti-Snore helper doesn't stay in your nose firmly. When you turning on your side it is jumping out of your nose easily. Always have to search for it in the bed or on the floor next day.May be I should use crazy glue along, but there is nothing in instructions about that.I have to try something else."
1,painful,This was so incrediblely painful that the pain kept waking me in the middle of the night. I finally just took it out.
3,Funky But Too Derivative,"I love everything I've heard on the Daptone label up to this one, think they're doing great stuff (especially with The Budos Band). But I've got to kind of blow the whistle on this release. The funk offered here is raw, is tight, has a nice groove . . . but somehow it leaves an emptiness at the end. It's just too perfect, too pat, too much exactly what someone trying to sound funky in that Famous Flames way should sound. The Mighty Imperials are quite adept at aping the sound of James Brown and his band in their prime, and maybe should just rename themselves something gimmicky and become a Famous Flames tribute band. They have a song called ""Cold Sweat"" and another one with the word ""Popcorn"" in it - geez!! The worst part is when the vocalist comes in - absolutely meaningless, unconvicing funk platitudes sung by someone just mailing it in. These guys know how to play but they need to either find a way to create their own identity or hang it up and become a tribute band."
5,Amazing,"I have no words, really my wife would not stop mourn the end of the movie.intense, surprising, sad, happy, sentimental, inspiring, emotional,"
5,Family entertainment that's not just for the kids,"The first time I viewed this film I was a young teen. Now as a 29 year old guy I find this film just as entertaining as I did all those years ago. In a nutshell this is a film about a boy and the dog who found him,changed him,and saved his life when they were both shipwrecked. This film will appeal to anyone from 5 to 95 who enjoy clean adventurous family films."
5,Great story,I highly reccomend this movie. Beautiful scenery and believable acting. Plus the dog in the movie is so cool.Very touching every time.
4,HEARTWARMING FAMILY FILM,"Young Jesse Bradford gives a heartwarming performance as Angus, a young lad who adopts a labrador and names it Yellow Dog. On a sailing trip with father Bruce Davison (effective in a non-typical role), he and the dog are thrown overboard and faced with surviving in uncharted Pacific Northwest. Mimi Rogers plays Angus' mother, and the parents' dedication in believing their son is still alive is touching as well. Although the movie doesn't give us a lot of ""adventures"" with the boy and his dog, it nonetheless focuses on Angus' survival skills and the devotion of his dog. One particularly poignant scene involves a rabbit. Early in the film, Bradford and his buddies are chasing a rabbit and he has the opportunity to kill it with his slingshot but upon seeing the cute little thing, he scares it away. When he is lost, a rabbit is once again caught by the dog and Angus realizes the difference between hunting for play and for survival. An enjoyable family film."
5,Good detail,This book has much more information and historical detail in it than the title suggests.
4,Love this,I bought this MP3 player and found that I could not be without it! Love it! Good for those of us who are electornically challenged. No tricky software to figure out. Just plug into the removable disk drive and click and drag from your files to load!
1,Zen Nano Plus,This product did not work from the beginning and I sent it back and bought my son and husband Sandisk MP3 players and they found them very easy to use and I plan on buying another one for my other son.
3,Great Sound and Battery Life,"Pluses:Great Sound, great battery life, voice recording is clear, storing music to it is as easy as drag and drop - you do not need the software that came with it.Minuses:I accidentally dropped mine less than 3 feet from the floor (imagine coat pocket to floor distance) with its protective casing on - and now the battery cover does not snap back into place. Also FM reception is very poor - there is no reception even on the 2nd floor of a 3-story building."
1,Full of Bugs - Pass for now,"I am a Creative fan. I have a Jukebox 3 and a MuVo TX FM which I lost and wanted to replace. I purchased a Zen Nano Plus 1GB and it was glitchy. It showed up in my device manager and after 5 min in explorer but it was never accessible.I'm no dummy (BSEE) and spent about 5 hrs trying to get this USB device to work with no luck. I suggest you visit the creative interactive support site as see for your self the number of people having problems with this particular mp3 player.I returned mine to Amazon and went and purchased another MuVo TX FM. Plugged it in and it works fine.Maybe Creative will fix the bugs with this thing but until they do its hit or miss. Some people have no problems and other have problems that can be fixed with good support (another hit or miss) and still others like myself have players that just will not work.Good luck, D"
4,Great little player for the price,"I did a lot of online research before I purchased an MP3 player. I was initially going to buy a SanDisk e200, but the store didn't stock it. The salesman convinced me this little Zen Nano for 1/3 the price of the SanDisk would be very user friendly. He was so right! I was ripping songs from my CD's in no time after loading the software. I only want some music (FM radio on here is great, too!) and don't want to carry around a big CD player. Don't care that there's no color LCD screen with pictures. Highly recommended if you're just looking for something small to hold lots of music. Sound is great, but might buy different eye buds...these are a little large. I'm glad I didn't spend a lot of money on a player with with features I don't really need."
4,Great player for the price and features...ear buds need work,This is a great mp3 player for the price. It's very small and great for the gym. The sound is pretty good and you can customize the EQ. To be honest I do not have any use for the voice recorder or to record the radio but I do use the radio often.The only problems I had was with the driver's to load the music onto the device. It would only fill up half of the 1 GB. I believe it may have been an issue with my computer because it works fine now since I bought a new computer.The earbuds have pretty good sound and are fairly comfortable but start to hurt over time. The first pair I had didn't not last long as one of the buds died. I replaced them with the same model I ordered from manufacturer's website. For both pairs that I had I noticed that the foam pieces do not stay on the earbuds very well.This player is very much worth the price but you may want to use your old earbuds or invest some money in better ones.
4,Easily worth the cash to add to your collection.,"After having no success with a Sandisk Sansa C240 (see my review of that) we decided to go for Creative. We should have just done it to begin with as I've owned nothing but Creative and iRiver in the MP3 market (Nomad Jukebox, Creative Zen Vision) and they all are fantastic. No problems at all. EVER.The first thing you notice about this is it feels solid. This little player while light, has a good weight. It sounds great and comes with an armband. That's right, comes with an armband. That will save you $25 right there.If you workout, look no further. This is the MP3 player for you.Very tiny buttons and a somewhat confusing interface to work through keep it at just under a 5 star rating."
4,Small but good MP3 player,"Overall I'm pleased with the Zen Nano Plus.Pros:- considerably smaller than most other players- comes with armband and belt clip holder; armband is good for exercising- uses one AAA battery, and it seems to last a long time- easy to drag and drop to add musicCons:- I could not get this to work with Yahoo! Music Unlimited ""To Go"" service, despite a claim on Creative's web page that it would work. The unit is Windows ""Plays For Sure"" compatible, but maybe Yahoo Music is not. I tried updating the firmware and drivers but still was unable to transfer subscription songs to the player via Yahoo Music Engine.- Small display, but usable- navigation with the scroll wheel is a bit cumbersome- supplied headphones are just ok"
4,"Oh Zen Nano, how do I love thee?","I bought this I think a couple of years ago so it may not even be sold anymore. Still...it's working great. I bought it to replace my iPod shuffle, whose battery gave up the ghost 54 weeks after purchase (really.) Apple were happy to repair it for about $2 less than the cost of buying a replacement. I declined. (I will never buy an iPod again.) The Zen however runs on one AAA battery, so that avoids a potential repeat.Pros: Let me counteth the ways...AAA battery means never having to say ""I'm sorry...I bought this.""Functional menu navigation (folders, EQ, you name it), albeit with small screen1 GB memory seemed okay at time of purchaseVoice record functionEasy, non-proprietary upload and download capabilityNot another Apple rip-off.Cons: 1 GB now seems smallLacks the cool looks of an iPod. I careth now not :)"
5,GREAT MP3 player!!,"I have had one of these for 10 months and I love it! I use it often and it has never given me any problems! Great sound and user friendly.My daughter has an ipod. Although the Zen Nano I have is not as powerful, I still prefer it.If you don't want to shuck out the money for an ipod, don't buy one of the cheap MP3 players. I would highly reccommend the Zen Nano!"
5,Very easy to use,"This is my first mp3 player and so far I am very pleased with this product. The fact that it uses an AAA battery means that you don't have to put an adaptor in your backpack. If you want to travel light, it is a good advantage over other players which usually don't come with this option. The sound quality is very good. The software is very intuitive to use. I remember that my cousin had to spend long hours to learn how to manage the software iPod comes with so I was a little woried about it. But I did not even have to read the booklet to use the software. You can easily add, delete and reorganize the music.Initially I thought that this player doesnot have enough volume. Then I realize that the jackphone was loose and you have to push it hard for it to go all the way in. Then I had such a high volume that I will probably use it in half volume most of the time.The only negative comment I have is that transfering music is a little slower than I expected."
3,It does the job for now...,"After reading all the rave reviews this item received, I thought it was going to be so much better than it actually was. It doesn't hold nearly 500 songs like the description reads. It holds less than 200 of my music. The shuffle feature sucks if you have lots of songs in one folder. It will play the same song four times in one sitting, while skipping tons of other songs! When I found that it wasn't playing some of my songs, I had to dump songs from several different folders into a root folder just to hear them played. You get what you pay for. I would rather have spent twice as much to get a better MP3 player."
2,Pass on this one,"Player started shutting itself off just after the actual 90 day warranty period. Good sounding player for the money, but very demanding with the proprietary software. The only way to get it to work now, until my new purchase arrives, is to bang it on a table top. Then after some undetermined period, it will shut itself off again."
4,Very good item,"Small, lightweight and effective. Excellent value. Flexible downloading. The on/off button is in the wrong place as other reviews have mentioned. I have had no problems with ear buds. Highly recommend this player for price and quality."
5,"Wonderfully small, easy to use.","I'll try not to repeat what everyone else have mentioned. Some of the things I have noticed about this MP3 player early on: (1) The display is easy to read for a somewhat small display. (2) Has an equalizer. (3) Comes with a lot of accessories like arm band, earphones, line-in cable, rubber case w/ belt clip. (4) Quite a bit of software which I have yet to know what they do. (5) A NiMH rechargable AAA battery will last around 8 hours. Your mileage may vary. (6) Without reading the manual, I was able to manage around the vast menu selection. It was a very well laid out GUI. (7) I considered strongly the color of the Nano before I bought it. Once I got the damn thing, it was so tiny, color didn't matter anymore."
5,I love my nano,"So far it has been terrific. Radio and downloads are easy to sort out and use.Downloading was hard, but I finally got it. The sound quality is the best thing, however. It is better than my big stereo.Napster doesn't do this mp3 however.It does now.And did I mention that I put it throughthe washer and drier and it works just fine?"
3,Independent and stubborn,A Bitter Creek novel - Attorney Luke Creed's job is to find crooked businessmen.

But Amy is both independent and stubborn and although she is lonely Luke's advances are not welcomed.Reviewed by Janet Sue Terry author of the Set Me Free Series -Possibilities and Resolutions.

3,The Price,"This was a good book, the whole series by Joan Johnston was excellent. I have since gone on to read more of her books. When I got this series wasnt sure I would like it, by I did and so does my sister. Thank You"
2,"Good book, poor condition!","Good book series, love Joan Johnston. The seller said the book was in better shape than it was, but what did I expect for $0.01."
5,A fascinating gathering of wilderness experiences,"Best Of Outdoor Life could also have been featured in our sports section but any interested in the outdoors will find this collection of hunting, fishing and survival stories to provide many insights on nature. The best stories from Outdoor Life Magazine are compiled in a fascinating gathering of wilderness experiences."
4,A country alternative to screaming metal.,"A very fresh take on the end times (fresh may not be the best word there). But if you are a fan of the macabre, or a disappointed Baptist then this is for you."
2,be cautious when purchasing this book,"As a water fitness instructor, I did not find this book to be a very good resource. 1) Most of the exercises in the this book can be done without an aqua noodle. 2) Some of the exercises, in particular, those in which the participant hangs suspended by the shoulders, with the noodle under the armpits, are contraindicated--hanging by the shoulders from any floation device can cause joint injury. 3) In large classes, the exercises using 2 noodles and other floataion devices are not feasible. 4) the abdominal exercises shown do not use water resistance effectively---many upright exercises that encourage participants to stabilize in turbulent water are much more effective. I was hoping for some creative, innovative, and safe exercises, but there are none in this book."
3,Water Exercises OK help for Water Aerobics,"This book is very simplified. It would be great for someone who has no idea what they're doing in aquatic exercises. I purchased it to gather some new ideas for the water aerobics classes i teach implementing the aqua noodles we have but rarely use. I got a few stretches, leg exercises, and fun games out of it, but since we have other equipment that is much more useful than the way they use the noodle in the book, I have probably already used all the new moves from the book that I ever will. It would be great for someone looking to do a light workout or possibly activites with children, but is not extremely helpful for those with prior aquatic exercise knowledge."
3,Balance Disc,"The disc arrived quickly, but no directions on how to use it were enclosed. I don't know how to use it. It is a quality product."
1,Incomplete shipment- seller not responding,I thought that this would be useful to at least try. The box arrived with opposite ends torn off- so there was no way to even return it. I borrowed an air pump only to realize that there is no seal in the large blue disc.So I have a useless plastic disc until I get assistance from Amazon to rectify the situation.This seller refused to respond to my e-mail.
3,ordinary beach life,"The picture quality is not good. It doesn't have any color pictures. And some look as if snapshots. I don't want to be judgemental, it is just like any regular peeping tom's photos. If you stay by the beach long enough, and take enough shots, you can just publish a book like that.If you miss the beach, this could be a book for you. You can just look at those pictures and feel the presense of all those young guys as if they were right in front of you."
1,Not good,"The product didn't perform as promised. Luckly, it was used on ""old"" glasses, the glasses were no longer of any use. I did received a refund, which was a plus."
2,Too Early to Determine DDF Intensive Holistic Lightener's Effectiveness,"It is a too early to determine if the product, DDF Intensive Holistic Lightener, is effective. I have been using this product for about one month and I believe that it will require 3-months of daily useage to really determine its effectiveness."
3,blues from charts,"Everybody's playing from charts on this CD. That's my kind of HELL! When I think of Allen Toussaint, stiff lack-luster arrangements do not come to mind. Big dissappointment - huge. New Orleans Heat? Sure doesn't sound like anybody broke a sweat, or maybe I just couldn't hear it over the full orchestra back-up. At times this reminds me of the theme song to Shaft."
5,All kids love LOG!,"This t-shirt was incredibly soft, the colors were very bold and didn't fade in the wash, and it arrived in the mail quickly even though I ordered it a little over a week before Christmas, it actually came a few days before the Winter Solstice, which was great because that's what I celebrate. My boyfriend loved it and wears it all the time. He says it's his second most comfortable shirt after his baby-soft Ghostbusters t-shirt. :)Now all we need is a girl's baby-doll cut LOG t-shirt in red for me! How about it Old Glory?Or what about Powdered Toast Man? Eh?Sincerely-Super Satisfied Customer Anjanette"
1,Waste of money!,"I was really excited when I bought this player; I thought it would be awesome. I took it home after buying it and it was nice, cool UI, and it worked with Windows Media Player. The buttons felt plasticy, though.Unfortunately, after a few weeks, the player got screwy. Windows Media Player had put an XML file named WMPInfo on my player that held information about it. My player got confused and starting calling my songs WMPInfo. When I tried to play them, it said ""invalid format"" or something like that. Also, it took forever to load the UI once it turned on.Then it started getting crappy. Windows Media Player was trying to sync songs onto it - and failing!Then something even worse happened: my songs started randomly stopping and skipping to different parts of the song. That was NOT WMP's fault, it was the player's!This stupid player is now a paperweight. What a piece of trash.Don't buy this. It's a ripoff."
4,"Duplicate of 'Early American Choral Music, Vol. 2'","Please note this CD is identical to another His Majestie's Clerkes CD, ""Early American Choral Music, Vol. 2 (Anglo-American Psalmody: 1550-1800)"" but with a different cover and name! I bought both and was irritated to discover this. The other version is cheaper, so I would suggest getting that one."
5,Great Recording,I was looking for a this production which was said to be of higher quality than the newer release of the songs. Very happy.
2,Chateau Benares,Disappointing use of synthetic instruments and over dubs when Mishra's skill as a guitarist would have been perfect.
3,"Fast setup, poor structure design, good customer support","I bought mine last year and used it twice. The first time I used it this year was for a yard sale. A rain storm started so we went inside. When we came back outside, the Quik Shade had collapsed. 4 snapped scissor supports, 1 snapped leg, a ripped canopy top, and 4 cracked scissor connectors.I emailed customer support and attached photos of the ""disaster"" and they said the Quik Shade was designed for shade only and not for storms so the warranty would not cover it. They still agreed to send me the replacement parts to repair it as a one time courtesy.Final review: Great for the shade, not built for weather. Take it down when a wind or rain storm starts."
5,Great purchase!!!,"Great product, easy to set up and sturdy. Provides great shade. Legs are at an angle not straight."
2,Disappointed,"We used this canopy twice for our sons soccer games. The second time we used it there was a slight breeze, the canopy blew over bending the leg and breaking the support bar. I expected it to last longer than this!!"
3,Good until the wind picked up,"Storm came through New Hampshire park, and there were more canopies like this destroyed then another design. The single scissor design did not seem to hold up to high winds as the 2 scissors forming one side design. Overall I thought the shade was OK until I saw others standing and those like mine ruined."
4,Good canopy for the money,"Paid $79.00 each for two of these and they did the job very well. If I had to complain it would be that the fabric covering while very light, is a little too light. Tore off a velcro strip with ease by accident. Otherwise these are very nice and provide great shelter from the sun as they were intended. Stakes hold them secure to the ground and it is very windy where I live."
3,Super easy to mount,"I like this tent a lot. It is easy to mount, and sturdy. The only problem is the white sidewall screening which blocks vision of the night sky. I really, really wish they offered dark screening instead, because I feel does a better job overall and doesn't block the view as much even in full daylight. Also, the screen tears very easily, so be careful with sharp objects and jagged corners of chairs, tables or pets or other wild critters who like to climb screens just for the fun of it."
1,It'a too small! SIDS risk!,"I loved this sheet when I bought it and after I washed it. Then I went to it on my Pack n Play. The sheet is too small! Yes, it is nicely snug, but it is so snug that it pulls the pad so that it is no longer flat. The sheet does not rip or anything when I put it on, but it caused the pad to bunch up so badly that I ended up returning this sheet. I thought it was too bad because this sheet is so soft!Another potential issue is that if you are using this with a child less than a year who may be sleeping on it, the sheet is not SIDS safe. It may be snug (and overly so), but the fact that it is quilted poses a SIDS risk."
5,A great buy,This is a thick/ quilted sheet and makes the pack and play bottom comfy. This is one of the nicer ones out there that I have seen. We ordered 3 of them.
4,Well made but not as thick as I'd hoped.,The sheet is soft and well made but I doubt is will add any cushion/padding to my pack and play's mattress like I'd hoped. If your just looking for something to be soft against your baby's skin then this is a good buy.
5,Loooove it,"I started using it when we traveled with our baby. He loves it: it's cozy and soft and keeps his travel bed warm. It is also easy to wipe for quick spit-ups and teething drool. Dries quick enough. We got two, they are easy to wash and dry and light weighted to carry around. I read that some of these sheets got destroyed in the dryer, but ours kept up really well."
2,Did not fit my Graco Pack n Play,"We purchased this sheet for our Graco Pack 'N Play with Twins Bassinet. Upon receiving the sheet, I washed it on the delicate cold setting and dried it on the delicate extra low setting. I tried but couldn't get the sheet to fit my 40"" x 28"" Pack 'N Play mat. Returning."
2,Does shrink - Graco Pack N Play,Maybe not all Graco products are the same size but on ours it's snug and buckles. Not that you can't fit it on but I'm not sure how comfortable it is to lay on when the bottom doesn't lay nicely flat. Wish they'd modify the length.
5,Very soft and comfortable sheet!,"I bought this for my pack n' play to add some additional padding. I loved it so much, I ended up ordering another one!"
1,beekay76,"This sheet is so snug that it pulls the mattress so it won't lay flat. Its been washed several times and I don't remember it always being like this, but it is now. Its soft and cozy, but when it creates a big bump in the mattress its not comfy and my baby doesn't sleep well. Disappointing."
5,Soft and comfy,"I purchased this to use with our Baby Trend Nursery Center play yard. The sage green matches perfectly with the play yard's colors (Columbia). It fits the mattress well, even after washing. I did let it air dry instead of running it through the dryer. It's very soft and adds a little cushion to the thin mattress, which is why I chose this sheet. I had some regular sheets, which work fine, but the mattress is so thin and there are hard bars underneath, I thought it needed a little something extra for baby's comfort. We don't use the play yard much but the few times we have, baby went right to sleep and seemed comfortable enough."
5,Soft Sheet for Toddler,"This is such a soft playpen sheet! It's not like the cold sheets typically used in a playpen. This ""sheet"" is so soft it feels more like a blanket. It fits wonderfully in our Graco Pack n' Play!"
1,Suffocation Hazard!!!,"Loved this at first, so cushy and soft! Wrong, after a few washes must have shrunk (have this in 2 colors both are in garbage now) nanny just told me today that she didn't hear baby babbling anymore so she went to check on him and found the sheet had come over the mat because it shrunk, pulling mat up (we didn't realize) which left room for baby to pull it up over mattress and onto himself, she found him between sheet and mat. Thank god he's okay!"
4,good stuff--in small doses,"It takes a special person to listen to an hour of oboe band music. Although it is a rare delight to hear a complete program of French wind music, this oboist is begging for a little diversity. Why did Goodwin squander the opportunity to feature a singer in the airs, opting instead to transcribe them for oboe solo? The transcriptions are lovely but come on enough is enough. And of course Lully was famous for his string orchestra, yet there are no strings on this recording. This cd is recommended in small doses, one suite at a time! The playing is impeccably stylish, don't miss the two chaconnes."
1,POS,"Scale starts reading low when the batteries die, which is after about a week. I hate this scale."
5,Great,The shipping was fast and the product was a great addition for my photography class. It definitely made it easier to review my pictures. Also the price was great for a college budget.
5,"""set the cruise control for a smooth ride...Special EFX""","Looks like Chieli Minucci has another hit on his hands ~ ""Butterfly"", under the banner of Shanachie...featuring an outstanding cast of special guests...Jay Beckenstein, Warren Hill, Chuck Loeb, David Mann and Roger Smith...deliver ""smooth jazz"" through twelve tracks of Minucci, Emanuel Kallins, Steve Skinner and George Jinda tunes.The entire gig is awesome, overlaying some of the best textured melodies ever recorded...performances like this puts smooth jazz in the forefront...and again Minucci shows why he's ahead of the pack.Total Time: 57:01 on 12 Tracks ~ Shananchie 5083 ~ (2001)"
5,Consistent,"I have seen Special EFX perform a couple of times @ Chicago in the early 1990's. Really enjoyed their music. Now, almost a decade later, Chielli Minucci continues to hold the group together especially since the departure of fellow bandmate George Jinda (who left the band on health grounds). This album is really good with some bouncy numbers. The key to this album is its consistency, most of the songs make enjoyable listening especially if you are driving. As another listener had written, I would love to see a full time collaboration between Chuck Loeb & Minucci in the future."
5,Great road map for the new millenium,"This is an excellent guideline for those goals you want to achieve in the new millenium. It has a step by step guide for just about any aspect of your life you want to get in order....be it personal, financial, spiritual....Using this book as a guideline makes just about any goal you have previously seen as out of reach seem very reachable....all you have to add is the desire to do so."
5,Great gift for anyone!,I am so glad that Amazon is now selling this book. I have given more than five copies as gifts. They are great for young to older people. We all can learn something from this book. Joanne makes life a continual learning experience.
1,"Transcribed, not written","I wanted to like this book; I love what those women did. I had heard about the calendar in 2000, and then while visiting England last autumn, I heard about the movie. While visiting England again at Christmas, I was given the book as a gift and was pleasantly surprised. However, because of a lack of narrative, the book is eventually unreadable; it reads like a word-for-word transcription of Ms. Stewart's diary. Some of the words are very funny -asides in conversation transcribed- but there aren't enough of them. And, without a thread of a story to lead the reader along, I lost interest; I hadn't made it halfway through before giving up and skipping to the epilogue."
1,1 start should be 0 stars,"I should've listened to the other reviewers here before I bothered with this book. I bought it at a discount book store ($5 wasted) and thought I could find something in it that others couldn't. Wrong. By page 30 the author had said the word ""brilliant"" about 18 times and indeed rattled on incessantly about insignificant, painstaking details.The movie version (Calendar Girls) of this book, however, was charming and highly recommended. First time I've ever said that the book sucked but the movie was great."
2,Not great for sleeping,"This product would be great for swimming, but for sleeping with it's horrible. Noise is barely blocked out, and your hands and ears are left sticky after touching these waxy earplugs. I was hoping for something moldable because regular earplugs usually hurt my ears. I would much rather deal with an annoying pain than deal with the messy wax."
5,The Only Ear Plugs That Work for Me,"All of my life I've struggled with ear plugs. I have VERY small ears and ear canals and even the women's foam ear plugs wouldn't work for me. As a graduate student they are now 100% necessary for my focus since I have to do a lot of work in public spaces. These are the only ear plugs I took out the package, followed the directions, and found myself with completely sealed off ears. It was heaven! These are perfect and I doubt I'll ever go back to foam ear plugs or any other kind."
1,Disappointed,"Snoring is just one of those things you wish never existed. Especially when you are the one desperate for peace and quiet to sleep! I have used multiple earplugs all foam in the past and paid particular attention in the sound rating before I buy. Followed the instructions and tested the plugs before going to bed. Unfortunately, snoring was so loud, it was as if the plugs didn't even exist. Right now best I can do is apply my foam plugs dangerously tight against my eardrums and at times wake up the culprit to adjust his position. Still looking and tired. :("
5,Very comfortable,My mom used these when I was little and I have always preferred them. I like that they mold to the ear but do not get oily and hot like others. The cotton keeps them nice and cool. I have trouble using foamies-they just never seal in my little ear canals so I need a form fitting kind like these. I sometimes tear one piece apart and make 2.
1,Did not work at all!!!,"I was so disappointed in this product after such great reviews! I needed something to block out my husbands window rattling snoring! These did nothing in that regard. Also, they were so difficult to handle. The cotton left a mess on my hands and the plugs were greasy. Too bad. I was excited about these working. I ordered Flent contours instead. Lucky, I was able to return to Amazon for a full refund. This is the biggest reason I shop Amazon!"
1,Doesn't really work,"I have found that wax and silicone earplugs do not really work. The earplug will create a perfect seal, blocking out all noise; unfortunately, this creates an unbearable air pocket between the earplug and the eardrum. If you break the seal, the sound gets in..."
2,"Doesn't cut out noise, gross to handle","Needing a good pair of ear plugs, I ordered these based on the good reviews. I was sorely disappointed. After rolling them into a ball shape as instructed, there was greasy wax residue all over my hands. After inserting them in my ears, following the directions, they did not sufficiently cut out noise. I could hear my fiance snoring loud and clear, along with any other noises. I also found it a little off-putting to have to wash my hands after inserting them, and they left my ears greasy as well. Overall I do not like these at all."
2,no no,they sux. i took them on a 16hour flight. not comortable at all! all sticky like and i duno i expected more based of the reviews.
5,Very comfortable and highly functional,"These wax ear plugs are far better than the foam alternative because unlike foam ear plugs, these don't fall out of your ears when you sleep. They do an excellent job of sealing the ear canal thereby enabling a peaceful night's slumber. These are great!"
2,Didn't like it,I've worn foam ear plugs for years but i decided to try these wax ear plugs and i have to say that I didn't have a good experience. I didn't like the feel of the wax and I found that they didn't block out as much noise as the foam plugs I use now.I use the Super Leight bight orange plugs and they work good enough
5,OHROPAX RULES!,"Ohropax Wax Ear Plugs are first qualility ear plugs, incredibly soft and 100% effective against all kinds of noise! They're so gentle to your ears, sometimes you can't tell wether you're still using them or have already pulled them out!"
3,Disappointed with sound blocking ability,I read great things about how well wax plugs block sound. I have not found that to be the case although they are better than the plastic ones.
5,Awesome earplugs!!,"I absolutely love this product. We just moved from a really quiet street to what feels like the Autobahn. Our bedroom is right up against the street and it is so hard to sleep. Regular ear plugs either fall out or they hurt my ear, but these Ohropax are perfect. They are soft and come packaged with cotton around them. I find that one plug torn in two is the right size for me. They last about a week, and then they need to be changed out.They mold themselves to your ear, keeping out most sounds. The traffic sounds are hugely diminished, and I'm sleeping really well. I sleep on my side, and these haven't fallen out at all, or hurt as I lay on them. They are wonderful ear plugs! Someone mentioned how they leave your ear waxy...there is a little bit of residue, but it's gone with the sweep of a Q-tip. I find that a fair trade for the comfort and the noise blocking they provide."
4,I sleep through everything!,"The Ohropax Wax Earplugs are awesome. I've been using them for about a month on a daily basis and am still on the first set of them. They last a long time and do a wonderful job of keeping out noise. As long as they are inserted correctly into your ear, there is no pain or discomfort when sleeping in any position. It blocks out the noise from my pug who snores loudly, as well as the neighbors in the apartment complex I live in. Since I work the night shift, I have even been able to block out the sound from the neighbors cutting down trees! I love the ear plugs and will buy them again when I run out.One small thing is that they do get sticky when you soften them up but you can easily wipe off that stickiness with a towel before going to sleep."
2,Ohropax Wax Ear Plugs,"You just about have to wash hands after inserting them. They left my ears greasy,and sticky. I used them while riding my motorcycle, but half the time once I put my helmet on at least one of them would work itself loose. Had to remove helmet jam them back in and hope it would stay in for the ride home. If they stayed in great ear plugs."
3,They fall out of my ears,"No matter what I try to do, these always fall out of my ears while sleeping. That being said, I do prefer them over the foam types."
5,Best Ear plugs I have came across,"I have tried multiple earplugs, and I think we expect more noise to be canceled then it actually does. These by far, are the best I have tried. It sometimes takes a few tries to get it to mold correctly to ear, but when it does, you barely can hear anything! The Germans have done it again :)"
3,ohropax-effective but uncomfortable,"Serious sound blocking, but PAINFUL. Wax is too hard- if I roll over in my sleep it feels like someone is jabbing a finger into my eardrum. Also, my ears are sticky and oily when I wake up- not pleasant!I use silicone earplugs now. They don't block sound quite as well, but at least they don't hurt. I am a light sleeper but I also have sensitive ears so unfortunately this product doesn't quite do it for me. Glad to see that they help so many other people, though.~L"
3,Great Idea but not worth the money...,"I researched portable dvd players for my 3 yr. old's birthday. I wanted her to be able to use it in the car and anywhere else she preferred. The idea for this dvd player/carrier is great...but upon installing it in the car, the straps tore off the bag and we had to ""engineer"" it to hang from the seats. The player played fine; but I didn't think it was worth the $$$."
5,Gift,This came on time and gave for gift she loves it and tells me over and over how good it works. It comes with 2 headphones and an apparatus that allows use in the car. She loves it. I am thinking of getting another for me.
2,Didn't work very well for me,"On the surface, this package looked like quite a deal with 2 sets of headphones, a car charger and bag, etc. However, I knew that most Audiovox gear isn't exactly high-end, but I took the chance. Only about a third of the DVDs we tried played in this player. All of my DVDs are regular, store-bought, quality DVDs that play fine in multiple other players. In the Audiovox, they didn't do a thing. I don't remember the exact indication on the screen, but the bottom line is that they didn't play - at all.I returned the item for refund and will replace it some day with a more expensive, higher-quality player. I was pleased with the Amazon return process - this was my first return with them.One more thing, we bought this for our child to use while travelling, as I suspect is often the case with buyers of portable DVD players. The problem is that the included headphones don't size down small enough for a toddler's head."
4,Nice on a plane,The headphones help keep out screaming babies. The unit works just fine and the battery lasts over 2.5 hours. It's light enough to hold comfortably on your lsp if you don't want to use the meal tray on the seat.
1,Didn't work at all,"I ordered this unit on 11/29/05 for my daughter for Christmas. Received it the 1st week in Dec. Unfortunately, I left it in the box until Dec. 21st. I unpackaged it and wanted to make sure it worked before Christmas morning and guess what -- had power but would not read disk. Shipped it back the next day and went searching for a replacement. Purchased a Zenith at Best Buy. Works great so far! Lesson learned -- inspect product immediately after receiving!"
3,2 out of 4,"We bought three of these for our children's Christmas gifts. One made clicking noises as it played. Sent it back to Amazon and was sent another for replacement. The replacement played for 30 minutes and then went black. It has not worked again. Amazon will not replace an item twice. We are getting a refund and buying another item. The other two have not had any problems, but if only 2 out of 4 have worked it makes you wonder???? Good luck."
2,Doesn't last long,"Purchased in december 05 and by april 06, its not playing dvds...and of course, its past warranty, they (audiovox) wants a flat charge of $94.00 to send it in to fix. So, I will just by another brand. Be careful."
5,Exceeded our expectations,"We ordered the Audiovox D1708PK 7"" as a Christmas gift for our two year old granddaughter. It became a gift for her parents! After a surgical procedure which required an out of town trip during a winter storm, the toddler cozied up in her car seat and watched Dora as her parents watched the road.The Bonus Pack was more than you could expect. A great case that truly held all the accessories in a special zipped section and then attached to the back of the front seat to hold the player in place for safe watching. The two sets of ear phones are top quality, and are easily stored with the battery pack, car plug, and ac/dc plug.Great quality and great service. Even though I ordered late, it arrived right on schedule during the busy holiday season."
1,Terrible customer service,"I received the product quickly from Amazon, just in time for our long trip with my toddler. Unfortunately, the carrying strap for the bag was broken (the plastic clip cracked) so I called Audiovox customer service and asked them for a replacement. After being disconnected three times, transferred to their trade show department voicemail twice, and speaking to two different customer service representatives, Audiovox told me I had to pay for the replacement part, and the problem was Amazon's, not theirs. Clearly a defective product issue is theirs under their warranty, but with dreadful customer service like that I decided to return the product. I cannot speak to the performance of the product, but if I could give less than one star I would just based on my experience with their customer service."
3,Not real impressed,I guess you get what you pay for. The battery life was not good at all...I'm not even sure if I made it past 2 hours. Really disappointing since I wanted the DVD player to last on a long flight. I guess if you are not running on battery power it would serve the purpose though.
4,Two thumbs up from the two year old,"Like many we bought this in the vain attempt to keep our daughter happy during frequent flights to visit the granparents. Was a bit concerned about volume as many have discussed (daughter is not ready for headphones yet). If you sit near the engines, you will have to crank it up and thereby also giving your neighboring passengers the joy that is Blues Clues.Pretty tough machine, daughters knocked it on the floor a few times and it barely skipped a beat. Decent battery life. Now if I can just get the airlines to let her watch it the last 25 minutes of the flight so she doesn't scream to have it back ..."
1,"Only lasted one trip for me, too","Bought this because it looked like such a great deal. After reading bad reviews, I tested it before giving it to my daughter for her birthday. No problems. Used it for the first time on a flight. No problem. Changed planes, and it would not work on the second flight. Recharged battery, tried again, and the disc will not spin. Returning to Amazon because it is still within 30 day return time."
1,DON'T BUY THIS!!!,I purchased this product as a Christmas present for my son. Imagine his delight to open his gift and find his own portable DVD player! Now imagine that same delight turning to disappointment when it did not work!!! I called Amazon and they were quite helpful. They sent a replacement immediately. My son was again delighted - and again disappointed. The replacement did not work either! My best advice to you is to do yourself a favor and buy another brand.
3,Good quality for a good price,"We love the dual headphone jack and 2 pair of headphones. Only complaint is that without the headphones, the volume does not go up high enough and is hard to hear over car noise even at full volume."
5,Great Value,I purchased 2 of the DVD Bonus Packs for my nieces and were thrilled when they arrived. They were neatly packed and everything was accounted for.The Bonus Pack is a Priced Very Reasonably and if you would have purhaseditems separately you would have paid alot more $$$ than what was paidfor the Bonus Pack with all inclusive. With free shipping to boot definitely would recommend to buy.
1,Don't Buy!,"If you are attempting to purchase this item and it is being supplied by Beach Audio, DO NOT BUY IT! They received a shipment for the Mexican region and it will not play US DVD's. They do not know when they will get this problem resolved.I bought this player in April 2006 for my daughter for her 11th birthday and she is very disappointed that it doesn't work at all. While Beach Audio is giving me a full refund, I still have to go to all the trouble of returning it and locating another one."
1,Only lasted 1 trip.,"I am in the military and bought for our move from Mississippi to Virginia 2 years ago. It worked great for that trip. Soon after that the screen did not work, I used it for a while as a second dvd player because the output still worked, eventually that died too. It was never dropped or anything like that. I would not recommend purchasing."
2,Mine worked for 1 year.,"We bought this last chirstmas for the kids to watch on road trips. Worked good for them but the screen quilty is not the best. It did sometimes snag up and we would have to start the whole thing over again. Love the case it came in and all the other stuff. I would say if you are going to buy this it is a crap shot, It may work good for a long time or it may not. we found out it would cost $90 to fix our. We are investing our money somewhere else this time."
1,Sending it back... again,"I sent back the first player (which did not play at all) and got a replacement player which isn't much better. Half the time I did not get past the ""loading"" screen. The other half of the time it would play for 5-10 minutes and then fatally freeze up. I liked the bonus pack but the player itself is flimsy and would never stand up to the abuse of travel with a 3-year old."
2,What a disappointment!,"I only got to use it once and then it would not play anything else. It would power on but it would read ""No Disc"". Looks like a great deal with all it has included with it but obviously looks are deceiving."
3,Good - not great - little machine,"We bought this primarily to entertain our kids on a long drive from Mass. to Florida. It did okay - played reliably and my 11-year-old was able to follow the directions to get all the straps and buckles in place and use the case as a display stand between the front seats. It's also come in handy for me in reviewing video clips - part of my work - so that I don't have to use my computer to play video AND take notes. A couple of negatives - it doesn't remember your settings, so you have to adjust aspect ratio and brightness every time you turn it on; the controls - especially the on/off switch - aren't conveniently located or easy to use; the sound quality is pretty poor (we plugged into the car sound through the tape player) and the directions don't give a lot of detail. Otherwise - a good buy for the price."
4,audiovox portable dvd,It was shipped very quickly. I purchased it as a Christmas present and they love it!
4,Definately worth the price,"I think this works great for my daughter when we travel. She loves being able to watch her cartoons in the car. The best part is it came with everything I needed. The battery, car adapter, AC adapter, and mounting case were included. I would recommend this item."
4,"So far, so good","We bought this DVD player for our 18 month old to play ""her"" vides...12 movies later (after being handled by a toddler) it still works great. I'm happy !"
2,Poor customer service,My order was incomplete. I received no remote control with the order. Audiovox would not sent me the missing remote control because it was 40 days and not 30 days since I purchased the portable DVD player. They will make no adjustments after 30 days even if they do not sent the whole product. They would sell me a remote control for $21.75. I consider this the worst in customer service. Also if you call them you will wait on hold for 30 minutes.
2,False advertising: this is NOT ultra slim,"This portable DVD player is about 1.5"" in height, which in my book is not ""ultra slim."" Take a look at Sony's VAIO T series laptops; they are less than an inch at the thickest point, now *that* is ultra slim. This Audiovox is thick and bulky, and the 7"" screen looks awefully small even in a car."
1,audiovox,"I can not write a review on this product as product was never received, Due to poor incorrect shipping procedures. This was my 1st time in years using amazon, and my experiance has been very bad. To date the purchase price has still not been refunded to me, nor have I heard anything regarding it. I will not be using amazon again"
1,PORTABLE DVD PLAYER..... NICE & COMPACT,"THIS PLAYER IS EASY TO USE AND COMPACT.... I BOUGHT IT FOR MY SON..... THE ONLY THING HE SAID WAS DIFFERENT, BUT NOT BAD, WAS THE WAY THE BATTERY AND THE CHARGER WERE SITUATED..... WAS A LITTLE AWKWARD. BUT IT PLAYS WELL, HAS A GOOD PICTURE, AND THE SOUND IS FINE, ALSO.... A NICE LITTLE UNIT."
1,Did not work,Christmas Morning --right out of the box--did not work. I finally reached the Audiovox customer service after two days and they were clueless. I highly recommend not buying this unit.
3,Great picture but not enough sound!,This was a good value except for the fact that the volume (both through the external speakers or the headphones) is just not loud enough. My 14 and 17 year old daughters both confirmed that this unit does not have the audio output it needs. Don't expect to get enough volume to use in a moving vehicle!
4,DVD palyer,"I was not only pleased by the arrival time of this item but very empressed with the quality & all the extras it came with. the head sets are real nice, the car plug in is also a great extra so you don't have to go out & buy all the necessities, they all come with it in a real nice case. thank you."
2,Spend a little more and get a better unit,"Was nice while it worked, which wasn't long. Stopped recognizing dvd's after a few months. I've since bought an LG unit and it's a night and day difference. Cheap price for cheap junk.........so dig a little deeper and get a nicer unit."
4,Anixous to Use,After reading all the reviews that rated this product as negative I was leary to purchase. I ordered the item and received it within two business days. We plan on using it during our plane ride to Disney. I have been using it for about a week. Everything works as expected. The battery last about 2 hours. Yes it is a problem that you cannot charge and use the adapter while still viewing a DVD. I found that my JVC camcorder adapter works with this player. The instructions for the button controls are alittle to brief and leaves some questions on what is being described. Overall I would recommend this to others. One thing I saw was that his product was discontinued as of March 2007. so you better purchase soon.
1,Should have read more reviews...,"We were so excited to get this product. The price and the bonus pack were perfect. Unfortunately, we had the same problem that I now see several other reviewers had - it never worked. When you turn it on it makes a grinding/clicking sound and says ""Loading"" and then....nothing. I think the laser reader is broken. Maybe because it's completely exposed - poor design."
2,Money better spent elsewhere,"First of all our player would freeze up a lot but the worst part is the sound is horrible. The headsets were included but even with the volume all the way up you can't hear. Unless there is absolute quiet around you at all times, pay a little extra and get something better."
5,Great Traveling Machine,I love this thing it travels well and I can move it between my cars. It is soo simple to use. No frustration--YEAH!
3,Excellent reproduction of color plates and text,A small book but of good value. Very useful to see the full color plates that Blake had designed along with the text. The combination of the two increased my enjoyment of the work. The poetry is a bit obtuse and requires multiple readings to really extract what Blake was saying.
5,Good product,The capsules work much better for me than tablets or caplets. They are a little larger than a typical capsule but I've had no problem swallowing them. There is no smell or taste that I've noticed.
3,50/50 right now.,"I have been taking this for a couple weeks, and have not seen any clear benefits. It appears that most of it just gets peed out within an hour. It might not be designed well enough for body absorption."
3,Be carefree,"These may be helpful but I was advised by my Dr. not to take them They have Isititol in them which can conflict with medications. So, though they may be helpful, check with your Dr first. I have contacted Amazon, explained the situation and they are giving me a refund and I'll return them tomorrow."
5,well it's a pill right?,"well, it's just vitamin so i wouldn't know if it really works or not but Im guessing it works. haha i don't feel any big difference.."
1,Paid for new price but got a used one,"this was a great deal when I placed the order but received a used one from amazon. I can clearly see scratches and dirt all over the toy. I been a loyal customer for 5 years and couldn't believe what I got then. Anyway I didn't get a chance to play it because it was too dirty, returned it next day after unboxing."
1,Constantly stops,Fun toy but after running about 5 minutes it constantly stops responding. I have to turn the system off and turn it back on to get it to respond. It is fun to drive and my 4 year old son has a great time with it but he is constantly having to turn it off and back on to get it to work.
2,Waste of Money,"This car has a working range of about 12 feet max. Anything past that and it will not reverse, which means it cannot turn either (given the controls for turning). Really past 8 feet the car starts to lurch even going forward, on a fully charged battery. A full charge lasts about 20 minutes. Others have complained about the battery compartment, its not that bad but I did have to find a consistent system to get the batterry in/out without a flathead screwdriver (you'll already need a phillips to open the case). You'll definitely need that since you'll be charging every 20 minutes and a charge takes 4 hours. Also, its undercarriage is so low to the ground, the big, rutty tire have an actual clearance of about an inch. Seriously. It cannot climb over small thresholds, sticks, pinecones, etc. I have not tried it in water. I might do a video scathing video review if the company does not offer some type of refund. I think that if I showed you how UNfun this is, sales would be zero."
4,Awesome Ride,Bought this for my son for Christmas. He loves it. The tires are rubber and rugged allowing the car to go over many surfaces without loosing any speed. The design is awesome. It is very much worth its value. The lights look very cool (LED). It turns on a dime unlike a lot of other remote vehicles in this price range. The battery pack is way too tight in the alloted space. The wireless range could be a little bigger. I give it a 9/10.
2,"Sturdy, fun but...",I bought this for my 7 year old. Overall the this RC car is a lot of fun for outdoors driving and is virtually unbreakable.The negative is that the rechargeable battery has to taken in and out every time it has to be charged. This would not be such a problem but you have to unscrew the top and wiggle the battery in and out of a very cramped space. For a 7 year old this is a problem and I have to be around for this. Which leads to another problem; the battery has to be charged 4 hours for 20 minutes of play time. This is very cumbersome and my son has slowly lost interest due to the short playing time and the difficulty of charging the battery.Next time I would buy a 30 dollar RC car that can be charged directly with the power cord.
2,"Less durable, poor battery life",I bought this car for my 4 year old son thinking that it would be great fun for him to play. It is fun only if the battery life lasts long. The battery life is very very short. There is no point in charging for hours together for few minutes of play. The battery compartment is very difficult to deal with and it is quite hard to fix the battery into the compartment. Iam sure it will get damaged after few times of operating. Overall it is not user friendly. The car is quite heavy but the plastic with which the car is made is not that durable. My son used to get disappointed when the car won't work as the battery charging was done. And finally I had to return it off.
4,Fast and furious with a few glitches,"Great little toy. Well, not so little. This is a hefty remote car. I am finding a couple of annoyances with this car: Recharging the battery requires unscrewing a plate and recharging for 4 hours. Putting the battery back in is a bit of a pain. Sometimes it does not seem to receive the signal and just stays there. So I move the controller around a bit. This car comes with a rechargeable battery (not really clear in the description or I missed it). It's a tiger on dirt tho and fun to see how it can grab those hills. I am a 65-year-old grandmother and I bought this for my 4-year-old grandson. He likes watching me run it; it's a bit more complicated than he can handle just yet."
4,My 5 year old loves it,"After nearly a week of daily use, nothing on the car is broken! The remote antenna is a bit shorter. The range on this toy is a joke (even before the end of the controller's antenna broke off.) You can't be more than 15 feet behind this car before you can't reliably control it. The ground clearance is tiny. It could not clear a pencil laying on the ground. Those things don't seem to reduce the fun my son has with it though. The 4 wheel drive has the power and grip to climb lots of surfaces. It is controlled like a tank where the left wheels can go backwards and the right can go forwards causing an in place turn. This makes the car unique to drive (but not difficult for even young kids.) We have not tired it in water yet."
1,Cheap and poorly designed,After researching many different entry level RC cars I decided on this one and it was a big mistake. This car is poorly designed and cheaply built. Low ground clearance and weak motors cause this thing to get constantly stuck. Watch the video closely and you'll notice it's going downhill on relatively smooth terrain. The amphibious part works great as long as the water is calm because the top of the car is not sealed and water will get into the electronics. Battery life is extremely short (5-10 mins. max)The battery is also a pain to change. You don't even get full use of the battery power as once it starts getting low the remote will just stop working. I purchased this for my 5yo son who now won't play with it due to these issues. I see the price has come down(I paid $90 w/shipping).If you are looking to buy an RC car for your child spend a little more money and buy something of better quality.
3,My son hasn't used it much,My son hasn't really taken it outside to play with it so we don't know how well it performs on rough terrains. I did find it difficult to fit the battery and cable in the compartment. It took some pushing and I was concerned about damaging it.
4,great care short battery life,My 8 y/o son loves this car. He has played with it daily for the past 3 weeks. I am so glad I read the other reviews about it because they were 100% correct about the battery life. IF you purchase this car you really need to purchase a back up battery. The battery wears out very quickly. I keep one charged and replace frequently.
1,WARNING: NOT FIT FOR WATER,"This is a fun little toy for land use only! I do not recommend for water use. I bought this for my son for Christmas and within three days of mixed land and water use the unit started acting erratically and ultimately just quit working. I sent it back for a replacement. Again, within days the unit lost power in one of its two motors and only works intermittently. This time I returned the unit for a refund. When it comes to water, this product is not ready for prime-time. Until Morphibians find a way to make this toy truly amphibious, I strongly suggest spending your money elsewhere."
3,buggy,the car is pretty heavy but somehow powerfullthe batteries are not lasting for a very long timeotherwise this toy is fun
1,Not working out of the box,"The one star rating comes from the fact that my son and I have not been able to play with the car yet. I may update this review once a new car arrives, but for now, right out of the box, the vehicle does nothing. Battery is fully charged or at least I think it is; there is no indication on the charger that it is actually charging other than it gets warm. So, you have to charge the battery, per the instructions, for 5.5 hrs before first use. Not a big deal because that is typical of these types of electrical systems, however, when we plugged the battery in to the car for the first time after initial charge, the vehicle's lights came on but no movement whatsoever when the control levers were operated. Hopefully this one is a fluke and the next one will not have the same issues. One interesting thing to note is that these vehicles are no longer on the kid galaxy website, I will be asking why when I talk to customer service today to get a replacement vehicle."
1,Poor man's mystery science theater...,...and the main movie is NOT in 3D--only the host segments are shot in true 3D. Even die-hard field-sequential 3D fans should avoid.
3,"Worthwhile, if not essential, viewing","An early example of a Reese Witherspoon romantic comedy (yes, it really is!) ""S.F.W."" is not without irony, random violence, a message, and a parade of truly irritating characters. But it's all good, you know? Not a great movie by any stretch, but certainly worth watching once."
1,A Big Mess!,"I've seen this movie three times and I still don't understand it. This film is incredibly boring ( and I love Stephen Dorff! ), you'd have to to even sit through this for one minute. I like Reese too but they couldn't save this film. It flashes back and forth which is sickening. The movie itself is stifling. The flashbacks were the best part which had me wondering why the filmmakers didn't just show the hostage situation instead of making the film on the "" aftermath "" of it. Cliff Spab has to be the most boring character I've seen. He goes on and on about nothing. This character didn't showcase Stephen's true talents. All Spab did was smoke, have sex and complain about his little pathetic life yet you saw no true emotions from the guy. This movie is full of bad words, lackluster acting and nothing to show for it. Contrary to popular belief this is not Stephen's best work. If you think this you must not have seen Blade, Backbeat or The Power of One. S.F.W. sucked."
2,Forget this one.,Save your money. This is a terrible movie. I don't know what else to say about it. I can't believe that Reese Witherspoon agreed to do this movie. This is a trashy movie and not fit for children of any age.
4,Don't be fooled by the bad reviews,"To begin with, this movie is not for the dim witted. it's not for the shallow people who go through life just scratching the surface of things. There is a deeper meaning to this movie than the majority of the population can catch on to. Every word, every movement, every scene has an underlying meaning and message. thats why it's a cult classic, and why it was so hard to find for so many years (until MGM picked it up on dvd thank you!!!!!). This is one of my fav. movies, i've seen it a hundred times, and each time i find something new in it. But as i said this movie is not for the dim witted, if you can't read between the lines, your gonna be lost.Also the only reason anyone below would compare this movie to pulp fiction is because in the beginning of the movie you learn the broad picture. But they use flashbacks and cut scenes to tell the story of the hostage situation, by showing specific scenes, while cutting in and out of the present and the past."
5,I laughed and cried at this accurate portrayal of the media.,I had seen this movie for the first time on TV. It was so much better without everything being cut out of it! I loved how the movie all tied together these two lives from their most intimate thoughts to their most ultimate betrayals. The ironic ending was a touch of perfection to an already awesome movie. This is a must see for everyone especially Stephen Dorff and Reese Witherspoon fans. They were simply amazing!
2,What about Joey?,"Joey Lauren Adams, as Monica Dice, was the best thing about this movie. Her time onscreen was all too short."
1,Misleading product/ not worth the price,"Babylicious Groovy Pink Circus Stripe Basic BibThe descriptive image provided on the website shows 4 bibs, but what you get is a single ordinary bib that would cost less even at a premium price store. Certainly not worth the price. returning this item ASAP...( make that returned it within an hour of receiving it)."
5,Early Peanuts,This is a collection of reprints from THE PEANUTS daily strip from 1959-1960 (now collected in an authoritative edition:The Complete Peanuts 1959-1960). The strips appear to be reprinted out of order.
2,Very Basic Fishkeeping Information,"This book is fine for the person who has little background or experience with aquariums. The vast majority of the book is very basic information about water quality, the nitrogen cycle, choosing a tank, filter, light, substrate and plants...very general aquarium basics. It is very disappointing if you are seeking specific and/or detailed knowledge about bettas. No information at all about tail and color variations, genetics, standards, etc. A better title would be, ""Setting Up Your First Aquarium...and you can put a BETTA in there too!"""
1,Easily the worst book ever about Bettas,This is hardly a book about Bettas but as a previous reviewer noted a very basic aquarium book. As a Betta book it is so vague that it offers very little help or knowledge about Bettas' specific needs. The breeding and rearing the young section is a so vague & generalised that I really wonder if the authors have ever bred any Bettas at all. The food & feeding section is so full of errors & again vagueness that its best to ignore it. The disease treatments are mainly things that even your pet shop doesn't carry. Go to the numerous Betta sites on the web and the many Betta groups on yahoo! & you'll be far better off. Dr. Goldstein's book is light years better than this as is Walt Maurus'. Save your money for those and don't waste it on this one!
2,Not worth it,This book is a very basic book on bettas.I have been to certain betta websites on the internet that offer more information than this book does about these fish.. I do not think this is worth spending your money on i have read the book and there are still certain questions i have about bettas that it didn't answer.
3,"Good, but not great","This is a collectors item because this great group is no longer in existence. That said, my personal taste tends toward the current leading interpreters of Fado, like Mariza and my personal favorite, Mafalda Arnauth."
1,Poor quality... not worth the price!!!,"HP is selling this bag for $30 bucks, so when I found it here for $10 less I couldn't let this ""Deal"" pass me by... however when I received the bag, I wished I had... the color is less vibrant, it's cheap, poor quality, plus HP isn't embroidered on the bag... walk away from this bag and get the blue and black HP bag instead, it costs a little bit more but it's well worth it!!!"
2,um.. okay....is that it???,"so i saw that this product got 5 stars, so i ordered it......when i got it, its like ""um... is THAT it???"" it's really cute, and really well made, but it has no where to hold my usb cord or memory cards...also, there is no HP embroidered in the front like the picture has it, also, the strap that I got is really cracked and does not look good at all...other than that, it's cute, but not the best out there."
4,Compact but Stiff,"I love the size and style of this little camera bag. It's only a single compartment and the shoulder strap is nice and long. Long enough to use around the waist as a fanny pack. The bag itself isn't padded inside and it's rather stiff. A tight fit for my camera, but good protection I think. I just wanted to keep my camera from getting scratched up and this does the trick nicely."
5,Buy this long-lasting perfume that gets compliments all the time!,"I absolutely LOVE this perfume! It's a little ""spicy"", and I get compliments all the time! It lasts a long time. I just got complimented on it this evening, and I hadn't put any on since early this morning. I WISH Lomani would make it more available--I can only get it on the web. I HOPE they are not discontinuing it!! GREAT STUFF!!"
2,"Nice pictures, bad recipes","I have to agree with a previous reviewer: The layout and pictures are well done and really interesting to leaf through/look at. The recipes however, are quite bad. Really bad sometimes. I personally think that it is really hard to ruin a nice salmon fillet, but this book achieves this in 2 of their 3-4 salmon recipes - the Xmas salmon and the one right before that (haven't tried the other two). Then there are all these other recipes that are just plain weird.I am not going to burn this book as another reviewer suggested, but I will certainly keep it as a prime example of when a picture IS NOT worth a 1000 words. The authors here should really stick to photography for now and not subject anybody to their cooking until they have had more practice. A lot more."
4,Planking to Rave Reveiws....,I really enjoyed this book...different ideas and lots of great ideas to try...well worth the money
5,back to basics,"Plank Cooking opened my eyes to a new concept with the grill. My husband and I had never tried plank cooking. This book gave very clear instructions for preparing the plank and the different types of wood to use. My father ofen shares salmon with our family and I hate to admit it, but the fish is too ""fishy"" to savor. Using the plank created a whole new experience with older salmon. We savored each bite and our three boys couldn't get enough. This is an excellent book for people like me who need new ideas with the grill. Who knew you could carmalize onions with a plank on the grill? I look forward to more adventures with various types of planks. Dad, bring on the extra salmon."
3,cooking fish,"Tiffany's book introduced me to plank cooking, which I'd not done before.Some recipes worked for me. Some didn't.Despite my shortcomings as a chef, her book, overall, seems worthwhile.Wayne Heinz, author of,How to Catch Salmon, Sturgeon, Lingcod, Rockfish, and Halibut Along the Pacific Coast: Fish On!"
2,Plank Cooking disappointing,I purchased this book as a Christmas gift for my husband since plank cooking is a cooking style that we enjoy. We have been disappointed with this book. Each of the recipes that we tried was inedible and some have inconsistencies and inacuuracies in the recipes. I originally decided to purchase the book because I liked the photography and the layout and I can only hope that similar attention to detail will be added to the recipes themselves. We have now relegated this book to a new role as a fire starter.
1,It's not from Prada! Be cautious!,"I received this one today. To my surprise, it's not from Prada, but a brand named MIU MIU. It's totally a mistake."
1,****EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING***,"I really don't know what to say. I have NEVER given a book a 1 star review. I have every single book Ms Simmons has written and a fair amount are on my keeper shelf. Agree with the other reviewer about the DeBurgh series(on keeper shelf) and her other books. They were ""can't put it down kind of books"" and loved them, so was looking forward to this book. I don't remember being so disappointed in a book before, know I probably have, but after her other ones, was surprised. I did some skimming and had a very hard time finishing it. I am the type reader, that once I start a book I have to at least give it the benefit of the doubt and finish it, no matter how hard it is. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK AT ALL."
4,Silk Design,"I use it almost daily, and I like it. It's light and provides a natural shine to my hair."
3,They keep getting better,"Vampire Sisters is third in a sequence of collaboration between Joe Ripple and Don Dohler, starting with Harvesters and then Stakes. As a low budget indie, this movie is really good. It's sexy, bloody, scary, ....But, the highlight to me is the closing sequence (under the credits) which I believe is outstanding even by big budget standards. I won't spoil it by describing it here. It's just completely great - although you need to have seen at least the start of the movie to get the full impact. It's one of the most masterful pieces of video and audio editing I've ever seen."
4,Touched By Evil a must for all Paula fans,Some people say Paula's acting was not great in this movie but I found her totally believable. The only thing that kept this from being 5 stars was the rather poor script and dialogue. You wouldn't think being based on a true story writing a good script would be as hard as starting from scratch but you'd be wrong... Paula and the supporting cast manage to make this well worth the price despite the material they had to work with.
2,WHY SHE GAVE UP ACTING,"After viewing Paula Abdul's amateurish performance in this made for TV movie, one can see why she didn't have a very long acting career. Even her buddy Simon Callow would have to agree. Supposedly based on ""actual events,"" this lethargic movie gives us Abdul as a rape victim trying to get her life back together. She's a business entrepreneur who wants to invest her hundred thousand dollars into some kind of business. She is guided by her business manager, Susan Ruttan, whose performance belies the fact that she was Emmy nominated when on LA LAW. She also befriends a cute condo neighbor, played by Tracy Nelson. Life takes a good turn .. or does it when she meets handsome car detailer Adrian Pasdar, who may just be the man to help her shake her fear and terror. A 12 year old can see the obvious in this okay little thriller, but it's only Pasdar in his role that brings any sense of credibility to the movie."
4,Drinking bird fun,I ordered the drinking bird for my young son: he likes it a lot and it reminds me of my childhood.
4,Just like I remember it from my childhood,Product arrived in great condition and works as advertised. My kids are fascinated by it and it is a great educational tool for demonstrating how cooling causes air to become more dense and create a vacuum.It is made of glass and the contents will stain so it isn't for little kids to use unsupervised.
4,Drinking Bird Novelty Toy,I bought this for my sister-in-law who remembered these from her childhood. It is a great conversation-starter and is entertaining to watch.
3,looks cheap,"it's a cute ornament, but looks cheaply made and the hair is really wild looking.worth the price for an ornament."
2,Dissapointing performance,This smart and beautiful music for solo violin deserves a better performance. I don't like the weak projection and thevery tiny sound of Manze. Occasionaly there are too wide volume differences between the tracks. Clearly Manze has admirers. I am not one of them.
2,scraping the surface,"Andrew Manze's playing, hailed by petty music critics all over the world as witty and brilliant, blah blah blah, certainly falls flat here. Yes, he's got chops, and he's made it his admirable quest to record everything under the sun, but these beatiful and fun (yes, fun!) Fantasias are rich with rhetorical sentiment, and Manze breezes mechanically and monotonously. If you're a Manze fan already, of course you're going to love this CD. You'll also love it if you have no idea what ""rhetorical sentiment"" is. However, if you know anything about early music or prefer other things to eat besides vanilla pudding, you may not want to waste your money. I wish one day we could live in a world where recording companies record good music, not just flashy names."
4,Revealing,"It took me almost two months to finish this tome but it was worth it. Not only do I now have a clearer understanding of the way the glbt community is treated in the courts, I better understand the legal system in general."
3,No Way Out 03,"1. Chris Jericho vs Jeff Hardy: I personally thought this was 2nd best match of the night. Great mhigh flying and techinical wrestling. Jeff Hardy is an amazing athelete and proves it in this match, he was the perfect opponent for Jericho. 9/102. World Tag Team Championship: Kane and RVD vs Storm and Regal: Decent, but the usual from theese 4.

4,Is it theatre?,"This play brings up a number of issues of media control of public opinion in North America. It's good to see examples of Canadian, not just U.S terrorisim in international development. But is it theatre? The format says no, but what is theatre? If theatre is artistic expression outside of corporate sponsored media then yes. Contraversial in more then one way, the authors say a lot of things that they would not get away with on T.V or radio making the stage a new forum for expression. It is easy to read and makes you think (shame on Brooks and Verdecchia)."
2,Drab,"Alleged comedy that isn't funny; purported wit that isn't witty. In addition, British accents make the dialogue difficult to understand. If there were anything good to say about this film, I would say it."
3,disappointed there was not more santeria,"I found the video on a search for ""Santeria"", it was only a very brief part of the video. Nice overview of general cuban culture, I liked the style but would have enjoyed more details."
2,useless,it came in a big box. then the box is hard to open. it can't even form a proper box. it was ridiculous all around. i prefer the carriers or a better box maker.
2,Wasn't Impressed,"I thought far too much of the book was used discussing how male dominated the work force is. I would not have bought the book if I knew a good part of it was about white males being favored in the work force, because I know that isn't my problem. I rated it 2 stars instead of 1 star because there were some useful parts of the book unrelated to favoring white males. I learned some ways to better stand up for myself and reword my requests so I sound stronger. Although there were some good points, overall the book was too feminist for me (even though of course I'm for women's rights, that's just not the problem I'm dealing with right now), and a little too anti white male (my white husband is currently my best support system). I thought the author Lois P. Frankel wrote about some controversial issues that didn't need to be included in this book, such as when she suggested that readers join a group supporting a women's right to choose."
5,Magical. These short films will captivate you.,"I remember seeing Bearskin on PBS as a child. It is solely responsible for my lifelong love of Grimm's fairy tales. Davenport's interpretation of these classic tales is bar none, the best I have ever seen."

2,Felix's singing is horrible.,"Of course, Gens is her usual brilliant self and everyone apart from Felix seems to be in good form. I was so disheartened by what I heard from Felix, I searched out the Gramophone Magazine review, and their reviewer was aghast too, saying the man is quite simply out of tune.Hearing is believing."
4,"Not Professional, but Alright","I don't want to spend the money on professional grade markers, and these guys allow me to work on a few projects without breaking the bank. They pale in comparison to professional pen sets, but what can you do?"
4,sharpies,Came just as advertised. Shipping was quick. I have always wanted to buy a set like this for a long time. i am so glad that I did!
5,Great buy.,"The shipper had excellent timing, and the description was perfect. I will buy from them again. It was a good expereince."
5,Fine-tip Sharpies,"I bought this for a friend in a nursing home. She hand-makes greeting cards and these were exactly what she needed for a new project (wanted lots of different colors). It was easy to order them for her, they weren't expensive and they made her so happy. I'd say this purchase was a hit."
4,Good markers,I used this all the time. The color are very vibrant and they last a really long time. No complaint here
1,Bait and Switch ! ! !,"My rating is more about AMAZON than the product. I ordered a set of Sharpie Fine Point Markers 24 pack, that were $10.00. They sent me ""80's GLAM"". It was NOT 80's GLAM that I ordered! I'm sure the product is fine, colors aren't what I wanted, AMAZON pulled a fast one. I would NEVER order ANYTHING listed as ""80's GLAM"". Shame on AMAZON for doing this."
3,Not up to the set standard,"While I must admit I had never heard Midfield General, I was VERY pleased by the previous two Boutique efforts, so I thought I would give it a try.Unfortunately there is something missing. A few things I noticed were the slow start, It finally gets going around track 4 (Mulder who cut his teeth with the likes of Aprhodite) and then seems to hold an even, if not spectacular, pitch up until track 10 when things really start to pick up (LFO). THings run along great until the last two 60's pop songs (which seem to be a nice tradition on the other two, but feel more like padding here).Overall a good disk with lots of to be expected big bass noise, but as you may notice with the brevity of this review it does not live up to the reputation of the first two fantastic disks."
3,not John Wayne's finest hour,"Some of the shots in this movie are ""reused"" footage from otherfilms ( 1926 Ken Maynard film) and the have him playing harmonica ( like the otherfake singing cowboy movie).I love John Wayne westerns, but his studio kind of misused himin several of his early films. Here his side kick Frank McHugh, Yakima Canuttand the wonder horse Duke get almost as much billing as he does.I liked the movie which I hadn't seen beforeand the history of transcontinental telegraphis probably important."
5,Learn from the master himself!,"Swami Rama teaches the mediation techniques that are taught in Himalayan Tradition over 5000 years by sages living cave monasteries. This is the best book on meditation, period.You may also want to buy Swami Jnaneshvara Bharati's ""basic mediation"" CD (or MP3) as a companion for this book. Book and CD go hand in hand. Please also visit swamij[dot]com website for more details on yogic practices as taught in Himlayan Tradition."
5,Great Book,Good book. Gives good and usefull information. Still reading it..But it feels like a book you can read over and over again and still find new things in it.
3,Usability,"The case will barely hold the camera with mounted lens and one extra lens. The various pockets will hold small items, but the overall size limits the number of items that can be carried."
3,Olympus camera case,Case is a good size but the female part of the fastener clip (the part that comes off the strap coming up from the bottom of the case) slipped off the strap and will not stay on!
3,OLYMPUS CASE TRAVEL E SYSTEM,"GOOD BAG FOR THE SMALLER E-SYSTEM CAMERAS. JUST RECENTLY PURCHASED A 150MM LENSES,NOT ENOUGHT ROOM TO CARRY OTHER ACCESSORIES. STILL IT WAS A GOOD PURCHASE. BAG IS WELL CONSTRUCTED."
2,Poor quality for the price,"The bag is quite poor quality for the price; I expected something more decent. Fabric is cheap quality and the closure clip is cheap plastic, looks like it will be broken pretty soon. Holds just the camera + 1 extra lense, no room for flash or additional lenses. $49.99 initial price? pff.."
4,Nice gift,Gave these to my sister-in-law from her wish list at Christmas. She loves them and uses them in her kitchen. Nice quality.
3,too weird to pass up,"I found this not too long ago & when I saw it was a kid's movie that had Christopher Lee in it, I thought it too strange to just pass up. It puts me in mind of a 60's style British boy's school movie, with lots of typical things that schoolboys get up to, etc. Kind of fun, but really not my thing.I have to wonder about the people complaining about the quality of the DVD on this though...looked fine to me...it's from the Televista/Substance/Jef Video gang, and I do own many of those,but as their quality goes, it's not bad at all. They can be pretty hit or miss with quality, but this seems to be one of the better ones...maybe I'm just not [...] enough. 3 out of 5 stars."
5,Recommend to children and famililies with open mind......,"This movie is the cream of the crop,it is what I had expected and should not be Americanize. It's just a truly brilliant movie and the children are cute too."
4,A great read,Well this is the way I see it. I usually do not read books. I think the last time I read a book from cover to cover was 7 years ago. This book had my attention from page one and I could not wait until the moment I had time to pick it up again. I just hope that the author comes out with another novel. In my opinion he did a great job.
3,Didn't go the distance,"Gripping early, lost traction towards the end.Good premise, nice segues between the present and the past to make you feel more involved with the Templars.Characters had depth and the interaction was good.The story seemed to reach a climax too early, followed by action sequences which appeared to be included to lengthen the book more then to continue the plot."
1,Nancy Drew vs Harlequin Romance,"If you want to read a romance ..... I did not... Would be appropriate for a 11 to 14 young female teenager...not for big people, unless you are wanting a ""tender love story"".."
2,The Last Templar,"A knock-off in style from Dan Brown's book. The same short chapters and character interplay with less excitement and suspense. The book starts off well but about half way through it ends up jumping into the purely unbelieveable. Where Mr. Brown had enough suspense and realism to keep the reader turning pages, Mr. Khoury's story is an occassional read with the book being put down often. Interesting premise but the detail, the realism, and all that makes Mr. Brown's story excellent is missing."
1,"No more DaVinci Code wannabeez, pleeze!","I picked up this book initially because of interest in the Templars, but was disappointed on several fronts. First of all, much of the writing is poorly edited and wooden (excepting action scenes, which sizzle even though they might smell of unliklihood). However, my primary complaint is the tone assumed in this fictional tract's denial of the foundation of Orthodox Christianity: the heroine's ultimately condescending pity/compassion for the believing masses. What a godawful puke of a final motivating sentiment!"
2,Great Beginning,"This book has one of the best opening scenes that I have ever read. Unfortunately it goes down hill rapidly from there. One reviewer said first third great, last third bad. I fully concur. In reading this one realizes how good Angels and Demons and the DaVinci Code really are."
2,Just not that good,"Was really excited to read this book, but it was just a rather disappointing read. The hype is not justified and the ending is awful."
2,I Want My Time Back,"I did not enjoy this book overall. It started off decently but quickly went downhill, the problem is that I'd invested too much time to just stop reading it so I thought I'd just breeze through it. Wish I had just stopped while I was ahead. The characters are all flat and annoying with no depth. The plot was the most elementary one in the book. The mid section was pretty atrocious, it turned into nothing more than a dull history textbook, the author didn't even bother to craft his history lessons in uniquely. The ending was so empty and cliche, I just wanted to get through it at that point. I very rarely buy mass crime/religious fiction like this, and now I remember why. It also got way too religious, skip this one."
2,The first 100 pages...,"This book started off with a bang, even if it was an unbelievable one (knights who ride horses into a museum in the middle of NYC?), but unfortunately it went down hill from there. It just kinda ran out of steam for me, mired in people and chapters jumping around, until by page 100 the book had found itself in the worst place a book could be in my house...underneath the bed. It hung around there for a few days (weeks) while I tried to screw up enough courage to plow on, but alas, the last templar has found it's way down to the cardboard box in the basement marked ""Goodwill."""
3,Exciting opening,"After watching the made for television movie based on this book, all I can say is that this one of the few times a movie is better than the book!Indiana Jones, in female form, meets the Davinci Code and clashes with the Vatican and an obsessed scholar, finds love and romance and saves the world from the destruction of Christianity. How can you that!?"
4,A good page-turner that could have been better,"Written in a style obviously derived from the likes of Clive Cussler, James Patterson, and Dan Brown, this novel opens with a bang and then downshifts into a plodding detective story that struggles to keep the reader's attention for the next 100 pages or so before picking up the pace in a big way with non-stop action and plot twists until the author seems to write himself into a corner, from which he opts to escape by employing an ambiguous ending. Still, the author manages to insert some interesting theological and existential questions into an otherwise mindless thriller. Not bad for a first novel. I'll be interested to see what he comes up with in the future."
1,What a waste of money,"Don't you just hate wasting money and more importantly time? The book started out OK but quickly devolved into a predictable heap of garbage. You can tell the author has written for TV, apparently this was a script that did not get approved for even basic cable. The ending is so contrived and predictable it was like being punched in the stomach. I feel cheated."
2,Poor ending to a decent novel,The novel started with some character development and ended with character assassination. It was an obvious rush to publish. I would not recommend it.
2,Big Disappointment!!,"This story started off well and it kept me interested most of the way until the big let down at the end. When I got to the last chapter I honestly have to say ""WTF"". This story builds up to an exciting climax only to arrive at total disappointment. It's like getting caught jerking off in the shower by your mom."
2,Didn't do it for me,"Well, I think Raymond Khoury came up short with this one. He does a nice job of grabbing you in the beginning and actually does a nice job of setting up a great story/setting/characters. As a fan of Dan Brown, I was looking for a nice thriller. This book just didn't thrill. The pace was too slow and I couldn't keep reading after about 2/3 of the way. Disappointing."
1,Waste of your time!!!,"The overall story is probably worth 3-4 stars BUT the ending is so utterly ridiculous it makes you feel like an idiot for wasting your time reading the previous pages! The final act of one of the main characters is so utterly absurd that I threw the book across the room. If you decide to read this book, do yourself a favor and rip out the last few pages and write your own ending!"
2,"The ending really makes me angry, I feel like I wasted my time.","The beginning and the body of the story are riveting, but the ending left me extremely disappointed. After investing the time to read the entire book I was really let down by the actions of the main characters. The only way that the end could have been more disrespectful to the readers was if Tess and Sean had sex on top of a pile of science books. I was honestly wishing that Tess had thrown herself off of the cliff instead of the journal. She was an annoying character throughout the book, but especially so at the very end. She didn't have to present the document to the world, but she should not have destroyed it. What is the author's fascination with the glorification of empowered women who make poor decisions anyhow?"
2,"entertaining, but...","this book is entertaining. story moves fast, but has includes flashbacks to the 13th century which i didnt really enjoy. there's a twist or two in the book, which is expected.i would have given this book 3 stars if it wasnt for the ending. seriously, if you've ever watched a ""goodguy vs badguy"" adventure on television, the ending wont surprise you."
2,Great premise poorly executed.,"Every character in this novel is one dimensional, and the ""romance"" between two of them is ludicrous. Expository that runs on for pages at a time, while very enlightening, interrupts the flow of the ""story,"" such as it is.In all, a grand disappointment."
2,Disappointing,"Bought the book on the premise. It felt like a total rip of the Da Vinci Code. It was highly predictable, thus boring. Don't waste your time and money."
2,"fast start, slow middle, silly ending","Very engaging, fast paced, and ingenious - but only at first. Things go slower and slower as the author struggles to paste together a romance and, unfortunately, the plot also becomes more and more unbelievable. It turns into one of those books where the main characters are so foolish you stop caring what happens to them. And after all that, the ending is just plain silly.If you are a die-hard medieval conspiracy theory fan you might like this book. But if you are looking for good writing, solid plotting, and believable characters, read something else."
2,"An okay novel, but lacking in meat","Like other reviews I read here, I also purchased this book based on the premise that it would be written in the same vein as The DaVinci Code and provide more historical background on the Knights Templar. Unfortunately, that was not the case. It was a fair and often entertaining read, especially at the beginning, but did not have enough ""meat"" to back up its ""historical"" premise. I will not spoil it for those who want to read the book, but in the end, I was disappointed and simply left wondering about the author's true agenda."
1,Silly book; don't waste your time,Began with an interesting premise and faded out about half way through. The book advances the stereotypical views of liberal Hollywood regarding Christianity.
1,Unbelievable,"Notwithstanding that this book somewhat obviously was penned to ride the coattails of The DaVinci Code, I did enjoy the beginning. The museum raid was enjoyable high concept. However, this is one of those rare books that I just could not finish. The characters simply did not act rationally -- it was a case of plot necessities all-too-obviously driving actions the characters took, rather than the characters' actions empowering the plot. Any story can be written when the characters' actions make no sense, but such stories do not necessarily deserve to be published."
2,Okay but not as good as I had hoped,"While I loved the beginning chapter and the imagery of Knights in Armor robbing the Metropolitan Museum it soon became trite. There was the obligatory Catholic Priest who assassinates all those who might present a threat to the Church. Then we have the troubled FBI Agent who has his faith tested, and of course the beautiful, highly intelligent, archaeologist who captures his attention. The whole premise of a Gospel of Jesus shows a lack of knowledge of the time period of Christ's life. Very few people could even read in those days, and everything was written by hand using very expensive materials. This book managed to pass the time for me in a somewhat enjoyable manner but could have been much better."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"Despite a great beginning, the book soon becomes a run of the mill novel on grand conspiracy theories and the ""evil"" church. The plot has potential and could have been great in the hands of a better writer. Even Clive Custler could have made this one a rip snorter Dirk Pitt adventure. Khoury fails. I skimmed the last 50 pages just to get it over with. Very disappointing."
2,Same old same old,"Structured like a Clive Cussler novel, with its repeated flashbacks, and a thinly veiled homage to Nelson DeMille's normal cast of characters -- tough New York FBI agent/cop; stunning, divorced damsel and daughter; colorful background characters who offer history lessons -- this turned out to be a book that I found just too easy to put down. Predictable, capitalizing on the Da Vinci code genre, unengaging, and cardboard characters. Some action but little suspense or ability to identify with the characters. Pass."
3,Great start......fizzle finish,"I waited over 3 months on my library's waiting list for this book and I was really excited and looking forward to it when my turn to read it finally arrived.As other here have said, this book starts out really good. It's fast paced and very interesting then it hits a wall.In a way I'm glad to see from other reviews here I'm not the only one that felt letdown by The Last Templar, but I'm really disappointed that from the time Tess heads for Turkey where you'd expect a lot of action, the story loses steam and I can't understand why it left me feeling that way? I struggled to read the final 1/3 of this book."
3,"Good first outing, Bandwagon story","A great story, especially for a first novel. The story flows well, though it gets a little thin in places. The premise is a bit disappointing, though, with the same weak attempt to discredit the church. Dan Brown did a great job but still fell a bit short. This does no better. Both were a bit of a reach.All in all a good read, but quite fictional."
3,A good read...but...,"I think Mr. Khoury has done a fine job on his first novel. The story is compelling, and the characters are believable. However, I feel the plot is a little forced, and feels - well, like a screenplay. The novel format allows the author to explore a lot more than a movie, and I think a lot of opportunities existed to do just that.The most obvious ""force"" is in the sheer number of ""co-inky-dinks"" that the plot goes through. I knew, pages ahead, where some of this was going. That is not to say it wasn't enjoyable; they were the RIGHT plat twists, I just felt they could be developed a little better.All in all - I recommend this book. And I recommend Mr. Khoury keep writing. There is a lot of novel-talent in there, and I look forward to the next one."
3,3.5 really. . . . worth reading,"I tried to open this book with out any expectations, with out comparing it to other Jesus-conspiracies. The story is fast paced - it got off to a quick start, and I liked the METRAID - interesting idea. The characters were trite and flat,in general: of course, this wasn't a character driven story. Their dialog left a lot to be desired, but clever dialog is exceptionally difficult to write. The general plot was well developed and interesting, I thought the flashbacks were a nice touch. For those who have compared this to DVC, shame on you. This is simply another hypothesis of why the Vatican turned on the Templars after they became powerful and wealthy. What secrets did they hold? I thought Khoury's version of the Templars ""big secret"" was mundane, almost so much so that it was anitclimatic... he really didn't come up with some amazing fresh idea. But that's ok, it was still the sort that would have chnaged the world should it come to light. A good read."
2,...but not the last novel,"""The Last Templar"" is pleasant as a police novel, but with an expected plot and end: there are, as usual, the clever girl, the good and the bad guys. If we take out the Templar touch, it becomes just a novel (well-written, but obviously according to a technique). Let's add some interesting historical information and we are done."
2,Religion Explained on a High School Level,"The book is a light and airy read, with enough action to keep one going to the end, and the Templar passages are intriguing. But just for once it would be nice to read an author who has a better grasp on religion than your average precocious high school senior. Please, the Enlightenment took place 300 years ago - could someone let Mr. Khoury know that there is a whole world of theology out there that fills the void between blind faith and blind science. The book would be immensely better without its poor attempts to insert religious philosophies - well, except that then it would not have much of a plot at all."
1,Jumping on the bandwagon,"Such a dissapointing book!!! The plot seemed transparant from the off and the characters just seemed unbelivable. The book seemed to want to cause controvesy without actually offending anybody it was just weak. The story, plot and writing were like a secondary school essay not something that I expect in a bestseller. It read like the author was just wanting a large pay cheque when the film rights come through. Just dont read it!!!"
3,Worth a read...,"If you have read a good number of mystery thrillers you won't really be suprised by any plot twists or intrigued by unique and interesting characters. But on that note, if you're a fan of the genre, you'll get some enjoyment out of it.Fear not, people of faith. Its just a novel and doesn't make the pretense that it is uncovering a ""real-life"" conspiracy in the pages of a novel.Also, just a pet peeve the author seems to use Christianity interchangeably with Roman Catholicism. I supopose an effort to make a distinction would bog down the book a bit."
2,"If this is the ""Last Templar"" than it is a good thing","Story starts out well but then gets sloppy, too long winded, too many extraordinary circumstances and an unsatisfying ending. While I liked the discussion surrounding the protagonists' inner conflicts about revealing the Templar ""secret"", there was too much exposition and not enough evil attributed to the professor who starts the chain reaction and is eventually defeated at the end. As it was, I felt sorry for the bloke rather than relieved at his death and in suspense books, aren't we supposed to rejoice at the demise of the protagonists' enemies?"
1,Waste of time,"I agree with a few of the other reviews. The first few chapters are very promising. The last few are a complete bore. This is the ""poor man's"" Da Vinci Code. Very uninteresting. One of the worst. At sometimes it was completely predictable. Other times I knew more than the characters did."
3,Just doesnt' make the cut.,the book just doesn't make the cut. you can't help comparing it to similar books from the same genre... da vinci code etc. the end is just absolutely dumb and it just not puzzling enough.
1,Horrible,"This was one of the worst books I have ever read. The author shows little imagination in developing the plot and the characters. The story starts off quick and exciting and then it tailspins into a black hole. Do everyone a favor, collect all these books and destroy them, so nobody has to be tortured by reading it."
2,and the Greek Tragedy is saved by the Chariots of the Gods....,"At least the Greeks invented a way to whisk in and save face for the Author, when the basket ball during playoffs begins to deflate. This book started off with so much mystery, intrique, and on and on. And that carried for quite awhile until it comes down to...believer vs. nonbeliever with so many of the same o same o. Arguments basically of 'can you see it' or 'is it faith'. At one point I also became confused as to which original Templars were the focus of the historical view, and down hill from there. And the Coup de Grace'....leave the evidence alone. Don't peek. I was disappointed, and for the first time in a long time I wanted to fling the book. Weak. Wasn't worth my effort."
3,Just Ok,"The book started off really strong and fast. I was really interested in the concept that Jesus wrote a book in the Bible stating that he was human not Son of God and the Vatican wanted to destroy it. However, the book in the middle somehow got lost. It got bogged down in some very farfetched plot devices that won't even make sense in a movie. This book was written first as a screenplay then turned into a book when the author decided it would be better to market the book that way. I didn't like the use of flashbacks to tell us the story of the Templars' letters. I would have rather just read them and been done with that. I was just let down with the whole last part of the book. You can seriously tell that this author wanted a movie out of it. It could have been an excellent book."
1,"Bad, bad, bad","Don't waste your money like I did! Where to start? ...how about all of the Catholic-bashing that goes on, the author is not a religion hater, this we know b/c he actually seems to legitimize the Muslim prophet, while bashing everything that Christianity is based on. Plausability is lacking in everything from the ""CIA-cleric"" to the absurd romance between Tess & the FBI guy, who can't bring himself to date anyone because he is the product of a Dad who committed suicide...(I guess I missed the psychological link here!) The author figures he doesn't have to give a plausible story...any old story will do. People survive unsurvivable situations without the least bit of modern medical assistance. I would never buy anything from this author again."
2,The Last Templar,"This book was obviously written to capitalize on the Templar craze that followed the release of The DaVinci Code, and it fails mightily. The reader experiences no connection to the characters, and the prose is boring."
2,The Da Vinci Code Pt. 2,"Initially I found this book interesting and a decent read at first, but as the book wore on, it became apparent that its not much beyond a cheap Da Vinci Code knockoff. The characters are weak, feel a littl forced, and the plot feels like a Choose Your Own Adventure fill in the blanks device. Its like having deja vu; I kept asking myself 'Haven't I read this before?' Additionally, the ending is a huge, lame disappointment that sacrifaces the search for truth for a willful delusion."
1,Now I know why Hollywood makes such terrible movies!!,"As many of the Amazon reviewers noted -- the book starts out well then goes into stock characters, juvenile logic, improbable dialogue, and clichéd action. Examples abound: FBI agent with issues, female ""hero"" with newly found James Bond agility and strength, ""hero"" who won't confide in police/FBI because of a daughter, villain turning to crime because of Catholic tenets, etc. Bought it thinking it would break new ground on the Templars, but it just became a rework of DaVinci Code.Two thoughts crossed my mind as I threw this book away. First, I now understand why Hollywood uses hackneyed scripts -- the screenwriters have very few fresh ideas. Second, I guess this ""novel"" received good reviews because the story aligns with the elite critics' worldview.One of only a few books I have quit reading, and thrown in the garbage can. This ""novel"" would make a great send-up parody in the Airplane-line of comedy. Stay clear of this ""novel""!"
2,Disappointing,"In spite of the well-written first half of the book, this novel becomes predictable and agenda-driven, rather than developing an exciting climax - although the author did try to do so. I was not engaged in the last quarter of the book and simply scanned to get to the end, especially the preachy parts concerning Christianity. It has all been done before."
2,From Potential to Bad,"I have never written a review of a book, game or movie but I feel compelled to write this. I must loudly echo the majority of reviews of this book. The Last Templar had a great deal of potential at the beginning of the book. It was exciting, good premise and potentially strong characters. However, after the first strong 74 pages or so, it progressively began its downward spiral into c*&p. Please, be careful when deciding what book to read next as I do not recommend this book. P.S. - the 2 stars are for the beginning of the book."
2,a disappointment,"It is a great opening scene, with four horsemen, dressed as Templars, riding their horses up the stairs of the MoMa. But from there the fast paced action rather leaves you hungry for more substance. An archaeologist joins forces with an FBI agent, they go traipsing around the globe searching for the reason ""why"" and of course it all ties in with the Catholic Church and its history... In a similar vein to all those Da Vinci Code wannabes Raymond Khoury managed to keep the pace fast enough that I finished the book before realizing there was something missing. In a review I noticed that Raymond Khoury is a screenwriter and it definitely shows... this is one book where I would probably prefer the on-screen version."
3,Who Stops For a SEX scene while looking for holy grail????,"I really liked the fast pace of this book until about page 300. For heaven's sake---the author ruined the story with a sex scene the night before what was supposed to be the finding of what they have been looking for and what the book was leading up to. I hated the ending, i actually really hated this book after pg. 300. if you want action and adventure and a thriller type book- try reading angels and demons or davinci code or deception point all by dan brown."
2,Definitely reads like a straight-to-video movie,"This certainly isn't the worst novel I've read recently (I read another supposed historical thriller before this one that takes that title) but it's not very good.The plot is interesting. It had the potential to be a decent genre novel, but from the start I was troubled by the just plain basic lack of writing skill of the author. The characters are all pretty shallow and cliché and the dialog is pretty mediocre.I kind of had to force myself to finish the novel, but I'll admit by the very end, I was actually drawn in enough to enjoy it.From this novel, I would surmise that plot is Khoury's strength, but he needs to work on the many other aspects of the craft of writing. If he can do this, I think he could become an enjoyable writer."
3,The Last Templar - A book worthy of reading,"I happened to pick this book up on a whim in the adult fiction section of my local library. Khoury's style and subject matter are very similar to author Dan Brown. For example the chapters are short and written with a dialect young adult readers can enjoy.Just to say something critical, more often than not the story line was predictable. But I found it a good read that most people would enjoy."
3,"Ok, if there is nothing else to read","As others noted, the characters are shallow and the language is foul. Several suspense writers do not use foul language and still get the point across about a rogue or evil character. Again, the Catholic Church is assaulted and the book is peppered with one-sided atheist, ""intelligentsia"" suppositions; and to be expected the Christian or Catholic character in this case ""defender"" is already conflicted about his 'faith' and has no answers or rebuttals to the intelligent professor character. This leads me to believe the author has no Christian friends or they are weak in apologetics. When writing a book to challenge millennia of faith and fact, one should get both sides of the story. If you have nothing else to read, try it. That is what happened to me. I finished a good book and then rummaged through a home library where I was staying. I do have to say, the ending was surprising and the author gained some `redemption."""
3,SPIRITUAL BELIEF UPHEAVAL!,"First novel and good try. Exciting at first - heavy in the middle - good religious research into Jews and Christians. The ""theory"" of the book gives a christian a hard ride into thought - and if your faith is strong you can ride out the spiritual crisis and discover all is well with your soul. I am not sorry I read it and would try another of his efforts. Give it a try - it's literature and a journey."
2,Dissappointing,"Found this text to be poorly contrived and written. Holes throughout the book. Example (spoiler alert)... 2 protagonists reach a remote damn in Turkey, miraculously find and don some diving gear and dive to the bottom of a murky lake. They recover hidden artifacts burried deep in a sealed grave in ruins of a medieval church under (guessing) 100 feet of water. All this is done in a little over a couple of hours. Believable? Nope. A lot of anti-Christian overtones. Uses story line to dismiss cannon Gospels through allusion to the gnostic Gospels without ever discussing the Pauline portion of the New Testament. Glad I listened to it via audiobook while mowing my lawn. Did not miss much because even with the noise."
2,Wait for the DVD...,"I got this book based on the premise and was initially engaged. Early on, the action moved briskly enough that I was willing to overlook its faults: The prose was flowery and cliched, the characters a little one-dimensional. Think of the genre featuring the 'brilliant, beautiful headstrong ' and you've got it down pat.Not surprisingly, there's also the 'gifted-but-haunted-by-past-demons' FBI agent' and the associated cast of stock characters.Of course, nobody acts remotely like a real person and a series of unrealistic actions mixed with coincidences keep them all moving toward the inevitable conclusion.That said, I initially enjoyed it in spite of it faults and found it well paced. Eventually, though, it bogs down in a love story and its need to connect the dots with lengthy historical backstory.I wish I'd liked it better..."
1,Deplorable Writing,Beginning with Chapter 1 this book is poorly written and edited. I'm very surprised that it was published by the New American Library given it contained numerous grammatical errors and amateurish sentences. I stopped reading after Chapter 2.The Last Templar
1,Lowest common denominator,"This book starts off interesting but quickly devolves into a horrid mess. The characters are very one dimensional and the plot leaves you with too many ""Ya, right.."" moments. It really looks like a ""written for TV"" type book with it's plot and way too predictable ending. Save your cash."
2,"High Expectations, quiet results","The Last Templar: I had high expectations when I started listening to this unabridged audio book by Raymond Khoury. The book opens with a set of events set in the days of the Templar knights. Then jumps to modern day New York. As the story evolves, it weaves the historical story with the modern day search for a stolen Templar artifact. The search for the artifact is mostly a detective story with a serious bad-guy having stolen the artifact.The characters are well developed and interesting. The historical story line is interesting, but, the today's story line is a typical detective novel. I would say the ending was a bit disappointing; a quiet ending rather than a bolder result.Yes, the book is interesting, but, I would suggest there are other books that are more powerful and interesting. You can skip this one."
1,Waste of time,"I kept reading hoping that the book would somehow make a ""turn"" for the better, and become worth reading. Never happened, and I am upset I wasted the time with it. Clearly, a knock-off. It is a shallow love/action story with a dash of ""holy grail"" lore thrown in."
1,There Ain't No Justice,"I haven't read other reviews so I may be repeating what others have said. This book was by far one of the worst-written I have ever read. It absolutely fries me that it became a best-seller. I can only credit this to the author's success at capitalizing on Da Vinci Code Fever. The plot is hackneyed and the resolution infantile. The characters are of the sort one daydreams about when imagining writing a book. But the writing itself is this book's most amateurish feature. The passive voice is used throughout. Almost all the action takes place in the recent past, tied to a character's reflection with the overused word ""had"". Colorful verbs and adjectives are far overused. I have to assume that it comes across much, much better in translation, because then it will have passed through an editing process. This author relied too much on his thesaurus and evidently was not introduced to an editor; or if he was, that editor should be fired."
1,waste of time,"I already did not like the book by the time I finished the first fifty pages, the characters were horrible - cliche after cliche - seriously read like the makings of a B movie.I finished the book - skimming over large chunks of it,it was too predictable - the female lead - divorced mother - self sufficient - yet vulnerable -the male lead - fbi agent - tortured past - fear of intimacyI wish I had enjoyed it even a little - there was nothing redeeming about the book except for the ideaI'd love to see this redone - with someone else writing it - and new characters."
2,Waiting for the train to leave the station!,"I had high hopes for this novel. I rarely read fiction and thought (mistakenly) that this would finally be a book with which to shift gears. The subject has facinated me for decades and I find myself, like others, thirsting for another piece or two to fill in the puzzle, albeit fictional. Unfortunately, this novel never left the station for me. The story is like the mile-long coal trains I use to watch in the Southwestern United States. They are very, very slow to start and at the point when you believe they can attain a reasonable speed, they slow down at every curve or incline. I found myself growing increasingly impatient with the story line. And the pace? Commuter traffic in DC is faster. I'm going back to the realm of nonfiction and anthropology!"
3,Air Fare,"Picked this book up at the airport because I had forgotten one that I had wanted to bring. My usual fare is along the quality of Ludlum books and this one is not at that level, but for a good read on too long of a flight it works well. Much of the story is enjoyable but there are parts that really drag. Some parts are not readily believable, but for the most part the story line keeps your attention. Not as difficult to read as the Seven Pillars of Wisdom and not as fun as Harry Potter, but acceptable if you rather read a decent story surrounding an interesting concept then work crossword puzzles or read airline catalogs."
2,"Bad writing, silly plot, waste of time!","If you like REALLY formulaic books with poor over-used plot lines, telegraphed twists, and dialogue written by a high school student (with no prior writing experience), then you'll love this book. Otherwise don't bother. Really. Even for the usual airport pablem, this was laughably bad."
3,a thriller that is very similar to the Da Vinci Code but a good read on its own merits.,"This thriller is clearly in the same vein as the The Da Vinci Code. In fact, I doubt it would have been written without the success of the earlier novel. There is an ancient mystery. It involves, surprise, the Templars, a medieval religious order of warrior monks, which really did exist and are still shrouded in mystery. There are clues surrounding various ancient artifacts, that are solved by modern day professionals. The Catholic church wants to suppress the whole thing. Sound familiar? Actually, as a derivative work, the thriller isn't bad, its just not particularly original. As with many thrillers, the main characters are fairly plastic, but they are assigned some complexity and we are given some personal history for their motivations. The thriller does evolve into more of a romance story at the end, but the mystery is concluded with a definitive ending. All in all, a good read, if you are a Dan Brown fan."
1,Bad and boring,Ridiculous plot; formulaic romance; annoying people making incomprehensible decisions; a Vatican hit man; archeological vandalism; every noun with its cliched adjective...don't waste your time.
1,Possibly the Worst Book Ever...,"Okay, I've given some scathing reviews before, but this book is by far the worst. And all of this is aside from the horrible writing, the simplified plot, and the one dimensional characters. I'm going to have to look into what movies this guy writes, because if his novels are this bad, one can only imagine... If you're the type of person that has to finish a book, no matter how horrible it is, I strongly urge you not to buy this book. It's awful the entire way through, and the ending is the worst.*spoiler* What annoyed me the most was that a week or two on an idyllic Greek island convinces an archaeologist that a book written by Christ himself is better destroyed than revealed to the world - without even having a clue what Christ had written?!?! A writer, who had the courage to jump onto Dan Brown's gravy train, is willing to tell the world that ignorance is bliss?"
2,Sigh - the hours I'll never have back,"This is the authors first novel. It shows. The work wouldn't have gotten nearly as much attention without Dan Brown. The plot was ok - but predictable. The dialog was wooden. And the basic grammatical structure of whole elements was too rigid. Take a look at how characters are introduced - the same form each time.I didn't hate it. But I wouldn't recommend it, and I certainly wish I had read something different."
1,Terrible novel,"Glad to come here and see I'm not alone in thinking this was awful. It did indeed get off to a fair start but quickly peters out. Following some of the same territory as The Da Vinci Code it is unfortunate that it's nowhere near as satisfying. Poor writing, ridiculous love story you see coming a million miles away and the ending gives up so it's not satisfying to anyone. I kept with this thinking (hoping) it would have a payoff but it ended up being a total waste of time."
1,Blazing Start but Disappointing Finish,"This was a very unsatisfying novel that gets off to a memorable and exciting start but quickly turns into a mind-numbing read. The premise of the Last Templar has some promise and will grab the attention of fans of the Da Vinci code, but the execution of the story leaves much to be desired. The characters are flat and the reader never feels compelled to root for against any of the major characters. Some of the scenes are outrageously contrived, and by the time I got to the end I was rolling my eyes in disbelief. I suppose it's true that the first ten pages are what sell a book, but the last few hundred will keep me from coming back for more from this author.This is quite possibly the most forgettable book I've read in the last two years."
1,A Lost Treasure,"I've never read a more disapointing ending in my life! This book is not worth reading. There's a herione that charms everyone with her breathtaking beauty and carries herself like Aubrey Hepburn while not showing any of the wear and tear of being a divorced single-mother that hates her job! Then there's the loathsome FBI agent haunted by one of the dumbest lines of logic I've ever seen! Then there's the sadistic spook that kills everyone he comes in contact with, yet spares the life of his nemesis and lets him tag along to foible his plans! Imagine seeking a lost treasure chest only to find it and destroy it before you even see what's inside. That's what this book is about. Terrible."
1,Da Vinci Code wannabe,"A mediocre attempt to ride on the coattails of the successful blockbuster, The DaVinci Code. Like the DaVinci Code, it has an anti-Catholic, anti Christian theme with poor scholarship that is presented as fact. IT is a modern day 'thriller' with ties to the past and a fanciful history. Could have been fun if it was less melodramatic, with better writing and less of an agenda."
1,If there was only one book on the planet and this book was it I would still not read it!,I was only able to stomach 15 pages of this book. I congratulate any maschochist strong enough to finish it. Implausible and boring were the only two things I could think I as read the few pages. I almost sent the book back and demanded a refund but instead decided to put the book to good use and trashed it.Who gives these people book deals?
1,"All sizzle, no steak..","I overcame the incredibly poor writing, the completely ridiculous ""decisions"" made by the characters, the practically copied premise (from Da Vinci Code) all to find that the author rushed to tie it all up neatly at the end, without caring what he had led me to believe about the characters. It isn't so much the ending, as the fact that the author invests absolutely no time to make it a reasonable or believable result.Ridiculous. Thankfully, it's such a poorly written book and such a laughable premise that we'll be spared the movie version. I have never had such a visceral negative response to having read a book."
2,Close but no cigar,"Yes yes I can hear you saying William dosn't stand for poorly written fiction regarding The Templars, Christ and enough good old fashioned intrigue to full a pleasant afternoons Sunday reading, but you would be wrong ! All these raw elements together make the perfect ingredients for a wonderful tale. And dear reader that is what frustrates me most about ""The Last Templar"" despite all the right stuff the final result is a shocker. The start has merit but them falls quickly into predictable clap trap that when you finally turn the last page you are more relieved that satisified, sadly another poor copy of that nickle and dime work ""The Da Vinci Code"", well off to read another work, sadly coming to the belief that if you want good qualitity about the Templars you have to head to the Non Fiction section of the library. Would some one please prove me wrong."
1,Hard to finish,"Good beginning with the 4 horsemen storming the museum but this book goes quickly downhill. Lame prose, problems get solved so quickly and easily it's a wonder this ""mystery"" wasn't solved earlier, and the ""love"" story is ridiculous. Apparently Turkey will have no issues with an FBI agent running around it's borders and the CIA and Vatican are working together but no details about why or for what purpose. The ending tries to be everything to everyone but fails. Book jacket claims the idea for the book was started before the Da Vinci Code was published but it doesn't mean you still have to publish the book. Thank goodness I bought this for a $1 at a Library book sale!"
1,Dan Brown Should Sue,"It shouldn't be surprising that an author who stoops to phony reviews and negative vote campaigns would have trouble with a borrowed plot and characters, and Khoury lives right down to expectations. This is a very flat and unimaginative rip off of every other Templar story, with a not-very-hidden agenda."
1,Mediocre with dissatisfying ending,"Although this was a page turner, the book left me with a bad taste in my mouth. It assumes the audience immediately understands and accepts that the Christian church does more good than harm in the world. The ending was so poorly written that I regret reading this book."
1,Skip this one!,"Save your money. I guess the author wanted to capitalize on the DaVinci Code bandwagon. The plot is extremely lame. I found myself saying ""come on"" more than once. There are many other Templar novels much more interesting."
2,Letdown,"One big yawn. Character development would help, as well as some realistic emotions/reactions. I felt like I was reading a history book with some fictional characters thrown in to break it up. There is no comparison to the Da Vinci Code. If you have to read this book, don't waste money on it--find it at the library or you can have mine!"
1,Soon to be starring Bruce Willis as Hudson Hawk,What a waste of time. If you like Dan Brown reread one of his books.The book is formulaic and trite. Totally predictable.The author is supposed to be a screenwriter and it shows. This book reads like a bad movie treatment. Its going to take a huge special effects budget to make the movie worth watching on cable.
3,Read better,"This book had it's moments, yes. It did intrigue me and that's why it got a 3 star rating. I just expected more. Give me a book with lots of action and intriguing locales.If you like fantasy or adventures, try The Unsuspecting Mage by Brian S. Pratt. His first book is exciting fantasy with wars, magic, secret passages, etc. It's quite exciting and was hard to put down."
2,THE LAST TEMPLAR,"I really anticipated the release of this book and bought it as soon as it was available. I really enjoyed the book for the most part, but I really took exception to the references to the Bible and how it is untrue. That made me sick, because I am a belivever and I love Jesus and all the parts of the Bible. Why couldn't Mr. Khoury have some other treasure for the Templars to keep?I want Mr. Khoury to know that if he doesn't believe in Jesus there is a literal hell for him when he dies. And THAT is the truth!"
4,The End,"Great read, interesting and fast moving, until you get toward the end and you realize the author has to come up with convuleted ending."
2,Vaguely Familiar,"I was not a huge fan of ""The Da Vinci Code"" for the same reasons I am not a huge fan of this book: flowery prose, clichés, predictability, etc. However, just like ""Da Vinci"", it was still an exciting read, just not quite on the level I was expecting. The similarities between this book and Dan Brown is so unbelievably similar, though, that for the duration of the book I felt the been-there-done-that thing. It is still an exciting and interesting read, just not on the level of, say, a Sarah Dunnant (if you are looking for unforeseeable plot turns and excellent vocabulary, pick her up!)."
3,No more conspiracy please!,"This latest ""conspiracy"" thriller begins in a breathtaking fashion, with the historic fall of Acre in 1291. First few chapters in modern times also sign out with rapid swipes at present day crime-handling and existential troubles of the protagonists. Unfortunately, the thrill is lost as soon as the identity of the villain/victim-of-fate/crusader/templar is disclosed. Also, the so-called world shattering truth that everybody is looking for (to reveal or destroy) turns out to be rather tame compared to ""Da Vinci Code"". Most importantly, Tess sucks and Reilly wimps. The author's next work should have stronger hero-heroines, and better & neater endings."
3,Not that far from Dan Brown,"The Last Templar is good escapist reading, taking up some of the same themes found in Sam Harris' non-fiction book, The End of Faith.I enjoyed the story, and, unlike some reviewers, thought that the final chapter saved it. I did, however, find Tess extremely annoying, which kept me from giving the book more than three stars. She is supposed to be an archeologist and a bright woman. But her stupid, extremely unprofessional behavior is, ironically, what keeps the plot moving.Not nearly as good as Dan Brown's books? One reviewer recommended Angels and Demons. That is not a bad book, but it, too, has some really absurd plot lines.Perhaps The Last Templar will inspire readers to look up some serious histories on the crusades."
3,"An alternate ending suggestion, for an otherwise strong first novel","The discovery/journal/gospel is not a hoax. It is presented to the world for what it is. The abomination that is ""The Church"" that tries to suppress it's release is shown to the world. And its writer is exalted, through his writing, as a man/woman like you and I who; lives a perfect temporal life as an exemplar for us all, is murdered for his efforts, and is resurected after three days to prove that you and I can hope for the same should we live by his teachings!I Applaud Raymond Khoury's attempt. Although I would prefer something akin to my suggested ending, I find it hard to be overly critical of his efforts. Christ was, is, and always will be our redeemer. If his writings were ever found they would certainly only support our testimonies of this truth, for the betterment of all, from every faith. A good novel after all and entertaining."
2,Disappointing,"As others have said, this book started off so strongly that I thought I was in for another ""DaVinci Code"". Instead, it got itself caught up in a lot of the same old tired cliches you expect from a bad action movie. There's the obsessed scholar, the haunted male hero who doesn't open up to anyone, the villain seeking revenge and a conspiracy to protect old secrets. It didn't bother me until about halfway through, when the book just went on some unbelievable paths. The ending especially was disappointing, as it was your typical BS Hollywood ending with people coming back from the dead, sudden changes of heart and everyone living happily ever after. Note to the author: it's a very bad sign when I start rooting for the ""heroes"" to fail to escape from a perilous situation. It only avoids one star because the scenes that take place in the middle ages were well done, and there is a nice little twist right at the end that I enjoyed. Otherwise, a largely forgettable book."
2,Don't expect much...,"After enjoying The DaVinci Code and even more so Angels and Demons, I thought this would be a good filler until DB's next installment. Wow was I wrong. Although it started off strong it got way too bogged down in a lame love story, with the main characters committing absolutely outrageous actions that most intelligent, educated people would never even consider. I understand its fiction and I can accept some extra-ordinary events to keep the reader excited, but this was ridiculous."
3,"Easy, fast reading","I found this an enjoyable, fast reading book. It also include some historical references to the Knights of Templar (that may or may not be true), but that seems to interest me even more. I found it very easy to read 5-10 pages at a time during my commute. Very recommendable for beeach reading or commuting.The plot seems to follow the same formula as the Davinci Code: the church is center of a conspiracy, something sinister happens that may have religous undertones, a man and woman and work together traveling around the world in their search for answers, as the plot progresses it seems that the discovery would challenge religous doctrine, the final discover is simplistic, and the man and woman fall in love over their shared experiences. Not very sophisticated or surpising, but it worked for me."
3,"interesting read, but can be much better!","The book reads like a typical Hollywood movie.Sure enough, the author professed that this book is amovie script-turned-novel book. I would not besurprised it was made into a movie soon.My major complaint of this book is the charactersare not very believable. Their personalities changedback and forth so much during the book that it notnot convincing at all. I can overlook those inaccuraciesof facts that so many readers pointed out since this is,after all, a fiction. But the author should do a betterjob to make the personalities of characters consistentthroughout the book to make it more convincing.Nevertheless, it is a page-turner and I did find thediscussion of religions in the book interesting."
1,The ending...straight out of James Bond...was so painful to read,"I've got a soft spot for anything Templar, fiction or non-fiction. This was an ""OK"" light read....until the ending...which is straight out of a James Bond movie. Doesn't the author have any friends, or a kind editor to save him from himself?Don't bother with this one."
1,Positively Awful,"I gave this book one star only because I did not have a zero-star option. Based on the now familiar secret-religious-history-conspiracy theme, the book opens with promising scenes of a daring museum robbery, but quickly degenerates into a series of absurdities that are easily punched full of holes. The characters are a group of cliches, not at all interesting, and the budding romance between the two major characters reads like a Harlequin romance on quaaludes. The writing style is unimaginative and uninspired. Mr. Khoury writes as though this were merely an outline of a story, to be fleshed out later. Unfortunately, he never fleshes it out. In half-page sketches, Mr. Khoury runs through scenes that should have taken whole chapters. I finally gave up and tossed it in the trash less than half finished. Some books just aren't worth the time. I strongly recommend that you give this one a wide berth."
3,"Quick read, cop-out ending.","The book is about a search for an object. You want to know more about this object.After 523 pages, you never find out what you want to find out. You ""sort of"" find out, but you don't.Confused?It feels like the author couldn't come up with something really revolutionary so he treats the object in question as a MacGuffin, where the object itself isn't important, just the quest for it.Don't get me wrong, the pages turn quickly, it's just that for a book that spends so much time on enlightenment, it quickly did an about face at the end and didn't enlighten me as to what the big fuss was about.I was left hanging"
3,Almost There,"I am about three-quarters of the way through the book. On the positive side, the book maintains a very strong and engaging pace. I fear that on the negative side, the writing is very cliche driven. Additionally, there are sections where the author is providing interesting history lessons, the problem is that the narrative sounds like a classroom lesson. Nobody speaks that way in ""normal"" day to day conversations with others. In any event, I would still say that the book is worth reading. It is certainly a cut above the other seeming DVC inspired books."
1,The worst Templar book ever,"If Da Vinci Code should get 3 stars, The Last Templar should get 1.This book had an exciting opening, but it went downhill very quickly. The characters were very shallow and unbelievable. I kept thinking ""she wouldn't do that,"" or ""that wouldn't happen.""Don't start this one. You will be disappointed."
5,Da Vinci Code eat your heart out,"If you want a book that brings doubt to you beliefs, this is a must read. Dan Brown's Da Vinvi Code doesn't come near. This is the book the Cathlic Church should have gotten upset with. Fast pace with the reluctant to put down. Story swings from now to the past during the last days of the Templars. Lot of cloak and dagger setting along with mystery and archaeoloy. Raymond Khoury really brings his readers into his worlds and causes you to think about your own world. I promise you'll be taking a big breath at the end of this book."
1,Simply an awful cheat...,"It's about Templar's ""big"" secret, villainous historian, gorgeous archeologist on a globe trotting adventure, and handsome FBI agent filling the shoes of super heroe. I am not even going to divulge more into the plot, because this book is simply 500 plus pages rip-off from `DaVinci Code'. Please spare yourself if you love Brown's book. I started to read this book when I was vacationing and after a couple of hours of reading I rushed immediately to the end of the book expecting exactly what will happen.To author and publishers: please stop imitating others people work. I know it's easy to make a dollar on somebody's famous work, especially if somebody is already established screenwriter like Mr. Khoury who probably doesn't need much effort to convince publishers to publish his work. Try to be inventive and come with something more original."
2,A Sham,"I liked this book for the first three-quarters, but watch out, the last step is a lulu. ""The Last Templar"" starts out promisingly enough, with lots of action and an interesting historical backstory. The prose, while wooden, is not as pulpy as ""The DaVinci Code,"" and the characters are a bit more full-fleshed and sympathetic. Unfortunately, the story becomes more ""Perils of Pauline"" than engrossing historical thriller, and I realized that Mr. Khoury had bitten off more than he could chew. There was no way that he could end the book in a satisfying manner, and he didn't, but the finale was so crass and repugnant that I wanted to slap the man. I consider this book the Anti-DaVinci Code, because though the DVC had many flaws, it opened people's minds to new ideas, and made them reconsider old beliefs. ""The Last Templar"" dabbles in this, but its conclusion betrays the very readers that the title and opening premise lured in. To pardon the pun, the ending is a real ""cop-out."""
1,Another Da Vinci wanabe,"When you read fiction you have to suspend your logic thinking a little. ""Writers license"". But to keep reading this book you have to throw it over board y go inland as fast and as far as you can. From the initial scene, that some of the comennts here find ""riveting"" is...unbelievable. That 4 horsemen dressed as medieval warriors, yelm, sword and metal coat and all assault de Met , kill and rob and then escape , still riding on horses, thru de Central Park! and...dissapear!..unbelievable. Buy another book. This is a waste of paper"
1,Audio edition: thumbs down,"The narrator does just fine with the New Yawk types. His voice for the female lead seemed at tad annoying, but I figured that was in part the writing.Then we get to the French dealer in precious artifacts, and it becomes clear--this fellow just can't do accents. He even mispronounces words in ways that are absolutely clueless, e.g. pronouncing Louvre using two syllables. Other foreign words are similarly mispronounced, or the narrator strives just too hard to try to get the accent. A half-decent producer would have been a big, big help.The audiofile review says that ""He's a master of emotion and accent, whether he's channeling an Italian cardinal or a Turkish thug."" Maybe there's another secret edition of this that I missed?"
2,Fast-paced Drivel,Just an overall weak book. I kept thinking it would get better and it just got weaker. Don't waste your time.
2,Disappointing to say the least,"Shallow, predictable, and lacking in literary skill. The only reason I gave it two stars is because I made it to the end of the book. If you like Dan Brown, you might feel disappointed with this one."
3,"Good action, but too preachy near the end","Like the reviewer before me said, this is a book that starts out like it's going to be a top-drawer thriller. The 2 lead characters, while typically beautiful and superintelligent, still manage to be interesting, and the pace is kept up well.Where the book runs into trouble is when the author, speaking through his characters, begins to philosophize on the subject of religion. I'm not detracting from his views, but this isn't exactly what I look for in a thriller. I want action, some twists, some interesting characters, and an intelligent and logical plot. What I don't want it is a treatise, which is what this book becomes in its second half.Even with these faults, it's certainly not a bad read. I was a little let down because of the expectations I had, but it's still better than much of what's out there in the thriller field."
3,Was almost a solid four,"I have to say, this book started out really, really good. I was hooked until about two thirds of the way through and then it just lost something. I read a lot of thrillers and I was thinking maybe this is going to go to the top of the list, but it just didn't make it. I won't bore you with a book summary, Amazon does that nicely....and I would probably pick up another book from this author, but I may wait for paper...Like I said, a strong start, fizzle at the end."
2,Disappointing,"Apparently, like many other readers, I went into this book with high hopes. Nothing like suppressed religious history to get the juices flowing. While it did start out well, the LAST TEMPLAR rather quickly degenerated into a stereotypical thriller with all the baggage that comes with that label. I ended up skipping long passages in the latter stages of the book just to avoid reading the tedious prose that was used to describe mundane matters. The ""villain"" was the same as in every other book of this type, the heroine as well. Even the revelation of what it is they are hunting came as no surprise. Or rather, it was an interesting concept doomed by poor writing. At the end I simply did not care what it was everyone was searching for or how the world might change if they found it. The most interesting parts of the book were the four short sections set in the time of the Templars. Maybe if the book had stayed in the past it would have been better."
2,The Last Templar,"The Last Templar. If asked, as I was 99-44/100 through the book, whether I ""loved"" it, I would have said: ""Yes indeed"". However, the ending was so bad and pointless, that it made the entire book reading experience a bit of downer. Why even start a book with that kind of downer ending is the question."
3,Almost there...,"The book had good potential. Interesting plot, but it failed by the middle. The characters were a bit too cliche and the story started to drag on for quite a bit in the middle and by the end, I was just waiting to finish it off. I predicted the ending when I read through 3/4 of the book."
2,Lack of the Templar Mystique,"If you want to read similiar plot and premises copy-cat style from the Da Vinci Code, than this is the ONE! It way too uninspiring for historical semblances about the mystical enigma called the Templars.Plus the chopped up style of editing this novel causes me to fall asleep.Try reading the real thing concerning this fascinating era..such as Holy Blood Holy Grail instead. Sometimes truth is way more intriquing than this Last book about the Templars."
3,The action sucks you in right from the beginning,"The mystery is very intriguing, and the history of the Templars made it worth reading. But the similarity to DaVinci Code cheapens the whole story.Major conspiracy from 2000 years ago that will rock the foundations of Christianity...puhleez.It was good airport reading."
3,3 stars,"The beginning was good. The middle was slow. The ending somewhat better than the middle.I liked the way the author went back and forth in time.The ending was somewhat unexpected and ok!However, it is not in the league with the Da Vinci Code and comparing the two is overhyping this book and under appreciating the Da Vinci Code."
3,Talk about mixed feelings,"I picked up 'The Last Templar' because of all the fuss about it being a knock off of 'Da Vinci Code' which it is of course but all the discussion got me interested. As for the novel, the story drags, and the methodical plotting aside, it does build to a satisfactory conclusion. You just have to hang in there until the end."
3,Almost there,"I heard nothing about the book and picked it up mostly because it was sitting next to ""Da Vinci Code"". I liked the structure and the quick-read of the story. It, like 'Da Vinci Code' lost it somewhere towards the end and it felt as though the writer had to 'wrap it up'.I wish it had stayed in the one of the timelines. Instead in jumped around as if we were loosing interest or needed it 'spelled out for us'. All-in-all it is a decent read and a decent story."
2,"They came, they attacked, it was over...","So many chapters, so little to say... The book offers a promising start but does not deliver. I felt like I was reading a bit of Dennis Lehane, mixed with dim humorous attempts à la Harlan Coben and above all a pale imitation of Brown's DaVinci. I might admire the courage of the author for publishing such a story after the triumph of the others but he simply doesn't rate. It could have been a great story, after all the Templars are a fasciniting group, but as far as I am concerned...Hollywood might like it."
3,The Last Templar- A Story of the Knights and their Legacy,"The Last Templar - is the first attempt by the author Khoury into the world of historical novels. It starts with a bang as four knights on horses come up the steps of a NY Museum and a create horrific scenario among the many celebrating a new museum show opening.This is a story that winds and turns with interspersed historical chapters through out. It is documented well in the beginning, but somehow loses the historical and story momentum about half way through.The story line is not clearly defined and the character development seems less than what is required to keep a reader riveted. The portion that might have helped this book along is the factual data that would strenghten the story and create more intrigue for the reader.The story becomes less plausible as the primary characters seek to find the pivotal item lost and sought after. This is very much like DaVinci without the suspense and thrillride of Dan Brown."
2,Not worth your time.,"The Last Templar would have been an ""okay"" paperback. It certainly doesn't belong on the NYT Best Seller List. A MUCH better book is the new title by Steve Berry--The Templar Legacy. It is better written, has better pacing and characters, and a much more satisfying ending."
1,Anti-Christian Bash,"Mr. Khoury obviously has a real problem with christianity. The book is loaded with the usual junk about how scholarship leans heavily in favor of Christ the myth. Too bad he ignores 2,000 yrs of great scholarship. Whether you believe or don't this book is such an obvious slam that it needs to be ignored."
2,Not what I expected..watch out devout Christians.,"I was intrigued by the story line... only to get more disappointed as the story went on. As a Christian, I almost felt insulted at how they throw down the church and Jesus. That is is all a farse... I couldn't stomach reading the rationale behind it... trying to justify why the church is lying to everyone... with just a touch of faith... it wasn't enough for me to feel good about the story... even at the end... I walked away with feeling sad that there may be young ones or anyone having doubts about Christianity and this can push them to believe all is lost. Not happy ..."
2,The Last Templar,Not so good. The story started out exciting and adventurous but somewhere in the middle it turned into a love story. It totally lost focus. I was very dissapointed.
1,Disappointing,"Having just finished the Di Vinci Code, I thought I would try another in the same vein. But unfortunately, this book does not even come close. Raymond Khoury appears to be trying to ride on Dan Brown coat tails, but he is not even in the same league. From the very beginning, this is more Hollywood than literature - a very Freshman attempt at best."
1,A book to be enjoyed by coma patients,"I can't decide what is worse, screen-to-print novels written based on bad movies, or screen-to-print novels written based on bad movies that have never been made. Cookie-cutter plots, predictable ""insert a commercial here"" chapter endings, one dimensional characters, cliche after cliche after cliche.Now, a book doesn't have to be Hemingway or Shakespeare to be enjoyed (hell, I read Clive Cussler), it just has to not be physically painful to read. Yes, I should have quit halfway through it and used its pages as blot for my garage floor, but I figured I already spent the money. Sort of like paying for a really bad movie in the theatre...you really want to leave, but you fought for parking and paid for popcorn with your left kidney. It's almost an obligation.Khoury wins in one category: Finally beating out Dan Brown as the most over-blown and poorly written blockbuster of the year.I would have given this book 0 stars, but it wasn't an option."
1,You can't judge this book by its cover,"The cover of this book caught my eye in the bookstore. However its $9.99 asking price for a paperback was too steep so we got it from the library. I am sure glad we didn't buy it! The initial chapters are fast pace and full of good action. I lost interest after 300 pages. This book is plotted out like a cable-tv mini series on the Sci-fi channel - its best work is in the initial stages. The fact the ""heroine"" is able to figure out who stole the decoding device from the museum after one paragraph of dialogue ruined the whole story for me. In the end, I really didn't care enough to finish it. My wife finished it and filled me in on the ending."
2,One of the weakest novel endings ever!,"I only wish to comment on the ending. Without giving anything away (for those who wish to read or in process), Khoury never divulges what any great author would.In other words, the reader is left pointlessly hanging and wondering what the all the fuss was about. Also, the characters actions at the end make little to no sense."
2,"beautiful lamp, touch on/off goes haywire","I bought one of these lamps knowing they are oversized. It fits nicely in my living room.....but the touch-on/off switch goes haywire. Whenever I walk past it it changes from dim to bright to off to dim again. it also randomly turns on and off when I am in another room.The exterior looks nice, so two stars. Maybe mine was just defective.....I think I am going to try to strip its guts out and rewire a regular switch...."
5,Simple..This man is a great artist.,"No matter what music you listen to, you should pick up ANY of this man's CD's. What a great tallent. This is not my favorite disc by John...but it is still a great disk. Check out the full of spirit 'good noise'...one of the best cuts in recorded history!"
3,A Disappointment from Gorka is better than the best of many.,"Gorka remains one of the finest lyric writers in the game, equalled only by Lyle Lovett. This CD was a little disappointing, however, in that the songs begin to all sound alike after a while. I much preferred Jack's Crows over Out of the Valley."
4,The best artist I never heard of,"On first listen, I thought this CD might be a bit too ""country"" for my taste. I now accept it as folk. Gorka has a way with words that makes me wish I could write. Because if I could, this is what it would probably be like."
3,Almost as funny as I remembered,"Read the title. If it makes you laugh, you'll probably enjoy the movie. Cheesy in the extreme, plays fast and loose with stereotypes, but it still makes me laugh if I'm in the mood for something this wonderfully bad. John Carradine is, and always will be, the king of the ""B"" movie."
5,Live Modern Folk Music at its Best,"Fans of Wes can't live without this live record. It is a must-have for all. Early versions of ""The Devil in Me"" and ""Who You Really Are"" as well as brilliant spur-of-the-moments songs like ""July the 13th, 1985"" and the 'acapulco number' ""The Night He Took Her to the Fairground"" are only to be found on this album. I enjoy it from beginning to end every time I listen to it."
3,Tough spaghetti western with a comichal touch!,"In every way a very entertaining,cool and funny western.Enzo G Castellariis one of the best italian action movie makers,and this film is beutifullyphotographed and actionpacked, with a great,classic score by Francesco De Masi.George Hilton is typecast as a gunslinger dressed in black,and always very good in westerns.Its probably the best Italian production Edd Byrnesever appeard in.I recommend it!"
5,Master of Illusion,"If you are unfamiliar with Thomas Demand's work it's almost a shame to say something before you look at his work. He works with paper (and I think other materials sometimes) to create scenes that look real. For example, one of his pieces is a simple view of a house looking through tree leaves, but you realize the entire scene is created from cut out paper. Quite amazing.This hardback book accompanies the exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in 2005. There is no dust cover and the work is gorgeously reproduced on nice paper stock.The book is divided into the following chapters:Foreword - Glenn D. LowryAcknowledgementsPaper Moon - Roxana MarcociPhotographic Memory - Jeffrey EugenidesThe PhotographsThe FilmsExhibitions and Selected BibliographyI am interested in dioramas, toy theatres, miniature set design (e.g. Gerry Anderson productions) etc. and I can imagine this title and Demand's work would be of interest to many creative types for a variety of reasons.Highly recommended."
3,Other reviews are reviewing incorrect tape,"Several reviews written for ""The Bolshoi Ballet"" are incorrectly reviewing a performance of Giselle starring Ulanova. This is not the content of this tape. This tape is a survey of several ballet excerpts, shown both in rehersal and on stage. The lighting is poor, as is the camera work."
1,1 ex-Fudge + 1 Nugent cast-off does not a Vanilla Fudge make,"Although this 1991 performance is credited to ""Vanilla Fudge"" the only original member on this recording is drummer Carmine Appice. The other musician that I can identify by ear, having known him since he was 14, is Derek St. Holmes. St. Holmes is the lead vocalist on this live recording and is likely handling most of the guitar work as well, having been Ted Nugent's lead singer/second guitarist during his rise to fame in the mid 70s. There's no arguing Appice's and St. Holmes' talent. And it isn't the first time they've collaborated. But neither of them sound like they care about the material. Let's face it. This is an unadulterated grab for your cash and the lack of musician credits proves it. Shame on you, Derek, for participating in such a blatant rip-off. Besides, when we we're in competing bands in high school you always hated our version of ""You Keep Me Hangin' On."""
5,The Best Husky Book,"I purchased a siberian husky 1 year ago and wanted to learn as much as I could about the breed. This book says it all. I have bought several other books, and basically they stink. This book is well written, has beautiful pictures and truely says how a husky is. If you are thinking of purchasing a husky or already own one, and want some help in understanding your dog - this book is for you. Cannot say enough about this book. If I could give it more than five stars I would."
2,Incomplete treatment of issues,"I have reviewed critical articles and graphics from this book to determine whether it should be considered as a possible home school reference. Under the guise of neutrality, the editors and writers present only the humanist driven explanations of the creation of life and the science of genetics. Intelligent design perspectives and scriptural facts are missing from their scientific literalist presentations of cell biology. Most importantly, contemprary religious issues are not considered or clearly portrayed in treatments of ethical issues.I would not recommend this book as appropriate as a stand-alone reference resource for home school study. W. Stephens (PATH reviews for home study resources.)"
5,A classic.,"This book and its companions (Angus Lost, Angus and the Ducks) were childhood favorites of mine and my brothers, and are now favorites for my 5-year-old son. The text uses some sequences and varies those sequences, making it great fun for smaller children to fill in, yet the pacing of the story and the language allow an adult to tolerate reading the book over and over (and over and over). The details that evoke the dog's point of view (for example, Angus' own special square of sunshine) bring the story to life and the theme - a dog's eventual reconciliation with a feline invader into his household - is timeless. If you read to young children, this book belongs in your bookshelf."
5,Angus sees eye to eye with kids,These books are wonderful! I feel that a good children's book should teach children without patronizing them and without annoying adults. Angus exceeds these expectations. Reading about him is a joy. Angus has a kid's eye view of the world. Each new adventure move him to a greater understanding of how things work. In this book the presence of a new and mysterious cat in his house causes Angus some anxiety at first. In the end it teaches him about sharing. For a little Scottie he stands tall in the world of children's literature.
5,Fantastic Fish!,Excellent concert! Fish is funny as hell on the documentary travel disk where he takes you behind the scenes of preparing for his concerts. The disk also includes a very interesting interview with Fish. Having been a big Fish fan since the mid 80s (with Marillion) I have always hoped that one day there would be a decent DVD of some of his concerts because he rarely gets to play in the U.S. Here it is! Don't miss this powerful concert! You will most likely never get to see too many concerts as good as this in the U.S. So check it out!
3,good but could have been much better,"What is expected from Fish? A good show yes but what else? If you have seen Fish play Live ,their is a good chance that you will be dissapointed in this show. Fish always communicates with his crowd and tells stories and jokes .This is what makes Fish Fish .Unfortunatelly ,their is none of this in this DVD and therefore it is very dissapointing to us.The charisma that Fish has was cut off from this film and is unfortunate.All you get are songs which is not enough .If you listen to tales from the big bus CD you will understand what i am talking about"
5,delightful,"What a wonderful movie. Kept my interest all the way through with no violence, sex, or foul language. We need more of these!"
1,not worth it,"I returned mine. I didn't think the instructions were very good, poor quality pictures with only basic bows - one style; not boutique bows, which I was looking for. And the device itself was poorly made. It was more effort to get the bows into it than I think was necessary. When I tied them off they were uneven, everyttime. I went through an entire spool of wire trying to practice and do better but it just wasn't working out. Making bows by hand or using a salon clip to hold the ribbon in place works a lot better for me."
2,Works but Cheaply Made,"I opened the box, removed the bowdabra and discovered one of the rubber feet left behind in the box. It was obviously broken off, but not critical to my use of the product. This does NOT come with any ribbon--I have mixed feelings about that. It would be nice to have something to follow the DVD with, but it's just as easy to purchase some ribbon as well, unless you are a total beginner and have no idea how much to purchase. I made my first bow, and the device worked (I obviously will need some practice), but I feel like it wouldn't take much to break it."
1,unhappy,"I bought two of these thinking I would be able to make the worlds greatest bows for an upcoming wedding and have a bow making party. I was wrong, this is awkward to use because it it lightweight and moves on the table. The bows came out awful and I ended up making them by hand using a method my mother taught me for package bows. I have lots of experience with craft projects and have wowed a lot of people so I should have been able to make some simple bows with this. Years ago, I owned a much better style bowmaker and loved it. I should have bought one like that again."
3,You get what you pay for....,"I have made bows for crafts and wreaths for many years without issue. I thought this product would assist with arthritic hands and speed for bow-making which is clearly NOT the case. I'm concerned every time I make a bow that I will break the plastic on the product. I rarely leave comments, but this purchase requires a strong review! If you are making small bows with light-weight material, this may work for you. I am returning for refund."
5,Great Advice!,"I travel abroad on business frequently, finally there is a book that gives me real advice on how to protect myself. Thanks Mr. Aviv. I recommend it to everyone. I only wish employers would give it out to their employees."
2,Not quite,The book is not quite what I expected. It could have been much more detailed in regard to how individuals should prepare themselves for specific things that are expected to happen in the future. The author's broad knowledge of international security makes the book worthwhile from the overall perspective.
5,Buchanan has this one right,"I usually sympathize with the liberals on most issues, and disagree with Buchanan on most issues, but Buchanan is right on the mark with respect to the Neoconservatives. These ideologues hold to rigid ideological dogmas that are totally at variance with the realities of the middle east and the Muslim world. Due to the fact that they have been able to con the naive, poorly informed, and not particularly intelligent President Bush into implementing their policies in the middle east, the result has been disastrous for the United States in the middle east. They must be removed from power before they do more harm to the U.S.. Clearly they will not be removed from power as long as Bush remains President. Ending their dangerous influence on U.S. policy is going to require a regime change in Washington."
2,Buchanan is not right or left.,"But he is wrong.. his views on conservatism and liberalism are just that.. HIS VIEWS. this man is not a conservative, he is a social conservative, an isolationist and believes that defense is a non issue. i agree with about 80% of what he says on domestic issue's, but he allows his religion to cloud his morality. He still lives in the world that the jews killed jesus so support for Israel is bad. he believes in dialouge with muslims who would kill us, and he believes that any conservative who disagrees with him is a 'neoconservative'. BTW Pat the original neocon was Reagan. liberalism is the cancer that ""neocons"" and traditional conservatives can agree on, but Pat is living in a old mindset. the kind that got us into trouble before WWII, with an isolationist belief. if you want pat at his finest read 'death of the west'"
4,A Damning Review from a Conservative,"I bought and read this book to discover that not only ""liberals"" but also a known conservative, has real doubts and concerns about the Bush administration and the direction in which is taking our country. It is hard to believe that the media has failed to inform its viewers about the true story of the Bush administration and the neo-conservatives that are running it."
4,More than the title implies,"Though the title suggests the book is about the Bush era, it also covers US history back to end of the 19th century. In many respects it is a Manifesto of the author. The arguments are well backed by facts, and a very interessting read even if you don't agree."
3,Down by one star,"Critics in the biz may have judged this effort by one of Califirnia's best punk bands as a mature step forward. I agree, Down By Law are trying differnt things and writing better songs while slowly decrusting their hardened sound. A mature thing to do I suppose. The results of this growth do not however make for better listening. A few tracks work while but too many do nothing for me."
3,The Curse of King Tut,"I foung the book to be totally facinating, though I also found it lacking some of the historical facts."
3,Love the songs - hate the commercials,"We loved ""Tin Pan Alley Songs for Kids"" so we bought this CD. At the end of the CD is a COMMERCIAL - ugh! First videos, now cd's!?! If you don't mind the advertizing, the songs are fun for young and old alike."
2,This could have been far better done...,"Perhaps the next edition will be better. There is some information on the Croatan in here, yes, but this is supposed to be a tribebook about the Wendigo! The detail and scope of this book is so limited compared to some of the other tribebooks. It reads like it was rushed to print, in order to get it out of print so they could sell the next Litany compilation. I wish I'd never bought this one."
5,Very good Tribebook.,"Excellent book!!! The information on the Croatan is reason enough to get it. The presentation format is wonderfull. All hail the Wendigo, bitter warriors of the North. The Croatan information is also an excellent reason for storytellers' to get it."
1,This series sucks. The theme song alone makes me sick and I am a former Marine,"Well, you do get some actual real combat material footage. But, there is NO attention paid to chronology. They go from Korea to 1942 WWII stuff and it loses all context. Also, that THEME SONG becomes intolerable. You hear it all the time and it is pathetic. I am a 2 tour Marine vet of the Vietnam War. I love good war stuff. This is not it. ...Oscar"
4,You need to sleep,"What can I say....they are pajama's. Here in southern california it is often too warm for full on pajama's, but too cold for going kamando (not to mention socially frowned on).Often I just wear a tee and shorts to bed, but decided to get something suited to the task. The short sleeve top and short bottoms work, and match. The Large I ordered came marked as an XL (twice) so I guess that is how amazon sees it. Indeed, the XL fit like a slightly oversized Large, maybe too baggy in the drawers."
5,Hard to find short pjs,"Very hard to find product in the middle of winter, Thank you for having this product available online."
3,should come with a tube of superglue,"This product should be shipped with a tube of superglue. More than a few of the diamondesques fell out of the frame in shipping. I was able to find the missing pieces in the packing and glue them back in place. Be careful opening and look for missing bling. Other than that, it looks great going down the road. Lots of sparkle."
4,Rhinestones!!!!,"I wanted a frame that would stand out and glitter as I drove. This one is a really cute frame, but the Rhinestones are not as shiny or glimmery as I wanted. But I am still driving around with it =)"
3,Dog chain was strong but left stains on dogs's coat.,Everything was great with this chain but we had a switch because my dog is white and it was leaving a black dirty looking mark around his collar area. If your dog is a darker color there should be no issue
2,Quality of this set,"We are quite happy with the appearance of this jam set and it's so convenient. However, the quality is not so great. The inside of the lids are not dishwasher safe and are also adversely affected by the jams in the jars as are the spoons, which become discolored and corroded."
1,Spoons were missing. No response from JAF.,"I realize it's a $9 item so I am hesitant to complain, but I bought two of these-- one for me, one for my grandmother. It's not fancy and mine is seldom used but works out nicely for brunches (Method spray cleaner works better than silver cleaner on this finish!), but my grandmother's was missing its spoons. We attempted to contact the vendor several times and got no response. I ended up giving her my spoons."
1,No Filters,Do not buy this unit. I just ordered 1 micron filters from Grizzly for mine on 3/5/09. I got an email saying they where on back order and are expected on 8/22/09. That's a 5 1/2 month wait!
4,Covers the Kimberley,"It is one of the few guides which actually covers the North Coast and the Kimberley of Australia, the extreme northwestern area of the continent. The coverage is limited to about 20 pages of approximately 400, but at least it recognizes the area."
3,PURCHASE WARNING,"I know that this product seems great. It has almost everything built into it, especially a VERY FRAGILE SCREEN. I bought this DVD player and a 2 year Service Plan. My screen broke within a month (especially when I was extremely careful), as does some of Audiovox's other products (don't believe me, surf the web). Audiovox said that they didn't cover broken screens, even though it's the most delicate part of the system. They were going to charge me $200 to repair it and then give me another 90 day warranty. If it broke again, they were going to charge me AGAIN. I admit, I LOVE the DVD player. But if you value your money, make sure you know what the warranty covers. Audiovox has some issues and the customer service isn't that helpful. Buyers, you have been warned. I surely don't intend on spending $600 or more for this product which should be covered."
3,LOVE Everything But...,"I purchased this to replace a buggy 7"" CyberHome unit that didn't work very well. I really love everything about this model. The slim design and large screen are great. The external snap on/off battery is genius - The features and controls are wonderful and it is so easy to use....BUT, like another reviewer mentioned, the picture is WAY too fuzzy and soft for my taste :(It probably isn't fair to compare the picture to my CyberHome 7"" unit because I understand you loose some sharpness and clarity when you go up in size but it's hard not to compare and be disapointed in the picture quality of this otherwise excellent machine."
4,Audiovox D2010 10.2,Ive have the player for 3 month and have had no problems.The good: ease of use -- my 10 year old worked with no problems-- excellent picture quality --- not bad price on Amazon--good accessory packageThe bad : poor sound (without headphones)Over All satisfied w/purchase
5,My 15 year old love's it!!!,"This was bought for my 15 year old daughter to watch movie's on when she didn't want to watch what we were watching, needless to say she love's it, and never watches T.V. with us. She was also impressed with all the features, you can do stuff with your digital picture's, and all manner of thing's I can't understand, you've got to be a kid to run all the extra's!~!!"
5,Amazing.,"I just got this for Christmas and I have to say that this portable dvd player beats many of the more expensive dvd players out there. My friend has a Philips portable dvd player that has a smaller screen, not as good picture quality, and you can barely hear the sound and he got it at about the same price as I got this one. This one has a huge screen, really loud sound, and phenomenal picture quality. Not to mention, the player is very thin and modern looking. I'm very pleased with this dvd player!!!Oh, I have a question though.When I first opened the box, I plugged it in right away and I heard this funky sound every time it turned on. So I opened the place where you put in the dvd and I forgot to take out the tag that says ""remove before operating"". Do you think that affected my dvd player at all because when I'm watching the movie I can sometime hear the dvd spinning...is that normal or did that ""remove before operating"" tag mess it up?Thanks."
4,Great Product,"I bought this for my boyfriend because he travels a lot and so far it's been great. The sound isn't that great without headphones, but he only uses it with headphones so it's not really an issue.. The screen is huge! Just about as big as my laptop screen. Battery life is decent. If it's fully charged lasts about 3 hours."
3,9.25.07,"I purchased this dvd player, I had to send it back to the company that sent it to me, for the lens on the dvd player was defective, on the first time of using it. It randomly chose what dvds it wanted to play. But after i sent it back, i received another one, with no problems. It works fine.Only thing is that you have to be delicate with it, especially with the cover to where the dvd is placed, and the lens that reads the dvd. Anything little thing, could cause a scratch and prevent it from working."
1,MINE BROKE IN 1ST WEEK,I NEVER REVIEWED THIS ITEM BUT HERE IT GOES.. THIS WAS A TOTAL WASTE OF MY MONEY.. THE UNIT BROKE IIN LESS THAN A WEEK.. ** DO NOT BUY***
1,Audiovox D2010 10.2-Inch Widescreen Ultraslim Portable DVD Player,"No huge review necessary don't buy this product had it less than a year and it's junk. Lesson to be learned DON'T BUY CHEAP ELECTRONICS! Go with Phillips, Sony, Sanyo, Toshiba, Polaroid, etc. My Polaroid portable DVD player lasted 6 years before it finally played it's last disc and I used it every day for my kids, while I exercised, at work, vacation etc."
5,This is a hit!,"Saw the video on MYV and although the video is not particularly interesting, the song and lyrics will grab you. He sings with passion. The song has a great hook. This song should launch a career. If you like Train, Travis or Matchbox Twenty, you'll dig this cut, Achilles Heel. Buy it. Period."
5,Harris gets hard for us...,"Barry Harris gets right to it with slammin hardhouse diva anthems from Ralphi Rosario, the fierce Pusaka, and Donica. We get the overplayed ""Do It Again,"" thankfully for just a brief time, and then get moving into Escape's bangin' diva track Music Takes Me Higher. Another mix of ""Bang the Drum"" was on Circuit Sessions 6, so I could have done without it here. The second half of the disc gets mostly instrumental, but Harris knows how to select instrumental floor stompers that keep the party pumpin. One of the best volumes in the series. Track times:1. climb to the top (6:54)2. You're the worst thing (12:02)3. Ain't what I expected (5:10)4. Do it again (2:39)5. Music takes me higher (6:15)6. Your body so beautiful (3:37)7. the phantom (5:47)8. bang the drum (6:20)9. Horny drum machine (4:48)10. big muscles (5:17)11. fu*k me harder (8:08)"
5,Perfect condition!,"Thanks so much for sending a perfect product. This was a birthday gift for my boyfriend who watched the entire movie yesterday, with no skipping. Even new DVDs we buy occasionally skip, that's just how perfect this was :). Haha..thanks again!!!"
3,a good king film,"The Stand was good, not excellent. parts 1 and 4 are the best, fast paced and well acted. but 2 and 3 dragged and another miss about this film was Molly Ringwalds portrayl of fran. she seemed bored and disdained with her part. other than that a truly horrifying reality this film presents and a rare Stephen King movie thats watchable."
4,Perfect,"Perfect movie, certainly a must in case you like SK. Only reason to give four stars was the lack of English subtitles."
3,TV series without the commercials,"The Stand is not a movie experience; it is rather a television experience without the commercials. Special effects are wanting, and the acting can at times be sub-par. The first half is by far superior to the latter half, in that it actually provides mystery and tension. Overall the movie wasn't a complete waste of time, but I could think of better ways to spend six hours. I haven't read the book, but I would be willing to bet it far exceeds the caliber of this movie."
2,Reader's Digest movie-version.,How to take a AAA+++ masterpiece of writing and turn it into a B- movie.Some of the casting is spot-on but you just can't make this epic-novel into a 6-hour successful movie.It just didn't work.M-O-O-N...that spells failure.
4,What happened?!?,"I originally recorded it when it aired, but gave that tape to a friend when the manufactured one came out. When I got around to watching it, there was a bunch missing, and when you change tapes/ disks, all of a sudden there people missing, Gary Sinese is dying, and a huge story gap. What the hell happened? My original tapes got recorded over (I guess the Victories Secret special was more important than Steven King or something). Why did they drop around two hours of film? I mean, we all like them 20 hour Stephen King movies, so what's the deal?"
2,Never read the Book.,I know that if I had read the book this movie would have been better to me. I have always been a big fan of Stepehen Kings movies but I thought the acting and characters were awefull in this film. From what Ive heard when talking to people that have read the book they say that the onscreen performances in this movie are nearly perfect. So while I didnt like the devil character he may very well have been doing a superb job. So if you read the book you should definately purchase this DVD becuase you will most likely love the adaptation. If you havent read the book this movie may come off very cheesy.
5,The Stand,This movie it the most awsome of all time. I highly recommend this to everyone!!!! All the charcaters are great and the story line is indeed one of my favorites.
4,Excellent epic from master storyteller King...,"""The Stand"" is a great way to waste a day. Clocking in at just over six hours, it's a fun movie to just sit back and watch on a sick day or a Saturday with nothing going on. With an all-star cast, it tells the story of the end of the world, King style. When the majority of the Earth is wiped out by a mysterious plague, the remaining survivors form two factions: one led by a kind old woman, the other led by some strange demon. What ensues is the final battle of good and evil done with tact, and very exciting. This is one of the best King adaptations."
5,The director tract made this worth owning,"Not the best movie production of a Stephen King work, butcertainly not the worst. And by far his best novel. A collectorsmust."
5,The best Stephen King adaptation yet!,"This film was excellently done, cramming as much of the book onto the screen as possible without arriving at a gibberish mess. The whole cast was excellent (including Molly Ringwald)! The interpretation never strayed far from the original words of the master of horror; the few times it wandered off left me with a feeling of satisfaction rather than disappointment. After all, have you seen the size of that novel?? Six hours of video is right on the mark for the the story we were given to work with! Bravo!!"
3,"Wonderful book, but butchered in the movie","I've read the long version of The Stand well over 20 times. It's always been one of my favorites. I was highly disappointed in the movie, however. I felt there was too much changed from the book. Little things made such big gaps in the story line. I watch the movie often, but each time, it makes me so angry I have to go back and read the book. Molly Ringwald didn't fit well as Fran. Harold Lauder's character was poorly done. Nadie just wasn't Nadine. The only 3 characters that were well suited, I think, were Stuart Redman, Nick Andros and Tom Cullen. Someday, I would love to see this one redone in the manner in which the book carries it."
3,Good until the last hour and a half,"Yes, it had that made-for-tv feel to it but it was good up until the last hour and a half in the video. Suddenly it was all computer graphics (and horrid ones at that) and the plot seemed very rushed near the end to the point it made everything up to that point seemed ruined. Kind of like taking 3 hours to build something and 30 minutes to destroy it. A good rental at most."
3,The Stand is hampered by a made-for-tv feel,"The Stand, a tale of the end of the world, will certainly satisfy most fans of Stephen King, but will disappoint those hoping for an adventurous post-apocalyptic thriller. My feelings for this film go in-between. The budget for this film was high, at somewhere around 28 million dollars, and the first 90 minutes are spectacular in showing society crumble, but then the film itself starts to crumble in the conclusion with a very poor ending after a great start. If anything, most of Stephen King's books require huge budgets and should be made for the big screen."
3,Not Widescreen,"Although I am generally satisfied with this DVD, it said nowhere on the description that this was NOT the Widescreen Version. They still make Full Screen?????)The seller was very prompt, and I have NO problems with them, but I AM dissatisfied that this did not state ANYWHERE that this was the Full Screen version.I looked on the box, and even there it is almost invisible. Why are the Widescreen Versions over $30. more?I have read most of the other reviews, and adding my `two cents', feel that this movie is terrific. I did not read the book, but everyone knows that in a book, you are free to make the characters `your own' by way of your own imagination. I feel that under the conditions of the movie as a ""stand"" alone, the characters were well written and acted, and the story complete."
4,The Stand is origional,"The movie versian of Stephen Kings greatest work needed alot of work, but with the budget allowed and the visuals allowed through todays modern censurship laws,(ie..The discovery channel can show more gore than a TVMA rated Stephen King flick) The movie was good. I enjoyed how spread out the format of the storyline was, Imagine if you would the whole book put into movie mode. Your talking at least six more hours of movie. No one has that much time to spend with movie. Great Job Steve. The storyline was kept true to the book. The made for television scenery was pretty realistic. The acting was fair. No More Rob Lowe, or Molly Ringwald, for top notch storylines such as this. Lets give this one a well deserved dvd collectors spot on the shelf. I have made my Stand."
5,good vs evil!!!,this is the best Stephen King book and movie. it is so well done and it keeps you involved throughout the whole movie. i love most of King's movies but this is my favorite.
2,could have been better,I received the dvd in a very timely manner i was very pleased with that however the quality if the dvd was very poor i expected better quality and wonder if i could of gotten better quality from a used dvd
2,Never read the Book.,I know that if I had read the book this movie would have been better to me. I have always been a big fan of Stepehen Kings movies but I thought the acting and characters were awefull in this film. From what Ive heard when talking to people that have read the book they say that the onscreen performances in this movie are nearly perfect. So while I didnt like the devil character he may very well have been do a great job. So if you read the book you should definately purchase this DVD becuase you will most likely love the adaptation. If you havent read the book this movie may come off very cheesy.
1,not at all like the book,"I truly didnt enjoy the movie compared to the book. So much is out of proportion compared to the book. Alot of the characters are not the way I imagined them at all. Its a movie worth watching, but if you want to experience the stand, read the book. Trust me"
1,Garbage!,"The most important and most interesting elements (to me) from the novel are missing. The casting is all wrong, which leads to the weak, unconvincing acting. From the way these characters act, you'd think they were going on a fun-filled trip to Disneyland. They don't act as if a plague has wiped out most the population. Poor all around. One of King's best novels is ruined by a TV adaptation."
2,"M-O-O-N, THAT SPELLS LAME!!!!!!!!!","Sorry King, nice try but no cigar. Looks like TV had to cutback on necesarry sex and violence just to make it a PG rated hunk of X-Files abstract. This movie could have worked...COULD have..but just turns out to be flat and boring and far too long...Rob Lowe however gave the only worthy perfomance...Lame FX and even worse acting make this a stink and a half. STAND in the corner King, FOR SHAME!!!!!"
1,Nooo! The crappiest mini-series King has ever made!,"Sorry, but I disagree with most of ya. The series didn't need to be as long as the book, but it was. Many scenes were unnecessary and boring! The novel was a lot better. I would not even recommend this movie to the biggest Stephen King fan."
1,Waste of time and money,"Well, I had just finished reading 'The Stand' for the first time and I thought I'd wrap up the experience by watching the movie. This thing is four ninety minute tapes. I made it through th efirst tape, and ten minutes of the next tape before I turned it off. My advice, stick to the book and save your money. The movie is pablum!"
2,You got to be kidding!,"Good review Lauren. I agree completely. Considering King is such an enormous phenonmenon you'd think they would take a book like The Stand, which is amazing, and do a grand movie production with good acting, good special effects, and good directing. This movie has none of that. It's a sappy, corny piece of junk that does nothing but degrade the book. The book was so powerful and the movie was so boring! I was looking foward to a good relationship with Stu and Franny and got zip. Molly Ringwald (?) was a LOUSY Franny!One thing about this story (book or movie). Did anyone notice that in the midst of the whole ""good versus evil"" thing that the heros of the story had nothing to do with vanquishing the evil? It was merely an insider (Trashcan Man) and the ""hand of God"". The heros from the Free Zone did nothing whatsoever! Strange."
3,Not as good as the book,"I saw the movie BEFORE I read the book. The movie has very little similarities with the book. I liked the movie okay, but it is definately aunfair representation of the book:)"
2,why is it broken?,the case is broken (very broken)... and I know it didn't happen in the mail... if you don't care to check and you don't care about the product your shipping out... then how would you expect the customer to think you care about them?
1,Read The Book Instead,"...and if you have read the book, please don't waste your time with this movie. ""The Stand"" is one of the greatest horror books of all time, (and my favorite book). The movie is horrible. Horrible !!! The plot, the acting, the actors, the directing, even the lighting !!! ... a dumb B movie at best that could never do justice to such a great book. Sorry Gary Sinise, I love you in other stuff and it's not your fault, you're probably the best part of the movie.What could have been turned into the greatest apocolyptic movie of all time was instead made into a version so watered down it's almost unrecognizable.Re-read the book instead, and if you're looking for a good apocolypse on DVD ... rent or buy ""The Day After Tomorrow"" instead.Ugh this movie was bad. Shockingly bad.*shakes head in disbelief*"
1,Very Upset Customer!!,"I purchased a copy of the ""stand"" by Stephen King. The movie was in VHS form, which was Ok. However, the movie was suppose to have 4 tapes (which is the entire movie). However, I only received part 1 and part3. I was very displeased. I then, notified the seller of the matter. He said he apologized for the problem and that he would send me the other parts or refund my money back to me in full. But to this day, I am still waiting for money or tapes. Please do something about this matter. I will, from now on, think again before purchasing anything from Amazon.Com.Please make this right. Thank You. Melissa Ashton"
1,Great themes and plot...bad movie,"This movie was very mediocre. It was unneccesarily long, over 6 hours. Many scenes could have been removed to enhance the continuity and coherence of the movie. Also, The Stand was more like a movie made by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. It's more of a religious movie than a science fiction or horror movie. The cinematography comes nowhere close to an actual film, one can obviously tell it was made for TV. And finally, the characters and the roles they played were not believable. They seemed so fake and artificial. I was very disappointed with how this movie was constructed. I recommend not wasting 6 hours on it."
5,"""M-O-O-N, That spells 'Oh, My God, What a great movie'""!","If you have never seen this movie, buy it now! I love the music, the actors, the effects, the story, and everything else. I am planning to buy the soundtrack as soon as possible. I watched this whole movie in one day! I have owned it for 2 days now, and have already seen it twice. I feel bad whenever i'm not around to see Stu, Frannie, Ralph, Larry(baby, can you dig your man), and Glenn. I absolutely loved the depth of the character Nadine Cross. Laura san Giacomo is an awesome person. Jamey Sheridan had that evil glint in his eye. And Molly Ringwald was amazing. I can't say enough for this movie except, that it I should have been able to rate it like sixty-thousand stars! ""God, Help us to STAND!"""
3,The Stand on DVD,"This DVD set was somewhat disappointing. The DVD packaging was in poor condition. Also, while I also bought two other Stephen King TV mini-series on this same order, this was the only one not provided in widescreen format. I wish this had been noted in the product description. The DVD does play fine and looks decent (but since it is replacing an old VHS version it would, of course, look better). The other two sets were far more satisfying."
3,"I liked the book, but this interpritation, eeeeeeehhhhhhhha","Not exectly bad, but,...not exactly good eitherbut"
4,"""We are dead, and this is hell""","I just recently read the Complete and Uncut edition of ""The Stand"", and I thought I might take a look at the 1994 mini-series of it. Just like everything that's adapted from a book, it left certain things out and the effects were cheap...but CGI was new back then.Following a deadly plague that kills most people, the survivors of the plague have a dream about a black woman named Abagail Freemantle (""Most people 'round here just call me Mother Abagail"") calling people to her. The survivors also have dreams about ""The Walkin Dude"", a.k.a. Randall Flagg. Some people join with the 106-year-old Freemantle in Boulder, while others join up with Flagg in Las Vegas (the modern-day Sodom). Basically, it's about the struggle between good and evil with people caught in the crossfire."
4,Good Book to Movie Adaptation!!,"Anyone who reads the book before watching this movie is going to be somewhat disappointed. Well, take into consideration that the book is over 1100 pages, and it is filled with detail. That would be quite difficult to make into a movie, even an 8 hour one. The movie had a great mood to it. It's just one of those films that leaves you feeling a little creeped out. The acting was pretty good. Gary Sinise, Molly Ringwald, and Rob Lowe played their roles very well as far as I was concerned. I was disappointed with the way the Darkman (aka Randall Flagg) turned out to be on screen. He was very creepy in the book, but on film he came across pretty much as being a joke. The plague itself was spookier than Flagg turned out to be. Overall, I felt that this movie followed along pretty closely with the book. However, the book (as in most cases) was better, so if you don't want to be disappointed, I'd recommend watching the film first."
1,Not as good as the book---,"---and the book is the weakest thing King has written. At least in the novel King is able to take us inside the minds of the dozens of characters who populate this never-ending story. The film is only able to present each character's ticks (if that guy had said M-O-O-N spells whatever one more time, my foot was going to go through the TV!!!) rather than present them to us as real people.To be fair, Gary Sinise does his considerable best, and Laura San Giacomo manages to overcome the scraps of character she has to deal with. But what actor alive could possibly play Randall Flagg? Certainly not the unfortunate in this movie.The faults of the series are the faults of the book: Overlong, Pretentious, Predictable, Overly Convinced That It Is Conveying Some Kind Of Message About Good And Evil. Sadly, the virtues of the book are nowhere in evidence. Namely King's amazing ability to create living breathing characters that engage our attention and affections."
2,Buyer BEWARE!,"I was surprised that my DVD was in the wrong format for U.S. viewing, be careful, the sellers don't care."
3,The book that beats all,"I felt the book went deep into the world today, and the fears we all have. This book opened my eyes to how much I take for granted. If I could write one piece of work after my favorite aurthor, it would be Stephen King."
4,One of the best suspense screenplays I've ever seen!!!,In my point of view this was a good movie and had me thinking of what would be happening next and I found myself thinking of what our world would turn into (perhaps just a place with no human life at all) if we do not take care of it. If you're a Stephen King's fan you'll really like the movie (specially the very first part).Stephen King's novels are wonderfully written and when they have become sreenplays they are normally good in the first part but the second one usually lacks of something so do not become so critic on the second part if you really want to have a good time.Also I would certainly recommend reading the novel to have a different perspective of the plot.
3,Good Book,Notice i said good book! the DVD doesnt do the book justice! skip it and just read the book.
1,sucks!!!!!!!!!,dont mention i cant watch this in the usa...now want me to pay to ship it back?????????????????? just not right!
5,The Stand,The VHS came Brand New in the box! Stephen King is ALWAYS worth it and this is the best of his works!
5,the best,"now i'm not a King fan but when i saw this movie i couldn't help but watch the other one's, and read all his books this is a must see"
4,"Great bunch of actors, great plot, cheezy ending","Everything except the ""hand of god"" coming in to save the day was stunning. The special effects weren't over done, the development of characters was excellent(Kudos to Corin Nemec - remember Parker Lewis CAN lose in this one), and the extra features on the DVD such as the making of and commentary audio track definitely make it a welcome addition to any collection. Besides, how many other DVDs can boast a 6 hour+ movie on one disc?"
2,What Were They Thinking?,"Stephen King's The Stand is a novel of such epic proportions that it cannot possibly be turned into a move or mini-series. As hard as the producers of this mini-series tried, all they accomplished was to prove that it couldn't be done. They just had to leave too much out.What's really an enigma is the casting. The producers clearly made an effort to get top-notch actors, but that's all they did. They didn't seem to take into consideration the tiny little fact that the actor they signed might not fit the part. Gary Sinese is a great actor, no doubt about it, but as hard as he might try, he can't play a tall, lanky mid-40s good-ol-boy Texan named Stu Redman. The same goes for Molly Ringwald. Can that redhead possibly be convincing as the teen-aged, blond-haired Franny? I don't think so. Rob Lowe as Nick? Don't even get me started on that one.I wanted to like this film. I really did, but I found nothing but disappointment after disappointment in it."
3,"Read the book, it's worth it.","Let me say right off that The Stand is my favorite novel, and having read it several times I was hoping for a lot from the movie. Therefore, I tried to watch it with a positive attitude, but I must admit it was lacking the character depth (and some of the characters) that made the book so great. Where was Rita? She was a driving force for Larry, and she should have been in there somewhere. And Joe! He was such an interesting character, and yet he had about 5 minutes of screen time. The biggest mistake they made was casting Corin Nemic as Harold. He was supposed to be a genius, not a nerd, and he was fat. There were pluses, though. Rob Lowe was excellent as Nick Andros, and I had high expectations for him as he is my favorite character. Jamey Sheridan was acceptable as Flagg, though he wasn't exactly as I pictured him. The ending still left me in tears. If you liked the book, then you probably shouldn't see the movie. There are just too many missing elements."
2,Beware of buying vhs tapes,"I know for the price I paid, I shouldn't complain. They delivered in decent time. The problem is, the tape is degraded and the sound and picture quality are very poor. Great movie, I am just disappointed that due to the poor quality of the VHS copy I received, I can't enjoy watching it."
2,The Stand - DVD,"I bought the movie after I finished the book. Stick with the book!!! This (TV) movie is sooo bad. What were they thinking! Granted, it was 1994. I think they should re-write and remake this mini-series with today's technology. Of course no movie is as good as the book!"
4,Funny and Strange,This is a story of a young girl trying to find her own plaace in the world and all the odd and strange things she encounters in her search.
2,Not his best work,"Hedges liked to try new things, but never really sounded ""New Agey"" except for this album. There are a couple of good songs, but if you are looking to buy your first Hedges album, you might try Aerial Boundries, Breakfast in the Field, or Oracle. Live on the Double Planet is also fantastic. This is the only Hedges disc I own that really never impressed me."
1,"Wishing there was an ""undo button"" to correct this travesty.","There is no need to drag on about just how underwhelming The Road to Return is. This is the only Hedges album I have not loved. After so many gems, I didn't even think twice about ordering this high priced import; much to my dismay. Unless you are a huge hedges fan and simply wish to complete your library of his work, pass this album over. If you are simply searching for a collection of great music; look toward Live on the Double Planet, Taproot, or Oracle."
3,so-so Doesn't work in Vista,"I tried this game in Vista and I could not do the single races, only the tournaments. I liked the racing, the graphics are a little dated, but it has really cool cars in it. Some of these I've never raced in anything else. Very arcade like, in that if you hit a phone pole it slows your car down and damages some random part that may or may not be on the front of the car. B-"
3,Different but Frustrating,"The hero, Lord Nevil Browning was so much more likeable than the heroine Lady Colby Mannering. I guess it was the author's intent to have the reader get frustrated by her refusal to admit she even liked Nevil. He tried to be kind to her even though he had not been kind to her on their first meeting.But it was a cold blooded pact they made and Colby was determined to keep herself from feeling anything for Nevil. An heir and his freedom for Nevil and money to restore her home and take care of her family for Colby was what they wanted.The side characters seemed interesting but never fleshed out much. The Paris intrigue and insane man gunning for them in England was hard to follow. An ok read, interesting premise but not a keeper."
5,Behind the Screen reveals the real Wizard,"Behind the Screen is full of anecdotes and wisdom from people I've heard of and people I haven't, but all of them have a Christ-centric worldview and a desire to excel at their craft.Most essays were sharp and gripping, especially for non-fiction (to a fiction-loving, motion picture guy.) Having read quite a few of the ""Christians-in-Hollywood"" books, BTS provides the most chewable nuggets and real-world applications, even for those of us who will never be Hollywood-bound."
4,Wooden Blocks,"When we opened this package with our son and dumped the blocks out there were two pieces of styrofoam each about 1 inch in depth. One of the pieces fit the entire length of the container the other piece was about the size of a block. The blocks and frame are sturdy and can be fun to build with. As far as educational, the blocks might help with kids understanding more about structures. My son however has not really played with them since the end of December and it is now half way through January."
5,Great gift for my kids,"I gave these blocks to my kids (5 - girl, and 3 - boy), and they have gotten hours of play out of them! I am so impressed with the structures they build. Today they built The Great Wall of Their Room across their floor. I can't wait to get them more Melissa and Doug blocks to increase the building potential."
5,A great choice if you're looking for high-quality blocks,"These are beautifully made blocks, well finished without rough edges or other problems. And blocks are one of the best toys out there for small (and not-so-small) children to build creativity, spatial reasoning, and the beginnings of mathematical thinking. The price on these is extremely fair for the quality, and much better than many I've found. A five-star product from a five-star toy producer."
2,Overcompensating bombast,"Typically epic release in this subgenre, here from the Swedish rock-progsters. And by epic I mean overstuffed and overlong. While not as cloying as say, some of Aryeon's output, the album still suffers many of the same character flaws mucking up the modern progressive rock genre. Diverse and melodically ambitious, much of the rocking just feels tepid and a lot of the progression just overly theatrical at the expense of sincerely engaging. Still, enough will work to appeal to that small demographic who appreciates their rock aggressively orchestrated. The few songs which do translate an unabashedly power-cheese vibe without overcooked vocals, clunky interludes, or overworked instrumentation could appeal to many more for their bold, albeit partially cliched melodic strokes."
2,eh,"POS is an amazing group but this album stinks. Ive have loved all their previous work, 12:5 being my favorite. The music is fine on BE and the concept is fine. I think its all those samples. POS cant sample. Don't get me wrong I love samples just not from POS. the whole 30 second orgasam is terrible. The samples are completly in the way. I recommed a good listen before you purchase. You may love it but if your looking for a band that knows how to sample check out floater's burning sosobra. Please excuse any spelling errors."
1,Not worth the wait,"I'm a fan of music and over 78 minutes or so, there's less than half that's composed of music. The rest is spoken word and sound effects.Not worth the wait if you're a fan that was waiting since the last album. Also, it's not heavy and it doesn't flow. Concept, perhaps, but there's no music and the lack of flow is annoying. You can't turn up any tracks on the radio because there's no realy music.Pass over this one, unless you're looking to complete your collection just because.This should really have been a Gildenlow solo project and not a PoS record."
2,Boring indeed,"I think the album may have interesting narrative or philosophy behind it, and you know what? I don't care really, cause the music is random, chopped up, boring. The music do not engage you in whatever philosophical endevore POS has gone into, I dont feel it anyway, music should speak louder than words, i think the music tell's you alot more than the text that follows it. It's one of the albums that you don't really remember after listening to, it's just not strong and doens't envoke strong emotions in me."
3,Missing one important band....,"Great soundtrack, but in the movie you could hear Disco Tex and the Sexolets, but not on this."
5,Wonderful Book!,"I started reading the book over the weekend and found I just loved it! In fact, I was very sorry to come to the end of it. I have never read such a wonderful running book before. I have a shelf full of training books and how to books reagarding running, and I'm glad that I have them, but this book filled the WHY I run so well. And not only that, it opened the door to other runners and what has happened to them. It was as if there were 26 seperate books within this book. I just can not say enough about it. If you are looking for a great gift to give to someone who is a runner, or who is thinking about running, this is it. I am also ordering several for people that don't run. Grab a cup of coffee and get ready for a great weekend when you get this book."
5,great read!,"I took my time reading this book - and I have my favorite chapters - all in all it was a great book. There are very moving stories in it and a lot of humor too. As a cancer survivor myself, I was pleasantly surprised to find two chapters, two of the authors stories about cancer survivors. Both were uplifting and really encouraged me to start running again. And I enjoyed reading about George, his day to die?I'm buying a few copies of this book to give as gifts. I hope to see more from this author."
5,Start to Finish Brilliant,"Highly underrated album. A daring electronic venture by U2, high marks on creativity, a sonic soundscape vastly different than anything they'd done before, exploring new sounds and mastering alternative ways of musical expression --- but having said that, if you're not open to hearing music that's not played on the radio 1000 times a day, polished & overly-commercialized, then you likely will not appreciate the brilliance of this album and should pass on it...but boy would you be missing out on what music and art are truly all about!"
2,More like a demo CD than a real one....,"This is undoubtedly U2's worst album. It feels like a homemade demo CD, or perhaps it's leftovers from the vastly superior Achtung Baby. Regardless, it's not a particularly good CD, poorly crafted, written, and performed. The first single, Numb, feels like a backing track without any enhancement. While this can work sometimes in music, it doesn't here. It ends up feeling cheap. Lemon is a little better, but still has that cheap, sinking feeling. The best songs on the album are Stay, Faraway, So Close (from the Wim Wenders film), The First Time (a lovely ballad), and the great closer, The Wanderer. The Wanderer is a great U2 song, with stunning lead vocals by Johnny Cash and a great, brooding lyric that reads like Cash wrote it himself. The CD booklet cover art is stunning as well, like the cover art in Achtung Baby and Pop. If you're a U2 completist, pick it up. If not, you can safely ignore it (except for The Wanderer)."
4,Taoist Inner View of the Universe and the Immirtal Realm,"In this book, the world's most prolific Taoist writer (more than 40 titles in English) describes the complex and profound spiritual realm in a refreshingly straight forward manner. Master Ni explains that the ancient Taoist turned their focus inward to explore the ""inner"" universe of spirituality. This very metaphysical book details what the author and pervious generations of Taoist Masters have discovered about the ""Immortal Realm"" from their own expirences. Those interested in the authors backround (spiritual linage) and/or perfer less metaphysical and more scientific aspects of Toaism, should read the authors excellent "" Tao - The Subtle Universal Law and the Integral Way of Life."""
3,Ronald Reagan as a cowboy with Barbara,"Cattle Queen of Montana is a decent Western, but not as good as I hoped. On the positive side - the scenery is great, the action is good, and the cast is solid. Ronald Reagan is actually pretty good as a cowboy, and Barbara Stanwyck does a nice job portraying a strong Western woman. On the negative side - the plot is predictable, the bad guy is kind of lame, and the actors portraying the native Americans are not very believable. The special effects are not too good either. Overall, I enjoyed the film, but as a fan of Westerns it is only decent."
2,great scenery,"Typical 1950's western yarn. The plot is very simple, the acting is actually very good.. What saves this movie is the great scenery of montana. All and all it is a good movie to have in your collection."
2,Disappointing,"After being so impressed by Tango and Angels Running, I was SO ready for another great album. But, Strangers World just didn't do it for me. It was missing the interesting rhythms of the other two, and, frankly, there was nothing on it that grabbed at my feelings the way I know she can. I've put it away and then tried again several times, but it's still the earlier two I reach for!"
1,Not worth the money,"When hooking to PC it worked a couple times and now doesnt work at all. Picture quality is terrible indoors unless there is ALOT of natural light. If you use the flash it is either too much light or not enough light. Pictures are blurry, whited out or orangey. Lots of features but that doesnt justify the cost when the picture quality is terrible."
1,Bad,The worst ending in the history of motion pictures. I don't think this should be viewed during black history mounth.
3,Language is vulgar,The movie has an excellent point but the language gets in its way. Children should never be allowed to use that kind of language. It doesn't uplift. It brings you down.
4,Fresh,"Definitely one of my favorite hood classic movies. Like real hood. If it's not a classic, it should be. It's up there with Menace II Society and Boyz In The Hood, classic hood movie-wise."
5,Must See,"The previous reviewers have pretty much summed it all up. This is a great American movie. The theatrical release completely passed me by, and I only recently discovered 'Fresh' by reading the reviews on Amazon. Buy this movie, it will have you rapt with attention. The story is deep and the details many, so much so you will need more than one viewing to take it all in. Great performances all around."
5,My all-time favourite film,"The acting is superb, the plot keeps you on the edge of your seat, and you will lie awake for nights on end, haunted by this movie"
3,Very stereotypical but believable,"The young man starring in the movie is a very good actor and the story was good. It depicts some harsh realities facing some urban children and serves as a look at how some people actually live. It also could serve to help those concerned who are outside of the loop ie, social workers, police officers, etc..."
4,Classic... hand's down...,"This movie is an classic hood flick thats a ""Must Have."" Well put together, and well directed. Plot is flawless. This movie is also very hard to find in stores"
2,Exciting Peformance Poorly Recorded,"The first thing I noticed when I started listening to this recording was how closely the solo violin was recorded (and both soloists in the double concerto). The violin is given no breathing room by the microphones. Consequently, I never listen to this recording. It is one of the worse sounding recordings I own. What a shame, because it's my favorite performance of these pieces."
3,Good but THERE IS BETTER,"This recording of Bach's Violin Concertos LACKS the excitment and tasteful style in Bach Concertorecordings of JASCHA HEIFETZ and also ITZHAK PELMAN. Listen to JASCHA HEIFETZ's fabulous musical phrasing in his recording and you will see the latter is much more talented in interpreting Bach. This recording almost sounds like an imitation of Heifetz's recording- tempo is very fast, however unlike Heifetz's, the artists on this album are unable to carry out the true lyrical passages of Bach without exaggerating them. Get the Heifetz or Perlman recording and listen to the difference!"
1,Wrong Key,I wouldn't say that this CD is the best... it's the worst! Don't buy it. The whole CD was played in the wrong key. Everything was played half-step lower.
2,HORRIBLE Sound!,"I love the soloists, I love the orchestra, I love the performances and, of course, I love these concerti! But WHY did the engineers, or ANYONE who listened to the takes and did the final editing think this was a good recording??? The mikes are placed practically INSIDE the violins!!! It has the most strident and harsh sound. This recording reminds me of the early days of DDD recordings that were so awful. I have alot of Harmonia Mundi recordings and they are usually stellar in the recording area. This one misses the mark by light years. Sad, as Mr Manze and Ms Podger play their hearts out. You could by this recording as a good example of bad miking and recording technique. Might help someone studying to be a recording engineer learn what NOT to do."
2,"Disappointing, terribly recorded, save your money.","Disappointing, terribly recorded. The microphone work is unforgivable. The violins are shrill, yet murky, the rest of the ensemble muddy. The pace, particularly of first concerto much too fast. There are several superior recordings of this material: Monica Huggett's is similar but far superior. Save your money."
3,Absurdly Fast,"At such absurd tempi, no matter the quality of violonists involved, everything is treated in a light manner and the music suffers a great deal. This kind of interpretation, scratchy and horribly fast, has given a bad name to the otherwise great merits of HIP musicians.For HIP performances of Bach's surviving violin concerts, I recommend Simon Standage/English Concert and Elizabeth Wallfisch/Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment.There is no non-HIP performance that I could really recommend. All those I've listened to suffer greatly from the flaws of late romanticism when performing older music. DO NOT get yourself impressed by the ""big names"" involved (Perlman, Grumiaux, Stern, Oistrakh). They ""explore"" the unexistent romantic side of this composer. Yet, how could a fugal line, a counterpoint, the stones upon which Bach constructed his magnificent oeuvre, how could they have ANYTHING whatsoever in common with Romanticism?"
3,Bach on speed,"If you dislike the brutal articulation of Andrew Manze, the lack of sensitivity in his athletic speed, I recommend you to go for another, less sensational fiddler, also he original instruments and I bet much better historically informed: Sigiswald Kuijken.His unmannered and stylish performances you'll find by searching Amazon:Johann Sebastian Bach: Violin Concertos, BWV 1041-1043 - Sigiswald Kuijen / La Petite Bande."
5,A once in a lifetime disk,"I have heard a lot of cds and performances of the bach violin concertos, but never one like this. This is some of the most ingenious violin playing that i have ever heard, Andrew Manze's gypsy style of violin playing really brings out things in the concertos that i never even imagined to be there. This is a truly fantastic cd - buy it, i insist."
3,expected it to be better,"This is the story of Asia, and Duane. Duane is a big time football player who always had a crush on the older Asia. Asia had a bad first marriage, so she was hesitate about staring a relationship with someone like Duane. The two end up getting married. They try to keep their marriage working, but have to deal with Duane's mother, who don't like Asia. I liked the story ok, but felt it was missing something. I found Duane characther to be a tad bit arrogance, and annoying. Pretty good."
5,Outstanding,Undra E. Biggs is truly a talented writer. Her second novel is even better than the first. I was able to finish the book in one day. The story and its characters are so real that you feel as if they are your personal friends. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a true love story filled with ups and downs.
4,Pleasant and light - subdued and then enlivened.,"I hesitated before aquiring this cd. It has now played through three times on my computer cd player, and I only received it yesterday! You won't regret ordering this cd. The sounds are light and alive, but never overwhelming. Romanesca does not try to ""prove"" itself with this record. The music speaks for itself, with low moods displayed as such, and as said, high moods never so high, loud and fast that you feel you must turn down your player. Now that's a rare cd!"
3,Beautiful pictures with some great recipes,My mother is Swedish. We grew up with celebrating Swedish Christmas and eating lots of Swedish baked goods. This is a great book for pictures and explaining Swedish customs. But the recipes are hit and miss. I am still on the look out for a great Swedish recipe book with all my childhood memories...
2,Not very scary,"I was disappointed in this book. I'm a fan of R.L. Stine so I picked this book because of his reputation. However, the stories did not go over well on the 7 and 9 year old boys that I had hoped to entertain. We tried really hard to make them scary - sitting around a campfire at night and reading in a scary voice but it just wasn't possible. They didn't find the stories scary and at times, I would skip to the end of a story because the boys were completely bored with it. If you have kids that really like scary stories, this is not the book to buy. They will likely get bored of the stories as well."
3,"Get ""Fact of Fiction"" instead","This album is nothing great. ""Fact or Fiction"" (her first album) is much, much better. This album has a fake sort of feel too it, like it was rushed and over-produced. It has no real soul or feeling to it (except a few rare moments like when Emily Sailers of the Indigo Girls comes in on ""Following My Compass""). It actually gets downright cheesy at times. They are a couple good songs, but this is not the album if you're new to Kristen Hall. I bought this album without listening to it assuming that she'd be as good as she was on her first album. Man was I let down. Her raspy voice and acoustic guitar are much better on ""Fact or Fiction"" where everything sounds more natural, creative, and unique."
2,Pleasant but unmemorable,"I first bought Kristen Hall's ""Fact and Fiction"" on a whim after listening to a few tracks on a store listening station. I wasn't disappointed. Kristen has a raspy but pleasant voice and sings wonderful folk-tinged songs with real heart.""Be Careful What You Wish For..."" is more produced and consequently the worse for wear. The songs aren't as catchy either and all start sounding the same. This was a problem with previous albums like ""Fact and Fiction"" too, but is even more pronounced here. This is one of those albums that you listen to for a pleasant background noise, then when it's over, you can't remember any of it."
3,Say it with Sign Baby SIgn Language,"I will have to give this DVD a thumbs down for toddlers. The program is too fast paced for even an adult to grasp the message. There are only a few signs that they show children actually doing them, the rest are done by adults. I think Talking Hands and Signing time series are much better because they go through the signs very slowly and show children doing the signs in many different settings. When I put my DVD player on slow speed, it was easier to comprehend the signs, but then the sound didn't work. My two year old lost interest before the first of seven segments finished."
5,WOW. Really Bangin',"I doscovered these guys by mistake, actually. And what a mistake. These cats are HARD. I read that they're a cross between Mobb Deep and Camp Lo. I agree. Their lyrics and flows are HOT and the beats are always bangin. Their other album, Megadef is hot too. If you like hardcore hip hop you'll like these guys. Excellent album. Wish I could hear this kinda music on the radio instead of the normal garbage they play."
5,Wicked flows,"This CD is crazy wild! If you with the whole underground scene, you gotta pick up this one. Non stop hip hop from beginning to end, and some of the tightest flows I've ever heard. Rank right up there with J5 and Blackalicious.Don't miss this!"
5,"Bangin' On The War Drum, Pt. I","This is definitely THE most memorable Hip Hop album to have come out in 1998. It definitely has all the main ingredients of a stellar Hip Hop classic: dope beats, rhymes, and styles. The album continues to amaze me with each listen. Peep the lyrical stylings and unf**kable beats on songs such as ""Spies Like Us"" and ""Easy Back It Up"". I started to feel that Hip Hop music was beginning to falter into mainstream oblivion until I heard this dope LP (as well as other releases like the Jurassic 5 EP and Rasco full-length debut). Headz worldwide should definitely support this multi-talented crew and keep independent Hip Hop alive right into the next millenium. We are all in this together. One love!"
4,binary star,"binary star's ""masters of the universe"" is a timeless hip-hop classic. Period. Solid beats, solid flows delivered in that oh-so socially conscious underground style that will soon slap the mics out the hands of weak, ignorant artists like Jay-Z, Ludacris, or Missy Elliot. If you like Heiro, Living Legendz, or any of that ill underground stuff pick it up. Oh, and ""MC D"" is it? Kid, you're nothin'. I been wipin' the floor with flamboyant moronic punks like you since I was 12, kid. I produce, rap, and play guitar kid. You're NOTHING. Your idiotic comment about how rap is NOT about putting your 2 cents in and speaking on your perception is the stupidest thing I ever heard. You have no clue what you're talkin' about. How can you rip anybody on a mic listenin' to techno and havin' no clue about the definition of hip-hop. Once again- you're nothin'. Don't speak cuz your ""2 cents"" mean nothin'. FAIRY!"
2,I've heard way better.,"I bought this album after hearing their work on Fort Minor's recent release. The beats are less than innovative and, frankly, just don't hit very hard. The vocal styles aren't bad, just not my cup of tea, and the rhymes didn't show me much either. I'm guessing they learned quite a bit in the last few years b/c their work on The Rising Tied was far better."
4,valley boys,"i give the lyrcs five stars - i give the flows four stars - i give the beats three starsalthough they have nice lyrics, they have a retro style. so they should be called styles of at least 3 or 4 years ago."
5,Wonderful Story,loved the characters. I would not characterize this book as a story I would say a saga. If you are into books that spans a lifetime frame or has over 400 pages to get you into the character it's an awesome book.
2,Not what it use to be,It had been quite a time ago that I purchased St. John Bay Rum previous to this purchase. It was much more aromatic and the scent lasted longer back then. I will go back to Royall Bay Rum for less money and same lasting power. Too bad they had to ruin a good thing.
1,Formula Change?,"Seems like they added a funny smell that didn't used to be there. I will try and find something else that has a more ""bay"" smell."
5,Biased but honest!,"I know & love Mary and her husband, however I can in all honesty recommend adding this book to your fine art library, whether you are an artist or an art collector. She captures her subjects with remarkable finesse. You, the viewer, can sense her connection with the models - she has captured the true natures of her subjects on paper, in a professional and skillful manner. And, if you can, meet her and walk with her through a crowd, as she talks about the faces that interest her. You'll understand the magic she has rendered!"
5,Every bit as good as the previous three.,Another Van Reid masterpiece. Although this book is more linear in storyline than the Marvelous Moosepath adventures it still has every bit of charm and whimsically drawn characters as they do.I found it very interesting in my own reading experience that upon completion of the book I found that only several days had passed in the life of Peter Loon. So many experiences in such a short time!Once again Mr. Reid delivers a fine story with absolutely no objectionable (mature themes and language) material and goodness knows that is rare these days.Buy it and let's all put Van Reid on the New York Times bestseller list in place of the dreck that usually winds up there... Maybe that's not a good idea as that appears to be the bottom of the cesspool of the literary world. Ah well...
5,Love it,The book is in great condition. just what i wanted to buy with the quantity and quality matched my needs.
2,I wanted to like this book,"I really wanted to like this book, but it has to be the most poorly written book I have read in many years. Doesn't the UC Press have editors? It's truly unbelievable. I enjoyed the case being made, but the poor argumentation and writing made it very hard to stay with or to feel sympathetic towards. It's a real shame."
5,"Fascinating, hilarious in places, inspiring","This is a great book. The writing is excellent. There's a lot of backhanded humor that had me laughing out loud in places. And the scientific, anthropological, sociological, and even Biblical details are fascinating and often mind-blowing. Just start reading this and you'll realize how little you know about sexual diversity, animal and human. The author's appeal for more rational approaches to sexual and gender diversity are inspiring, sensible, and long overdue. Definitely a must-read."
4,Very interesting,"Even though this book was over my head scientifically, I still found most of it very interesting. But, as others have pointed out, she seems politically motivated. She does, however, make you think."
3,my 2 cents,"This is obviously a budget conscious movie, 98% filmed on a soundstage with a small number of actors with a limited wardrobe (the outdoor shots look like a backlot). This VCI release on DVD has vibrant color and pretty good sound. The plot is predictable and a little cheesy but so what it's got Virgia Mayo one of my absolute favorites, So anything I get to see her in is OK by me. So Far I've had good luck with the DVD quality on all the VCI releases that I've purchased. Thanks."
5,Excellent book!,"This is an excellent book. Glueck integrates his story development along with and through his characters in a spellbinding way. The events unravel at an increasing rate and draw the reader into the action. While the story is a work of fiction, it's evident that the author has a tremendous amount of knowledge in the military, weapons, computer technology, and world events.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys fast-paced adventure, even though I'm not usually a 'war story' fan.Mr. Glueck, I'm looking forward to your next book."
2,like a plastic bag,"it works. period. but it is like wearing a plastic bag...no breathing at all. You get very sweaty when it is closed up.....it is only good for heavy rain protection, but nothing else. Better to spend a few more dollars and get a material that is both waterproof and breathes."
2,Columbia IBEX Rain Parka,The good thing about this parka? It is waterproof. Don't buy this parka if you plan to active. It does not breathe and it retains moisture. Sizing is not true to size. Buy one size smaller if you are still considering a purchase.
1,Breathable?,This rain jacket is not breathable. They say it is because they have two small holes under something on the front of the jacket. Right where my backpack shoulder straps go. I think you would stay drier without the jacket in the rain. I put it on and I was drenched inside. This is a jacket you throw on if your running to the store. Absolutely not for any serious outdoor activity like hiking.
4,Raincoats really waterproof,"Bought these raincoats for my 3 teenage sons. The sizing is really ample. (The large is really large.) They have been out in downpours and the parkers really are waterproof. They aren't full length, but that is clear in the description. My only concern is that they don't wrip too easily as they are not heavy (which makes them great for the spring/summer showers). So far, we have no problems with wripping."
5,Inner Sanctuary,"I have found Inner Sanctuary to be a wonderful tool to use with individuals who are beginning to use meditation as a part of his or her daily routine. Finding one's own inner sanctuary can literally be a life saving and life changing event. Today's world is fully of rush and chaos. Inner Sanctuary helps each of us find that inner peace we long for. Once we've learned the techniques they can be used anywhere and at any time. It is soothing, peaceful and works every time! I also play this CD during the energy treatments I give because it aids my clients in deep relaxation and helps to guide them to that inner core that is so important in healing. I highly recommend this CD to anyone seeking his or her inner sanctuary. Joyce Surbeck-Harris, PhD, www.7feathershealing.com."
4,A Perfect Tonic,"Sandy McDermott's CD ""Inner Sanctuary"" is the perfect tonic for inducing the relaxed state that wards off stress, or guides you gently into sleep. The music, Sandy's voice and timing as well as the lovely imagery all work together to create a truly tranquil experience. If it is a sense of peace you are seeking, I highly recommend this."
1,TOO SHORT,"Although she has a very soothing voice and the music is good, I am very disappointed in the short length of this CD!"
4,disturbing yet captivating,I couldn't put this down. I just could feel Marthas emotions. I was quite surprised with tne ending and I felt so sad. It was a very interesting book to read. The writing is fantastic. So true to life.
1,Don't Buy,This video is a mere 10 minutes long. It simply shows images of the very basic facts in every guidebook published about Cambodia.
5,good family entertainment.,The sellers at Amazon are just an amazing bunch of people. Thanks for the great service. The movie is really good. It is amazing that the boy is played by a guy who never got a chance to do much in the way of film roles.
2,Disappointed,"The Black Stallion establishes that the Black is an Arabian horse. So what is he doing in Africa?Besides this, it's too hard to swallow that a young boy could get from New York to Africa all by himself with no money. Then when he reaches his destination and finally gets the Black for his own, Alec just gives him up.What happened to their incredible bond? The horse that no one else could ride? Apparently it's not as important as letting the Black run around in an area that is not really his homeland."
4,Must have classic,I read all of Walter Farley's books as a kid and Mickey Rooney is great in horse movies. A must have horse movie for all ages!
3,The Black Stallion Returns - Not up to par,"I agree with Laurel962- This movie is nothing like the original. Actually, I think the Black Stallion books are much more culture-related and celebrate the grace and beauty of Arabia. But the two idiots in this movie, the Arabian bad guys, are just stupid. It was boring, too. Also, Kelly Reno didn't do a fantastic job, either. He was much more appealing in the original Black Stallion. A good flick for little kids, but mostly it's just dirt. I only gave it 3 stars because the Black was beautiful! He did look different though, I don't think it was the Black(Cass Ole)."
1,"Horrible show,","How could anyone in the right mind say this crap was funny? It's the most unfuuny thing iv'e ever seen in my entire life. It's so unbelievably annoying, It's maddening. And I thought it would be good based on the preview, which was funny, but god was I wrong.This show is a waste of money!!!"
5,GREAT,"This was awesome! I really enjoyed this series though I liked some characters more then others. While it is a little old it is well done, I particularly like the firts episode and the next one with Max Carrados; a blind but very observant detective."
2,Wrong impression,"When I read the title, I thought ""rivals"" was referring to Sherlock Holmes enemies. I did not think it referred to other detectives."
4,A Person is of More Value than the Whole World,"I can truly relate to the father. He apparently embodies an ideal Filipino who places a kin above anyone else. This is not say that Filipinos are family-centered, or in that sense, self-centered. The character displayed by the protagonist is nonetheless someone that anybody should highly regard.For some people, a dead person may lose significance. Yet, for a father who truly works hard for the living members of the family, remembering those who have passed away is simply an act of remembering those who are still alive. An act to be praised, isn't it?F. Arcellena has simply highlighted one of the most regarded identities of the Philippine Culture in this stunning masterpiece."
4,"Good Value, easy to work","Paid $6 for it with MIR. I put in the CD. Connected it to my modem. My computer upstairs with a wireless card can get the signal and does not lose the signal very often. Very easy set up, well worth the money."
5,Good for the price,This product was very affordable and has served the purpose that it was bought for. I initially had some trouble with the set up but I called the number and the guy was very helpful and patient. I have only had it for a short time and it is the first time that I bought this kind of product but so far I have no complaint.
3,Great router for the price,"First I'd like to say I haven't tried the WiFi on this router yet. Everything else seems pretty great for the price. Has many configuration and firewall settings if you need them. I'm only giving this 3 stars though because of these reasons: 1) I tried the DynDNS.org auto-update feature and it seemed to reboot continuously (all the lights would go out and come back on over and over) until I disabled it. 2) The firewall rules/virtual server pages are confusing until you realize some things you enter on the Virtual Server page appear automatically on the Firewall Rules page and you can't modify Virtual Server entries on the Firewall Rules page. 3) The log emailing feature doesn't seem to work correctly...sometimes it won't mail you for a couple days then suddenly you get flooded with emails. 4) You can't use MAC address filtering to assign a specific IP to a specific machine like you can on the SMC Barricade, D-Link, and other routers."
4,Tip for Mac users,"I've had this product for a few weeks and it has worked OK so far. If you're a Mac user, note that the setup/configuration software on the CD it comes with is for Windows only, and nowhere (that I could find) in the written instructions does it tell you what to do if you own a Mac. However, it is Mac-compatible; you can set it up through an internet browser. After some searching online, I found this solution:http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=264789which is similar to a solution buried in the more extensive setup instructions downloadable (in pdf form) from the TrendNet website."
5,Great Product!,"I was able to configure all of my products into one Network. I can even use my non-wireless DLink Router, that I had plugged into one of the 4-ports. I will recommend this model to anybody!"
2,Doesn't Last,The product was easy to install and worked well at first. Customer service is in a foreign land and very difficult to understand. The call took forever and didn't solve the issue. We replaced it with another brand and have been very happy with it.
1,This book has no substance and is mostly a chronology .,There seems to be no INSIDE STORY told here. Little more than what you would read in a newspaper. Evidently the arthur is bound by some Government legal oath which prevents him from writing anything of consequence. A piece of milk toast.
5,bluray,great price . i have been looking for this movie love the old titles. amazon has the best prices and selection. will order again
5,to be owned as MUST BE SEEN,this movie is one that marked in red everyone's mind when first seen so it was essential to have it in DVD since the VHS tapes unfortunetly don't keep the video nor sound quality. This is made in cheap country so the price isn't high but the movie is old and we just need to get back into this atmosphere of what will become our human life maybe in 100 years or so. What I love in this movie like all from that time is without big effects and explosion you can feel the sadness and tough time of living in this kind of era. It's like living in the twilight zone except it is close to reality we can come across.love it
4,The Future?,"Saw this movie when it was originally made and thought it was well done, sets you to thinking about what the future could become as we become more careless. Had to add it to my collection."
5,Classic,I don't really know what you would need out of a review for this except that the movie was great and still in it's original packaging.
1,review,"I ordered it and something came up on the screen saying I was getting it for free with order, so I cancel it on my orginal order and I never received it. I don't know what happened or what was going on."
3,READ THE BOOK,"This film completely fails to realize the potential of the book. Heston's ""acting"" ruins most of it. I hope someday this movie is redone by better actors and better direction."
2,Almost not even worth seeing for the memorable quote,"What attempted to be a commentary on the way society seemed to be going in the 70's, _Soylent Green_ turned out to have little more plot than a 70's porn, complete with the lounge music. Evidently, there was not much faith that the American public would waste its time going to a movie that was all commentary and no sex. Somehow, in the future the rights of women are reverted to little more freedom than they had in the dark ages...but I guess that's a turn-on, huh. And how do you explain there being so many people in Manhatten that they sleep on the steps, but are somehow too good for the streets? If you're looking for some mediocre acting and pretty girls, look no further than _Soylent Green_."
1,bad acting,"If it was not for the fact that I wanted to know what the comment about ""Soylent Green' on a Simpson's episode was refering to, I would have turned this off within 5 minutes. Perhaps the book was better.And why is is clasified as a horror movie? ( because of the bad acting?)"
1,connection problem,Disappointed! First movie was interrupted by connection problem. Amazon said to try later. I'll see what happens with the second movie.
4,Soylent,"Basically, it's a great film for it's time but it was kind of slow and boring for my taste. I like the futeristic part, and how the women are known as furniture. It's funny though it shows how women in the future world are still viewed not high as men are. The plot is good and somewaht obvious to people who seen enought films to know what Soylent Green is but overall, it's worth watching at least once. You can at least say you saw Soylent Green."
2,Review of Soylent Green DVD,I did watch this DVD but it kept stopping every few minutes and then resuming. This was quite disconcerting and now expected of a new DVD. I was disappointed in it. I'm sure not every DVD purchased here would do that but this one did.
4,good movie!,"I saw this movie a long time ago and really liked it. It doesn't have a lot of action, but it does have you hanging in to see what's going on. The ending is chilling! Great actors, too!"
5,Great Sci-Fi that's not overburdened with a bunch of special effects!,"Today's sci-fi movies are filled with cool special effects and subpar story lines. This is a great story with a thought provoking plot. Edward G. Robinson and Charlton Heston, both were in The 10 Commandments, are fantastic actors. I enjoyed this movie. I hope Hollywood, which is so fond of remaking superhero movies, would remake this one -without re-imagining it."
4,Worth Viewing,Check this movie out - you'll enjoy the acting and story. I was surprised this topic was being thought of back in the 1970's.
4,A SciFi Classic That asks the ? What is To Much.,"In today's world of loose morals and lack of Integrity this movie has chilling possibilities of becoming reality, far more so than when shot in the early seventies."
3,A little slow and unexciting,A little slow and unexciting. Hard to sit through. It was a little better years ago when I first saw it.
4,Not far from the Truth,I watched this many times in the past couple of years. Not far from the truth. That is all! :)
5,Soylent Green - Is this what 2022 will look like???,"Originally saw this movie in the 70's and wanted to see it again. Mostly remembered it as I saw it 40 years ago. But now that we're moving closer to 2022, and the economy is bad, are we looking forward to something like this in our future?"
5,soylent green,"This movie rocks, a verry interesting look a near future with poluted air and water and worst of all short food supplies. A murder mystery and the investigation by the corrupt central police, with a backdrop of poloution unfathomable over population and food riots. The most original opening credits of any movie,that brings you up to the start of the film.In the end with mystery solved and the heros dead or about to die we learn the only truth that maters WE ARE ALL SOYLENT GREEN!!"
4,A SF Gem,"I just want to mention a couple of overlooked items: the art direction and costume design remind me of Jean ""Moebius"" Girraud's work from the era. It's not surprising that Blade Runner comparisons are made given that its production design was also influenced by the french master. Also, I always find Leigh Taylor-Young captivating in this film. Any fan of big brown female eyes will be rewarded in their viewing of this classic SF film."
4,Good tehnical Si/Fi for the early 70's,Most critics feel this was a so-so film based on its rather flat and predictable story. I think the film is a reflection (the post-60s and start of the enviromental movement's concern for the planet) of its time. In context the film is actually pretty good. Edward G's last film!
2,Hard to watch this old movie with such horrible production quality,"I tried to watch this movie...heck it was free....but the horrible production quality and sappy acting made it easy to shut it down. Heston is at the very end of his leading man career and this movie really didn't play well into his skills. That horrible rug he wears is so noticeable!Some people may actually like this, but I couldn't stand it."
3,"This is not the future, and not even a good movie!","This movie does not portend the future. Unless, you are willing to believe that Halliburton is working on a plan to manipulate the food supply. Heston's acting is good. He plays a somewhat crooked cop, albeit one who is still trying to do right. The other actors are good as well. But the problem with this movie is the story. It is simply not gripping enough to enable buy in for the story's premise. As a result, the movie simply seems as little more than a half-baked effort. Watch it, if you have it. But do run out to get this one."
1,Right Up There With 'Planet of the Apes',"The Earth is overpopulated and ""Soylent Green"" is the name of a ""staple"" food made from human corpses. The problem is that nobody seems to know the ingredient list of this nasty little cracker... UNTIL our hero figures it out. But it's too late for him and for humanity because he is killed at the end of the film. Honestly, the film would have been better if he had died at the begining."
1,AUGHHHHBARF...CHEATED,"I FELT REALLY CHEATED VIEWING THIS FILM AND THE TIME IT TOOK FOR ME TO YAWN THROUGH.THE PROBLEM HERE IS THIS SCRIPT,IN WHICH THE FIRST HOUR SHOULD HAVE BEEN BURIED UNDER 100 POUNDS OF STEEL!THE BEST PART WAS THE LAST 15 MINUTES WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN IT'S BEGINNING.THIS HAS NONE OF THE EXCITMENT THAT ""BODY SNATCHERS""OR ""THE OMEGA MAN"" HAD.I FELT NO INTEREST OR CONCERN FOR ANY OF THESE CHARACTERS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF EDWARD G. ROBINSON'S WHO SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE MAIN CHARACTER.HE ALWAYS LOOKS PAINED IN HIS ROLES AND IN THIS HE HAS REASON.IN MOST OF THIS FILM BETWEEN YAWNS I KEPT WONDERING ""SO?"".AS I HAVE SAID..THE FAULT HERE IS A MEANINGLESS SCRIPT.SOOO...GO OUT AND ENJOY ANY OF THE THREE ""BODY SNATCHERS""INSTEAD."
3,Soylent Green DVD,"Impressively predictive of (what was then to be) the future - apart from the primitive communications technology - of a world grossly overpopulated and baking from the effects of global warming. I fear, however, that the ""shocking"" ending was telegraphed very early in the movie. Otherwise a workmanlike performance from Charlton Heston, but the main delight is to see Egward G. Robinson at his quirky, idiosyncratic best."
4,Soylent Green,After not seeing this for years it almost seems unreal. Its as Frightening and reel as ever.
3,Soylent Green is People,A moldy oldie. A little dated but it still provides viable entertainment. If you haven't seen it it's worth a look.
4,Soylent Green,Still very relevant especially given continued end of the world warnings of the current decade! A sad sad example of what happens with an uninformed/misinform populace and a small unethical elitist group who would subjugate the masses. This could be our world in the not so distant future. Take heed.
3,Edward G. Robinson uses his own imminent death to deliver a great role,"Soylent Green is a good scifi flick. What rates it abve a two is a scene with the excellent and underated actor, Edward G. Robinson. In a room where people in this society go when they are ready to die they are shown scenes of incredible beauty, scenes just for them. Scenes of the natual beauty of this planet long gone. What gives this moment particular poignency is that while it was being shot the film crew, more than a dozen were quietly crying off camera. They all knew that Robinson himself was also dieing. I believe he never survived to see the films release"
5,love it,love the movie and the price and also got it in time for Christmas and plan on ordering again thanks
2,More Details Would Be Nice,"I bought this DvD for my grandparents who remember seeing it when they were younger, and low and behold when I got the DvD nothing that I had read about the product said: ""LetterBox and Widerscreen"" so I returned the product without opening it. I did not want my grandparents watching a movie that was only going to be playing on 1/3 of their tv screen. Whoever made this format for movies should be fired."
1,"Boring, tedious, slow... Need I go on?","OK, I'll go on: For some reason this movie has a certain cult cache that gives it a hippness that it doesn't deserve. I sat through the entire 97 minutes because someone once told me it was a cool cult sci fi flick. What a waste of time. It just goes on and on with virtually no plot, no character development, lousy acting, [bad] music, unimaginative sets, and [bad] diaglogue. Otherwise, it wasn't too bad. If you value your time at all, you'll skip this one. If you want to see a cool ""sci-fi noir"" film, get Bladerunner (The Director's Cut), one of the best films ever made."
3,Soya bean,"I like it, but if you see this to date it won't impress you that much, it was good at 1973."
4,A hazy view of the future,"This film is very dated and also very fun to watch. I won't give away the ending, but the final line by Charlton Heston is quite over the top as far as acting goes. But that was always his style. Great movie for the 70's sci-fi fan."
3,A mediocre movie with a great punchline,"Can a bad joke have a great punchline? That's how I feel about Soylent Green. It's a bad movie about an overpopulated world, but the ending is shocking, memorable, and even inspirational. And I'm not necessarily talking about Soylent Green, the new wonderfood of the future. The most powerful scene in the entire movie is when old man Sol goes to die in a dignified but twisted version of euthanasia. If that scene doesn't make you love Life and Earth, then you may as well eat Soylent Green."
4,classic 70's views on the future,"This sci-fi says 1970's all over it. Its supposed to be around 2015 but the clothes, dialog, music, tv's, cars, etc all are from the 1970's era. If your looking for a movie to just sit down and have a good time with, then this is for you. Its great to see that the 1970's views are just held over till 2015. You will have lots of laughs watching this movie,,,,especially the scene with ""the scoops"". Soylent green is...........!"
3,soylent green,"I only meant to order 1 of these, not 2. This is the second time this has happened to me. I hesitate to respond to these review requests because I have never received any kind of feedback. But I am an unhappy customer."
3,wierd & appocolyptic sci-fi...,"""Futuristic"" for the '70s , Chuck Heston is a cop/investigator in a world apparently lost after world disaster . To be plain ,this ""PG"" movie deserves atleast PG13 rating for nudity , suggestive themes and violence. ""R"" might be more appropriate .The main theme , scattered throughout is , FOOD ; government supplied food ""soylent"" alluding to soy based products . Soylent red , blue and green . the REAL question is the source of that ""food"" . Some parts & scenes will smack of ""Logan's Run"" similarity ....Think of present day falling economy and RIOTs of 1960's and you'll have a general ""feel"" . Much is as movies were in the production time ; meandering , slower paced , slow develop , but isnt clear enough to spell out the main idea too soon either . piece by piece the puzzle will come together .All in All , for the sci-fi mainstream person , a nice bowl of popcorn , snuggle with your honey and enjoy ."
4,Timeless,"Soylent Green was way ahead of it's time in it's production. A little far-fetched in content, but, who knows . . . it could happen. You can't go wrong with Charlten Hesten and Edgar G. Robinson - - Great performances by both. Worth seeing in the 70's or in the New Millenium"
1,Horribly BAD-by any standard,The plot is one that can be thought provoking and that is interesting but it is sooooooo dated that it is hard to watch and so sexist I cannot even find a movie worse than this one. Just a dud.
1,Poor Quality Product,"This DVD reminded me of a VHS tape that needed tracking. It appeared to be copied from a VHS tape that nobody was actually watching at the time, therefore the skips and scrambled effects. This experience makes me wonder if Amazon and/or their suppliers get their products from the Copy Market in Shanghai."
5,See Big Chuckie Solve The Mystery Of The EVIL Soylent Green!!!,This is yet another highly overrated movie starring Charlton Heston . The year is 2022 and the Earth is overpopulated and food is in scarce supply. So the Goverment of the time finds a new and novel way to solve both of these problems. If you can't figure out the mystery in this movie within the first 30 minutes then I suggest youy stop applying for jobs as a Rocket Scientist. I mean I was 13 when I first saw this movie and I had it pegged in less time than that. I give this movie 5 stars because I like Edward G. Robinson.
1,Really Really bad,"This was terrible. Cheesy to the max. The suspense was lost in the cheese. The idea is not bad and could probably be remade into a decent movie, but this was crap.This movie is very slow at times, but the big reveal, the payoff of the movie was pushed through pretty fast. I feel like I just wasted an hour and a half. I do not know why some people feel this is a great movie, but I would say you'd be better off reading the plot somewhere.Read the plot, including the ""big secret"" of the movie.Imagine what a movie with that plot would be like.Whatever you came up with is likely 10x better that this movie.Stop there, do not watch it, you will be disappointed."
5,THE NEW OBAMA NATION ?,"If Obama, is re elected, this may no longer be science fiction, but science fact.I have watched this movie many times, for many years. I no longer can enjoy this like I have in the past. With a little imagination, I could see this happening to our great country. I pray it never does."
1,now I remember,"Hadn't seen this movie for decades. Hasn't been on TV anywhere so I bought it. Now I know why. Simple plot, little or no SPX and just plain boring all around.Oh well, they can't all be winners...."
2,"INTERESTING IDEA BUT, DATED AND BORING!","'Soylent Green' has one of the most famous ending lines in movie history(Soylent Green is people!), It's like ""Frankly Scarlet""... ""I don't give a damn!"" for kids of the 70's. I love the premise, but it's poorly executed and unfortunately it's also seriously dated(In home version of Asteroids video game given as a state of the art gift!)and it's just plain talky and boring. I watched this on an HD channel and it looked crisp, but the film is dark and gloomy, this is probably intentional. I'm not sure what this new DVD release looks like, but does it matter? If you like the movie you will probably buy it anyway. For the rest of us this one is to be forgotten."
3,Edward G's Swan Song!!,"It's sad because I loved Robinson's portrayal's as larger than life villans. His performance in this movie was prophetic. Charlton Heston was at the top of his game when he starred in this film. Unfortunately, the plot was slow and teedious. If you can endure it, you'll be quite intrigued by the vision of the future in this movie."
3,A seriously disturbing film,"Soylent Green is one of the most disturbing films I have ever seen and this film was made nearly thirty years ago and I'm only 20. The image that will always stick out in my mind is the haunting image of the ""Scoops"", riot trucks that are garbage trucks used to scoop up people whenever a riot breaks out over the Soylent Green supply. These trucks pile people in as if they were garbage killing them by crushing them and they're hauled off to be recycled as food. Soylent Green is disturbing in the fact that it can provoke thought and make people think about what could possibly happen if we choose to neglect our natural resources."
4,A Disturbing Depiction of the Future,"Released in 1973 and starring Charlton Heston, Brock Peters and EG Robinson, Soylent Green is a disturbing yet progressive story that leaves you thinking and questioning what you eat in the end! The story is set in the future - the year 2022. There are 40,000,000 people in New York City alone. Overpopulation caused environmental problems and a food shortage. Only the wealthiest people can afford luxuries such as soap, liquor, strawberries and meat. The government contracted with the Soylent Corporation to distribute rations everyone else. The rations are in the form of Soylent Red, Soylent Yellow and the new product Soylent Green (a green cracker-like product). In the course of the film, one of the of the board members of the Soylent Corporation is murdered, and Thorn (Heston) attempts to solve the murder mystery. In the midst, he discovers the true source of Soylent Green (hint: it wasn't soy and minerals!). Give this one a watch!"
3,"Interesting, in the context of current events","Given the date it was filmed, it was interesting to see their perspective on government controls to ensure the 'welfare' of citizens. Lacked the flair of contemporary hollywood technology, but it successfully makes a troubling statement about where we could be headed."
4,Terrifying in its Plausibility,"Charlton Heston plays a NYPD detective investigation the murder of a top-feeder in the corporate pyramid when he stumbles upon a secret that could get him killed.Not that life isn't cheap in the near future: suicide spas, crowd control with dump trucks; you get a chill watching it because aside from the dated clothing and fads it seems more than possible, especially in an already crowded city like New York.Edward G. Robinson, an icon of early gangster pictures, is Heston's roomate/mentor/researcher. I find his performance oddly touching, considering the hard cases he's played in the past.\The ending was damatic and shocking in the early 70s, but seems almost rational now. Sick, yes? But I wouldn't put it past 'em.Plus I'm fond of strawberries..."
4,I was a bit freaked out by the movie.,"I thought it was a ""powerful"" film. It brought about some interesting facts that should be thought about by everyone. Although the first half an hour was kind of dull, the rest of it will keep your attention. I would recommend this movie to all. In fact, it should be mandatory for schools to show!"
3,Soylent Green,Movie was recommended. It had an expected ending. Charleston Heston did a nice job in the movie.I have no regrets buying the movie
5,Soylent Green,"Soylent GreenWAY Before it's time, Goodness Forbid.Notice Still have hard line telephone and generators.Soylent GreenCharlton Heston, Edgar G."
3,son,I had told my son about this old movie and he did not believe me so I just went to Amazon and there it was. So now he believes his momma... thanks again.
3,A good yarn for the uninitiated,"I haven't read other Bova, picked this up at a used-book store. Cracking yarn, read it in 24 hours. The characters were well-developed compared to much earlier SF (Clarke's Rendezvous with Rama, for example). The plot was more about anthropology than hard SF but very good and full of unexpected events, and my loyalties swung back and forth among the nuanced characters.It struck me that many plotlines of Battlestar Galactica (2003 TV series) could not have been written without this book. It meanwhile borrows heavily from Rama when it comes to the habitat itself.The book was over too soon, and it's all about getting there; the story of mankind's experience with the ringed is not told! That's my only criticism; the book should be called Habitat, or Journey, but not Saturn. Three solid stars."
2,not Bova's best,"I really enjoyed Mars, as well as other books by Ben Bova. Unfortunately, Saturn is no Mars - despite its name it's not even in the same solar system.Saturn is bogged down by way too many characters. Secondary - rather tertiary - characters abound, showing up once or perhaps twice in the 400 pages. It also suffers from a lack of a clear protagonist. Eberly is the primary person, but he is certainly not someone the reader sympathises with. His fellow conspirators are worse - cardboard stereotypes. Holly is an interesting young/old woman (ambiguous age due to cryogenics) but her emotions yo-yo from one male to another, and it is hard to care in the end who she ends up with.Potentially climatic scenes such as the posse call are left flat, as the persuasion that Eberly so effortlessly used for hundreds and thousands of people inexplicably leaves him in a room of fifty.Very disappointing. I would suggest reading Mars a second time and pretending it has rings rather than reading Saturn."
1,Not a good read,"This book is possibly the worst so far of Bova's solar system novels and it was actually quite an effort for me to finish it. The story relates the voyage of a space colony out to Saturn and basically follows in minute, plodding and predictable detail the various power struggles amongst the colony elite as they seek to gain control. The premise of the story is pretty incredible to start with. Why would anyone send a space colony of 10,000 inhabitants out to a previously unexplored part of the solar system anyway?There isn't any excitement or wonder of exploration as in 2001 A Space Odyssey, for example. The characters are all the usual Bova two dimensional unbelievable types and even the science, which is occasionally a good feature of Bova's novels, is missing.I'm going to have to think long and hard about whether I want to buy any more books in this series."
1,A gift for pain,This book was so bad it was painful. One almost pitied the characters for the lack of of vision of their creator and the lack of life with which they were imbued.
1,Awful! Dreadful!,"Sorry to the fans of this author and genre, but this book is truly one of the worst I have ever read. Basically, the characters are extremely dry, weak, and/or naive beyond belief. Secondly, common with sci-fi stories, there's no spiritualality. OK, for this story, in the future, man dumps God and all religions and uses religion as a mere tool. But that always leaves a gaping hole. Something's always missing when any sort of spirituality is removed.Just a dull, political rambling."
4,I have really enjoyed this series,"Somehow I missed this book when it came out in MMPB in 2004. I recently saw it for sale, purchased it and now understand a little bit about Mr. Bova's grand tour of the solar system. _Saturn_ is a good solid read and fits firmly in the Grand Tour series and stand alone. Even though I thoroughly disagree with Mr. Bova's belief that the Earth is about to undergo extreme global warming, his semi frequent mentions of that did not bother me too much.As mentioned, this is a book about the Grand Tour of the Solar System. I have really enjoyed this series as I am hoping that we, humanity, are getting ready for a serious commercial conquest of space. The Grand Tour is all about a possible version of that conquest over the next 5o years or so. Quite enjoyable indeed.BTW, Mr. Bova dedicated the book to his wife Barbara and Dr. Jerry Pournelle. I enjoyed seeing that as I frequently read Jerry's books and website and have emailed with him a couple of times."
3,Another space opera scifi novel,This one is readable and all that but just not very interesting. No really great ideas either.
1,"Political novel, with little science fiction","I had high expectations for this book, but the more I read it became apparent it was nothing more than a space-based story of politics. Very little science fiction. A huge disappointment. So bad, it inspired me to write this review to warn others not to buy this book."
2,decent,"I got this for christmas, and it was awesome. for the first two days that is. First, the microphone didn't work, then the battery cover came off, then i filled it up with songs. sometimes the pause button doesnt work, and the buttons are to small. the white is way to shiny, and the screen is hard to read. the cord gets tangled in the lanyard, and it kills the batterys way to quick. definatly not recomennded."
5,I love this MP3 player!,This works great the battery lasts a long time. The only problem with it is that it says it can hold 500 songs but in reality it only holds about half of that -I think it's due to the length of the music files some may be larger than others-they should tell you that or make it completely compatable to hold 500 songs no matter what. Other than that I love it-it is so small and the sound quality is great! I would recommend this product it's great!
1,Don't bother....,Recently purchased this item through Amazon Marketplace and I am stuck with something that doesn't work...I own the 512 mb version of this model and have used it for over a year without an issue...only use it for running because it is so small and clips easily to my waistband...this model has given me nothing but trouble since I took it out of the box 4 days ago...customer support has been a joke...if they tell me to download the firmware one more time....did it and still not working...won't play past the third song without shutting down or simply just stops playing any music at all...won't shuffle..keeps going back to the first song...waste of money. Keep shopping for something else or just be sure that you can get your money back when it does not work properly!!!
1,Waste of time and energy!!,"I recently purchased one and the first one would not turn on even though we changed the batteries a few different times. We exchanged that one for another one thinking it was just faulty. The next one allowed us to turn it on and even put A song on it. When we went to put more songs on it the computer would not recognize it. We persisted, we tried uninstalling and reinstalling the programs and reseting the computer but it just wouldnt work. We also returned that one. Dont buy this product. the user's guide is worth nothing and costumer service doesnt make sense. Even though this product seems to be a great deal dont buy it. Go for something from a company you already trust."
2,Son vacas somos puercos,I love some of her other books and was pretty disappointed by this one. Try La Milagrosa or Cielos de la tierra for some better reading.
4,i have to believe that this product does help my knees. Have to get used to taking it but I have less pain when I do.,i have to believe that this product does help my knees. Have to get used to taking it but I have less pain when I do. I have tried other forms of Glucosamine and condroutin but this liquid form seems to help with the others didn't.
1,terrible!,"had purchased before,but this time the box was delevered by the post office(not ups)bottle was werapped in a plastic bag,leaking all over the floor. they would not work with me--out $25.00-they lost a good customer! looked like some stamped on the package-what a mess!"
4,Great for the beginner,"Quick Course in Microsoft Windows 98 is a very good book if one is a beginner and wants to learn the basics in ""10 easy lessons"". This book is a concise no-nonsense way to learn Windows 98. If one has even an elementary knowledge of Windows 98 the book is best used just as an easy to use feference for doing the evaryday tasks of Windows. The lessons are easy to follow and very non-threatening. There are good visuals and the text is large and easy to read. The language used in the book is directed to the novice. Any new terms are quickly defined. The reader is expected to know very little about the Windows environment. This ia a very good book for rthe adult who is just getting into computers. It will tell you everything you need to know in order to run Windows without any problems. The with a little more advanced knowlegde would be better served getting a higher level book."
5,a pop/rock masterpiece,"This album is simply awesome. First listen to, I Wanna Break Your Heart, and if that doesn't get your attention, well... nevermind."
1,"Ordered 3, still looking for parts for two of them","I ordered 3 of the 8 cubic foot dual wheel wheelbarrow and I'm short 2 sets of wheels D, 1 long brace L, 2 Braces K, 1 axle G, 1 true temper sign I, 2 brackets F, 1 wheelgard C, 2 tray braces H, 1 bag of hardware and a cotter pin.... so right now I have 1 wheelbarrow and a pile of useless parts. What a waste of money and where is the email address to contact the shipper, there isn't any. I buy predominately on Amazon but I'm on a very rural farm but next time I'll spend my time and gas money to drive an hour and go get wheelbarrows. I'm hoping Ace will send me these parts so I can remove this review.Ames True Temper 8 Cubic Foot Poly Tray Dual Wheel Contractor Wheelbarrow BP8"
1,plastic crap,"I should have known better!!!! cheap plastic crap that is poorly constructed at stress points. Used very little for ANY kind of heavy work. Plastic tub cracked at bolt heads almost immediately, not much later at base of tub near the deepest point. Can't get refund from dealer, nor can I even find a replacement tub. Trying to JB Weld and jerry rig some fix. At the price..... shouldn't have to go there.stay away!!!!"
1,JUNK - leaves and mulch only,"complete disappointment - three cracks in poly tub, broken wooden handle, axle attachment straps twisted and bent causing wheels to rub against tub. Jackson does state in their description that its great for leaves and mulch. This wheelbarrow should not be used for anything heavier then full loads of leaves or mulch. It might hold up with partial loads (1/4 to 1/2 tub) of dirt or stone? I used mine for 4 months. I just ordered a Sterling Wheelbarrow that is for commercial use, I should have went the commercial route in the first place for a few extra dollars. Ames True Temper and Jackson 8 cubic foot poly tray dual wheel are the same wheelbarrow"
4,The Little Unicorn,The Little Unicorn is a tough movie to find but a great addition to any home viewing collection. This movie is very fmaily friendly and would make a great family night movie for everyone of all ages to enjoy.
2,"Not bad for little kids, but it's very derivative","E.T. and Elliott ride across the moon... Oh, wait. This corny unicorn flick is just a rip-off of that children's classic. The ""E.T."" is a mythical one-horned horse named Spike, and ""Elliott"" is a little girl named Polly (Brittney Bomann). When Polly's mare foals Spike, she is desperate to shield him from covetous eyes but before long a nosy reporter finds out about the magical beast and it's a chase that goes into the very sky.Staci Layne Wilson"
3,Replacement Carafe Not Available,Coffee maker works well. Broke carafe and replacement not available from Toastmaster or any online search. My options now are to buy different model carafe with unique elevated mid portion of lid to allow coffee to drain at about the same cost as a replacement of the entire unit.
5,UPDATED- 10/17/10 - still Great coffee brewer - up to Toastmaster* brand quality standards,BUT not at all easy to clean - spigot/spout/ not removable - carafe lid not removable and when pouring one can get burned unless pot held perfectly over cup/or pitcher as for Iced Coffee.Otherwise it is def up to Toastmaer* Brand quality standards.Rec'd today - brewed a pot after inital cleaning per directions and very happy with the cone filter - as well as the ease of removing filter basket for cleaning as well as the streamlined look.Toastmaster TCM12PW 12-Cup CoffeemakerDidn't time but sure less than 10 min from filling to coffee mug.
5,My Favorite Suspense Title!,"The classic ghost story. Unlike the remake, which relied too much on special effects, this version enthralls the viewer into the action, characters, and plot (it actually has one unlike the remake!). I've seen it many, many times."
4,Chilling,"A chilling story in which we find sleep deprived people as part of an experiment during one night's stay at a rumored Haunted House. During that night they run into different scaries that take a heavy psychological toll on all who are involved. By the end of the movie we find almost all of the characters have gone, to a point, mad."
5,Classic creepy ghost story,"This is one of my absolute favorite ghost stories. I saw it for the first time a few months ago and was amazed at how creepy and horrifying it is. Much, much better than the 1999 remake! It just captures the whole creepy atmosphere and keeps you on edge."
5,Far Superior To The Remake,"Fans of Shirley Jackson will delight in this screen adaptation of The Haunting of Hill House. Faithful to the original novel and not bogged down in excessive specail effects, this movie haunts you and keeps your attention. The character of Nell may be irritating at times, but her personality is consistent with Jackson's book. The characters and situations seem much more probable than the more grisley and explicit 90's film adaptation. If you like this one you should check out the Legend of Hell House."
3,Very poor video transfer....,"This is one of my all-time favorite 3 movies in this genre and I was greatly disappointed in the DVD release. I purchased this when it came out in August 2003 and I was appalled at the horrible quality of video: all the dark scenes (the opening scene of the house is a great example) are shimmering (a good word that another reviewer wrote) and flickering, especially the ""infrared"" filmed scenes. I figured I had gotten a bad copy and I was just about to purchase a new one since 9 months have gone by (I thought the bad batch would all be purchased by now) when I read another review just written last month which has the same complaint. I was also disappointed with the audio commentary of Julie Harris and Claire Bloom. They're contribution is so short I feel like they were snippets of old interviews and not made specifically for this release (unlike the bulk of the commentary). I guess quality doesn't matter to this company."
5,This Movie will keep you up nights !,"This has been my favorite movie since I was a kid,Now whenever I want a good scare I turn out the lights and watch The Haunting. So if you want to know what goes bump in the night, this movie is a must see!"
3,A poor transfer. What a shame.,"Without a doubt my favorite ghost story on film. I'd waited years for this film to be released on DVD only to discover upon receipt of the DVD the black and white photography is ruined by a shoddy transfer. The black tones, so important to the feel of this film, shimmer and move in a way that distracts from the amazing photography and potent story. It took them so long to release this movie on DVD I can't imagine they will ever re-version this film with a better tranfer. Whoever approved this transfer should get their eyes examined. Let's hope when/if they ever release Jack Clayton's version of ""The Innocents"" on DVD they don't make the same mistake."
2,Not very haunting,"This movie is hardly scary, just some banging and slamming doors. To witness REAL horror check out The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween, The Shining, The Exorcist III, The Amityville Horror 1&2, and Suspiria. I have yet to see The Blair Witch Project."
2,Some suspense and weird but not scary,There was some suspense and quirkiness but it wasn't very scary. I have a feeling the person responsible for the music in this movie went on to a short career or learned fast but only after this movie.
2,"OK, I guess, but NOT scary","Maybe I'm jaded and ruined by modern cinema, but to have a neurotic, child-like woman run around in a house at night, dressed in kid's nightgown while hearing ""mysterious"" pounding on the walls is NOT scary. It was well made, though, and somewhat interesting, mainly because of its lack of a massive special effects budget. The Doctor made me think of the crazy British guy in Rocky Horror Picture Show (which was made more than 10 years later, I know), and Ms Bloom was gorgeous.The main character's conversation with the guy that opens the gate when she first arrives to the mansion was almost laughable and might just as easily have been shot in the 40's."
5,Not to be missed,I saw this movie when it first came out and let me tell you that if I hadn't been a teenage male I would have run shrieking in fright from the theater but males don't do that.It's all been said in the previous hundreds of reviews but this movie remains as frightening to me on DVD as the first time I saw it. Forget your blood and guts movies. No blood and guts here but a memorable experience that will leave you with nightmares for years.
4,Pretty Good,"This is, of course, a classic. It has a very nice atmosphere as well as a spooky one. I'm not going to say this is scary but more spooky than anything. The acting is good along with a good cast. I'm more of the type that likes to be scared watching a horror movie. This one didn't really scare me at all but I still think it deserves at least four stars. All and all, not a bad movie."
5,One of the Best Hauntings Ever,I still remember the first time I saw this in the theatre. It was one of the scariest I'd ever seen and is still one of the best IMO. The remake can't hold a candle to this one.
2,I Just Didn't Find This Film Interesting,"Perhaps I am a sad product of the modern, Hollywood, special-effects horror movie. I watched this movie with an open mind, hoping to be chilled and intrigued. Instead, I found the movie long and tedious. The acting was, in my opinion, overdone (think about how Shirley Temple overacted her roles in the old black and white movies). The plot was interesting but predictable. The set was beautiful, the soundtrack was great... other than that, there wasn't much to keep me interested. This movie is, however, better than the ridiculous, color remake. For a good B&W haunted house movie, watch ""House on Haunted Hill"" with Vincent Price."
2,"Ok, I was prepaired to take this movie for what it was...","...(out of age, I mean), but as I'm not the only one here to've noticed; This movie is extremely overrated. This being said I refuse to waste my time making a big point out of this, it's just that the reviewers here who've stated that a movie is not a good movie nor a classic just because it is old, well, of course you are right, and I totally agree. And also let me add that I actually feel bad now for having hated the modern version of this so-called classic also named ""The Haunting"" from 99 or so -it turns out that compared to the original based on the famous book it's not that horrible after all -not that I am a fan of it, but at least it has a story going somewhere. And serves some entertaining moments at a minimum. Now I don't see the big point in making such a movie as this original is, actually most because I could not believe it really ended the way it did -or did I miss something? Was that really all?"
3,it's all in the audio...,"first and formost, this is the best haunted house story - period.if you have seen this film, you know that audio plays a large part in the tention of this wonderful film from the man who made the earth stand still - robert wise.i wish that the dvd was in suround at least. god, when eleanor and theo are in eleanor's room and that... SOUND envelopes them, you see from their reactions that it is all around! that would have been the best upgrade. i didn't see a terrible ""shimmering"" that one of the other reviewers saw, but i only had a well loved 2nd gen copy of a w/s vhs so to me the video was a step up. you'd think for it's 40th anniversary, the film would have gotten the criterion treatment. hey, that's not a bad idea, criterion. get a hold of this gem and do it justice!!"
3,no scare no suspense,"I saw this movie assuming it was going to be a lot better than the disastrous remake with Catherine Zeta Jones and Liam Neeson. Well, it was a lot better and had some pretty eerie moments. For the most part however, this movie is pretty blah. Julie Harris and Claire Bloom do pretty decent jobs in their roles. I really like the cameo from Moneypenny of the James Bond films. She factors into the only part of the movie that turned out to be the least bit scary and that is near the end at the spiral staircase scene. Other than that, there's much better movies to see before you see this one. Why not try Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" or even ""The Changeling"". You won't be disappointed with those. (orig. post: 10/24/05)"
2,Definitely an old movie,Unless you like this type of movie this will be very hard to watch. Movie was boring and very different than the book
1,Need amplifier to hear audio,"Picture is spectacular, but the audio is faint. It would have been nice if the company that produced the DVD would have digitally mastered the sound as it did for the video. I have the volume maxed on my television and I can barely here the audio. A special audio amplifier is needed to amplify the volume loud enough to comfortably here. This DVD is such a disappointment because this is one of the greatest horror movies ever made."
2,BORE,"Compared to current thrillers, this is a bore. My grand parents may like it, not I though. I guess I am just spoiled with great CG now."
4,Lots of suspense without the gore,Very good movie.It had all the suspense you could handle without all of the gore and blood.The actors were very convincing and performed their roles well.Good movie to watch on a stormy night.
5,A true classic,"If you want a quick chill up your spine, open Shirley Jackson's ""The Haunting"" to Page One and read a few graphs until ""...whatever walked in Hill House, walked alone."" An acclaimed novelist turned to horror and created a haunted house that freaked its inhabitants with their worst fears: Their own disappointing selves. When Hollywood directors covered Frankenstein and Dracula they were working from brilliant novels, and tried to honor their ideas on film. So it was with ""The Haunting."" Go ahead, finish the book. Then slip in this DVD and see a great novel brought to life on film. Absolutely beautiful. The narration of the aforementioned opening is worth the price of admission."
5,scared of the dark?,"Well I don't normally write film reviews but I've never been so enthusiastic about a film - Tha Haunting will scare the hell out of you.Personally sick of special effects and big name actors I have spent a lot of time trawling through old horror movies, some poor some good but I never realised how effective old black and white horror could be till I discovered this film. The acting is a bit stale, especially at the beginning with very unconvincing dialogue, but once the atmosphere kicks in you discover what this film is really about. With no special effects all the talent lies in the fantastic camera work combined with intelligent use of sound. The Haunting involves you like few other horror films because it relies on your own imagination.Pretty special effects are all nice eyecandy but thats the point - horror ain't supposed to be pretty.Special effects make you go ""wow"" not ""aarrgghh! """
5,"Horror ""done right""","This movie is a great example of what truly frightens us: The Unknown! Forget the stupid slasher, blood-drenched excuses for fright that saturate the movie market. The special effects in those movies are so obvious as to be laughable.What sets this original version of The Haunting apart is its ability to bring us close to the types of situations we all might really confront, things that ""go bump in the night,"" and for which we never seem to have a good explanation. Even adults are genuinely frightened by the possibilities that are presented in this film."
5,"Forget the remake, watch the original!","If you appreciate a really dark, really intense psycholocially thrilling movie, you gotta see ""The Haunting"". My words only cheapen the experience. It has so many layers, so many fears and feelings, I just hope you get a chance to see it. I must admit I've seen it a number of times and always, always find it fresh and fascinating. I plan to buy this on DVD very soon. A solid five stars!"
5,Stands the test of time,"I saw this movie on TV one night as a child with my brothers and just saw it again on video; it's just plain eerie! Very well done; Julie Harris is excellent. Most memorable scenes are the ""breathing"" door and the face in the wall. It scared me so much as a child that I never forgot it! Beautiful B&W cinematography and lots of atmosphere. Great haunted house movie without the gratuitous gore. Be sure to watch it in a darkened room!"
1,Outdated,"Although I'm no fan of the boring Jan De Bont remake, the original is much too dated to scare anyone above the age of 8. The Others and The Sixth Sense are much better and much scarier."
1,Days long ago,"I have a vivid recollection of watching this movie as a child and being quite put on edge. In the group is was with, I was the one scared then, but did not have nightmares while those not scared at the time had nightmares.Wow, have I changed. I found this to be a movie about catty women and less-than-reputable men. This is not a scary movie, it is a psychological drama set in a scary house. The cinematography of the house is great. The visuals set the stage for some scary stuff. Unfortunately all that happens is some chilling pounding in the night, ""breathing"" doors, and an unexpected vissage.I would like to get myself in the frame of mind I had in those days long ago and see this movie and get scared again. I am afraid, however, that this movie will only frighten the very young."
4,A good movie lost in cropped version.,"I have this video, and every time I watch it, I want to see beyond the square screen, but nothing is there. It is a must for widescreen. A California cable channel showed this film in widescreen for a Halloween special a few years ago. I only saw parts of this version but what I saw made it seem alltogether different. The lighting is so well done, it allows the viewer to use their own fears to create faces in the shadows. This is my favorite ghost story film other than ""What Lies Beneath"". Oh, one more thing, unlike the resent cool funhouse remake, the 1963 version is most like Shirley Jackson's novel ""The Haunting of Hillhouse"". I can't wait for the widescreen version on DVD!"
4,Same Release As The 2003 Version,"Rather than tell you how great this movie is (and it is great), I'm just going to chime in for those who are wondering what the difference is between the August 5, 2003 release and the November 9, 2010 release is. Short answer is none.The 2003 release aspect ratio is shown as 2:35:1, whilst the 2010 release aspect ratio is shown as 2:40:1. Although it sounds different, the 2:35 aspect ratio is actually 2:39, as is 2:40. So they are the same. It's possible, of course, that the quality of the 2003 disk is better. Companies are always trying to cut corners. But the two releases are basically the same.The mansion used in the movie is actually a hotel called Ettington Park, in Stratford Upon Avon, in the U.K. My wife and I stayed there for one night years ago and had a great time. You can find pictures on YouTube and the Internet."
4,Good film.,"I watched both films, ""The Innocents"" and this one when I was eleven year old. I still think ""The innocents"" is superior because the author Henry James is pretty superior than Shirley, but this film is truly scary because Shirley copied the idea of Henry James that fear is inside our minds, when you use this statement you can create such an environment where the majority of things is in our imagination and increase a lot with no limit depending on how sensible you are to these facts. Buy this film ""The Innocents is superior"", but this is better than any scary film based in blood and gory."
3,Needs enhancement!,"I had been looking for this title to be available on disk or VHS for some time. The Haunting has always been one of my favorite movies and I wanted to share it with friends and family.I wish it had been given a better treatment, however. The sound quality is very poor and the picture appears to have been copied direct from an old print with no enhancement whatsoever. The movie is five star. This treatment quality wise is two!"
5,"Scariest Movie ever, even better on DVD","One of my favorite movies. Even better on DVD. Sound is just OK, but heck, that is just the way it was.Since I know the movie so well, I absolutely loved the commentary track and all the insights it offered. Richard Johnson is a hoot when he discusses the movie.My 10 year old watched the movie with me. He was pretty scared by the end. He had to sleep with me that night. But he loved it.I cannot for the life of me figure out why more movies are not made these days in this style, without all the blood and gore. One of the other reviewers said it best. Watching the original made the remake look even more terrible than it was.Buy this DVD, it is rated G, so you can watch it with your kids, but they will be scared. Watch also for the lesbian undercurrent. It is there, as evidenced by Bob Wise's commmentary."
3,Good picture/bad sound,"This is a great classic. So, why do they give the sound such shabby treatment. I feel cheated. Maybe if you have a good television with a small speaker this is acceptable sound. make sure your home theater system has tone controls and that the dynamic range is not high. Most black and white 50's films sound great on my system. This film did not! I would give it five stars otherwise."
5,The Best Horror Flick,The way to describe this movie is to say that you never see what you think you do. It is all in your head. The wonderful power of suggestion. Since I was 12 to this day 30 years later; this one is the one I remember the most for fright.
5,Definitely one of the all-time great modern horror films,"Even when ""The Haunting"" is given one of its rare TV showings, I still can't watch alone, and I'm spooked to the point that I can't sleep that night. Psychologically, the images stay with you, and certainly after all these years it remains one of the strongest tales of ghosts and possessed houses that has ever been filmed. It shows how poor today's so-called horror films are in comparison. I dare you to watch in the dark!"
5,Scary,This is one of the scariest movies I have watched. Take the time and watch this movie. I watch it every year
5,The Haunting: Classic Psychological Thriller,"It's what you DON'T see that frightens. No monsters, no demons...except in your own head. This classic still has the power to frighten me, first as a ten-year old--what's making that door bend and bow--to a more mature adult: why is this ghostly energy so focused? The more I watch this, the more I see in it. Shirley Jackson's novel (the movie is based on it) is rich on many levels. This goes beyond a good Halloween scare...far beyond."
4,Classic,"This film is a classic that is great for its time and still holding up today. It's absolutely worth seeing, not a bad purchase, but be forwarned- I'm as big a fan of atmospheric horror as anyone, but this film is not the chiller so many other reviews/lists claim it is. There are a couple tense moments, but they are not comparible to many other films like The Thing, The Exorcist, The Omen (original), Poltergeist- just to name a few well known ones .If you like chillers, I have a recommendation not many people have seen. There is a relatively new film called Sublime, which is a little abstract, but uncomfortable and it keeps you guessing. Nothing but atmosphere and wonder."
2,Pretty Dull,"Before the remake of this hit the theaters I rented this version and watched it with my wife and son, who kept asking ""When is something going to happen?"" I must admit I felt the same. Lots of dull conversation and banter and really only one good scary scene in the whole film. One tepid manufactured scare later on turns out to be nothing at all. I guess it seemed better than it was back in 63, when I first saw it, because I was comparing it to the B monster movies of the time which were really awful. At least this was a serious film with a good performance by Julie Harris. But honestly, for me this was boring."
2,"Too bad,this just didn't do it for me.","When i was young this scared the hell out of me not now,not much in the thrills and chills department either.Except for the loud banging,wavy door,Grace times two appearances,and an unsafe staircase all those were good.And Elinor what a wuss a real mental case would i keep this movie? Nope."
3,Decent chair,"This chair holds up well and works fine for a guest chair in my reception area; however, next time I would get leather so that the surface can be cleaned."
2,A little disappointing,"I really like Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses, but the versions on this CD I don't find much different from the original. Paint It Black and Fortunate Son are disappointing because although the songs are very good, U2's sound is so different from that of the Rolling Stones and CCR that it doesn't work very well. I always say that 99 times out of 100 the original is better than any remake, and these two songs prove my point."
1,How can you like this CD???,"Seriously - they release a single of the only bad song on the album and then ad on a couple of AWFUL covers. Please, do not tell me this is a ""great single"". To say that ""Paint it Black"" or ""Fortunate Son"" are even close to as good as the originals only shows your lack of music knowledge. Those were two truly classic songs, these versions are the WORST!!! A long time ago U2 decided to write all their own material because they couldn't play covers. They still can't. Look at some of the other great ""B-sides"" they have come out with - ""Slow Dancing"", ""Walk to the Water"", ""Sweetest Thing"", ""Salome"", etc. those are great tunes, these do not compare. Go buy some Joshua Tree singles if you want great ""B-sides""..."
3,A loss of emotion...,"'Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses' is and always will be one of my favorite tracks on the Auchtung Baby album. It's very honest, and offset from what the band usually would sound like. With the ambience given off by the edge's guitar, the song builds and builds... until releasing at the emotional peak, as Bono cries the words ""...don't you look back!""However, in this single version (The Temple Bar Edit), that emotion is lost. There is no real peak to the song... the song is just lost in a wave of acoustic guitar and lighter drums. The original mood the album version had given off, is hopelessly lost - no more twisted pain, or agonizing guitar riffs, to make this song complete. I can't stand either of the single versions.'Paint It Black': Great cover... rocking just as much now, as when the Stones played it.'Fortunate Son': A soulful rendition of John Fogerty's song."
3,New versions different from the original,"The two versions of ""Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses"" that appear here (the ""Temple Bar"" mixes), one a long version and the other a short version, are far more acoustic and straight-forward renditions of the song which appears on 'Achtung Baby.' I feel that these are superior to the original version, which seemed a bit over-produced (even for 'Achtung Baby'), and I would not be suprised if the Temple Bar mix appeared on a future compilation (""U2-The Best of 1991-2000""?). The cover tunes, ""Paint It Black"" and ""Fortunate Son"", are somewhat forgettable."
5,Work of art,"Ripping guitars, thumping bass and Bono's full range. Classic U2 at its best. And the B-side tracks are amazing. Paint it Black inspired me to go out and buy some Stones albums but like so many Dylan and others, Bono's version has something extra!"
4,Pet Music,"While pleasant, relaxing and enjoyable, this CD did not help my pet's separation anxiety. ""Through a Dog's Ears"" was more effective. We play this CD as it is relaxing but don't depend on it for separation anxiety issues"
1,Non-fiction,"As observed by another reviewer, the authors make up a lot of stuff such as ""on opening a letter from Chandler alone in his study, Newcomb shifted his weight in his seat to find a comfortable spot"".Were the authors there to witness Newcomb shift his weight? I don't think so.This type of nonsense makes everything else in the book seem less credible. When else did they make stuff up? This is the stule of elementary school biographys - not serious scholarly works.As in their dreadful book ""Latitude"", there is a heavy dose of pro-American propaganda in this book which also makes its accuracy doubtful.No question that Simon Newcomb was a gifted man, but he deserves better than this fictional novel."
1,Not Old Time Gold Hits Original Recordings!,"These songs are cover versions sung by an unknown singer: German Mangandi, not original recordings. There is a big difference between Mangandi and Los Brincos (Los Mitos, Los Angeles or Los Iracundos).It is a pity, songs like ""Si te acuerdas de mi"", ""Momentos"", ""Lo que yo quiero"" etc, are really beautiful. The cover of this CD is a trick, I bought it, played it and threw it away."
1,Beautifully Done!,I bought this Cd and I have heard the old songs but German Mangandi add a new sence of style to all these songs making them original and up with the times. His music is well known in central america and he is a great musician that has worked very hard to achieve the kind of success he deserves. The person who has never hear of this singer is because he is unfamiliar with the true roots of Central america and El Salvador. I highly recommend this CD to enjoy it for what it is and the new sence of style that you hear in everysong.Different that is what makes a great artist!!!!
3,Very Good For Now,Bought one of these.. the bulb didn;'t work on one side.I requested a bulb and they refused saying they would send me a new unit which they did and we put the new one up and itsworking like most people said.It went up fine ..used plant hangers and some beautiful decorative hooks.. looks like a show piece.. and puts out enough light for now but later i might get astronger bulb.. I give it a three because of the fact it came in with one side of the bulb not working and had to get another but they did replace very quickly and have to give them a five star on communicating and at this point the light works well.. so.. guess we will see..
1,"Where's the ""system:?","I ordered the Hydrofarm FLC125D Florescent Grow Light System for an indoor terrarium. What I got...was a 125 Watt light bulb. That's it. No system. No hood. No place to even plug in my light bulb. Just a light bulb. From the product details I was expectingProduct FeaturesGarden indoors year-roundGet an early start on those tomatoes next springGrow flowers, herbs and much moreIncludes a 125 watt fluorescent bulb that will serve a 3' x 3' growing areaEasy to install: just hang it up and plug it inAlthough it says includes a light bulb, I was expecting more. And as for hang it up and plug it in, Again, I just have a light bulb. Nothing to hang and no where to plug. I have contacted the seller. Hopefully they will respond, but this is not what I expected."
4,A cute little book.,"I liked this book.OK, so it's not in depth study of the craft. But it's fun to read, it has a beautiful layout, it is filled with very lovely pictures and the spells are easier than those in the first book.The spells that contains are elemental spell, zodiac sign spells and kitchen spells. Especially this last section is great! The ingredients used are every day materials and common herbs, and so far they seem to work.Furthermore, it would make a great present for your pagan friend."
1,"Yes, it's good magick.... BUT",There are better books out there than this one. If I were you I would research first and look for other spell books. It was not what I was looking for.
