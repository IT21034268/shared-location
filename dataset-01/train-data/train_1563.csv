4,A surprise package,"I caught up with this album after seeing the video for the track ""Wavelength's Phase."" Interestingly enough the single, which is a more conventional rock ""builder,"" tells you little about what the rest of the album is like. It's actually full of surprises. Gota Cola are an eclectic bunch whose music runs from rock, through light dub to ambient. It's the kind of thing that could end up as a formless mess, but it hangs together surprisingly well. Tylea's vocals range from dreamy to powerful, and her guitar work is interesting. Lexie and Skritch make a versatile rhythm section. Production is by the ever-present (with Brisbane bands) Magoo. As with most albums there are a couple of fillers that could have been left out - Sunshine and Green Song, but mostly the album is strong, listenable and fun. A surprise package of real value."
1,Class action lawsuit vs HP re this PC,"Its NVIDIA GeForce Go 7600 has been said in the trade press to fail many months after purchase, often after warranty expires. For multiple links to the story, see hplies.com/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=130 and for Nvidia's $196 megabuck charge against revenue to cover replacements and lawsuits, see www.nvidia.com/object/io_1218573794316.html - this seems to be a non-trivial problem."
1,Blackberry PEARL case: scam,"sorry but this product was not what I had asked for. There was not even a hole cut out of the plastic for the track ball of my phone (as indicated in the picture) it could not even fit onto my BLACKBERRY PEARL 8100.. sorry but this is clearly false advertisementp.s. when I called to complain, they told me that all phones from this seller are the same, no hole for your track ball"
5,Thoroughly enjoyed every song on the CD.,"Seeing her perform live is what made me go out and buy the CD. She is a true professional and it shows in the music on this CD. There are no throwaway tracks on this CD. You will want to listen to it from beginning to end, over and over. I'm looking forward to hearing from her again, soon."
5,Beautiful work!,Great book for anyone wanting to know about horses especially those who don't know much about them. Beautiful artwork throughout the entire book-my favorite is the child kissing the nose. A book sensitive to one of the most beautiful animals and perfect for horse lovers of all ages. Makes a great gift-I've bought copies for my nieces who are just beginning to ride horses. Kudos to the author and artist!
2,entertaining but a little light on the facts,"This is a small, children's type book, devoting one page to each question about why horses do a great many different things. This is interesting for a light read, and I learned a few things domestic horse behavior.But most topics were glossed over and not answered with any depth, and the book was sprinkled with misnomers and subjective answers. For instance, the author says that a horse works better with a trainer because owners are afraid of their horses, and that many people will tell you to flip a rearing horse over--never heard of that! There are also questions such as why horses hate riding on trailers, and hate getting on trailers. Most horses, of course, don't have problems with horse trailers. These sorts of projections made me question the validity of the book."
4,Nice Book,"Bought this book for my 11 year old daughter who has recently begun horse back riding lessons. It is not a children's book nor is it a ""science"" book just full of facts. Somewhere in between it is pleasing to read and has beautiful illustrations. There is quite a bit of curious information packed in this small book."
4,"Excellent book for Clinical Approach, good for basic facts","This book is divided into 2 parts: Part 1 deals with The Clinical Approach, and Part 2 deals with the Essential Background Information.The Clinical Approach is the best part and includes 10 chapters (CNS, Eyes, Limbs, Head & Neck, Abdomen, Respiratory system, CVS, Hematology, Diabetes, and Skin). It focuses on the physical examination, and on the symptomatology.The second part contains a summary of basic clinical facts about the diseases which you can read in any standard textbook. In addition, there're many important subjects which are not covered properly in this section (e.g. dermatology).This book is not intended to be a complete textbook, and I think it should be supplemented by further reading. The margins of the pages are large so that you can add your additional notes. It contains few diagrams (no photographic pictures) and many tables."
3,Cheezies,"Was dissapointed with them. Being a Cheetos fan, I thought these would be a treat. First couple tasted pretty good but all-in-all, I'll stay with good ole Cheetos."
1,Worst Cheese Puffs I've Ever Tasted,This are hard and taste horrible - almost stale fresh out of the package. They should be ashamed to compare these to Cheetos. I ate 2 of these and throw the rest of the bag away!
1,"So salty, it's gross","Used to be addicted to Cheezies as a kid. Couldn't get enough of 'em. Had some as a snack recently, though, and almost gagged they were so salty. Ruined 'em for me for good."
5,Good Advice,When this book was written I was a young woman just starting out into the big bad male influenced world and was not used to standing up for myself. This book helped me put things into perspective and bolster my personal worth. It gave me the tools needed to get through some tough times. I recently purchased a copy to give to a friend who was suffering from self-confidence issues as a tool to help her move past them and to become more successful in her career.
2,"For this price, a decent zipper would be nice","I have owned this jacket for two winters, now. The zipper has always been difficult to get started and so I usually ignore it and just close the hook-and-loop fasteners unless it is windy out. Yet despite this limited use, the zipper has now started to come open below the raised pull tab, just as most cheap plastic zippers do eventually. (No, it is not because it fits too tightly. It is actually quite loose on me.) For this price, I expected a decent, heavy-duty zipper. Perhaps they could afford that if they left off all their embroidered company logos.... Also, the top of the zipper comes to the top of the collar, and when closed pokes into the bottom of my chin, which is very annoying.In addition, you must be very careful not to brush against anything sharp, such as broken branches or barbed wire, as the outer material tears VERY easily.I gave it two stars instead of one because it is warm, and the sleeves are actually long enough for my long arms."
4,Good book for Everyone who wants to source their Genius!,"Four steps for TRANSFORMING your life.Four steps that will bring you into NLP,photoreading and mindmapping.Learn how to tap your personal genius within.Learn how to slowdown and learn something new easily and effortlessly now. You WILLLearn about paraliminal tapes andhow to learn in a whole new way...You WILL Tap into your natural brilliance easilyand effortlessly, now.Another great book besides his classicbook, Photoreading.One may imagining owning this book now or not? nowww.. You WILLLearn how to tap once more into yournatural brilliance.Witness it...the miracle of BEING GENIUS!"
3,Best of a weak crop,"This book is better than most of the weak efforts in the field. It's written by a lawyer, and it does, helpfully, expose a lot of examples of schemes that WON'T work. But the reviewer from Peru has it right: none of these books seems to have really detailed descriptions of tax saving/asset protection schemes that might actually pass muster with the IRS/courts, so the whole thing comes off like an ad to bait you into buying the inside info from the author directly. All said, though, this book is a good deal better than any of its competitors."
4,Definitely a keeper!!,"This book should definitely be on the bookshelf of anyone seeking to invest offshore. The author provides excellent insights into the hows and why's of offshore investing. Although the organization of the book was sometimes hard to follow, and did assume some technical knowledge of trust concepts, overall it was a good book and worth the money."
4,A Good Start to Looking Offshore,"This book covers most of your questions and describes the basics for banking and corporations established outside the US. It tries to give you the pros and cons of each type of company and a list of places to look into. While it may not be the only book you'll ever need, it does a nice job of detailing what you'll need and how to go about the process of offshore management of finances and protecting your assets. It would have gotten 5 stars if it had been more recent. Still, its' quite worthwhile compared to what else is out there."
4,Nice cookbook,"I collect cookbooks. I like this book because the recipes are original and the ingredients aren't too esoteric. I don't like the coffee table size, it's too hard to browse through. I recommend if you are an experienced cook and always searching for new, interesting recipes."
4,Bruchetta ?,"Tra Vigne is one of my all-time favorite restaurants, and Michael's Bruchetta is the best! I have unsuccessfully tried to guess at a recipe, so I was thrilled to see his cookbook on the shelves, but very disappointed that, while there is a recepie for Bruchetta, it is NOT the one he serves at Tra Vigne. That one does not look at all like traditioal toasts with toppings, but, rather a bread/vegetable pudding/stuffing effect. Would love to have that recipe!"
4,He Can Write AND Cook,"This is a wonderful culinary book. It's more than a cookbook, as it focuses on various vegetables, etc. of the season, then uses those featured ingredients in several great recipes. If you've ever eaten at Tra Vigne in the Napa Valley town of St. Helena, you can even picture in your mind Michael in the kitchen, and almost taste the restaurant's just-pressed olive oil. If you know anyone who likes to read culinary books (like my mom, who literally reads cookbooks cover to cover, then goes back to earmark certain recipes), you should give them this book for the holidays. It is a beautiful, coffee table-quality, glossy work."
5,A work of unusual merit,Even a convinced hater of Gary Numan will come away from this recording with a new appreciation of his talents.
1,"I could have taken better video of my neice dancing, and shes 6!",This is a very poor video to teach any type of dancing skills. Most definately looks like someone walked around the streets with a comcorder when they got bored and called themselves making a decent video. if you want to learn to dance this is not going to teach you anything at all!
2,Only the barbell is stainless steel,"I loved this design and was looking for a cross that didn't dangle. But after about two weeks of showering, the cross began to change colors (because of the cheap metal) and the center stone fell out, which is not prong set. Overall it was very disappointing. Nice design but poor overall quality."
1,You get what you pay for...,"Perhaps I received a defective item, but the inside of the female portion of this adapter appears to be warped, so that when a 2.5mm plug is inserted, it cannot go in straight. Useless to return because the shipping cost alone is several times more than the price of the item. Order this at your own risk."
4,a good deal,"when I saw the price on these I immediately ordered a pair, but failed to read the details well enough. it didn't help that I ordered from my phone. nonetheless, the parts arrived fairly quickly, considering they came from China, and were in good condition."
1,Shorts out,This doesn't make a clean connection. I'm not sure if any brand of these devices would work as this is the only one that I've tried.
3,Didn't work for my purpose,I wanted an adapter for regular headphone use on a phone just to hear music - don't buy it for that because it won't work.
2,reception problems,I bought several of these to use a wired headset with my cell. I've had reception problems with this adapter.
1,Adapter,Well it did arrive on time. But it doesn't work at all and the post office charged me another $1.50 because they said there was not enough postage on it.
1,the one I got was horrible,"I got this for a set of old 2.5mm headphones with a mic to use with an Ipod touch. the headphones and mic work fine without the adapter. when I plugged them into the adapter and only the left earplug worked, no right earplug, no mic. Do not buy from uxcell."
1,It works but its not pretty,"It works, but it's quite large, and protrudes quite far from the side of my MP3 player. In hindsight I would have bought one with an ""L"" shape, not this one."
2,Didnt work with my phone,"I have a LG Rumor 2 and this adapter did not product any sound to my 3.5mm head phones.Although, it might be just my phone which is why I gave it 2 stars."
1,doesn't fit,Was not what I needed as the picture is some what misleading. It looks to be small and that the 2.5 mm fits on theend. When it actually fits down inside and can not be used with an elbow shaped 2.5mm male plug.
2,Works but will fall apart easily.,This product was very inexpensive and it did work but one fell apart the 2nd time I used it. The second one has lasted a month but stops working if you move it around. I bought it to test something out so it worked for me but buy something else if you need/want it to last.
2,didn't work for me,"tried to use to go from 2.5 headset to 3.5 phone jack, didn't work, maybe due to not fitting all the way in since barrel on male end is fat"
4,Like it,It's just what i need to connect my cell phone to my home stereo to play my music. Works well.
1,Doesn't work for IPhone 4,The item arrived as promised.I have an IPhone 4 and the 3.5 mm male plug will not fit in the female jack of the phone.It doesn't work for the IPhone 4.
1,This is a piece of junk,"Doesn't matter how cheap it is. Don't waste your money even if it's a penny! This is a piece of junk. First of all, when you plug in 2.5mm into this, it wobbles, and 3.5mm end doesn't exactly plug into the phone jack well either."
2,poor quality,"The plastic covering on the adapter is poorly cast and malformed. It seems to work o.K., but is large and prevents the phone from fitting in the holster."
2,wrong part,"Needed a 3.5mm to 2.5mm plug adaptor, guess we ordered the wrong one. Good thing is that the price made it OK."
1,Don't buy this crap,"I bought this small item paying $3.50 when I had the same available from other sellers at .99 cents just because it is from a local seller in US and it would arrive soon and I can use it. But waht I got was a piece of junk. I connected my 2.5mm earphones into this adapter and all I can hear is all noise and barely any music. There was so much distortion, noise and disturbance. I tried connecting to different phones and mp3 players and it did not work on any one of them. I hate to buy anything like this in future. Please dont buy anything from this seller. I did not call the seller as I did want to waste my time in returning the item and waiting again to get a new one."
1,This product is listed incorrectly,"The part shipped to me was an adapter that converts a 3.5mm female to 2.5mm male, the opposite of what is listed. It appears this is not the first time this has occurred. This should be taken care of immediately."
2,not so good,"I ordered this so I could use it for my phone and it has the metal piece on the end of it. It does fit properly, however when I attach it to the adapter piece that I use for the speaker in the first place, it hits the metal piece on it and it makes an awful static sound and will not stay in my phone too well. It is the proper item but it needs to be compatible with the non metal circle piece that you insert your headphones into work, not the actual metal. I received the pack of ten that I really don't need and cannot use anyway, so I will send them back and try to get the single piece that I can use for my device.D. Dellapenna"
1,this is the wrong one,"it has a 2.5mm male and 3.5mm female, so it is totally wrong one. Go to Fry's and head to the cell phone headset department and you will find the right one for $5"
1,Does not work for the Motorola v360,"Received this product by mistake by C-b-e4L--s (fill in the missing letters). It does not work for the Motorola v360, and probably any other cellphone. You must get a 2.5mm adapter with 3 rings. 2 ringed adapters are for mono and the mic only. You can get stereo output by not inserting the jack all the way in."
1,complete junk,"Really, there aren't many words to describe this. It is just terrible. Neither the male nor the female end fits properly. The sound quality is anything but. Buy this one instead: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003N114QW/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00"
1,bought 2 and only 1 worked,"I'm glad I purchased 2 since one of them was worthles. I wasn't even able to plug a cord into it since the guts were all out of whack. Just spinning it in your fingers you can see that the units are warped & very low quality. The price is not worth a refund attempt, but beware, these are bad."
2,Poor quality,"I thought that in buying this adapter, it would be a simple plug in that works...it doesn't work hardly at all. It has horrible connections and doesn't work half of the time, and has to be jiggled to make any sound come out. It also is crooked, as if it was just slapped together and could break at any minute. I thought that this would be a cheap fix for a fast adaption, but it's not even worth the dollar."
1,"garbage, don't buy it","this is garbage, do not buy it as it will just waist your time and you will need to buy it again from somewhere else"
1,sent me the wrong thing,"instead of a 2.5mm female to 3.5mm male adapter as described etc, I got a 3.5 female to 2.5 male adapter. this isnt even what i ordered"
3,Good unit but something missing,"This unit works fine and is as easy to set up as other Sigma units, BUT...this is supposed to work for two bikes. You can program and read out info for two bikes however nowhere in the online info does it say that one must purchase another special mounting bracket in order for it to work with another bike. My old Sigma computer used to allow the user to change between Bike 1 and Bike 2. This model does not. Keep this in mind if you plan to alternate between two different bikes."
2,good while it worked...,"This was great while it worked. Criticisms are:- wire for the cadence counter kept becoming disconnected.- The bit where the computer clips onto the mount broke after about 6 months of use, this was not repairable."
5,Great computer for the money,"I couldn't be happier with this computer. The install was very simple. The hardest part of the install was snapping the rubber bands into place. The back light was the main reason I got this computer and I can't complain.Amazon is the best place for this because of the free shipping. No where on the description does it mention the cadence kit, but it is INCLUDED with the computer."
4,so far so good,fyi to anyone buying this that wants cadence on there bike and they have an XL frame it didnt reach the area were it was to be mounted right. other wise nice unit love the lite i do alot of nite riding easy to read.....
1,Piece of crap...,"I bought this product recently, and tried to install it today but it just broke shortly after I thought I got it to work... this really is a piece of junk."
4,Comprehensive but too large!,"I'm passionate about FrontPage 2000 so I have checked out every FP 2000 book I can find. I bought this book (my fourth FP 2000 book) after reading the last couple of chapters in the bookstore.I find this book a very good reference to FrontPage 2000. Coverage is complete (or near-complete) and it offers great chapters on IIS and web planning. The writing is generally good, but the large volume (1200 pages) and heavy weight are due in part to ""wordiness"" of some chapters. The enclosed CD-ROM has a good collection of software, but alas, the best is not free, just demos.Database connectivity is covered, but not as well as ""FrontPage 2000: The Complete Reference"", which remains my favorite FP 2000 book, but the chapters on Office 2000 and FrontPage 2000 are welcome.While you can't go wrong with this book, getting ""the complete reference"" may give you just as much information on FP 2000 while helping save trees."
2,Too wordy - not enough examples,"I have found QUE books to be excellent in the past (dBASE IV was a gem), but this one falls a bit short. I continually find myself reading three or four pages of garbage before I get to the content I am looking for. When I get there, the example is too basic and then the next section starts.I didn't find the section on Scripting too informative and now I have to look into another book. I am not an advanced user of FP2000 so my low rating is not because of my need for an expert manual.The basic material was covered fairly well other than the blah, blah, blah. This book should be about half its size based on the same content.Why don't they give us a no fluff book (&CD) with a full example of an advanced site, explain it in the book and let the user figure out the rest. That's what I liked about the old dBASE IV book with its inventory system example."
1,Database section is weak,"I purchase this book to aid in the building of a database site. I was disappointed that the CD did not contain the sample files discussed in the book and the author did not respond to my email. In addition his website is emptyIf your goal is to be able to delete and modify records in a database then the six pages at the end of the chapter ""Advanced Database Techniques"" will most likely not be enough for you. This section of the chapter (p.870) begins by saying ""Frontpage does not provide a large amount of flexibility for more advanced data maintenance, such as deleting information, or editing information."""
5,"Using MS Frontpage 2000, QUE","Huge book and it took me 15 weeks at 3 chapters a week to go through BUT, it was worth it. Nothing was left undiscovered. I built a bunch of webs for clients along the way and the studying was worth it. I especially appreciated the second half of the book with its indepth chapters on all of the not so simple web page topics such as databases, Office 2000 integration and Intranets. Frontpage is revealed as a real corporate workhorse. I'm doing QUE Access 2000 now. Ugh, wish me luck."
3,Not as good as other Special Edition Books I have read...,"First, this book is pretty good in its coverage of the FrontPage product. However, I am not as happy with it as I was with other books in the Special Edition Using series, put out by Que. There are a number of typos in the text, and at times, the explanations do not seem clear. I had to read several parts over, as what I was reading was not all that clearly stated. I think that this book is good for those who want to learn FrontPage 2000, but I would browse other titles first."
4,Striving for new level of credibility.,I refer to this book frequently when counselling couples.Fresh outlook in some subjects are stimulating to aveteran counsellor.
3,Coming close,"Gottman has years of experience and his experience shouldn't be taken lightly. But to trust human relationships to modernism is a slippery slope that is leading society to reject tradition and endorse individualism. Gottman's book is an excellent collection of experience, but no one should consider it a 'bible' of marital interventions."
4,very good book for a relationship counselor,"This book was informative and enlightening. Gottman touches not only on the romantic relationship, but also on the parent-child relationship and other relationships. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to improve their relationships if only slightly."
1,I love the Vandals but...,"I dig the vandals. I really like their old stuff. This album has some killer songs, but... they attack Agent Orange. A band so much better, so much more talented. Why? They ruined the entire album w/ 1 song. I've gone to their shows, bought their albums... No one bashes Mike Palm and Agent Orange. This album disillusioned me. Why would Warren bash Agent Orange?????"
5,You Can Never Go Wrong With The Vandals,"If you have heard ""Live Fast Diahreah"" and ""Hitler Bad, Vandals Good"", but never ""The Quickening"", be prepared to not like it as much, AT FIRST. But then you begin to get ""Its A Fact"" stuck in your head on the way to school; and at your cousins wedding you begin humming the melody of ""Marry Me""; and every time you see a Muslim, you can't help but shout out ""Allah"", and lets not forget other hits like ""Canine Youthenasia"" and ""Taste Like Chicken"". And next time that bimbo in class talks to you, you'll just remember ""But Then She Spoke""."
1,salsa for the world,product not as described. the store not as promised to include $5.00 cash untill i request. the vhs can't use anymore been through away.
3,Strictly for the 3-6 mafia fan,"If your not a fan of 3-6 or the Memphis rap sound I don't think your gonna like this CD. This CD is Memphis made, by Memphis artist, for a Memphis audience. I bet alot of rap music fans in Memphis would tell you this is the greatest CD of all time. I know this is a release of some 3-6 underground hits but this is their worst release on CD in my opinion. Im not sayin' its weak, its better than average, but not as tight as all the other 3-6 maf CD's. If you love the 3-6 mafia then get this CD otherwise purchase at your own risk!"
2,"beatdown19@hotmail.com May19, 1999",This CD kinda sucks. There's a lot of mixin but the rappin doesn't empress me much. There's no Three 6 CD like WORLD DOMINATON!!!! 19 SHOTS from BombTown!!!!!!
3,all these junts i already got,this $hit iightnot daht 9ood i 9ot mo$t of this $hit from da original tapes
4,Best Hand gardening tool I have used.,"I am always looking for a way to get rid of weeds w/o using chemicals. It is not easy work, but this tool made it easier. It was even better at digging trenches over short distances."
5,law and order,I love this show.This episode was really good.Then again all of the Law and Order episodes are.The actors in this episode were soo good.The storytelling on here was also good.
1,law and order season 16,"To Amazon: Many, many MANY of us don't have the tech savvy to deal with streaming, MP3'ing from the computer to TV, etc. PLEASE when are you going to have Seasons 16 through 20 (the last five episodes) on DVD like the previous episodes. We are waiting....PLEASE!!!! Thank you kindly. Otherwise we regular old folks won't be able to have the last five episodes so we can watch them on DVD. PLEASE HELP!!!!!!!! Thank you so very much. Either that or maybe put step-by-step instructions on the site here as to how to fool with this new-fangled stuff so we can watch it on tv? Thanks again."
5,Probably Wilson's Best Sci-Fi,"Nine years after first attempting a Lovecraftian sci-fi novel in The Mind Parasites, Wilson made another stab at essentially the same plot, and wrote it much better, as The Space Vampires (Lifeforce). The major difference between the two - aside from a noticeably more mature approach in The Space Vampires - is the addition of plentiful story-required sex.Wilson's plots never move briskly, but they often make up for it by being intellectually engaging. The Space Vampires is a quick and interesting read, contrasting extraterrestrial criminals with the more common garden variety found on Earth. Discussions abound on predation, and the precise nature of sex in general.Filmed as Lifeforce in '85, the movie retained the basics of the plot, but went inexplicably overboard in directions Wilson wisely avoided. It is still a watchable movie, but not as good as Wilson's original novel."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"It is not often you see this in a dedication, not in a story:I must also express my warmest thanks to Count Olof de la Gardie, both for his hospitality at Raback, and for allowing me to inspect family papers relating to his ancestor Count Magnus.Energy sucking vampires from space, you got it.Some not too swift characters, as well :""That's easily explained. We both had a session with the Prime Minister two days ago. He doesn't believe these vampires are dangerous. So neither of us trusts him.""It takes a lack of belief in vampires to not trust a politician? No wonder the space vamps went for your area."
4,Good quality.,These sweats are comfortable and made well. They run a little long in the leg but not bad. I would definitely buy this brand again. I wear between a 38 and 40 waist depending on the brand and XL is a pretty good fit.
4,Comfortable,Old school sweats. Hard to find these anymore. Basic comfortable sweats. The sport grey seemed to run smaller than the ash grey color in the same size for some reason. Both still fit. Quality not to thin or extra thick either - in between.
4,Good Quality,"These are very comfortable, great quality sweatpants! I actually prefer pants with no pockets so these fit the bill perfectly for my needs. Will be purchasing more!"
4,Exactly what I ordered!,"Seller was very professional and trustworthy. Item is exactly what I expected. A plain, old pair of sweats to get me through another cold Chicago winter. Thanks..."
1,Cuff not as pictured/described,"Ordered these for my father, who specifically requires elastic cuffs. Based on the reviews and the description, this product was NOT what I ordered. The pants I received had no cuff, just a wide, boot-cut style bottom."
2,Sizes are WAY to big,The quality of the sweatpants are fine but the sizes are really jacked up. I ordered the medium and they are the equivalent of XL - to XXL. I am a 32-30 and these have about an extra 12 inches in length.
3,OK Product,These sweats are OK. Not a real disappointment but not superior quality either. I gave them three stars. Not the heavy material you are used to or that the ad line says they are. These sweats are relatively light weight. The elastic around the ankle area is not very elastic and the cuff really sort of sags. But there are the original style in a variety of colors. The price is OK. Overall an OK product.
2,Not happy,"Not sized comparably to other brands (too small to be a large), not what I call Heavy. I have given them away."
1,Gildan sweatpants,too baggy...i thought a small would be a regular small but this is way too baggy...wouldn't buy it again. they should have a XS.
1,crap,you get just what you pay for only not with this product I can assure you ..Dont even think youll save just pay 2 times ...
1,DO NOT GET PEACE OF CRAP,I RECEIVED THE TORCH ALL LOOKED GOOD WHEN I FILLED IT THE FILLER VALVE LEAKED ALL THE BUTANE LEAKED OUT I WOULD SPEND THE MONEY FOR A BETTER TOURCH
1,Does not work. Do not buy!,Tried filling up the torch with Zippo Butane Fuel at least 10 times. Doesn't work. What a waste of money. I would recommend not buying this product.
2,2 use blunder,I only got 2 uses out of this before it wouldn't even keep the butane in i Thought i would of had better luck but i guess not.
1,Not worth the price!,I bought many of these because of the price. They are NOT worth even $.50 each. Butane leaks on all of the ones I bought. You'll use it once and set it down. Then the next time it will be dead. They don't hold fuel. Period. They MUST be made over seas. CHEAPLY. Buyer beware.
1,it's wery easy to break...,"this product was looking very good wright out of box... but than when i fillet it with fuel and tried to light it up, it worked... but for the second time it didn't lit up... i got really upset..."
1,Below poor quality,"This product is absolutely horrible. The only reason why it's rated a one is because there is no zero button. The day i received it it broke, in fact it broke within the first five minutes of use! I filled it with butane, turned the nob, and it broke! Just like that! Do not buy this product! Its a waste of 5 dollars."
2,okay,"theres no spark n the on and off valve are finicky, fluid goes fast. could be smaller upping its portability"
1,Junk,I bought this to replace one that was stolen. Mine was of the same general design but shorter and fatter. I thought this was going to be a good torch. The flame is good but that is all. The flame only lasts for about 20 seconds and then you have to refill it again. The torch is cheap Chinese stuff. Even the paper wrapping on the torch itself is of low quality and tends to peel off. The on/off twist is also cheap filling. I tried using this several times but the flame time is so short that it becomes useless. I would not recommend this torch.
2,Nope...not what i was expecting,This is actually my first purchase that i am not happy with. The torches are very poor quality. I say you are losing money here. You should just spend the extra money and get a good torch if your looking. I have had pencil torches in the past of much better quality than this product...2 outta 5
1,Broken On Second Use,"I bought this pencil torch from The Battery Geek for $3.21 and used it once and it worked flawlessly. The second time I refilled it with butane, I tried to light it and it shot out all the butane like a lighter and stopped working afterwards. I can't even refill it anymore as it spews all the gas back out. Save your money and buy a more professional one. I will be avoiding this seller."

4,Good overview,"roni horn has had a strong impact on contemporary photography . Her works incorporate the ideologies of many important movements of contemporary art which have been underrepresented in the fine art photgraphy world....this may be contested but i think that in the majority of the FA Photography there are extremely conservative currents, that run back to its stepchild role among the ""truely"" fine arts. Thankfully horn represents a challenging view for photography."
2,Truth in advertising?,The cover of the book I received was totally different than the photo and the condition of the book was way worse than the description. Otherwise the book was a fun read. At times it was hard to get past the British English spelling and grammar.
4,Beware of AC Adapter that comes with this product,"Overall I was very pleased with the quality of the product but unfortunately had to send the kit back b/c the AC Adapter included was not the one advertised. This kit comes with an EH-52 rather than the stated EH-53. I needed an EH-53. My Nikon says that if I used anything but I could overheat the components. If your camera can use an EH-52, this is a great buy."
3,filters,"As far as this kit goes, the AC adapter is superfluous since one came with the camera. Still, the card reader with software may be worth the price. The other items are just little niceties.The inclusion of filters in any kit by Nikon would be nice!One has to purchase an adapter that fits over the zoom, snugged up by an O ring. Then, any 52mm filter will work. Look for a Coolfix adapter."
1,very poor,"Background, I play classical music, viola, and have been professional for 35 years. I've been through quite a few tuners in that time. I use a tuner regularly as I practice.I suppose it is possible that I got a slightly defective unit, but it acts like just a poor tuner. I clipped it to my scroll, it's bigger than I had expected and would seem huge on a violin. It usually takes 3-4 seconds to figure out what note I'm playing and dances around with the pitch lights for longer before it (usually) settles on one. Several times though it never figured out even an open string, especially the D. Yesterday I saw that I could NEVER use this while practicing, so today I decided to just tune all my strings with it, and finally gave up in frustration. And this thing is expensive too. I hope they will take it back.I recommend getting aKorg CA-40 Chromatic Tunerwith the Korg CM-100 Tuner Clipfor less money ( I did reviews on those too) and you'll have a truly fine tuner setup."
2,Hate It!,"This tuner is an unrealistic choice for professionals.In real gig / dark invirons, this tuner is hard to see which is a deal breaker for me. Also, changing the battery requires that you first unscrew one of the 3 mini screws on the back of the unit - another deal breaker as this takes an unrealistic amount of time and requires a specialized tool."
5,Awesome.,"This movie is so much fun! As Robert Rodriguez proved his truly awesome talent two years ago with Sin City (also with El Mariachi, Desperado, and From Dusk Till Dawn), he scores once again with Planet Terror. It's a zombie film made in an old-school way, featuring hardcore violence, awesome music and pervasive dark comedy. I hope you have fun!"
2,"True to it's mission it's boring, and overhyped","No better than any other low-budget B movie from the 70s. I'm not sure why this generated so much hype. My guess is the director's name. It really is nothing special. It has it's boring moments, gross moments, and horrific moments, and it seems to deliver in the original ratio of 1:2:2.Anyway, for what it's worth: enjoy it, I was kind of disappointed."
2,"Very ""Pop""","Planet Terror is a satire. It is sick to look at, has characaters with a very loud presence and it doesn't really evoke a human touch like Death Proof did. I thought it was terrible to honest especially cause I loved Death Proof. Now, you're laughing thinking I'm the only person who probably liked Death Proof more. Planet Terror is like a flaky irritating push on all action films that have been made. It tries to be clever but then even Scary Movie tried.Overall, a 5/10Bruce Willis has no role, Naveen Andrews is after testicles in the film (!) and the storyline is just a sham. The sort of film I don't want to be reminded of. Even the average 28 Weeks Later was better."
4,Rose McGowan,A well written story involving a town and the people who come together to try and save it. Choosing the lead actress (Rose) was the best as she was able to complete the story and make it come to life. Recommend anyone who enjoyed Sin City to give this a view as it will be well worth your time.EROTIC SCI-FI 1 (4PC) / (EXCO BOX) - EROTIC SCI-FI 1 (4PC) / (EXCO BOX)
5,Excellent,DVD arrived as scheduled and has been a wild film to enjoy. I think I have to say this genre has become guilty pleasure.
4,the better half of grindhouse,dont get me wrong i like death proof but planet terror i love more so!plant terror is your basic gore fest! the tounge scene is bad A**!in a nutshell its dawn of the dead meets the stand meets outbreak meets rose with one leg! there is alot of comedy in this film as well. it would really suck to have your package just kind of melt away.but all in all the film is great. p.s ONE OF THE TRAILERS ARE BACK!
4,separation was the best thing,"the cult of q can listen to those fugly broads yap about absolutely nothing for 5 hours while us normal people can watch a real ode to grindhouse experience without using a ff button.with planet terror,theres some cockamamie,dare i type,convoluted ''plot'' about some chemicle warfare that goes awry (theres a 1st!).but thats the beauty of it all.if it had an actual plot that made sense,it wouldnt be grindhouse.the only thing purposely worse than the plot was the acting.the broads were super hot and the action was non stop.exactly what grindhouse is all about.the ironic part is,blabentino's 10 minutes was the worst part of this."
1,Thanks for nothing,I loved Grindhouse at the movie theaters. Despite its poor success at the box office. I have been so excited to see this Dvd. Only to find out they are going to screw there fans by releasing Planet Terror and DeathProof seprately. So I would have payed $30 for a special edition for both movies together. Instead out of protest I will buy neither. Why whould you do this to your fans. Nobody else cares about the movie and the fans have spoken. Its not to late to package the movies together.
3,"Grab your pizza, beer, and...BBQ sauce and get ready for some mindless zonbie fun","Well, I think my title says it all.""Planet Terror""...Robert Rodriguez's first half of the experimental 2007 Grindhouse experience. As the cliche goes...before you go in leave your brain at the door. But in this case, that could be taken literally (as one scene in the film will explain that.)Anyway, is this film good? No, not really. Its premise is just as stupid as countless other Seventies Grindhouse-style films. But what makes this one different is that it was made in the digital film age, so the special and visual effects are better than those achieved 30-40 years ago. Of course, the aging, scratching, and even film melting effects are put in it intentially which actually disguises it to the point of it being such a bad movie thus making it somewhat of an instant classic."
2,low budget,"if you like lots of gore in a mutant smashing zombie thriller, this is the one. But unfortunately their low-budget has caused a deleted scene towards the end which leaves the viewer a bit confused. Perhaps they should have used the money they spent on the director's cut and done the scene properly."
2,GREEDY DIRECTOR'S BIG SCAM!!!,"THIS FILM COULD HAVE REALY BEEN COOL ,HOWEVER IT IS RUINED BY MISSING FOOTAGE AND THE DIRECTOR;S GREED. THE MIDDLE OF THE FILM IS BOTH DESTRACTING AND DESJOINTED BY SUDDEN MISSING FOOTAGE ,WHICH IS A DISGRACE. ON ONE OF THE FEW BONUS FEATURES OF THE SINGLE DISC EDITION OF PLANET TERROR ,DIRECTOR ROBERT RODRIGUEZ STATED THAT THE ""MISSING REEL"" WOULD BE ON THE TWO-DISC EDITION OF THE MOVIE, HOWEVER THIS WAS NOTHING BUT A CONFOUNDED LIE. AND NOW WITH THE RELEASE OF PLANET TERROR-EXTENDED AND UNRATED(TWO-DISC SPECIAL EDITION, IT STILL DOES NOT CONTAIN THE ""MISSING REEL"".HOW MANY MORE EDITION ARE WE EXPECTED TO BUY BEFORE THE ""MISSING FOOTAGE IS AVAILABLE, THATS IF IT ACTUALY EXISTS!!!. IT WOULD SEEM THAT EVEN DIRECTOR ROBERT RODRIGUEZ IS CONTENT WITH TAKING HIS FAITHFUL MOVIE FANS LAST DIME FOR HIS OWN FINANCIAL GAIN."
1,Trash from the Weinstein Company.,"This is pure trash. As bad as the awful Sin City film, and even more stupid then Hellboy. Do not buy it or rent it, or download it from the net.It is trash and it is time we spend our money to buy real movies on DVD instead."
4,"Part 1 of the awesome ""Grindhouse""","This is Part 1 of the 2007 fun-fest ""Grindhouse"". Great Transfer, another bonus is the ""scratch-free"" version! Robert Rodriguez goes over-the-top in his homage to 70's & 80's zombie - exploitation flicks. Lots of gore, sexy bad-ass women, perfect ""grindhouse"" movie fun!"
4,Don't eat the barbeque!!!,"Ray is back in town, he's a legendary shot; he never misses. It's a good thing, because there is a virus that has been unleashed on his hometown. A military unit has come to do research on it. The virus always turns it's victims into insane bloodthirsty zombies. The townsfolk must band together to kill the zombies and fight off the military.This is a gory splatter fest. It has tons of action and some pretty disgusting parts. But the violence is presented in a comedic manner. This movie is kind of an action comedy actually. The cast is pretty good, and the story is a lot of fun. This movie delivers laughs and thrills galore. It's a lot of fun."
1,Quailing reviewers make shallow graves,"The movie made no money in the theaters.So they split it into two DVD's and are now charging you $35.98 for a movie that should have been $17.99.Don't listen to the sheep who say ""Just buy it. Maybe they'll release both together in the future. What else can we do?"".Don't buy this, and send a message to the production companies that you will not be victimized by corporate price gouging.If you must see it again, there are other sources."
1,Disgusting,Disgusting...Ive been waiting for months for this to come on DVD and now they want to charge me 50 bucks to buy two dvds...forget that...very disappointed that such A class directors stooped this low.
2,The weaker half,"Not as good as Death Proof but an okay movie. Funny and strange go hand and hand in this movie. Death proof I would recommend to a lot of friends, while Planet Terror I would recommend to a select few who might be into this horror tongue and cheek genre."
3,Gory B-movie loaded with action and entertainment,"Stylelized zombie flick that has a innovative visual look to it that pays homage to 80's b movies and john carpenter theme music. the movie is heavy on the gore which I felt some scenes were unnessary as this movie has alot going for it to be greater. rose mcgowan really does steal the show, kind of a fun movie."
3,Not bad at all,This was super cheap for a splatter flick with Tom Savini getting his finger bitten off or was it shot off? doesn't really matter I guess.
4,what is it about Quentin?,I keep trying to hate this stuff but can't look away. Everything terrible about '70's drive in trash is there. A guilty pleasure. Tarantino is Troma with a budget.
2,Mildly entertaining at best,Typical zombie movie. Lots of outlandish violence and gore. A few good bits of dialogue. But nothing special. At least it was not as boring as Deathproof. Not really even worth renting this unremarkable film.
3,"the better of the two films from Grindhouse, though not spectacular","I just waited for this one to come out to video, I would have hated to see what the abreviated version in the theater was like. But, as expected, didn't care for this movie much. Although compaired to death proof, it was an acadamy award winning film. First off, its a take off of an old B rate movie, the simulated poor film quality and editing. With all the movie technology and graphics and film options, I don't want to see and old choppy/scratchy film. If I wanted that, I'll rent attack of the Killer tomatos, or planet of the apes, something classic, not simulated. Second off, Its a zombie movie, what the heck. Nothing fancier than a B rate zombie movie. I guess there must be a market for this Artsy stuff, or the film wouldn't have been made. I guess I am to sober of a person to ""catch the buzz"" about this movie."
1,You have got to be kidding!!!!!,"Come on folks - anyone who thinks this was a good movie is really brain dead!! And I mean brain dead! Poorly shot, poorly scripted and just plain awful. I love good B movies - usually a little far out, a little raunchy - silly but reasonably effective special effects - often less is more especially on a small budget. However, this movie had absolutely no redeeming features - nothing! Please don't don't waste you time or money on this useless movie.PS I only rated it one start because they don't allow you to not award at least 1. It's really a Zero rating."
2,What are they doing?!!!,"I have been a huge Rodriguez fan for most of his career so when I heard he was making Grindhouse, with Tarantino, I was more then excited about the whole concept. I saw the movie twice in theaters. Even though I was a little disappointed with Tarantino's half, the movie ""as a whole"" was what it was meant to be, entertaining. I cannot believe they decided to split them up! Are you kidding me?! And they're dumping the trailers too?!!! I don't know what kind of extras they're planning on having on either of these but they better be damn good! You know what? This was an extremely bad call for the Weinstein Co. or whoever's decision it was. They've gotta release them together at some point, right? I'm gonna have to wait? I hate waiting!"
3,A bit of a disappointment for me,"Well, I finally got around to watching this movie and I was kind of disappointed. Yes, I knew going in that it was deliberately cheesy, but the grainy, scratchy look got old fast, and the story line is weak and jumbled. Plus, the incessant gore got disgusting fairly quickly. Loved Rose McGowan; she's super-hot and comes across as a sharp, funny lady. Otherwise, I found the movie kind of tiring after a while. I'd give it 2.5 stars if Amazon allowed half-star ratings."
4,The orignal sounds fun,"I never got the chance to see this in theaters and I wish they left the movie like it was. The movie itself was a decent flick. Lots of big name stars who didnt really seem to gel with the type of movie. Fergie? come on. Dont look for the meaning of life in this film. Just action, gore, and a few laughs. I was bored during the middle of the film but the end was pretty over the top. They say on the back cover one of the most memorable screen heroines ever. Considering she is that for the last fifteen minutes, id disagree. It was cool character but not something i'd watch a awhole movie about. Pretty good if you just want senseless killing and lots of blood."
4,"""Not Bad!""",Rose McGowan and more star in Robert Rodriguez's2007 action horror film. A go-go dancer and otherstry to stop virus-infected zombies. This isn't badand this dvd has good picture and sound plus neatextras. I recommend this.
4,Not bad - but not art.,"While not as good as it's double-feature sister, this is a great movie to sit back and watch on an October Saturday night."
5,You and me against the world!,"""Planet terror"" is a project that might be labeled as a futuristic catharsis, that works out as a deserved homage to Cesar Romero's ""The night of the living dead.""A mortal poisoned gas affects, accelerates and transfigure the human race, and the only human capable to find an antidote is out of business.Watch this film with a basic premise in mind. Don't try to analyze it, just to have fun with his gore scenes, bloody sequences and black humor. A four hand project between Rodriguez and Tarantino. Some hair raising chases here and there and the presence of captivating women make the film worthy to watch it, but, don't dare to take it too seriously.And have a good time!"
4,PLANET TERROR,"THIS MOVIE IS GREAT , ITS SO DIFFERENT YET THE SAME AT THE SAME TIME, WOW FIGURE THAT OUT AND YOUR A BRAIN, SOME OF IT AVERAGE BUTT FOR THE YEAR IT WAS THE BEST MOVIE OF ACTION GORE AND LITTLE FUNNY"
4,Very Entertaining,I must say that when I first saw this movie that I didn't think it was that good and I thought that it was the lesser of the two 'Grindhouse' movies. I recently purchased it and I definitely have a different view of the movie and really enjoyed it. I have watched it several times since the purchase. The characters are hilarious cliches. I really enjoyed Jeff Fahey and Michael Biehn as two brothers trying to get the best BBQ sauce in Texas. Josh Brolin is excellent as Dr. Block and his wife Dakota and her father are just great characters.Really like this movie for all it quirkiness and for it drive in style.
3,Planet Terror,"If your sick of the news, well there is something wrong with the air,what a gas the war is...."
2,Planet Terror,"I think I was 48 minutes into this gem when I got smart, hit stop and ejected it out of the DVD player. Although not great Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof at least had some catchy dialog."
3,Good for what it was... would have preferred a serious film,"PLANET TERROR was good for what it was..... namely a zombie spoof film that paid homage to Drive-In films of the 1970s.Of course it was over the top and cheesy.The budget, special effects, and other film making aspects of the film were quite good which made me think to myself....... ""Wow just imagine how good they could have made this film if they had used all these resources to make a serious horror/action film..... man they even had Savini to help them out""So in summary....... it was good for what it was, but I would have enjoyed it more if they used all those resources to make a serious version of the same basic screenplay idea."
3,Inspired by Army Of Darkness,"First off, if you think this is a Bruce Willis film, think again, he's in it for about 5 seconds.Mostly it's that chick from Charmed, she loses a leg and her superman boyfriend rams a gun onto it and she becomes a wonder woman on acid to blow away zombies in a blood filled dismembering gorefest of a way.Good for a rental, but I wouldn't wanna own it."
4,Entertaining!,Here is another entry into the spoof the Night of the Living Dead series. This one is highly entertaining. It is made like it is being shown in a cheap movie theater in the 70's with breaks in the film and coming attractions to other movies (they show a spoof called Machete). Rose McGowan alone makes this movie as she is one of the sexiest looking stars in movies. During the movie she loses a leg but her boyfriend later replaces it with a machine gun for which she then starts mowing down the zombies. My only question is how did she fire that gun since it is attached to a hook on her leg stump?
3,SO SO EXPLOITATIVE FILM,An homage to the zombie genre and old exploitation films. There's some cute moments in here (the one legged woman) but I think I prefer the old original movies flavor wise. This isn't really terrifying and tries to go for the dark humor of the genre and sometimes succeeds. But overall this film made me wanting to watch something else but I was surfing the Web as I did it so it didn't matter too much. STORY/PLOTTING; C plus to B minus; CHARACTERS: B minus;GENRE: C plus; OVERALL GRADE: C plus to B minus; WHEN WATCHED: early September 2011.
4,One of the better movies to come out...,"This is one of the better movies to come out so far, it takes real world gore with a twist of old movie style blended so well together it has the watcher begging for more. The plot itself was surprising even in it's simplicity, as an avid horror and zombie fan myself I was more then pleasantly surprised by this film. Definetly a must see for all allotted ages. Kudos Rodriguez."
1,Angered Fan,"I hate the fact that I have to endure the butchering of this film. I may only be 32, I may only be considered as having no knowledge of the ""Grindhouse"" genre, but I most resent the splitting up of the two films. I'm so sorry the rest of America was too damned lazy to sit through it, but I did. Half way through, I had to pee like the dickens. But did I complain, no. The films were brilliant from beginning to end. And to split it into two is insulting. Put it onto DVD the way it was meant to be shown: in Widesreen, with both features fully intact, with the in-between trailers. Do it and do it soon."
2,i didn't like it,well i really didn't liked it i was bored all the time except the gore who was terrible and very well made but there are scratch all the time it is funny a little bit but in all the movie???????i didn't like sin city too maybe it is not my kind of movies so long folks
1,Truly aweful !,"This is really one of the worst action movies I ever saw. There is really no plot to it, just endless senseless action scenes in which hundreds are killed. It seemed to me that the makers had just decided to throw all sorts of potential scenes from other action movies into this one.But I should have known it better, when I read that Quentin Tarantino was behind this flick. Avoid at all cost, or else be sorry for wasting your time."
1,lame lame lame,"nope not talking about grindhouse, it was one of my favorite films of the year..great entertainment..no im talking about the fact that they have ruined this film in the dvd release by essentially cutting the movie in half releasing it as two separate films killing what the movie was suppsed to be anyway, a great homage to grindhouse double features. any no trailers either in between and probably none of the other hilarious between film stuff. oh yeah, and ""extended version""? why? the frickin movie was perfect as it was. tack that stuff on the end in extras if you have too. until the grindhouse i saw in the theater is released on dvd i wont be watching it."
5,"Quit your whining, or I'll have your balls!","Everyone needs to quit their moaning! Just because the two Grindhouse features are now released seperatley on DVD doesn't mean we can't enjoy them as much! I saw Grindhouse in theatres and let me say that it was a unique awesome expirience,and I know buying, renting (whatever your prefrence) them on DVD is completely different than the expirience in theatres and I will also buy the double feature grindhouse when that is out on DVD, but they are still two great films! So don't boycott just buy these two and see what I'm talking about...or I guess just wait for the double feature DVD....just don't bag on something you don't know."
3,Too much blood and gore,"I know that this move is produced as a 'homage' to this genre of movies. Yet, this is too much blood and gore for me. Unless you are a die hard Robert Rodriguez fan, and part of Rodriguez/Tarantino cult, you are not going to like this."
5,"""Now give me my Lap Dance""!","I loved both movies. My personable favorite was ""The Girls"" story in Death Proof! I was stunned with the ending of their story (Ya...talking about breaking a leg) it was so unexpected! Kurt Russell for sure gets it right here. He's good in this role! This movie rocks!"
4,Good 80's style Horror/Action comedy....not really Grindhouse though.....,"The conceit of this movie is that it's supposed to be a throwback to the type of exploitation movies that they used to make in the 1970's. The problem is that Planet Terror feels closer to a spoof of 1980's Horror/Action flick. Now, there's nothing wrong with that and it doesn't mean that I don't love PT, as I do, but that's not what a ""grindhouse"" movie is supposed to be which is transgressive. Sure, Planet Terror has lot of gore and action but it truly doesn't plumb the depths of depravity like Crank 2: High Voltage which, IMHO, is a TRUE modern day exploitation masterpiece. I'm also thankful that the Blu-ray edition allowed me to watch the movie without all the annoying fake scratches and discoloration as I'm a fan of digital moviemaking and PT is a beautiful looking movie that shows the potential of digital cinematography. I'm also pleased with the extras and have no complaints."
5,Camcorder to Laptop,I purchased this because my HP laptop had the small Firewire connection and so does my Sony Camcorder. Works great for coonecting the both together.
4,Does Its Job,"Cables are simple items, they should do their job, they shouldn't get in the way, and they shouldn't fall apart.This cable seems to be well built, the connectors are solid and make a good connection, so the only question left is its durability. That will only become clear after extended usage and/or quite some time, so time will tell."
3,Mr.,Sometimes the narration is too fast and the effectiveness is lost. It also does not work on all dvd players. It is useful but I am not using it as much as I anticipated.
2,check with your doctor before taken this,"made me awful sick. I got weak, no energy, sweating and had to go to bed to recover. I thought I was coming down with a cold. But I took it a few days later and had the same symtoms."
5,Help for Liver,"Spectrum of herbs and nourishment for healing the liver in one capsule. Simple, easy, effective. Helps restore health to ailing liver. No guessing, no inconvenience of hunting down various heath supplements known to reverse liver damage because combined into a single capsule."
2,Thin on content and originality,"I was looking forward to reading this short book to help take my mind off the infertility craziness. However, I found the book to be as thin on content as it was in size. I guess I expected too much from a 33 page book, but a reiteration of things I already knew and had heard in many other places was not what I expected. There is very little original content in this book and if you've been on the infertility ride for more than a month, you already know everything in the book. I was hoping for new insights, original ideas, personal stories that would touch me and help me connect with my own feelings. None of that happened. I don't know that it's even worth the $4."
1,No new info gained,"I read this 33 page book in 30 minutes. It did not provide me with any new information. I was and still am looking for information on ""Clomid"". My doctor will be prescribing that to me shortly and I thought I was getting a book that would explain the medicine in greater detail. All information in the book I already had heard or read before."
1,Title misleading,"I was actually looking for books which would talk about health implications on drining coffee, as I am a heavy coffee drinker.I had read about Clomid a lot and wanted to know the implicaitons of coffee for Clomid taking people. Very disappointed. The book did not talk about that, however the book elaborated on carrying positive feelings for people who are trying to conceive."
1,"Looks cool, works horribly.","Purchased these on a whim, but almost all the CD-R's copy improperly (static on audio, unrecognizable tracks). Even budget silver CD-Rs perform better than these. Avoid at all costs."
1,Worst.Blank.CDs.Ever,"Quite simply these do not work... I have a brand new Dell M1530 with a top of the line burner and it will not recognize these disks. I have tried several colors and they won't burn. There's a beautiful red Memorex ""coaster"" on my desk as I type this. Junk!"
1,Don't work with Macs.,"This is the second spindle of Memorex recordable media I've had to trash because they are not compatible with my Macbook Pro - I earlier tossed a pack of 25 Memorex DVDs, too. Shame on me for getting fooled twice, I guess. I'll never buy Memorex media again, that's for certain. I have no problems using Sony media with my machine, and I will stick to that brand even though it costs a bit more."
5,I love these,"I have been looking for these as they were the last blanks I had that worked well in my cd player. Not to say they work any better than other high quality cd-r's only that I cheaped out and bought a big pack of maxell discs and they don't work. I've thrown out at least half of the discs I've tried to use.These discs are great, and the colors are so nifty. It's not just a colored label, the entire CD is the color. They're lovely. Great for gifts, especially for people who like shiny things."
2,Midwest Mexican Food,"The Good:Lots of pretty picturesClear instructionsThe Bad:""The Book of Mexican Foods"" by Christine Barrett lacks culturally important and interesting Mexican dishes. The book includes dubious Mexican recipes such as "" Eggs With Potatoes & Ham"" and others, while leaving out the following common and important dishes: menudo, barbacoa, chili rellenos, and pork rinds. I have owned this book for over ten years and have yet to use it."
4,Tasty recipes for you & your family to enjoy!,"Cookbook has an easy to follow format with photos for every recipe. At the beginning of the book the author does an introduction with a brief history of Mexican cooking, explains ingredients & equipment recommended. She has a basics section which shows how to make recipes such as corn tortillas, refried & regular beans, cooked tomato sauce. There are a lot of creative & tasty recipes to enjoy. Some ususual dishes included are: ""Lemon-Tequila Souffle,"" ""Chorizo & Cheese Crepes,""Vermicelli Soup,"" ""Picadillo"" & more. If you enjoy mexican food this cookbook is good for learning some of the basics. The dessert recipes are excellent! Wish the main dishes were more elaborate but the recipes in the book are good."
5,Love It!,I love watching Art 21 while working on my jewelry. I love to be informed on what is happening in the art world. It is also nice to be able to keep records for future reference.
2,Audio es pésimo...,"Es buen contenido, pero muuuy mal audio. Tengo un teatro en casa excelente, y el audio que sale del DVD es como si fuera grabado en VHS. Olvidate de tu equipo 5.1."
2,Falls Short,A so-so performance of Beethoven's finest symphony -- and the engineering of the disc hardly takes advantage of the spacial and resolution capabilities of DVD-Audio.You'd be better off buying the Leonard Bernstein recording of the 9th in old-fashioned stereo.Buy this only if you feel you absolutely need a six-channel recording of the Ode to Joy -- but prepare to be disappointed.
2,Not up to snuff,"This is a disappointing recording in many ways. The performance is not particularly inspired, although it's adequate. More importantly, while it may be on DVD, it doesn't include all six channels. In fact, after listening to the rather thin sound, I performed some tests and found that all that's on this disc appears to be the right and left, and the center front channel. The other three channels are missing. There are plenty of other terrific classical DVD Audio discs out there, but unfortunately, this isn't one of them.And, it doesn't play on all DVD Audio players, most notably the player on the Acura TL."
5,"JRZ SYSTEM - Great Music, Great Guys!",I have had the honor of seeing JRZ System play live many time and I must say that their music is very professional and unique. These guys blow me away. :-)-Austin
5,One word....BRILLIANT!,"Here at shredzone.com we have browsed through hundreds of CD's/demos reviewd a few and loved even fewer still. JRZ system has to be the most entertaining and provactive album we've heard in years. Our site is dedicated to free advanced guitar lessons and the promotion of instrumental guitar oriented music, and this album hits the mark 99.9 percent on-target! Keep up the great work guys -Tommy Merry"
3,Disappointing Read,"I was so disappointed in this book. I loved Elizabeth Adler's book, The Last time i Saw Paris and expected this book to be equally as good. Although the setting in Tuscany, was wonderful, I found little else of interest in this book. The characters were boring and the story line was weak."
2,"Fun, but distracting mistakes","As in other books, Ms. Adler really needs to do some research. It is hugely distracting to just begin a novel and hear such mistakes as a fully trained physician being called a resident. Over and over we are beat about the head about Gemma being poor. Excuse me, but why? A fully trained, experienced emergency room physician should be able to comfortably support her daughter and herself. I almost turned the CD off many times because this was so annoying. Gemma herself was a bit annoying, to tell you the truth. A bit too much martyrdom for my taste."
2,Wrong Summer in Tuscany,"I was reading along, wondering when I was going to get to the part about living and coping in Tuscany. This romantic, 1950s type, novel could have been called Summer in Texas for all it tells you about the life around Tuscany. Finally I came to Amazon.com, looked up the title, and lo and behold, I am reading the wrong book. I wanted ""A Summer in Tuscany"" by Swanson. I might try to finish this book but it is a piece of fluff better suited to the fuel the romantic fantasies of teenage girls rather than satisfying the desire of travelers anxious to learn about living in Tuscany."
4,A fun book,My second Elizabeth Adler book which I enjoyed very much.It is the perfect book to take to the beach. Enjoy!
3,Weak book for Adler,"I always expect Adler to send out all kinds of tentacles in her books and at the end, tie everything together. This is not a typical Adler book. I enjoyed the descriptions of Italy, the plot was weak, but was fun to read, put down and not think about again.I always call these kind of books ""Visa paying books."" By that, I mean its a short, quick, nothing book that everyone will buy because it has an author's name on it that you like and then the author can pay their monthly Visa bill. A no-effort book. Instead of buying, go to the library."
2,"Don't take this as binding, but...","The 2001 edition of this book has many typos, at least in the first 10-20 pages I've read so far. Some serious stuff, like wrong anwsers and mismatching explanations. Of course, the 2002 edition might be better."
1,DO not buy from Cardinal!,"The dominoes came damaged, smelled & were scuffed with stains on them. Very poorly made in CHINA. DO not buy, will be returning them. I really MISS anything made in the USA, gone are the days when merchandise was made with quality instead of slapped together...very upsetting, especially the toxic smell."
2,dominos,I had used these same dominos @ other friends homesAnd always enjoyed playing. However my set arrived with inkImperfections on 2 tiles and nothing I've tried will removeThe ink on the back. :(
1,Cardinal Fifteen Dot Dominoes,"These Dominoes came damaged. There were not enought number 14's in the box. And, there were too many number 13's, like 27. There should be only 15 of each number in the box. I had these sent to a grand-daughter in Ohio, where I was going on vacation. It was disapointing to discover that there was a mix up in the box. When I called they said they would send another box, too find out there were many hoops to jumb through. My son is too send them back, needless to say I, had to come home, and was disapointed in the return process."
3,Poor shipping and poor quality of product.,"This product was shipped from Amazon in a cardboard box with two sets of dominoes in metal tins. Amazon did not use the proper packing materials to prevent these tins from being damaged during shipment. Further, the quality of the dominoes is poor, they are of various thicknesses and have blemishes to allow players who have used these for several games to be able to identify certain dominoes. In my opinion; these were not worth the money."
3,Cheap tin of Dominoes,"I bought this for my son to set up and knock over. They dots on several we a bit messed up, but he isn't using them to play the game so they work out just fine. If that is what you want to use them for, these are a cheap choice. The only issue with that is they have rounded edges and they tend to knock over easy, so setup can get frustrated for a 10 year old. A set with a unrounded edge would be better."
1,BROKEN during shipment,"Dominoes arrived one time and as expected. However, the center holder for the train was broken. This game is difficult to play without this piece!"
2,"Great game, but quality is lacking","We bought this set of dominos because we have a set at a vacation house and enjoy playing 'Mexican Train' a lot - it is a great family game. This set of dominos came with a 'starter' (a piece of plastic that you can place the starting doubles in and plug in dominos to start your train), a set of 4 or 6 game pieces (used to signify whether your train is 'open' or not) and a full set of double 15 dominos.My main gripe is that two of the dominos were, basically, blemished. The first one had some of the paint that is used to fill the dots, fall out. It makes me wonder if any others are going to do the same. The second domino had a scrape in the back of it. I tried to use some rubbing compound to get the scrape out; however the rubbing compound sank into some cracks that I could not see or feel. I would up sanding the back of the domino down to make it so that the cracks would not show. Maybe I am a little picky, but is seems the quality control could be improved."
3,Why the color change?,"Dominoes are dominoes, no? So why did the manufacturer not just add some additional colors on for the 15 dot dominoes instead of changing so many to bland, unappealing colors? It slows down scoring if you are used to 12 dot, and then change to the 15 dot of different color because your eye gets used to certain dot patters AND the color for the numbers."
3,Little disappointed,"Received the box of dominoes and first time out of box some were dirty, a few had something red stained on them. No pattern on back just p,ain white. Since I bought them for the kids to play with I didn't send them back but was disappointed, I felt like they had been used then returned to shelf and sent to me as new.Cardinal Double 12 Color Dot Mexican Train Dominoes in Tin"
2,Don't buy from Amazon (domino pieces are too thin),"I bought this set from Amazon/Target thinking it was identical to the one at Target. Well, the two sets have the same name and are made by the same manufacturor. But the pieces contained in this set are way thinner than the same set bought at a physical Target store. The thicker dominos are way more fun. Buy yours at a Target store."
3,We love it,"We have already had a double twelve colour dot domino, but when we saw that a 15 dot exists we decided to buy it.All our friends love playing it. During holidays it is our favourite passtime."
5,great game,"On a positive side, if you are an adult, you will still have great fun playing this game. The pieces are different colours which makes it easy to match.On a downside, the pieces are made of heavy plastic so the shipment outside US was a little bit expensive. Also the game can be played by up to 8 people but the pack only had 3 little trains.Overall, it's a great game and I would definitely recommend it."
5,Dominoes 15 set,"Great game for kids and for adults. We have an adult group that plays this game every two weeks and we can't wait until the next time rolls around. This set is very sturdy and colorful and will last a long, long time."
2,"Poor quality, but great game","I purchased this item as a gift for a family member after they had lots of fun playing with my set. I was very disappointed to open their gift with them for Christmas to see that this set (which is from the same manufacturer as my own set) now sells a poor quality, inferior product.The list of poor qualities includes the following:- The colors of the dots were not bright at all and very close in shades of color (which makes it almost impossible to distinguish diferent numbered dominoes)- Many of the dominoes I received in this new set were discolored (i.e., ""off-white"" when all the others were ""white"").- Many dominoes had missing/chipped paintThe game itself is excellent and a lot of fun, but I would recommend buying it from a different manufacturer rather than Cardinal."
2,typical china,Pladed a game with these and couldn't figure out what was wrong and then found that a tile was mismatched and the wrong color. Typical China quality control.
4,"Good enough, but coulda been better.","I have read the first two books in the series, and I feel that this, the third, could have been better. It started off slow, and took a bit to get exciting, especially with the construction of the Cave Hold, Jaxon's illness, and his romance with Sharra. I had a couple of complains while reading it, though. For instance, why did she keep stringing along Jaxom and Menolly as a couple in the beginning of the book? It seems so obvious to me that she (Menolly) was jealous and curious about Jaxom's sordid love life with Corana, and even coupled them on trip to the Southern cove on the search for D'ram. Then, in the middle, she changes the whole relationship with the introduction of Sharra for Jaxom, and Sebell for Menolly. Well! I resented Sharra for the rest of the book, and Sebell, too. But otherwise, she made great strides in the series, keeping up an excuse to keep dragonmen alive on Pern. My only beef is, which book is next?"
5,Favorite of First Three Pern Books,"I've read most of the PERN series years ago, and now am enjoying them again. I adore this particular one SO much and recommend it highly, even if you haven't read the first 2 in the series yet. RUTH rules!"
2,Average read,"I feel the story dragged. I was always waiting for something more. I read all 3 books in this series, and while there was good character development, not much happened in story."
2,Don't waste your time,"I can not imagine why anyone would ever say that this book had much redeeming. NOTHING happened. When I mean NOTHING I mean NOTHING. I have no idea how an author can fill as many pages with nothing actually happening. There is no fantasy, there is just talking and a couple of interesting things that the dragons can do. I am amazed that the couple of the ""most helpful"" reviews have not been shot down. Obviously they were written by the publisher or others that have a vested interest. Their description is nothing like the book. If you don't believe me, please read the book and let me know what you think. I am frustrated and upset that this would actually be published. I imagine that the writing is pleasant enough, but for goodness sake, at least have a plot, an antagonist, some sort of climax. Please do not wast your time on this."
2,"PLease, think before you buy","I just finished reading this book, and though I admit I couldn't stop reading it, I thought this must have been one of the most boring books I have ever read. It seemed that the whole book was just about nothing but character development and politics. There is VERY little action, and I still can't see what the real climax in the story is. There wasn't very much to grip you, and the language is hard to understand if you haven't read the other books in the series. It was very descriptive, but that is not enough to make a good book. if you like predictability and politics, then go ahead and get this book. Otherwise, save yourself the trouble and get a different book."
2,"great ideas, horrible writing","Anne McCaffrey has interesting ideas in her books. This book included.The problem is her delivery. Her writing is not very readable. She creates too much visual noise with all the apostrophes. Sometimes she simply bores the reader. When she gets to good points, she changes the subject.If you are looking for a great book to read on an airplane, or to just pass the time, this is NOT the book. It's not gripping enough. However, if you need a way to torment yourself to relieve some guilt, this might be the book your looking for. Or, if you want to test your endurance, I can recommend it. Despite being a relatively short book, it seems like the book takes forever when you read it."
5,This is the Best Book ever!,It is my favorite of Anne McCAffrey's books. It's about this boy who saves the life of this little white dragon and Impresses it. They both have a hard time after that but everything turns out all right in the end.
3,Why You Didn't Call Me Back??? (Rating: 7 out of 10- -3.5 stars),"My mom got this single for me back around '94/'95 when I was a kid. This is Father's CD single ""I Beeped You"" from his albumSex Is Law, released back in 1993 on Uptown/MCA Records. Some of his lyrics are okay, but nothing too special. The two remixes on this album have different beats and a few modifications (like saying ""I got my mind on my money, and my money on my mind"" in the hooks), which were okay as well. All tracks produced by DJ Eddie F. Nothing too special with this single, but it's worth a listen. Peace!Lyrics: BProduction: BGuest Appearances: N/AMusical Vibes: B-Track Listing:1. Album Version (4:15)2. Who Beeped Me? Mix (3:48)3. Leave Me Alone Mix (3:40)4. Instrumental (4:08)"
5,"Marry Me, Suzi Parker","I bought this book on a whim on my way out of town, and couldn't put it down. Read it all in one day/night. Parker's voice is hysterical, and I seriously laughed until my ribs were sore. My wife and I agree--Sex in the South is the funniest book we've read in a long time.It's not porn or anything, but it's a brutally funny look at how people act down there in the South when it comes to sex. Parker goes through the South interviewing people about their weird/unusual sex habits. Example: she goes undercover and infiltrates a bondage scene (complete with senior citizens) in Alabama. The resulting scene is not what I normally think of when it comes to S&M;, but it's funny funny funny.I'm going to have to find out where Suzi Parker is signing books--how else can I propose?"
5,A Must-Have,"Being a Little Rock native, I had heard of 'The Book' from the time it first came out. I recently attended a reading by Ms. Parker and I laughed until I cried at some of the passages. From a man-horse named Trigger to the steamy S&M club, Ms. Parker went there and did that (or at least watched) to find out what's really going on behind closed doors in the prim and proper Deep South."
3,Get the book,"This no review just a note.I am from Louisiana and by chance picked up the book.Boy, did I ever find myself and some of my friends from the South in this all-inclusive sample of truth focused on the South.If you have been wondering what's been going on behind closed and open doors in the south then stop looking at the faces of those around you and go with Suzi Parker behind the curtain and see for yourself what is simmering there.You will see the South thru Miss Parkers unadulterated eyes and boy, will you enjoy the viewing.She sees thru blunt HUMOR and honest eyes!!!!!YOU HAVE GOT TO READ THIS BOOK!!!!!"
3,"A little objectivity, please!","The author's prim and proper approach to anything other than the missionary position ruined this book for me. She spends too much time trying to reassure the reader that the ""kinks"" she explores for purposes of the book do not turn her on in the least, are far too freaky for her, etc. Me thinks the lady doth protest too much. If you want to read about unusual sex by an open minded and cool writer, pick up one of Tristan Taormino's books instead."
3,Pop!,"The baloons pop while you are pumping them and it is really annoying. The balloons can make some really cute animals, but you run out of balloons really fast."
2,Pop goes the Poodle (and every other animal),I purchased this kit to discover that the manual is poorly designed and of low quality and the balloons are poor quality (half broke before the first twist either from inflation or when tying the knot). Fortunately I was able to get a few dogs created and some swords (based on instructions from the internet and not the included manual). Overall a big disappointment.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"I'm so disappointed in this product. I had purchased this for my daughter who was interested in making balloon animals! The pump didn't work, the balloons did not hold the air and they would break very easily. I'm returning this item ASAP!! VERY CHEAPLY MADE..."
4,"Liked it so much, all of the grandkids got it for XMas",The grand kids are all thrilled to be able to make their own balloon animals.The pump makes it very easy to blow up those long skinny balloons.Easy to follow instructions.My only complaint would be I would like to have seen more variations on the styles in the instructions.All of them are a variation on a basic dog.
3,I'd have to disagree,"I feel the other reviewers are being a bit too generous. There are a few nice, large, illustrations in this book but most aren't big enough. The ratio of text to illustrations is a lot greater than I expected or desired. That may or may not be an issue for you, depending on your wants or needs. I'm more interesting in seeing and studying the works than I am about the history, background, or motivations of the artists and movements.If your desire is a variety of large, detailed, quality color illustrations to study then you should search elsewhere. If you can live with a mix of B&W; and color images of varying size and detail, and you like to read, then this book may very well be to your liking."
5,A Very Important Art Book,"Christopher Wood has done it again. No serious lover of art should be without this book, which contains many clear large images and well-written text.It is a great companion of Lionel Lambourne's ""Victorian Painting"". They do NOT overlap each other but seems to work together filling in the gaps where one left off. If you love beautiful art, get them both, you wouldn't be disappointed. I wish there could be a lot more of books like these around."
3,Pretty good,"The slipcover is enormous and must be ironed, obviously, before putting on the couch. It is not super easy to put on, but once it is on and tucked correctly it looks nice. Overall, for the price, we are glad we got it!"
4,Slip Covers,I have enjoyed the slipcover it fits well over the sofa and can be washed in the washing mashine and dried in the dryer.
1,WORST COMPANY AND CUSTOMER SERVICE,"The slipcover burned on the lowest iron setting (per THEIR directions) and they refused to credit me. They are RUDE and on top of it, when I returned both slipcovers, it took them over a MONTH to credit me for the undamaged cover, which they wouldn't have done if I didn't call to tell them. They said it was an ""oversight"". Do NOT buy these cheap products!!!"
1,Awful purchase,"After I put it on my couch, I sat down and it ripped in the corner. I didn't even bother sending it back b/c I had no vehicle at the time and didn't want to deal with the hassle of having to walk all the way to the post while pregnant."
4,Grat but...,i loved the art. i love the idea of the female crow but i did not like the fact that she called herself a zombie.and the fact that she did not heal like the other crows but other than that the story was good. must have for a die hard fan
5,going back to the past!,"Hi and, if you haven't bought this doble cd yet, what are you waiting for?As i listen to these beautiful songs again, i go back to where beautiful times i lived! I thought i was never going to be able to find these songs that i had in my head but, i was wrong.Thanks to the new technology and thanks to places like Amazon, we are able to find these treasures who seemed to be lost for everer! When you listen songs like(Un Pueblo es, N'a veirina do mar, Canta Cigarra, El Cantor, etc), you go back to where Music, words and voice, used to go togheter to create a wonderful world of art!I hope you buy this pack so you too, can go back and enjoy again those beautiful moments which we thoght were lost."
3,Awkward at times,"the flow of the book is a bit troubling, as they, the characters seem to be bumbling along, they also seem to overcome impossible odds, i love fantasy, but the odds of them defeating some of the things they overcome isnt very likely.the plot does seem to redeem itself with a few twists on character roles, but somehow i feel as though these were due to the authors styles, and ideas on the plot going back and forth, and makes this a ad-lib transcript they worked out for enjoyment."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"I just could not get into this book, and I tried a couple of times. The setup is certainly something I would often enjoy, with the coming of a supernatural world overtaking modern technology, which fades. However, this is not a patch on Mark Chadbourn's take on a similar story, for example."
2,Deluxe? I think not.,"This is very poorly made. I wanted to get one from Amazon rather than one of the other merchants that sells through the website. They only had 6 choices, and I was liked that it folded so I chose this one.The holes are not completely drilled. The pegs do not fit properly into the recessed area that is supposed to hold them. The plastic cover for the peg compartment is very difficult to move. Even the card deck is slightly smaller than usual, but that doesn't really bother me since we have plenty of card decks. It is the shoddy construction of the board itself that is a disappointment. It was inexpensive, but it isn't worth anywhere near the price. It is more like something that you would find at one of the dollar or less stores.Cribbage itself is an excellent game, and a board makes a convenient way to keep track, but if you are looking at cribbage boards, you probably already know that."
2,Rusted!,"I found my overall experience with this spider to be less than so-so. I ended up tossing it in the recycling bin. Why, you might ask? Well here are the reasons:1. Nickel plated? That's fine for my pocket change, but I'm not sure I want that in my cooking utensils. Why the heck are they allowing this toxic (albeit in varying degrees) for cooking purposes?!2. It's not solid stainless steel.3. The edges are kind of jagged and rough. Those with softer skin may find issue with this.4. It rusts!!For your health, pass on the Typhoon and find a better quality skimmer."
2,Nice design. Poor quality. Poor craftsmanship.,Despite hand washing as recommended one weld attaching the handle to basket rusted and broke after only a few uses. Closer inspection revealed the handle was only welded to the thin mesh of the basket and not to the thick outer ring! Lesson learned: Beware Cook's Illustrated recommendations!
5,"Insightful, practical, easy to understand & apply.","Wonderful bible-based advice for the unequally yolked wife. It gives lots of examples of the issues these wives face & how best they handled them. Offers instructions, relief & hope for women who find themselves in this challenging relationship."
2,Discouraging,"I just finished reading Beloved Unbeliver by Jo Berry. In all honesty, that book is well written but the message is depressing and discouraging. I am a born again believer and my husband is not a Christian. After reading this book I felt like a huge burden was placed upon me -- Jo focused a lot on ""works"".. that is what a wife should do and not do. Instead of feeling encouraged I felt so heavy and burdened down. It was one huge list of do do do do ..... she gave so many ""do's"" but not a lot of constructive ""how to"" and very little focus on how God's grace will help the christian wife to live for Christ and be a witness. A very depressing read.I would not recommend this book at all for Christian women. This book is a definate guilt trip.Just my .02,"
5,Not Just For The Unequally Yoked!,"This is such a wonderful book. While the main focus is directed to Christian women married to unbelieving men, all women can learn something from it - married or single. I myself am not married, but I couldn't put the book down once I started reading. There are excerpts from interviews with people so you get a taste of ""real life"" situations, there are many Biblical referneces, and there are workshops at the end of each chapter. If you're a wife or ever plan on becoming one, this is a book of guidelines on what you are to be to your husband. I'm already reading it a second time. I'd definitely recommend it."
1,I PUT IT DOWN AGAIN AND AGAIN,THIS BOOK COULDN'T KEEP THE ATTENTION OF THE MOST PATIENT READER! NOT ONLY WERE THE CHARACTERS DULL BUT THE STORYLINE WAS PREDICTABLE. IT WAS LIKE WAITING FOR THE LAST SHOE TO DROP.
3,ok if you are a great reader,"This book had all of the terms I needed for my volunteer trip to China, but there is no pinyin so using the chinese side was tedious."
2,Recommend a different book - hard to read and cheap,"Maybe this book is supposed to be kind of cheap and hard to read. It is all black and gray (even the cover). Weird font and it is all kind of mashed together - there is no bold words or anything like that. It is hard to tell where poems begin. Also the page numbers are not even close to what it says in the index. For example, page ""48"" in the index is actually ""73"" in the book.Very poor quality book - worst I have ever had probably. Bummer."
4,classic and real,"With all the glossy, ready-made country flim on the radio these days, some listeners may be yearing for some of the real thing. If so, pick up this older cd by the Mavericks. Raul Malo (lead singer) has an amazing voice, almost haunting, and the band seems to build songs around it. The whole thing grabs you from the start and will keep you mesmerized until the end. Although some of their newer albums lacked the punch of this one, you should still check them out. Word."
4,Worth buying,"This album will not disappoint die-hard country-rock fans who believe that ""they don't make 'em like they used to."" Lead singer Raul Malo has a sweet tenor voice that makes the comparisons to Roy Orbison justifiable. Several songs stand out, including the title track, ""I Should Have Been True,"" and the Springsteen cover. This album also serves notice to the Nashville scene that country music need not be reduced to formula to be marketable."
5,One of the best albums ever,"I bought this album a few years ago. It immediately became one of my favorites and it remains so today. Beautifully written songs in the classic country tradition, with lines like ""Here come the blues, there goes my heart."" I am a guitar player, so the quality of the guitar work on an album is critical to me. This album features great sounding guitars and tasteful playing, not flashy but clearly the product of a very skilled player. Add to this the right amount of fiddle, pedal steel and honky-tonk piano, plus Raul Malo's absolutely fabulous voice, and you get one of my favorite albums of all time."
4,Raul Malo has one of the best voices EVER!,"It is clear that after From Hell To Paradise these boys wanted to try to get on the radio. Not a bad thing if you don't sell out, and with this album they made the transition perfectly. What A Cryin' Shame is the first song I ever heard by them. When it came on the radio, my dad and I would call each other so we could be sure to turn on the radio and hear it. I had to buy everything they had to put out, which wasn't much at the time, but I have also been collecting ever since. It's ashame the radio won't play as much of their later, more experimental stuff."
3,Product Review,"This movie would be much better if it had been digitally enhanced. It looks about as bad as an old tape. Even some of the sound is hard to make out. Except for this, I liked the movie. I am a willaim Smith/Peter Brown fan and they're both in it, but it would have been nice to see it better. There is a good motorcycle race and lots of outdoor footage."
2,Just one freaking piranha in the entire movie,"The original title of this movie consisted of just the one word: Piranha. And that's all you see of piranhas. Just one. And that's the opening credits. So, one star for being accurately titled. I give one more star for William Smith's perfect enunciation of the word ""australopithecine.""Not bad enough to be good, but some potential for mashups and mixing."
1,Bought it by mistake,"I bought this movie thinking it was the cult classic Piranha. After I realized it wasn't, I figured I'd watch it anyway since I am a fan old movies. It sucked. Bad acting and the camera work was horrifing. Dont buy this unless you know for sure what you are getting. Ill not make that mistake twice."
1,NO PIRANHA,"**Plot Spoiler review** (If possible)The movie shows you a close-up of a piranha that is out of water with ominous music. A lone piranha, out of water, is not very scary. Some Americans go to Venezuela for a camera safari in the jungle. From the way they are talking I expected to see dinosaurs, but from the title...piranha (and we see neither). Ahna Capri, the female babe on the trip is against guns (Warning a pro-gun film slapping in the face of liberals.). While in the jungle she gets raped (both are fully clothed) and changes her mind...movie over. There are some filler scenery scenes, some of which where noticeably shot with a different camera in another location. No bad language, no sex, no nudity, and no piranha. You're better off with an Asylum film you have already seen and hated. Okay, so I spoiled the plot for you and SAVED YOU 90 MINUTES OF YOUR LIFE.You're Welcome."
1,Not What I Expected,"The advertisement stated this is a 2005 movie. When I received it, it was a 73' movie only remastered in 2005. This movie is awful. Saw only 2 minutes of it and turned it off. Now I'm trying to get rid of it. What a waste. It doesn't even deserve a rating."
1,Nasty Garbage!,"Despite having the great villainous William Smith, the film was garbage and the transfer is disgusting."
4,GOOD BASIC OVERVIEW OF DESIGNS,"THIS BOOK OFFERS A GOOD, SIMPLE OVERVIEW OF THE PICTORIAL CATEGORIES OF EARLY AND MODERN STEAMSHIP DESIGNS. THE READER SHOULD NOT CONFUSE THE TITLE WITH STEAMBOATS. THIS BOOK IS FOCUSED MORE ON BRITISH, COMMERCIAL SHIPS AND NOT AMERICAN LINES. SINCE STEAMSHIPS EVOLVED OVER THE YEARS (DUE TO ENGINE AND TURBINE DESIGN IMPROVEMENTS), THE BOOK HELPS READERS SEE THE EVOLUTIONARY CHANGES. THE ONLY NEGATIVE THOUGHT INVOLVES THE USE OF THE TERM ""COMPLETE"" IN THE TITLE. IT COULD DISAPPOINT READERS EXPECTING TO SEE A MORE DEFINITIVE AND CATEGORICAL LISTING OF VESSELS."
1,"""Remastered version"" my @ss! AVOID!","RE: the other 'review' - isn't it nice to read a panned review of the movie, and not be informed regarding the abysmal quality of this version???Yet one MORE lousy pressing of a classic for which a GOOD quality pressing seems to continually avoid being distributed.Not only will you have to play with the zoom function to get this absolutely lousy picture quality DVD to display on your wide aspect monitor, but you will then be able to wonder just why you bothered, as the resolution of the picture is absolutely atrocious.The closest this pressing has come to being remastered was in the transfer from a VHS tape to DVD.AVOID! With luck we may get a decent transfer to digital within our lifetimes! ...Which begs the question of why Amazon continues to add still more versions of the same lousy pressing rather than simply one quality transfer..."
1,Didn't work.,"Bought this early before Christmas, and did not open when recieved. Wish that I had opened it bc it is off by approximately 10 degrees. Taylor is usually a good product, so was rather surprised when it did not work."
4,TAYLOR THERMOMETER,"I had a Taylor thermometer before, but it started being off about 20 degrees. (it was only about 10 years old...,just being sarcastic) That is why it order a new Taylor. If it lasts close to 10 years I'll be happy. Love the colors."
1,"13"" color dial thermometer","I think the thermometer looks nice and is very lightweight for easy hanging. However, I do not feel like it gives accurate temperature readings at all. I have it on a wall that gets morning sun outside but even when the sun is not directly on it, the temperature reads way higher than it actually is. It's only use at this point is for decoration."
1,Does not work below 40 degrees!!! do not buy!!!!,The lowest temperature this item will read is 40 degrees. if its 28 it says 40. if 33 it says 40. do not buy this item if you have temps below 40 degrees.
4,Nearly A Great Book,"Mysteries are mysteries except when written by Hill. His novels are wonderfully written works of fiction that use the murder mystery genre merely as the tread. It is the ""getting there"" that he masters so well.It was great to see the characters from his previous book, 'Dialogues of the Dead' show up again in this novel - part two... but 'Dialogues of the Dead' is the one to own."
1,garbage,Reading this book is a complete waste of time. This is sad because Hill used to write extremely well.
4,Songs missing,"This is the ""Blonde On Blonde"" of West Texas. It includes some of Hancock's finest material, like the terrific title track, ""Row of Dominoes"", ""Smokin' In The Rain"", ""Personal Rendition Of The Blues"" and ""Wild Horses Chase The Wind"". I would only like to make you aware of the fact that for this cd release two tracks have been omitted - a second, acoustic version of the title track, and the long and wonderful talkin' blues song ""Split and Slide"". There is no information about these omissions on the record and that always irritates me. I know this because I was lucky enough to stumble across the extremely hard-to-find original vinyl Double-Lp at a record fair. (At an incredibly low price....)"
2,Not a great slide and one safety hazard,"My husband and I got this at BJs and we brought it back the next day. I agree that the slide was like a sticky vinyl and my son had trouble on it. But the biggest concern was the climbing wall to the slide located behind the slide. It is pretty high up and while there is a small landing cushion it is not enough to cover a fall from the top of the slide or the climbing wall. I know that is not very likely but both my husband and I agreed it was not worth the risk!! (look at the picture of the girl on the slide and imagine she tips backwards - there is nothing of substance there to catch her). We chose a model with a ""back."""
3,"fun toy, easy to break","This has been a great help in moving files back and forth between computers. The compatibility between Macs and PCs is great and it was plug and play from the beginning.However, there are lots of these drives on the market, and I've decided to buy a second one - with more memory and better construction. Through normal use, the blue part of my Micro Vault is now separated from the bottom, and comes off every time I try to remove the top. This leaves the insides exposed, and I'm sure that can't be so good.I'll send it back to sony (once I have a replacement, because it has become an invaluable tool), and hopefully they can correct the problem."
1,Complete waste of money.,I purchased this flash drive about 6 months ago. This device is a total piece of trash. The plastic cover is very fragile and the one I have cracked at first and then it broken in pieces. Do not buy this drive it you need a durable item.
3,Same old Stuff,"I really liked his book "" You Can Do It "" so I thought I'd readhis other books but I found that "" Impossible is Possible "" islike reading the same thing over. Nothing New. In fact, onepage I really kept for myself was exactly the same in bothbooks. So, you'll come to say, "" Didn't I read this before?""Disappointing that he did pretty much the same thing butcalled them different titles."
1,horrible,this book is so bad I feel the author STOLE my money when he published it and advertised it the way he didThere is NO content here. NOTHING new. NO program.All there is is a bunch of quotes on various subjectsyou can do better for free onlineDO NOT buy this book
1,DON'T BUY THIS,"Beware!! This album lists a good line up of songs, BUT, they are NOT recordings of the original artists! Sounds like really bad karaoke!! Really, Really Bad!!!"
4,A very nice cartridge!,"We have the original Mozart, Rhythms of the World, and Sounds of the Orchestra in addition to this one. I like Mozart and Bach the best.For those interested, the Bach tune is BWV 784 Two Part Invention #13 in A minor."
3,Down till the real climb,Hi! My name is Rachel and I am from Rhode Island and I am a young reader. I thought over all the book was ok through the first 100 pages. But as i approched the chapter called the STORM I then just sparked because the book got so much funner[ can not tell u y cause it will give it away. I really love this book because it shows that any ordanary person can go out into the real world and fo-fill their dream. I rate this a three because of the beginning of the book is really boring
3,An Inspiring Story,"Greetings: I am a young reader and I found this book to be exceptional. This book is about mental strength as well as physical strength. Mark's views are interesting. In my opinion, the book is fine until the chapter entitled ""The Storm."" I've read about the storm before and I think he could have described Everest '96 a lot better. If you like reading about Everest I recommend ""Into Thin Air"" by Jon Krakauer."
3,Within Reach - book review,"This was a good book, but it didn't ever really pull me in, my mind drifted a lot. If this book would have been more capturing I would have enjoyed it more.The Author started climbing when he was 12, and he loved it. He snuck into a rock gym even though he was underage, and was soon on his way to Everest. Through sponsors, and a little help from his parents he made the money to travel to places all over the world, on trips with instructors and groups for 4 years until he made it to the top: Everest.This non-fiction story is very inspiring, and well written. Except for the fact that it doesn't have the magic that pulls you into the story; it is still a good book.I recommend this book to people who have patience in reading, and like a story that you can feel, like how it felt to be up there on Everest. That's what this book is like."
4,Within Reach reveiw,"Within Reach is a very good book. It explains how if you put your mind to something you can do it. Mark a teenager is in to rock climbing a lot, he is willing to stop school stop every thing around him to climb. Mark is the youngest person to climb certain mountains, he doesn't climb for the public he climb for him self. Mark kept a journal on his mountain climbs so you really know how he feels. If you like a book about a person that fights for what he believes for you have to read this book."
4,Mountain Adventure,"Within Reach is the story of a young man, Mark Pfetzer, and his amazing adventures as he struggles to complete his dream. Starting in the RI Rock Gym with Mark meeting Geoff Tabin, climber, Within Reach shows the good and bad of climbing. When Mark's dad gets sick, you really feel that something terrible is going to happen, and you just can't shake it off you. Within Reach is a story for all levels. It makes you feel as if Mark is confiding his greatest trust in you because it is written like his journal. It is written on such a personal basis that you feel like you have experienced Mark's triumphs and failures along with him. Over all, I would recommend this as an excellent non-fiction book."
4,"""Within Reach"" My Everest Story","""Within Reach"" is the true story of Mark Pfetzer and his dream of climbing Everest, starting in the RI Rock Gym. Quickly, he developed a passion for climbing of all sorts. His Passion took him all over the world, to the Kathmandu airport, where having your baggage stolen was routine, to Nepal, to the Himalayas, and eventually, Everest. This book ranks as one of my favorite non-fictional stories because it is very captivating and it is a huge inspiration, showing that even ordinary people can achieve great things if they set their minds to it. I think that Neal Beidleman sums up Everest best with his response to Mark's query about his running in 100-mile races. ""Yes, I do run them. And you know what? This [Everest] is harder."""
1,this book sucks,this is the worst excuse for a book that i have ever been forced to read. its hard to follow and stuff. it sucks.
4,It's a great book.,I have the book and it's very interesting. I really like the stuff about mountaian climbing and the mountains. I think it's cool that he's still in school and climbs Mt. Everest!
3,Within Reach : My Everest Story,"This was a great book from a teenager's perspective. This book is very inspiring to young children, teenagers, and kids who want to rock climb. I enjoyed this book because I love to rock climb. Mark expresses the way he feels about his life, problems, fears, and bumps in-between. He sets of to conquer his dream summiting Everest. But, will he summit?It starts at a 13 year-old kid with a dream. It ends with a 16 year-old trying to conquer it."
4,Within Reach,"Within Reach is a great book! Mark Pfetzer is a young mountain climber. But being young, he will have problems. He travels to many places. Finally he gets to Everest, but can he summit? He has gone to Ama Dablam and many other mountains to get this far. But on Everest the winds can blow you off the mountain. The altitude has air so thin that you think with reasoning of a five year old. The death zone on Everest lives up to its name. Will he and his team partners make it? Or will he try again? Or worst, die on the mountains?"
3,This CD is ok. But I still love Ha-Ash!!,I waited so long for their new cd to come out. I wasn't that impressed. I think their first cd is a lot better. This cd sounds so country it's crazy. I know the girls are into that but I just thought this cd would have been better than the first.There are a lot of songs on here that are great don't get me wrong...but if you are a Ha-Ash fan get it!!Sad
3,Vadim has a vision...,"Vadim walked a very thin line at a time when it was very unconventional to, 'push the envelope' as one might say.But, push the envelope hi did, and he erased the line with his cinematic genius and lust for life, which he brought to the screen as no one had ever dared to do before.All progress was made by those of us who dared to be different.And Dare...Vadim did.This particular movie was beautifully erotic and artistic. If you are a student of cinema, Vadim will give you a fellowship on the artistry of filming."
3,Impossible for me to rate,"In the almost impossible event that anyone is as technologically ignorant as I am, please be aware that when something is (Blue-Ray) that means it wont play on a regular DVD player. I thought it was a special addition for those that have a blu-ray player. I know, I know, totally out of touch, dumber than dumb. Anyway, It was my birthday present to myself and its the first time its cost me money not to get a present BUT it looks really good and I still want one like it someday."
2,Horrible DVD or Maybe its amazon.com,"I was surprised to see the quality of the tank unfortunately the sound does not work.. I don't know if this is some kind of sick joke, a reflection of amazon.com's service or a reflection of future complications and screw up's from Toshiba. Its not my sound every other HDdvd and/or dvd I have works except this one, I have optical and digital hook up i've ruled my equipment out."
1,disappointed,"This does not look very ""high def"" and certainly not filmed at 1080p. Also, with all that room on a B-ray disc, you think they could make the segments longer than a few minutes; what happened, did the fishy's union demand overtime or something? It's not like there is huge overhead filming a tank of fish with a stationary camera. Waste of money."
1,don't buy this,"waste of time,effort and money....waiting for a true 1080 high definition of this kind....it also jumps from one since to the other....very very bad product...i'm sorry amazon but this is not a good buy."
3,HD Aquarium,"I found this to be beautiful, but the menus don't work very well. In a regular DVD player, I could see which aquarium or music I was choosing, only after several button pushes. In an HD DVD player, I could never tell which choice I was navigating to. It is frustrating. It is not worth the price. At $12.00 I would have felt good about it."
3,HDScape Exotic Saltwater Aquarium,"The quality of the DVD is great however the menus are horrible. When navigating, the menu items do not highlight. You have no way of knowing what you have selected other than guessing."
4,Absolutely stunning!,"This is, by far, one of the best virtual aquarium DVDs on the market. The selection of tanks is very good (though I would have liked to see one or two freshwater aquariums as well). Unfortunately, as others have mentioned, it's practically impossible to navigate through the title menu since there's nothing indicating what you're selecting (using HD-DVD player w/Xbox 360). Hopefully this is something that will be fixed in future releases.If you can get over that frustrating oversight, though, you're going to absolutely LOVE this disk."
4,More Sea Creatures,"This is another Blu-ray DVD of sea creatures doing their thing while a pleasent musical score plays. The photography is excellant, and it is very peacefull to watch."
1,Bad DVD,"Unfortunately, this DVD failed twice and I had to return each order.Do you have a similar more reliable recommendation for a HD-DVD screen saver?"
4,so it is....,"It is what it says. I can't think of too many situations that it would be used, but the kids do love it :)"
3,Not great,"Probably the most boring fish tank I have seen but not terrible. I bought it to keep the cats entertained. The color isn't bright and the fish aren't colorful, they hand painted some of the color in."
3,Not too bad...,"Not the best HD material I've seen, but some of it's not too bad. There is a huge difference between the 480p side and the 1080p side. My favorite is the coral reef, as it has the best image.My main goal for this disc is not to show off my system, for which I have other, better suited titles for, but rather to play in the background during parties, and for that, it's does a great job and is very pleasing.Yes, the menus are very slow and brutally simple, but they get the job done. If they don't work for you, then you might need to update the firmware in your player.I think it was worth the 16 clams. (Pun intended ;)Equipment:Panasonic 50"" plasma (50PZ750U, recently calibrated by a highly regarded ISF professional)Toshiba A20 HD DVD playerOnkyo TX-SR705 receiver, using HDMI"
3,Old Bluray,"I really expected it to be like looking at a tank live? It wasn't, my new Vizio 55"" looks great but this dvd was a downer.."
3,"Great visuals, broken menus","As commented on by others, the menus do not highlight and therefore it's nearly impossible to select the option (aquarium, music) that you want. I can't believe this actually shipped: it's like beta software that should have been fixed before release.That having been said, the visuals are truly HD and are fabulous, and look great on my 50"" plasma HDTV. If not, I would have returned this to Amazon for a refund. I will certainly not buy any further HDScape titles unless there is ample evidence that the menu problem has been fixed."
4,Almost as good as having your own tank,"I like this product quite a bit, and I think it makes a great ""calibration disk"" for you display, since you know exactly what most of these fish should look like. IMHO, I have to stand about 8ft. away from my 32"" Sony Bravia before I am truly fooled into thinking i am looking at an actual tank."
3,"Works, but was a little dim",Replacing a bulb never seems as good as the original. This bulb didn't last nearly as long as the first but did the job until I was able to purchase a new one.
4,Truly a work of art in the action-espionage genre,This book picks you up and doesn't want to put you down. From the very beginnning my palms were sweating and my forehead was hot. I couldn't wait to turn the page to see what was going to happen next. Mister Bond you still have not lost your touch. Great new plot with lots of new ideas and circumstances revolving around everyones favorite spy
2,Complete madness,"What is up with this book? Did John Gardner just get tired of writing it and decide to slap together that last two thirds of it. Here we have the 'rise' of the 4th Reich (again) and a zillionaire whacko (again) who wants to take over the world (again.) I am still trying to figure out how oil spills are connected with world domination, but that's just me. John Gardner was clearly getting sick of Bond with this book, and he would only have one more to go. Thank goodness, though it only gets worse with new Bond author Raymond Benson, whose books are so cartoonish and amateurish they make the James Bond Jr. cartoon seem like vintage Fleming."
3,ANOTHER GREAT TITLE FROM GARDNER,John Gardner comes through with another great title and another poorly written novel. He is very consistent however! His novel still reads like a movie script and his ability to enthrall the reader still remains lacking. One highlight: this paperback has a great cover! I think it is time that these entries get put to Sea.
1,"Liberal, Communist spy","The liberal media praising a communist? Color me shocked.Woody Guthrie is an abomination. His songs are full of dangerous communist ideas. He was the inspiration of the 60s counter-culture.I'll stick to my Toby Keith, you can stick to your Commie music."
2,Viola's Hammer,This was an interesting book of many plots and a murder mystery. This author always has a lot of sic sex involved in all of his books. Disappointing.
5,monkey around,I like this product a lot. It show really raftmen shittttt. Yall digg me. Monkey are the shit and i pour hennesy in this
3,pretty good,"Got these, plugged them in and they charge your batteries, comes in a 2 pack, each with 2 batteries, so the cost is less than 4 batts by themselves.Con: the lights never go out telling you when the batts are fully charged."
2,Amy Beach,"This recording just didn't do it for me, I found it lacking emotion and focus. I don't recomment this CD for any serious listening."
4,Very listenable,"This is a very listenable cd featuring Amy Beach's Violin sonata. Her music is very soothing. It is great to listen to while reading, you are seeking relaxation or would like some soft background music."
4,This was a great book!,"I read ""Molly By Any Other Name"", when I was about 14,that was a few years ago, but i still remember that I really enjoyed this book. I could really relate to the main character Molly. If you are interested in adoption or if you are adopted yourself I think you will enjoy reading this book. Although I think the age range for this book is around 12-17 I think a lot of people would benif from reading it even if you are a bit older. People of all ages will appreciate the message that is being demonstrated. I also love the poem that Jean Davis Okimoto wrote, it was very sweet. I recomend you read this book!!"
1,Should have been a car commerical.,Not worth the time or money . Forget renting not worth it and defintly do not buy.A real disappointment. A bust
1,Trash!!,I saw this same bad dvd under another name.Cheaply shot & some side story with a goof ball brother running around in wig with false teeth.Don't waste your money!!!
2,"not the best, but ok.","Kind of a let down... but was ok. not the best made movie, but good info on beach week. Need more Hot girls like the one on the cover."
1,Disappointed,"Purchased this for a halloween costume. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed when it arrived. The powder from inside the cigar was all over the inside of the packaging and all over the cigar. I do NOT want to put that thing anywhere near my mouth. It also didn't look very good, even if you discount all the extra powder.It's definitely cheap (in a good way), and other people may find it useful, but for me it was a complete failure."
2,Seen Better @ Dollar Tree,"Although it shipped quick and arrived in good condition, it only ""puffed"" smoke for a minute or two, then stopped, and got soggy from be blowing in it, (it's only cardboard with a cotton ball inside.) I've seen better at the dollar tree. For a one night costume, I recomend, otherwise, I don't.Sincerly,Darrah R. Bortnick"
3,Your kidding me?,"This is does not look at ALL like a cigar it looks like a cardboard tube with red tin foil at the tip and a cheap ""Puff Cigar"" sticker on i advise do NOT buy this even though theres more 5 and 4 stars this review will prob be the most truthful"
3,This is NOT a toy. Ordered/Used as accessory for Adult Halloween Costume. Exactly what I wanted/ordered/expected.,This is NOT a toy. This was purchased/used as a costume accessory for an adult.
5,Awesome product,"My friend used this on Halloween when he dressed up as a Mafia dude. It was really cool! It actually fooled me, and I thought he was smoking. It was a freakin good thing he was not. Anyway this is really cool and next year for Halloween I'm gonna get this as well as one of those Ostrich Rider Illusion costumes. 'Later...PS: This item will also go great with a cowboy costume or maybe an April Fool's Day prank. Or just go all out and be a smokin' Elmo for God's sake."
2,Kind of gross,"This fake cigar is kind of gross. It gets soggy rather quickly, so it's not good for a costume, as it tastes and feels disgusting to keep in your mouth. The fake ""puff"" function is just some dust that flies out of the ""lit"" end of the cigar if you blow into it. Not a good thing. Find another prop."
1,Really fake,I ordered this item for part of a prank. However I didn't end up using it as looks really fake. Also it only gives a couple puffs of smoke.
4,Kindle Edition Notes,"A few notes for the Kindle edition of this book: No real problems with the text, but all footnote annotations within the body of the book are lost, i.e. footnotes still exist at the book's end but there are no links to them. Reading footnotes out of context is meaningless, and source references are not useful in this way. Most pictures come through fine with good resolution, save for a map and a chart which are too finely drawn for the Kindle screen. Not a big deal, I know the geography anyway. I suppose the latter problem cannot be helped but the footnote issue should be fixable with more careful or advanced scanning of the text. Kindle ed. price was right, and a pleasure to read this book quickly turning pages with the convenient buttons, etc. 4-5 stars for the book, 3 for the format translation."
3,Ghost Ship,The research was a A+ job. I was disapointed though when they hardly researched the remains of the wreckage when found. I was really hoping to hear more detail on what the divers seen and did. Maybe some unwater photographs of the wreck.
4,A Real Preacher's KId,This is more like it -- the realistic story of a preacher's kid and it's funny and sad and full of life's experiences as he goes through the rites of passage into young adulthood.
5,Book 2 of the series,"Good coming of age story, with a christian theme. Hard to find a good book anymore that does not resort to foul language and sex just to keep you interested. I would recommend this book to anybody, especially PK's, and those married to PK's. I rated this book as a 5 star book, because I read the series in a weekend. Found only one or two minor technical errors, and thoroughly enjoyed the read. I would also recommend it to book clubs, as it has some very good issues to discuss."
5,A Perfect Sequel,"Sequels are rarely as good as their predecessors. This sequel is even better than the first book, Welcome to Fred. And WTF was great. This one has more laughs, more heart, more insight - I couldn't put it down. They say a good writer gets the reader so engrossed that he doesn't even know he's reading. This is that book."
2,Fragile and Overpriced,"I've used both the 64MB and 128MB version. The Sony Micro Vault is way overpriced in comparision to its competetion. I can get twice the storage capacity on a San Disk Mini Cruzer for the same price. The Mini Cruzer is built a lot better too. The Micro Vault has a cheap plastic case and everyone I've use has eventually pulled apart exposing the board inside. This is the only drive I've had do this. Its just crappy design, trying to make it look cool at the cost of durability. It isn't the most compatible drive either. Works fine in XP but on every 98 or ME system I've used it on driver installation has been hell, requiring multiple reboots to make the machine detect it. The Mini Cruzer has been an easy install on older OS for me.Overall it does what its suppose to but there are far more reliable, far cheaper, far more compatible and far more durable drives out there."
1,DO NOT BUY THE MICRO VAULT PRODUCT!,THIS IS A HORRIBLE DEVICE. IT IS NOT USB 2.0 COMPLIANT. IT IS VERY VERY SLOW. I TRIED EVERYTHING!...NUFF SAID!!!
5,A real chiller,"Long before DaVinci Code, Turn of the Screw was generating all sorts of controversy. Are the ghosts genuine or a product of neurosis? Who sees them? Just what is going on with the young master, and is he actually perpetrating all the terror? Then there are readers who dislike James's style. For me, these and other questions enhance my enjoyment of this essentially timeless story. James's elegant language merely adds another layer to the deliciously creepy atmosphere. The Turn of the Screw is fun to read and enjoy as a ghost story, pure and simple. For double the fun, check out the DVD. Just don't watch it alone!"
5,Something different!,"This leather sandal is cute, comfy, and you can wear it with anything! Skirt, pants, capris, and even jeans will look good with this sandal. I was very pleased with my purchase. They run true to size."
1,rip off,This book is barely worth the time reading it. It's advise is superficially presented and written in a very shallow way. I regret buying it for my teenager and cannot ethically recommend it.
2,not thrilled,"tried using it....thought it would be okay with the UV light I also got....never ""cured"" under the UV light/fan....even after 4 minutes...must be doing something wrong or not!....feels like i wasted my money"
4,Travel? Mystery? SciFi? Take your pick...,"A great read to stash away in your backpack alongside your Loney Planet guidebook. A short, face-paced thriller of a slacker whose life suddenly gets turned inside out as he finds himself in exotic locales with unforseen dangers at every turn. Leaves you waiting for the next one in what one hopes may be a series."
3,Disappointed,"U30 has stylish design, feels small, lots of good accessories like cool cases, bundled NiMH batteries/charger, afforable price and good build quality.Sony didn't make much changes to DSCU20 from last year. It still have no viewfinder for use in sunlight & outdoors, tiny LCD, no video out (really really imp for slideshows on TV), no optical zoom, featureless and thicker than Elph's.In short if you want stylish pocket camera without spending a lot and don't mind paying the memory stick tax, DSCU30 is great. If you are serious about image quality and want a good primary camera, then there are many better models."
5,Nita,The piece was used on our boat .. it was exactly what I was looking for .. it worked perfectly .. Thanks
3,"Older women, take note!","This is an interesting take on older women's attitudes and roles in society today. One does not like to think of themself as a 'crone' but with the author's definition, we can consider ourselves in a different light and take our position lightly. I bought 3 copies for gifts as my friend gave me a copy for my birthday."
4,enjoy being a crone,i turned 51 this year and was feeling invisible alongside the beautiful young things. i felt my allure had vanished and i was no good for anything but the retirement home. bolen's work promotes a sense of beauty that can live in the older woman. reading her 13 lessons shines a light into a new world of possibilities and one i'm looking forward to! i am a juicy crone!
3,Crones don't whine,"Crones Don't Whine: Concentrated Wisdom for Juicy WomenThe book arrived in a timely manner. The content of the book was very simplistic and it left me unsatisfied with the information it offered on this subject. I was left with a thought that a woman age 50 and over already knows this. I wanted a more in-depth discussion, not this surface stuff."
2,Title is more interesting than the book,"I liked the title, but I'm having a hard time finding interest in the book..The book is all about defining the word ""crone"" as just a wise, fun,etc. older women... I got the gist in about 5 pages and I could not keep interested... I skipped around the book looking for more, but there wasn't."
5,Great purchase,This does exactly what it's supposed to do. Works great with our computer and makes Power Point presentation a snap.
5,Excelent for the price,I am very satisfied with this article. No complaints so far. It works fine. I recommend it to anyone who needs a similar article.
2,Pointer review,"This product worked great for about the first three months and then it would fail to connect, wouldn't advance the slides or skip through the whole show at once, and would cause my laptop to freeze a very poor item do not buy. I am looking into some Logitech pointers at my local Staples store that work way better then this device. Word to the wise do not go cheap cause that is what this item is cheaply made and over seas. Go with a name brand such as Logitech made in america and guaranteed to work."
1,laser burnout,we bought 7 of these for my organization and in less than a month the lasers in all 7 have burnt out. it still forwards powerpoint slides but sans laser which is why it's priced so low.
2,Lost laser pointer the first time I used it,"I had to return it within the first month, and after the first time I used it. It was a laser pointer and presentation powerpoint slide advancer, and after the first use, the laser pointer stopped working. Too bad, I liked the convenience of it."
5,very sleek looking!,it does the job too!it was sooo easy to use. all i have to do was plug it in and presto! my presentation is ready to go. no downloads or anything else. very very helpful to me as a teacher.i was sooo happy i bought 4 of these already since my co-teachers were envious of what i had.
4,"Very useful and pretty, only lacking one feature","As I give many lectures I really needed a presentation device. I found this product to be pretty and easy to use. I think the battery life is great and the laser is quite visible. I would only wish it could incorporate a mouse. There are some presentation devices that allow control of the cursor and thus more freedom during a presentation. As this is not a must, I would still recommend this product for its many merits."
1,Horrible,"I have bought THREE of these because they keep breaking. I'm not buying another one. The laser goes very dim, even with fresh batteries. One worked for about 2 months; the other 2 lasted about a week. Also, you can't store it in the case because it tends to push the buttons and drain the batteries. There's no on/off button to prevent this from happening, and the buttons are pretty soft.Plus, it takes a weird battery, which you have to special order.Don't buy it. Just don't."
3,Wireless Red Laser Pointer,"The laser pointer works great, very easy to connect to a computer with the USB equipped receiver. It makes power-point presentations easier because you are freed from having to be by the computer to advance slides. However, I bought several of these for family and co-workers, and in every case the Chinese battery that came with it only lasted about a week. Then it's $4.99 at Radio Shack for a replacement battery. Also be careful how you put the pointer in the case. If the buttons are up, they can be activated by pressure on the closed case, making battery life even less."
5,Awesome Product,Love it! Its so much easier to us this pointer then then a finger...hahaha. It worked well for highlighting important informaion in my presentations an ASIST ( Applied Suicide Intervetnion Skills Training) Trainer.
1,Save your money,The poor battery life of this product renders it almost useless. Find something with standard batteries.
1,Are you serious?,"This album is quite possibly the worst collection of music I have ever heard. Branson Skinner sounds like a mix between John Mayer and a retard. At least John Mayer can sing and play guitar. I dont know how Branson got a record deal, hes awful. Branson, if you are reading this, get voice lessons and dont pollute the world with your music ever again."
1,Content,"I didn't order it because their was no list of the contents . It would be a good idea to show if it contains sonatas , arias or concertos ."
1,Crappy test strips,Colors don't change and strips are useless. don't waste your money. I threw bottle away
4,glad that I chose this strap,"I looked at all of the straps available. My 60's strap needed to be replaced. I wanted something wide to distribute the weight of my electric bass and something that had some padding. A medium priced strap was my interest too. This one fit the bill in every category. If you don't want to spend 125% more for the wide leather straps and don't want a skinny thin nylon job, this one was just right for me."
5,Amazing Strap,This is a great bass strap. It makes playing for hours at a time much more comfortable. I recommend it for others who play live shows or just love jamming with friends.
5,"Memories Are Made Of This, like the aroma of grandma's homemade pasta on a Sunday afternoon","I'm in the business and very rarely actually listen to the CDs I receive. This one has been in my car cd player since I received it! It's a great new perspective on timeless music and a legendary voice. You can feel the pride of a daughter with every note she sings. Its like the kindergartener proudly pointing out ""her daddy,"" Deana sings her father's songs with love, honor and respect. You're a Dean fan before you play her CD, but by the third song, you've unwittingly become a Deana fan. Do your cd player a favor, let the smoothness of Deana's voice set the tone for all the other music you may play on it. Memories are truly made of Deana Martin's new cd."
2,too small,"this item looks alot larger, should have read the dimensions, good price, but too small for any leftovers."
4,"Many games, many uses","Dominoes is a passion in Southern Europe, but no one in the US seems to know the rules. Well, there are several games and the instructions are included. The educational value is math for kids; recognize and match the numbers.If they get bored with dominoes, they can always stack them upright and watch them fall down. This is a good toy for a summer vacation--if you are stuck in cabin at the shore on a rainy day you can play endlessly."
4,Nice Dominoes,"One of the domino blocks has a slight printing flaw, but my husband says it adds character... My young daughter loves to play with them...lining them, stacking them, turning them into fun things from her imagination :) I bought them for her, really, but the instruction sheet descriptively explains 16 different games you can play with them... So, they're really lots of fun for the whole family!"
4,Good History,"This book and the two sequels that follow it are typical Heather Graham, which is good news to those of us who enjoy her writing.In addition to the personal stories in each book, the American history in which the characters are involved is handled very well. Graham can see the several sides of the history at the time her characters live - during and after the Civil War.She is one of the better historical romance writers."
4,The Wonder Of It All,"The Wonder of It AllI learned a few things in this DVD I hadn't heard before. Some information came forth because there were different questions asked of the Moonwalkers that hadn't been asked before. I found it interesting although they should have taken a page from IN THE SHADOW OF THE MOON. In that feature, it was exciting. You couldn't wait for the next moment to see what was going to happen next. They had more historical footage than in TWOIA and it was more dramatic. In TWOIA, it was more focused on interviews and was less exciting for someone who isn't a space buff such as myself."
3,Moon surface from astronauts' perspective,"I liked the video, but was hoping for more of the advertised ""personal experience"" to be centered on the training and anticipation/fear of leaving Earth on top of a rocket. Almost all experiences they share have to do with being ON the moon, which is interesting, but only so much. I would have liked to have had some perspective on what their families thought about what they did for a living, too.I should also mention that I purchased this thinking I could show it to teenage students... they would have found it waaaay too boring, I'm afraid."
1,The wonder of all the BS moon landings,"Charlie Duke and Buzzaroo Aldrin as Actors in the DVD. They got away with their acting job pretending to go to the moon.Now they decided to extend their acting career by acting in this DVD.I'm sure you all will realize the moon landings were Faked. Charlie Duke's famous line ""It's ABSOLUTELY UNREAL"", whilesuppossedly walking on the moon."
4,Quality cable but device end doesn't flex,"This is a nice, standard mini-usb cable for attaching a standard host USB port to most standard USB digital cameras, a Blackberry, external 2.5"" USB hard drives, etc.The cable quality and shielding are excellent, and the cable passes USB2 signals as well as can be expected.The only problem is that the device end of the cable has a very long, stiff connector. This translates too much of the cable weight into the small devices' connectors."
5,Hopeful and helpful,"This book helped me understand how much God cares and that we can trust him. We can count on him to be there when we need him. And of course,we always need him."
1,"Rip OFF Price ,Dont buy this","I know these rappers, bago, dboy, ect.. and there music is not that good to be paying what this seller is trying to sell it for, this specific cd is super old from 11 years ago, they dont even rap anymore, so beware"
4,If one could only live long enough to read all these books!,"I am a sucker for ""books about books"", and this is another valuable resource for the bibliophile, written from a Christian perspective. Actually an expansion from his earlier work, ""Great Books of the Christian Tradition"", this is an excellent reference for great books whether classic or contemporary. Glaspey is not afraid to recommend books with worldviews that are opposed to the evangelical Christian tradition, which I find very commendable. Unfortunately, there are some dubious choices included here, in my opinion, that don't stand up to the other great works included, like Jan Karon's terminally boring ""At Home in Mitford"", or John Grisham's mildly entertaining but far from transcendent ""The Testament"". But you have to admire a guy that has managed to read all these books (you have, haven't you, Terry?), and his enthusiasm for great literature is contagious. A must-have for book lovers!"
5,The Stamp Act,"Every once in a while, I need to stamp several envelopes with either my name and mail code number, or a big all-caps ""CONFIDENTIAL."" Our office supply manager has bought two types, the XSTAMPER, and something called the ""2000 Plus"" by Printer 20 (or it could be the Printer 20, by 2000 Plus.)XSTAMPER has none of the problems of the later product which notably includes the jamming or reversal of the internal stamping mechanism. XSTAMPER has a more solid feel, a great gip through a non-slippery surface with wide concave areas for your fingers, and is well-balanced. The stamper works fast, the ink lasts long and stays wet even is you leave the cap off, and it's dependable and durable. If your official office catalogue (if you have one) permits you to buy the XSTAMPER, by all means order some."
1,Never got it!,"I am very upset with the company! I ordered it for a x-mas gift and the delivery date was pushed back to end of January. Feburary came they pushed it to the end of March. Today I get a e-mail saying it won't be delivered until the end of May!!! I canceled my order, I love Amazon but am not a bit happy with this product company!"
1,NO BEST SELLER LIST.....,DO YOU THNIK THIS BOOK MADE THE BEST SELLERS LIST ..NO WAY..THE BOOK I PURCHASED (HOLLYWOOD THEN AND NOW) IS JUNKDONT WAST YOUR MONEY ..EVEN IT THERE IS A BIG DISOUNT ..THAT SHOULD TELL YOU SOMETHING.. !!!
1,Extremely Disappointed,"I was given this book by a friend because he knows I was raised in Hollywood and love the history of the area. The archival photographs are quite nicely reproduced, however, the current photographs are very poor. I enjoy digital photography and was in Hollywood a few weeks ago and visited the same historic scenes from this book. I quite easily found the angle of the original shots found in this book.. why this book showed those same shots but taken from different angles than the original photos is beyond me. The modern photos in this book are also very unflattering, out of focus and even amateur in appearance... not much more than snapshots.The worst thing about this book are the many obvious mistakes in locations and historic details. What a shame."
5,Hollywood Then and Now,"I had been so impressed with the quality and accuracy of Rosemary Lord's book LOS ANGELES THEN AND NOW that I was delighted to find this new book HOLLYWOOD THEN AND NOW. It is brilliant and fascinating. This is an impressive, informative history of Hollywood. I worked in the Hollywood Motion Picture Industry during much of this time and Lord has captured the world I remember so well. I was pleased to see this book on the L.A. Times Bestseller List in January when it first came out and have bought several copies as they make great gifts. I look forward to her next book."
5,Harvard Football is alive and well!,"You can not find a finer book which exemplifies what American football is all about. The grit, drive, and determination of the Harvard Crimson, who play the game, not for money, or recognition, but for the love of the game. I love this book and recommend it to all sports fans and football fans alike. FIVE STARS! Great information amidst all of the awesome historical and modern football photos. And how can you not love a team that had actor Tommy Lee Jones as an All American offensive guard! Great photo of Tommy Lee Jones in his Harvard Crimson uniform. Buy this book today!Dave in N.E."
5,A-1 Seller,"The product was exactly what we hoped for and the person we bought it for loved it. We placed the order, and it arrived within the time frame promised . What else can a buyer hope for.ThanksFrancine"
5,Awesome!,I love this CD. The lyrics are just so poetical and make you understand God more as you listen to it. The performances are astounding. I can just listen to this CD over and over.
5,I wish I had known of Rich before his death!,"For someone like myself that just discovered Rich Mullins,The Jesus Record displays his briliance and simplicity. I heard the song ""My Deliver"" on KDAR radio in Ventura. I coudn't get it out of my head. I looked at the CCM charts to see who did it and it was listed as Rich Mullins. I got the cassette and have listened to the entire tape numerous times.Rich has the ability to musically and poetically express what we all feel while trying to seek the Lord. As a fan of Bob Dylan, I'm happy to say if you love great mucic and lyrics that will stir your soul, buy the Jesus Record.In addition to hearing a DC Talk version of ""My Deliver"" in the upcoming movie, Prince of Egypt, expect to hear ""My Deliver"" in churches in the future. I believe it will become the next ""Awesome God"", which Rich also wrote."
5,Fitting Title from an Artist for the Ages,"After his untimely death, Rich Mullins' band, the Ragamuffins, decided to take his last recorded effort and develop it into this CD entitled ""The Jesus Record,"" as a tribute. Rich Mullins was always true to his savior, which is why the CD is named as it is. His band understood that too.This is one of the best collections of contemporary Christian music that you will ever find. Little kids will even like ""My Deliverer"" and sing the lyrics when you least expect it. The last song on the CD, ""That Where I Am,"" ends with Rich's voice and his laugh. It's hauntingly appropriate, to say the least."
5,"Who is Jesus? an honest, Christian perspective","The question ""Who is Jesus?"" is at the very center of Christianity. This set of songs is one of the best explorations of that question I have experienced. It is honest, gritty, hits right at the heart of the listener and of the Christian experience. The knowledge of Rich Mullins' fate only adds to the intensity of his lyrics, highlighting the need for more of Mullins' honesty in Christian worship and prayer. The honesty of ""Hard to Get"" grabbed me the first time I heard this CD and continued to do so for the rest of the CD, and continues each time I listen. Such a shame this CD is no longer in production! I like the original Rich Mullins recordings best, along with several other reviewers, and the CD of remakes sits unused in its case."
5,Emotionally Fullfulling,A local Catholic priest sang a few songs from this Cd andit really moved me. He highly recommended it. I purchased it. I am now listening to it. It is bringing tears to my eyes. It realy makes us realize who our Dear Lord Jesus really is. I am recovering from breast cancer and listen to the Cd for comfort and inspiration. Rich Mullins was a special man blessed by God to bring his news to us. I pray he is at peace with The Lord.Buy the cd and open your heart to the Lord.
5,A brilliant final work!!!,"The first track on the ""Record"" cd (and the first track released as a single) sets you up well -- the second verse describes Jesus as a young boy in Egyptian exile with his parents, hearing echos (figuratively) of the people of Israel calling for a deliverer -- and this young child knows that he is that deliverer, and that deliverance will cost him his very life blood. Thus a tone is set that this CD will be sure you think about Jesus in terms our white bread, American/western thinking would never naturally like to think about. BUY THIS CD, and share it."
5,I almost cried during some of the songs.,"""The Jesus Record"" is one of the best I've ever heard. It was so like Rich!"
3,Great Worship CD!,Few come close to the lyrics of Rich Mullins! I enjoyed his side of the cd..even with the throwback cassette stopping noise. I was not at all impressed with the remakes by the newer generation. Rich Mullins truely was blessed with a gift for lyrics and music writing. We've been blessed to enjoy him.
5,One last great album,"As fans of Rich Mullins know, Rich Mullins died while working on this album. At the time that he died, he had already made a bare bones demo of 9 of the 10 songs. That demo is included as one of the two discs on the albums. The demo alone is reason enough to buy this album as it showcases Rich's great singing and songwriting ability.After Rich's death, the album was completed with some of his friends in Christian Music lending their voices to make these songs come to life with full musical orchestration. Each one of these songs is a gem in itself. I have had this cd for several years now and I play it constantly. My favorite selections on it are ""My Deliverer"" in which Ragmuffin Rick Elias sings lead, ""Surely God is With Us"" in which Ragmuffin Mark Robertson sings lead, and ""All the Way to Kingdome Come"" in which three of the Ragmuffins and Phil Keaggy sing lead."
4,"Goodbye and Godspeed, Rich Mullins","I was both elated and disappointed with The Jesus Record. I was elated because the demos CD was undiluted Rich Mullins -- rough, poetic songs played in an abandoned church somewhere in the Midwest. The honesty and vibrancy Rich displays while recording these songs is heartbreaking when one thinks about how soon his life would end after making this recording.The actual record, unfortunately, was a disappointment. The artists who collaborated to make this album are to be commended for their efforts at arranging and performing Rich's songs, but without Rich singing it just isn't the same. Notable exceptions are Man of No Reputation, beautifully done but not one of Rich's songs, and That Where I Am, the final track, which included Rich's demo in the final recording. These are great songs and the album is a fitting tribute to Rich, but unfortunately without his presence the finished product is not as good."
4,Rich Mullins!,"At the time I am writing this, there are 63 other reviews! Why should you read mine? Why should I even repeat what others undoubtedly say about this CD? I dunno :)There are two CD's in this set - the ""demos"" by Rich himself; and the ""record"" by the Raggamuffins. While the ""record"" is Ok, by far the best material is the raw recordings of Rich Mullins.If you like Rich Mullins, this should be a most welcome CD to your collection. Firstly, it's the last live record of Rich before he went home. Secondly, the music and lyrics are quite good of themselves. I actually prefer the ""demo"" disc, and my absolute favorite is ""My Deliverer is coming"". Oh, the joy when I crank that up and sing loudly along with it."
5,This is the best cd they have done in a long time.,This is the next thing to stomp to beside kirk Franklin
4,Escape from Corregidor,'The Last Lieutenant' tells the story of the brave men and woman who served on the fortess island of Corregidor in the Phillipines during the brutal Japanese onslaught and a fictional account of a daring escape. Lt. Todd Ingram and rag-tag bunch of navy and army men escape the horror of the Japanese attack in a small patrol boat with which they hope to make it to Austrailia. With the Japanese air force and navy hot on his tail Ingram must use all of his cunning to evade the Pacific aggressors. But Ingram has another mission as well: serving in a US navy uniform is a Nazi spy that knows the details about the Midway offensive. If this spy warns the Japanese in time what's left of the US Pacific fleet is doomed. The story that follows is a thrilling race between the two men to reach civilization. A lot of fun and a wonderful view of the battle for the Phillipines.
4,Very good read. Lots of twists and turns to the story. Good character development.,Very good story and the author succeeded in making me believe I was alongside the characters in their quest for survival.
3,Hose Holder,Great product. Came on time and works fine. The only thing I can suggest is the part that gets put in the ground should be spike shape to get into hard or rocky ground. It's very difficult to put the square bottom of the pole in the ground.
4,"Good product, bad knob",Solidly built and great for adding a faucet to another yard location without hiring a contactor. The only thing I didn't like is the tiny faucet knob. Why couldn't they put in a better knob?
3,not just for being fat this album will be good.......,....ok ok I love fat comps....but this one is not the greatest....yeah I know the NOFX song is so great and the closed track from wizo and even mfatgg but that's it..this album has some nice unreleased songs from no use for a name and good riddance but after that starts a boring environment....I think it needed some propagandhi stuff......or something.....but don't get mad....this album is quite greater than the first edition....ok ok that's not true.....the other fat comps .are great...go buy one fellas....thy re pretty cheap just like you....
1,Escape Into Boredom,"This book appears to be autobiographical, with a sci-fi twist. Unfortunately, the writing and the sci-fi angle are both child-like. The author is narcissistic, self-righteous and judgmental. He's also an unabashed homophobe (at least he's honest about that), and probably a misogynist. The writing is monotonous and filled with cliches, not to mention countless grammatical errors. The reading is slow and painful. If there is one saving grace to this tome, it's to remind us of the conservative nuts in our own back yards."
3,This product was okay. I think it may ...,"This product was okay. I think it may have improved the air flow through my nose a little bit, but not significantly. The first night that I wore it the strip fell off."
4,"I guess I am """"lucky"""" in that I ...","I guess I am """"lucky"""" in that I just happened to get a cold when I got my nasal strips. I thought I'd like that the nasal strips where made with Vicks but it didn't seem to be enough to make a huge difference. But then again I was REALLY stuffed up. Using regular Vicks Vapor Rub gave me more relief. I think that for mild congestion this product might be more beneficial."
1,Bugged and disgusted,"I have two computers, and this program runs on neither one! You must have an internet connection or the program cannot run - despite what it says on the package about ""internet functionality"".The program fails with a critical error on my laptop, which is connected to the internet.I deeply regret spending money on Money 2006. Thirty bucks that I will never see again :.("
2,not working for me.,"i cannot get any information from my bank through microsoft money standard here in Alaska, they do not interact."
1,Don't buy this,We purchased this version when we upgraded to Windows XP. The old version of MS money we have been using for years did not work on windows XP. This version is terrible compared to the old version and we are going to move to Quicken. We can't figure out where it's getting the numbers for the budget portion of the program. It appears to be randomly multiplying deposits by two or just ignoring them. The budget numbers were just nonsense. We could not make corrections to investment stock symbols etc. The bottom line is this software has gone downhill and we no longer even trust it to add 2 and 2. It doesn't even deserve one star.
2,Was Great,Was great until Microsoft stopped supporting it. I originally had a older version and recomended and purchased this version for a friend. A few years later Microsoft stopped support for it.
1,I give it an F,"I have been working happily with MS Money on my Windows XP computer. I just bought a second Windows Vista computer and downloaded a new version of Money Essentials on it, so I can work with my Money files on the new computer. The new version of Money can not read the .mny files on the older version! So there is no way I can work with my own Money data on my computer (if I had bee a Quicken user, I could transfer the data).Money has become a useless product for me - I give it an F."
1,Less Than Worthless,Not only does it not support downloads from my bank (Bank of America!!!!!!!!) you get ADVERTISING banners in your application. I can't believe it. I pay money and they still advertise 3rd party products and services to me. I'm sending it BACK!
1,Converting from Quicken Doesn't Work,"If you try to convert a quicken file with password protection it will just tell you it was unable to convert the file. No other messages. Take off the password protection (even though it says it will still convert it). Once I had converted the file I noticed several accounts in the summary did not match balances. I have financial information for 10+ years, there is no way I am going to line by line double check entries.I wouldn't bother buying this if you expect to convert from Quicken to Money."
1,One star * review if I could change it.,As usual Microsoft releases buggy software and expects you to fix it with a update. Problem is the update is buggy as well. After hours of research on GOOGLE. I found my answer. If you are trying to apply the update and you get a error. Boot into safe mode in xp and install the update in safe mode.Could you make it any harder Bill??
2,Not an Upgrade,"Microsoft pulled a fast one on us. Instead of increaing functionality with the Money 2006 Standard, they actually removed the tax estimating and planning functionality. If this is critical, do not ""upgrade"" or go with the Deluxe version."
1,2006 or 2005?,"I just bought and loaded 2006 Standard. It is identical to 2005, matter of fact I thought the install failed and was still on '05.Save your money if you already have 2005."
3,Gets the job done,"Had been using MS Money 2002 up to this point and really loved it. Circumstances forced me to upgrade my Compaq laptop with this version. Although I'm not a big fan of this version, it does get the job done. The the program files loaded off the CD-ROM with no problems and I suffered no hang-ups, stalls, or anything else when loading and installing. Insofar as the program itself is concern, MS Money 2002 is better, but this version will do. It's a sign of the times."
2,Short Fun,My son found this fun and couldn't wait to complete all the tasks. He played for two hours on two days and finished it and that's it. No other levels or games or new challenges. The only other things you can do are paint pictures and put stamps on calendars. He found buying things with the correct change & measuring things to be the most fun. He said the math was hard (14+5+2=_) so instead of trying to add these he simply counted all the objects they put on the screen by the question. Overall I was disappointed with this program-didn't really seem to be teaching him a lot. Not worth the 9 bucks I paid for it.
3,Experts on Everything,"This book isn't entirely worthless -- but it illustrates the tendency of scientific specialists to think that they're experts on everything. Wills not only professes to know evolutionary biology: he knows everything else as well.Except that he doesn't.To avoid tedium, I'll just give one example. While talking about the genetic isolation of the European Neandertal, Wills mentions by way of analogy a ""mysterious"" people who speak a ""mysterious"" language called Ladin. How mysterious!Wills even tells us that these origins are very mysterious.But there's really nothing mysterious about them at all. Ladin is a Romance language, no more mysterious than French and Italian. As the name should indicate, Ladin comes from Latin. Duh.And so science marches on!"
5,Please come back...,Hip Hop now really needs a strong rapper...Male or Female. Get back in the studio !!!
5,Los de Los Santos,"This music is bringing me memories back when I was only a kid, in the summer I spent school vacation time in the Panama country side and I heard this music before. I'm 58 now but with this music I feel like a 8 years old kid. I'm very pleased with this wonderful and original Panama's folclore music."
2,Lots of info but a disappointing read.,"After reading the reviews of this book I purchased it and was disappointed. While Bob Beauchemin certainly seems to know quite a bit about databases and ADO.Net I found that his writing style made it hard for me to learn as much as I had hoped I would. He tends to just state facts (useful as they may be) without giving proper context. He never seems to explain why something is the way it is. Similarly, while each example covers the intended functionality, they are only rarely explained.Having finished reading the book I feel an army draftee who is taught how to shoot and march and then dropped into a war zone without a clue as to actually survive."
4,A comprehensive reference to ADO.NET,I was generally very pleased with this book. It is an excellent reference for .NET developers using any of the more advanced features of ADO.NET. Bob's chapter on XML integration with ADO.NET is particularly well done.I expect to be using this book as a reference for years to come.My only compliant is that the book sometimes blurs the distinctions between SQL Server and other relational databases such as Oracle and DB2 UDB. Features that are only relevant to SQL Server are sometimes lumped together with more general database connectivity issues. It would have been clearer to have separate chapters for using ADO.NET with databases other than Microsoft SQL Server.
3,You can use it...,"It's not bad, you can use it.If you like VERY BIG FONTS AND MARGINS you can even enjoy it. Especially if you are kind of person who like style of Ken Henderson's ""The Guru's Guide to SQL Server Stored Procedures, XML, and HTML"". This one is also guru-made.But if you need less water and more value for your money - get yourself ""Microsoft ADO.NET (Core Reference)"" by David Sceppa."
3,For $4 why not,"Movie was good, not great. Shaun of the dead is way better. But it's only $4 why not? Ending wasn't the good to me"
3,not as funny as people say,yo i don't know how people can give so many movie great reviews is the world filled with millions of patrick stones. anyways the movies okay 3 or 4 oh haha kinda parts and thats pretty much it. a funnier movie is the revenant not great but a little funnier than this one. overall it was just good enough to watch it until the end.
3,Subtitles make for difficult viewing,It was a fun movie and worth watching. But having to read subtitles is never conducive to Action Flicks. I would much rather an English dubbed version.
3,"Overrated, But Still Worth Watching","Juan of the Dead is not a five star movie, at least not in my opinion. For my money, this year's Zombie Babies is a funnier film. Still, 'Juan' does have its moments and it is worth a look. There's some good-looking women, good-looking zombies, and a few laughs."
3,Juan de los muertos....Alabao!,"I sorry to say but....if you have not lived in or totally understand todays Cuba, probably you may not enjoy this movie as much....in rating the movie I would say...average actors, sometimes very funny scenes, some double meaning words that shows real approach to live in the island.....if you can get the dvd cheap, then buy it...."
4,Subtitles and All,I really enjoyed this film. it is low budget but the characters are so likable and funny that the lack of effects are easily forgiven.
4,"An Entertaining, Educational Book","I was skeptical of this book at first, not having had *any* fighting experience. I was hoping it wouldn't be a book about ways to fight, and I bought it partly because of its subtitle: How to AVOID a Fight...Alain teaches in this book like an old storyteller, telling us why he has fought, why he no longer fights, and what to do if you have absolutely no choice. His tales of Army days in Korea, college days in Montana and travels in Thailand and Vietnam give you something to think about in almost every situation."
4,"A worthwhile book, full of common sense.","Hard Won Wisdom is a book about NOT fighting. That's what makes it so worthwhile. There have been hundreds of books written about fighting and how to win fights. This book is about making good decisions about fighting, coming from a man who has the experience to back this kind of advice.Alain is a down to earth guy who has taken the time to document lessons he's learned along the way. Many people learn these lessons, but not many have the talent to tell their stories the way Alain does. A worthwhile book for anyone interested in gaining wisdom the easy way."
4,Mr. Perfect's 2nd Intercontinental Victory:Complete 11/19/90 match,"This 60 minute tape is number WS910 from the WWF collector series and features Mr.Perfect and the Texas Tornado on the cover.Matches include:1.Mr. Perfect vs. Texas Tornado from WWF Superstars on 11/19/90. Match is complete with both entrances and Ted Dibiase bribing Howard Finkel to be the ""Guest"" Ring Announcer. This is the only place to get the 2nd IC victory by Mr. Perfect (his first was earlier in the year over Tito Santana) as the match was unfortunately left off of his just released WWE DVD.2.The Model vs. Marty Jannetty3.Hulk/Tugboat vs. Rhythm and Blues (SNME)4.Bossman vs. Barbarian5.Ultimate Warrior vs. Ted Dibiase (SNME)match where Savage destroys Warrior afterDibiase is disqualified for Virgil's interference."
5,Complete Test Standards,The criteria needed to pass your flight review. Every detail explained and the bible before your test.
5,A great look at the entertainment industry,"Parenti does an excellent job in exposing how lopsided the entertaiment industry is, and how Right it is centered. He looks at aspects as diverse as Oscar winning movies to WWF wrestling, and how politically oriented they are, more often then not the Right. The Cold War did a number on American movies and it tainted the industry to this day in producing mediocre films that did not threaten or offend anyone high in power. I feel that today the situation is improved just a little bit, with more accurate portrayels of minorities and women and so forth, but we still have a long way to go in the entertainment industry. An excellent book for anyone at all interested in the entertainment industry and an eye opener as well."
3,Classification of languages,"A very good book that does a lot of hard work in classifying an extremely large number of languages.The author blindly assumes evolution as fact, and for this, I am disappointed. But, what to expect from secular scientists? The material is still valid."
5,"Appropriate as a gift, or for yourself","I purchased this book after being diagnosed with Lupus and it helped me focus on various issues for living with a chronic disease. The author, Kathleen Lewis, has a very similar diagnosis to mine, and she explains how she coped and the lifestyle changes she made. As a nurse and counselor, she offers a wealth of complete information from how to approach the medical establishment, to how to reward yourself, to fostering acceptance of the disease, both within and with friends. She has thoroughly researched a number of issues and then compiled it into this book. It is an upbeat and concise chronicle of an otherwise demoralizing experience. Since few of my friends can relate to my health issues, I found her to be a companion with good advice."
5,Athur,Hi I am Kathleen Lewis.I wrote Celebrate Life.I am honored and humbled by all who may find it useful in any way.My new website is wwwletscelebratelife.netYou can go to my blog and find a companion book ... Prayer Without Ceasing ... Breath Prayers
5,fantastic,Love Tammy! I would not have put so many 80's performances on there and added more songs from the 70's.
4,Englsih/Hindi-Hindi/English dictionary,I have another dictionary and phrase book by the same person and find the both useful but frustrating sometimes. I wish there was in this dictionary a list of the Hindi alphabet since it's not the same as the romanized version of HIndi words. Often I can't find words that I see and hear in Indian movies so I can't tranlste them. I also wish I could buy a dictionary of Hindi slang or street language as most modern movies are full of that and not the more formaal Hindi in a dictionary.
4,Excellent English to Hindi dictionary,This an Excellent English to Hindi dictionary. Small and light enough to carry around. It has most words that one encounters everyday
3,A reasonable book at the price,"It's compact, and reasonably good in coverage. It's OK for the price I paid for it."
2,Meant for Native Speakers,"I bought this book hoping that it would allow me to look up words in English and find an equivalent word in Hindi. This dictionary seems to be meant for native Hindi speakers who need English words translated for them. I say this because rather than giving equivalent Hindi words, the book gives a description of the entry in Hindi. For example (this is not a real entry) for a sun flower, rather than giving the Hindi word (if any exists) for sun flower, it will say (in Hindi) ""A flower with yellow petals..."".I'm somewhat of a native speaker, but this dictionary doesn't help me at all since my goal isn't trying to get a description of things in Hindi. I totally wasted my money."
3,"Not very good, but certainly better than nothing.","This dictionary is indeed rather complex. I read the script perfectly and even still can't make much sense out of a great deal of it. Whether or not its in script or not is not the issue here. The issue is alot of the words aren't really the words used in Hindi. They are more words adopted from English than the sanskritized words. So for those of us wishing to learn the traditional truely Hindi words this could pose a problem. Another thing that is ridiculous is alot of basic words such as ""Spanish"" aren't in this dictionary. For a dictionary that is supposed to be so concise I'd hardly consider basic words like ""Spanish"" a word to leave out. I am sure there are better dictionaries out there and wouldn't really recommend it, but I suppose it's better than nothing."
3,Dictionary for beginner,No good for beginner since no prononciation in romanized characters and a bit short. for hindi speaking people no problemthat is why i put a medium note. Depends on who uses it
2,For Hindi Script Readers,"If you can read the Devnagari script, this dictionary will be useful. However, if you can't read it you will not be able to translate a single word. Even the introduction that describes how the dictionary is organized is written in Hindi, and the key that describes how words are listed is written in Hindi. There is no English introduction or key. There is no transliteration or phonetic spelling of the Hindi words into English. The Devnagari script is clear and crisp. I would only recommend this dictionary if you can easily read Devnagari."
4,hindi english lesson,I really appreciate the fact that the book was sent out rather quickly. It is also a thorough dictionary. It was just what I expected and more.
4,Timeline of Technology,"It's really interesting to get the background and more importantly the story behind the names that you hear in the circles of technology. Visiting laboratories, and libraries named after people you know about is much more interesting than when you have a little knowledge. Technomanifesto's is a unique compilation of technologies' history, a must read for anyone that considers themself a technophile."
3,not too bad,"If you are like me and enjoy books in this genre, this is worth a read. If you are only going to read one book, start elsewhere."
2,Try Another Levinson Book Instead,"I bought this book becasue I thought a 30 day, self-guided tour of Guerrilla Marketing would be a handy tool in my marketing tool kit.I was disappointed.The book is a regurgitation of Levinson's principles, which are more fully described in Levinson's other books,like Guerrilla Marketing. The 30 day approach is artificial, and the marketing advice in this book is almost too simplistic to be actionable.Levinson has written so many insightful books that you'd do better to dive into one of his thoughtful books and absorb his timeless advice. This book misses that mark with its pat advice to complex marketing issues.I think the format for the book is a good one, but the execution wasn't."
5,Sharpen Your Guerrilla Weapons,"I highly recommend this very practical and readable book. Chocked-full with terrific, innovative ideas and an easy to follow plan, there are no more excuses for flagging business. Sure to make a real impact in the world of business growth, Lautenslager and Levinson have hit their target head on. This is a must read for everyone interested in creating more leads and landing more business."
5,Cute saucer.,"This saucer is a larger than the tea cup saucer and fits the cream soup bowl, the breakfast cup and the creamer. I use mine everyday for coffee, since I like the size of the breakfast cup. I also use an additional one for the creamer, to keep drips off the table. These are well made and have one cute little lady bug on them, as well as leaves and a blue border."
3,what they know about mother's finest,I prefer the original song love changes I don't know what immature's doing sampliong this.
2,20/20 Hindsight trading method fudged to get good results,"I found his trading method difficult to understand. He glosses over his trading method and does not explain it with enough detail. I had to read the pages over and over again just to get a grasp of his system. Basically, he is using channelling to detect reversals of up and down trends. Half of the book uses his method to analyze the Dow Jones Industrial Average for a ten year period. In following his analysis, there were quite a few times when it seemed like he did not follow his own rules. It looks like he was doing that to make his trading results look good."
1,The Ultimate Rip-Off of Your Time and Money,"The Ultimate Breakthrough in Market Turning Point Detection by Jeffery A Cuddy describes the author's PAMA (Pivotal Area of Market Analysis) method that the author claims to trade successfully. After studying the book both inside and out, I would rename it, The Ultimate Rip-Off Of Your Time and Money. Do not buy this book!The author does go to great lengths to give the reader his rules for trading channels he creates. The whole method to his madness is knowing how wide to create these channels. And guess what? That information cannot be found in this book. Mr. Cuddy, gives you numerous rules to trade the channels, but doesn't give you the method on how wide to create them. Until he writes another book with that information, learning the PAMA method is a complete waste of time and money."
2,"Redundant hands -ree, lousy case and a charger","I was looking for a case for my T610 and at $15, this appeared to be a good deal. However the case is quite bulky and ugly. The notches and openings dont fit right; especially the hole for the camera is way off and you can't take pictures without removing the case. The worst is however the steel belt clip; which is not detachable and is really big and irritating. So, if you plan to carry your cell-phone in your pockets most of the time, this one's not right for you. I got a handsfree as a freebie with the phone itself and haven't used the car charger yet. T610 has a great battery life, so you probably won't need to use it often."
2,How much of what?,"So, what are you selling?Here is the description you are publishing:CLOTHESLINE 25\' X 3/16""100 ft. of tough 1/4"" braided nylon utility cord with plastic rewinder.So, is it 25 feet of 3/16 clothesline?Or, 100 feet of 1/4"" braided, etc.????"
5,Great Mil Spec pack,This is a high quality Military Spec pack! I love it and it is a small Alice Pack but still looks like it would hold plenty for it's size. I love it and think you would too.
5,BIG DADDY'S at FSU (#2) is worth the price alone,"how georgia beat those guys is beyond me, but the hot fsu chicks get crazy at that bar was worth getting the dvd. my friends at fsu told me about that place... im transferring !!!"
3,Singles Are Too Expensive,"The songs on the single are good, but the price oyu pay for one song are outragous. Though the songs on this single are good. They are a nice blend of dance, r& b, and rap. The song SHOW ME is a chart toper that puts you in the dancin' mood."
4,great toy,"I got 2 of these toy stethescopes - one for my child and one for my friend's child - they both love to take them around and listen to things in the house (clock, water heater, etc.) They really work and seem pretty durable."
3,Not really enough for 9 cameras,"This unit was used for a 9 camera environment. A mix of 6 CCD cameras with LED IR and 3 CMOS cameras.Picture quality was generally lousy among the CCD cameras until we removed 2 of them to their own power bricks. Still a couple are having difficulty and we will be moving them to bricks soon making us wonder why we bothered with the 9 camera box.As another reviewer commented, the 18 camera unit makes much more sense and I concur with their other comments about safety, etc.Because it does not support the number of camera is claims (these are not higher power PTZ cameras) it only gets 3 stars in my review."
3,Just an ordinary messenger bag..,"I bought this bag to protect my Dell Inspiron 5100. Come to find out, it's just a regular messenger bag with compartments big enough to fit a laptop, cell phone, pda, ect. There is NO padding in the laptop compartment. So if you actually want to protect your laptop I wouldn't recommend this bag."
2,Much smaller than stated,"I was looking for an 8"" square baking dish and thought this would do the trick, but the actual baking area measured about 6.5"" - much smaller than I thought. Although a lovely dish, not the right size for me."
3,good,"westerns are my husbands kind of books, he read the five in this series and said that they were good."
4,Slept on group,"I remeber back in the spring of 1995, Candy Rain was a huge hit for Soul IV Real. Going to the middle school dances and hearing this song would be the highlight of the night. The follow up song Every Little Thing I Do which sampled The Gap Band was another huge smash, but for some reason their parent label MCA seemed to focus more on Immature.Soul For Real had good production due to Heavy D and Kenny ""G-Love"" Greene manning the group behind the scenes."
5,This CD is it!! Mad vocals all over the place.You betta know,If you don't have this. What are ya sleeping on? This CD is on from start to finish. I am looking forward to a new CD from Soul for Real. I was hooked from the start.
4,Candy Rain- Soul for Real,"This is an amazing soulful album. Most of the tracks are worth listening to, and most of them are midtempo, but the slower songs are the infectious ""Spend the Night"" and ""Thinking of You."" The way the rhythms mingle with the vocals on this classic album is marvelous. Even though there's a couple of remakes (Ain't No Sunshine & If Only You Knew), you will hardly be disappointed with this selection from Soul for Real."
3,My Candy Rain,Glad to have this maxi single because I've been looking for the TrackMasters (forgive the spelling) mix of this song without it being mixed with others like on the MTV Party To Go cds.
5,Soul IV Real..........GREAT SOUND!,"I think Soul IV Real should have gotten better props....this cd is very nice! Being a huge Michael Jackson fan, Soul IV Real reminds me so much of the Jackson 5. Candy Rain was released when I was 15 and I rememeber buying the Candy Rain single and listening to it EVERY DAY......I even had my parents loving that song. Then, I heard the cd and fell in love. (I love the re-make of ""If Only You Knew"") I saw them sing live twice and they never disappointed me. I think Soul IV Real can show groups like B2K a thing or 2."
2,A mediocre album at best,"These guys have vocal harmony however they lack the substance that makes truly great songs.Their first hit ""Candy Rain"" was, is the best and only good song on the album. That being said if you have a friend who already has this c.d. ask them to burn one for you. Don't waste your money on the disc because it ain't worth it."
4,Well Worth The Time,"Quite enjoyable, but also an appealingly heartfelt look at the scary prospect of being a new parent in a foreign land and the sickness of your newborn. Good for Anglophiles and new parents alike."
5,"A Hilarious, Moving and Heartwarming True Tale","A smart, snappy, utterly charming book that will make you laugh, cry, and smile in recognition. Ann Leary writes with humor and pathos about meeting her husband and starting a family. If you love movies like ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and fish out of water tales with a happy ending, you'll love this book."
5,A poignant story with lots of humor,"Loved this book by new author Leary. She kept my attention from beginning to end. A book anyone would love, especially a parent. I wonder what it's like living in the Leary household with two hilarious parents! What's next?"
5,I'll just...,"...go along with all the other reader/reviewers who gave this memoir Five Stars. It's a quick, though thoughtful read."
4,Like Lunch With a Friend,"Women love to share their birth stories, especially with good friends. Ann Leary's novel makes the reader feel like they are laughing and joking about the time of their children's births over coffee. By the end of her book, I felt like good friends with Leary. She is smart, funny, and not afraid to expose her insecurities in a way that we can all relate with. A fun, quick, satisfying read!"
5,Very Entertaining,"This book was very entertaining. I felt like I could relate to a lot of the author's experiences. In my opinion, she did such a good job telling her story, I found it hard to put the book down at times."
4,Can he still get down?,"Yes he can..I know alot of people left my man Craig when he left BAD-Boy?.. cant blame MAck tho..I thought this album was a real nice surprise and i did enjoy it..Good party Joint..pop it in and you'll see Trax like ""If theres a cure"" ""one more day"" and ""rain"" are all hot to trot..nice beats and C Mack can still flow..I hope he does another ablum soon cause he still can ""Get Down""..bonis"
3,you really need a book for hitchhiking?,"isn't the essential idea of hitchhiking setting off to the unknown -improvising, being spontaneous and up for the adventure to discover yourself?!if, instead, you are interested in finding out crazy anecdotes from a real adventurer try this one: (...)"
4,garden neat,Helpful in keeping the hose neat and accessable. No longer have to trip over it on the ground.
3,Don't order here if color is an issue!,"Oh well, guess our little 12 month-old boy is flexible when it comes to color...we received one pink cup & one yellow cup instead of the blue & green cups I ordered. Haven't tried them yet as far as their spill proof-ness!"
3,did not get product shown,"Gerber cups are my favorite. For some reason, it has been very difficult to find them at the stores lately. I was very glad to see Amazon has them. However, what I received was not what I thought I bought! The picture shows 2 sippy cups with handles. What I received had no handles.Here's the worse part - the lid where the valve fits in has already cracked with only a few uses. The problem is the valve fits in tightly (which is normally a good thing so there's no leakage). But the tight fit feels like it doesn't fit right. I think it cracked from being pushed too far in. But how are you supposed to know how far to push in??Based on my experience, the straight spout Gerber/Nuk cups aren't as good as the angled spout ones."
2,Ordered many of these but...,Kept getting girl colors! That's really sad since I liked them. We switched to nuk instead of these because they worked better.
5,Kids Still Love Them A Year Later!,"Our kids (now 2+ y/o) have been using these sippys for well over a year, with no need to replace them an no complaints. We only use sippys for water, so I can't attest to whether the valves are hard to clean if you use juice or milk in them. The only time spills are a problem is when a kid deliberately turns the cup upside-down and shakes vigorously. Even then, it usually isn't more than a few drops."
4,Love NUK cups!,"All my son's cups are from NUK, so far. But I am probably going to magrate to another company because he really needs a cup with cap, and NUK doesn't have to many options. but, product is very good, good quality, excatly size I was looking for...I don't like that big sippy cups. I reccomend it."
3,good under surveilance,"they come with a plug inside so they don't leak, but my little guy couldn't get water out when that was inserted. since about 9 months he has done great drinking out of it with the plug removed, but then it spills a lot when he shakes it around and plays with it. perfect when i'm able to watch him and be sure it's upright, but a minor disaster when he has control in his car seat or stroller."
3,I got a pink and green translucent cup.,"I have a baby boy and i ordered from this page taking the risk of ""colors may vary""; But i still thought the cups are transparent and the lids would be the dominant color.However I received Pink and green colored cups, not just the lids, but the cups were colored. Not transparent like the image shown!I had to travel and had no time for returns, but i am not able to use the pink cups in public for my little boy."
5,Best Sippy!,"I started giving this sippy cup to my daughter when she was 9 months. I tried a bunch of different sippy cups and this one she got the hang of first. She is almost two years old and it is still our go to sippy cup. She can now drink out of any cup - straw, regular cup with no lid, etc. I continue to go back to this cup because it doesn't leak at all, is super easy to clean and holds the perfect amount of liquid."
2,confused about the great reviews...,"I bought these sippy cups based on the great reviews, but I'm disappointed. Yes, they don't leak, but my daughter (2 yrs old) has a hard time sucking the milk/juice from them, like the spill proof seal is a little too tight. And even when she does get the milk out, there is always about a half inch left that she can't get out because the spill proof insert sticks out too much and doesn't allow the milk to funnel down... even when I tried to drink from it to see why she was struggling with getting that last bit out, I couldn't. Bad design... wasteful and it frustrates my daughter because she can see more in the cup but can't get it out."
5,Amazing!,"Defently one of the best books I've ever read. It contains 12 different stories that are happy, sad, and some were downright scary."
1,think again,"Many of these stories are disturbingly morbid and unpleasant. If you are a parent, please look it over before letting your child read it."
5,The best of its kind,"Washington, DC is an unique capital city and Robert Cameron shares his birdeye's view with us in this marvelous volume. For residents and vistors alike, this is extraordinary record of the city, particularly the juxtaposition of old and contemporary photographs. Others try to emulate Cameron in this genre, but he is the master who makes it look easy."
4,STILL LOVE IT IN 2006!,"I really loved Immature when I was a young teen. I purchased this album about 3 years after it came out and I haven't been disappointed since. It's good to know that you can buy an album and still enjoy it so many years later.Marques Houston has an amazing voice and this album proves just how great he was even back in '95. As someone already said, if you were an avid Immature fan, this album should already be in your collection. A true classic!My favorites:- Please Don't Go- Lover's Groove- Pager- Just a Little Bit- Feel The Funk"
3,girl calling,"the way they used that chocolate milk sample on we got it is okay but I love the way WC used the sample on his cd earlier that year and looks like the boys was into some funk cause they covered mother's finest classic ballad love changes I prefer the original though still for immaturte, or whatever they call themselves now this is for you."
4,Excellent!!,"Actually this is not ""immature"" music at all, it's actually very mature with excellent rhythm and blues mixes, soulful songs, great singing and backup vocals.CHRIS STOKES is their manager and producer and he has DUPLICATED THE SUCCESS OF IMMATURE who released 5 cd's, WITH HIS EVEN MORE SUCCESSFUL BOY BAND: B2K.Manager C. Stokes has proven many times that he KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING.The best tracks on here are: PAGER, FEEL THE FUNK, BOY LIKE ME, PLEASE DON'T GO...and CAN'T STAND THE RAIN.THIS IS HIGH QUALITY soul music mixed with a little hip-hop and they always give you MORE THAN JUST TWO GOOD SONGS ON THEIR CD'S.The production is equal to the very best producers in R&b;."
5,"Man, Memories!!!","This album a freakin' classic. It's filled with so much feelings, It makes you feel sad, happy, and in love. Immature/IMx are some talented dudes that don't get much respect in the music game. ""We Got It"" all the way to ""Feel the Funk"", this album is flawless. I think they were like 14 when this album dropped and, by the sound of this album it makes you feel like they were much older. Don't know why they were called Immature because they music was so mature. I love this album"
2,Cracked,"when i received the ""we got it"" cd by immature the entire case was cracked and so i had to send it as a gift in its cracked state and wasnt too happy about that..."
2,Roudned bottom.,"The bottles are durable and have endured quite a lot of play and subsequent abuse from my daughter. In that alone, this is worth a few stars. My one complaint, and its a big one, is that the bottom is rounded and not flat. The bottles won't stand upright on any surface no matter what you do."
2,"an odd, light blue light.","Works as described, but the light is an off color. Don't plan on using in any place that friends can see the light. A closet or drawer will be okay, but not for under the sink (the place I bought them for)."
5,Perfect -- expecially for theme wedding and baby showers,"These exquisite pastel-tinted cupcake cups are wonderful for use when throwing themed parties for girl friends, particularly wedding and baby showers. You can make cupcake batter that's either dark or light, then pour it into the cups, then bake the whole get-up in the oven without any problems. If you buy the cups early enough, you can advise on the invitation for attendees to wear clothing of the same colors, and you can acquire decorative flower arrangements also matching the colors. Everyone tires of the same old brown or white or wax-paperish cupcake cup. If you'll get this pastel variety, it'll make your party a smashing success. (And don't forget theme hats to, adhering to the pastel color scheme!)"
2,Disappointingly clumsy,"Oh dear, I really wanted to like this book but found the writing so clunky and haphazard (slipping in and out of the child's POV and vocabulary) that it was hard to finish. The only reason I gave it any stars at all was that Riley's self-acceptance and the explanation he ultimately came up with for his situation were lovely and touching.By then, however, the story was poisoned by her casual racism--which then Byrd compounds by creating some racist characters, who at least are more open and self-aware about it than Byrd herself! There's just no excuse for perpetuating the negative stereotypes about African-Americans; it's as if Byrd really thinks they're all welfare queens, ex-cons and dialect-spouting orderlies."
2,Sad,"The childhood tragedy of the story pulled me into a read, but the writing is not very good. It is exhausting as prose. It is one of those stories that makes you feel guilty for not liking it, as if you're not being generous. The writer clearly had been throuhg the terrible tragedy with her own child, and that is very sad for her and of course her child. If she's going to write about this, however, I shouldn't feel any more guilty to say I didn't like how it was told if she's all right with using it as material."
2,I wanted to like this book...,"but was confused by the run-on thoughts and ideas. Most of the AA characters are portrayed in a negative light, which only distracted from the story. Riley's Fire needed a talented editor to make it shine. The ending left me with many questions, and wishing this had been a better book."
2,Trite,Characters weren't developed and story lacked interest. Such a shame considering the possibilities of a story like this.
4,Warm and wonderful,"Despite the sad subject and setting of this book, I felt uplifted by young Riley's spirit and his acceptance of his life and the people in it. I loved his little-boyness; for me, Byrd's Riley is one of the best drawn child characters since the children in To Kill A Mockingbird. Others characters were interesting or disturbing; I'd surely love to see a sequel to Riley's Fire. The ending was a bit too much of a surprise for me, but a surprise, nonetheless!"
5,Are you guys a band or a camp?,"Exactly why haven't you purchased this CD? Here are ten reasons: (1) You can learn how to make Tessfaye muffins. (2) Some proceeds will help to rearrange the liquid monkey. (3) Mr Canoe (4) Everybody likes monkeys - don't you? (5) People used to dress up like Ernie excapt without any clothes on and go to their concerts. (6) Lightning Hellfire Chuck Wren! (7) Swamp Daddy is in Mexico. (8) They are going to play a reunion show any day now. We swear. (9) What to you may seem abnormal is to them just a way of life. (10) One time, I was playing musical chairs with a bunch of little children and I used Big House and they all liked it and were dancing around and having fun and it was really neato. Yeah. This is seriously a great CD and I think you ought to at least consider it. You won't be able to find it many other places..."
5,ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING,"Read EVERYTHING Josie LItton writes. She is unmatched in her skill to grab you and not let go. You will smell, hear, see and definately wish you could touch everything her characters experience. ALL of her trilogies are magnificent."
4,Come Back To Me,"This was the last book in the trilogy, I loved the story and hearing follow up from the previous books. So many others don't catch you up from previous stories. The second in this trilogy felt a bit far fetched for me but it was still well written and left me hoping in the end. A definite must have."
3,Ok.,These strings are good but some of the strings were already bent up when i opened the package they just popped out. strings 1-3 were bent.
3,Chicken treats are STINKY!,My dog loved these treats but be aware that the Chicken treats reek! You must make sure the bag stays closed and always wash your hands right after touching them. You certainly don't want to walk around with these in your pocket. We didn't purchase these from Amazon but price is about what we paid.
1,They sound great but...,"They smell HORRIBLE! I bought a bag of these, expecting them to smell like chicken but instead I got a huge whiff of some gross chemical smell. I didn't even give them to my dogs because I felt like the smell was just too wrong. Call me crazy but ""natural"" dog treats shouldn't smell like chemicals at all. Plus, what the heck are all of the chemical names at the end of the ingredients list? Doesn't sound very natural to me.I think I'll be sticking with Natural Pups since their treats actually smell like the flavors they're supposed to be and they're way healthier."
1,all the dogs refused them.,"We have two dogs and they did not like these treats at all. We tried all the dogs in the neighborhood and out of 14 dogs o.ly two dogs liked the treats. One the other hand, all the dogs loved mellow mutt treats."
2,They smell horrible.,I literally almost throw up everytime I open the bag. I figured I'd give these a shot because they are all natural blah blah blah. My dog doesn't seem to care for these over any other treat and the only difference to me isother treats don't make me gag! I'm sticking to beggin strips.
1,Mini is the appropriate word,"These LITTLE ""treats"" are small enough for a mouse - not Pomeranians and Shih Tzu!! These would barely fill one of the back teeth of the dogs."
3,This shippment was stale,I have ordered this product many times and the product was as fresh as can be. This time they was very old and hard. My poor little diabetic dog with 6 teeth finds it hard to chew them. I will try again because of the great priceing. I have them on auto delivery! I called the manufacture. But they never returned my call. I can hardly believe that.
4,Dog loves Zuke's,"One of my Corgi's favorite treats. They are already small but are soft so are easy to rip into even smaller bits. The only issue I have with them and this may not apply to you, but my dog (medium sized, 25lb) does not chew these - he swallows them whole."
4,a tip for keeping zukes fresh on the go,TIP: My little guy really loves the Zukes Mini peanut butter treats. I always keep a little stash with me wherever we go; I keep them soft and fresh by using a contact lens container to hold the treats. Fits *anywhere* and seals tightly so no smells and they stay fresh. Easy to refill. Only holds a little but but a small portion is all we need.
4,Finally a natural treat that my Rottie loves,"Zuke's Mini Naturals Dog Treats Roasted Chicken Recipe, 16-OunceOur six year old Rottweiler is an extremely picky eater for some reason and we've gone through no less than six different brands of treats over the past year and this finally hit the spot.We changed from mass produced big brand treats to healthier natural ones about a year ago and maybe it's just me but I see a real difference in energy when playing. He simply loves these. They are pricey so we tend to be less ready to give treats but when we do it's great. I'm almost tempted to try one.Very pleased with the response thus fur. Will be getting more soon."
2,Picky terrier,"This might be one of the most liked dog treats, but my dog hated it.She licked it, put it in her mouth, and spat it right out.It smells really bad too. I had it in an airtight ziplock bag, but the smell was so strong, my whole car smelled like it the rest of the day.I guess I'll donate it to the shelter or something..."
5,Good til the last treat,"Usually I don't write reviews, but who really does unless the product is either outstanding or absolutely horrible. Thankfully this review is not the latter. When I initially got my puppy she was not house-trained, didn't know any tricks and was not food motivated. However, with these treats she was potty-trained and knows quite a few tricks. It was effort on my part, but those treats were definitely a good motivator. Also, looking around at other treats and their prices these are a really great value. If you want something that your dog will enjoy and a great value for the amount and type of treat this is what you want to look for. You and your dog won't be disappointed. I know mine isn't."
5,great training tool,"I use these to train my dog. As others have pointed out, they smell awful. Dogs love them though. Not a lot of calories so you don't have to worry about your dog getting fat and sluggish either. In fact, I break them up into two parts to get the most out of the bag."
4,My Dogs Love them!,"Both of my English Bulldogs love them!! They are a great size for training, however they are a little more chewy than I thought they would be. The 1 lb. bag is a great size and a great value. I will be ordering more!"
2,he loves them... but he gets the runs :(,My 55pound pitt mix has been able to eat nearly anything till now. After all the good reviews I gave them a try. He loves them (like anything else which is in a plastic thing) but he gets the runs shortly after getting 4 or 5 of them... pity
5,My dogs loved these treats!,"I highly recommend these dog treats!! Both of my dogs loved these treats. They would do just about anything to have these treats. They really do not smell good to me, but luckly I don't have to eat them!Zuke's Chicken-Flavored Mini Naturals Dog Treats, 16 Ounces"
2,Mini Naturals are just okay,My big puppy is not impressed. He'll ignore a palm-full and go about his business. Maybe he just isn't big on peanut butter flavor stuff.
5,My tiny dog loves Zuke's treats !!!,My tiny Maltese dog loves these treats and they are perfect for training sessions. They are small/miniature treats and about the consistancy of a 'slim jim' jerky stick for humans. Best treats I have found for toy dogs that don't crumble.
5,Work like a charm,"I purchased the peanut butter treats. My goldendoodle seems to really enjoy them. The only drawback is that they do dry out quickly, so keep the bag sealed."
2,My daughter calls them Pukes...Bring the nose plugs,I applaud the use of natural ingredients but that's where the applause stops... The smell is unbelievably bad ( Salmon) and my dog who is a treat nut is not too crazy about them either. Honestly they just smelled like rotting fish.
5,GRRRRRR-ATE!,"My rottweiler-mix loves these treats! Each morsel is about the size of your pinky fingernail, so these treats are perfect for training. It's a struggle to keep my big girl svelte. I don't have to break the treats in half, and I can give her these treats without worrying that she'll turn into a sausage. Because she likes them so much, I never feel like I'm depriving her. The bag is re-sealable and keeps the treats soft. If the treats happen to dry out, just put a moist paper towel in the bag, and they will re-absorb the moisture."
2,not for spoiled/finicky dogs who prefer stella and chewys,"as a new dog owner, i made the mistake of feeding my dog super-premium, filler-free raw food and treats from stella and chewys since she was a pup. But because of the high price of Stella and Chewys, i switched to the Zukes mini chicken treats. My mini dachshund turned her nose up at the treats, over and over. Even with nothing else to eat in the home, she actually preferred gnawing on her deer antler over the Zuke's.i'm not saying that these treats are bad at all---but it may be a waste of money for overindulged dogs with ""caviar tastes"" that have been spoiled by their owners (especially small companion dogs)."
2,gave my dog the runs,"the ingredients and reviews for these treats seem great, but they gave my dog the runs. (peanut butter) Every dog is different, I guess. These treats are also not grain free, if that's important to you."
4,Zukes Mini Naturals Dog Treats,"These treats are tiny and GREAT for training--low calorie, yet so aromatic that my dog jumps for joy as he smells them. The customer service was great, except they back-ordered one package of the treats, assured me they should be here in a few weeks; I've been waiting a month for the item."
5,Good treats!,"Our puppy loves these little treats! They are small enough to give him a few at a time, but I like to cut them up even smaller and use them for training. They are tiny as is (about the size of a pencil eraser), but can easily be cut into quarters for reward-based training. I will always keep these in stock for him!"
5,We call it doggie crack.,I think the title explains it. We cut it into quarters and use it for rewarding our puppy while we train it. Took us 24 hours to teach a 8 week puppy to use the outdoor for relieving itself. The dog will do anything for a reward.Do be careful in how you store it as it will dry out if exposed to too much air.
2,Not for my spoiled dog,My dog wouldn't eat any of treats.She is very picky.Gave them to my daughter for her two dogs and she said they ate them .
5,My dog loves them!,I only feed my dog organic products and treats and I love the ingredients in these treats. They are perfect for training and she loves them!
1,Zero stars if I could,"Less than 24 hours after my four year old dog ate a Zuke's ""all-natural"" bone, she developed pancreatitis!!! There was no other change in her diet, environment or anything but that Zuke's bone. When I took her to the vet, she was dehydrated from vomiting and diarrhea... and she had to stay at the vet for three days. Over $1,000 in vet bills later, I gave Zuke's hq a call to let them know. While symphathetic, basically Zuke's gave me a $15 check to cover the cost of the bone, but failed to take responsibility for the incident, even though the vet wrote a note saying the bone was the most likely cause. Stay away from this and all Zuke's ""all-natural"" products!"
4,My dog liked them,"She ate them gladly, every time. My dog doesn't have any food allergies though, so I switched back to whatever is on sale at the local store. If you need Naturals or are looking for a Natural diet, these seem to be a good value."
2,Not worth it,very expensive for the size of the bag. my dog loved the treats but they hardened up really fast. would not buy again.
3,Its okay.,"I thought 16 ounce was a lot but the quantity wasn't to my expectations. My dog loves the treat but for 9$ I believe there's more treats that are less pricey and more quality that you can just look for in your local pet shops. The treat itself is literally MINI as in the size of a treat is similar to the size of your fingernail. If you got a small dog or miniatures, this treat is preferable but again the price isn't too good, size isn't fit for normal-big dogs (i feed my 30-35 lb dog two at a time) but quality is great."
4,ZUKE'S MINI ROASTED CHICKEN RECIPE DOG TREATS,"BOTH OF OUR DOGS LIKE THIS TREAT; SOMUCHSO, THE YOUNGER ONE WOULD VERY OFTEN TRY TO STEAL SAME FROM THE OLDER ONE."
4,Great treat!,"This is a good treat for my toy poodle who is 3 months old. She loves it a lot but only thing I can comment here is it is better buying it from Petsmart because it's moist a bit and the package I bought in Amazon seller is a dry, bit harder and flaky. I flet like it's old but expires in 2014. Maybe the seller stores it some place that makes it dry.Salmon recipe is good too!"
3,Eh.,"I wanted my pup to love these. He is a 11 week old Yorkshire Terrier and he doesn't seem too interested in them...Maybe he will when he a bit older? I dk...I mean, the product itself seems great...but my pup just doesn't like em'!"
5,great little treat,"These treats are made from high quality ingredients, and are made in the U.S.A.(two things I look for). They are the perfect training treat, low in calories, small enough to carry in a pocket. I use them daily as a ""reward"" for proper behavior. My cavaliers absoultely adore these treats, they are by far their favorite."
5,oh boy ... mr. bear devours these things!!,My buddy bear is in love with these little snacks. He gets all excited every time he sees me going for the bag!! He loves em!
5,"I think they're bland, but my puppy loves them","The aroma of these treats is fantastic--there's a tantalizing meaty, smokey smell that wafts from the bag. And the texture of the treats are pleasingly soft and moist. Unfortunately, I was a little disappointed when I tried them. I think they are rather bland, and because they are coarsely ground there are hard bits of stuff in them, one of which got caught between my teeth. I think they could have used a little bit more salt. Also, they're a little small so it takes a lot to fill me up.On the other hand, my puppy loves these things and they have been great motivators for teaching her tricks, so I guess they have that going for them."
1,My dog doesn't like them!,"My yellow lab, who loves any and all food, does not like these! I get them out and she doesn't come running, so that's the perfect indication. I pull out some other snacks to lure her into her crate and she bounds in - but not with these!"
5,The best!,"This is the perfect treat: small (so your dog doesn't get fat), extremely healthy, and very fairly priced (especially per treat--about 2 cents a treat. Oh yes, and my dog loves it."
5,Great for stuffing toys!,"These little treats are terrific. My dog loves them and can spend a long time digging them out from a toy I stuff with these. Also great for training, as you can really dish out a lot of them. Unlike some other reviewers, I find the smoky smell apealing for myself as well (I use the chicken flavor)"
5,Girls go wild for Zuke's dog treats,"My two ""girls"" love these training treats. I was looking for AKC liver training treats and couldn't find it for a while so I ordered these. I now have ""fans"" in my household."
5,Great Treats,I love these treats they are great for training. I also put them in the treat ball to keep my dog occupied while I am not home. They are the perfect size for all my treat balls. And the price was great.Thanks
5,"semi-moist, tiny training treats","Win-win solution for training treats when I forgot to make a new batch. These are semi-moist so the dog doesn't have to chew them, and he loves them so they do make working worth it for our dog."
3,good treats but dog did not like them much,"My dog liked the smell of these at first and got really excited, but she got bored after just a couple of these treats. I had to use them as filler treats during training to get rid of them. I will not buy these again, since she doesn't like them, but the treats themselves are good, healthy and low-calorie."
2,Dog doesn't like them,"My maltipoo is pretty picky with food and treats and she absolutely hates these treats. I've tried offering them to her and she won't eat it. I tried putting them in her food and she'll just pick around it. I've only tried peanut butter and salmon. I bought all three flavors. I plan on trying the chicken one soon to see if she likes that one, but I don't think it'll win her over"
1,We threw them out! Don't tell Uncle Jeff!,"Our 55lb dog ""Panama"" got these as a gift from family at Christmas. He couldn't barf them out quick enough! The strange thing about it is that they went in as small little treats but when they came back out they were all bound together into large balls of goo... In a considerable number of the reviews here it was noted that the dogs wouldn't eat them, I'd trust those instincts!"
1,i wasn't,I have a shih tzu Chihuahua mix and he will not eat these. I was surprised since they got great reviews..maybe my moms cat will eat them.
2,Puppy doesn't like,"For whatever reason, my puppy is not interested in these treats. I thought they would be perfect for training based on their size, but my beagle mix wants nothing to do with them."
5,Great treats!,My dog loves these! I really like the tiny size of them which make them perfect for training. We will definitely be trying other Zuke's treats too!
4,Great for training,"My 4 month old puppy loves these. I agree with the other reviewer that they do tend to dry out fast so I recently ordered the PB kind to see if they stay soft longer. Of course, if you keep them in the package or a ziplock, they don't dry out, but when I'm training with them and have them in my pocket, they do start to get dry.Training has been great with these treats. My dog is very responsive and I know I can use a lot of them without any upset GI issues as they're healthy for him too!"
5,Cheap and Tasty!,"I used to give my 7 month Lab mix puppy Blue Buffalo Bits but I stopped because of the price and this resulted to be a great substitute! These are a whole lot cheaper - I paid about $7 for a 1lb bag of treats and my puppy enjoys them. They are a little ""greasy"" but that's expected since they are 'moist'. I usually train my puppy with a mix of kibble, biscuits and cut up greenies and this is a great addition to the mix."
5,My dogs love them!,I have two puppies-a mini doxie and a toy poodle. They go crazy over these. I love that they are low calorie and are made with healthy ingredients.
5,He loves them,My dog loves them. What more can I say? The 1 pound bags seem to be the most affordable option.
4,A Great Training Treat,"My dog has agility training two days a week, so we are always trying new treats for her to assit in motivating. We use the Zukes on a semi regular basis. I like it because it is easy to tear the treats down to smaller sizes to make the product last. The treat is semi smelly which is good because it helps focus are dog.The reason for the 4 stars is that my dog is very picky and she will defintilty try harder for certain treats. She does like the Zukes but she does respond better to more raw types of meat treats that we get at a specialty dog store."
5,Great Training Treat,My dogs loves these soft and stinky treats! They are great for training because they are small enough you can give a lot of them and not be concerned about giving your dog to much food. They also have healthy ingredients and are one of the treats my sensetive GSD can have =0)
1,Smelled Awful & Dog Wouldn't Eat,"I purchased the chicken flavor. When I opened the bag, the smell was very unpleasant.I offered one to my dog and he wouldn't eat it. The entire contents went into the trash."
1,Why dogs won't eat them.,"My pomeranian is 11 and will eat any treats. Heck, she eats more produce than most people do. So we bought the duck jerky and peanut butter bits. She won't touch either one. Now, she has never been given duck food so I'm not shocked that she wouldn't put it in her mouth, but she eats peanut butter like crazy. So, I looked at the ingredients and both packages contain tumeric, rosemary, and sage. I think that the seasoning may be what turn many dogs off. My dog won't eat seasoned meat. I'm not positive that this is the problem, or everyone's problem, but I don't see any other ingredients that would turn off dogs. Our pet supply store gave us a full refund and we chose another treat that she goes crazy over."
4,Dogs loved them!,"Got these as a training treat for on the go with the dogs. Dogs loved them, good size for training!"
5,a stinky teat my Bella loves,"they are tiny and stinky but my Bella just loves them. she will do anything for them, sit, lay jump play dead and she is only ten weeks old. in fact I put them in a glass candie jar and when she sees me reach into it she starts her tricks before i even ask. try a small bag they are great for training"
4,"My dog loves them , but...","I have a medium sized dog (Corgi-Golden mix), and while these treats are one of my dog's favorites, they ARE mini...very mini. Unless you have a Teacup, plan on giving more than one at a time."
5,Dog LOVES them,"My dog absolutely goes crazy for these treats, and he's a picky Weim. They seem to last a long time by only giving a handful or so at a time. I have purchased multiple flavors and he likes them all so far. These are definitely going to be his staple dog treat, and I can even mix them in with his dog food when he doesn't seem to be interested in it. It makes him actually eat dry dog food that otherwise he would avoid.These are highly recommended, and I suggest you try it for yourself to be sure."
3,I'm sure they are good treats but my dog just didn't like them.,I bought these because I liked the fact that they were small and were intended to be used to train my dog. For some reason he just didn't like them. They also get hard pretty quickly.
3,Dog Loves Treats but Bad for His Teeth,"My dog loves this treat and it's great for training and teaching tricks. I would not recommend them if you have a small dog prone to dental decay. After going through many bags of these treats I learned that small dogs prone to dental problems should not have soft or sticky treats because they may promote dental problems. I did not know this and he recently had to have 7 teeth pulled. I don't think it was entirely the fault of this particular treat but a combination of problems, but I think it could have been a factor. Overall, these are great for training."
3,"good for dogs, bad for your nose","great treat, dog loved em, small and good for training. but they smelled pretty bad. we got the salmon and the chicken and both had an offensive odor. won't buy again for that reason."
4,Perfect size but smells less than perfect,"My 5 month old Lab mix enjoys these treats (but he seems to enjoy any food) and I love the small size since we're still training him. The smell isn't so great so you can't just stash a handful in your pocket unless you want your pocket to smell like them. I knocked off 1 star in my rating just because of the smell, but if you keep the bag sealed at all times, you won't smell anything and it will keep the treats fresh. I found the same item at my local pet store in NYC (Tribeca area) for $1 less than Amazon so I was a bit shocked that it's cheaper there than Amazon."
5,His second favorite flavor....,He really loves these treats more than any other treats out there. He flips backwards just to get these LOL. These are a just a little bigger than a pencil eraser. They are great for training. I like to cut them in half to yield even more. I tried cutting them in quarters but they seem a little too small for my dogs big mouth. They come in a resealable package so that helps to keep them nice and fresh and especially soft. I forgot to close the bag one day and the treats got pretty hard but the dog didn't mind.
4,Perfect for Training,"These are the perfect size for my dog when I'm trying to train him. They're so small you don't have to break them up, and they're very soft so it's a quick reward. The only downside: the smell. It's not too strong, but when I open the bag it smells pretty bad for a while. He doesn't seem to mind though, he loves them."
4,"Joey Molland's Badfinger release, not the original","This is another packaging release of the same Cd that must have 5-6 different covers by now. This is not the original band of Badfinger, it is Joey Molland who back in 1994 went to Nashville & re-recorded all of these songs. He sang on all of them, which as you know he did not do on the original Badfinger songs. He is not the singer Tom & Pete were by anymeans. It doesn't list any session players at all. I dont know if the drums are real or not. But alot of folks dont like this release as it is misleading by using the name Badfinger. It is not an expensive Cd, & I've always liked it. The songs are all good that were played, spanning alot of there career. At least on this release the only photo on the cover is of Joey."
5,The Cd is very unique and Ricky Martin is very creative.,The CD is very creative and has alot feeling. The music justs make you wanna get up and dance. You feel as if the music is controling you.
5,The Bunjee venture,"The Bunjee Venture by Stan Mc Murty is a weird and funny book. Karen and Andy's dad is always making weird inventions. When their dad tries to make time machine, he tries it and gets sent to prehistoric times. His kids try to rescue him. They made a time machine and also go back to prehistoric times. When get arrive they meet a bunjee. They go down a river and get rescued by their dad who takes them back to our time. (spoiler)"
5,excellent condition,"OMG!I can't get enough of my man Marty! If he hadn't passed on, I would have stolen him from Marizona! Seriously, Marty was a wonderful man, so sad his life was cut so short. I don't think he realized the severity of his health problems, but he said he was going to get as much out of his life as he could, because you don't know how many minutes you have on this earth. Ronny said, ""Daddy probably lived 90 yrs. in the 57 yrs. he was alive and I believe he couldn't have summed it up in any better words."
2,opinions,"The CD I'm about to talk about is ""Blazing Hot"", by Nice and Smooth. I thought this CD was the absolute worse out of all their albums. The only tracks worth listening to is ""Let it Go"", ""Boogie Down Bronx/BK connection"", and ""Blazing Hot."" I would only recommend you buying this if you're a real hardcore fan."
1,Useless and overpriced,"This is not a book on weight loss surgery and dealing with post-op life, this is a ""book"" (more like a long winded pamphlet)about a woman venting about her feelings. You know, kudos for her and her success, but WLS patients need something a little more ""solid""...not just random rambling. I'm 10 months post-op, at goal, size 8 now and man, did this book NOT help me in anyway except to waste money. I can't wait until Lenore writes her book :) Now that'll be a good read.Don't waste your money...even Carnie's book has more substance. And WHAT is with the blank pages?"
4,A wake-up call,Prepares you for an extraordinary journey ahead. The insights in this book are more than simply helpful. They are astonishing in their clarity and in their value. In less than an hour of reading your whole view on bypass surgery can change. I read this book to support my wife in her decision to lose weight. No regrets.
2,Big Disappointment,"I had great hopes for this book, but I found it to be very disappointing. Uninformative and lacking in substance. There are much better books out there on this subject. Also, the font is so big and there are so many blank pages is this book that it reminded me of a high school book report, faking its way to a higher number of pages. Overpriced too."
2,Not worth the money,I was looking for information on the gastric by pass surgery. Instead what I got was chapters of individuals experiences and problems and successes. I wanted info to reference for myself. Would like to send it back.
1,Absolutely Horrible!,"This book is so disappointing! It is terribly written, much more like a pamplet than a book. There is so little information that the book contains a 2 inch margin at the top and bottom of every page, plus repeats the complete name of the book and author on every page, then also has many pages that are almost completely blank! The 107 pages could easily be covered in 25 pages, but even then it would not be worth reading!"
5,the patient's book,"The focus is on achieving a balance between mind, body and spirit. This book is inspirational and practical. It's the patient's book written by a patient for a patient."
4,Never Too Late To Learn,It's never too late to learn something no one ever taught you. There is no price placed on enlightenment. I read this book twice. The second time I got it. If you didn't get it. Go back. It's worth the second read.
1,Needed a proofreader!,"It is unfortunate that Holtzclaw's important message is lost in such a mess. The main problem with this book is that it is so riddled with spelling, gramatical and punctuation errors, that it is impossible to read without becoming irritated. Did she not have an editor? Didn't anyone bother to actually read through the manuscript before sending it off to a printer? Also, there is not enough substance here for a book in the first place and the author ends up saying the same things over and over again to fill up the pages. I found this to be a very frustrating read on many levels and I'm sorry I wasted my money on such an amateur effort!"
1,I Hate to be the Odd Guy Here But...,"I found this book to be of absolutely no use to me or others that are post-gastric bypass. There are many emotional issues that must be resolved in order to ""heal"" after surgery and I must report that I found that this ""easily read in 20 minutes"" book to be no assistance in attempts to help in the development of tools for long term coping. I do, however thinkg that the writing of the book was probably extrememly therapeutic for the author and she should definitely be commended on her tremendous progress. Her writing does indeed evidence her healthy recovery and obvious use effective coping skills in her lifelong battle with obesity. I did not read ""This is not Brain Surgery"" but I must say that the title of that book pretty much says it all. Oh, I had gastric bypass on 4-23-01 and have lost 145 lbs and am currently within 10 lbs of my goal weight! Thanks for allowing me to express."
4,Inexpensive but does the job,Was looking for a priority stamp for work. The company we order from wanted 3 times what this seller had the product for. It works perfectly fine and does the job. Every aspect of the transaction from price to delivery of the item was great.
2,Unimpressive,"They just made large patterns. Some nice ones, but not necessarily flatterng or slimming. Some were downright ugly and old-ladyish. Check the library!"
2,Style at Large:Knitting Designs for Real Women,"The instructions and diagrams were very clear and easy to follow. The patterns however, were not very attractive. To my eye, they look cumbersome and not very flattering."
3,"Good Knitting Tips, So-So Styles","Pros: The section on knitting hints and techniques is very good. There are some suggestions for handling necks and picking up stitches I hadn't seen elsewhere. I gave three stars based on this. The models are genuinely plus-size, and have a variety of skin tones.Cons: The author has a preference for ""fuzzy"" yarns like chenille and mohair that I don't share. The sweaters all have a rectangular, straight-up-and-down line that doesn't work for me (I'm a ""pear."") Also, all the styles have dropped shoulders, and the sleeves seem to drape badly, with a lot of fabric bunching under the arm. It looks lumpy and maybe even uncomfortable. Lastly, the subtitle is ""Knitting Designs for Real Women."" Sorry to quibble, but slender women are ""real,"" too."
2,Toshiba do not support region free machines,"Take care, any Toshiba DVD player that is region free will not be replaced by Toshiba even if it goes wrong within a year. Toshiba will not handle any machines other than Region 1 and will tell you to contact the supplier for a replacement."
1,My home movies are better than this - chances are yours are too,"A five star rating for this???? After three minutes it was pretty obvious the actors and crew had stuffed the ballot box. Might be funny to you guys but because of that rating I paid money to see this. Though I am a patient and forgiving man, I was not able to make it past half way. If anyone can actually endure this production in one sitting, I'd like to shake their hand. After three tries I threw in the towel and deleted the remains."
4,funny story about an old illness,"A cute rhyming story about Goldie Locks when she comes down with chicken pox. Plenty of funny twists and clever rhymes, but the subject matter is becoming less familiar. Although when the book was first published in 2002, chicken pox was still pretty common, it has become less and less so now that most kids are immunized. Soon, writing a children's story about chicken pox will be like writing a children's story about measles. Children will recognize the name of the disease because of the immunization, but they will not relate to spots, bumps or illness."
5,"A wonderful, colorful story","My kids were both traumatised by Chicken pox, and this has enabled them to laugh about the whole experience. It is a very clever rhyming book which kids of all ages will love and the reference to other nursery rhymes makes it a throughly entertaining read."
4,Some Good Ideas!,"I like that the authors don't just make suggestions but also give ideas on how to incorporate them into your daily life so you develop new good habits, some of the information is not new to me but I did get a couple of good ideas I can use..."
5,Great Sci-Fi!!,This is a great Sci-fi about a young doctor and her relationship with an android.It's a must see!!
4,"decent product, no SPF though.","I picked this up at the store a couple of months ago, and it works well. I does have a nice light scent initially, and it sooths the face. It does not have any SPF though, so in summer I used a different balm. But it has been good this winter. Check it out."
3,Lost a little steam,"Hey, I'm a huge fan of Amis...""Time's Arrow"" is one of my absolute favorites. That being said, personally the story lost me a little after the brothers achieved ""freedom."" All the horrific, detailed accounts of times in the prison camp were making up to a wonderfully interesting novel for me. Once they were out, I think it lost a little steam. Overall, a great book...just not enough for 4 stars."
2,Meandering and pretentious,The story had promise but I don't appreciate the author's deliberate obtuseness. There is too much literary pedantry and not enough substance to this book.
1,Verbose,Why use few syllables when you can use many? Why use common words when you can use rare ones? Why write simply when you can write in a convoluted style? The main character is plastic. It's as if Amis created him for the sole purpose of having a vessel from which to pour his pretentions and 10 cent words.
4,5 Things about House of Meetings,"1. Terrible conditions make for terrible men.2. In House of Meetings, the unnamed protagonist is a soldier, a rapist, a brute, and a victim of the gulag system in Russia.3. Petty jealousies between brothers, unrequited desire and the violence done in the name of it, and the harsh cold winters overshadow - or augment - the horrors of the gulag.4. In this novel, much as in Ha Jin's War Trash, the terrible whole of the prison system is described in the minute details of daily politics, meaningless violence, and the back roads to morality that one takes to survive.5. House of Meetings is tautly written, with devastating observations about Soviet Russia, present-day America, and the nature of growing old with unforgivable memories."
1,not quite what you see,the product may be great But the picture is not true. You only get the bench. I wanted what was in the picture. Priced it out close to $500 I would have to order else where too I believe. I did not purchase I will find something else. To me its miss leading
1,Tarnishing the Trophies,"A generally quick and easy-reading overview of the lives of Palmer, Nicklaus, and Woods is ruined by the author's insistence of sticking racism and sexism in your face.Sounes uses a self-important journalistic style dripping with preconceptions. And this: A player uses a masturbatory grip on a golf club. Please ...Sounes is hip and investigative - OK, I got it. No wonder personalities in the limelight avoid characters like Sounes posing as authors who demand their time, then produce drivel like this."
3,Only One Knows,Only a racist can so incorrectly evaluate racism in golf and only a true sexist can incorrectly evaluate sexism in modern golf. Shame on Mr. Sounes for attempting to sully a great game with contrived evidence.
2,I get it.....,"The game of golf is racist and sexist. I get it. In fact, I got it after the first twenty times Sounes whines about it."
3,Interesting but tries too hard,"Some interesting stories on the business dealings of the Palmer, Nicklaus and Woods but I don't buy the agrguments regarding discrimination in the PGA. It is too easy to carve out one piece in the overall history of race relations and make Palmer and Nicklaus (and other major golfers) look bad for not leading the charge for change. Many American failed in this area.And why doesn't the author focus on Woods lack of involvement in making change? Woods is like Palmer and Nicklaus in their day - great golfers focused on their game."
2,Dissapointed,"Don't waste your time with this book. Not sure what the author had against Earl Woods, but he does not waste an opportunity to make him look bad. Several times the author points out inconsistencies in statements made by Earl Woods regarding his past. All I could think about was who cares? What does this have to do with the ""business of modern golf""? If you're interested in the relationship between Arnie and Jack (both in business and on the course) I would recommend ""Arnie and Jack"" by Ian O'Connor."
3,"Retro Rods, well sort of","OK book. Good pictures but a little bit of just an overview, not much in depth or history but enjoyable to browse. Some of the cars don't really fit the retro theme, too modern or mixed styles."
2,Sloppy and full of errors,"Hopefully a second edition is on the way, with the numerous mistakes corrected. Until then, I would stay away from this text. Besides outright errors, there are many places where the author is just not clear or contradicts herself, examples do not always agree with the text or are ambiguous, and captions are sometimes just plain wrong. I would venture to guess that this book was put together very quickly."
3,memoirs of lady hyegyong- interesting,"an interesting book. It makes the writings of a crown princess more informative and intense. I would recommend this book but readers might want to read a simpler version. The book is a little messy and isn't in the form of the beginning of the story to the end. Bits and pieces are told in different chapters.Overall, an interesting story."
4,Good but somethings could have been better organized,"I think Haboush was trying to adhere to the original piece how the Crown prince wrote it but the sequence of events perhaps could have been ordered better? Because they are divided into 4 sections and each memoir tells the same story in different perspective and you have to go back.Also some of the Korean names and terms I would have liked to have seen them typed both in Korean as well. It was had to make out what it meant.It clarified, especially the last memoir (1805) how and why Sado seja was killed. History often sites that It was his father's extreme dislike for that drove to it. He could not have been disposed because there would have been factions that would try to put him back up on the throne."
1,Beautiful but. . .,Nice ring of course or I wouldn't have bought it. . . But it was way overpriced.Wow... way over priced for the quality
5,Beautiful,"I love this ring. I got it for my Mom for Christmas and she fell in love with it.It feels very comfortable on the finger, because its flat. It looks like lace, very special ring, by the way it extends the appearance of your fingers. You will love it."
4,assertiveness training for kids,"nice resource for helping kids learn differences between being passive and aggressive, with a focus on good self-esteem and being assertive. use of characters is great because it helps kids have a visual reference point to remind them to stay on track by taking a path that's not at either extreme. it is an older book, and a newer, more updated version would be great."
1,Not for OS X on the Mac,"I was excited to purchase this game for my son. It looks to be a good product. It said it was OS X compatible, however, once I received the CD, it said ""OS X (classic)"" which I now take to mean OS 9. So, unfortunately it doesn't run on the current OS X operating system. I am frustrated that this requirement wasn't specified on the website so I would have known it couldn't run on my current computer. Beings how it was only $7, it isn't worthwhile to return the product, but it is frustrating that it was still $7 wasted."
3,Should've Paid More Attn,"You must have the CD in to play! Not very cool.Yeah, I should've paid more attention to the description. I'm really not interested in buying and owning software that is nearly a decade old. But alas..."
5,Library book==bl U e S--all the greats r here.,"GURALNICK-SANTELLI & FARLEY-11/2/2004--288 pgs.The BLUES was born in the SOUTH. A viable black folkmusic for decades.

3,"Interesting book, but where the heck is the index???","I thought this was a very entertaining book with good historical information as well as opinions and blues stories from people who lived or worked with the blues.The problem I had with this book started with how it was organized. It was not organized chronologically or by artist, but by article. Therefore, a particular artist could be mentioned in several articles in the book, but there was no index to look up which pages the artist was mentioned on!As an example, I wanted to know more about Elmore James, but unless I thumb through the book, page by page, there was no way to know where Elmore James was mentioned.This book did not have an index! Even with all of the good information, not having and index was a fatal flaw. I gave this book four stars for the information and two stars for being poorly organized and not having an index."
4,Design for Living Boxed Set,"Another cracking Reyne offering with a good mix of raucous (a la Aussie Crawl) rock and soulful balladeering! Some of the tracks 'borrow' a bit from previous numbers , but for James Reyne fans this is certainly worth adding to the collection! It would be great to see JR produce an album of ballads/love songs...as when he 'reins back'(excuse the pun) and goes for the softer vocals he can sing a really 'sweet' tune (like Reckless! )"
2,too big,"I'm sad to say we had to return this. There was no way to determine the size from the picture or the description. when it got here, it looked great as far as the leather goes but it didn't fit in my husbands pocket, that's a problem. Would have appreciate some sort or size scale."
1,Done in my fat cards and driver's license,"I finally got around to transfering my old wallet to my new wallet. Unfortunately, the card slots (and there are many) were about a 1/8"" to small to hold my cards and driver's license. Close ... so close, but now my well made wallet is useless. I have to buy another."
1,Not usable as described,"This item arrived on time, leather is soft and nice as described, but slots for credit card and driver's license were too small to be usable, I could not fit my cards in these slots -- too small. I am not sure if the manufacturing process is inconsistent or some other reason rendering the product useless. I had to return it."
3,"surprise, I'm Giant","The good news is this wallet is easy to organize for all your credit cards and cash, and there's plenty of space so your not playing find the card. But the bad news is this wallet isn't just big, its a monster, I got it for my husband for Christmas for the distinct reason its a zip up, and it quickly became the biggest bomb gift, everyone thought it was a joke. But should you not care about this being enormous, then this wallet is fine for you."
5,This cookbook is the most fun of any I've come across!,"This cookbook is wonderful! A joy to read, even if not cooking or looking up a recipe. A few of the items are a tad difficult to come by in my part of the world (Pickled Walnuts & Gentlemens Relish for example), but most of them are accessable, and I've made many of these recipes with great success. I highly recommend ""Devils on Horseback"" which gave me quite a reputation at work. Thanks Jennifer & Clarissa!"
2,Disappointment,"Read good reviews and articles in magazines, liked the idea, and what a disappointment. The music is nice, but then that voice! Horrendous! Also, why waste time, go back to the originals this band is copying: Tom Waits, Leon Redbone, Dan Hicks, Django, etc. The voice and delivery are supposed to be quirky and evoke the time period, but it's like nails on a blackboard."
2,Can you say spellcheck???,"I thought that the storyline was ok but there were too many typos and incorrect usage of words as such as the spelling of ""weak"" when they meant ""week"". I could see a few but the whole book is full of them and that gets irritating after awhile."
2,TOO MANY ERRORS,"This would of, could of ,should of been a good book... if it had been properly edited. It's like the editing team stopped half way through the book. Some of the mistakes are so bad that you have to go back and make sure you didn't miss something(the wrong guys name). It totally takes away from the book. It went from...this should be interesting, to not another mistake. Do yourself a favor, borrow this book. You'll give it a better chance if you don't feel that you gave your money to publishers who didn't care about their readers."
2,"We do speak English, don't we?","To read this book was a painful experience, for although the story was cute, but trite to say the least, the editing was horrendous. Mr. Gray writes a compelling piece of fiction, but I'm sure you could hire some English major at some university for what would seem to be a small task of correcting the grammar, punctuation and pronounciation (even your profane language could be ""cleaned up"" and set straight!) to make this a more enjoyable read. I certainly hope that future works are put through a more stringent editing than what was shown in this novel."
2,"So, so read...","...however, based on the title I was expecting more. AND DON'T LET THE COVER FOOL YOU!!!! The cover has changed (possible to generate sales) since I bought this DISAPPOINTING book.This book is essentially 2 separate tales...one involves 21 year old virginal Spanky on his quest to ""get some"" and 19 year old Shana is a self imposed ""round the way girl"".From the beginning you expect the 2 to become involved (hence the title ""Booty Call"")...but the 2 characters don't meet. 2 tales in one book about 2 characters that don't interact - yet alone exist in the other's world.Would suggest the author re-think his title choice - Spanky's not getting any and Shana is just another hootchie looking for a mark.Disappointing read...mad I wasted money on this. The best use for this book is as kindling for my fireplace. Definitely a disappointing read and not worth the money or time."
5,"Gray, Puts it down for coming of age story","Gray takes u into a world of young black adults in 2001. I though the separation of both characters lives was very high quality work. It just had a couple of grammar and writing errors, and a big snapfoo with the numbering of chapters but trust me it was still a overall great book. If your not that secure with reading about sex, this may not be the book for u if u care to try to break ur habit read it."
3,2 stories for the price of 1,You will read this book and love every minute of it. Shana is the high sexed young 19 y/o that puts herself in sticky situations. Spanky's story was more of comic relief with moralism at the same time. But I'm letting you know their is grammar errors and you will be confused by the missing chapter. But overall it was cool.
2,A booty call i wouldn't dial,well.. it started off very interesting. i thought i was going to be pleased. i was fooled. i did not like spanky's part at all. Shana's part was cool but thats it. the book was long and drawn out. the ending sucked.. this is the writers first book. i really hope Mr. Gray steps it up next time. does he deserve a second chance? you tell me.
5,Great Book!!,"This book was excellent....Having read the previous reader's comments before starting this book, I read the book character by character since most comments stated that Shana's story was definitely the best one. I started with Shana's story skipping over Spanky's all the way to the end. Then I read Spanky's story all the way to the end. This was a great way to read the story because after every chapter Gray always leaves a cliffhanger...and it was frustrating to continue w/ the other character's story w/o knowing what happened next:-)I couldn't wait to finish the stories. I could not put the book down at all! I was talking out loud and everything while reading it.I encourage everyone who likes drama and more drama to READ THIS BOOK!!"
3,great,good book very expensive annoying teacher didnt even use it that's how the publishers and professor make money with royalties on books they may only use a chapter
5,kingdom come at there finest,this is a must have for all kingdom come fans your collection is not complete with out this cd & its getting hard to come by. good work lenny wolf on this cd.
5,"Great, even for non-hot-tea drinkers!","I'm not a big fan of hot tea; if I must, it's usually just plain Lipton, and I distinctly dislike Earl Gray. So, if you have similar (dis)tastes, try this Red Tea. It's got a great flavor, more interesting than plain Lipton, but not too strong or tasting of flowers! I enjoy this tea with a small amount of milk, or plain... and I will confess I only tried it, initially, after reading Alexander McCall Smith's book, The Number One Ladies Detective Agency! Curiosity got me hooked on a tea that I actually like. I ordered from Amazon after my local store switched to a selection of Chai-flavored-frou-frou teas - I like to stick to the plain Kalahari Red."
2,I'm a sweet tea drinker,maybe that's why I didn't care for this Red Tea. I was hoping for something sweeter like Good Earth's Sweet and spicy red tea.
1,PARAMOUNT HAS MADE MORE EDITS ! ! ! !,"Paramount should not release DVD's anymore if they continue toedit them. ... This time they have edited the scene where the killer reads a letter in voice-over where he originally makes reference to raping a woman using a ""meat cleaver."" ...."
5,Movie,"Great movie, this was a gift and my sister loved it very much. It was not available in any of the video stores and it was wonderful to find it at Amazon.com and get it quickly delivered."
3,Not the original,"I will add another complaint about the editing of this film. The ""meat cleaver"" line was a genuine shocker at the time, but is certainly mild compared to what is seen and heard in films today, or heard in music, for that matter. Shame on Paramount for editing this movie in both the VHS and DVD versions."
1,I Like My Slashers Without The Marvin Hamlisch.,"This film is utter garbage. Trash is too elevated a word to describe this turgid slop. Everybody in this movie is dumb. The killer is dumb. His intended victims are dumb. The cops are dumb. Michael Biehn poorly tries to channel Travis Bickle in his account of a psychotic star worshipper. Fortunately he had a career after appearing in this swill. What dumbfounds me is how so many talented people agreed to appear in this crud. Did they really think this would be the last paycheck they would ever draw? Do they really want this to be on their epitaphs? Betty, Bogie is rolling around in his grave!"
2,Too old!!!!,"This is a too old book! But I did like the little history in the last pages about the different dances, not just tap dancing."
1,A two star book with a troubling section,"The novel is not much to consider. It seems too constructed and the technique of osciallating between first- and third-person narrative seems too gimmicky. But I have to take issue with a poem in the book supposedly written by the narrator in the late 1960s. It is way WAY too close to Michael Ondaatje's poem, ""The Cinnamon Peeler"" and Lightman owes an apology or an explanation."
5,Very handy for me,"This box has four sections in each box, and one box for each day of the week. All sections fit snugly into one larger carry box. The sections are kinda small, about 1"" L x 3/4"" w X 1/4"" D, but they need to be to fit neatly in the carrier. The lids can be a little hard to pop open at first but they've loosened up.I gave it five stars mostly because it's comvenient to carry and won't pop open in your pocket or luggage (or purse, I imagine).I don't think that ten bucks is a lot."
2,G-MISREPRESENTATION,"I got this watch in 2007. For two and a half years it worked wonderfully. Then, after the second year, the alarm stopped working. Turning on the backlight made the numbers disappear. Took it to a repair shop, they told me it'd cost $140 to fix. More than the price of the watch. I've always taken the utmost care of this watch, never took it swimming or diving. Most I did with it was jog and go to work. It's ben a waste of money. First of all, the ten year battery doesn't actually last ten, or even five, years. Secondly, if the battery did in fact last ten years, wouldn't you expect the watch to last at lest half as long? There's a lot of fine print you ned to read. All in all, I would have been better off with a $20 Timex. $20 is all you should spend on a Casio. Or for something really good and flashy, I' get a seiko or citizen for a couple hundred bucks. Stay away from this garbage."
3,Sad,"It is sad that the quality of this volume 3 is so poor. I own many of the other volumes and they are acceptable to good in quality, quality of the pictures themselves. Volume 3 is poor."
3,Not the best Power Ranger toy,I wouldn't recommend this particular Power Ranger toy for a few reasons. First it comes with many small pieces that are easily lost. Second these pieces don't always attach to the ranger as they are supposed to. I would recommend buying the basic action figure such as the ones with the light up shields instead. I also would recommend the Dragon Morphin series if your child wants to have something to transform. Those are of a much better quality.
4,Unusual review of mgt theories,"Lee mostly pokes holes into a lot of management theories, so there is a lot more garbage than gold listed here. it is a really powerful look at why many management theories just don't hold up in real life.Lee was a rather dynamic professor and head of the MBA program at Ohio University"
3,To read or not to read,"I have read many book in my short life, but Windswept passion is one of the book one can not put down. It shows the conflict and emotion of not only the woman as do most books but also of the guy. This book has suspense, betrayal, anger, sadness, and many other emotions. It keeps you on your toes until the end. I shed a few tears while reading this book. I especailly like when they first meet. She's in the tub half asleep while he walks in and sees her there. I think the first eye contact is very unique, no matter how short it is. I recommend every one to read it!"
2,Did not show much of Hearst Castle,"The film talks mostly about Hearst than Hearst Castle. It is a very short film (only 38 minutes) and less than 8 minutes were used to show the Castle. If you expect to tour the castle, you will be greatly disapponted."
2,Great... if you don't want to many facts.,Great... if you don't want to many facts.Lots of soaring photos and pretty sunsets but not lots of facts or historical info.To bad as I was looking for some substance.
4,Good but too short,"It should of been longer, but it is a nicely made film. It does not cover much of the inside of Hearst Castle."
4,See the movie....go see the Castle,"Saw this movie at the IMAX/IWERKS National Geographic Theater at the Hearst Castle visitor's center. Take the time to view this movie first, either by buying this or seeing it at San Simeon and then tour the castle. To really understand why W.R. Hearst/Julia Morgan built this ""ranch house"" you must go back in history and hear the story of his mother, Phoebe Hearst. While no movie is ever going to give you the full impact of seeing the house in person....this will remind you of it!P.S. I highly recommend the evening tours! Got to see the Castle at nighttime!"
4,Good documentary on WRH and Hearst Castle,This DVD provides a good overview of Hearst Castle. The video is shown at Hearst Castle in their theater. It gives a good background on the development of Hearst Castle.
4,HP tx1110us,"Had this laptop for about three weeks. I opted to not get the touchscreen because I would not use it. So far i am liking the laptop, light weight, bright glossy screen, 2.5 hr battery life, great speakers and its attractive to look at and comes with a tiny remote control to play DVDs from far away. My only complaint is the lack of XP drivers available, looks like I am stuck with Vista."
3,"good laptop, achieved my expectatives","if you are looking for an enterteinment laptop, this one will suit you very good. but you can't ask to much furder than that. the laptop is fast, good video, enough capacity, a pretty nice 180^ rotative screen, and the other especifications that they show you. the finger print security system could be upgrated, its far more secure than just a tiped password, but or also quite more slow. and definitly the touch-screen version makes the enterteinment more accessible. you could also improve the remote control, it doesnt work for too much programs, only the volume butons.....i would also like to say that or you forgot to install a certificated microsoft office, or you always send it with a temporal one. if so, you didnt especify that when you are selling the product, and now i have to purchase the package because the product asks me for a serial number everytime i start it. if you have a solution for me, please tell me"
1,"Mr,","Don't buy it, if doesn't have a 2,3 mhz processor or an Intel dual core, don't bother... Also needs a better graphics card, the nvidia geforce 6150 Go can't work with windows vista, also the hardrive must have a 7200 RPM to work properly. Don't buy it."
1,This is not a tablet PC,I ordered mine from Amazon directly. It did not have touch screen capability. See the post in the discussion section for more details.
1,how can an artist loose his soul?,"I EXPECTED THIS TO BE A RE-RELEASE OF LIMAHLS' PAST RECORDINGS; I'VE NEVER BEEN SO LET DOWN! REMEMBER KAJAGOOGOO?, REMEMBER WHEN LIMAHL LEFT THE GROUP FOR HIS SOLO ENDEAVORS LEAVING BEHIND ""KAJA"". ON THEIR OWN...THE BAND OR LIMAHL DIDN'T SOUND TOO BAD....UNTILL THIS RELEASE! SOME WOULD CALL THIS NEW LIMAHL SOUND,MATURE OR POLISHED;I CALL IT WAY OVER-PRODUCED,TO THE POINT THAT POOR LIMAHL SOUNDS LIKE A LOUNGE SINGER! BUY SOME WORKS HERE AT AMAZON.COM BY KAJAGOOGOO OR AFTER THE BREAK-UP ""KAJA""...BUT NOT THIS RELEASE! THIS RELEASE REPRESENTS ALL THAT IS WRONG WITH THE CURRENT MUSIC INDUSTRY....THE SELLING OF ONES SOUL TO MAKE A QUICK BUCK$! LIMAHL....R.I.P"
3,Ok but not premium,"As with other Mashalltown trowels I bought, they tend to rust easily- must be a low alloy stainless. Also the overall detail quality is not as good as premium big box store trowels. I would spend the extra money again"
5,The Fred Book Series,I loved all of the Fred books. I started with the first one and just had to continue the journey. They are so worthwhile. Great discussion starters.
2,Don't waste your money,"This book is thinner than a magazine and geared toward married couples who will be apart for a period of time. I don't see this book geared toward a true long distance relationship where a couple is not married. Some ideas are good, but overall, this book is pretty stupid and a waste of money."
1,not what i expected,"Granted this product wasn't too expensive, but it's definitely something you shouldn't pay for. I found it to be a bit out of date, and also just really a list of things to do, not a book type as I expected. More like a pamphlet full of things I could find on the internet for free. Nice thought, but save your money and just do some online searching."
2,hern,"kinda lame. it is priduced to make more of a coloring book style- as in its super thin and not really like a book. it jsut lists activities. very dissapointed. but still has ideas if that is all you are looking for, just not made for a good read"
2,Very common sense and not helpful,"This pamphlet has mostly completely silly, or completely obvious activities. There are very few options that I found to be helpful, and a lot are outdated."
1,extremely disappointing cd,"I had been doing some basic study of feng shui and found this CD. Much to my disappointment, it did not provide any interactive sections. All the cd provides is a person reading to you the wording that is displayed on your computer. It only tells very basic information (word for word) that can be found on the website that the cd refers to. I considered the purchase a complete waste of money."
1,Not Compatible With Inner Harmony :-),"I have a PC, so don't have the excuse that the platform is incompatible. However, the installation is flawed, and there are no written directions or other information. Thus, the multimedia aspects don't work. What little I can see of the program is not very useful. Wish I hadn't wasted a gift certificate on this."
1,not friendly,although i am intereseted in purchsing this. this is not a mac freindly disk. so it is useless to me. too bad
1,NO STARS!!,"I have not received this item, despite repeated efforts to contact the seller, with no response. I am very very disappointed. The item was a gift to my husband. I ordered it on Dec3-07 and today is Jan11-08...they have the money but I have no item."
4,distubing yet focused,"Incredibly well-filmed, well-acted, near-perfectly-pitched film. Aside from a regrettable ""homage"" to THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE (in which a wonderfully-controlled performance takes a disppointing, cliche'ed turn)and a poorly-executed death scene near the end, this had me mesmerised and often on the edge of my seat. Great atmosphere of tension and unanswered questions. The implausible ""landscape"" is effective and fits the story. The vague morality is SO well done and serves the film perfectly. If only the director could've restrained his ""these films influenced me"" excesses, I'd have given this 5 stars. Not for everyone, by all means, but, if you like an intelligently disturbing film that leaves JUST ENOUGH answered questions, this is one to take a chance on."
2,Weird doesn't equal Scary!,"Not frightening, just weird. The insanity level of every character, except for the victim, in this film creates a world that is unbelievable. And with zero believability there is zero horror, which is why I don't get scared watching ""Godzilla"".***WARNING: Spoilers follow***The initial set up is pretty good. But it all goes down hill (from a horror movie standpoint) when the entire town is revealed to be raving lunatics during the bar scene. The movie became about being weird for the sake of being weird and lost any footing in reality. Yes, I know, men can do crazy and horrific things as a group. The Nazis come to mind. But this film did not succeed in selling the reality of a group gone mad. That several men would all psychotically believe a bloodied man, in a dress, to be their same lost female lover is ridiculous. The dance sequence IS hilarious though. I'm going to learn that step!"
3,Le Calvaire . . . an ordeal indeed,"And an ordeal it certainly is . Calvaire is not just about the horror of all that can go wrong on a person's worst day - and when nowhere near civilization, it is about the staggering desolation and spiritual destitution of being broken by a psychopath with no hope of getting help from the outside world and at the same time being physically disabled by your tormentor . The scene with Marc, Boris and Bartel at the Kitchen table - shot with a 360 degree panorama that induces vertigo - is a psychoscopic peak into the madness that surrounds Marc and is close to ensconcing him completely, if only he can escape . Calvaire, not for the weak or easily intimidated but like all good horror movies from France & Belgium is definetly worth seeing ."
2,Eeeewww! But not in a good way.,"This movie is disturbing and unpleasant. Give it that. Okay maybe the word 'disturbing' evokes an undeniable visceral response. This might not have gotten to you, but there's no denying that it is unpleasant. Nasty.I did not like the movie. At all. Except for the guys dancing in the bar, that scene (starting with the piano) was good enough for a Miike movie.And this doesn't compare to Haute Tension.1. They have nothing in common except violence.2. Haute Tension actually had some action/movement.3. A girl masturbating is not an equivalent cinematic experience as pig raping.4. Haute Tension was superb (aside from some stringent issues I have with the way that the last scene was shot).If you want a dirty movie in pretty woods that is about gender-confused inbreds and don't mind ZERO antagonistic action from the victim, then this is the movie for you.And it is in French!"
2,"This ""Ordeal"" was....","I gotta admit, I'm completely flummoxed by some of the great reviews for this film. Derivative and unintentionally funny--just watch the bar scene in which the local men dance like drunken, sex-starved penguins and you'll know what I mean--this movie was a chore to sit through. Similar to another reviewer, I couldn't believe how pathetic the ""hero"" becomes when he is captured. And what's with all the men thinking this guy's a woman? He might not be macho, but he sure doesn't look like a ""Gloria"" to me. Nice atmospheric touches, a squealing pig, and a cute calf couldn't save this ""homage"" to '70s horror films for me. The Goodwill store can expect my donated copy soon."
1,Excruciating... ly dull,"If Martyrs is an M-80 that goes off in your hand, Calvaire is a sparkler that won't even light. Nothing - NOTHING - happens for the first 50 minutes (and it's a bad sign when you're checking your DVD timer in a horror movie) and what finally does take place is about as arresting as an episode of MASH. This is as non-scary as the worst '80s slasher movies. There are a couple of moments that are so hilariously BAD - the cretin Snoopy dance, the old cretin falling and sinking in quicksnow - that... nah, don't waste your time. Total crap."
1,Defective from the start,I purchased this part in an attempt to repair my jeep. Turns out this part is missing alignment holes required to adjust timing after installtion. I did not know this until after I had my vehicle towed and the mechanic informed that my jeep would require a 2nd synchronizer. Luckly Amazon is great and refunded my $.
2,Not as expected....,"Setting up the bar was easy anf fast.We had it up in 15 mins.However the design of the bar is flawed in the sense that the bar can topple easily since it does not have any base.Also considerign we have carpet floors ,it is very wobbly.If only it had a base this would have taken care of the problem."
5,Great lens,I had one of these lenses before but it had gotten a loose screen in it probably from my trembling hands. I searched for this lens locally but the stores wanted close to $1000 for it. I love amazon prices!
3,"EXCEPT for one major problem, an excellent reference","This book is really a step forward, as far as a comprehensive reference book for working court reporters' use in the 'real' world. Very detailed on most English usage conventions -- and conundrums -- that court reporters need to deal with regularly. HOWEVER, there is one flaw that makes this a difficult book to use quickly -- the index. It should be much more inclusive than what it is. When comparing it to Gregg's index, it falls short. I will hope to see this volume in a revised edition with a new and improved index, which, after all, is the portal into effective use of any reference book."
1,Mattress cover,What a rip off- after paying for shipping I ended up forking out $30 for a mattress and box spring cover. The bags won't even protect your mattress from mildew because all you can do is seal it with tape. Don't waste the money.
4,"An Important, Engaging Study","Bill Mullen's Popular Fronts takes its place alongside William Maxwell's New Negro, Old Left and James Smethurst's The New Red Negro as a vitally important historical and cultural re-evaluation of the relationship between African American literature and the Communist party in the 1930s and 1940s. Deftly synthesizing from a broad range of materials--literary, cultural, historical, anthropological--Mullen chooses a digestibly specific focus on Chicago's cultural renaissance, a period he convincingly establishes as crucially significant to an understanding of African American literature in the twentieth century. My only quibble with the book--and it's a minor one--is that at times it assumes a more complete knowledge of the political landscape of the time than an average reader might have. Some more background on the history of the CPUSA and the Popular Front in general might have helped. Still, a fine study, one that I highly recommend."
5,Life is Goodbye Life is Hello,"My husband of 46 years committed suicide 3 months ago. While reaching out to every resource available to me, I came across this book. After reading it, I went back through and highlighted it everywhere it hit the mark. It took two days. This is the most astoundingly helpful book I've seen and I've read a lot of them. I've also recommended it to my therapists as a wonderful source of wisdom, insight, and understanding for those who are dealing with all kinds of grief: death, divorce, job loss, giving birth and many other events. What a lot of helpful insights Dr. Bozarth offers! I recommend it unreservedly to all who are traveling down this road. God be with you. Elizabeth J. Riney, M.D."
5,Best book ever on grieving over anything!,"This book has helped me so much during a very rough time in my life where I've split from my husband, lost my house that I dearly loved, and moved to a place that I hate. It helps you understand what you're going through, and it gives you things to do that can help. An amazingly good book!"
5,a wonderful gift,"I bought this blender for a friend for his birthday. He raves about the performance and basically loves it. I was worried it would be too cumbersome in size, but it's really not. The cleanup is great, you fill it halfway with warm water and a drop of soap and blend it."
5,KA Pro Blender,"Noisy, buy does a great job. Also, very easy to clean and looks great on my counter. Each time I use this, I am so glad that I bought it."
4,blender,"I have other Kitchen Aide appliances, so when I was ready to leave the $40 blender I went for this machine. Of course, it makes noise, but more important It make purrees. So far I'm satisfied."
1,Was amazing at first but one year later...,"This thing got me through my jaw surgery - 2 months of blended food only! When I first got it, I was so impressed by the ice-crushing power. It made light work of turning frozen strawberries into smoothies in seconds. But here I am just over a year later and the thing doesn't work. Can't even blend a banana in a cup of milk. At the time of purchase, I spent nearly $300 and opted to not get a used Vita-Mix because it wouldn't fit under my kitchen cupboard and didn't look nice on the countertop. This blender was pretty and great for about 8 months but at this point it's disposable. I will take the advice of another comment though and try and see if I can get a replacement."
3,Don't drink the koolaide,"I own a pro line... it died after a year of use. Yep... it has enough power to cut the grass... and sounds like a jackhkammer on the countertop... but what good is all that power if it is spinning the blades in an air pocket. I make smoothies with Ice, bananna, fruits. I always have to either shake the unit or use a wooden spoon to move the stuff around. I paid $300. Did I mention mine burned out after 14 months of service? I have another blender that was about $79 and did a better job on smoothies. It will probably die in a year... but I'd rather pay $79 per year than 200."
4,Why the price increase???,"What's with Amazon?? A few days ago Amazon had this item listed at 185.00 dollars. Many other seller had the item for 199.00, (and still do). I placed the item in my cart and continued to shop. When I went back to place the order the price had been increased to 222.00. Everyone else has it for 199.00 -----so shop before you buy. So much for Amazon's integrity"
1,KitchenAid KPCB348PNP,"Totally disappointed with KitchenAid's quality assurance - My blender came DOA, it will not switch on. I bought this blender for my wife's birthday, it did not work for the first time she tried to use it. I went through the entire operation and troubleshooting sections of the owner's manual without success. It just will not switch on. So much for the best KitchenAid blender."
5,Xstampers are forever!,"I've been using Xstamper products for several years, now. They're vastly more durable than regular stamping products. Of the variety of Xstampers I've purchased, none have worn out or needed re-inking, yet. What a terrific value, especially here on the Amazon. com site. I was very happy to eliminate the need for messy stamp pads and make it so much easier to perfect impression every time.A clear, sharp impression; a variety of sizes and styles; ergonomic body and soft grip handle; these are some of the reasons Xstamper products are used by government purchasing departments, including the post office and state & federal government agencies who demand high quality products.AND... the company offers a lifetime guarantee. Here are some of the other title stamps listed here on Amazon.com:Two-color COPYTwo-color ORIGINALTwo-color PAIDTwo-color ENTEREDTwo-color VOIDTwo-color FOR DEPOSIT ONLYTwo-color FLAG StampSpecialty DO NOT BENDSpecialty FRAGILESpecialty Jumbo PAID"
2,mike shinoda is not a good rapper,"the production is good, and I can see how this would be cool if I were a Linkin Park from, but coming at this from a hip-hop avenue, this album is wack. Mike Shinoda's rhymes are at best medicore, and his flow is weak."
3,Good,"The book itself was delivered quickly and in perfect condition. The read of the book is slow though, very long and slightly boring. Has a vast amount of information, but some of it needs to be expalined more, and some of the information drags on for too long."
3,Very Good Early American History,"Alan Taylor's The Divided Ground is a very detailed and interesting account of the northern borderland druing the time period of the end of the French and Indian War to the early part of the 19th century. Taylor's book presents how native american lands were extracted from them over the years. Culprits were the american and british governments, new york state, land speculators, and even some native americans helped. The reader will learn more about such historical fiqures as Joseph Brant, George Clinton, Roger Morris, Guy Carleton, and others who are not always on our historical periscope. Some general history readers may find this book too long or gets too bogged down in details. However, if the reader has an interest in early american history, native american history and revolutionary war history, this is a worthwhile read."
3,Works BUT,"Lever for trip valve is too short, thus the flapper doesn't center over the opening and causes slight leakage. Not real happy with this product."
5,Excellent Production,I had never seen this play before. It was excellent and great cast.It didn't seem so Shakesperian in the language as some plays. Easy to understand.
3,works good,Works good for somebody who may need it for their own diagnosis. Would prefer a bigger light that shines on more area.
4,BEST!,"reminds me of the old days, the video quality is 3/5 and i would recommend this movie to anyone who likes old kungfu movies"
4,It is just so romantic,"Oh man, it is just so sweet! All those loves songs, man I just love it! I hope you all can enjoy it too! It has really great songs on it! You have to buy it! TRUST ME!"
4,Better than it sounded,"this book was much better than it sounded when i first read the back cover. i wasn't sure i'd like it, but when a friend gaave it to me to read, i found myself enjoying the story. i was anxious to find out what happened next. i highly recommend this book."
5,So much fun....you can't wait to see what happens next!!!,"This is one of those books that enables you to get to know a truly fun group of people. They're brilliant, talented and each has their own distinct personality. The author does a great job of keeping the plot interesting and full of surprises."
3,I wish I was this talented!,"I found this title far more than the everage arts and crafts book--it's colorful, meaty, literate (how many craft books quote Edith Wharton?)and best of all inspiring. The author admits her purchase of a huge Victorian mansion (now a B&B) plunged her into many decorating projects and she often felt, ""I'm not in charge anymore, the house wants this..."" From bandboxes to quilts, a teddy bear or a tea cosy, this is more than a craft book--it's a good read!"
3,Parallel Perils in Penzance,"An unlikely plot, and dialogue that crosses over into trite way too often, still an interesting travelogue and glimpse into the coastal town of Penzance. Dorothy Martin is a retired American schoolteacher and recent newlywed to retired Chief Constable Alan Nesbitt. Escaping the constant rain in their cathedral town, this unlikely pair of sleuths head for the sunshine at the seaside, and another peek at a decades old crime. The likelihood of a repeat of that crime is a stretch, and Dorothy crosses the line between caring and interested into nosy and bossy one time too many for this reader. The story has moments of charm and a sense of place, but could have benefited from a map (most books could?). Not a strong recommendation, but still an interesting escape."
3,Not like the others,"This was not a bad mystery at all, but it lacked the coziness of her other books. Instead, it brought in a lot of the sordidness of society that exists today that I really prefer not to have in my books. I read for enjoyment and entertainment; if I went something more true to life, I'll find it in the newspapers. The author brought in a lot of the sadness people feel in the excessive use of drugs and alcohol by those in the younger age group, and the knowledge that nothing can be done about it. I hope that in her following books the author returns to her more familiar cozies that don't leave you feeling so despondent."
3,not so good,"it arrived a week later and works as expected. time will tell if it holds up and continues to work. I don't use color printing that often. i could recommend the merchant but don't know right now how long the cartridge will work. HERE'S AN UPDATE: THE COLOR CARTRIDGE LASTED ONLY TWO MONTHS, ABOUT A DOZEN COLOR TEXT DOCUMENTS. Not recommended."
5,Cheap and Useful,I can use my printer without having to think it cost me too muchmoney and I love it Thanks
4,This product is recommended for maintenance of the ...,"This product is recommended for maintenance of the urinary tract. I think that the capsules are an easy and convenient way to get the advantages of cranberries without having to drink a lot of the juice, which is often very high in sugar. I'd recommend it based on my use thus far."
3,I'm not sure if I would recommend this ...,"I'm not sure if I would recommend this to anyone or not. I like the idea of preventing urinary tract infections with this product, but it's difficult to take and has some side effects. The dosage is one to four capsules at each meal -- that would be up to twelve a day, and the bottle had only 50 in it. I started out on a very low dosage, because I wasn't sure what it would do to me -- there was nothing at all on the package other than the dosage directions. This is a very powerful diuretic. From the first dosage, I found myself in the bathroom a lot. It also tended to give me diarrhea when I took a full day's dose. It seems easier to me to just drink a lot of cranberry juice if you're worried about urinary infections."
3,I took the recommended dose of the product ...,"I took the recommended dose of the product for one week. I noticed absolutely no effects, either adverse or positive. I didn't get a urinary infection during this period but I didn't get one the week before without it."
5,"Only one problem, your kid won't want to stop playing it!",My 7 year old loves this game. I think we play this at least 10+ times a day. It's very fun and simple to play.
4,Fun - but buy 2!,Many of the reviews suggest buying 2 of these and I agree. It's easy to run out of pieces; and it's more fun with more pieces - the longer you can play.Very easy to play. Fun. Good family game.
4,Cute little snakes,"My granddaughter (5) instantly had to play with this game. She was alone and made up her own version. Of course pieces were everywhere, but she was entertained completely. Great game!"
5,Snakes on a plane!,"Coming to a plane (floor or table top) near you is likely the most fun and simple game you could ever play with your young children. I bought this based on the customer reviews and have had many hours of fun playing this game with my two young sons.The game graphics are colorful and cute, and the game play reinforces matching, logic, and counting skills. Set up and clean up are just a few seconds each.My only critique is that there should be more heads and tail cards, but like one reviewer wrote, one can always buy a second set. I'll likely be doing that soon, because I think we'll be playing this for a while."
5,Great Children's Game + for all ages!,"We and any ""children"" who join us with this game love it! We had to purchase it for our nephews."
5,Wonderful card game for young children,"This game is a wonderful card game for young children. I have purchased it for grandkids from 3 years old, and even a 6 year old likes to play it. The colors are wonderful, it is easy to play (no complicated rules or words for young ones to read) but there is an element of ""winning"" involved. I.E., who can make the most ""snakes."" The cards are of a heavier weight, therefore are very durable. I highly recommend this game for 3 and up children."
5,Fun game.,"My son LOVES snakes, and games. So this was a no brainer choice. We all sit around and try and create snakes. it's simple and fun and gets the whole family involved in snake making!"
5,Best Game For the Kids By Far,"Hisss is the perfect game for the 3-5 year old range. My girls absolutely love it. It is simple enough for a 3 year old to play, but still exciting enough to hold my 5 year old's attention. No crazy rules, fumbling with cards in their hands, spinners, etc. Hisss is just a simple game of color/pattern matching with easy rules and surprisingly addictive game play.My 2 girls have probably logged 50 hours or more of play time between them and still ask for it all the time. It is one activity they can do together without fighting. Plus, it reinforces matching skills. It is the perfect game for that rainy day when you're struggling to keep the kids busy."
2,Why does everybody like this so much?,"Maybe my little guy is just too old for this (he's 4), but this game bores both of us. There are way too many middle pieces, and not enough heads and tails, so you end-up making very long snakes, but not very many snakes (total of 7 head/tail pairs IF you end-up putting the middles together in the perfect combinations to allow all 7 to get made). It's not very exciting, it's ok in the matching department, but I would say the target age range would be 3 years old. Overall, we were disappointed."
3,Bored with Hisss,"This is a nice game especially for beginners. My son is four and has autism. He is also delayed. He can play this game easily (except for scoring) and enjoyed it at first, but became bored with it rather quickly. The picture represents the product well. Pick a card and see if you can match it to the snake you are creating. Im surprised by the high reviews. I would have thought more people would have tired of it quickly. I gave it three stars because it is a good game, but for us the fun didn't last."
1,Could be right for your family,"We're a ""game"" family. At age three, my wife and I played the following games with our son: Candyland, Don't Spill the Beans, Battleship, Sorry, Connect Four, Checkers, Chutes and Ladders, and Trouble. By age four we'd addedNo Stress ChessandTic Tac Checinto the mix.I think this would have been a good purchase around the time he was learning Candy Land. But at age four the game became boring quickly. I would make that your guideline: if your child likes Candyland, your child will like Hiss. If your child is moving on to more complicated games, your child may be too old for Hiss.As a side note, Hiss may be a good game to play when friends come over. I imagine 3-year-olds and up could play this game completely unsupervised."
5,Great for 2 to 75,"I bought this for Christmas for my 3 grandkids (2,4,6) based on reviews I saw here. Everyone from the 2 year old to the parents and grandparents had a great time playing it. It will be enjoyed for years to come. I'm going to do as others have suggested and buy another set or two so more of us can play at the same time!"
5,Perfect for family game time with younger children!,"This game kept a 7 year old, 6 year old, and 3 year old entertained for more than an hour ... enough said.The quality was much better than expected considering the relatively cheap price. I will be shopping for more Gamewright games for Christmas."
5,Great Game for whole family!! Great as a gift too!,My mom bought this for my 4 year old daughter not even a week ago. She has insisted we play it at least 3 times a day! She LOVES it and it's a game my husband and I enjoy too! It's perfect for age 3-5 year olds who are learning to match and count. She gets so excited when she draws the rainbow head or tail!! Great game!
2,not exciting enough for boys,My 4 (almost 5) year old grandson was bored by this game pretty quickly. I'm looking for something with more action.
5,Great game for my 4 year old!,"My mother, who is a preschool teacher, purchased ""Hiss"" for my 4 year old son this year. He is just like most 4 year olds...very little attention span. This game is fast moving which is great for the most impatient child. Helps child identify, match colors and often gives them the option to make their own choices on placement. It's the perfect game for my 4 year old son and I to play together. I've bought extra copies for his little buddies birthdays. Love this!"
5,MaGnA Lover!!!,"If you are a girl and you are looking for a good comic kinda book to read this is your chance!! this story about an orapah teenage who meet three guys with a deep dark family seacert!! this book has a bit of romanice, a pinch of drama, a spoon of fantsy, and lot of funny parts!! don't past your chance up. i GARENTEE you will like this book!!"
4,Is Fruit's Basket worth a shonen lovers time?,"Forget all the screaming girls raves,you are a shonen lover,should you try out this shojo manga?The answer would be no.While I still buy it merely for my love of two of the characters (Shigure and Ayame), I wouldn't reccomend it for any who have a strong thirst for blood and violence. The fight scenes (if you can even call them that) are short, dull, and usually one sided.As for drama, the story goes from a petty cold or fever being serious business, to, I love you... but so does he. Comedy, now there is plenty. Especially from Ayame and Shigure. But, stick with shojo, don't cross over for this just because it's popular.Go read Samurai Deeper Kyo if you haven't already."
4,My thoughts,I thought this manga was pretty good. I would recommend this manga to the advanced manga reader. It has the suspense and comic relief needed to make one laugh.
4,Fruits Basket 1 Summary,"This is one of the best manga books ever! You meet cool characters: Tohru Honda the main character who lives in a tent but then meets some of the Sohma characters like Shigure,and Yuki. Tohru starts living with the Sohma's and finda out their ""secret"". You'll meet other Sohma's like Kyo and Kaugra. You'll have to read it to find out!"
4,Fruits Basket Vol. 1,"Sweet but strange. Surprisingly funny, full of engaging characters of all stripes, this is a great start to a great manga series that manages to make the transition to English with grace and humor intact. The first volume introduces the most central characters (of a cast where no character is truly minor), the circumstances that propel the majority of the series, and plant the seeds for further plot explication and development. Just lovely."
5,Better than GREAT,"This book was confusing at first, but once i got of hang of reading japanese books, I was hooked. I read it 6 times and it still wasn't boring. My sister and fight over it all the time. It is a hilarious combo with a litte spice of sadness, but not to much sadness.Just my kind of book. If you love these kind of, it is worth buying. I can't wait to get the second book, third, fourth, fifth, and the whole series. I can't wait!!!!!!!!!!"
5,my favorite manga,"i was looking for some new manga, so i decided to just look at this one to see what it was about. now i have become addicted to the furuba manga and anime. it is so cute and you will absolutely fall in love with the characters. probably one of the best mangas out there in my opinion."
3,Guilty pleasure for the terminally sentimental,"Fruits Basket: An obvious plot, a ditsy heroine, and cute animals. I know I should hate this manga, but I don't. Nothing cheers a bad mood like Fruits Basket. Takaya seems very genuine and her love of her characters is apparent in her art.The anime is fun, better produced then most, but misses most of the major drama of the manga.If you are following it in Japanese (I am) you will soon find out that the ""shocking"" drama does not seem to end, it goes on and on. Recently, after a year of almost painful redundancy the story started moving again and becomes interesting.Those unfortunate people that like drawn out sentimentality will be surprised how engrossing this manga can be. If not, this manga will lose interest somewhere between book 10 and book 15 (not yet released in US.)"
2,boring and bland,"this book was not only boring but bland i thought it would be better thank god i got it pretty cheap. i like manga and anime like rosario vampire,black cat,bleach,cowboy bepop,inyusha. but this didnt deliver no real action it all looked the same and was very confusing at many times i didnt know who was who. the story was good but the anime for the manga remind me of saliormoon which is good but i didnt like it and being as i am a girl i thought id like this but there isnt enought action. i dont even like the main character she is bland also the only charactor i liked was the cat. another thing was there names to hard for me to say im not good with names let alone japenese naames. over all only get this if u like romance."
2,Peh...,"I read this manga a couple months ago...It's a fluffy manga directed towards young girls, which is extremely ironic considering I'm both of those...Again, the main character is an orphan *yawn* I've yet to see a manga where the main character had both parents...I really tried to get into this manga despite the fact I see fangirls squelling over it. I bought the second and third manga and maybe it could just be because I tend to like mangas with a little more action and the fact that I'm not much of a romantic...But I just. Didn't. Like it.If your anything like me, I'd suggest going towards mangas with a tad bit more fight...Mainly, Fullmetal Alchemist, Bleach, YuYu Hakusho, or Naruto.Happy Otakuing!"
1,boring,"I hope you listen to this review. This is the most boring manga ever. The main character is pathetic. She is such a wimp. The art is pretty bad. This isn't a comedy. You won't laugh at all. The action scenes are terrible. One of the genres is romance. The romance is badly written. If you want manga with beautiful art, try The Tarot Cafe. If you want comedy, try Popo Can. If you want action, try Fullmetal Alchemist. If you want romance, try Dramacon. Please, do not buy this garbage."
1,It is not worth the craze.,"it was a bunch of stupid sentimental bull.X( It was so popular thought id give it a try, but it totally sucked. Its all poor me im an orphan living on my own, cry me a river. Do not spend money on this piece of junk."
3,good book for beginners,I had hoped for a little more information. This book would be great for someone who needs to follow a project plan.
5,excellent!,Just the job and well worth the asking price. Excellent! I shall dip into this volume for years to come.
5,excellent book,This a great book and very helpful in learning about the History of the Scottish people and their customs and country.
3,Good Reference Material,"Obviously a lot of time and effort was put into the research, which is very good.Although I understand that this is primarily a reference text, some short stories on the acts that led to the individual awards would make very interesting reading."
5,Huge amounts of Research went into this book,"An index-format medal book, the amount of research that went onto this book is staggering.It is one of the best medal books ever written about a really obscure but fascinating subject area; I HIGHLY recommend this book.I thought it was worth every penny and it is destined to be a sought after collectors' item."
3,Very Good Research,"Generally a well researched tome on a relatively narrow subject which should interest military historians and especially those (and their families)that were awarded Poland's highest decoration for bravery.The only negative and disappointment I can find is the author's arrogant self-serving, self-review of his work which he himself characterizes as a ""..masterpiece..' Give me a break!"
1,"It tastes awful, and it dosen't work.",This is the worst medicine i have ever tasted. It dosen't even work. I took it once (i had a huge cough) and i vomited! DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICINE! YOU WILL REGRET IT!
3,CD was good,"Even though this CD was no way as good as ""Incredible"" overall it was ok. My favorite songs wereBeliver,Heaven,What is this, very anointed young women, I enjoyed the songs very much... Hope this review helps.."
3,Great Vocals,"I love the song ""Heaven"" of course and ""Yesterday. I needed to hear this song because I sort of went through something on yesterday and I was crying and this song simply touched my spirit. The lyrics for ""Yesterday"" simply applied to me."
3,I like this CD...,"There are good songs on this CD, but I listen to this album less than the other Mary Mary albums."
3,"Maybe More for ""Music"" Lovers than ""Gospel Music"" Lovers","I purchased this CD with great hope. I have to admit, Mary Mary has never been my favorite group. But I have really enjoyed some of their work from the past. This solidifies my position as a fair-weathered fan of Mary Mary's. This CD is definitely more about the Music than the Gospel. Although, the music is wonderful--especially the cut with the Big Band Jazz feel (The Biggest/Greatest Thing. . .). I love jazz, and that was probably my favorite cut for that reason. Maybe they should be reclassified as Jazz or Pop artist, not Gospel artist. That seems to be their ultimate goal."
1,mary mary,"I DIDN'T LIKE THE CD-EVERY SONG ON THE ALBUM WAS NOT FOR ME,AND THEIR VOICES ARE HORRIBLE.I GIVE THE SELLER FIVE STARS FOR THE SHIPPING QUALITY-THE CD WAS IN PERFECT CONDITION.THANK YOU"
5,no thank,The first cd that i play sound great so i hope this one sound just as good looking forward to listen to it
5,Classic Contemporary Gospel Album,"This album can already sit as a classic album in my book and it's only a little over 4 years old. From beginning to end every song on here is full of rich, spiritual lyrics, but at the same time has a trail-blazing contemporary sound. There's even a few traditional cuts like ""Yesterday"" and ""Speak to Me"". If you haven't heard this album all the way through, your Christian music set is lacking. If I had to pick a favorite from here it would probably have to be either ""Heaven"" or ""Save Me"". But everything is good on this. Stop reading reviews and just cop it!"
4,A very good CD,"I heard one of the songs at church. We had a Women's Conference at our church and the dance team performed to it. I got the CD and there are several other great songs that I've enjoyed listening to. My favorite is ""Save Me Now""."
3,OK,"Comparing Thankful and Mary Mary, my favorite is Thankful!! Couldn't listen to Incredible yet. Its not available here. Nevertheless, still listening to this one and am not fed up with it. ;))Love you girls!! Keep it up!"
4,Great CD...So in love with Mary Mary,"First let me say that Mary Mary has once again captured my heart. Being a musician myself, they have inspired me to continue doing what I do and for that, I love Mary Mary. However, as mentioned before, its very inconvenient for me to only be able to listen to this CD on my computer (iPod carrier here too). The files are protected and can't be converted into AAC format therefore they cannot be played on the iPod. Great content, but very inconvenient for iPod carriers..."
5,Awesome Representation Sisters!,"This is an awesome body of work ladies, you continue to make me very, very proud. The one thing I have to comment on that isn't relative to you as ministers or artists and that is, I can't download this to my iPod or desktop which limits my listening to the car."
5,Didn't Know them until 95.7 R & B,"If your not from Hampton Roads then you probably won't know the radio station I'm referring to. But anyway, this station was either headed up by or created or endorsed by the great Luther Vandross, probably one of the greatest if not the best R&B star ever. I was listening to this great song called ""Heaven"" and later learned that my other favorite song ""Yesterday"" were on this great album called Mary Mary. Before 95.7 R & B, stars like Mary Mary, Yolanda Adams and Kirk Franklin, Cece Winans and Charles G Hayes' Work It Out, were unknown notorities. You want to hear some great Gospel as well as R& b and pop, check this station out! It jump started my love for these two sisters and my Gospel music revolution! This album is the best! i may check out Incredible next and i do have there first album. All i can Say is wow!"
1,"Trash -- not yummy, just trash","I should have known from the title that this book is Oscar Wilde meets the National Enquirer. Here's the long and short of it: Oscar Wilde had a *LOT* of gay sex. Does McKenna have delicious, juicy stories about it? No. Is there evidence to base this on? Hey, the National Enquirer doesn't need footnotes, so why should McKenna?This isn't history, and it isn't juicy dish. Why bother?"
5,A page turner!,"I admit that I knew very little of Oscar Wilde when I chose this particular book, at random. What an excellent choice for a novice as well as a Wilde devotee! Not only did I appreciate the tragic love story of Oscar, Constance, and Bosie, but I also gained an insight into Victorian mores and political machinations. We apparently can't claim the corner on the market of corrupt zealots.If you haven't read Mr. McKenna's work, you must. In the biography arena, this book is beyond the realm."
4,"Great record, but for fans of the period","There are easier places to break into Hancock's hardcore electric fusion period - and fusion in general - than this record. usually when someone refers to fusion, they're refering to a mix of jazz with some other more popular form of music: funk, rock, etc. This record is part of the Electronic Fusion/Jazz gang, and conversely will likely yield a better time for fans of ambient music or Autechre/Brian Eno/early Kraftwerk than, say, Weather Report.The album is hardcore 70s Herbie, pre-Headhunters, which is where most people come onboard with him outside of his Miles Davis gigs and ""Rock It"". It's not for the faint of heart, and not even the one from this period you should start with. Try ""ManChild"" or ""Mwandishi"" before you hit this one. You'll appreciate its depth more."
5,To Dr. Gleason,"Hi there. I think that what you say is basically true. However, a lot of people actually recognize your innovations as your own and give you credit for introducing sophisticated synth work into jazz-fusion. A s far as Hancock is concerned I never thought of him as an innovator in terms of synths. More as a brilliant jazz pianist who enjoyed playing all sorts of electric keyboards, which is ok too."
1,Sounds like a computer game,"Did nothing for me. Rather boring sound loops.I am very surprised at the high number of 5 and 4 stars. With a collection of some 50 albums, this is not one of Herbie's best albums.The music seems rather dated"
5,Excellent Vitamin Pak,"Been taking 1 pak daily for about 6 weeks now and I must say that this is an excellent product. I do not get the bright yellow urine effect as some reviewers got but I drink quite a lot of water. My routine is first thing when I get up, take a pak (on an empty stomach, not recommended though)with water and have a cup of coffee and within 30 to 45 mins start to workout. So far I've seen some muscle gain and experienced increased stamina with the aerobic exercises (boxing, sprinting). I do recommend this product, 5 stars."
3,You can't sell a book that's only 10 pages long.,"While it's a great idea, and a definite recommended item to anyone with an interest (personal or career-wise) in business, it has a suspiciously ""stretched out"" feel...Each chapter has a different point to it, as one would expect. However, unless you read the title chapters, its impossible to tell what the exact point of each chapter actually is. Instead, each chapter seems to reiterate the point (that brands are built through the opportunities that divergance brings about, not convergance) by simply providing further examples."
4,"Interesting, but flat","When I first started to read this book I was captivated by the backbone of the book. The main points that Ries are talking about is branding and divergence. Its starts off well, and then digresses into preaching on about the evils of convergence. He allocates too much space to convergence and you find yourself skipping pages as you 'get the point' and want to get on with why you bought the book. Anyone interested in branding should read this, the principles are excellent and clearly written."
2,"Too many examples, too few words of wisdom","This book was a disappointment for the most part. The only real use I could see for it is to give it to someone in your company who is all gung-ho on convergence or is afraid to tackle creating a new product category. There are many, many, many examples in the book, heavily weighted in areas of technology, communication, etc. and after a while you want to scream, HEY I GOT THE POINT ALREADY! If you're looking for useful advice and guidance, try any one of Ries' other books, which rank among the best on differentiation."
4,"Like its namesake, has a few holes","If you can get past some flawed Darwinian thinking, this book makes some excellent points that will change the way your run your business and invest your money. The father/daughter team of Al & Laura Ries are the first to talk about divergence being where the money is, albeit not as glamerous as the press related to convergence products. As a small business owner, I found this book helpful in planning my own strategy even at a regional level. Like Darwin's theories, this book also has some gaping, unexplainable holes in its theories. Al & Laura give many examples to support their work, but conveniently forget about businesses that buck the very trends they discuss. Nothing is as black and white as the Ries' make it. Read the book, take it with the proverbial grain of salt."
5,Essential for pet birds,"If you have pet parrots who require nail clipping, and they all do, you need to have this Kwik Stop on-hand. No matter how careful we are, we periodically nick one of the nails and they bleed pretty freely. No real harm, but this Kwik Stop halts the bleeding and probably reduces stress on the bird as a result. Recommended! RJB."
5,It stops bleeding fast!,"I started clipping my dogs' nails myself to avoid the high costs of grooming ""pawdicures"" and such. A couple of times, groomers themselves made my dogs scream and bleed, so I thought, why not learn and do it myself? I did, and I have rarely had a problem. However, one of my dogs has black nails. It is hard to spot the quick on his nails, so one time, I cut a little past it, and the nail started bleeding. Dog nails bleed so much and fast, very much like a human flesh paper cut. This product did what it is supposed to do and it worked fast. As soon as his nail bled, I applied a little bit of this powder on a moist cotton ball, and it stopped the bleeding. Also, this version of styptic powder has benzocaine, which numbs the affected area, allowing your dog to heal with less pain. I highly recommend it. Anybody should have it at least in the back of your medicine cabinet as a ""just in case"" product. It also works on minor cuts or when cleaning up tails that have been docked."
4,Back-up plan,"Black lab with black nails. difficult to see, difficult to cut. It's always nice to have a back-up plan when things go wrong...."
3,Doesn't Work Much Better Than Flour,"My dog got an abrasion on the top of her head, which is notoriously hard to stop from bleeding due to the excess of nerves and veins. We tried flour, liquid bandage, and even actually bandaging her head (not recommended, as I later found out, since dogs will invariably do all they can to remove the bandaging and will likely disturb the wound in the process). Eventually I bought this because it's the one thing I haven't tried. Turns out it's about as effective as flour, meaning, it's effective when it is reapplied with vigilance and if your dog stays mostly inactive/unexcited. It's just thousands of times more expensive than flour ($6.66 for .5oz versus $2.99 for 5lbs, you do the math). I think this is meant for when a dog endures scratches or if you accidentally cut the bulb during nail cutting. That or if you dog is very calm."
2,not what i expected.,I ordered this because i was going to start clipping my dogs nails myself. I was under the impression that when her nails start to bleed i would put this on and it would cauterize it. but my dogs nail just pushed the blood right past it. so i had to put it on then push on it as to force it in the nail. it would stop then but soon as she started to walk it would start bleeding again.
4,Works fast!,Good product. Be sure to use a dampened cotton swab to apply in clipped nail. Stopped bleeding quickly and painlessly.
5,follow the directions,this product works exactly as it should. I quicked one of my dogs and it stopped the bleeding in under one minute vs about 20 minutes of holding a towel over the nail.
4,Never Worry About Clipping Your Dogs Nails Again,"This Styptic powder is EXCELLENT. My dog's nails are black and it's difficult to gauge where the quick ends. I try to be very careful but generally have at least one ""accident"" every time I clip her nails. This stops the bleeding immediately and has the extra benefit of having Benzocaine to relieve any discomfort. Wouldn't be without this. Also good for minor cuts and abrasions anywhere on the animal."
1,Half Empty Bottle,"The item arrived unsealed (as in the product is not sealed under the cap) with the powder around the outside of the cap and the bottle half empty (though none inside the cardboard box.) It's going back for that alone. Who knows what the powder is since the company doesn't care to seal the container for what is, in essence, a topical medical product. The powder inside could be laundry detergent by appearances and applying it to a wound seems ill advised. I have no idea whose problem this is, Kwik Stop or Amazon (the seller), but all buyers should be aware."
5,Good product,"I haven't had to use this yet, thank goodness. But, it's nice to have around just in case! I always pour some into the lid before clipping my dogs' nails, so it's ready in case of an accident. The lid is kind of rubbery so it's easy to take off and put back on. Comes with plenty of powder!"
2,My Review,"I received this item within a timely manner; but when I recieved it, I took it out of the packaging, and it looked to have already been opened.... There was yellow powder on the outside of the container, like someone had opened it, spilled a little poweder and gotten it messy, and then put the powder back in? None seemed to be missing... But it just looked VERY unprofessional. I would reccomend buying this product from a different seller."
4,Albolene Moisturizing Cleanser,"I was glad to find this product online at Amazon, as I can no longer find it in the stores.I ordered two jars, one for myself and the other for my daughter. This product is great for removing makeup. Much better than a lot of the more expensive brands. It arrived in a timely manner and in great condition."
3,Nearly perfect with mediocre gameplay,"I recently rented Perfect Dark at Blockbuster and I'm quite surprised that it got some bad reviews here. It is not terrible, but it is not excellent either. But, it has some drawbacks because it seems impossible to master the ""extras"" in the game. The sound effects aren't horrendous, they are the parts that are nearly perfect.Another problem is that sometimes when a guard is struck down by bullets you fired, they might consider that you ""mission failed."" That made me think. I said to myself, ""If the guard is dead, how could my mission fail?""This game is mediocre at best, but it is more fun to watch someone else play this game rather than playing it yourself. Trust me, it is a decent rental."
3,Not up to snuff...,"Perfect Dark on the Nintendo 64 was a nearly flawless shooter for the console. This Game Boy version comes out and ends up being a complete waste. Why must Rare create a game that makes it impossible to really sneak around and use stealth tactics when they claim that you must do so in order to survive. Survival of this game is simply having ammo (always low on that) and trying to shoot people that are coming from an angle. The only saving grace of this game is the great use of sound and the features, such as boss attack and such. Make sure you know what you are getting before you pick up this title."
4,Good but very difficult!,This game was good when I first started playing it. the graphics are ok but the heads of Joanna and the enimies are just circles. The sound effects are great though. It can and will get a little gory. The stealth training is really hard because you can't even let a single guard hear you if he does you fail. Overall this is a decent game. One more thing I like about it is the rumble feature it's pretty cool! i reccomend this game to any one who wants a handheld portable James Bond like game.
1,Perfect Disappointment,"I got Perfect Dark for the N64 the day it came out and was actually surprised that it was better than I had expected. When I saw the same title for Gameboy, I figured it would be a portable version of the great N64 game.Boy, was I wrong. This is easily the worst game I own. The controls don't work, the sound isn't good, and the game play is horrible. Almost entirely the opposite of what the N64 game was. In fact, really the only thing in common between the two is the title and main character.In short, if you liked the N64 version, don't bother with this game. If you hated the N64 version, I suppose you might like this."
4,A good solid game boy color game,"When I got this game I thought it would be perfect dark shrunk down. It was hard to get used to at first, the training mode was not very forgiving! When I had mastered the basic controls, I was having a lot of fun. Also when you beat a boss or any other special event, you unlock it in the extras mode, where you can play it again. I really think this is a good game once you get used to the controls and it is one of the best game boy color games. If you liked this game, I suggest Metal Gear Solid(game boy color version). Not only is it a fun game, but it has a smaller chracters, which means you can see a lot of places on the map (YES!!!!) unlike perfect dark, you often get shot in the back from offscreen. I would have to say that metal gear solid is even better than perfect dark because it has around 200 training missions and 13 stroy missions. All in all these two games are must-haves for the gameboy color"
5,the perfect game!,"the best game i own...the game stars joanna dark as the main character as this is why its called perfect dark!!!the graphics are excellent showing full on movie scenes.the game is hard but i have only had it since christmas and have already procressed to level 5 boss, were your kept on a boat unarmed...its hard... the game is great, well with a few minor minuses such as no decent music and cruddy controls..."
3,Pretty good nowhere near a classic like the N64 one though.,This is a decent game but the Nintendo 64 version blows it completely out of the water.I mean I could really use a combat simulator to play when Im stuck in the main game but still there are some great action scenes.The graphics and sound are terrible though.I suggest you skip this one unless youre a die hard Perfect Dark fan.You should get Super Mario Deluxe instead at least that is more fun.
1,"Bypass this one, holmes","There is nothing perfect about this game, so that right there is false advertising. Anyway, how fun can a game be that allows you to get shot from an enemy who is shooting you while rushing in from off screen? Sound fun? Well, no, it's not. Gameboy color games are pretty weak across the board...I'd stick to the Advance. Perfect Dark is just [mindless]."
5,TESLA'S PURE TALENT,"WOW, WHAT TO SAY? THIS ALBUM WAS AND STILL IS ONE OF THE DEFINING POINTS OF THIS PERIOD OF ROCK. TESLA ROCKED THE ARENA'S OF THE WORLD AND THIS ALBUM WAS THEIR BREAK OUT. COMPLETELY FULL OF GREAT SONGS. NO NOT ONE BAD ONE TO BE FOUND HERE! IF YOU HAVENT HEARD THIS ONE YOU SERIOUSLY NEED TO. TESLA CONTINUED TO PUT OUT GOOD ALBUMS BUT THIS IS THEIR BABY !ALSO IF YOUR INTO THIS TYPE OF GOOD TALENTED ROCK N ROLL CHECK OUT THE TORA TORA CDS. ABSOLUTELY WAY UP THERE IN MY OPINION. THESE GUYS WERE BEHIND IN THE GAME BLOOMING LATE AND GOT LOST IN THE GRUNGE BUT LORD HAVE MERCY THIS IS SOME OF THE BEST ROCK IVE HEARD AND IVE HEARD IT ALL."
3,Pyrex Prepware 11-by-14-Inch Cutting Board with Measurements,"It is easier to use than a ruler, but rolling is much better on marble."
1,This board will dull your knives,Do not use a good knife on this cutting board. America's Test Kitchen proved that you can dull a knife on this cutting board in less than 10 seconds!
4,A pretty good bag,"I have had my Hip Hop for a little over a year now. I did receive mine for free through a company promotion, not one I work for, so I did not pay retail which of course will influence how I feel about my bag.First off, I am rough with my bag. I toss it around and use it everyday and I travel with it for work. It has held up pretty well. The only spot I have an issue is right at the top the material has come loose from a seam. Its not bad and I can fix it but if I spent $50 on this I would be pissed.As others pointed out, the strap does bunch but its not really been an issue for more.I carry an HP 311 and this works great for that, I also throw a school book or two in there and they fit, but barely.Overall its a good bag. After checking prices online for bags I do see this as a value. I would buy one, since my first was free."
1,NO SUBTITLES!,"This is ridiculous - non-Greek speakers cannot watch this film. It might as well be removed from the list.Movies should at least be checked to have subtitles ""ON"" before they are uploaded to the Amazon site.Amateurs ..."
2,is in a foreign language - no subtitles,"This MIGHT be a good movie - however since it is not in English nor does it have subtitles (at least it doesn't when you watch it via Amazon instant videos), I only watched it long enough to realize I wasn't going to understand it. :-("
5,"A stunning, refined watch","My husband purchased this unique and utterly stunning watch for me over for the holidays. It's my second Baume Mercier and it is exceptional. I truly love the unique bezel and the diamond on the crown.The bezel is domed; the part that makes it distinctive is the left and right side of the sapphire bezel raises in an arc above the casing. The casing sweeps low in a curve holding the diamonds.The face is mother of pearl and has Arabic numerals in the 12, 3 and 9 position. The date is offered in the 6 position and is rather small. Some may find it a bit too small to read.This watch is rated to 30M, which means if it is splashed with water, you do not need to worry.The Diamant line is fairly new, I believe it was introduced in spring of 2005. It has a classic, yet modern look. I feel comfortable wearing this everyday."
2,Poor engineering makes it difficult to appreciate; some gems,"The sound quality is weedy and thin, making it hard to judge the individual performances...some beautiful tenor work from Adrian Brand, and the duets with Brand and soprano Helene Obadia, and those with Obadia and alto Madeleine Jalbert are heart-lifting. Not as big a performance as the Shaw."
5,Fib or Not? This game is great...and that's not a fib!,"This is a very fun, entertaining game. It's a great way to interact with and get to know others. We had a lot of laughs and surprises playing it. A bonus is that you can play it with as few as two people. Enjoy!"
1,Aw come on!,"I got a DVD player last week and Joshua Tree was one my top ten movies to get. Then I discover that Artisan have released it in fullscreen and not even in the proper title. Jeez, was I upset and deeply crestfallen.This is an outrageous action movie that very deserved a better release than it got. The Dolby 2.0 soundtrack may be better than the VHS but the musical score (awesome) sounds terrible and even ""chewed up"" in places. The fullscreen picture is even grainy and has too much color shimmer.All us fans can do is hope that the ever falling retail price of this DVD means is that Artisan is planning to do a proper widescreen release sometime in the future."
5,Kristian Alfonso - see more about her,"Too bad we do not get to see many movies with Kristian Alfonso. Great pairing with Lundgren. Two relatively under-rated stars. Action to rival a James Bond movie of circa 1992 vintage. For the money, this is a worthwhile purchase."
1,Wrecked movie!,"Why oh why is this in pan and scan only. This is a 2.35:1 framed movie and the well balanced and well composed cinematography is completely ruined on this DVD. About half the movie is missing. I love Joshua Tree but I won't buy this DVD. Artisan must understand this simply won't do. Sadly, the only widescreen version out there is the Japanese Laserdisc. And that's LONG out of print."
1,TERRIBLE DVD OF A GREAT FILM,"Joshua Tree was one of the best action movies of the '90s and Artisan (who can usually be relied upon to make awesome DVDS) have given it a terrible transfer.All we get on this very poor and lazy release is a flat and static main menu, Dolby-Surround, a fullscreen trailer and THE ENTIRE MOVIE IN FULLSCREEN. UGH!This film is supposed to be in 2.35:1 but instead Artisan, for some reason, released it in a mutilated 1.33:1. This is not right. The directors vision of the film is the one that should be respected and seen by everyone. I advise you to wait for a more definative release of Joshua Tree (not Army of One). Joshua Tree is the REAL title.I really do hope that Artisan change their minds about this DVD and release a better version soon. Widescreen is the most important feature of ANY DVD released. But it is not present here so save your cash for a future release."
1,TOTALLY ACE MOVIE...,"...but a terrible DVD. The sound is plain old Dolby Surround and the movie is in fullscreen. I find this very annoying.I have always like Joshua Tree and looked forward to it's DVD release. I imagined widescreen, Dolby 5.1, trailers, commentaries and motion menus. But none of that ever happened. Artisan disappointed me SO MUCH with this poor and unimaginative release.I would like to start a campaign to get Artisan to change their minds. To get them to re-release this awesome film in widescreen. They must do this as this film totally rocks. Even the current cover art is painfully awful. A moody picture of a Joshua Tree would be better.One last thing. Amazon and the back of the DVD state that the running time is 102 minutes when it is actually the unrated 106 version. This version must remain intact in the future widescreen release."
1,FULLSCREEN SHOULD BE ILLEGAL ON DVD,Normally I would reccomend this DVD to you. But only in widescreen. Artisan have butchered an excellent action film. Leave this edition be.
1,Used to be a good film.,"I saw this as Joshua Tree. It had a different (and better) ending than the DVD. The action is seriously cool and proffesionally handled by BAFTA award-winning stunt co-ordinator Vic Armstrong. Joel Goldsmiths musical score will put you right into the emotion of the story and Dolph is remarkably stoic as Wellman Anthony Santee-the hero. George Segal turns in a good performance and Kristen Alfonso is a babe.But Artisans DVD is terrible. No widescreen (the AR of Joshua Tree is 2.35:1) and very bad Dolby 2.0 sound. The DVD is not even digital. Instead it is directly mastered from the VHS tape and is of the same quality. A single trailer is the only extra and it even advertises the film by its actual title. Not this Army of One nonsense.Anyways, this is a cool movie and I suggest you check it out sometime."
2,Lundgren a One Man Army????????,"Another spectacle from action star Dolph Lundgren who was made famous for his legendary fight with Sly Stallone in Rocky IV. Lundgren stars as escapes from the hands of the law only to lead them on a series of car chases and plot twists. I highly recomend you check out some of Lundgren good performances in Universal Soldier and Showdown in Little Tokyo, in which Brandon Lee rocks."
5,USA all the way!,"I received this product as a birthday present. I was really excited to try it, and so I did. Wow! This game is a blast! It is really fun! It teaches you about the USA. It also teaches you about being a detective and solving riddles. It also teaches you about spending your time wisely because as you travel around the USA, you use up fuel for your airplane. You're a detective and you're assigned a mission by the Chief (from the TV show). Something valuable has been stolen by one of Carmen Sandiego's crooks! You are the only person who can stop that crook. But the more cases you solve, the harder they get! Buy this product! Good luck, Gumshoe!"
4,Very nice reading,"This is a book I love.It is a nice reading and keeps you aware of what happened in a given year. But it is very superficial and so, if you are looking for in-deep information on a particular event that took place in the last third of the century, try another book.Don't forget the Vol 1 and 2, this collection is really worth the price."
2,Disappointing -- Nothing More Than A Collection of Headlines,"What a disappointment this book was. It truly is nothing more than a regurgitation of a good newspaper's ""Year in Review"" section for each of the years covered. It simply lists one event after another. There is no attempt to analyze or put in perspective events, nor is there even a shred of a story thread to carry the reader.I haven't read the first two volumes in this series, but I can't imagine them being as bad as this one, else the author would never have received a contract to do this book. This work is an embarrassment to the author, the publisher, and the intellectuals in the United Kingdom."
2,Graduate students clipped newspapers?,"A very disappointing set of books, reads like strung together clippings of (primarily) political events from newspapers. Inconsistent in places, dead wrong in others, practically no synthesis. OK perhaps if you want an outline of some of the major events and when they occurred, but to get the significance and any depth of analysis, you'll have to look elsewhere. One of the strangest excuses for ""History"" I've ever read."
1,Dr DW Cameron,"Doesn't even get the basics right - I flicked through the book and luckily did not waste my money buying it - Hicky states continually (this not a typo) that the 2nd Brigade at Anzac was the first to land, when it is WELL KNOWN that it was 3rd Brigade. If you he can't even get this well known fact correct - what about the rest of it!"
4,Want to have the Bible book Revelation revealed?,"The day I met Dr. Lee on the airport in South Africa I thought he would be a person who are too educated to talk to. You see he have at least 10+ doctorate degrees, so the assumption is, one will have difficulties talking and understanding him. The truth - his is one wonderful down to earth person. And he really knows his Bible. So if you want to have the Bible Book Revelation revealed in a Bible study book commentary - easy to read and follow, then get this book - even if it is only for the very informative footnotes on the pages. I have to admit at first I did not like the many footnotes ( I skipped it), then I start reading them and found how Dr. Lee incorporates his knowledge in books, so that everybody can follow. In short - a very-good book!"
1,Looks much better in the picture....,"We ordered and received the Winsome Wood Nesting Tables in antique walnut. They are really heavy, so not very easy to use as occasional tables that you bring out when you need an extra table. As a permanent table that stays in the same place they would be fine. But for me, the nesting idea was the appealing part - I planned on putting them in a corner and bringing out a table when we had extra guests. These were way to heavy and awkward for that.The finish didn't look anything like the picture. That was the most disappointing part - they were really ""distressed"" and looked pretty rough and beat up. Not at all a nice looking walnut finish. I guess for the price I should have expected it. I won't bother to send them back, since shipping was more than the price of the tables. Overall, very disappointing."
3,So-so tables,"I ordered these tables for my daughter's first apartment. The finish on the tabletops is more like a ""Pier One"" finish, a bit distressed and the finish uneven. They are good sized and heavy, almost too heavy to be pulled out frequently for guests to use. All in all they are not bad, not great. They will serve their purpose for a 20 year old who will probably leave wet soda cans on them *sigh*"
3,"Very attractive, albeit a bit rustic looking.","Tables are very well suited to my more casual decor. They were very easy to assemble and there were no nicks or scratches. The finish is slightly uneven in spots, but does not diminish the overall attractiveness of the pieces."
5,Art DJ II Phono Preamp,Great solution to the missing phono input on most of today's receivers. Plug and play. Works great.
3,GOOD UNIT,PREAMP WORKS WELLS. THE CLIP LIGHT ON THIS UNIT IS SO HANDY. A POWER BUTTON WOULD HAVE ADDED ANOTHER STAR TO THIS PREAMP.
2,I returned this product because it was a used product and it was broken,I returned this product because it was broken and misrepresented. A new item would be just fine... I bought a replacement
4,great sounding phono preamp,"without this preamp, i could barely hear the music from playing a vinyl record thru my pioneer 919AH-k AV receiver, and the sound was weak and flat no matter how high of volume i used. with the DJ Pre II preamp, the record now plays with excellent loudness and hi-fidelity. the adjustable gain knob gives the ability to match the preamp output with the sensitively of the receiver. the instructions with the unit are very minimal. the are two lighted buttons: low cutoff filter, and capacitance adjustment, but there is no directions on how to determine the best setting, and i can't tell the difference whether the buttons are on or off. the unit is attractive and appears well made."
5,So happy my old Pre-Amp bit the dust,I did not realize what a piece of crap my old pre-amp was until I hooked this one up. Sounds great with no background hum or buzz. The blue light is a little bright and wish it had an 'off' switch. But those are the only cons.
3,On-Off switch,"Having a great old Technics SL-D20, I needed a preamp to connect to my Sony system. This works great but you must ground it to avoid the hum. Also, I was unaware that the preamp had no on/off switch - maybe it's OK to leave it on, but I need to find a simple convenient switch."
5,Great to hear albums again!,"The ART DJPre II Phono Preamp has been a great way to hookup my turntable to my new av/receiver and with the preamp, my old albums sound better then before. It is easy to use and the cost factor makes this a good choice for those not wanting to spend hundreds of dollars more on a receiver with phono inputs. Great product and good price makes listening to our record collection easy and affordable."
3,Sounds a little leanness.,"The product is well made, sound clean, bright but could be more fat. I have a Pyle PP999 that costs less than DJpre half price, and sounds much more warm. So, I prefer the Pyle PP999."
3,way too young for 8-year-olds!,"This book is supposed to be for 4- to 8-year-olds. It's actually for children much younger than 8. I'd say 5 to early 6 is the maximum age. I ordered it for my nephew who is almost 7, and it is way too young for him. Wish I'd known - now it's too late to order something else for him from Amazon and get it in time for X-mas without paying for expedited shipping!"
2,I'LL SAY NO,Disappointed with cd because only the title track was worth listening to. I expected that more than the one track would be something I'd like listening to.
4,I never lost my joy,"First time I listened to this CD track 4 resonanted, and resonated with me till my soul was humming.Part of the lyrcs say, ""I may have lost friends, loved ones, etc ... but through it all. I never lost my hope, I never lost my joy but most of all I never, ever lost my PRAISE"". That was like freshwater to the soul. If you been going through a difficult time and the only thing thats bringing you through is much prayer, bible reading and meditation then this song is for you. Get somewhere where you can turn up the volume, sing along and break into PRAISE."
3,Skipping During Concert,"We really enjoy the music and the testimonies; however, we've tried two different copies, and both copies have skipped during the concert section as soon as we played them for the first time. I would love to have a good copy of this DVD, but will not be paying any more in order to find it."
2,Okay cd... has a bunch of repeats...,"Well, Brooklyn Tab has always been a great choir, but what I can't understand is why they aren't creative anymore. For the past couple of albums, BTC has ""sampled"" other gospel artist work. ""Spirit Fall Down"" is by Luther Barnes, ""The Lord Thy God"" is by Straigh Gate Mass. Their other albums have even more samples by Richard Smallwood [Total Praise], Kurt Carr [For Every Mountain]... the list can go on. Don't get me wrong, they sound beautiful, but what ever happened to the days of being creative? I thought that God inspires people to be originators, not imitators and certainly not duplicators."
3,Ah...no,"May God bless all of you who are encouraged by the songs on this cd, please continue to enjoy it. Everybody have different tastes and this is only my opinion.When Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir puts out a new cd I believe I'm like the first person to purchase it. I love this choir.Unfortunately I listened to ""I'll Say Yes"" twice, and have already stashed it away.I'm waiting with eager anticipation for their next project though!"
4,The spiritual journey continues...,"along with page-turning suspense and thought-provoking spiritual insights! I meant it when I said Nancy Moser's Mustard Seed Series deserves shelf space with spiritual warfare classics such as those of Frank Peretti. The Temptation continues the saga of the characters we have come to know and love since the first book, The Invitation. Moser makes you care about these people, and she drives home the Biblical truth of the very real struggle between good and evil. You'll have a hard time putting this one down...and you'll come away with the assurance that the victory is the Lord's. An enjoyable, fascinating read!"
3,Poor quality,"Pretty attractive, but the sand sticks so timer stops. When it does flow after a vigorous shaking, it runs for over 20 minutes. I'm returning it."
1,"Sand doesn't flow, don't buy it.","I bought this timer for my children to time their piano practice. It does not work at all. When we first received it, the sand flowed but there was always a little bit left at the end, and we had to tap it to make all the sand drip down. Then it stopped working completely after only a week!! The sand was stuck and it did not flow at all. It's a piece of junk, we are throwing it out. Don't buy this product."
4,very cute!,"This is a very cute earring, prefect a little girl, teen, or a fun night out! I got it for my best friend's younger sister, and she absolutely loves it"
1,does not work,"I bought the this headset for my fiance as a valentine's day present thinking that it would work with his Treo 650, wrong. We have tried everything and I am now looking for a way to return it. it was a total waste of money."
2,Treo headset,"I found the headset device to be flimsy and of poort quality. After two weeks of use, the rotating ear holder would spin around the headset so that it would not stay in place. If I held my head in one position to balance it, the sound would be fine. I hadn't had much opportunity to try out the other features."
4,Off Brands creamier,"This is a great inexpensive way to get daily facial moisture. This one is a little greasier than the off brands, but once it is massaged in works wonderfully."
2,"musk fragrance present, when used on hands","There is a significant musk smell, but the lotion works great. Should be aware if you are allergic to Musk fragrance/natural odors? from the lotion... Great repair for skin. But if allergic to musk, be aware."
2,Disappointed,This lotion is not as I remember. Seems more liquidy than creamy. My skin is still dry the next day
5,"Creamy, not oily","My wife and I have used this for years. For some reason it seems discontinued in stores, but it's a rich cream that isn't oily. I have hyper-sensitive skin and this works well."
1,Smelly stuff,"I had high hopes for this product after reading all of the wonderful reviews. Maybe I'm just overly sensitive, but the smell makes me absolutely queasy. I used it on my hands and I could still smell it after I washed my hands three times."
4,ok for dry skin,"I have dry skin to begin with, and living in a place where it gets unbearably cold in the winter does not bode well with my skin, and especially my hands. And this is a cream I have come to like a lot. I dont think anybody will have problems moisturizing their skin. This cream I admit is pretty intense and can feel greasy after applying, but it does absorb after some time.. but I guess this wait is what turns some people off from the product.I actually recommend St. Ives lotion.. I just recently tried it, and I think it works much better than this."
5,Healing Codes for the Biological Apocalypse,This is the first book I've read and owned by Dr. Leonard Horowitz. It is very informative and captivating as well as eye-opening. Everyone should own and read a copy of this book.Healing Codes for the Biological Apocalypse
3,This book is middle of the road at best!,"While this is not a totally bad book on the whole, it's not a really good book either. The authors did some useful work in documenting and exsposing the plot to unleash a Biological Apocalypse, and made it seem like a real possibility. IMO the title is misleading. I was expecting far more informnation about the Healing Codes and how specifically to apply them. For a book titled as such, with 537 pages there was very little information concerning the Healing Codes. A better title would have been: The Biological Apocalypse Exposed. In that case I would have given it 4 stars instead of three."
3,scary offbeat book best at documenting about planned plagues,"i heard this guy at a talk, he feels we must use biospiritual warriorism to offset planned assault on the public by huge powers that be. worth a read and share with your friends."
5,And The Truth Shall Set You Free!,"Wow! Sick and Tired of Being Sick and Tired? I am! Beware of the Neo Con New World Order Agenda! It includes Depopulation of the planet and they have been at work, covertly for decades accomplishing just that.Herein lies the evidence of their deeds and amazing new scientific evidence of a formerly hidden knowledge of energy, and how it can be applied as a medicine to heal!Energy Medicine!"
4,Truth Stranger than Fiction,"The aphorism that titles this review is apt. In his well researched and documented story, the author must nevertheless blend the objective and the subjective, including both interpolation and extrapolation. In such a state, one can only wonder: ""Did all this really happen?"" We may never know, but this book is an amazing read. Mr. George Crile earns a sincere ""Well done!"" Given the eclectic and bizarre nature of the characters dipicted in this immense theater, it is clear: ""All the world's a stage...."""
3,That Charlie could do this is incredible,"This book discusses a part of politics that I have little knowledge. It is the story of a minor character in the US political process Charlie Wilson, a Democratic United States Representative from the 2nd congressional district in Texas. Before Charlie Wilson came, the US was already supplying some aid to the mujahideen. However soon the Pakistan's military ruler General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, started pushing for more financial aid to help them. Charlie Wilson decides to help the mujahideen in Afghanistan against the Soviet invaders. This book shows how mostly because to his efforts with a CIA officer Gust Avrakotos, a major international military supply program occurred involving many other countries including Saudi Arabia, Israel and Egypt.I found it incredible and interesting but it contained too much trivia about the characters. It should have been much shorter."
4,Charlie Willsons War,I saw the movie and decided I wanted to read more about Willison. The book was very good. It is amazing how much power one man can have in our government and nobody in the USA really knew what was going on. I didn't really like the way the author would start a subject then jump to somthing that was supposed to be related to the subject.
4,CIA ?,"1 Was Charlie Wilson a CIA stalking horse?2 Was Charlie's War a CIA operation?3 Did the CIA see Charlie as a useful tool after he got annual funding increased from five million to ten million for the Mujahedin?4 Was Joanne Herring a CIA agent assigned to channel Charlie's sympathy for the Mujahedin to the CIA's ends?5 Was Gust Avarakotos, instead of a rogue agent, actually a company man?6 Were Joanne Herring and Gust Avarakotos assigned to guide this alcoholic, good time congressman to accomplish CIA goals, while affording the Administration, CIA and State Department deniability if relations with the Soviets blew up.The above would explain the unbelievable blind spot the Government had while tremendous sums of money were diverted to the Afgan Resistance"
2,Revisionist History,"Only a New Deal Democrat could get such a puff piece writtin about him. If Charlie Wilson had been a Goldwater Republican (or a ""right wing conservative"" as such people are described throughout) this would have been a very different book. More revisionist history from one of those unbiased producers at 60 Minutes."
3,Charlie's ego,Good book but I can't tell were the truth and the ego split. Also it was interesting in the fact that I lived in Aliquppa.
2,Revisionist Claptrap,"If you're looking for a book that fully and impartially chronicles the Soviet defeat in Afghanistan, look elsewhere. ""Charlie Wilson's War"" is nothing more than an attempt by a liberal journalist to concoct some positive role in America's Cold War victory for the Democratic Party. The author scracely mentions Ronald Reagan's name at all and each use of the word ""conservative"" is preceded by ""ultra"", ""arch"" or ""extreme."" There is a whole chapter devoted to ""Right Wing Crazies."" Afghanistan seems to have defeated the Soviets despite the Reagan administration who just coincidentally happened to occupy the White House at the time of the Soviet collapse. Sure. Maybe 10 years from now this guy will author a book about how the War on Terrorism was actually won by Tom Daschle and Ted Kennedy despite the meddling of George W. Bush and his band of wacky archconservative right wing crazies. Where's Charlie Wilson when you need him, huh?"
5,One of my all time favorite books,Terrific book that reads novel. An amazing story of how things get done or don't get done in our government. I was also surprised that this book is without a political message or lean of any sort. The depth of research and writing skills of the author are unparalleled. With our governments complexity and tendency for political grandstanding and infighting its amazing how Charlie Wilson found a way to make this huge covert operation come together.
2,Book/Movie Closely Connected,"This is really good book that one should read before seeing the movie (my mistake). The two are so closely related that it almost is not worth reading after seeing it on film. It does not change the fact, however, that it is highly entertaining and well-written."
4,Charlie Wilson's War,If you enjoyed the movie - you will like the book. The book provides much more character development and in-depth insight to the political aspects both at home and globally. It's a very eye opening & frightening look at how one man with an agenda can manipulate our govenment.
5,Scary but outstanding,"Now this one I couldnt put down. It is scary to think one person almost inadertantly can have this much power in our government and I am sure many others do as well and I lived in Texas at the time and didnt recall the guys name. I guess he flew under radar. Fascinating account of the beginnings of our present war in Iraq and Afghanistan and how once again our government made a deal with the devil and the boots on the ground for the CIA new it, told their superiors and well, as they say the rest is history. But if you want an outstanding read on politics out of control, bravery, treachery you cant beat this one and its true - no novel here. Great read."
4,The impact of One Man's Actions,"What would the world be like today if Charley Wilson did not do what he did in Afghanistan? Less lives lost?, a stable regime in Kabul?, no 9/11? I sincerely do not have the answer. I lived in Central America all throughout the 1980s where Charley Wilson played a smaller role in overturning a Soviet supported regime than he did in Afghanistan. Most Nicaraguans praise what the Reagan administration did to get rid of the Sandinistas and say that it would have never happened if the Contras were not armed and supported by the U.S. But again, who would have predicted the Sandinistas would return via the ballot box. Who would have predicted that the vacumn left by the Soviets from Afghanistan would have left the world a much more dangerous place. What does Charley Wilson think of the results of his efforts?"
1,"Poorly written, excrutiatingly detailed","This book was really interesting at first, but I couldn't keep reading beyond a few hundred pages. The author keeps saying the same things over and over and over again (I got it, Charlie Wilson was tall and good looking, Gust was working class, etc.) He restates the same things so many times, it seems like he things readers are stupid and can't remember anything from prior chapters.At first, I enjoyed learning about the inner workings of the CIA and the House of Representatives, etc. But this book is so tedious, I can't summon the attention span to finish reading it.I almost always read a book before seeing the related movie because I like to read the more detailed story. In this case I am hoping the movie does a much better job of just telling the story without all of the extra noise and redundancy."
2,Edutainment - lacks balance,"The problem with this book is that it lacks balance and appeals to people who love tall tales. These kind of stories are rife in any business that is covert, especially the arms trafficking business.Lots of flash but the Iran Contra scandal is juicier--everybody knows the US aided the mujadadeen--so what?But an interesting read."
2,Great start...Bad Finish,"The first 100 pages of this book were entertaining and gave a nice background to the major players in this book but from that point the book started to bore me and it seemed to be repeating itself. I dont really recommend this book, but however if you like the story i would suggestCharlie Wilson's War (Full Screen)or The History Channel DocumentaryThe True Story of Charlie Wilson (History Channel)"
4,Stranger than Fiction and Frightening,"The events described in the book are so bizzare that, at first, I thought it was fiction. Then I was frightened. According to the book US foreign policy is ran by relatively low levels operatives, a congressman and a CIA agent who is not in good terms with his superiors. CIA comes through as rather inept without strong leadership. Indeed it was ""Charlie Wilson's War"" and nobody was minding the store, i.e. the true long term interests of the United States. By naive application of adage ""the enemy of my enemy is my friend"", these guys created a major threat for the country and nobody seems to be accountable.My main criticism of the book is that it is far too detailed and, as result, too long. For example, we need not know all the specifics about the numerous girl friends of Mr. W. (but then, sex sells!) A book at a third of its size could convey the main issues equally well as the current detailed version."
4,should be in every american household.,This book tells an immensly entertaining story of how the CIA help the mujahadeen push back the invading russian forces in Afghanistan. In the 80's this campaign by Charlie Wilson and his love for the muj. actually helped defeat communism and create the re-birth of ismlamic fundamentalism. The novel flows so smoothly and the characters in this book are truly one of a kind. The amount of detail expressed in this book about how washington strings are pulled and played is incredible. Buy this book.
4,"Very Interesting...just like a spy movie, but it's real.","A round of applause for this author for his research. A lot of these things that happenned I thought only happened in movies. I enjoyed the audio book, because the narrarator was exceptionally good. Anyone who is interested in Afghanistan I think must read this book as they will understand the country's politics more. Why four stars and not five? The final 2 discs were a bit long, but that should not be taken away from the rest of it."
3,"Interesting, but way too long","This is a very interesting book filled with an insiders look into the CIA and covert operations. That said, it was hard for me - a book worm - to finish this book because it kept meandering all over the place with no clear, central storyline or continuity of direction. This will probably be one of the rare instances where the movie will probably be better than the book."
3,"A great story, but biased","This is a fascinating story. Wilson is a a larger than life character and his story would be a great read if it was fiction - the fact that it actually happened makes it all the more incredible. BUT, the author has been charmed by Wilson. It is clear that Crile sees his subjects as unlikely heroes and anyone who tried to get in their way is inevitably described as misguided, selfish and/or stupid.The fact that one congressional zealot was able to hijack American foreign policy through illegal deals and old fashioned Congressional horse trading - not because anyone had thought the issues through but because Wilson sensed it was his destiny - is not heroic. It's terrifying. And Wilson should be in jail.I am buying this book for a number of my friends. It's a great story. It's very well told. But even though Crile clearly wants us to walk away humming the national album and thinking of Good Ole Charlie, I couldn't shake my feeling of disgust over the whole thing."
4,Charlie Wilson's War,"I ordered the book ""Charlie Wilson's War"" gently used. It was in great condition. I was trying to read the book in time for my book club so wish it had arrived a few days faster but it was within the 10 day shipping window."
1,Remember 9/11?,Charlie a hero? Let see. CIA helps Taliban gain military power... Taliban expels Russia... Taliban host Binladen... 9/11... US invades Taliban...Who is the hero?
3,WRONG COVER!!,The book is in nearly perfect condition.It took me several flip throughs before I realizedwhy the cover said Gracy Paley memories and I had orderedCharlie Wilson's War for a book. Eventually I came to the logical yet speculative assumption that the printer must've loaded up the wrong covers for this book when assembling the thing. All but the outer cover is indeed the book I ordered. I've never seen the book before i ordered it. Unless of course this is a CIA 'coverup' so no one really knows you're reading Charlie Wilson's War.....Mike
2,Gets Bogged Down in the Details,"This book tells an interesting piece of modern history. However, Grile just puts in too many unnecessary details. It is not necessary to give the biography of every character in the story, especially minor characters. Grile gives the background of every woman Charlie brings with him to Pakistan. This really disrupted the flow of relevant information.Also, this book was written in 2003. Five years later America still has Soldiers in Afghanistan. It makes the book feel premature. It is hard to provide perspective when we don't know what the final outcome is.Overall, the information was ok but at times it felt baised. My main criticism was that the text was too dense and included too many irrelevant details."
2,Not too tempting,"Riley Jenson is closing in on the bad guys in this one and continuing all her sexual relationships but just like book 2 (Kissing Sin) this book did not do for me what book 1 (Full Moon Rising) did: suprise me, excite me and interest me. I think it's time for Keri Arthur to switch the story line to a different character or have Riley do more than re-act to the things that are happening in her life. Since I read the first 3 I will read the 4th book but I don't expect much."
4,Good book,"Keri Arthur is an excellent writer and I like the first book in this series, so I wanted to read more. Riley Jensen is a super gal."
4,Rilet Jensen,The product arrives in good order and speedily.The book is on of a sequel in the Riley Jensen Guardian series.
4,Just keeps gettin better & better,"The 3rd installment of the Riley Jenson series was as entincing as the first two novels. The story picks up where the 2nd book left off, Riley is about to find the person who has been behind all the cloning and who had kidnapped her. And like Misha said in the last book, she somehow knows this person. Filled with mystery, suspense, action, a dash of humor and of course sex, this novel lives up to its series. There is quite a bit more sex in this book than the other 2 that I can recall of, but it is not horribly done, it moves through somewhat quickly so you are not reading pages of people having sex. It moves on quickly to return to the plot. Overall a good read! Can't wait till the next one comes out at the end of the month!"
4,PERFECTLY GOOD READ BUT NOT AS STRONG AS THE OTHER TWO IN THE SERIES,"Keri Arthur set a high benchmark in terms of thrills and spills in her previous 2 books so this seemed a little lacklustre in comparison. Otherwise it is a good book with all of Arthur's trademark sexy, dark intensity, continuous action and imaginative array of otherworldly creatures.Despite the various oblique clues throughout all 3 books and a fair bit of thought on my part, the bad guy was not someone who even made it onto my shortlist so expect the author to keep you guessing right up until the end.Dont read this book unless you have read the other two."
5,Were/Vamp Riley and alot of plot action!!!,"I had great expectations for this book and all were fulfilled! I had read book 1 of the series and enjoyed it enough to get the second book. Loved the world building and the character development that each book brings. She, Riley Jensen, is a strong female werewolf/vamp mix.. but not superwoman type of heroine. As the world building explains, werewolfs have a very different attitude about sex. Many, or one lover, are the norm. *SPOILER* This one has alot of action, plot twists, sex and pretty major surprises all having to do with Riley's lovers and someones plan to genetically produce a perfect assassin army. Her boss is still trying to talk her into being a ""Guardian"" (supernatural cop) like her twin brother Rhoan, who just happens to be gay. One vamp she meets, Quinn, is old and very powerful....whoa, he is hot!"
4,Tempting tidbits,"Some have said that this book was when Riley's story started to pick up, I say, this is when Keri flicked the switch into overdrive. This book was sizzling sauciness at it's best!"
1,Are you kidding me?,"These are a HUGE inconvienience!! Toddlers do not have the dexterity to pull them out one at a time so, you end up with 20-40 of them in the toilet instead of the one or two recommended to flush. Then you get the joy of plunging your toilet! Wow, as if having a potty training toddler wasn't enough now I have to do toilet maintence everytime he goes to the bathroom with out my supervision! Thanks Kimberly Clark for giving me more do with my day!"
3,Waiting for an upgrade,"Yeah, that could have really been upgraded years ago, since it is almost 4 years since the first release. Quite limited capabilities of the troops, and the most frustrating - not a single battle is actually linked with a following one. They could have made a Division size front line, where you fight by a Battalion, so that you operate on a 9 Battalions wide front line:at least one would have space for maneuvering the troops, reserves, artillery (had there been one) etc, reinforcing one flank for attack and keeping another in defence, making it more realistic and exciting. Otherwise, still worth buying at least for the garage sale price..."
5,Pamphlet Concise on Controversial Matter,"Danny Shelton has written a clearly understandable and concise pamphlet on the Sabbath Day issue that he an Shelly Quinn elaborate on in ""The Anti-Christ Agenda"" book. Many people will be intimidated by a sizable book and getting the word out through this pamphlet, ""The Forgotten Commandment"" is a handy tool to persuade people to consider this important topic. Danny gets clearly to the issue in a way that will appeal to many."
1,Sucks,This product sucks!!dont buy it. you will be let down. Its a greases mess that will not come off and you will feel sticky for the rest of the day.Poor Poor Product!!
5,Best makeup remover ever!,My last jar lasted 3 years. Removes mascara perfectly.Seriously good stuff!You can't find it any more where I live. Sad
2,"may be fun for some, but I broke my arm on the first ride","I have ridden skateboards in the 80s, and currently ride longboards. I bought this with some birthday money earlier this year, and the first time I rode it, it hit a rock, the wheels locked up, and I flew foward, breaking my arm in the process. with all those wheels, you have to be very careful about any rocks in your path.My wife was extremely upset with me and the board, so i sold it locally on craigslist within the next 2 weeks. Never got to ride it more than once.I will stick with 4 wheels, although I bet this would be fun at a skatepark, or for someone who does not have an over-reacting wife/gf/mom/etc."
3,"One of many board types that do it well, but not great.","I skated on the traditional 1980's board and was ok. I grew up, moved out and such. Full circle brought me back to the boards. I got a long board. Sector 9. Loved it. kinda picked up where i left off from. Wanted to find something to do some better carving so i got a flowboard. Its a great concept and works for the most part. you need steady incline as well as room to carve/turn. This board does not allow much for straight riding. It feels great carving given you have those conditions. This is not a casual riding board. I would only recommend this board to people who are looking to carve specifically, Think of this board as a snowsled. it goes down hill only. You do the rest of the work.. Its a heavy board. I still give it a three though because given the right road this baby will do wonders. Just not too many my way at the moment..."
3,flowboard,My 9 and 7 year old grandsons love it but they say there is a learning curve. They have had it 3 weeks and haven't gone downhill yet but they like it for tricks.
2,aimed at budding Internet Marketeers,"Sterne touches in this book the many aspects of the WorldWide Web without going into details. This makes it a useful book for anyone new in this field, but in the end its content is too shallow for professionals."
2,"Very disappointing, just another ""how to build a web site""","I was really disappointed that someone who has such a rich set of experiences in the industry would write such a mediocre book. I didn't really learn anything new or gain any unexpected insights. There are 100 other ""how to build a web site"" books out there that have the same content and are undifferentiated from this.If you are really interested in a book that takes a novel and insightful approach to doing business on the web, check out Evan Schwartz' Webonomics."
5,A must read for any technology entrepreneur!,"I'm President/CEO/Founder of a custom software development house. This book has been my guide to growth. I've been reading it slowly so I can soak it all in, and it seems my company hits the same milestones and problems as Sandy's company did. It is like having a crystal ball to see how Sandy dealt with the issues at hand, and I can learn from her mistakes and from the correct decisions she made. For anyone self-financing their own technology company, don't miss this book. Sandy's writing style is so easy to understand. I felt like I was all alone in the issues I face until I read this book. Don't miss this - especially if you are a young female trying to build a multi-million dollar technology company."
5,"Sandy Kurtzig: A great CEO, Visionary and Mother!",I may be a little biased (I'm Sandy Kurtzig's son) but I have heard from hundreds of readers that this book has given them the inspiration to start and grow their own companies. I'm also following in my mother's footsteps as CEO of my own company: E-Benefits. I only hope I'm as successful!
1,Don't waste your money!,"I'm CFO of a fairly new e-commerce company and all I can say is that I've wasted several hours of my life that I will never get back after reading her book. She continually and erroneously predicts the demise of the Internet, keep in mind this book was published in 1994! She also has a technique she refers to as the flinch test as a means of pricing her software, she says, ""I told them that the price was 50 k"" if they didn't flinch ""per module"" if they didn't flinch ""per year."" It's bad enough that she employed these tactics but she even had the audacity to publish this! I don't know about you, but I would be furious if was one of her customers. I would suggest ""CEO Logic : How to Think and Act Like a Chief Executive"" it's much more relevant and up to date."
2,A mediocre book - weak by comparison to others,"As someone in the early stage of a high-tech startup, I have been reading many books for guidance. This was not one of the most helpful. The author came across as too self-serving. Also, given the later demise of ASK, I want her to tell me where she went wrong - that would be much more helpful. Women might want to glance through this, as it shows it can be done - just take care not to end up bankrupt like the author. If you want a really helpful book, read ""Engineering Your Start Up"" by Michael Baird instead."
3,Gave it as a gift.....,"I got this for my dad since he does a lot of research on WW2 for people. From what he has told me in using it, and from my own flipping of hte pages, it seems this book was not put together really well, and in fact contradicts itself on occassion. I would imagine the publisher would be to blame for those types of things."
2,weak bottom stud,"the side with the lone nut which usuallyy goes to the bottom, that stud broke as the tech was tightening the nut, the nut went half way before the stud broke. it had to be welded since i had thrown away the original hence the reason why i did not return it. so far the part is working ok despite the welding"
4,cute story,I didn't expect much when i got this. its a cute story. it's ok. Can't say much for the film quality but the one in the red dress on the cover was pretty good compared to the other actors.
1,Purchased 1&2 - Thank Goodness I Didnt Open 2,This movie was so predictable that it was funny. My Husband & I purchased 1&2 for what was supposed to be a tame movie evening. It was so tame that I almost fell asleep. Wearing a T-shirt with the name of your production company in a movie scene - T-A-C-K-Y. Please spend a bit more $$ next time and stay BEHIND the camera. The young pastors role was not believable at all....Thank goodness I didnt break the seal on #2....I was able to return it as a result
5,One of the Very best in Devotional Books Available,"I'm an unrepentant fan of Joe Stowell! I just can't help myself...the man lives what he writes, speaks, preaches, and communicates. And ""Strength for the Journey"" is just such an ""index"" of all his many encounters with the living and the Giver of Life, our gracious God.Fitted with a catchy title, a Scripture passage, a moving devotional meditation, and a closing convicting thought, Stowell really does help the reader find ""Strength for the Journey."" All three-hundred sixty-five days of the year are covered, and none of them are lack-luster, boring, or trite. I've read the book (now) from cover-to-cover, and it is one of the best.Get it for yourself, and a few friends."
3,Well it was bound to be subjective and patchy,"Given how thin the book it, it was bound to be quite superficial and selective in its treatment of authors. I have no problem with that. I read this book to get some ideas on who might be good to read now having grown up on the classsics like Chandler, Ross MacDonald and Agatha Christie. Because he does write some quite detailed analyses ( in particular his treatment of Chandler ), the book was bound in other places to just become a litany of ""I like this one and the plot is..."". That was OK. It was what I wanted. No Harlan Coben was fine with me too. In fact I liked the brief chapter where he put the knife in the authors he really didn't care for best of all.So, a short book, very subjective, very superficial in parts, very patchy in its coverage. But still pretty interesting for all that."
1,Too Narrow a Focus,"When I got this book, I thought, ""Finally, a book on thriller."" Unfortunately, what I discovered was that the author did what everyone else does when talking about thriller--talk about the crime subgenre as if that's all a thriller is. What happened to the action-adventure thrillers, the medical thrillers, the political thrillers, the romantic thrillers? There's at least a dozen thriller subgenres, but you wouldn't know it from this book. From a book about Thriller, I would have expected more than a discourse on crime fiction.And why are so few women writers even mentioned? I think I could count the number on one hand.Unfortunately, this book continues the myth that all thrillers are about crime when they're not. It has too narrow a focus for anything more than one star."
1,"Trivial, mindless, and downright useless...","Once again, I am equally shocked and disgusted that the masses are still flocking to Hollywood's examples of sophomoric comedies. I'm ALL for a good laugh, but it seems that many believe that comedy could only exist without creativity and thought. As is the trend in most recent comedies, ""Deuce Bigalow"" is rife with childish potty humor that one would expect to find only in the schoolyards of middle school preteens. In place of wit, and unique humor, we now are expected to laugh at situations that are in whole simply gross and disgusting. We've replaced and accepted talented and creative comedy writers with hacks who use a predictable formula of revolting toilet humor to entertain. What's more shocking than Hollywood's distribution of this banal material, is our acceptance and approval of it."
3,charmed,i was watching this movie tonight.. it's pretty funny.. an entertaining watch.I noticed something and was wondering if anyone else noticed... the house that the really tall chick lived in.. was that the house from charmed.. it lookes exactly the same.. what do others think?Ez
5,Buy it off of Pay Preview,"I'm a huge Rob Schneider Fan I love all of his work and try to catch him on SNL when I can. The fact is that this movie did have a pretty thin plot, but that didn't even hinder the Laugh Factor it was probably the funiest movie by Rob Schneider that he has done yet, it comes close to others, but with age comes wisdom, Rob Schneider has learned what the people want and throws it off without a hitch.This is Off the record, on the QT, and very HUSH HUSH!"
3,Deuce Bigalow is hilarious,"Big Daddy and Waterboy were hilarious hits. Rob Schnieder had a supporting role, and a hilarious one at that, in each of them. All of that pales in comparison to his role in Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigalow. If you are looking for a laugh a minute movie, this is the one to get."
3,Funny Movie,"This is a movie that is full of comedy, but you really must listen in order to catch some of the jokes. If you're easily offended, do not watch this movie! If you just looking for a funny movie full of spoofs and dirty jokes, then this is for you. There are gems here, to be sure. The basic theme, that the best kind of sexual attention is non-sexual in origin, deserves applause. And Eddie Griffin and Arija Bareikis put in utterly likable performances as Deuce's pimp and girlfriend. Funny but appears to have been rushed through production. Here, the plot isn't generated by Deuce Bigalow, it happens *to* him. Given that Rob Schneider wrote the film, it's odd that he forgot to write himself a character."
5,"Worth Barrowing, Renting, or Buying","Deuce Bigalow is not the funniest movie of all time; but it's hard to resist craking at least a smile when you hear such phrases as ""Man Whore"" and ""Mangina."" For all it's Un PC like qualites; it's an endearing movie that may polk fun at the shortcomings we all have, but also shows that we can still live happily and be loved despite them. That is the true message of this film. All the people who rated this movie less than at least 3 stars should go and find themselves something called ""A SENSE of HUMOR."""
4,Hilarious,"Rob Schneider came from the best ""family"" of Saturday Night Live actors. Most of them have had their own feature length films...what about Rob? It was a bit of a wait...but it was worth it. Deuce was one of the best laugh riots to come out since Happy Gilmore. Rob was wonderful, but Eddie Griffin stole every seen that he was in. Griffin's ... speeches were the highlight of the film. If you enjoyed Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore this will not dissappoint...it was the first DVD that I purchased. The only thing that kept this from getting a 5 is that it could have used more features on the DVD version...but the movie itself makes up for it."
3,GOOD AN AVERAGE,"Adam Sandler is one of the producers and Scheneider himself helped top write the history. The resulta was an average comedy movie, with some good sequences and delivering good moments. Schneider's acting was the high point, in my humble opinion, securing the whole film upon him."
4,Side Splitting Stuff,"I was recommended this DVD by a friend, and my estimation in his choice of judgement has increased dramatically. My wife, not known for her love of movies of this kind, gave me the usual, ""I hope thats not a comedy"" look. However I was in for a pleasant surprise, not only was I getting immense pleasure from watching the movie, but I even noticed that the wife was also enjoying this comedy feast. A simple story, followed up with some great acting, and a good script ...... totaly hilarious. So impressed were we, that when it finished we popped it on and watched it again. I certainly would not hesitate in owning this movie .... in fact whilst I'm writing this, I may just watch it again! Go get it, you won't be disappointed."
5,One of the best comedies I've ever seen!,"I found this movie to be absolutly hilarious.If you are one for liking totally grotesque humor then I guarentee you will love this movie.If you liked ""Theres something about Mary"" then you will probably appreciate this movie, because they share the same type of humor.I also liked the movie not only for its humor but also that there was a point to the movie.Sometimes I find that comedies lack a point, but this movie definatly had a point, an underlying love story.I think most people would enjoy this movie, it is made for almost anyone over 13.People of all ages will enjoy it!=)"
3,This movie is funny but the dvd is ok,"This movie is funny but the dvd is ok, not many cool features it is just kinda dull."
1,Rubbish Rubbish Rubbish!!!,"I am so sorry I spent the money buying this DVD , all I want to do is get rid of it. It has to be the worst I have ever seen , it was like a poor attempt at making a Naked Gun movie. Forget it , it is rubbish!"
2,Don't waste your money,"After seeing the previews, I thought it may stand a chance of being funny, however, 10 minutes into it I realized that the only funny parts were the ones shown in the previews. Although it had the potential to be a good movie, it fell short. There were too many cheap sexual jokes and the cop obsessed was out of place. I recommend not wasting your money."
4,I Never Said My Tastes Couldn't Be Questioned...,"....I loved it. It is flat out funny, I particularly liked the 'man-whore' tips from homeboy Eddie Griffin. The moovy is done so you'd get a kick outta the gags later on, and on successive viewing. Don'chu expect an expert analysis from my camp about the moovy. We cawn't do it, we're too busy laughin'..."
4,Have To Admit I Enjoyed This,"I hate to admit this but I liked this crude movie, at least the first time I saw it. Yes, it's crass, crude, stupid and whatever but it's generally likable and a funny movie in many spots.Rob Schneider does a fine job playing this amiable loser. Several scenes are just laugh-out-loud funny. The female interest, Arija Bareikis, is not someone I was familiar with but I liked her wholesome looks. William Forsythe plays the villain and, of course, he's over-the-top. The film had a nice soundtrack, a lot of familiar rock tunes.As with most modern comedies, this gets carried and a little stupid at the end but, overall the film is good low-grade fun (and I mean ""low grade!"")"
1,Don't Bother,"Teens will like this humor, but I'm past this crap! Try Animal House or Blazing Saddles if you want to chuckle!"
4,NOT BAD,"IF YOU LIKED THE WATERBOY, AUSTIN POWERS OR ANY OTHER MOVIES WITH SNL ALUMN IN IT YOULL LIKE DEUCE BIGALO IT WAS A FUNNY MOVIE WITH OUTRAGIOUS CHARACTERS AND FUNNY PLOT LINES YOULL BE SURPRISED AT THE END"
3,Deuce Bigalow,I got the DVD about 2 weeks ago at a local Sames store.I'm not sure how they got the movie weeks before it was due out.But anyway the DVD seems to have some sound problems.The back ground music can not be heard unless you turn the tv or sound system all the way up.I took the first one back and got another but it also had the same problem.Other then the sound it is a very funny movie and is one you can watch over and over
2,Political correctness killed what could have been great,The major problem with this film is that it attempts to be sympathetic to women. Commendable... as women are certainly deserving of greater respect and consideration than is generally afforded them in society at large.BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO FEEL SYMPATHETIC! I wanted to laugh my a-- off which certainly Rob Schneider is capable of. And despite there being a few funny scenes overall the movie just doesn't work.What a waste.
3,Deuce Bigalow,"It has laughs if you like Rob Schneider's sense of humor. He does try to bring out the best of people and that's a plus. If you like off the wall comedy, this is for you."
1,Amazing it was released at all.,"I have seen a lot of movies and I definitely vote this one the worst of them all. I can't even begin to desribe how mind numbingly boring, predictable, and contrived this movie is. I didn't laugh once. Hand cleaning cesspools is vaslty preferrable to watching this movie again."
4,Rob's 3rd best movie.,"If you like The Hot Chick and The Animal. You will like this movie. It's Rob's 3rd best film in my opinion. Funny movie and can be watched over and over again. He has to get money for a fish tank, for someone's house he's watching. What better way then to become a gigolo. He get's the worst women in the world of course. Worth having."
4,Hilarious!,"This movie is freakin' hilarious! It's one of the funniest things I have EVER seen. The plot is simple. A fish tank cleaner, Deuce, (Rob Schneider) is hired to clean the fish pond of a wealthy gigolo, Antoine (Oded Fehr, The Mummy). But Deuce notices that a very rare fish in the fish tank in the house is very sick, so Antoine asks Deuce to stay in his house for a couple of weeks while he's away on business and take car of his ill fish. When Deuce causes $1000's of damage to Antoine's house, he looks for a quick source of cash and resorts to ""male-whoring"". Just about everything in this movie is funny."
1,Not So Great,"ILuv I1055. I've owned this for two years. Initially it worked fine and still does work for the Ipod interface using a 80GB Ipod. But after only four plays of DVD movies total, I went to use again again only to find that it can't find the disk. Tried several DVD's with no response each time. I also tried audio CD's with the same result. I emailed ILuv and got a form response about whether or not it was in warranty, which it wasn't. I emailed them back looked for an objective quote for repair and was ignored. No response ever more from them."
1,"I LUV PORTABLE MEDIA TABLET I1055 7"" TFT ACTIVE MATRIX SCREEN.","I AM WAITING FOR I LUV TO REPLACE THIS UNIT, VIDEO DOES NOT WORK WITH AN 80GB VIDEO IPOD,I ONLY USED IT ONCE, IT NEVER WORKED THE WAY IT WAS SUPPOSED TO RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX, THE DVD PLAYER SUDDENLY STOPS AND RESTARTS ON A DIFFERENT CHAPTER, I THINK THE QUALITY MUST BE HIT AND MISS, I UNDERSTAND THEY FIXED MOST OF THESE PROBLEMS IN THE NEW 8.4 INCH VERSION WHICH JUST CAME OUT FROM READING OTHER REVIEWS SO I WOULD BUY THAT UNIT INSTEAD. THE SCREEN IS NOT THAT BAD FOR THE PRICE BUT THIS UNIT APPEARS TO HAVE QUESTIONABLE QUALITY."
5,This iLuv is awsome!,I really like this product. The picture quality is great and I love being able to watch my videos from my ipod on a larger screen. The only criticism I have is that a carrying case should have been included for the price of the item.
3,Only works with older version of iPod,"I love the price, and the how well this product sits on the headrest. However, you have to undo the velcro straps every time you want to access the ipod - the controls on the iLuv don't control the iPod. Also, the TV OUt function only works with the previous version of the iPod Video."
2,No ipod controls!! Bulky!,"This device is much bulkier than it needs to be. But an even worse offence is that the device cannot control the ipod. The ipod plugs in to the back, and you have to turn the unit around to reach the back to operate the ipod. It is the most ridiculous thing when you have turned off the power to the video unit; then turn it around and find that the ipod is still playing and will continue playing forever unless you turn that off too."
2,"Great Picture, Bad Battery Life","It's a wonderful ideal product but charge this thing and take on a trip. I was using it on airplane and as soon we were told electronics can be used, I turned on the I-Luv and about 5 mins later, the battery went dead as the item has done over and over."
1,Do not buy this,"The screen is terrible when view movies through the iPod. Picture quality is really bad when compare to the iPod built-in screen. The DVD feature is OK. It does not play DivX which is a let down. If you are thinking of buying this unit for the iPod integration, you will be very dissapointed. Also, the unit itself is very thick and very hard to handle, though the picture cleverly hides the thickness of the thing. Great job iLuv's Photographer. DO NOT BUY !"
4,Good Product,This is a neat device and I use it quite often. It is a little bulky but all of the features make up for it.
3,good dvd to get to know more of ali's life as a boxer!,"a bit disappointing...! Hoped to get more archive-information and images of all the fights which ultimately got him to the top and made him world-champion, again and again!"
2,A typical 90s Marvel,Not a bad story in and of itself. However it's nothing more than a typical crossover between two hot properties at the time. On the plus side it introduces Gambit's wife Belladona and sets the stage for a lot of the mutant Cajun's future development. On the downside it's somewhat tied into a confusing subplot from Ghost Rider at the time. A good read but there are better things featuring both the X-Men and GR out there.
4,An exciting blend of technology and Marine spirit,"AX Wykat in this novel introduces the reader to an exciting blend of technology and marine spirit, pitted against a global tapestry of disarray, terrorism, and tribalism. The novel weaves plausible plot lines with detailed descriptions of how technology and warriors come together on missions. The story lines clearly demonstrate the global nature of the current struggle. The best part is that the Author has left himself the ability to introduce future versions of this series, and clearly the series would translate neatly to a cinematographic treatment in a tv series or movie."
1,Not Satisfied at all,"I was amazed to see a wooden chess board for that low price on net and bought it. But, after I recived it, it looked a lot smaller than what I expected (But that's fine for that price) and then when I tried to pin those things in the board, I couldn't do more than 12. They didn't fit in those holes and even don't have space to atleast to let it be there though didn't fit properly. So it was just a waste. It will be a good product, unlike mine, if the toy you pick is designed so that you can start playing. Whether you enjoy the game or not, that's a different story."
5,Love! Best book EVER!!,"Love,love,LOVE this series I couldn't put it down. So inspiring as well. I wish the series had even more books!"
5,One the the best and most impacting book I've ever read!,One of my friends gave me this book telling me to read it. After I finished I had to buy all the others in the series. Caitlin was my role-model and she will be yours too when you read this amazing book. Her faith in Christ helps her in any situation. A great book for any teenage girl.
2,Too Inappropriate,This book was too inappropriate to be pleasant to read. It features all too many disturbing content. I certainly don't appreciate the drinking and party scenes. I would never suggest to his to any child.
5,review of a teenage girl,"I loved this book. I read it in a day, I just couldn't put it down. Caitlin dealt with things that girls face in real life every day. The situations were described perfectly and Caitlin's emotions and feelings were real. I could totally identify with her desire to be known and accepted and loved, even if it were for the wrong reasons. All of us have the desire to be loved by someone and noticed. The despair and pain she feels when she is rejected and used was totally gut-wrenching. So many times I have encountered these same situations in my short life and it's awesome that a writer has the talent to identify with so many young girls and get through to their hearts the way Melody Carlson did mine. But be warned, you just might cry!"
4,Fantastic Book!,"I have read a few of books by Melody Carlson and have enjoyed them but Diary of aBecoming Me (Diary of a Teenage Girl: Caitlin, Book 1)by Melody Carlson just blew me away. Ms. Carlson has been hailed as the ""voice of teens"" today and I have to agree - with this book she nailed it straight on!It's been quite awhile since I've been a teenage girl but Ms. Carlson's book took me back to those days of growing, maturing, and trying to find oneself. It was absolutely amazing! I'd liken her to today's version of Judy Blume but Ms. Carlson far exceeds that comparison. She has been able to capture the essence of teenage girls, their triumphs and struggles as they walk the path towards womanhood and combine it with faith, love and Christian principals.Becoming Me (Diary of a Teenage Girl: Caitlin, Book 1)is a wonderful book and I encourage you to read this. Share it as a gift this holiday season!Many thanks to Glass Roads Public Relations for sending me this book to review.'"
4,Great Start to an Awesome Series!!!,"The book may start off boring, (and with way too many parentheses) but when you keep reading you get hooked. Its a catching story for teens that deserves an encore (and it has one!)."
4,Becoming Me,Great teenage stories that draw students to want to read the book. I can't keep the series of books in my classroom. As soon as it's checked in it's checked out by someone else.
5,A Great Read,"'Becoming Me' is a sweet novel that deals with many of the issues that face today's teenage girl.At first I wasn't sure how much I would enjoy reading a novel written entirely as a diary, but I was pleasantly surprised! In some ways this style of writing is almost more enjoyable to read, because you don't have to wait very long to know what happens next. Also, the story seems to fly by!I think that 'Becoming Me' is a novel that every teenage girl would enjoy. I highly recommend it!*** I received a complimentary copy of this book from Glass Roads to review. I was asked to give my honest opinion of the book - which I have done. ***"
1,Not what I expected,"I just received these bowls to add to my collection. I'm very disappointed! The color is off, there are chips in each of the bowls AND they are made in Malaysia! I love my Blue Italian Collection, however I will be very careful what I order in the future."
3,"Satisfactory, but nothing earth-shattering","This was an alright book. I found its best use was as a source for additional math problems. If you're trying to really nail the GMAT, this is a good book in that you will encounter a variety of different math questions. You gain some experience, and that is good. But on the other hand, I feel like Kaplan did a bit of a lazy job putting this book together. First off, 99% of the questions are incredibly easy. Secondly, I found several typos and this should just not happen unless the writers are being lazy. Third, it does not do a good job of explaining answers. If this is a thorough review, it should provide at least two ways to solve the more difficult questions - ie plugging in numbers and algebra, not just one. But considering there is only one other book out there, this is the best you can get. Unfortunately, with the exception of the Princeton Review, a lot of those other companies are just plain trash."
3,A GOOD BOOK THAT NEEDS MORE WORK,"It was a good idea to produce a book exclusively for maths, but for people who did not graduate from a technical university, it is difficult to learn maths from one book in just one month! You need the background and the exercise!"
3,"Not bad, but...","in many ways it's interchangeable with alot of other books on the topic of assertiveness out there. It's worth reading, certainly, I just wouldn't pay full price for it. The DESC model, and the quiz at the beginning to help the reader determine how assertive s/he currently is are great. The material on self esteem and stress were boring to me; I'd seen it before with other sources. Chapters 4 and 5 were the best; they got into the exercises/activities and the DESC model. The remaining chapters weren't as strong. The book started to drag at that point. That said, I do like that the author gave the reader alot of opportunity for practice; the exercises themselves are good. I just wish that there'd been more actual content and information. She could've done a supplemental workbook to include all the extra exercises."
3,Asserting Yourself,"This was not the type of book that I thought it would be. It would be fine for a class, but that wasn't what I wanted. But it was set in timely fashion. Mary Curtis"
3,A very funny and romantic movie!!!,"I am in love with Ana Claudia Talancon. And, she's great in this picture. Probably, this movie is one of her best that I have ever seen. She is charming, funny, witty, and has good chemistry with her co-star."
4,Good movie,"I think that this a well done movie. Some profanity and other things that, if your a parent, you might not want your children to see. I like the fact that this movie takes place in Mexico City."
2,Disappointed in the quality,"I thought the labeling was going to be stitched on, like a version that I saw at a friend's party. Instead, the labeling is a cheesy iron-on that looks cheap. I hope it lasts any needed washings without separating."
2,"great looking, but doesn't hold up","I bought this watch for my daughter for Christmas, and now, after just one month of ownership, the ""mickey"" image on the face of the watch has detached and is spinning freely around the center post that the watch hands are mounted on. Granted, she's 8 years old and can sometimes be rough with things, but she really liked this watch and took very good care of it from what I could see (it was always placed safely in it's storage container when not in use). My first impression was that it was very nice looking, seemed to be pretty sturdily built. Seemed like a great deal for $20. But now, a month later, it's ""broken"" and I've got a daughter who's not all that happy, as she doesn't understand how it could be broken, as she went thru considerable measures to take good care of her first real watch."
2,Not so great,"I didn't find that this book met my expectations. I've read better and don't understand all the hoopla about it... On the other hand my father loved it and is buying copies for his friends. So there you go, a mixed review. I still think the Flaming Turkey is the be all end all of turkey hunting stories.This doesn't compare in my opinion."
5,Tom Kellys Best,"This is Tom Kellys best book. It is humorous and any turkey hunter will appreciate it. Tom Kelly mixes humor with his observations of people and the wild turkey in a way no one else can.I read this book in my turkey blind last season waiting for wild turkeys to show up. I laughed out loud a few times!This is a great book for any turkey hunter. Tom Kellys books are all good, but this one is great.Both an experienced hunter and novice hunter will learn a lot about the wild turkey and the characters who chase them."
5,A must read . . .,"A wise old turkey hunter told me about this book in 1988, and I had misplaced that piece of paper until just recently. My mistake. Anyone who hunts turkeys or is associated with people who hunt turkekys will enjoy this book. The author has a way with his words and examples that will make you want to read the book from cover-to-cover without setting it down. It is a must read for both the turkey hunter and non-hunter."
1,Ink Everywhere,"Received in the mail, the packages were leaking ink everywhere. The picture shows a black and color cartridge, so that's what I thought I was getting. Only now do I see that item is for 2 black cartridges, both leaking black ink everywhere. I can't even check to see if the cartridge works, since HP won't work with one empty cartridge."
5,Two for the price of one!!!,A wonderful deal. I am very pleased indeed. Arrived promptly. I wil definitely use again when I need cartridges for either printer.
3,"Do not trust the description, trust the item title","The description reads ""(image shown is exactly what you will receive)"". NOT TRUE.The image shows one black and one color inkjet cartridge. You will receive TWO BLACK inkjet cartridges.I haven't used the cartridges yet, but was surprised to find 2 black instead of one of each. Just thought you should know..."
2,Half good,"The first of the two cartridges I loaded resulted in smudgy, smeared print. I had to simply discard it. The second cartridge works great so far."
3,The only one I could find,"This was the only poster I could find for this great movie.. The problem I have is that the quality isn't the best. It seems somewhat pixelated.. as if someone tried to blow up a much smaller picture. It will work great for the my purposes, but for someone looking for the best quality, good luck finding another."
5,Greatest book I've ever read,"Master Ihor' book is full of fine details as well as deep insights. If you are studying martial arts, this book will be a great help for you."
5,Best kept secret in Uechi-Ryu,"This book is easy to read, and the pictures are so easy to follow. I like to bring my book to class with me to use as a guide when I'm doing kyu kumite. I enjoyed the pen self defense section, and found the legal section to be very informative. Every student should own one. I highly recommend it."
5,Highly Recommended,Master Ihor's book is quite comprehensive. It provides both a history of the style and detailed instructions on how to perform it. The photographs are done well and are helpful.
4,Awesome Book,"This book is AWESOME and this was my second order. I purchased the book twice I showed my SENSEI the book to ensure that it was a good book to use as a reference and he loved it. What I as a new practitioner of the art of Uechi-Ryu Karate enjoyed the most was the simplicity in which Master Rymaruk teaches and displays each technique. I as the beginner can follow with ease. I also have the DVD for the videos he offers which are a good addition to the text. My SENSEI is very good at teaching his students and this text serves as a good reference when I'm not able to see him or make class. Overall, this text is well worth purchasing."
4,"body worlds , real human bodies","we wanted to go to the human exhibit but it hasn;t come close to where we live, so I got the dvd and its wonderful , it informative and interesting.. I felt as tho i was there. Would highly recommend this to anyone.."
4,nice boots,I bought these from the UK for a friend in the US. They arrived very promptly and she liked them. I have yet to see a photo of her in them
2,A big disappointment,"I love Alanis and have every album she's ever made. When I received this DVD/CD combo as a gift I was so excited because I'd never seen her perform live before. But my excitement soon disappeared as I watched the DVD. Talk about unprofessional editing! In the same song they hop from concert to concert, so you don't get a consistant performance. To make matters worse, the sound quality is so bad during some of the concert shots that you can barely hear Alanis, much less the music. Certain points are muted and distorted.I am really upset that Alanis allowed this type of ""quality"" to be put out for her fans. I would expect better from a multiplatinum artist. If she didn't know about it, she should take a listen for herself. So if you're not picky about sound and bad editing, you'll enjoy this. Otherwise don't waste your monet."
2,for an artist so devoted to her work!,"first let me assure you while i don't have a built-in love for everything alanis i consider myself a devoted fan. i was shocked, i must say, to see what alanis seems to be content with being sold to her fans, being an artist devoted one hundert percent to her work. the sound in some of the live tracks is literally unbearable. the skits inbetween the songs (and, unfortunately, sometimes even mid-song) are definitely not everyone's cup of tea, sometimes deeply personal, sometimes nothing short of downright silly. i'd have preferred a no-nonsense live recording with silly bonus scraps within the extra materials. as it is, feast on scraps will leave lots of alanis' fans short of what i'm sure we all expected from this."
2,Unbelievable bad sound...Alanis was great,"I couldn't believe it...in the middle of songs, the sound drops down from 5.1 to distortion and pure [crud] level....and the sound level between most of the music and the interviews/""playing around"" drops between the volumn level of a gun shot to a whisper in the wind.What is the problem here?All I intended to buy was a concert video by a great artist."
1,Rip Off,What a let down this DVD is. The sound quality is BAD. Songs arecontinually being interupted by her egotistic antics. I purchased her first DVD and returned it to the shop in total disgust. When I saw that she had released another I assumed that lessons would have been learned but sadly not. I will not be shelling out any more of my cash on this kind of self indulgence.
3,DISAPPOINTMENT,"I'm a big Alanis fan, and i love the footage and the CD.However, the thing is that the show is not a complete show, and it contains footage of home camera of the show, while Alanis sings a song, the sound moves from Camera to camera, and it's very nice once or twice, but when you want to hear the song completely, you just can't !She did it once in her first DVD, but then she gave in her last DVD (live in navajo nation) a way to watch and hear only the tracks, which was wonderful ! i don't understand, why does she go back? why didn't she gives a way to see only the concert, and to enjoy a pure Alanis show without disturbance???"
3,It could have been Five Stars....,"I was excited about the packaging - unreleased songs and a live concert on DVD, too! - but like everyone else I was disappointed by the sound. I'm not sure why jumping through the different performances during one song had to affect the sound quality? With today's technology I would think this could have been overcome. Despite this, if your an Alanis fan this is a must have! There are plenty of songs where the sound quality is good. I also enjoyed the abundance of backstage scenes/antics and interviews."
2,"Funny, but Needs to Be Seen to Be Appreciated","I was lured into buying this album because of how quirky and strangely disturbing the video for ""Mountain Trip..."" was. A ""family"" singing a vaudevillian-style ditty about public executions in post-WWII Japan is certainly unique and funny, but hearing it on CD just doesn't do it justice. That's pretty much the problem with the rest of the album.Despite the ""stories"" within each song being very humorous, the whole package just doesn't work because we're only getting half of the presentation. It's not as much the music as it is the experience and an experience this odd deserves more than a CD job. A DVD companion is a must for this goofy concept album."
5,Letters from Camp Review,I think that this book was very well written and illustrated. The characters were very interesting to read about. My favorite was Barby Q.. I loved the way the kids found a way to solve the mystery and how in the end they made their own camp. It was a kind of camp that I would like to stay at for the Summer. Please keep writing.
5,READ THIS BOOK!!,"Letters From Camp is about 6 ""siblings"", the Harmony Family singers that started a camp for brothers and sisters that argue a lot to come and learn to be harmonious. It turns out that the Harmonys are actually plotting murder and poison! The kids work to find out the Harmonys amazing past and frightening future.The book has plenty twists and turns and many different kinds of people- 2 kids from London and 2 from a ranch in Texas. The Harmonys are amazing- they appear so nice and happy why they are all really awful. Plus- are they all really siblings?This book has tons of suspense and has a wonderful plot. It was written in the form of letters from the siblings to each other. I loved it! I would definetly buy it-Any kid would love this wonderful mystery."
4,"Bizarre, But Not Lacking in COOLNESS","Okay, this book, Letters From Camp, is about 3 sets of siblings who are sent off by their parents to the loony-bin Camp Happy Harmony in efforts to get along better. In this book, using letters, bills, and other various documents, the kids slowly befriend one-another, and intelligently uncover what's REALLY going on underneath the to-good-to-be-true exterior of wacko Camp Happy Harmony. There's: Mimi Gems - The Artist, Ivan Gems - The Detective/Lover of Fine Literature, Barbie Q. Roast - The Fashion Expert, Brisket Roast - The Master Chef, Charlie Lee - The Music Fancier, and Charlotte Lee - The Dance ProEnjoy this nutty and friend-tastic book!!!"
4,Durable and easy to use,"I have had this stroller for three years now and am still very happy with it. My children (2 and 5) can both sleep comfortably in the reclined postition and it is small enough to fit in place of a chair at a restaurant table. I don't have any problems steering it and I love how easy it is to open and close. The cup holder is not the best design--does tend to slant and spill--and the shade is less than adequate, but since there is not a frayed seam or broken part after three years of very hard use, I have to give it high marks."
2,Lightweight indeed!,"I have become more and more frustrated with my Aria stroller in the past year and a half that I have used it. Like others have said, it steers poorly and is impossible to push with one hand. Bumps are tough on it and so are curbs and tight turns. The cup holder has broken for the second time in one year. The screws come out of the cup holder, the cheap plastic has cracked now it no longer stays in the up position - rather useless indeed. Also, the small plastic piece that is at the end of the recline adjustment straps also fell off and the sun shade barely covers my child's face in the bright sun. But I did purchase it for its lightweightedness and therein lies its only redeeming quality. Too bad, because not only was it expensive, but I purchased it on the Peg reputation."
4,Great Stroller!,"I read all the reviews and then still bought this stroller. I dont understand why people are having problems. It took about 60 seconds to put together out of the box. When I first tried to move it. The wheels stuck and it wouldnt turn - Then I noticed each wheel has a wheel lock, once I unlocked the wheels (flick of a switch). The stroller was extremely easy to push and maneuver - even with one hand. The basket is able to hold my similac diaper bag, purse and a small shopping bag. The recline is easy to move up and down to whatever level you like. The table and cup holder are an added bonus. The best part of course is that it is so light weight. We got the Rose which is beautiful and the Rubino was also very attractive at the store. Great for the price - we paid $119."
2,Read customers' reviews first!!,"Believe in reviews!! I read about customers' reviews after buying this stroller. I thought about return it because most of the reviews were not so good. I regret I did not upgrade to another one. I hate it! First of all, it's hard to lock the car seat in place. This drives me crazy. Second, it is alright when you go straight. But when you make turns, it just doesn't turn the way you want, especially in small passege way in restaurants or stores. The only advantage is it is light weighted."
1,so f***ing boring!!!!,trying WAY too hard to be like reno 911.. this show isn't funny AT ALL..no issues with playno issues with purchaseno issues at all!
1,Just Can't Watch These,I don't know why I purchased this show. Now I'm on Amazon's site trying to figure out how to cancel it. Cruel and Mean show.
1,Useless Product -- does not work,We have tried all the instructions from the book/manual but this product does not work at all with any of garage or community gate. Please do not buy.... There are some better remote control those are easy to use. This one sucks.
3,Stopped working for a bit,Worked perfectly for a week...then started working half the time...then only part of the time. I was going crazy until I opened up the case and saw that the metal battery holders were a bit loose. Clamped them down and it's working fine again. Something to look out for!
5,A wonderful book,"Bassui is any amazing writer/teacher, and his teachings are very accessible. This book used to be hard to find, so I was happy to see it on Amazon."
3,A Decent Read!,"This book is your typical true crime fare. Gina Spann wants her husband out of the way so she can collect his life insurance. She gets young impressionable men to do the crime for her. Although it's an interesting story, it's not one of my personal favorites by this author but it's worth reading anyway."
3,worth reading,"I found this book to be fairly interesting. Once again it is all about greed and money. I feel the writer could have gone into a little more depth, but all in all a good read."
1,Buyer Beware! Missing Track!,The last track of the requiem is missing! The Agnus Dei is not on the CD or the mp3. It is replaced by a duplication of the last track (Op. 121: No. 4. Wenn ich mit Menschen und Engelszungen) on the 2nd CD. (It's also wrong on Itunes.)
5,a lovely book for tangram's lovers,"This book have 334 pages and it is very complete.The introduction is very instructive.There are 11 parts: Letters and numbers, Animals (tangram zoo, cats, dogs, birds, horses, bats, sea creatures...) Mankind (servants, Sam Loyd's portrait gallery, horsemen, medieval ladies...), around the house (watering can, baby carriages, stocking, pistol..), boat and bridges, stories and pictures (the house that jack built, the story of cinderella, a game of billard, the orchestra), a little mathematics (! ), chinoiseries (some chinese characters, dagger, raincot, ""drinkink alone""), paradoxes and illusions, double tangrams (rocket, coach, sport car, television set, lion..) et the fifteen-piece puzzle (a pavillon in the moolight, a man asleep in a drifting boat..).The solutions are given in the back of the book. The illustrations and the explanations are very clear. The author wrote a book really complete about tangram"
3,Very disappointed the book is not full size,I was very disappointed that the book was not full size. I wanted the child to be able to place the tangrams on the page itself. Now I will have to try to enlarge the page somehow to make it fit tangrams on it properly I guess. The figures seem to be very good and the solutions in the back are helpful. So if you wanted your child to just look at the figures and replicate them to the side somehow the book would be fine.
3,misaligned tanagram pictures,"This book has a lot of good shapes, but the details of many of the tanagrams are washed out or misaligned, so it's difficult to verify that you've made the right shape. I had a tanagram last night that had a big bump near a corner, but the picture of the tanagram didn't have the bump--when I checked the back of the book to find out how to really do it, I had done it correctly, but their shapes were a little off!"
5,Tout sur le tangram!,"Ce livre de 334 pages est vraiment complet. Il a une introduction très instructive. Il est divisé en onze parties: Letters and numbers, Animals (tangram zoo, cats, dogs, birds, horses, bats, sea creatures...) Mankind (shoeshine boy and customer, acrobats, medieval ladies...), around the house (pipe, shoes, chairs, pistol..), boat and bridges, stories and pictures (the house that jack built, the story of cinderella, a game of billard, the orchestra), a little mathematics (! ), chinoiseries (some chinese characters, ""Buddha hand""...), paradoxes and illusions, double tangrams (house, cyclist, sport car, telescope, microscope..) et the fifteen-piece puzzle (a pavillon in the moolight, a man asleep in a drifting boat..). Les solutions sont données à la fin du livre. Les illustrations et les explications sont très claires. L'auteur a écrit un livre vraiment complet sur les tangrams."
5,History of Kenshaw's Bridade,I was surprised how the fast the book arrived. Have already read and enjoyed it. Will enjoy it for years to come using it as a reference book. Thank you for this book
2,An unreconstructed rebel's story,"You do get a story of all the fighting that this brigade from South Carolina was involved during the Civil War. However, the author is an unreconstructed rebel and the style is so over-the-top to make the Southern cause so sacred and the Yankees so vile, that it loses credibility. It is a good source for dates and what was taking place, but you have to get through all the fluff."
5,a good old boy telling his side.,"This is certainly the old time Southern view, as it should be, written by a soldier of this troop known as one of the best in the entire Rebel Army. He expresses his ideals about the politics, the history, and also about the battles. His tales about the men are interesting and entertaining, like listening to one's granddaddy telling of his life long ago. I, being a modern scholar and a midwesterner, as well as an ardent scholar of the Civil War, have read many books by scholars, and only a few by the actual participants in the war. This is a really fine frankly honest book written by a devoted Secessonist and soldier of the south. It is well worth the price to have this old man sitting at my elbow reciting his version of the war, with the ""Bloody Seventh"", one of the bravest and best of the battalions and brigades fighting in Northern Virginia under Lee. An excellent historical book, helping one to understand another point of view."
2,You get what you pay for....,"It works the way it's supposed to, but I have used it about 5 times with my MacBook Pro, recording music, and it's already starting to break on me. I have had to sometimes hold it into the mic input while recording, just to make sure that it doesn't cut in and out on me. Also, although it still works, the 3.5 mm male end has begun to be able to spin around. The sound quality is good, but I wouldn't buy this piece again. I guess the lesson here is: You get what you pay for."
4,marshmallow blower,"Very sturdy, durable, and easy to clean. Great way for boys to have fun and no one gets hurt."
5,Hit of the Holiday,I purchased the Marshmallow Blower as a last minute gift for my teenagers and it turned out to be the biggest hit of the holiday at our home. Not only did the under 18 crowd have a blast the adults couldn't help but want to be part of the fun too! Overall this product was very easy to use. I would have liked to have seen instructions sent with the product or at least printed on the packaging. It took a few minutes to figure out how to load the marshmallows but once figured out made for non stop fun!!
3,Marshmallow blower,"This is a fun product for kids. It makes them have to work a little bit, but they have fun with it!"
1,Not good. . .dont waste money,"Doesnt work. Worst purchase I ever made on amazon. Very small marshmellows, and they dont shoot far. They sometimes dont even shoot. I was disapoointed."
4,tons of fun,The kids have tons of fun with these. We like the safety blow tube; we're not worried about them accidentally inhaling a mini marshmallow.
1,"Amazon continuing to send ""Made in China""","When I got the cup & saucers they were Made in China and NOT in England as the Amazon site states. The same problem was noted last year but there has been no change from Amazon's side.I sent a complaint and they promptly dispatched another ""Made in China"" set. Totally ridiculous.Both sets are being returned.Wish it was possible to give negative stars for all the aggravation and disappointment."
3,spode Teacup and saucer,I ordered 2 Spode Teacups and Saucers when I ordered a Spode Teapot. I was disappointed to find that the cups and saucers were made in China while the Teapot was made in England. Had I known that the cups and saucers were made in China I would not have purchased either Spode product. I believe country of origin should be noted.
3,Made in China!,"Buyers beware! The set of 12 tea cups and saucers I have bought in October, was made in England, as was stated in the product description. A couple of additional tea cups/saucers I have bought in November, 2007 were made in China. Even though the quality of the ones made in China is not bad, these cups/saucers do no exactly match the ones made in England in shape and size. I have complained to Amazon and they promised to change the description to reflect the right place of product origin."
5,A TOUCHING PICTURE OF LIFE IN THE SEA,"Opening with a midnight scene lit by a piercing lighthouse beam readers see a large turtle laboriously pulling herself onto the beach in order to dig in the sand and lay her eggs. As the light illuminates her shell we see scars and marks, maps of the battles she has fought to survive.Once, when she was very young, a shark had surprised her, nipping at her from beneath. Another time as she grazed for jellyfish, which she loved, she was plowed under the surface by a large boat.Life is not easy for denizens of the sea, whether the danger is found in a sudden storm or a hidden net. Nonetheless, this mother turtle persevered to lay her eggs.Mr. Arnosky has painted a touching picture of life in the sea, and of the new life that is born there...."
2,B.S.,I ordered this book and it never showed up. Never buy anything from this book store if you actually want to get your purchase.
3,It's Okay,"I think this book had potential to be better. I really like the stories he had on the road. I also like his attitude towards working out. I would have much rather him either done purely a workout book, or his life story. It just feels incomplete. As far as the info, good info, just wish there was more."
4,Triple H is THE GAME,"This book is a rather good read, even though it does leave a lot out. Triple H is one of my all time favorites, only being outshown by Undertaker. I wish that this book would have went more in-depth into his life, his relationship with Chyna, his friendships,etc. But Triple H is not overweight like some reviewers have said. Did you see the pictures in the book? The man is rock solid. Give him a break, he's busy with expecting a child. Obviously some people haven't went through a pregnancy with their wives."
4,A Brief Book On The Game,"Fans of HHH will definitely enjoy this one as I did. But as a newcomer to the gym world, I found this book to be too brief. Brief in terms of fitness advice and tips, and also on his life. It would be so great if this book had 60-70% more to it. Perhaps a biography some time in the future? Although the book is brief and all, it's still a very good read, albeit short."
1,Triple H's approach is the pharmacy.,"I have no clue why this book was even considered. Triple H is a professional wrestler in the WWE, he is also the husband to Vince McMahon's daughter. These days it seems like WWE wrestlers come out with a new book about their miserable life, or for this matter teaching us all how to stay in shape.According to Triple H, I believe his approach to fitness is probably the same way Barry Bonds stays fit, or Jason Giambi stays in fit. Steriods, in case you don't know what I'm talking about.I remember watching Triple H having a small body, and then BOOM he gets big. Wonder why? Ask Hulk Hogan, or Scott Steiner, they both may tell you how Triple REALLY got his physique.I hiss at this book, it's like buying hair products from Cher, even though she's wearing a wig. It's fake and a shame that people are actually buying this thinking they are getting good advice from a guy whose job is to act out a part. Give me a break."
1,Steroid made,"The truth is the book is a lie because it asks the reader to believe that HHH built his body by using the regiment in the book which is false. He built it with a combination of whats in the book, and a massive steroid intake.Its true steroids do not make you instantly large, you have to bust @ss in the gym also, but reading this book will make people falsely believe they can be built like HHH if they follow his principles. Its simply a lie.Now if in the book he had said, ""hey I took roids and busted my hump to look like this"". THen I would respect him more."
1,"Wrestling is FAKE, Triple H is FAKE, this book is FAKE.","I used to be a huge wrestling fan back in the 80's. Of course I was a kid back then, so I was a little naive. But today's wrestling has went from pure wrestling to writing books? Ever since FatBoy Mick Foley wrote his book about his stupid life, it seems that every wrestler writes a book. Rock, Hogan, Flair, Heenen, and even Jerry Lawler. Who the hell cares about Jerry The King's life anyway? A [...] who collects Coke products? Wow, let's stick in a hundred pages on that.Now Triple H has written a book. Not just any book. A book about how to be The Game. I don't want to be the game. I don't want to be some fat, long haired, fake wrestler that puts on his black underwear and rolls around with other sweaty half naked men."
1,"photoreading is an advanced concept, but not here...","Photoreading is quite an advanced concept of the future of reading. There is no doubt that it can happen, but it takes much more than a book stating how amazing the idea is to actually happen. This book does not provide any real instruction on photoreading. It just hypes up the concept. Perhaps it may inspire an inventor to come up with a way in which to implement a real photoreading strategy/ tactic in educational methods...?"
1,don't buy this book unless you have money to burn,Sorry but you can't read a book by flipping pages one a second and believe that your going to get anything out of it. I believe that there may be some subconcious processing going on but that doesn't help your concious understanding.The later stages of the technique were sensible but most of the techniques I already use. Do yourself a favour and save your money!
1,Cognitive Science,"You are reading this. The letters are about ~18"" away from you. The photoreptors on the back of your eye (rods and cones) have a specific density (closeness together). Imagine a whole bunch of circles inside one another (like a target). The closer to the center the more dense. In other words you can't read out of the corner of your eyes because it is your peripheral vision. The density of the rods and cones is not dense enough to be able to read anything more than about ~3"" inches away from the focal point of what you are reading (20/20 vision, font size=12, distance from source ~18""). It can't hit your subconscience because your senses can't even ascertain the detail needed to capture the details. Find legitimate scientific (empirical) studies and prove me wrong."
1,I haven't read the book,"But I think I photoread all the comments. The book sucks or it's the best thing in the world. The only time my subconcious works is when the information is in my head and then it works it out in my sleep or some other time. How do you get the information by unfocusing your attention on the book as you flip through the pages? All that comes to my head would be a few words that are easily forgotten 5 page flips later. You guys confirmed it cause I thought there was something deeper than flipping the pages that I didn't know about, and so to find that out I would have had to buy the book. But now I know that all it is is flipping pages every few seconds."
1,Waste of time and money,"Reading at 25,000 WPM is attractive. ""Mentally photographing"" a book within three minutes is attractive. There are heaps of books and journals and material out there to be read. Who wouldn't want to look at a page for less than a second and remember everything on it? That would be unreal.And it _is_ unreal.I tried it - the tangerine on my head, ""photographing"" etc. No increase in reading speed or improvement in comprehension and recall. The book did not benefit me in any way. In fact, it wasted a lot of my time.Don't waste your time and money on this."
4,Great Alternative,"Good book. Written earnestly. Great alternative to purchasing a $200 or $500 program. I can't vouch for the program results, but the skills in this book require practice. Its not an overnight thing. But i can say that after using this book from the onset, my memory improved & my mind was driven to be tested all before i gained the ability to photoread. Book is good. My development is still in progress."
5,GREAT BOOK!,"PhotoReading really does work. Although Paul Scheele advertises his other products often in the book, this is a great book nonetheless. I recommend buying it if you want to improve your mind and your reading speed A LOT."
1,"Y'All Are Kidding, Right?","This book is one of the biggest absurdities I have ever laid eyes on. It promises to teach you to read 25,000 words a minute. But guess what. It doesn't. You don't READ 25,000 wpm, you SKIM (at best). PhotoReading itself entails nothing more than looking at the pages with unfocused vision. That's it. The rest of the ""Whole Mind System"" is a patchwork of other people's accelerated learning techniques. There is also a great deal of self-advertisement.There is absolutely nothing in this book that is unique and useful. You'd be much better served buying a good book on speed reading.I used the techniques in this book for about 4 months in my college work, regularly and conscientiously. I can say it's hogwash. Absolutely asinine mumbo-jumbo. Do yourself a favor. Skip this book."
5,I'm not being paid to write this but IT WORKS!,"Have you noticed that people reviewing this book either loved it or hated it? Well, if you have an open mind, this will work. It's a great way to take apart a book (great for technical stuff) and go after the info that you need.This is not for ripping through a trashy novel on a beach, which you would want to take your time and get absorbed!I'm a computer programmer and have absorbed the info that I need from a programming book in less time than ever before.The people that are ripping on this book are closed minded and this will prevent them from getting results.I'd go to the library and check it out and please go at it with an open mind. It will change the way you read!"
3,mixed reviews,"the most valuable part of this book, in my opinion, is the previewing & reading without sub vocalization. I don't give much credence to the reading 25,000 words per minute, although the subconscious is very powerful, there maybe something to it. This book is worth reading but don't waste your $$ on the $250 + course; this is all you need. I'd give it 4 or 5 stars if the author didn't exaggerate. I think that he makes it sound better than it is. It's definitely worth $12, especially if you're an avid reader or student."
5,READ THIS BOOK WITH AN OPEN MIND!!,"Read with an open mind and you will get results!!!! The reader from England obviously didn't read the entire book since the idea is not actually 'read'. All I can say is that this book accelerates learning to such a high degree. I myself didn't get much results in the beginning, hardly if any. But time and practice is all it takes. It's like learning to drive, you don't master driving skills in one sitting, you have to practice enough times before you can get results. And this book does just that; it teaches a faster (more convenient) way of 'reading', I would consider it cheating since I am a high school student. I get essays and books done within an hour which used to take me few days!!!!! Get it if you want to 'honestly cheat'!!!"
5,Yeah... it really works.,"Prior to reading Photoreading, I was averaging a book every 10 days. I now can read a 300 page book in 60 to 90 minutes with better comprehension and retention. I totally understand why anybody would be skeptical about these claims,(they're amazing to me) but they're absolutely true. The only downside to this book is that I'm buying a LOT more books at Amazon.com. But man... I'm learning a lot."
1,A Sham,"Huh. I thought I was perhaps the only person who had ever read this book...Guess not.I tried PhotoReading for an entire semester of graduate work, and I can assure you, that for serious students, it simply doesn't cut the mustard. This is not reading. It's browsing, skimming. But it isn't reading.The author seems to think that only about 10% of everything we read is of substance, and that PhotoReading will help us pull that 10% out of its environment of useless dross. It simply isn't so. The previewing and review techniques may be useful, but these are very standard critical reading skills, and have nothing to do specifically with the ""PhotoReading"" portion of the ""Whole Mind System.""This book is a shameful act of self-promotion, in my opinion. There is no substitute for hard work."
4,A good book,"I found this book useful is several ways. First, it gives a thourough overview of some of the more conventional reading comprehension enhancement techniques. Many of these techniques will help reading comprehension, regardless of whether or not you apply photoreading. It is no big surprise to see that they are incorporated into the Photoreading system.Second, I have found the photoreading aspect of this book is based on truth. My experience with photoreading so far is that my mind IS capable of grasping concepts, even from a photoread. I have reserverations about what the author claims actually causes the phenonmena; however, until science advances more in the area, this seems to be the only book that offers anything about it.Even if you don't adhere to the photoread philosophy, the other techniques in the book should improve your reading. The book is definitely worth reading."
4,Hard work,"Photoreading can work, if you practice hard enough at it and really work hard. The materials in this package were top notch in quality and presentation. All that's left is to apply some top notch sweat and effort to learning the method."
1,Crap,"This book and all the others that claim you can have a super memory or read zillion words per minute are absoulute crap, and if you buy into this, you're obviously a sucker for anything (I without a doubt was and may sound like a hypocrite). I suggest going to the library instead, and borrowing every type of book similar to this and trying it out. Then you'll know not to waste your hard earned $"
1,Total wrong,"Do yourself a favor - do not get this. It is very wrong. You will not learn to read 30,000 words a minute - or even increase your speed. This course teaches how to read by not really reading. With a little meditation and some pop-PSYCHOLOGY - they hope to keep you trying and make you think the problem is with you. News flash: this course DOES NOT work! Pediod."
1,A waist of ink and money,"After ready the Photoreading Whole Mind System, I practiced the principles taught for a number of months. At first, I had high hopes for this seemingly promising system. Yet, as time progressed, I began to lose all faith and hope that this system would ever work. For all of its outrageous claims, it falls far short of the mark."
5,This book is a must for students.,"Initially, I was extremely skeptical. I practiced with the book for one week and noticed some results. Now, a mere four weeks after I purchased the book, my reading speed exceeds 1000wpm for law school texts (compared to the embarrassing, sub-vocalized 200wmp speed from which I began) and approximately 2000wmp for casual reading (with much stronger long-term retention capabilities and comprehension)! With more practice, I am certain to achieve a faster reading speed with even greater comprehension). Remember, ""photo-reading"" is a skill and thus takes time, patience, practice and, most importantly, RELAXATION. For me, I realized more than a five-fold increase in 4 weeks with 3-6 hours per day of practice and I'm not done yet...."
5,Give It Time It Will Work,"I saw this advertised on a late night commercial. I thought for $17 I would give it a try. I have to say that it really works. It took me a couple of week to get the system down, but I can now read a book in 30 minutes. As I read more and more books I can tell that I'm getting faster and faster. If you stick with the program, and give yourself time, you will be successful at PhotoReading."
1,I'd give it a 0 stars if I could,"I really, really wanted photoreading to work. Unfortunately, it doesn't. I read the book, tried the techniques, and could get anywhere. I then bought the Paul Scheele's Photoreading Personal Learning Course. As I said, I really, really wanted this to work. The photoreading part is pure fantasy. ""Effortlessly photoread the book, let your unconscious mind process it, and then 'activate' the material to bring only the important information to your conscious mind."" Yeah, right. Sorry folks, it just doesn't work that way. You have to read the old fashioned way to get any comprehension. I agree with another reviewer: if it worked like advertised, a reputable news source would have picked up the story by now."
1,What a crock,"Its basically skimming. You can use this on magazines or newspapers, people do this anyways. Just because you can flip through a magazine in 5 or 10 mins doesn't mean you can read 25,000 wpm. If you think you're going to learn complex or detailed material or any academic material its bogus. This is a hoax, if it works you sure as hell won't learn to do it with this book anyway. If this actually worked I imagine the educators would jump all over this. The only one I see hyping this is Scheele."
1,Simply Terrible (and Deceptive)...,"Somehow this book expects you to distort your vision and flip through the pages of a book really fast and you'll magically absorb 90% of the material. Right...I can assure you that even the author of this book probably doesn't believe his outrageous lies. He even states clearly at one point that ""you won't achieve conscious awareness of material that you photoread"" until you somehow place yourself in a position where you need to recall the information! That's a great way to get yourself fired! For those of you out there that value your academic and professional career so little that you really want to photoread those textbooks and reports and hope and pray that you ""absorbed"" the material properly, this is the book and the techniques for you. For the rest of us, try buying a book on time management to clear more time in your day to read what you need to rather than rely on some silly photoreading technique that likely won't be very effective."
2,Poppycock,"I try to keep an open mind, but I found the strategies that Scheele outlines are, at best, hit-or-miss. In other words, I don't believe it's impossible to subconsciously absorb some of the material that you photoread, but it's unlikely that you will be able to retrieve it to the extent that you desire. I did find some value, however, in the idea of purposeful reading, although I am still highly dubious of any speed-reading strategy."
1,bad book,this book is not satisfying book . the author says to read ( photoread )in 1 second 2 pages or 25000 words per minutethen use some old speed reading methods to understand the material .in other words he just wanna encourage you to read fast by telling you that if you just look at the pages differently your subconscious will understand the the pages . of course you will not understand anything unless you will read again (normal reading )in summary if u wanna just what is in the book . it is just telling you how to see the pages differntly and using old speed reading methodsi advise you strongly to read speed reading and mind mapping by tony buzan . even if you think that photoreading is working because you will need it after just merely seeing the pages ..
1,Total waste of Time...,"As other reviewers have stated, this book is just a waste of time and money.The book does not describe anything pertaining to photoreading. The steps and suggestions mentioned in this book could be summarized as relax, preview, relax, and finally stare at the pages. I wished the book would have covered any steps to speed read, if anything the book describes skimming and does not do a good job at that either.Filled with a hundred or more stories on how photoreading has helped people, I really wished that I would have learned one thing from this book."
