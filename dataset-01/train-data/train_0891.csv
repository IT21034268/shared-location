5,extra snaps for the bonus tracks,"not extra sure about that last review (i really don't know much about kenny g) but this is a really fun cd by these girls. much like in style with their first album - sugar-tart punky-pop tunes with hard power 80's style guitars and pouty yet aggressive girl shouts, all with a little more sheen and tons of style! originally titled ""girl power"" in the uk, this japanese import is very important to hardcore fans as it contains the ORIGINAL version of ""i know what boys like"" and those bonus extended mixes! highly recommended!"
4,Through a glass darkly.,"Echo House has a style that is vaguely reminiscent of FitzGerald and also LeCarre. Just unfolds the story much as the characters operate, in the shadows, behind the scenes. We are denied details that would bring the narrative into focus and have to piece it together. The picture of how power operates in Washington is both fascinating and frightening. All in all, a very good read."
3,Echoes in an empty house,"There's lots of style to this story. Just is deft at creating scenes and then sliding in some major piece of the story almost as an aside. You have to wait until the next chapter to find out how and why the big event happened. I enjoyed the snippets of life in behind-the-scenes Washington. The problem is that they're only snippets. We never find out what really drives these men or how they really feel about anything or anyone. That's a shame because it's almost impossible for the reader not to care about Alex and Alec. As notied in one of the ""professional"" reviews above: the government players come and go but the system is forever. But that fact alone doesn't make for good storytelling. And if you don't live within 50 miles of DC, I can't imagine there would be anything in this book to keep you interested."
5,Haunting and Terrific,Ward Just might be the most underrated American writer at work today. This is his finest work (which says a lot as An Unfinished Season was so spectacular) and traces the lives of a Washington family through three generations. Just does a wonderful job of creating a world on the margins of a bigger one -- the Behls deal with the nation's capital throughout the 20th Century moving from the light into the shadows and back again. It will be hard for any reader to forget the opening pages when the book brims with such hope and the later pages when the power dynamics have changed drastically.
2,Plenty of sublety and nuance - not much of a story,"I only slogged through this snoozer because I had read A Dangerous Friend by Just and thought it was very good. Therefore, surely this book would eventually become interesting to read rather than the chore it proved to be. Not so.I found this to be a book that doesn't do a good job of developing its characters or its story. Even though I'm interested in Washington and its inside baseball, this book just didn't tell enough to be interesting. Everything was vague and cloaked in secrecy and dullness. Not a very good formula for a book in my view. The author is clearly a gifted wordsmith, but he failed me as a ""storysmith"" in this effort. I'd recommend you skip it."
2,disappointed,"This novel appeared on a number of best books of the year lists for 1997. I can't imagine why. The story, following three generations of a Washington family, was mildly intriguing, but the dialogue often was almost unreadable. If you are looking for a good Washington novel to read this summer, save your time on this one and pick something else."
2,Let's talk about 'Mrs. Pfister'.,"What in the world is all the hype for? Just writes like an anglophile from the fifties. The two stars here are for the French village scene and the opening prologue. Now, let's talk about the ridiculous 'psychic'. Since she's never revealed to be a fake, Just wants us to believe she really has supernatural powers? And this is marketed as a realsitic novel of Washington? Hmm..my psychic is telling me that Ward Just will be out of print soon enough. Bottom line: Overwritten, underplotted, unbelievable."
1,Not a AC Delco Part,The box is a AC Delco box egr valve is a after market part like Wells or Durlastyou can buy it at Auto Zone for 20.00 cheaper The egr valve in the picture is not the one you will be sent
3,Good clock for the price,This clock is a little loud as other reviewers have stated but not overly annoying. I was a little disappointed with the appearance of the blueish gray markings on the leaves. In MHO the way the markings are placed on the leaves kind of give a look of poor craftmanship but for the price it's not really surprising.
1,Good quality - way too uncomfortable,"Arrived quickly from shoes.com. The quality of the shoes was good, but the were very uncomfortable. Shoes.com was good about the return. I won't order shoes on line again unless they are a reorder of the same shoe, same size as a pair i've already owned (my mistake)."
4,Good item for a long trip...but...,"It says 400 Watt Inverter but that's only if hooked directly to battery. I assumed this was true when I placed the order, but would have liked more detail in Amazon.The item is nice and compact with 2 electrical receptacles, an on/off switch and two sets of cables to attach to the posts, one for the batter (with clamps like a jumper cable) and one for the cigarette lighter. It's a good size and does exactly what you want, as long as you don't want more than something like 90 watts from the cigarette lighter."
2,Did not Fit,Krups 053 gold tone coffee filter.This unit is as good as all other Krups products it is for the 10 to 12 cup Krups product but does not fit the 10 cup XP 1500 Krups model there is not gold tone filter for that model according to Krups.
1,PAIN IN THE BUTT!,"For the life of me, I can't understand the reason for this type of filter over the paper kind. Rinsing this thing out after each use is a pain in the butt and grounds actually get thru to your coffee. If you're worried about the environment, consider: paper is a renewable resource, and consider the environment of your septic or sewer system when you wash down your coffee grounds - they don't decompose easily, and accumulate over time.PRO:Win - Buy once.CON:Fail - ease of use.Fail - saves the environment.Fail - harmful to septic/sewer (Google it yourself).Fail - grounds get thru to your coffee."
1,Don't get a gold filter for the Krups FMF5 10-cup programamable coffeemaker,"I purchased the gold filter to go with the Krups FMF5 10-cup programamable coffeemaker - since on Amazon, it was something that people purchasing the coffeemaker were also buying. I hadn't had anything but a ""paper filter"" coffeemaker before. Anyhow, this filter does NOT FIT inside the filter holder on the Krups FMF5 10-cup programamable coffeemaker. Paper is the only option for you."
1,BETTER OFF WITH PAPER FILTERS,"Don't buy this product. It was ill-fitting and incompatible with the coffee maker amazon matched it up with. I returned mine and went with paper filters, which work so much better and are cleaner."
2,Tough clean up,"The thing I hate about this is cleaning out the grounds..the easy way is rinsing it out in the sink, however it's no good to have all these going through your garbage disposal. Otherwise it was a great idea."
1,Didn't fit my Krups coffee maker,"I bought this filter since it is supposed to fit most Krups' drip coffee makers. My Krups model is a common, fairly new, model so I thought it should work. It doesn't. It fit poorly and when I started to brew a pot of coffee the filter door popped open and coffee and grounds went all over the place. I will now order another filter with the specific number to fit mine."
1,Cant find in stores,"Item is just as decsribed and perfect. The problem was that I could not find this item in any stores, rendering my $100+ coffee maker useless. Specialty and big box stores all stock items based on expected sales, not necessarily customer needs. After your expensive item is 3-4 years old the demand for parts, such as this filter, goes down and the storers dont bother to stock therm amy longer. They would prefer I simply junk my old item ($100+) and by a new one. Were it not for placers like amazon.com we would have no choice. Online sales help keep brick and mortar stores in check.John Miller"
3,Don't mix it up! It's the 60's Nirvana...,"The first Nirvana existed in the 60's and early 70's. ""Local Aethestic"" is their last album. Nirvana was a minor cult figure famous for their catchy psychedelic pop songs, but in this album (their last album), the only member left(Patrick Campbell-Lyons) produced this truly progressive rock album. The opening of each track are quite impressive, but unfortunately they soon diluted by the inept psychedelic pop remnants of their former glory. Actually not their best, but with merit, and the arrangement is clever and complex, too."
5,"Great fan cooling, keeps things quiet and cool at load","This thing keeps my e8400 at around 50-60C at all times, even gaming. It barely kicks up speed when I'm gaming. It does pick up a bit more with video processing. This fan is capable of quite high speed and will keep your CPU in a safe range without working hard. I wish it could cool even half as well as my water cooling system, but that's fine I don't need to overclock. It also helps to increase the airflow of my system since it stands up and blows air out of the rear.The stock fan that came with my processor would be loud and buzzy when on full load gaming or mass processing. This thing is incredibly quiet in comparison.Installation is so simple. Way easier than a stock fan. This went right in without much force and stays solidly attached.Great fan especially for the price."
5,A very good processor heatsink/fan,"This very quiet, very efficient unit. It is easy to install.A keeper."
2,Thermaltake CL-P0370,"I like the look and capabilities of this product, the plastic part protecting the fan is extremely cheap and fragile though."
1,Just not worth it ...,I agree with several of the problems listed ahead of mine. I was unable to successfully use this product. I have error after error and it shuts down in the middle of a project most of the time. I connected with their 'support' team several times and followed their instructions. I have replaced several components as they had suggested to find that none of it mattered. Just save your money. Don't go with Pinnacle products.
1,Disallusioned,It works on my gateway computer but wont work on my dads brandnew Hp computer . And yes the tech support sucks . :( The whole reason we bought this was to use it on his computer to transfer mini d/v tape to dvd .
1,Missing basic functionality,"The Dazzle DVC 90 comes with Studio 9 Quickstart - a hobbled version of Studio 9. The problem with Quickstart is that it is missing the basic functionality of a video capture program - namely, best quality video and audio. Quickstart does not allow capture from the S-video input and puts non-stereo audio on either the left or right side but not both. By the way, none of the Pinnacle products come with technical support."
1,Plug and Pray,"If you are expecting a fully-functional plug-and-play experience, avoid the Dazzle 90 at all costs. I followed the (completely inadequate) documentation to the letter, but was unable to perform even the simplest capture. Upon exchanging the unit at the retailer and reinstalling the (hobbled) software from scratch - again, nothing. Right now, the Dazzle 90 is a paperweight until I can return it and buy something that actually works. Avoid, avoid, avoid."
3,HOW TO USE THE DAZZLE DCV-90 WITHOUT THE SOFTWARE,I have been able to create and edit my video captures with the Dazzle DCV-90 without the Pinnacle Software. Windows XP is equipped with Windows Movie Maker I was able to download the Driver for the DVC-90 PCLEUSB2 from the Pinnacle website. Played a bit with the Microsoft Movie software and am presently copying the last of the Videocassette stuff that I recorded over DECADES. The software is a hard drive hog needes alot of room to place the files on. BUT IT IS POSSIBLE TO USE THE DEVICE WITHOUT THE PINNACEL SOFTWARE that is supplied with the DAZZLE DVC-90.3 stars because the software kept crashing windows!
1,Don't waste your money,"I'd give this item 0 stars if I could. Item does not work. Software does not install properly on Windows XP. This is even worse than the Plextor AX 100 Video Converter - at least that one just froze in the middle of a VHS transfer -- this one won't even let me start! I returned the item and purchased the Avermedia USB 2.0 DVD EZ Maker, and it works seamlessly!"
1,This software is a nightmare - their Tech support couldn't help,"I bought this software for my brand new, high powered PC from Best Buy without checking for reviews. BIG MISTAKE!It never worked properly. Mostly couldn't get a video feed from either of my camcorders to the preview screen and when it did - it was very garbled. When I tried recording, it dropped hundreds of frames per minute. Their technical support was friendly - indicating my PC's specs were plenty good enough - but couldn't help. They suggested the hardware part of the package was defective and that I exchange it. I did - but still didn't work - even after reinstalling the software.Save yourself major aggrevation and hours of frustration and DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!Now I need to find a product that actually works. Obviously Best Buy doesn't do any research/validation before offering software so I won't be looking there again for a solution."
1,Turkey icon is needed for this product,"It stopped showing signs of life after 5 minutes. It never did work. If you have to use Dazzle, sellect the 120 or 150 capture device."
1,Avoid.,"Oh dear, oh dear. After trying unsucessfully to capture video with the DVC 80, I took it back for a refund and thought I'd try the DVC 90 instead, hoping that it would give better results. But again, all I got was a blank screen and absolutely no video or sound. I tested it on 3(!) different VCRs and 2 different computers (2.0ghz, 2.8ghz, both have 512mb ram) and had no luck whatsoever. Trouble shooting is a joke. Customer suport practically non-existent. I'm going to send this one back to the supplier too. I'm never buying anything by ""Pinacle"" again; perhaps ""Nadir"" would have been a more appropriate name for them. How do these people remain in business ?"
1,Garbage!!!,"I bet I spent 50 to 60 hours fooling around with this product and never could get it to work worth a darn. Uninstalling, reinstalling, and editing the register. Finally I gave up on the hardware and borrowed a different capture device. I figured I could at least use the software. I captured two hours of home movies and then tried to use the studio 9 software. After about 45 mins it would just stop working. No freeze, just decided to stop rendering. I have a high end system and Pinnacle did try to help but the product is just to buggy. It is now on its way to a landfill. If this product was free it would not be worth it. Your time is far to valuable to waste on this garbage."
1,How do I give this ZERO stars?,"Boy! Reading the other reviews, this is sure a LOVE/HATE product! I also could not get this to work after hours and hours of trying. I finally figured out how to get my computer to recognize it but never could get it to capture video. Followed all the website suggestions and even had their online tech support guy try to help and he was stumped as well. I really wanted this to work but never could get it to do anything."
2,Won't Capture with Pinnacle Studio 10,It worked fine with pinnacle studio 9. I upgraded to pinnacle studio 10 and now it captures glitchy and dropes frames. It is on the same machine and I downloaded the driver updates. It bothers me.
4,Gets the job done,For a hobbyist product this iron works very well along with the adjustable temperature stand. Warmup is not incredibly fast but much better than the $12 cheapo irons that just plug into the wall you find at walmart or radio shack. Tips are standard interchangeable weller tips cheaply available at electronics supply houses or well directed google searches. I just bought an assorted 10pk for 6.79 on ebay. Not quite professional quality but definitely above novice entry-level soldering pens.
1,Broke after 1 year of use,Worked fine for about a year and then the heating element burned out. When I took it apart pieces of white rock fell out that I guess was the heat resistant insulator that broke apart :-/
1,Soldering Station Doesn't work!!,I bought the Weller 5 to 40 watt Soldering Station and it got here fast but the iron is bad!! Doesn't heat up!! BOOOooooooo!!!
4,Fun to read!,"Abby Merganser is determined to marry Dr. Seth Hendon. Unfortunately, Seth seems a little . . . shall we say less than enthusiastic to the idea?This a really good story. It starts off with a bang - funny, interesting, lots of authentic, historical detail - which is always a plus for me. The characters are funny, the story is fast-paced and heartwarming.I did not enjoy it, however, and I'll explain why. This story deals - at length - with two people who have long term chronic, and potentially fatal illnesses. Having just lost two close family members after a very long and painful illness, I found this book simply too sad, it brought up so many bad memories, and I found those parts of the book painful to read.So, this is my synopsis - this is a fun, fast-paced book, with a heartwarming ending - however, if this kind of story (long term chronic illness) will bring up bad memories for you, you may want to skip it."
1,horrible,"the car seat is too heavy, its hard to put down the carrier bar. The stroller incline adjustment is rediculous. it takes forever to adjust the straps and its always getting stuck when you collapse it."
1,Very dangerous travel system..DO NOT BUY!!,"I bought this travel system before I looked at the reviews here (stupid me). After reading how some parents experienced the problems with the stroller folding up and having the car seat fly out, I became a little worried. After all, my baby's safety is my #1 priority. I went to Babies R' Us today and I pressed the release latch to fold the stroller while the car seat was still in it. Sure enough, the whole thing collapsed and the car seat flew out HEAD FIRST!! I did this in front of an employee, who was as shocked as I was. She even did it..twice!! Needless to say, I'm returning this stroller first thing tomorrow. I haven't even put it together yet, thank God."
3,"Ug, I really hate this system","Before our baby was born I did a ton of research on baby products. I thought I had done a really good job picking out our travel system. WRONG!First of all the base is nearly impossible to install correctly, I'm still not 100% comfortable with how it is now.The carseat handle is really hard to move back.It is a constant fight to keep the straps untwisted and even (We are always having to adjust the straps because the right strap is super tight and the left is all lose and flapping around) Not to mention how hard it is to keep those 2 clips overlapped to buckle the stinking thing without pinching baby fingers!Now that she is a little older, 6 months, when she falls asleep her little head is always flopped over.The only thing I like about it is the triangle handle."
5,I love it!,"Okay so all these other reviews say that it can collapse, which got me worried. So my husband and I went to the store to try it out ourselves and talked with a specialist there. The 2005 model can collapse with a push of a button but the 2006 version can not. In order to collapse it you have to hold down a switch and push a button at the exact same time. With the 2005 model you could accidentally hit the button at any time. My husband and I love this carrier especially for its triangular handle, which is great for men with larger hands. I would recommend this to anyone!"
1,BUYERS BEWARE,"I am so fortunate that before I opened my box, I read the reviews on the stroller collapsing while the car seat is in it. I went to the store and tried it for myself and was shocked to see when it folded foward, the car seat dumped head first into the ground. I am SO GLAD that I found this out and am able to exchange the system for a safer one that folds inward not foward."
1,Bad buy.....very dangerous,My wife and I bought this duo in August for our daughter who is now 8 months old. We recently took a vacation and used the stroller only from the duo to tote our little one around. When our daughter fell asleep in the stroller in the reclined position her head would fall into the area between the bars on the side and the actual back support. This would cause her head to get stuck and we would have to wake her up to get her head out. In my opinion the stroller is also very hard to manuver and it is very large compared to the stroller we used with our first daughter. We are looking into buying a new stroller because of how dissatisfied we are with this product.
1,Malawi Travel System,"I went to the local Babies'R'Us and was looking at this stroller/car seat combo since it matches our theme. It looks wonderful and I would've purchased it, but there is one very bad safety issue! You can collapse the stroller with the car seat still in it. It's not something people would do on purpose, but the button to do so is on the handle used to push the stroller. So if you are pushing the stroller with the baby in it you could actually collapse the whole thing and injure the baby accidentally. I think this product should be recalled, and strongly urge anyone who is thinking about purchasing it to see for yourself. It is very dangerous and I would recommend going with the Graco set instead. It is the same price range, light weight, and definitely a safer option."
3,Heavy & Akward Stroller,"I like the stroller but I wish I would have known what I know now. I had the ""had to have everything fancy"" new mommy blues. I didnt know then what was important. For example how much I can do with one arm, mean while holding my son. I wish I would have gotten a lighter stroller that was less akward to lift and open. Good luck..."
4,It has been a good stroller so far.,"I have last year's model that was lime green and gray. But everything looks the same as far as the construction of the stroller. I have liked everything about this stroller, except the way that the seat adjusts in the back. My six month old wants to sit up in the stroller at the toy bar, and the back adjustment strap only goes so far. I saw a baby in a Graco model that allowed her to sit up really high at five months. Everything else on this stroller works great for me. We live in the suburbs so it is easy to pack in the trunk and go to the mall. The only other issue was the base that came with the stroller. It was made of plastic and just doesn't work very well in the car. We were able to buy additional bases that were heavy metal construction that I felt were much safer in the car."
1,You don't understand,"Michael T Worrell must not read very well. No buttons were pushed, no parents collapsed the stroller with the their baby in it, no ""poor parenting"" occurred in any of the 12 reviews where parents had this stroller collapse on it's own. This stroller is dangerous and is under investigation by the Consumer Product Safety Commission for recall. Michael's attempt at sarcasm and humor about dumb parents only weakens his argument."
3,If you plan on having another baby in the next three years think twice,"I have an earlier version of the BabyTrend travel system and I loved it--it has taken quite a beating with my 20 month old son. I will be having a second child in two months so I have been researching double strollers. I wanted to get the BabyTrend Double since I liked the single so much. Well.. it turns out that the BabyTrend Double Stroller accepts other infant carriers brands, but not BabyTrend Infant Carrier. I have verified this with BabyTrend Customer Service. If my son where a year older, I would probably get the Sit&Stand where the infant carrier fits, but he is too young for it now. So now I am looking at buying a double stroller, new infant carrier car seat--and I no longer have a single stroller that will work with the new infant carrier."
1,This is the worst unit I have ever seen,I went looking for a travel system when I was pregnant. This was my first child so I wasn't completely sure what to look for. I went to the store and I played with several strollers. I liked how this one released in the front. I liked that it wasn't all dark blue since I didn't know what I was having. I liked how the car seat connected to the stroller. I loved the handles and how easy they were to hold. I loved the one hand stearing on the stroller. Then I had my daughter and I went to put her in the car seat. She wasn't a big baby she was 7lbs 4 ounces when we left the hospital and the straps already felt too small. I had to push and tug to get it to snap. It was horrible. She is now 7 weeks old and I can't use it because I can't buckle her in without pushing on her stomach hard. Babies R Us was wonderful and they allowed me to return it. I will never buy anything from Baby Trend again. I called them first and their customer service was horrible.
2,Heavy Load,"I have this system (in a different pattern) because the carseat was highly rated on consumer reports. The carrier is very HEAVY. Way too heavy to carry around with baby in it. The stroller is nice, but I hate that you need two (or more) hands to fold it then it slams into the pavement scratching up the front tray. It too is very heavy and bulky compared to its competitors."
1,Safety issue,"I agree with Megan Mitchell's (from North Carolina) review. I am due in February and was in the store comparing strollers. You can easily Collapse this stroller WITH the infant seat in place, which tips the infant seat forward, dumping the baby out if the child is not strapped in. Imagine another child ""playing"" with your stroller and collapsing it! In contrast, the Graco stroller folds forward, so if you try to collapse it with the infant seat in place, it won't fold down (plus the infant seat doean't tip forward in this case). And I did all this in front of a store manager.A word to anyone shopping for strollers - get to a store and try them. Don't just trust other's opinions or web research."
2,Needs work.,"I bought this system (in a different pattern) because the carseat was highly rated on consumer reports but no matter how I adjusted the carseat when it was installed, my babys head hangs over to her knees. It looks terribly uncomfortable! It is also HEAVY. Way too heavy to carry around with baby in it. About the stroller.. I think it is a nice stroller but I hate the fact that you need two (or more) hands to fold it then it slams into the pavement scratching up the very front of the stroller. I also hate the fact that you cannot have the canopy open so you can see the baby and have a drink in the drink holder at the same time. I do like that you can completely close baby up with the two (one from the carseat and one from the stroller). Whoever designed this thing obviously never tried to use it!!"
1,"Very Heavy, small and difficult to adjust","The handle on ours always sticks. Our son is high on the growth charts, but this carrier weighs a ton - 10 lbs in addition to the baby's weight - that's a lot. It's adorable, but if I had to choose again I'd go with another travel system."
1,I WOULDN'T BUY AGAIN,"We got this stroller in a different color/pattern because we liked it in the store. We had our baby in April 05 and we have hated the stroller ever since. No real complaints about the car seat, except it can be difficult to buckle at times but I'm not having all the problems of the child leaning to far foward or that it is too hard to install in the car. The stroller is the problem! TOO HEAVY. TOO AWKWARD TO FOLD. I had to get a new wheel after 2 weeks of use because if you don't adjust the wheels just so when folding you can damage a wheel! Customer service was poor but agreed to send new wheels for free. The stroller is annoying because once your child sits on his/her own he/she is still too small to see over the front tray. My child is 9 months old and the tray is in his face...so I typically use my mid weight stoller instead. This is not a problem with the GRACO my friend uses! DON'T BUY THIS!"
5,Great stroller and carseat!!,"I bought the malawi travel system and then read all the reviews about it flipping upside. If you do have an infant in the car seat and attached to the stroller, why in the world would anyone fold the stroller up?? The car seat will flip up when trying to fold the stroller up. The carseat is not made to be folded up along with the stroller and the stroller can not be folded up with the carseat still attached. There is however a 2 point safety feature to prevent an accident. you push a button to the side while pushing in another button. You have to do both at the same time and it does require some strength. The buttons are not even on the comfy handle, so why your hand would be in that area is beyond me. If you do not want the carseat to flip backwards, do not fold the stroller up until after you remove the carseat. There are other strollers that the same thing will happen. As far as the ride, this stroller is very comfortable and easy to manuever."
3,Carseat TOO SMALL!!,We got this shuttle system before our daughter was born and she weighs 14 lbs now and barely fits in the carseat anymore. The straps are WAAAAAY too tight and they are loosened all of the way!!! Don't get this carseat if you want it to last past the first month or two!
4,Amazing,"Tom Kimmel's demo set that reaches the ""Light of Day"" with this release is consistently strong. Kimmel's pop sensibility glows through every track, from the quiet to the peppy. The love songs ""Forever Man"" and ""(I Love) Falling in Love"" touch at the heartstrings. ""Pages"" is a lovely folk tune with Kimmel's vocals expressive, ""You know me, looking out through boxes & cages; & it's hard to clearly see what's right in ordinary light, Does the truth filter down through the ages?"" The set closes with the lullaby ""The Best Part of This World."" The CD has a very sparse feel, but Kimmel is in fine voice and his songwriting is as always, amazing. Enjoy!"
3,Mediocre...,"Nothing great about these grips. I don't think there is really anything 'gel' about them. They are more of just a firm rubber feel. Okay for the low price, but if looking for real comfort, I'd look further."
4,Beautiful and soft,Soft and beautiful pashmina. Perfect size. Arrived promptly. My only complaint is it is a more brownish color than the picture shows. I am keeping it because it is nice but I would have been happier if it were the orange color shown.
3,Warning-CONDENSED VERSION,"I ordered this book in hopes that it would be the same 200 page photo reference book that my friend had, but it was not. This book is only about 60 pages and does not cover all of the uniforms that I had wanted to see. I sent the book back and I am now in search of the correct one. Do not order this book if you are looking for the longer version."
3,"a nicebook on the red army, but...","""Red Army Uniforms of WWII..."" is a usefull book on the subject, but if you only want to buy one book on Red Army uniforms of WWII, I wouldn't recomend this one.The choice of uniforms is very appealing, but the photographs don't show the colors of the uniforms very well. Partialy this is due to all of the models being photographed against a bright red background ( probably as some kind of association with the chosen subject), partialy this is due to the lighting leaving something to be desired. This is a real shame, because otherwise the book would have been first rate!The book does offer some uniforms I have never seen anywhere else before, such as the late war camouflage uniform.If you would, for example combine this book with the book from Osprey Publishing on the same subject, you would have a good combination to start with."
5,This is what you've been waiting for.,"Nietzsche IS the greatest philosopher of modern times, and this anthology is the perfect place to start if you're a student or new to Nietzsche. It's also a great bargain and collects several works together that one would be spending extra money on to get separately. I strongly reccomend this, as the works in here ( especially the Geneology of Morals, and Beyond Good and Evil) are key. I have been highly satisfied with this purchase and I recommen buying this along with Viking's Portable Nietzsche."
4,Tough subjects,"Go figure that Nietzsche wouldn't be a crowd pleaser, but this is as good as it gets. Only better I guess it is the original language, I guess though philosophy Basic 101 for dummies will never be written."
5,the greatest,there're few books in the history of mankind that are more important than this collection of nietzsche's main writings. just read it in kaufmann's remarkable translation.
2,Eurocentristic,"And really, who needs that? My favorite is when he says blacks represent prehistoric man and don`t feel pain as much. Great Niet!!Just don`t let that get out of the proverbial bag ok? Before ya know it someone will sail up with an air of entitlement for ooohhh a few centuries of free labor while leveling insults of ""lazyness"". Oh well, thanks for the few things about humankind that you actually could see with a mote of clarity. P.S. I saw Jesus yesterday, was kinda pissed, called you a ""swaggerjacker"". You might wanna go take care of that."

2,Flakes Galore! Thick Sticky Goo!,"This gel looked really shiny and pretty upon application. My daughter had a few dry flakes where gel had been applied. I don't use a lot of gel on her natural curly hair, but sparingly with water, shea butter, curly cream.And when she went swimming, OMG. It looked white and gooey where the water hit the gel. I could really see the product build up.I let the gel air dry without a lid, it turned into a white sticky goo. It no longer looked like Clear Ice.A good wash with Infusium 23 took the goo out. Will definitely not use again. It's a wrap."
5,On the other hand . . .,"Although I've not read this book, after reading the vituperative attack above I feel I must mention that no less a critic than classics scholar Bernard Knox (himself as enjoyable to read as he is informative) has compared Kirk's book to Dodds' ""epic-making"" _Greeks and the Irrational_, saying of Kirk's work in myth that it ""presents the same stimulating combination of professional expertise and new perspectives."" Coming from Knox, this is high praise indeed.If you're looking for a quick ""who did what to whom,"" you'd best go with Edith Hamilton. But if you want an insightful and informed adult journey into the character and substance of myth, perhaps this is the book you seek."
4,"G.S. Kirk provides analysis, not fun","As a doctoral student, I would not recommend anything written by Kirk to anybody but an academic. What Kirk does is to deconstruct, in the technical sense, theories of myth in the agora that is the Greek pantheon, explaining how no theory can completely map upon the confusing state of Greek religious thought and text. It is not perfect but nevertheless sufficient. The reader would do himself well to reread Derrida prior to attempting Kirk's formulation of Greek myth."
1,"If you want to have fun, don't read this book.","I found this book highly unenjoyable. It was written well, if you are taking a doctorate level course, otherwise good luck. If you expect to learn what a Greek Myth is, Kirk will confuse the hell out of you!!! He does an excellent job of never giving his own opinions, but would rather belittle the thoughts of previous authors on the nature and beliefs of Greek Myths. Sorry Kirk, but I would have to give you two thumbs down for ease of reading, comprehension, and explanations on the Greek Myths."
1,I couldn't agree more,"...I knew Birdie well and know a lot of people who also knew Birdie well and none of us believe that Birdie authored this book. The man we all knew is not represented by the words on these pages. For example, Birdie wrote an article titled, ""I'd Rather Catch"". This was written by Birdie himself and Birdie spoke about it many times. In the article he praised Newhouser. Having known the man, I never heard him ever criticize another player. On the contrary, he was one of baseball's biggest fans. And he most certainly did not talk like the blue collar, swaggering, swearing person represented on these pages. This is a book published many years after his death. I would keep that in mind as the pages are turned."
1,Not the Birdie I knew,"Birdie was a great storyteller. This book was not written with Birdie's sense of humor,intelligence, or respect for the people in the baseball industry. I knew him well and do not believe that he wrote it. Unfortunately, since he died three years before he supposedly wrote this book, we can't hear his side of the story. This book is just not worth the paper it's printed on."
4,"A Hoot! Think ""comic book"" not ""science fiction"".","The trailers led me to believe this was another pretentious big budget sci-fi bomb. I caught a few minutes of it on cable and was hooked. This is one funny movie! It also ranks very high in the ""eye candy"" category. If you come looking for DEEP MEANING, you'll be disappointed. If you disengage your brain, your eyes and funny bone will have a blast.Any fans of early 1980's ""Heavy Metal"" magazine will immediately pick up on artist Jean ""Moebius"" Giraud's influence. If you liked this movie's space opera feel, you should seek out his ""The Incal"" series, collected in three volumes.I'm 36, and a 49 year old co-worker and I keep busting each other up with quotes from this movie. ""Mul-Tee-Pass!!!"" Great fun."
5,SCI FI AND OPERA IN ONE MOVIE!,"PICTURE QUALITY IS FANTASTIC, AND THE AUDIO ON THE OPERA SCENE REALLY SHOWS WHAT THE DVD FORMAT CAN DO FOR FILMS THAT IS WHY I GAVE IT A FIVE STAR RATING. s.d.f"
4,A very fun movie,"The Fifth Element is not a movie to be taken seriously, but that is certainly not a bad thing. It is a movie that is just plain fun. It is rather over-the-top in a lot of ways but that is its charm. Well worth watching when you want a wild ride through an impossible future. The special effects are great and the humor ranges from tongue-in-cheek to outrageousGOOD SEE IT"
5,GREAT,This has to be one of the best sci-fi movies of all time. It was so fun to watch. This is the kind of movie you just have fun with. Everytime it is on TV I have to stop everything I am doing just to watch it. Even my husband likes this movie and he doesn't like sci-fi usually. Get this movie if you really want to be entertained.
5,Oh my gosh,"This movie is quite possibly the coolest movie I have ever seen, save The Matrix. Both dont let me confuse you, its nothing like the Matrix. Bruce Willis gives a great performance as a man who is forced to gather the 5 elements in order to save the planet. While that sounds like any other movie you may have seen, its not. in the words of Owan Glieberman of Entertainment Weekly ""This film is primed to explode. This is the RIDE."" it's constantly in your face, with fresh, funny dialouge. Gary Oldman is great in a strange role, and the pales in comparison to Chris Tucker. Forget Rush Hour, THIS is his break-out performance. he is Awesome in this movie, playing a talk-show host who has a penchant for wearing dresses and crazy hair doos. I've seen this movie countless times, and its still awesome. With a great plot, and an awesome cast (once again: Bruce Willis, Ian Holm, Gary Oldman, Milla jovovich, Chris Tucker) you can't go wrong. Very Highly Recommended."
5,"Great Movie, Great Quality","Having been a huge fan of this movie since I first saw it on DVD I was delighted to get a chance to see it in HiDef Blu-ray. I had read an earlier release of The Fifth Element on Blu-ray was lackluster at best, not having seen it myself I can't personally comment. However, this Remastered release on Blu-ray is incredible. The action is certainly not missing in this Bruce Willis flick, but just as much there's the comedy. Chris Tucker plays his character (Ruby Rhod) spot-on. Luc Besson does a phenomenal job putting so many ""elements"" together in this movie. This movie is not one-dimensional like most Action or Comedy movies. Well worth the time and money."
1,A major disappointment,"I had read a while back this film had been conceived while the director was a high school student, and frankly, it shows. The film starts out promising enough--the futuristic cityscape, changeling aliens, flying automobiles, and ostentatious cyber-fashions were a mesmerizing vision; however, this visual banquet quickly turns into so many empty calories after the first half-hour of the film. The rest is formulaic: a jaded elite military commando is recruited for a shoot-'em-up mission to save the world from a vague menacing entity which is never fully explained. He is paired up with a beautiful humanoid ""secret-weapon"" in scanty clothing who fights her battles with an unconvincing flurry of kicks and punches that never seem to connect with their recipients. In the end, this seems less like a serious sci-fi vision and more like a half-realized juvenile fantasy."
1,Won't play on my PS3!!!!!!!!!,"What a crock! I bought the PS3 last week and I've been able to play three other movies on my PS3 just fine, but when I try to put in The Fifth Element, it says that it can't play the video and gives me an error code. Of course, I can't find any documentation that will tell me what's wrong, so now I have to take it back to the store. This is really frustrating. Anyone else have this problem?(By the way, this is a great movie, it's just the disc that sucks)"
1,Maybe the worst movie ever made,If your over 12 years old you will have to agree that this is the stupidest movie ever made. It is Jaw dropping in its stupidity - you will truly hurl when you have a minute to ruminate over this movie - especially Chris Tucker's role as ...uh whatever he was doing.
1,NOT EVEN WORTH THE RENTAL!,"The Fifth Element is a fine example of a movie with a reknowned director, a big budget, a fine cast of actors, creative set designers yet when these ""elements"" are put together they still manage to make a HORRIBLE movie.It's NOT funny, it's NOT entertaining, the effects are POINTLESS random explosions, it's not even very creative. This is a stupid movie, stupid, stupid, stupid. I will never watch a new Luc Besson movie again. I left the theater at one point went to the restroom, played a video game or three, got some food, finally decided to return to my seat. THEY WERE STILL DOING THE SAME BIT!I saw this against better judgement, on a three dollar maintenee and I wanted my money back, I would have left after ten minutes but I had nothing else to do!Spare yourself, spare your children, this is like watching Barney and Friends for three hours without commercials!"
1,Pure and Utter Drivel!!!,"Bruce Willis and the others should give back their paychecks. This thing is REALLY bad. It apparently helps, when watching this, to be 12 years old and watching it for the 15th time. Noboby else's brain would be numb enough to take it."
2,"Well, . . . hmm . . .","I've read a lot of reviews and many of you people are right - this is quite poor movie! I really liked it first time I saw it. Later on it became quite cheesy to see especially the acting of Milla Yovovich. Well, . . . But still I like to see it from time to time."
2,"Derivative, undemanding sci-fi yarn","It's watchable and looks pretty, but the viewer is never sure whether to immerse themselves in the (extremely flimsy) plot or to play ""spot the rip-off"" from Blade Runner, Alien, Total Recall, Hardware etc. It's a mildly amusing couple of hours spent, but I just cannot believe the number of reviewers who've lowered their standards enough to give this 5 stars! C'mon folks, this ain't a classic!"
2,I don't understand why every loves this so much...,"Please no more reviews recommending this movie for ""scifi lovers""- All these reviews saying it's great scifi don't make sense to me, simply cuz of the main premise: a ball of evil threatening earth. Just thinking of it makes me chuckle.- And ""love"" being an ""element"" whatever that means, destroys said ball of evil. This is ""sci""fi???????? I watched it hoping for a good scifi flick and got a magical fantasy instead. Disapointment.- practically the best special effects ever and set designs. This is the only reason I give it even two stars"
4,EYE-POPPING FUN...YUM,"Anybody expecting a complicated story in this amazing movie should go to hell. This story is director Besson's imagination when he was a kid so it's pretty simplistic. But extravagant visual effect, colorful characters, amazing set and costume design, high dose of humor, Chris Tucker's incredibly over-the-top performance, and its optimistic view of the future will leave most viewers satisfied. Milla Jovovich is a bless for this universe. This film is destined to be a classic. (P.S. The two guys who wrote their comments under mine are idiots. Don't mind them)."
5,great movie,it is a great movie.With a lot of action and humour.Bruce Willes played really good and Chris Tucker was really funny.You have to see this movie.
1,Junk!,"Junk! Thing Skipped like crazy, was brand new but didn't play on computers, dvd players (3) Sucks normally the movies here are cheap and good, but guess they're getting cheaper every year."
1,"A terrible, frustrating movie","I hated this picture. Bruce Willis does an adequate job, but the character of Chris Tucker is enough to make any normal person sick to his or her stomach. It should be rated R, as it is not fit for minors."
1,Very Bad,"When I rented this, I thought this movie was absolutely wretched. I can appreciate camp. I love Rocky Horror. And I love sci-fi. Hell, you can even mix the two, and get maybe Ice Pirates, which was fun sci-fi camp. This movie was just immensely irritating. Chris Tucker? I never wanted a movie character to shut the hell up so much in my life. Nails on a chalkboard. I'm going to try and rent it again, to see if it's as bad as it was the first time around. Maybe I'll change my mind, but I doubt it. Lump it together with Tank Girl, only that had a few redeeming traits..."
1,My Jaw dropped......,"I could not believe how stupid this movie was..By the time Chris Tucker came on the screen with perhaps the most idiotic acting portrayal of all time(yes worse than Jar Jar), i was ready to Hurl..maybe its a French thing with Luc Besson..I cant think of anything else that could explain a movie like this."
1,"save your self, dont buy this :>(","OK, ill admitt, the story to this movie isn't half bad. But, the movie falls a long way down with a total lack of character development, terrible acting, and the kind of stupid humor that makes me want to take a hamer to this disc and turn it into dust. If you care at all about characters and a message in a movie, don't touch this one with a ten foot poll. If all you care about is action scenes, and people making dumb jokes, you might like it."
4,Audio/Visual Extravaganza,"This movie is quite frankly a feast for the eyes and ears. The story is fun and interesting, the acting never takes itself too seriously and it contains one of the most unusually beautiful scenes in recent memory - the singing of the Diva Plavalaguna. By itself, this scene makes the DVD worthwhile."
2,I was disappointed,"Gary Oldman is such an amazing actor, but his talents are wasted on this silly movie. Visually, this is quite a spectacle. But the plot is boring and uninteresting. I like Willis and Tucker, too, but both of their characters are just plain annoying. I can see how some people would like this movie, but it just didn,t work for me. Maybe I'll watch it again sometime and like it. Stranger things have happened."
4,Domestic Sci Fi,"This film is so visually exciting and clever enough to bring strange alien beings and a great story to our home planet. Bruce is as cool and irreverant as ever with the soft heart of his that makes risky and adventurous choices. Milla is sexy and totally believable as the ""perfect being,"" particularly her amazing alien language delivery. I've viewed the film four times and will do so again from time to time."
3,Its better then decent,I think this movie is decent. I don't think it was a waste of my money or time. Neither was it the best movie I've ever seen. I thought it had a clever plot. It was different and the special effects were pretty cool. The acting is good too. Overall I really think this movie is worth your while. Don't go into the movie expecting anything and you'll leave happy!
4,Good Movie,"This is a good movie. If you break it up into segments, the movie seems somewhat strange, but when it's over and you perceive it as a whole, you will enjoy the experience. I for one can proudly admit to accepting it among my collection. One thing I must note is Chris Tucker's role in this film. It is one you will probably never see him fill again. I for one will always remember him as 'Smokey' from Friday, so i can't help but chuckle each time I see his character in this sci-fi flick. I give it four stars."
1,Please! What were they thinking?!!,"Oh, my word! I have tried to watch this film numerous times and have lost interest within the first 20 minutes. I love films of all sorts, but this one just sucks. It seems that the director wanted to make everything completely over the top and he achieved his goal in spades, believe me. I skipped around to see if it got better and of course, it didn't. UGH!!! What a waste of talent! If you want to see something a lot better, try the entire Star Wars collection, Titan AE (animated, but still 100x better than this)or even Event Horizon. This will be a future film for the Mystery Science Theater guys to make fun of. Then, at least, it will be funny. At this point, it is just sad."
5,One of the Best Sci Fi Movies Ever,"I would rank this movie up there with the top 10 greatest Sci Fi movies. Special effects...stupendous. Storyline...excellent. Casting, Acting, Costumes...all top notch. If you don't own this movie, you should purchase it NOW!!"
3,Missing Off-Screen Dialogue,I wonder if anybody else caught the missing off screen dialogue on the widescreen side. Notably for when he's talking to his mother on speakerphone inside his apartment. I had English subtitles on and default audio setup...
5,Sci-fi at it's best,"I just recently saw this on Netflix, but once I saw it I had to own it. Can't wait to watch it again and again!"
4,A very funny space-opera spoof,"""The Fifth Element"" is a wonderful parody of a science fiction ""action adventure"" movie. As long as you keep that in mind, it's very entertaining. It has comedy, action, no sex worth speaking of, comic violence (I'm kinda surprised that Zorg's eyes don't bulge when he sees...nevermind), ugly aliens getting blown up, the end of the world, and a theory about where the Earth's moon came from. What else can you ask from a parody?The DVD contains no commentary, but there's really no way they could add such without ""explaining the joke"", which would make the movie pointless. I -do- wish that the ""chapter access"" allowed skipping to specific chapters, like some DVDs, but you apparently can't have everything."
4,Talk About Out Of This Universe!,"Luc Besson's greatest work yet! It's a little odd, but still..Bruce Willis, who plays Major Korben Dallas, a New York cab driver, is hilarious. This is what I have longed imagined what the world of the future would be like--flying cars, another world in space...like The Jetsons catoon, only with live people. The stroy's pretty good. Lots of thrills and zanny monster effects. But other than that, The Fifth Element is an action-pakced...edge of your seat thriller! Sic-fi fans I promise you this, you will not be disappointed in this fast-paced thriller."
5,i listen to it all the time.,"even when i am working, the instrumental tracks are good for background. the fast ones for staying awake, and the soothing ones for when there's too much to do and calming music helps keep me focused."
4,Blu Ray transfer Super Good---xtras lacking,"This blu ray transfer is Super Good----so if you just want the movie this is what you want to get. But, the video quality of the Ultimate Edition DVD is also quite good on my 42"" Visio 240hrtz TV with Blu Ray up-convert player and it has tons of great xtras that the Blu Ray doesn't have. Like:: (Over 120 minutes of never-before-seen exclusive featurettes: The Digital Element, The Visual Element, The Star Element, The Fashion Element, The Diva, Camera, costume, and set tests and more. There is also a Feature-length trivia fact track and that is the only thing on the Blu Ray disk.If I would have known this beforehand, I would not have bought the Blu Ray because I am a film nut and I enjoy all the extras almost as much as I enjoy the movie and there is so little difference in quality that it is almost negligible.It's really a great movie and worth watching many times so either way---it's a good buy."
4,"Good Movie, Okay DVD","The main reason I decided to purchase this movie on DVD was to get the higher quality due to the fact that I have watched my VHS copy way too many times. I was so happy to get the DVD that I didn't notice the lack of extra features. I was happy that they did have the scene selection which some DVD's lack. I did give it a 4 because it is an awsome movie. But overall, if you just HAVE to have this movie you might want to buy the VHS because you aren't getting much with the DVD version and you'll save a few bucks. I really did expect more with a person like Luc Benson behind the film."
4,Great DVD and a fun movie,"You notice I did not say a ""great"" movie. This is a reference quality DVD transfer. I have had the disc since release and very few if any DVDs since have surpassed it in terms of audio or video quality. Beautiful scenery (the opera scene for one - notice the planet rising in the background) and fantastic Dolby Digital soundtrack combine to make this a disc that you invite your friends over to see.Now for the story. I liked it. It is another Bruce Willis saves the world from baddies, he's and ex-cop, ex-soldier storyline, but with enough juice behind it to keep me interested. The film editing was incredible (again, see the opera/fight scene)and it was not quite ""poo"" as one of the reviewers said. It was more enjoyable than Star Wars Episode 1, however, and I liked that film better than most."
5,"Great action, great music and great comedy.",This baby will keep you from going to get the snacks.Better hit the pause because you will not want to miss a single moment of this movie.
3,"yes, tricky is in this movie","Yes, Tricky is in this movie. The best part of the movie was the taxi chase scene and the flying chinese take out place, you totally have to see it, it's really cool. Plus, in this movie, instead of saying ""cool"" or ""tight"" they say ""green"". It's total entertainment, it'll be a cult flick, it's no Life Is Beautiful. It's more like a music video in a movie format (much like Batman Forever was)."
3,Tricky is in this movie,I watched this movie with my friends when we went out for a ghetto prom (we were juniors and were jealous of the seniors going to prom so we got dressed up in gowns and suits and went to a nice dinner and movie). I love Bruce Willis and the previews looked cool. Then... then... Tricky. Tricky is in this movie and he is my total favorite recording artist. I started screaming Tricky in the middle of the movie. That is why I bought this tape and the movie was ok. I liked the Taxi scene. I also like Gary Oldman. He's da man!.
1,yawn...,"1. An important disclaimer: I one of the few folks who never watched this when it came out and thus I'm viewing it from the vantage point of 2010.2. With the above being said, this movie is a total bore. The storyline was dumb, the acting terrible, and the whole ""look"" of the film was so ""dated""; it's one of the movies that doesn't age well over time. What may have appeared to be interesting and cutting edge, now looks childish and an amateur production.3. Basically, if you grew up with this movie, I can perhaps understand why is has appeal. But for those who have never seen it, don't bother with watching it now."
1,Awful Movie.,"Now I know why for nearly 30 years and counting movies, music, and television have been awful. Anybody that thinks this movie is a 4, or 5 Star film is either a small child, or a complete idiot. Garbage! Astounding reviews. Boy are we in trouble."
2,"Pretty good eye candy, but not much else.","Funny in spots, Willis gives his usual decent performance. Gary Oldman is an excellent actor, but his character seems to go aroud bored through almost the entire movie. Milla is a good actress, but hardly the perfect woman. Very good special effects, and I managed to maintain suspension of disbelief until the end, where Milla's character loses it because of the War entry in the encyclopedia she has been speed reading alphabetically throughout the movie. I would have thought there were plenty of show stoppers in earlier parts of the alphabet, like 'atrocity', 'Auschwitz', or even 'atomic weapons'."
2,Ho hum,"It was OK. I wouldn't recommend buying it though. The plot was interesting, but it is definetly not a classic"
2,Chris Tucker ruined this movie,"Movie started out great. I've never seen futuristic city scapes as cool on any film. But then the idiot that Chris Tucker plays shows up and makes Jar Jar Binks look like Han Solo. As soon as he came on the scene, I turned to the guy who owned the DVD and said, ""Please tell me he gets killed off early."" But no such luck. He had no redeeming quality, not funny, not important to the storyline. I want a DVD with all the awful Chris Tucker dialogue, and as much as his scenes possible edited out. I think it's possible and a wonderful proposition. In fact, I'm tempted to see if I can have a techno friend make one for me."
1,Why does Amazon post reviews for DVDs on the Blu-ray listings????,"This is really annoying! How is a customer supposed to know what people think of a Blu-ray release, when Amazon puts zillions of reviews from the DVD versions on the Blu-ray product pages!?Amazon, time to clean up this mess. Guess what??A Blu-ray release of a movie is a different product than the DVD release of the same movie!!!"
5,the fifth element,it has some very good action scenes and never a dull moment in it at all it is worth watching over again
4,fifth element remastered,"This movie is much better looking, since it has been digitally remastered. Sounds better with dolby trueHD, also!"
2,Very derivative with good effects,"Urgh! Bruce plays Bruce (as usual). Mila is gorgeous, and Chris Tucker is just so irritating that if I was Bruce I would have executed him on the spot just for talking. This is a typical Hollywood action production with all that this entails - too much noise, poor story, ridiculous explosions and ghastly soundtrack. I would skip it, but it might be worth watching on TV. Just remember to turn down Mr. Tucker. He is an insult to gay people!"
2,fifth element,I bought this title because it was written that Japanese subtitle was available for this title at product details.But it wasn't true.I'm very disappointed.
3,nor brd quality,"I am very disappointed! After hearing that the fifth element would finally get a proper remastered version I jumped at the chance to order now after finally watching it I can say I am not happy with it. The film is extremely grainy throughout I wouldn't even call it BRD quality more like DVD+ and i'm watching it on the best tv you can get at the moment which is the panasonic VIErA TH-P65VT20A 65""! The sound is very good though better than the DVD release for sure but I'm afraid to see the PQ is sub standard."
4,Relax and check your brain...,"This movie is a great goof of a movie, two hours plus of pure tongue-in-cheek fun. Bruce Willis looks a lot less bored than he has recently, Milla Jovavich (sp?) is luscious and Chris Tucker is a hoot."
4,The Fifth Element is a fun movie.,"I bought this movie because I can rewatch it and enjoy it as much or more than when I watched it the first time. It might not be a blockbuster, but it is a genuinely entertaining movie. I like Bruce Willis. I like the story. The cast is well put together. I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this film."
4,Love this movie,I love this movie! If you hate sci-fi you probably won't like it. I saw this movie in the theatre when it first came out and I fell in love with Milla.
5,Blu-ray does make a difference.,"After getting a blu-ray player I've begun transitioning my DVD libary to blu-ray. I was a little curious if older movies filmed before the HD era would look any better. Boy, does the change show. The picture is crisp and clear just like any modern movie, well worth the extra few dollars over the standard DVD. Oh, and this movie is awesome, if you like sci-fi even a little then you'll love this film."
4,Chris Tucker makes this movie...,"...Ironically, he is not on the cover...but some chick dressed in blue with octopus tentacles coming out of her head is...All joking aside, this movie is pretty good and Milla Jovovich is absolute hot!!!"
2,Disc is being re-issued by Sony,"Fairly poor image quality -- so bad, that Sony is replacing them all. I ordered this disc two days prior to the replacement offer being announced, so obviously I'm not happy to have to pay another few bucks to ship the disc to Sony and wait for the replacement."
5,Wow,I've loved this movie for years. The Blu-ray edition is fantastically sharp but the improvements to the audio over the standard DVD really blew me away!It made a really fun movie even better!
3,Stick to your old DVD !,"If you already owned the first edition of the Fifth Element DVD, I strongly suggest you hold on to it as upgrading to this superbit collection is not worth it. The old DVD is still highly rated in both picture and sound quality. The new disc add DTS encoding which I could only detect minor improvement (if any at all). This is the only superbit edition that I tried and frankly is disappointed by the hype printed at the back cover stating that the DVD is mastered using double rate compared to conventional DVD. Not worth upgrading."
4,"Superb Transfer, Stellar audio","Funnily enough I'd never watched this movie, even though other scifi flicks rank among my favourite movies. However now that I'd bought an Blu-ray player on impulse, I decided to check it out as it's one of the home theater afficionado's reference disks. What can I say? Being the third movie I've watched on Blu-ray the picture quality is unreal. I listened to uncompressed PCM audio with 5.1 analog out and I heard sounds I didn't even know my Onkyo home theater setup was capable of putting out, simply stellar! The diva scene is as if she's standing right there in my loft, polystyrene headgear and all.Great movie, glad I watched it for the first time in hi-def, made it that much more enjoyable. No extras so I give it 4 stars. What the heck are they doing with the 50 gb on these disks? At least they can throw some extras in."
1,What a stupid movie,This is perhaps the worst sci fi movie I have ever seen. The plot is filled with holes and nonsense. The movie tries to be cute in the most stupid and insulting ways.
1,This Really Deserves NO STARS,"This film is one of the worst movies I have had the misfortune of seeing. The story is horrible. Better acting has been seen in B-movies. The directing is...where is the directing? My mind was so fuzzy after watching this film that I could barely focus my eyes. I'm not even sure WHAT the plot was, and, guess what? I don't care either.Now I didn't expect that much out of Mila Jovovich. I did expect a little more from Bruce; his movies are usually a little more interesting than this. I expected light years more from Gary Oldman. Maybe he realized that actually trying to turn out a good performance in this thing was impossible.If I didn't know better, I would have sworn that Luc Besson was a 5 year old that liked to shout, ""Action"" and little else. People often cite ""good imagery"" when there's little else to praise in a movie. I can't recall being impressed with the imagery, but, then again, I had trouble focusing my eyes through more than half of it."
1,MISTEP AFTER MISSTEP,"SHPPIED WRONG ITEM. WANTED BLU-RAY VERSION. WROTE E-MAIL, YOU SHIPPED SAME VERSION AGAIN. STILL WAITING FOR CREDITS ON BOTH DVD THAT WERE RETURNED."
4,"Great Movie, Picture a Little Weak for Blu Ray","This is an awesome flick, one of my favorites. I didn't think the picture quality was much better than the DVD that I already owned, so I was a bit disappointed, and it isn't the directors cut with no real special features. So that is lame too, but the movie is great."
4,Blu-Ray Disc Review,"WARNINGI'm not reviewing the movie (plenty of those around) but the disc content itself!!! As seen on my Philips 60"", 1080i HDTV. And heard on My Polk Audio speakers powered by my Luxmann 400 Watts(RMS) Amp.-Video- 8/10 Film grain can be seen in wide angle shots-Sound-(Dolby 5.1)- 9/10 Nice dynamic range. Explosions and gun shots loud. You will want to compress sound for late-night viewing or if your sound system is limited.-Extras- 2/10 Anecdotal notes at bottom of screen during playback."
1,"OH GOD, the pain","I have rarely ever watched a movie as bad as this one. Sure, it's pretty to look at. Sure, it's sometimes funny. But, people, as a watched this movie, I realized what bad acting and terrible directing looked like. How did the excellent Iom Holm get a part in this mess. I guess he lost a bet. This is the Riven of films."
1,I had to fast-forward,"I know this movie is critically acclaimed and that alot of people really like this movie, but I thought it was horrible. I think Bruce Willis is great and he usually makes good selections, but I can't imagine what he was thinking with this one. I found the plot to be weak and relatively hard to follow but it wasn't really the plot that made it so bad; it was the acting. Bruce Willis is a fine actor so his performance was good, but not good enough to carry this film. The remaining actors seemed to walk right off the set of Starship Troopers (the hands down worst movie and acting I've ever seen) -- the actors seemed like they just got their lines the day of the shoot. There was no emotion when there should have been, there was no conviction, no connection even to the scenes they were in. The special effects were decent but still not enough to make this movie worth watching. There have only ever been two movies that I fast forwarded through parts of and this is one."
1,Just another sci-fi movie,This is just another of those sci-fi movies which failed to hold my attention for the full length of the movie. It has the oft repeated line of total destruction and the hero trying to save the world. Poor story line and No great special effects make it just another sci-fi movie.
2,pretentious and contrived,"Being a huge fan of the science fiction genre, I was delighted to learn of a sci fi movie whose theatrical release I somehow missed. And Bruce Willis playing the hero being means it must be a sure fire hit, right ?Wrong ! This was truly the most contrived and unimaginitive piece of drivel I have seen in a long time. And no, I'm not ""slow"" or unsophisticated. I just didn't see any ideas here which had not been done, significantly better, by Star Trek, Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark. The only character I found modestly intriguing was the opera singer alien. And she got wasted rather quickly, leaving only the highly stereotypical characters. The above average visuals were not enough to redeem the tired plot.My advice is rent it if you are really curious. It was certainly not worthy of being added to my fine sci fi DVD collection."
3,Review Fifth Element,The quality of blu-ray image is fantastic but I remembered the movie being better. It's decent but far from great.
2,Silly.,"If only they had another director (perhaps Ridley Scott, using a little ""Blade Runner"" flair), this movie could have had the potential to be very good. Instead, director Luc Besson (""Leon,"" aka: ""The Professional"") chose to formulate this sophomoric piece of sour eye-candy that even the geekiest science fiction aficionado would despise. Aside from the poor direction, Hudson Hawk paired with an androgynous (and extraordinarily annoying) Chris Tucker sidekick, is enough to drive anyone to mercilessly strangle a kitten."
4,How a fashion designer would make a sci-fi film.,"It's pretty light on the science, but great on the fantastical fiction. If I had two descriptive words to describe the movie I would make it ""Fun"" and ""Fruity"". The colors of this DVD are vibrant and the sounds are powerful. Bruce Willis does a better than average turn as the tough talking, yet sensitive Ex-killer, turned taxi-driver.Some scenes are off place, like the rockin diva and most of the scenes with Chris Tucker and why do all the guys on the pleasure ships act like studdering idiots? Anyway, these are pretty small complaints and this movie was different from the typical movies that came out that summer."
4,Blue over gold,"this film was really beautifull, now with Blu-ray it becomes a work of art. I'm glad to be able to buy Blu-ray DVD's in amazon even from portugal. The only thing that is not so good is the fact that the subtitles are in brasilian insted of being in portuguese. never the less it is great to buy on AMAZON"
4,A great science fiction/ action movie. 4 and 1/2stars,"I usually like every Bruce Willis movie and once again, I liked this one. I have seen this movie many times and like it more every time. The movie takes place in a very well made futuristic earth where a cabbie ends up with a mysterious lady in his cab. And then, he finds himself needing to save the world from a very dark evil.The movie has a stellar cast with Bruce Willis, Mila Jokovich, Gary Oldman and Chris Tucker in a hilarious role.The movie has some very well made vilains that have some cool guns. The action scenes are great and Chris Tucker is actually hilarious as a very freaked out and feminine dude.The conclusion wasn't as good as it could have been but this movie ends up being UMBELIEVABLE (as Chris Tucker would say) with awesome special effects, memorable vilains, great acting, and awesome nonstop action.This is one that needs to be in everyone's collection."
5,"Excellently-Awesomely-""way cool"" movie","This is, by far, one of my favoritest movies ever. The whole thing was just, phenomenal. The special effects, the action, the everything. And the plot was excellent. I dont think that many people realized it, but the best part of the movie was the set-up. A movie about the Wiccen beliefs. The beliefs in the power of the water, the fire, the earth, the wind, and the fifth element, spirit. All this with a futuristic twist. Fantastic. In conclusion, if you havent seen this movie, you probably should. Or at least think about seeing it. I have seen it many times. And let me tell you, its great."
5,Everybody needs Love!!,"I admit I may not know what love is, but this movie showed me the key to all livin' ""LOVE!"" Everybody needs some love. That certainly showed that even a supreme being needs love as well. I am a huge fan of Sci-fi/Action movies but this film towards the ending brought out the soft side in me!! This movie has great special effects,good actors,great costumes(well you get the picture) So if you haven't watched this movie get yourself to the nearest movie rental place and rent it. I guaruntee you'll just love it!!!"
4,"Not Star Wars, more like Buckaroo Bonzai or Lost Starfighter","This flick is not meant to be a serious sci-fi experience like Star Wars, Trek, Dune, or Stargate. If you're looking for such a movie, look elsewhere. If you're in the mood for something entertaining, lighthearted but not intellectual check this film out. It should keep you amused like ID4 or JP2 and has some nice special effects and very colorful scenery. BTW, I think this film has one of the best opening sequences I've seen in a long time. Enjoy..."
3,Whatever,"Well first I'll start with what I liked about the movie. The special effects were wonderful, Milla did a very convincing bit of acting as leeloo, and I love Gary Oldman. Now, moving on. Bruce Willis was typically, well.. Bruce Willis. If you like him you'll like this. However all I could think when I saw this was, ""Look! It's Die Hard With a Purpose!"" Oh by the way, Have you seen ""Heavy Metal""? Hint, hint. Seriously there was a lot of theft from Heavy Metal in this movie..not borrowing, I mean theft. I'll watch it, but I wouldn't buy it."
3,Good SF flick,"Visually, THE FIFTH ELEMENT is a stunner. Anyone who ever doubted that a French writer/director couldn't handle a big budget Bruce Willis extravaganza will have to manger his chapeau. And for those of us who like our Sci-Fi mixed with a little mysticism, Luc Besson's film does it better than say THE BLACK HOLE or EVENT HORIZON. And who could deny that Milla Jovovich isn't perfectly cast as the embodiment of the divine? The film is quite entertaining, and a cut above the usual Willis fare. His bleach job alone should tell you that they were going after something a little different here. Still fans of the wise-cracking adventure hero should still love it, and those who just like an oddball futuristic yarn with great visuals and a sense of humor should go for this as well. Not deep space nor deep thinking but still good intelligent fun."
3,Millions of dollars for a good laugh...,"This is what this movie offers you. It's no a classic, but has its good moments. TUcker's character is the lowest part of the movie, overacting, annoying, ennerving. The rest is good, and Willis is charismatic in this one."
4,Style Over Substance,"This film really deserves 3 1/2 stars, but i decided to be generous and round up. If you are looking for a science fiction film with some substance, this film is not recommended. But if you are looking for a film that has a great and original style, both visually as well as musically, The Fifth Element is for you. It is the unique flavor of this film which makes me enjoy it so much. The costumes, the special effects, the music: they are all great. The characters are all great and wild too, even if a bit unrealistic. Willis is really the only uninteresting character, even though he is the protagonist. Zorg is a great villain.If you want to see a fun, unique film, watch the Fifth Element."
3,Ian Holm makes the movie,"A terrible plot but there are some really funny scenes and some great one-liners. A film you just can't take seriously. Ian Holm, most people will remember as the robot in Alien, has great comedic timing. Some very good visuals as well. I keep this DVD in my collection for Holm's performance as well as the visuals."
5,a Film for Generations,I want to say first this Is the greatest B movie of the Decade.Why rehash the plot for you again?I will say this movie will get dusted off every generation for a long time to come.If you have not seen It do yourself a favor and get to a rental store promptly. If you have and now perhaps have a widescreen TV-again I say do yourself a favor and watch It again. In It's original presentation this movie Is fantastic to watch and with a big enough budget for a classic they produced one! The special effects are seamless even the one's taking place on earth where It's harder to make realistic.Unless you just plain hate Sci-Fi this movie has something for everyone to love.Bruce Willis picked this movie when he was still on the very top list In Hollywood. It may not be Bladerunner but It Is a runnerup.Being In Blu Ray makes the movie perfect and deserving of the full 5 stars.
3,Good,You really can't go wrong with this movie I enjoy it alot.The only reason I gave it 3 stars is some movies they get old after awhile even though they are classics but this is still one of my favorites.
4,Creative and fun,"I can't say much that other reviewers haven't already said. This is a fun movie to watch, a bit happens in the early 20th century, but most of the story happens in the future and revolves around a cab driver and this weird girl called Leeloo and their quest to save the world by looking for the physical representations of the four elements and keeping them out of the hands of the bad guys. There's some messages here about the environment and war, so this isn't just some pretty film to watch."
3,"Good video, inferior sound","I still have the DVD version of this. Why? While the video quality is definitely superior, the sound quality is nearly unacceptable. The audio transfer was mixed at too high of a level, so certain effects (like the loudest pulse in the intro credits) clip at -0dB. I'm not sure how they let this blu-ray out the door.The movie is otherwise excellent. Sadly, the sound quality on the blu-ray really gets in the way of the experience."
4,A favorite,"This is one of my favorite movies. I found it entertaining with action and comic relief. The blu-ray version isn't worth it though - wait for the bargain bin or get the regular dvd. I have both versions and while the blu-ray is better, I don't think its worth the full price tag. I've watch this movie several times over the years and enjoy it each time. For whatever reason, the part with the blue lady singing always annoyed me - that's the only part of the film I don't like."
1,"Great movie, terrible transfer","A great sci-fi movie but this is a terrible transfer (there was apparently no attempt to clean up the master before the transfer to HD); my Superbit version of the movie upscaled by my Blu-Ray player looks much, much better.Sony will be releasing an new version with better picture quality sometime soon; they are also working on a program to trade in this poor version for some kind of credit/refund when you buy the new one."
5,A very cool movie,I LOVE this movie. A definite must-see. I watched this movie for the first time with an ex-boyfriend and I just loved the feeling it gave me. We were watching this movie about the meaning of love and happiness and why Earth should continue to exist...which is for love. It was recently on TV (3 years after I saw it with my boyfriend) and I was so excited that it was on I couldn't do anything else. This movie just always makes me feel so good about life and love...and myself. Definitely a movie that I could watch 100 times in a row and still want to watch again.
5,One of my favorite movies,"I love this movie, in fact I'm going to have to watch it again this week now that I have been reminded I have it. Oh yeah, superbit is pretty cool, but I bought the superbit version as a gift for my parents."
2,"Great Movie, Horrible Blu-ray Remaster","What a disappointment! I own this movie on DVD and it is one of my favorite sci-fi titles. But I rented the Blu-ray version and was sorely disappointed at the quality. My first impression, flying through asteroids, was that there was no improvement in quality from the DVD, but it's hard to tell at that point. Then the bright earth scene in the desert flashed in front of me and it looked horrible. It looked like I was watching a dirty copy of a film in a dollar theatre -- and it didn't get any better. I popped in my own DVD and my initial impression was right: there is little difference between the DVD and the ""remastered"" Blu-ray version. I really wanted to buy the Blu-ray version, but I'll stick to my original."
3,Movie Buff,A silly but well paced sci fi action film. Excellent special effects. You know the good guys will prevail but how they prevail against all odds will keep you interested til the end.
5,LOVE this movie!!!,"What can I say? Bruce Willis is at his best, and Milla, an actress, a model, and a singer, all in one, (no, not in the movie), brings her character to life in a beautiful way, like the unfurling of a rose.The clincher for me was the character, Plavalaguna, the Diva, whose singing performance left me STUNNED. Granted, although I knew it was a bit tweaked, her vocal performance on stage, as well as her presence is enough alone to see this movie, if just to watch her perform ""The Mad Scene"" from the opera, ""Lucia Di Lamamoor"". A REAL twist on it, that one must see to experience."
4,Well worth the money,"I purchased this film not only becaused I liked it but because it was in superbit. The overall quality of the film was amazing, however I was suprised that the sound was not as amazing as I would have expected it to be. I find I got much better sound from Gladiator and other films. I have a DVD player that upscales to 1080i...did I honestly see the difference...yes but not as much as I expected. Overall well worth the money thanks to the special features being included on a second disc as well. Colors are beautiful as well."
5,Bonus features are a nice added touch for a great movie,"The quality of the movie is much better than any of the TV versions I have watched. More importantly, you can hear everything being said, unlike on TV. What small bits of nudity in this movie were not missed in the TV versions, however there are whole scenes often cut out on TV. Love the movie. This is a two disc set with bonus features which are intersting as well."
1,.,"Flashy visuals, imaginative or no, can't help this pathetic, silly mess of a film. It is difficult for me to accept that this comes from the same director that gave us The Professional. A bad, bad movie that tries hard to be hip and fun, and fails miserably in both attempts. A thoroughly unacceptable, extended, and stomach-turningly boisterous intrusion by Chris Tucker, in the last 45 minutes or so of the film, further spoils what was already a rotten, convoluted, goofy effort."
1,Awful crap,"We can't believe this load of crap was called Star Wars for the ninties! Three of us were watching it. One fell asleep as the other two watched a ridiculous plot with annoying as hell characters unfold. If you have insomnia, this movie is recommended but if you vomit frequently, don't watch it!"
1,Doesn't cut the mustard,Bad news and sleazy. If you want a great movie with Bruce Willis I would get the 12 Monkeys. But the Fifth Element severely lacks class.
1,this was a movie?,"The Fifth Element would have made a fine music video, and the best parts of it (which, undeniably, means the fastest, loudest, and most glittery, as there is, as far as I can see, nothing else here) could easily be pared down into 4 or so mintues. How about it, Luc?"
2,don't waste your time,"blu-ray(re-mastered) quality is one of best pictures yet. unfortunately, the movie is not. too dull and boring for me!"
1,Typical formulaic garbage.,"If your not a fan of good sci-fi and are extremely bored then you'll probably like the flash and stupid comedy of this worthless piece of tripe. The only bright spot in this mess is Gary Oldman who, as usual, is magnificent. The plot is as predictable as an episode of ""Laverne and Shirley"" and just about as annoying. It just proves the theory that the time is past when movies could stand on special effects alone. Don't bother."
2,SUPERFLUOUS,"At best, Milla Jovovich is cute here. Bruce Willis is doing what he does best... acting heroically in next to impossible circumstances. And Gary Oldman, well, we have all seen him in better performances as better villains virtually disappearing into his roles. He does not succeed in doing that here. The plot is not necessary to elaborate upon. It is superfluous. This film is not worth your time."
2,Very over rated movie,"I write this review in the hopes that the majority of the public does not get deceived by over rated reviews floating around the web. I have tried to keep an open mind but the movie is nothing more than a comic book brought to the big screen or DVD as the case may be. The movie is most similar to Star Wars but is not anywhere as high quality. The Fifth Element has virtually no plot or story line and is really as series of unrelated visual elements. The quality of the sound track is great and perhaps the visual quality of the movie itself is great--but beyond that, there is nothing... I purchased this DVD because Armageddon was fairly good with spectacular special effects and had Bruce Willis in it. I am surprised he consented to be in this movie. I rated The Fifth Element two (2) stars but it may really only be a one (1) star movie. [End of review]"
5,Head and shoulders better then the previous Blu-Ray.,"Got this via Sony's Exchange program earlier in the week. All is have to say is WOW! Pardon the cliche, but as many times as I've seen this movie, watching this remastered version made me felt like I'd never seen it before. I noticed so many details on the screen this time. Kudos to SONY for fixing their mistake and selling it to new buyers for an reasonable price.One only minor gripe is that SONY should have added more extras on the disc, that would've made this a perfect disc."
5,Unparalleled success...,"..in bringing the graphic novella (Metal Hurlant aka Heavy Metal) to life. The first time I saw this on the big screen in 1997 I immediately recognized it for what it was: a sci-fi ""comic book"" come to life! OF COURSE the characters are cartoonish, and the plot is thin and laughable - but what eye candy, and accompanying humor!!! To me, there was no mistaking the elements of late '70s-to-early-'80s Heavy Metal-style sci-fi. The flying cars, intensely claustrophobic interiors, and the intense color schemes and outrageous costumes immediately brought to mind the work of Moebius and his brethren of that time. Hats off to Luc Besson for bringing this world to life in the movie. The DVD features loads of extra stuff (2 hrs. worth), so, for the uninitiated, it will all help to make sense of this fantastic effort."
1,The Fifth Element (Blu-Ray version),"""Now it's time to look at my first Blu-ray Discs. Naturally, my hand swerved towards The Fifth Element. The title was an amazing bit of reference work on standard DVD, and that Superbit version was awesome. Obvious choice, right? Should look amazing in HD. Yeah... it should. But it doesn't. In fact... I'm going to come out and say it looks bad,it is easily the worst looking high-definition title I've seen yet, and I've seen 30+ titles now. The image is muddy looking, lacking in crisp, clean detail. The colors don't quite pop off the screen like they should. This title should not have been released in Blu-ray format. Seriously, if you compare the upscaled Superbit standard-definition DVD to this, the Blu-ray Disc looks only marginally better. This should have been a reference title in high-def and it's not even in the ball park. My brow furrowed in troubled surprise at this point. Wow... and not the good kind."
5,Must See!!,I'm a big fan of this movie. I've lost count of how many times I've seen 5th Element. Seeing it in Blue Ray was like seeing it for the first time. There were so many details I never noticed before. A must buy for your collection!
4,Worth Collecting - Behind the,"I bought this DVD from Amazon. I always wanted to know what's going on behind the scene. A must have if you're a collector, fans of Bruce Willis and Milla Jovovich. Disc 2 contains an interview with Milla - on how she failed her first screen test for Leeloo and loss of her hair before the actual shooting. An interview with Bruce Willis and a very special interview with Mawenn Le Besco aka Diva Plavalaguna. Disc 2 also contain the making of Mangalore and Mondoshawan - the bad and good monster creatures. It's really worth collecting this Ultimate Edition."
5,"Forget Star Wars, This is the new standard in Sci-Fi","My all time favorite movie. The Fifth Element perfectly blends great sci-fi action, comedy, and in the end, a powerful, dramatic message of our weaknesses and strengths as humans that universally bond us together above all else. Luc Besson has crafted an outstanding film in every way, and the visuals of this year 2259 world are alone a must-see. END"
3,slighter better than super-bit,"After comparing Blu-ray and Super-bit of Fifth Element, I can say that the Blu-ray has the better picture but not by much. While the image is slightly sharper, it is NOT jump-off-the-screen sharp as it should be. Get this ONLY if you don't own a previous version. If you do, wait for the supposed 2nd Blu-ray release that Sony is allegedly working on."
1,A monumental folly,"The film can only be described as a mess. If ever the term ""style over content"" applies, it is to The Fifth Element.The acting is atrocious throughout. Milla Jovovich walks about in a daze (and the conceit of Luc Besson casting his girlfriend as ""the perfect being"" is obvious). Another reviewer stated that ""Gary Oldman...as usual, is magnificent"". The only suprise about Oldman (who spits out a succession of terrible clichéd lines) in this film is that someone manages to be camper than him. Namely, Chris Tucker. Screaming like a girl once is, perhaps, amusing. Doing it for 2 hours really starts to GRATE. Ian Holm looks embarressed by the whole thing, while Tricky proves why he didn't get any more acting gigs after this.Art directed to within an inch of it's life, this film is only for those who have a interest in unfeasiable fashion styles and/or idiotic sub-comic book childish idiocy."
1,"hendy, Milton Keynes, England","Complete poo! Buy this movie at your peril. It starts out really nicely in a Stargate-y style ""lets'decode the hyroglyphs and discover aliens behind the egyptians"" type way which is ok and rapidly deteriates with flying 1950's style cars. Chris Tucker is OK but his character is embarrassing - as well as the horrible diva bit near the end. What was the menace? you'll never find out and if the super being is so super, why does she spend most of the time drop kicking baddies? I bought this and feel robbed of two of the most emetic hours of my life - absolute pony! Obvious brain ticking to work out how to activate the machine at the end when my son of 4 knew! Good bit when Chris Tucker flounces out of scene after being startled by the young priest right at the end. Total bollocks tho :("
3,Dated,"This was an innovative and wonderful movie when it came out. However, the sets and special effects are dated. The blu ray version doesn't do much to improve the visual quality. The sets look like cardboard and the cars, which are suppose to be futuristic, are funny. Compare the movie to Blade Runner and you will see a major difference. Buy Blade Runner instead--it's a better movie with exciting visual effects."
5,Multi-Pass,multipass super green.. chris tucker dodges wearing the dress with class- if you know about the black actors have to wear a dress debate.
2,Chris Tucker is the only reason I like this movie,"The first time I saw this movie, I feel asleep out of boredom and confusion. Then Ruby Rod appears and steals every scene he's in. I mean come on, the man recored himself having sex, then played it for another girl, it doesn't get any better. The film does have good action sequecnes though, but Tucker still makes it for me."
5,The Fifth Element,"A cult movie as it was released. Will join the likes of Blade Runner and Rocky Horror as must haves in any collection.Brilliant Story, Brilliant Music AND Milla!"
3,Humor sci-fi,"No, this is not Star Wars, although the Fifth Element seems to be aiming for the epic feel. The storyline does feature several loopholes and omissions (if Leeloo is so repulsed by violence, why did she finish off a whole troup of Mandalores bare-handed?), and the villians are laughable. Naturally, as this is a Bruce Willis movie, some laughter is expected, but the movie's greatest assets are the mind-boggling visuals and colossal music scores (I am still listening to Diva's song every day when I fall asleep). This is space opera mixed with comedy at its best. Watch this movie many times, preferably in a row, if you are looking for some cheap, enjoyable entertainment. If you are looking for substance, give Fifth Element a try, look for awhile. I found little."
5,"Wow. Great story line, nice characters..","Perfect women saves universe, need I say more? Oh yeah bruce willis."
4,A very good glimpse of the future,"The plot was OK, but compared to other futuristic movies and tv shows, a very good idea of life in the future. One time, I saw a tv show that took place in 2013 and there were colonies on the moon and mars, and time-travel! I was so shocked, I could feel the electrical current frying my recliner (pun intended). This was very realistic for the 25th century. No aliens. No time-travel. No crap."
3,This flick is a misunderstood jewel,"It is hard to find a science-fiction flick that can entertain while not taking itself too seriously. The Fifth Element is one of those flicks. It is action-packed, funny, and subversive at the same time. Any flick with Tiny Lister as the Leader of the Free World gets my money every time."
3,"Bit grainy, but better than DVD quality I guess","This is not a movie review, this is primarily about the quality of the latest Blu-Ray remaster for this movie.It really isn't all that much better than the DVD quality, kind of gets grainy a lot in scenes. I was disappointed after the amazingly crystal clear blu ray version of Galaxy Quest.Well the upside I suppose is I get to watch one of my favourite movies of all time in slightly better than DVD quality."
4,Fifth Element - Saving the World again,"I've seen this movie a thousand times, probably like everybody else. It's an interesting movie. Funny at scenes. It would never happen in reality, but that's why it worked as a movie."
2,"Good Movie, but no extras","The movie is fun to watch, but there are no extras included with this DVD. A ""Making of"" would of made this a better DVD or even something about the FX, but neither was included on the DVD and that was a great disappointment."
4,Great until the last 5-10 minutes,"I really love the energy of this movie. It's fast paced and vibrant. Gotta love the Gauthier costumes and futuro-dada sets. I love the Ruby Rod character; he's over the top and outrageous. You just have to put aside your own inhibitions and watch him go. Think drag queen gone wild - faaabulous! The entire film has a heightened, frenetic, ultra-vivid feel to it.Until the very end. Unfortunately, the ending is too sappy for my taste. I felt let down by the filmaker; he seemed to be going for cheap sentimentality, rather than finishing the film at the high level of energy of the rest of the film. I tend to stop the movie as the yatch pulls away from Floston Paradise and heads back to Earth. For this reason, 4 stars rather than 5.That said, don't let this keep you from getting this DVD; the rest of the film more than makes up for the ending."
3,image,"why does the ""The fifth element"" page show a picture of ""A knight's tale"" instead. it does the same in the gold box, if i ordered it which would i get.don't post this, fix the picture."
4,Great quality BLU RAY,"I always though that the director's movies are a little bit over the top except <Nikita>This movie is a bit annoying too.But I bought this Blu-Ray disc because this movie is a Science fiction film and I liked the visual.The disc is almost perfect in terms of picture and sound.I wonder when there will be true 7.1 released but other than that, this disc is truly satisfied."
2,A dive for Bruce Willis,"Did not care for this movie at all --> probably the worst film ever for Bruce Willis. Yes, I went there --> EVER"
5,Reference Material. Plain & simple.,"I've long been a fan of this film. Luc Besson's really got a masterpiece here. Lots of familiar faces here. Chris Tucker's performance is among his best. But, this review isn't so much about the film's content, as it is about the BD presentation.I saw the first release of this film on BD at a friend's house. It was no better than my copy on DVD. However, in this second spin, Sony stepped up and set the ship in the right direction, going back to the original source material.With the choice of uncompressed PCM or Dolby TrueHD audio, the sound is every bit as good as it was in the theater originally. The picture, all I can say, is absolutely stunning. This is what I'd call a reference title for showing off BD.For those who may care, we're playing it on a new Sony BDP-S350 (picked both up yesterday), which is cabled via a monoprice hdmi 1.3 cable to our Onkyo TX-SR606 AV Receiver, and in turn via another monoprice hdmi 1.3 cable to our Samsung LN46A650 tv."
3,"not worth blu-ray, good movie","this is my first blu-ray movie, and my experience so far is not very good. the picture looks just like a regular dvd, i hope other blu-ray dvds with have something better to offer.all in all, good movie, not worth it to buy it on blu-ray"
1,poor transfer to blu-ray,"Poor transfer to blu-ray, quality is comparable to the dvd version. Don't waste your money on the blu-ray version."
5,Good Stuff,"I was afraid that an ""older"" movie may not be able to be a ""good"" blu-ray, but I am happy to annouce that this is not the case, at least for this age of movie. The Fifth Element is one of my favorite movies, and I loved it in this format."
5,A Family Favorite,"This is a fun, campy, root-for-the-good guys film. There's are so many favorable comments about it that I won't detail all my favorite parts, except to plug one thing that doesn't seem to be mentioned much. That is the incredible Diva's Dance song. If you don't have the soundtrack to the movie, just close your eyes and only listen to her voice as this part of the movie plays. There are no special effects here. This is a real opera singer, Inva Mulla Tchako, using her real voice as a special effect! I'm not an opera fan, but the term ""vocal acrobatics"" applies. Ms. Tchako's vocal control and power are like the Cirque du Soleil Pole Acrobats converted into sound. There are no words to the dance - it is just magnificent and hard-to-believe sound."
5,Awsome Movie,Can't go wrong with buying this movie. Funny and entertaining. Bruce Willis not at his best but another great movie. A+
4,Really awesome cast,Fifth Element is a sci-fi thriller about an asteroid headed to destroy earth. The cast of Bruce Willis and Milla Jovavich are searching for 4 stones that will activate in order to destroy the asteroid along with Jovavich(the fifth element). Did not find this film appealing in commercials but liked it a lot. Though you might not be into sci-fi at least watch this film before you judge it.
4,Cinema Nocturna Review,"Fully shot on digital, this film or should I say movie crosses several genre boundaries. Mixing non-stop action with blood soaked gore and adding a Peter Jackson a la Bad Taste feel to it, this exhibits both pure craftsmanship and plain old entertainment. Garrett White's direction of this movie not only keeps you highly entertained, but has you also thinking and reaches for that shoe-in laugh as well. What a great start to a very long journey in feature movies for Hudson Production. Kudos to everyone involved with this project, you get a general feel that both the cast and crew really had a blast putting this project together. Everything from SFX, to the movie's score and acting, this is one movie that is hard to top."
3,Cool Zombie Sequences,"I thought the action scenes were great, and the zombie attack scenes were also scary and gory, but I did not really dig it for the most part. I'll give it another watch though. I really liked that it had no women in it. Now that IS a plus."
1,WHO KNOWS,"...I couldn't watch any more of this ridiculous shlocker after the first ten minutes. The acting goes beyond awful.....so if it's good, I'll never know!!!"
5,Perfect,"Perfect replacement for my krups espresso machine. Does not come with a lid, so be aware, if you need a lid as well, find another carafe. My husband accidentally bumped the old one and cracked it, so we had lid."
2,melitta carafe replacement,"I ordered this to replace my melitta carafe along with the top as recommended. the top came two weeks earlier than the carafe. When I went to put it on my espresso machine I found that the carafe will not fit with the top on! It is about 1/4 inch too high. I have to make the coffee without the top (while steam is escaping all around) then put the top on before I pour the espresso. what a dissapointment for the price, to have something that doesn't fit."
3,Krups 4 cup carafe minus lid,"apparently, the world no longer values the need to acquire the replacement lid for said carafe..."
3,Replacement carafe,"I purchased this carafe to replace one for the Krups 1500 coffee/espresso machine which I received for Christmas. I believe it will work, but the handle is attached with a screw which looks like it requires a star shaped screwdriver. I cannot find a screwdriver with a long enough shaft to fit in the handle and undo the band to replace it with the handle and lid which was on the original carafe. Will have to cut off the handle, I believe."
1,Why I'm buying another espresson carafe,I just bought the Krups espresso machine at costco yesterday and the carafe breaks on me. Its super fragile but i don't have a choice but to replace it. The machine sucks and its kind of dangerous. If i could return this machine and blow 600 dollars on a seaco automatic espresso machine...i would.
3,Old lid doesn't fit new carafe,"We're a bit perplexed. We ordered this replacement once before and found the lid to fit perfectly. This time, we ordered two replacement carafes and our old lid doesn't fit either one. Not sure if Krups has made a running production change or what. Bottom line: don't break your carafes as often as we do!"
4,"Much Better Than ""Cheaper"" Carafe","We have now bought both the Krups brand and the cheaper models available.Four Star rating because of price, much higher than the ""off brands"".Quality is much better than the cheaper ones available. The glass is thicker and much more resistant to breakage."
5,Great book of Short Stories about the world of the Company and her Fantasy novels,"I consider Kage Baker one of the SF&F greats, her three fantasy novels have been compared favorably to the Lord of the Rings, and The Hobbit. So having written great novels you have to find places for the little stories that derive from the novels, and that is a big part of this volume. Oh and there is indeed a Company story in this volume. (See if you can pick it out.)"
4,Liked it so much I'm reordering,It helps a lot with my dog when she pulls. Small correction. Lost it somewhere and ordering again I liked it that much. My dog is 50 pound medium 2 year old. Thanks.
5,Nice collar!,"I don't like to keep any kind of collar on my dogs in the house, but sometimes especially with more than one dog you just need something to grab ahold of (breaking up squabbles, etc). These are sturdy, yet soft and light enough that the dogs don't seem to know they're wearing a collar. LOVE them!"
1,Useless,"This filter is useless. I am extremely happy with the Krups KM7000 coffee maker now that I figured out what the culprit was (this filter). The filter does a terrible job of filtering out what I will call ""coffee-mud"". I was always getting a thick residue in the bottom of the pot and unless I made extra and carefully poured, I'd end up with this gunk in my cup. I still use the filter, but I use it with a traditional paper filter. Not sure if there is a need for this filter at all since I'm using a paper filter, but I like to think I'm getting some use for my $10."
3,not like old gold tone filters,"This filter is much lighter and pliable than the gold tone Krups filters i have purchased in the past. It also doesn't fit well in the Krups coffee machine (FMF5) that i bought it for. It should fit in smoothly, instead, i have to cram it in to get it past the little knobs on each side where the handle meets the filter. I would much rather it fit easier.Other than that, it cleans up well and dries fast."
1,Stick with paper,We thought this would save money on buying filters. In theory it should however it allows a fairley large quanity of grounds and sediment through. We are back to using paper.
2,Fine if you don't mind sludge,The filter is fine if you don't mind sludge in your cup and carafe and the cleaning process. A paper filter or even a paper towel does a better job.
3,Great Condition - Does not fit the 10 Cup Coffee Maker,This coffee filter came in great condition and on time from the seller. Unfortunately it does not fit the 10 cup stainless steel Krups Coffee maker. The sides of the filter are completely round instead of flat on the sides of the lip of the filter that doesn't have the mesh. Therefore it didn't fit down into the coffee maker like it should. I believe it was designed for a different Krups Coffee maker instead.
1,krups 049,"This filter does not fit the 12-cup Krups Aroma Control coffee maker I purchased. Also, despite an independent rating I read in Cooks magazine, I'm not that impressed with the coffeemaker itself. The carafe doesn't keep the coffee any hotter than Mr. Coffee and the brew tastes the same to me."
2,Went back to a paper filter.,"I bought this filter to conserve paper. However, this filter does not do a good job filtering out small particles of ground coffee. I decided to move back to a #4 paper filter."
1,Very poor quality.,"This filter was purchased to use with our news Krups coffeemaker. I was skeptical from the beginning, as the basket was flimsy compared to our older Krups filter. The filter cracked after two weeks. I would not recommend."
1,I do not recommend This coffee filter,It fell apart the second time that I use it. The gold screen separated from the frame. I now use my filters from my old Coffee maker.
5,Saves money on paper filters,"This filter does everything a normal paper filter does, but you simply clean it and reuse it. With the amount of coffee we drink in my home, it didn't take long for the savings to take affect. I'm not sure how long this is supposed to last, it would be even better if the gold filter was replaceable."
4,does what it says,The Krups filter does just what it says it will do. Hold the coffee while it brews without a paper filter.
3,"Not too bad, but others are better","We bought this with our Krups coffee pot and well, after TWO of those that exploded, we gave up. However, this filter was going strong for quite some time and it was used on a daily basis. It does allow some of the coffee to filter through thus causing sludge on the bottom of the pot. Other than that, I love not having to buy those paper filters! I've run mine through the dishwasher for years without any difficulties."
2,"Not easy to clean, more powder in coffee","I bought it because the paper filter often was folded due to careless sliding in, that causes coffee powder to fall into water. I admit I was careless, so I thought this will solve my problem. First, it is taking more work to wash it, while I can just toss the paper filter. Second, it is not fine enough and too much coffer powder fall into the drink."
1,Does not fit.,"This is not the right filter for the Krupps XP1500. I had to modify the filter to fit. I made it fit after 2 hours of carefull grinding. It works now, but just barely. I would not recommend it."
3,Good for a cone filter machine,I have a Krups KM9008 coffee maker. Why this keeps showing up as a recommended addition for this coffee maker I don't know. The KM9008 uses a cupcake style filter not a cone filter. Either Amazon or Krups needs to figure out the disconnect and get it right on the recommended additions for this coffee maker. Very annoying.
4,Get the right filter!,This is the filter that fits the Krups FME2-14 12 cup coffee maker. It does not say this and the other filter description states that it fits all Krups makers. This is false information.
2,There Are Better Ones Out There,"I have been using gold coffee filters for years for all my coffeemakers, however I was very disappointed with this one by Krups. I love my Krups Aroma Control with stainless steel carafe, but the Swiss Gold filter is far superior to the Krups 049. You can find the Swiss Gold brand all over the web -- the #4 is the same size as the Krups 049.A good gold filter will give you the best coffee because it allows the coffee's oils to brew into the pot."
1,Watch out it may not fit,"July 2011 I bought a Krupps XP1500 coffee maker. The literature said use a #4 paper filter but my wife wanted a gold mesh one. I ordered the Krupps 049-33 Gold Tone Filter and it doesn't fit. On the Krupps 049-33 box are listed many coffee makers it does fit but the XP1500 is not one of them. By phone, Krupps told me the Gold Filter I need is a #52 but Krupps didn't make it any more and that I should use paper filters. The #52 is availabe on-line but I think it is for #2 paper filters. This isn't rocket science so how hard can it be for Krupps to provide proper documentation and products?"
3,Nice concept - but don't buy if...,"I liked the idea of the gold filter. No waste of paper(is it reusable)and has a handy handle to remove unit even while hot, but what I have found from using it, and it seems to only be with freshly ground coffee (using a krups grinder), you get a VERY bitter taste with it. I cleaned/soaked the gold filter and it did not change. Even when I changed coffees and the way it was ground, it was still there. I would suggest anyone who uses standard outta the bag ground coffee to use it, but be warned if you grind your own."
2,The Best? Hardly.,"There's so significant material here, but it's also available in over 2 dozen other bargain bin repackagings. If you buy these songs, make sure you get them cheap."
1,Summer Crossing,"No wonder Truman Capote didn't want this book published. It's disjointed and rambling, with no clear characterization. Cross it off your list."
4,A New-Old Novella Comes to Light,"This is a work that dives into life with an ability that is breath-taking. Here is the description of a cat house at the Central Park Zoo. ""The cat house of a zoo has an ornery smell, an air prowled by sleep, mangy with old breath and dead desires...At feeding time a cat house turns into a thunderous jungle, for the attendant, passing with blood-dyed hands among the cages, is sometimes slow, and his wards, jealous of one who has been fed first, scream down the roof, rattle the steel with roars of longing."" The description of a panther and leopard reminds one of Rilke. ""Somehow the leopard does not suffer, nor the panther: their swagger makes distinct claims upon the pulse...."" And here is a character perfectly depicted, wavering: ""for it was impossible to feel, as Grady certainly didn't, threatened by or jealous of her."" Try writing a sentence like that at age nineteen."
3,It has that Capote spark,"This is a very early effort by Capote, and it wasn't published in his lifetime so it should be regarded as unfinished, but you can see hints of his future greatness in his elegant use of language, his ability to evoke a world, and his love of the shocking moment. The plot is very simple: Grady, the 17 year old daughter of a wealthy Park Avenue family, stays in New York while her parents spend the summer in Europe. She's fallen in love with a parking attendant in a city garage and wants to spend the summer enjoying her secret love. But she hasn't thought through the consequences of a liaison with someone from another social class. Events begin to spiral out of control...The book is short, a novella really, and well worth reading if you are a Capote fan, although it certainly doesn't compare with his mature work."
4,Pride and Joy,This is a fantastic gospel album I bought for my wife. Every track is really awesome. Charlie Pride is one of her favorite artist.
4,Priide & Joy - A Must Have,A excellent recording. Charley never disappoints. I would recommend this album as he does such a good job of some of these favourite songs.
3,Charlie Pride CD,"I ordered two copies of the same CD. Shorting after beginning use of one CD, it began to skip and is know longer usable. The other one seems to be okay."
4,Excellent,"A first rate telling of the Entebbe operations. Lack of moviemaking polish is evidence, but not missed much."
1,Operation Thunderbolt dvd,"This dvd does not work in my dvd player. It is in Hebrew, which I knew, but it seems not to be for standard American dvd players. So, it was a waste. I'm disappointed and frustrated that the seller did not explain this when selling it."
5,hill street blues,"one of the best television shows ever, was so glad that I could download it on to my kindle to watch again"
5,great peice of tv history,brings back memories it was me and my wifes favourite program I enjoy it a lot.
2,Hill Street Blues - Season 1,Hill Street Blues - Season 1The Spanish language does not work and if it that it is they should specify that it is Latin
4,Hill Street Blues-Season 1,"I am one of the few people who had never watched this show when it was broadcast. However, I bought it for a friend, a big fan of the show who, after watching the entire season, sent it back to me to watch for myself. While the hair and clothing styles are a bit dated, the story lines and show itself hold up even today. Though the SD discs are two sided and the audio is in mono, the quality of the video itself was pretty darn good for such an old series. I felt like the blacks were a bit too crushed eliminating much detail but other than that, and especially if you are or were a fan, the series and DVD holds up. There's no question that this series spurned the development of the fantastic NYPD Blues and is the godfather of many similar shows. My friends birthday is coming up and so will probably buy him season 2. Then I will get to watch it when he is done."
3,Hill Street Blues - Sesason 1,"The set came with 3 CDs. There are 6 episodes on Disc 1 & 2 and 5 on Disc 3. I could only access 4 episodes on each of the 3 discs. The selection menu did not include the last 2. I returned the set and received a new set very promptly, but it was still the same. I have not returned this as I am afraid a replacement would be the same. I would appreciate a tech looking at this set and telling me if there is a way to view all episodes."
4,Missing Episodes,"Although the quality of the DVD is excellent, there were 2 episodes missing on my copy and also on the replacement copy which Amazon was very quick to send me. I am now in the process of returning both copies, just waiting for the mailing label. This show is one of the best police proocedurals ever filmed. The feel is very realistic, even with the few over the top characters (Belker the Biter comes to mind). One of Bocho's best."
3,Oh come on!,"Hill Street Blues, for me, was the best TV drama series ever. I'm glad it has finally come out on DVD but I was very disappointed to see them do it on the cheap with double sided discs.That's why it gets 3 stars. I'm reviewing the presentation of the show on DVD. Not the content, which is way above 5 stars."
4,Old School Cop drama,Long before Law and Orders and NYPD Blues there was this show in the early 80's. Bought this as a present for my Dad as he watched it more than I did
1,episodes missing,The first plot arc includes investigation of cop who made a bad decision and then tried too late to amend it. The episodes completing this arc were not on the disc. Ever tried to contact manufacturers to replace faulty discs? Buyer beware.
1,Laughed all the way through it!!,"Yes, I laughed all the way thru it...but wait, it wasn't supposed to be a comedy. Very disappointing. In collecting many old TV shows, I thought maybe I was missing something. I never watched Hill Street at the time and now I know why. I had heard so much and read all the great reviews and was expecting a great police drama with maybe a few quirky characters, but hey... the whole thing is full of quirky, no...silly characters. I bought both seasons one and two, but could only stand watching about fifteen minutes of episode one and gave up. If I want want silly baloney I'll watch all my old Andy Griffith shows. For just straight laughs give me Barney Miller and Rockford for good drama with a few laughs thrown in."
3,A bit weathered with time...,"I can remember in High-school being acquaintances with a fellow named Jeff Swan, who's advice to me, when signing my yearbook, was: turn your damn watch around, and don't forget to watch Hill Street Blues. Well, I still wear my watch turned to the inside, but I didn't forget his second piece of sage advice.Hill Street Blues was one of my favorite shows in the early 80's. I loved it! Its funny, because I remember it being ""so violent"" and exciting. Really a great show!Well, I watched this DVD set, and I have to say I was a bit disappointed. It didn't live up to my memories of the show. In fact, I can say I was a bit disappointed.I will give it 4 stars, as it is a well written show, and has some good plotlines. But overall, not my favorite DVD set.MC White said: Just a'iiight."
5,Can't wait for the rest of the seasons to come out!,"I've waited many years for this series to come out. We've watched all of these episodes (season 1) several times. It was like being home again. I realise they have been rerunning the series on TVLand, but I work during the day. This is much more convenient for me."
5,Geez it took them long enough!,One of the best shows ever produced. I hope they do every season as I really want to own the whole show. it's a benchmark for great drama and well written characters.
5,THE WAITING IS OVER,"I have every episode of HILL ST on tape, and was about buy a DVD recorder to transfer my grainy 20 year old VHS tapes to disc when the alert came in from Amazon... Thank God! The greatest TV show ever, in my book, filled with laughter, and pathos, never afraid to take on difficult situations, this was one of the first shows that allowed characters to have 'issues' as well as normal lives. And the comedy alone puts many 'sitcoms' to shame. Remember Captain Freedom? The scene with Mick Belker in the back yard of the scam saloon is so beautifully done. And Howard's 'suicide', the alligator in the sewers, JD 'shooting' Neal Washington, Bobby Hill winning the lottery.... so many great stories. An absolute masterpiece, with fabulous performances from everybody, even the smallest characters played great roles. Just wonderful. Veronica Hamel, if you ever read this - I absolutely love you!!!!"
2,It's always CowBOYs...,Do we really need another kids book about boys getting to become working cowboys? Why would girls want to read this?
2,ok,This product was used for sure. The corners were taped back together and the majority of the book is highlighted on every line.
2,geb,Having bought the pear shaped earrings I thought this pendant would be a great complement to it but was disapponinted with the size of the stone as it was much smaller than presented.
5,"The Stegners, Mary and Wallace","Since I think Wallace Stegner is an all time great writer, I naturally was interested to see his selections of best and favorite short stories. They did not disappoint!Great writers, little known works and intriguing discoveries to those who pursue these wonderful tidbits.And it is a challenge to have a beginning, middle and ending for a brief work. These are sucessful and tightly packed.Enjoy"
5,EXECELLENT LEARNING TOOK.,This was an execellent learning tool to introduce my 9th grade homeschooler to great works in literature. After reading this book he started reading more of the classic novels.
1,Book was not what was represented,"This was a much older version(1983 printing) of what was pictured and was in bad shape - yellowed pages, warn cover, - not at all what I expected or paid for. Not worth it to return it (I will be out another $4 - 5)."
3,"Sorry, but in this one Gann falls short","I am an avid Gann fan. His books have generally given me so much pleasure and inspiration, I just have no words to tell. However, in this book, a work of fiction, I find his story just too much to accept. I suppose it is because he has always made the true life stories so immediately life like for me and his true adventures are simply so much more adventurous than just about any fictions I have ever read. His style is there, his devotion to his craft is there, and the work is certainly well colored and life-like,. It is just that for me, I simply felt let down for the content and the asking of the writer to believe a stretch too far. No one is perfect, and I would never think this book exposes any ""clay feet"". No one is perfect. This book is a testament to that maxim."
5,A riveting and choice read that shouldn't be missed,"A new life in a new land is rough, especially when it isn't so easy to be accepted. ""The Russians are Coming!"" is a story of six immigrants trying to find their way adapting from the Russian way of life to the American way of life. Over a year of life for these individuals are shown, and paint an accurate pictures of the triumphs and pitfalls that many immigrants face in their lives. ""The Russians Are Coming!"" is a riveting and choice read that shouldn't be missed."
2,The answering machine that never worked,"I really liked the phone, everything worked except the answering machine. I liked it so much I went through four of them. Two from amazon and two from another store. Uniden customer service was good but I was told it was a repair problem and need to be sent back to Uniden. After four tries I think its a manufacturing problem."
2,Cannot use Base with Headset!,"WARNING! You cannot use the corded telephone with a headset. I confirmed with UNIDEN support that this is the case. Overall the telephone is okay, but not being able to use it with a headset renders it useless for me. I wish I had purchased a different telephone."
3,its Good,i wud say i switched Panasonic to Uniden but some how i was not much immpressed but its good but range is very short
2,"No headset capaibility on base unit, good phone otherwise","I bought this phone to gain headset capability on a corded base while still having a cordless handset. I am returning the phone, as it does not allow the use of a headset on the corded base. Not only does the phone lack a 2.5mm jack or a second audio port, the base is incompatible with universal headset adapters (confirmed by Uniden customer service). It's too bad, beacuse the cordless phone audio quality is as good as I've heard."
4,product (if clean) is actually pretty nice,"What can I say? My daughter LOVES keys! Leave your keys around and she'll be sure to grab them. She takes whatever keys she can get her hands on and sticks them in whatever holes she can find (and thank goodness I put those safety outlet plugs in all our outlets)! She also LOVES Sesame Street characters so these keys were heaven-sent! The only issue I had was the CONDITION the keys arrived in. It looked to me like the seller had these keys for awhile sitting around collecting dust -- LOTS of dust. Also, the battery died soon after I received the item. I contacted the seller but I got no response. The keys aren't as realistic as other play keys available on the market but they're cute and distract kids for a little while."
1,Horrible,"Completely random, poor acting from decent actors, a story that really makes little to no sense. This is what this movie is all about. I can't really say much more, it was just plain bad."
4,Bullfighter,"Not a great movie, but single this one out if you like the out-of-ordinary which is done with superior acting and directing....what could have been an ordinary hackjob of a simple story is certainly way above anything you might see in the Saturday night multiplex. See if and you'll definitely be pleased and surprised."
1,'BULLFIGHTER'...WHY!?!,"When I heard about this film, and read about the awesome talent that was working on the project, I thought to myself, ""Gee, this sounds like a really good idea! You have a sweet cast with actors like Olivier Martinez and Michelle Forbes, cameos by writer/director Robert Rodriguez and Guillermo Del Toro, and a villain played by none other than Michael Parks! How can you go wrong with an all-star cast like this?"" The answer: Have an inexperienced newcomer like Rune Bendixen make your movie! This is a perfect example why anybody with a camera and a script can make a movie, and gives anybody who's ever wanted to make one the uptmost confidence that even you can do a better job. Thanks Rune!"
3,"Obviously an Expert, but awkward for online genealogy","Emily Anne Croom is an undisputed expert in the field of genealogy but this book is for intermediate to advanced researchers. Based on the premise that you will encounter brick walls in uncovering your ancestors, Croom attempts to give you ideas and strategies using proven techniques. She assumes you have read the basic books (including her own).Another unfortunate assumption is that she tailors her book for genealogists who are not utilizing one of the numerous software databases and therefore much of her text is spent with helpful hints about organizing your group family sheets and documents. I actually found the numerous ""sleuth"" quotes from Arthur Conan Doyle and Agatha Christie to be very distracting (and I'm a huge mystery fan at that!). Final thought, a good book for the non-computer using, intermediate genealogist."
4,Pretty good,This was a pretty good book. I love royalty books. This sheik wasn't as arrogant as some but the heroin was a little mousey. Overall it is a good book.
4,good book,"Not an eye - opening book, but had lots of information packed into a small book. Would recomend it for someone who wants to learn more about the sport. I would have liked more information about the workings of F1 engines and transmissions, but the other sections packed in a lot of informaton some of which I had no idea about (like the crash testing that is preformed)."
1,F1 Technology,Interesting book. Not quite up to the usual Autocourse standards. Biggest problem is that the technology race is so fast in F1 that the book was out of date as soon as it was published!
3,Technology of the F1 Car is amazing.....,"But it is hard to keep up with it in books. My first indication that this book wasn't going to be great was the picture of West McLaren's car on the cover. Much of the information presented is worth the read - even more so if you have some mechanical or engineering background - as well as some knowledge of technology itself (for example, I believe that McLaren? is moving to an OS written by Sun Microsystems)- but it is not a prerequisite as Nigel McKnight has written the book in a manner that should be understandable for all to enjoy. Before I read this book, I would read a book on suspension systems and traction control, chassis, and whatever you can find on engines - I say this because these are some of the components of the car controlled by technology and computers. Not only is keeping up with technology difficult - but most of what the teams do is proprietary and very, very, guarded secrets. All in all, I tip my ""Williams"" hat to Nigel McKnight."
5,GREAT!,"I love this book! All of Cathy Kelly's books give the point of view of a few different people and it keeps you so interested. The main characters this time were that of a well known family in a small town. Rose, the matriarch is just approaching her 40th wedding anniversary and has kept the fact that her husband unfaithful to herself for almost all of the 40 years. Her oldest daughter, Stella, is raising her young daughter on her own and is just falling in love for the first time since the birth of her daughter. Rose's middle daughter, Tara, is blissfully newly married, or so she thought. Tara is struggling through her whirlwind marriage and learning her husband has a few secrets of his own. And Rose's poor youngest daughter, Holly, has a lack of self confidence all stemming from Rose's own problems when Holly was a baby.It's such a good book that takes you into the minds of each of the woman and they gain control of their lives."
5,Wonderful modern family drama,"I haven't even finished the book yet but I'm so engrossed in the stories of these four women! I find it so believable and relatable that these women (3 sisters and mother) all see each other's lives as charmed when in fact they all have their own problems. It takes place in Ireland but could just as easily have taken place in my hometown! These women band together to help each other through divorces, single motherhood, adultery, alcoholism, and unrequited love. Their stories are touching and the characters are well-developed. I love Maeve Binchy and I feel this writer is on par with her."
1,Couldn't get in to it,"I found it very hard to get into this book and consequently I havn't managed to finish it. Usually I can keep pushing through books but not this one. Its boring and dull has no life the characters are dull. If those of you who have managed to get through this book and have enjoyed it, good for you and well done"
3,Just Between Us,"The main characters in this book are grandmother Rose, glamorous and well known, spends her days with charity work. She is married to Hugh, wealthy with a good career. This book is about the lead up to their 40th wedding anniversary.Rose and Hugh have 3 daughters. Stella is the oldest, is a single mum and works as a solicitor. The second daughter Tara is a script writer, married to a `Brad Pitt Lookalike' and the youngest, and probably most likeable Holly is searching for love and works in a department store. Holly not being very confident doesn't realise how beautiful she is.This book was okay but not as enjoyable as some of Kelly's other books."
2,Beware--no lid,"The replacement drip coffee carafe for the Krups Duomo does not come with a replacement lid. Most replacements do, so in this case, don't throw away the old lid."
4,Solid replacement but no lid....,The pot itself is the same one that the coffee maker came with so I was very satisfied with that aspect. I knew prior to buying (by reading the other reviews) that the item DOES NOT COME WITH THE LID which you need. Luckily I had my old lid still but really who does that...sell the replacement in two parts? Apparently Krups does. Because of this once my coffee pot bites the dust I will never buy another Krups product again. Both because of the pot and lid being sold as separate items and because there is no mention of this essential bit of info in the description. Thank God for the reviewers.
3,I'm a knucklehead!!,"I wrongly purchased this carafe, insofar as I have a Braun coffeemaker at my office -- I ordeed it from home. I am using it, anyway, and it works fine. I suspect it does fine with a Krups maker as well. I have just one complaint: it has no numbers on the side, indicating how much water is in the carafe. I like to know how much water I am pouring into the machine BEFORE I pour it in."
1,Disapointed,"I was very disapointed to find out that after spending over [$$$]for my Krups coffee maker, when it came time to buy a replacement carafe it comes with no lid. ([$$$]later) After spending the additional [$$$]I still can't use my coffee maker."
3,Replacement coffee carafe review,The item was shipped promptly and packed well. The only problem was that we expected it to have a top included and that had to be bought separately.
3,It does the job. What do you want from a carafe?,"All I have to say is if your Krups carafe breaks, save the plastic lid. It's not included with the replacement carafe."
1,Go with a different brand!,No lid!!! Rather spend the money on a brand that thinks before selling 1/2 of a replacement piece.
5,Entheogens: Professional Listing,"""Gateway to Inner Space"" has been selected for listing in ""Religion and Psychoactive Sacraments: An Entheogen Chrestomathy."" http://www.csp.org/chrestomathy"
3,"Outdated for today's market, but some info still VERY valuable","Since this is geared towards transforming troublesome resumes, if you drop the info here and samples into an updated format, sans objective and references available, for example, then there are still some valuable nuggets to be found for those difficult and unusual work histories, that seem to be more commonplace today in light of rampant layoffs, downsizing, and necessity to job-hop."
3,Thorough but dated,"The title of the book led me to believe that this book would encompass the entire ""conquering"" family of Normandy as they became the rulers of England. However, I was disappointed that the actual conquest was bypassed and the book opens with introduction of the first Plantagenets and not with William the Conqueror as I incorrectly assumed from the title. The book is very thorough where the author choses to be. For example, he can hit a few highlights of history and move the story along very rapidly and then suddenly spend page after page on one segment of one chapter of one person's life. I know I bought the book used, but the original publication date of 1949 and the republication in 1964 seemed obvious in the authors style and tone. I think the book is very informative, and if you are interested in the Plantagenets, it is something you'd enjoy. Just be aware of the ""late"" start of the book. The actual Conquest is over before this book begins."
4,Plain label,"If you don't mind a plain book without embellishment where the content is more important than the appearance, this is the kind of book for you."
5,Glad I can get these on Amazon,"I've had difficulties in getting the right filters elsewhere, and it is nice to know they are available online. They are precisely what I needed."
5,charcoal filters,There's nothing extraordinary about the filters except that they were designed to filter tap water used to make coffee. They definitely work and make the coffee taste great.
3,Coffee maker filters,"These filters for my coffee maker work fine. I was surprized that a piece of filter paper wrapped around some activated charcoal was so expensuve.However, I understand that maintainence materials for a quality product such as this coffee maker,are likely to be pricey."
3,Taste Test,"I can't tell the difference in the coffee, but my wife can. I guess the filters work. The price isn't bad - better than the only local competition I found and certainly more convenient."
3,Need different filter or will this one work?,"Where are the filters for a model #458, these are more of a straight line filter rather than having a curve to them?\"
5,Krups 594-00 Charcoal Water Filter,"Excellent service by seller. The product was shipped promptly with no problems. The filters (two in package) are the original accessory as manufactured by or for Krups (not an aftermarket substitute), so no review on the filter itself is intended."
5,Promotes Culture of Free-thinking (Emotional Context) and Well-formed Thoughts,"Rational Presentation---------------------Compared to Serway's Text, Giancoli's presentation is a model of rationality. For example, the first 4 chapters are:Chapter 1 Introduction Measurement, EstimatingChapter 2 Describing Motion: Kinematics in One DimensionChapter 3 Kinematics in Two Dimensions; VectorsChapter 4 Dynamics: Newton's Laws of MotionThe order here demonstrates a rational, ordered thought. First, Motion in One Dimesion precedes the chapter on Vectors, unlike in Serway's text. Second, unlike in Serway's text Vectors and Two Dimensions are one chapter not 2.Good Concept Integration------------------------For example, the introduction of Coulomb's law takes advantage of the opportunity to mention that additional electromagnetic forces exist when charges are in motion."
4,Helpful reference,I started using this book after college days to review some physics topics now and then. It is a complete and helpful reference covering the very broad field of physics. The large quantity of topics are logically structured which becomes apparent when one reads the table of contents.
3,NO theory but lots of problem solving,"The mechanics part is excellent, but the theory vanishes as you reach the electricity and magnetism part. If you're not a physics major, just want to go through the course as fast as you can, and want to get a good grade, this book might work for you becasue it does lots of problem solving and simple ""plug and chugs.""But if you're a physics or math or science major, the book is pretty boring because you already know how to plug in numbers into equations--and that's all the book does!I thought the mechanics part was pretty good, but the electomagnetic part just had bunch of equations without enough explanation as to what they mean. I got an ""A"" both semesters but didn't learn anything the second semester. I heard the third semester was pretty easy.Overall, if you can find a good teacher who covers lots of theory, the book would probably work perfect, but if you want to study on your own, then you won't learn anything."
1,awful textbook for those that are starting out.,"I have had to use this textbook for two straight years, and my opinion of Giancoli's textbook still hasn't changed: it is just plain awful.While most math and science books will take the time to logically explain how to solve problems, this book skips over many steps. In some aspects, it is almost illogical because the authors assume so much.Also, the book just doesn't give an adequate discussion of most physical concepts. In many cases, a huge chunk of a major concept will be hidden in an example problem.For those who have studied physics before, this may be a good book for you. It contains a nice ""review"" (though inadequate for first year students) of most physics concepts, and contains a nice selection of problems. For all other students, stay away from this one."
3,"A Brooding, Dark Bloodstorm event horizon...","This 2nd novel of three started out just like the 1st - excellent and dark fantasy that hinted to greater things to come - but didn't for me.Just like the 1st novel, the first half of the 2nd volume seems to be written by one of the authors, while the other half is written by the other. And it seems, whomever wrote the two first halves of both novels - is the better writer. I liked the fist halves of both novels way better than the latter halves.Still, all in all, both novels are thrill rides, filled with dark mayhem and fantasy-filled adventure. I just purchased the 3rd volume. These are two of the better fantasy Warhammer novels out there. Graham McNeil's Guardians of the Forest is thus far the best in the fantasy Warhammer series. Check both of these series out.All three cover artworks are excellent. I wish Malus's nauglir beast would have been in this story more."
4,Feel good shoes,These shoes wear well and feel great. I am a large person and on my feet a lot during the day. These shoes help reduce the leg and foot pain that such activity causes. Recommended.
4,THE INVISIBLE WOMAN (1940),"(Comedy/Science Fiction, 1 hr 12 min, Black & White)DIRECTOR: A. Edward SutherlandCAST: Virginia Bruce (As: Kitty Carroll), John Barrymore (As: Professor Gibbs), Charles Ruggles, Maria Montez (As: Marie)COMMENTS: In the continuation of Universal's ""Invisible"" series, Barrymore stars as a crazy professor who discovers the secret of invisibility.Bruce plays the model who becomes the subject of his scientific experiment and soon finds herself transparent. She gets involved with a wacky group of bandits who try to steal the machine for their own illegal use.Bruce sets out on her own, with attempts at romance with John Howard, the man who financed the invention, and at evening the score with her former employer. The typical ""invisible"" special effects are employed, though this time with a little more humor. The film earned an Oscar nomination for Best Special Effects.Maria Montez appears in a scene between a group of models, she only said one line."
3,for a fun afternoon!,"In a wonderful twist to the serial movies ""Invisible man"" series we have a female heroine, way ahead of its time and a real treat. You can watch all the ""Invisible"" movies on a Sunday afternoon one after the other and its quite a show. Don't forget the popcorn!"
4,A very cute.......,.....& witty drama/comedy. It's good for laughs and just plain fun/relaxation. My wife and I really had a goofy/fun evening watching it.
2,Not worth buying,"The concept is interesting; the execution is remarkably poor. Childish and overblown prose, combined with cliched dialogue, makes Brothers diffcult enough to read. When that's combined with a ridiculous story, with improbable coincidences and dangling plot threads, it's hard not to laugh outright as you're reading. I also found the theme of having the brother(Tan) who was raised in luxury also being the hero who could do no wrong a little annoying. So it's not possible for someone raised in poverty(Shento) to be a decent man? ALL of the characters were shallow caricatures, however, and I guess it's easier to make it extremely clear who's good and who's bad. Anyway, I did finish the whole mess, so Da Chen deserves that much credit. Pick it up at a library if you really must read a novel set in modern China."
5,"Enthralling, loved it","I admit to being a bit deficient in the category of Chinese-inspired literature; however, this book pulled me in from the very beginning and I loved each of the characters. The epic plot is what makes the story worth writing - it does not in the least make it sophomoric or juvenile. I had to weigh in - the bad reviews on this one are completely unwarranted. I'm taking it to my Book Club this week."
5,Give it a chance!,"Great book chosen for our book club this month! Set amidst the Chinese Cultural Revolution, this story of two brothers born of the same father- one illegitimate, begins the story that culminates at the end with a family and country bitterly divided. Shocking, touching and thought-provoking, this was a very well written novel, even more so, one with a message to be learned.I'm surprised that it got so many so-so and negative reviews! While I agree that some of what happened was far-fetched and maybe not all history was correct 100%, I thought this was one of the better novels I've read in the last year. Certainly one that I won't forget- and that to me, is a telling tidbit of how much I invested in & enjoyed this book. I'd definitely recommend it to a friend. Give it a chance!"
5,Loved this book,This is a wonderful novel that kept me on edge the entire time. It's a well-written facinating story by an author who clealy understands how to tell a story.
1,It is too juvenile a work!,"The author has a rabid dislike of the Chinese government, and this book is his mechanism for trying to get that point actross. On the way he overstates and exaggerates the issues and problems associated with China, and his attitude is so strong and so transparent, that the story loses credibility.The story itself is sophmoric, relying on chance meetings, people being saved from catastopohe akin to Marlowe's Dr. Faustus, where, if not everything, most things happen for the better. Good guys get rewarded and the bad guys get their come-uppance.Overall, there may be some enlightment in this book on Chinese society before the 1980s but that is not enough of a reason to recommend the book. It is too juvenile a work."
2,High school creative writing project.,"This book has some rather good writing but it's spotty and thin and easily overlooked in the ridiculous story and over reaching prose. The writer shamelessly makes the same two or three characters into extremes of everything - if the one character is intellectual, he has to come first in China,when he is rich, he has to be richer than anyone else, if he's in love with a poet, she's no.1 in the country.The other character is of course desperately in love with the same woman and is ridiculously evil..but the author hastens to give us reasons why the one became evil, and keeps a worshipful tone about the heroine throughout, making me feel this was written by a very young writer. I can't imagine taking this seriously enough even to comment on the authenticity of the period, representation of the Govt. etc. The cover art is the best part. (Sorry - I feel I just slammed a young teen's first writing effort)."
2,"good start, disappointing finish","This book started well. Unfortunately, the writing quickly became hackneyed boilerplate and the plot no better than a Chinese soap opera. Stick to his non-fiction works."
1,Didn't last.,We have purchased many products for our new puppy. This one didn't last even 10 minutes before he started tearing pieces off it.
3,"Classic, cheesy B movie","As only the B&W classic drive-in movies could do, or a Mystery Science Theater 3000 movie could do, this is the classic, cheesy,and fun B movie. Deadly Species is funny and dopey and almost good. It's got all the elements.....bad sound, bad music, gratutious nude scenes with pretty girls, some blood and gore, and of course foam-rubber customed men running around killing people. It won't be up for any awards but Deadly Species is a fun movie to sit around and make fun of on a Saturday night with some friends, some chips and beer."
2,RETURN OF THE RUBBER SUITS,"You'd think in a movie made in 2000, you wouldnt expect to see monsters in rubber suits. WRONG! That's only one of the many ingredients in this almost campy horror flick. DEADLY SPECIES gives us the usual billionaire business man out on a mysterious expedition. A kindly professor, his wife and several of his ""best"" students, who all act like prepubescent idiots. Only the studly bodyguard for the businessman exudes any kind of presence, and his role is certainly not challenging. A muddled plot, bad pacing and just all around foolishness make DEADLY SPECIES a rental on an All Night Bad Movie Fest."
2,B Movie Dreams,"""Deadly Species"" was made for one reason, to make money off the straight to video market. It contains every cliche in the book. I also wondered where the originality of B movie filmmakers went? ""Deadly Species"" is no where near my type of film, but I always give credit where credit is due, at least the filmmakers created a movie that's available to public. They completed what they set off to do, even if it involved a native tribe, naked women, rubber guns, bad acting and mutant gators."

4,Guitar Boogie,"This collection has some Yardbirds from the Clapton era that are on many Clapton and Yardbirds releases, the Mayall singles are nice filler, but the bulk of the CD is from an early 70's Pickwick discount lp called Guitar Boogie featuring Mickie Most's studio band the Immediate Allstars.These instrumental tracks were originally compiled from the UK released series of History of the British Blues lps from the late 60's.Is it essential listening?No, but it is an interesting collection of what Eric was doing before The Cream, not too mention Beck before Jeff Beck Group and Page before his Yardbirds gig.4 Stars for being a collection of unremastered ""out take"" quality original analog recordings."
1,bleh,"ok, the cd is incredibly horrible, but before you blow them off, see them live!!!!!!!!!!!!!! they have the most awesome live shows, just trust me on this"
4,Indispensable,"I've owned this cookbook for about 8 yrs. The recipes for the most part require ingredients that can readily be found in most people's cupboard on a typical day. What I really like about this cook book is that except for a few exceptions...every recipe is deeeeeeelicious!! Here are some of the exceptional ones...Chicken Enchilada Casserole, Cheddar Noodle Casserole, Turkey Tortilla Bake, Broccoli Souffle Bake & My Favorite Quiche. Even the kids will eat these..cause the they don't actually see the veggies & healthy stuff inside...they see cheese on top and believe it's yummy to eat..I recommend this cook book for any person who's rushed for time and rarely has a bunch of gourmet ingredients in the house."
3,Quck and easy BUT...,"Yes this book has recipes that are quick and easy, I will give it that. It also has basic ingredients that can be found in everyone's kitchens. My major problem with this book is that it doesn't list the nutritional information for each recipe. So if you are trying to watch your waistline or sodium intake this book is not for you. It is definitely a book full of comfort food that your Grandmother uses to make!"
5,good book,This is a very good baby record. It can make the record of your baby and the photo is very warm and cute.
3,Purely pictures. Nothing technical about the Viper.,"If you're looking for lots of pictures of F-16's around the world, this is your book. If you want technical stuff, look somewhere else."
5,"A must for ""Jaws"" fans and completists","A wonderfully original concept for movie posters. Glad they chose ""Jaws"" as one of the few films to honor with this toy idea.Bought two - one for me and one as a gift.Item not same size as original one-sheet, but smaller size keeps product affordable.Happy with purchase and very happy with vendor's speed of delivery."
2,Fragile,"Works wellCarafe too fragile, all ready need to replace.Can't find replacement that is in stock.So either I wait 3-5 weeks or buy a whole new maker!Don't buy!!!!!!!!!!!!Buy something more common so parts are aval"
2,Too fragile and too expensive,The carafe pours well but broke within one month after purchase. It costs almost as much to replace the carafe as to buy a new coffee maker. No thanks.
3,"attractive, works, but difficult to clean","this carafe is attractive and obviously does the job of holding coffee well. However, the top of the carafe is very difficult to remove, which presents a serious problem because the carafe cannot be cleaned unless the top is separated from the carafe. I have had to replace two of these carafes because the very small plastic pieces that hold the top to the carafe broke when I was trying to remove the top for cleaning."
2,hard to find replacement carafe,I like the look of the Krups carafe but it slipped right out of the coffee maker and broke- now I can not find a replacement at any local stores.I'm also having a hard time finding the water filter.Aside from that I liked the coffemaker- when it was whole.
2,"Fine coffeemaker, but terrible carafe!","I'm about to buy my third carafe in a year. This is a great coffeemaker, works well and looks nice on the counter but the carafes are so fragile it seems like it breaks if I give it a hard look! At least they are cheaper here than most other places."
2,Krups Crystal Arome Replacement Carafe,"Sorry to say that I have to agree with everyone else. It's a great looking machine, coffee was good, but........The carafe broke just 3 months after I bought it. I spent another 3 months trying to track down a replacement carafe. The carafes are [high priced], paper thin and just about impossible to find!Very disappointing and frustrating."
1,LESSOR OF TO EVILS,"I paid 50 bucks for the Krups coffer maker, which you can now get for 30 bucks. However the Carafe still cost 25 bucks to replace - when it breaks. And yes, your cute little round pot will break with the slightest pressure. Speaking of, I'm under pressure to replace the Carafe since the pot (aka: Brittle Carafe) looks so darn cool. Hum. Looks or quality? I'm going back to quality. I learned my lesson. Hope you know better"
2,On the prowl for a carafe,"I'm also looking for a replacement carafe. I admit the machine looks nice and works great. The carafe, though, is very fragile and broke while I was washing it. Trying to order a replacement is a lesson in futility. Assuming I do get a replacement and if it does break again, I'll probably just get a new machine. Not worth the trouble and wait for the replacement."
4,Good Replacement Parts,"I have had the Krups Crystal Arome #398 for almost 8 years now and the original carafe just broke. This replacement fits the coffee maker just fine, but the ""white"" color is a little off from the original one. They did make some improvements to the lid design, which is more sturdy than the original. Overall, I am very pleased with this item."
5,From the HVRN Corporation - Excellent Book,"We found Tristan Rimbaud's ""Through Psychic Eyes"" an excellent read. We, as well as many of our listeners, found this book inspiring and many of listeners with the same types of psychic gifts could relate to the trials and journeys Tristan has endured in his life. We have had him as a guest on our show on more than one occasion and we have found that he is truly what he claims to be- a very gifted psychic."
3,"functional, but a little hard to grasp and turn",item works as designed. it is difficult to turn on and off because there is no handle or such.
5,"Great product, should be standard","Great product, no more puddles surrounding my bag when I go to pick it up. Plain and simple, this should be standard!"
3,Great Case with a couple warnings,"This is a great looking very functional case for the iphone 3G. It works as advertised. The belt clip is 360 and never comes off your belt . The case is very well made and the stitching looks like it won't come out... I've had a lot of cases and this one is one that I will use and keep..2 issues however. If you are not careful the phone could slip out of the case which is what happened to me.. I fixed this by affixing male and female velcro to the phone and the case and that has solved the problem...The second issue is the clip attachment to the case.. The attachment screws onto the back of the case and then attaches to your belt clip.. I found that you need to check the tightness of the attachment because through use, it manages to loosen and then finally comes out... So I check it every now and then and adjust it as needed."
4,Good eatin',Easy recipes that are what real people eat. I really enjoy the beginning of the book where she talks about the joy in serving her family. This would be a good cookbook for newlyweds or new parents. :)
3,"Meerkat Manor, or Is It?",This version of Meerkat Manor has no menu. Having no menu means you have to forward through six episodes to get to the seventh. Extremely inconvenient. Otherwise fine...
2,not all the episodes,"Love This Show... First let me say that. Then let me say, this is an incomplete set. Would have been fine except that the end of one just leaves you hanging as to weather Flower will kill her daughters babies or let them live along with her own babies. I plan to go back and by the one that says COMPLETE SET. If you want it all, go for that. If on the other hand you want the top ten or whatever this 2 disc. set is probably just the ticket. It is sooooo nice to watch the goings on, without the long and frequent commercial breaks that one has to endure on the Animal Planet network. I know their programming is paid for by the commercials but, Lordy there is a ton of em'. So enjoy the uninterupted pleasure of the Meerkat world with any of these sets."
3,"ok, but not the best version availiable","if you don't want to buy DVD-Rs or not get the complete season, buy this one instead!http://www.amazon.com/Meerkat-Manor-By-Animal-Planet/dp/B001CZ7BFE/ref=sr_1_16?ie=UTF8&s;=dvd&qid;=1218420343&sr;=1-16"
2,Meerkats,"They are cute for a few minutes, but overall a bit boring. Nothing compares to David Attenborough's, The Life of Mammals. My 3 year old enjoys The Life of Mammals much more."
5,Meerkat Manor,"The dvds are great. They are both entertaining and full of information. My sons sees how relationships works, how groups function and consequences of behavior. He enjoyed the videos so much that he researched meerkats in greater detail and completed a school term paper on them. The videos do have some scenes that may be hard on younger children. Meerkats die and some are kicked out of group."
5,Until auto makers go back to putting bumpers on cars these are it,"When we bought our new Toyota Corolla, one on the major things wrong was that there were no bumpers. The plastic covered foam things back and front are just too easily crushed and dented. I looked and looked and finally found these strips. They are easy to apply and have been on the car for over 2 years and have helped keep the car from getting scraped up. Until auto makers return to sensible bumpers these are necessary."
1,Imax images from the Grand Canyon,"This is possibly the least professional transfer to DVD I have ever seen. I have purchased copies of this DVD before and it contains scenes not shown in other newer transfers. Other DVDs of the same title I have seen are much better quality. The image quality is very very poor. The images and photography are outstanding. If you are going to purchase this title, be sure you get the most recent version and not this one. The images on this DVD are easily much lower than standard VHS tape."
1,Horrible image quality,I bought this video after a visit to the Canyon and I am very sorry I did. Even with the cheapest vidoe camera you will get better image quality. There is a problem with image sharpness as well as colors. The conversion from IMAX to VHS PAL just killed the pictures. On top of that there is some sort of stupid story that we could do well without.Dont't buy this tape!
1,An Imax Disappointment,"In my home theater I project large screen dvd images with a RUNCO DLP projector. Image quality is usually stunning!! However, I was very disappointed with Grand Canyon. Image quality was very poor!! (Other Imax dvd's that I have are great.)"
4,One of the best IMax,I saw this at an eye max after leaving the park. I loved it.I own practically every eye max. This one is very good. I do not know why other people have rated it poorly. I guess you will have to trust your instincts on tyhis one
1,"Overall, VERY disappointing!","Strange transfer to DVD. I remember being much more impressed with the IMAX film/format in the theater. The disc is anemic. Scratches were transferred directly from the original print to the disc, also the MPEG-2 compression is so horrible that each motion sequence leaves nausea-inducing video artifacts. There was no telecine operator, or if there was he was smoking dope and never actually watched the film transfer of this turkey. At a mere 38 minutes this seems inexcusable, but at least the film mercifully ends prior to me having to take a second dramamine tablet.Bill Conti's score--awful.Hoping next disc is released directly to the landfill thus bypassing the consumer viewing phase."
1,buy the tape,Video quality is not up to DVD standards. Some interesting scenics but very disappointing overall. Score is irritating. I wouldn't invest money in the DVD version (or the tape for that matter). Much better material on this subject exists.
2,Disappointing for DVD,"This DVD was disappointing for two reasons. One, the color, no matter what the scene is brown. Yes, I realize the Grand Canyon is brown, but its comprised of so many beautiful shades that change with the light throughout the day. None of this is captured in the film. Second, the narration is a mumble at best. It's difficult to hear & after a while, you don't even care. Overall, not a good example of IMAX technology."
5,The Grand Canyon,"Excellent documentary. Found out about the movie while visiting the Grand Canyon. We are so happy we purchased this item in the Imax format. You really feel as if you are souring over the canyon, riding the rapids, and standing on the edge. We often watch this movie to relive the experience of actually being there. It makes us eager to return."
2,Not a Good Choice,"Please don't spend your entertainment dollars on this video. It was a tremendous disappointment. The picture quality is not good. If this is the same film shown in IMAX theatres, I bet there were a LOT of unhappy customers. The views of the Grand Canyon are limited and the story line is weak, at best. I never found out what the ""hidden secrets"" were. I am a huge IMAX fan and I knew this would not be the same when viewed on my TV. That was an understatement. If this had been given to me it still would not be any better. Please enjoy images of the Grand Canyon from another source. This is NOT the way you want to do it."
2,Not the same quality as the IMAX theater.,"My dad bought this DVD in Arizona after watching the presentation at the IMAX theater but he was disappointed when we watched it at home on our Sharp LCD projector (on a 5-foot screen). The video quality was VHS-level at best and not even close to what we've become accustomed to from DVD's. The film seemed grainy and the colors were not as distinct and lifelike as they had appeared in the theater. The audio quality was pretty good, but the narration was a bit on the dull side. The camera shots were done pretty well but we were looking forward to more helicopter fly-by shots through the Grand Canyon itself.I hope they re-do this video from scratch and stick to the high-quality film that IMAX theaters are famous for."
2,Disappointed,"Having been a CNE since 1993, I needed to refresh, and update my NetWare skills, so I purchased this book. It was my first choice because it comes from Novell Press.The first chapter had plenty of errors, not just one. I gave the authors the benefit of doubt, and read into chapter two. Mistake, errors there too. So I decided not to continue. Just as when Mark Furman told one inconsistent statement on the jury stand, his entire testimony was called to question, I became suspicious of all content.Oh well, I thought, at least I have the 5-user NW 6 demo disk. I installed the demo disk, and discovered the license expired on 12-31-2001, so its usefulness is limited to administrator login only.There is a lot of information, and I'm sure the overwhelming majority of information is correct, but I am the network guy, not a detective.Do what you will, but I am quite disappointed."
1,Woefully Inaccurate!,"I was only able to read the first 100 pages of this book.It was filled with so much incorrect information, I returned it for a refund.I presume they did a search/replace for NW5.1 and put in NW6.0They had many facts that were correct about NW5.1 but wrong about NW6.Other facts, were just plain wrong for any version of NetWare.This book did cover many topics, but since it was so bad about the topics that I did know, I was afraid to rely on any of the information about topics that I did not know.Please do not buy this book unless you intend to read Novell's On-Line documentation to allow you decipher what is real and what is not real."
5,A real gem.,"A great collection of poker stories by such great writers as Al Alvarez, Martin Amis, David Mamet, Somerset Maugham, John Updike, Mark Twain, James Thurber and many others. A real gem of a book."
2,OK I guess--pretty expensive,"After ordering these and paying over $12.00 by the time they were shipped, I think I'm going without the filters in the future. I have a similar capability Cuisinart coffee maker at work and I get three filters for it for half the price of the Krups' filters."
5,"Krups, please do not discontine this too!","Expensive but these filters really do prevent build up of scale in coffeemaker, and subsequently also in carafe. Coffee taste seems to maintain freshness between cleanings as well thanks to filter. Krups no longer makes the carafe for my machine, but thank goodness these still are manufactured. Each filter comes individually vacuum-sealed so they arrive safely even when other item purchased leaked. Best prices are on Amazon for these."
3,Won't stay where they belong for some reason,"I suppose these work fine for filtering, although I've never been able to tell much difference in the taste of the coffee with or without them, but maybe others can. What I don't like about these is that the filter holder floats with these and I have to hold it down until a few minutes into the brewing time. The filters I've used in the past didn't have this problem. I've been using one of these once daily for over a week and it is still floating. I hope with a little more use the filter holder will stay down where it should be. When it floats out of the depression in the tank, the water does not flow through it so the water does not get filtered. These look like the old ones so I can't imagine what the difference is."
3,Krupps Coffee Maker Water Filter,"Purchased extra filter with coffee maker. Do not know how effective it is, but use it for peace of mind."
3,"Tastes Great, Less filling",THE WATER FILTER IS WORKING PERFECTLY. I CAN TELL A DIFFERENCE ALREADY IN THE COFFEE'S QUALITY.
1,No instructions - I don't know where to put the pod or how to use it.,Please give me instrudtions where they go and how I can use them in my Krups KM720050 Coffee Pot.I have used Krups Coffee Pots since 1992. They are excellent - but I also knew where to place the filter.H E L P !
5,Coffee Filters,Item from Ace Hardware. Arrived in perfect condition and is in operation. It took a little longerto receive but overall a good experience.
5,The filters really work,"The price was very competitive, especially since I was unable to locate the filter at local stores!Good deal and good service"
2,I wouldn't know,"My Krups FME1-14 12-Cup Coffeemaker developed a terminal leak after 2 months, so it was too late to return it or the 4 extra filters I'd bought for it. I do hate wasting money."
5,Duofilters review,"When I use free trade naturally decaffinated freshly ground coffee beans and the Duofilter in my Krups coffeemaker, I get the smoothest most delicious cup of coffee available anywhere on the planet! It beats out any coffee served today at a gourmet coffee shop. I also found the best price for Duofilters here on Amazon."
5,Great product,"The Krups DuoFilters help bring out the real flavor of the coffee. They make a very real difference in the taste of your coffe.JonelleDesoto, TX"
4,"Great coffee maker - Unfortunely, need to pre-heat carafe","Pot brews excellent coffee. Unfortunately, the metal carafe requires pre-heating to keep brewed coffee hot for longer periods of time. Makes it inconvienient to have coffee ready when you wake up. Would be great if coffee could be brewed in glass carafe and then transfered to pre-heated metal carafe, but glass and metal are not interchangable in this model."
2,Soul Growth -- Hard to Follow,YAWN! It's over my head and doesn't generate enough interest for me to pursue trying to figure out what the heck this guy is talking about.
4,Back to the old frother,"Krups has been installing a hard plastic cover on the frother wand of their recent models. This technology is neither as effective nor as resilient as the old ""perfect froth"" attachment. My hard plastic one broke within two weeks, and sending it back to Krups elicited no response at all, so I just bought the ""perfect froth"" attachment, and it works fine."
4,They're Ok,Well as my title says.... they're ok. If you lost or broke the one that came with the original machine then this one is a good replacement.
2,Stopped working,As long as it worked I loved this frother. Worked well for about 6 months and just recently stopped working.
5,Great replacement milk frother,This is a great buy for anyone who loves lattes and fine coffees. Price is right and the product is well made.
5,Perfect fit,"This is exactly what I needed, and it was cheaper than the manufacturer's website. This piece is essential for making just the right froth on your steamed milk. On my Krups Gusto you can steam milk without this piece but it isn't exactly the right consistency. So once again, thanks alatte Amazon."
1,Boring.,"Sorry folks...I just found it boring, monotonous, nothing grabbed me. The only thing that isn't boring is Devin's vocalization. Note that this does not include the lyrics. Boring drumming, and the widest scale I heard for the guitar notes and chords dont seem to spread out much wider than half an octave. Very monotone.Also, I would have actually preferred buying Strapping Young Lad based on the reviews I read, but the MP3 download option was not available. I prefer that unless I am buying an album that I already know I like.Sorry Devin."
3,Lots of songs; sound quality lacking,"This 3-disk set has 77 Andrews Sisters songs, and pretty good choices. However, it comes from a Dutch label called ""Disky"" and was mastered by a London company called ""Ideal Mastering,"" and the sound quality just isn't great. It's not unlistenable, but it could definitely be better. This may be a good starter set for someone who wants to explore the music of the Andrews Sisters without spending much, but if you want an Andrews Sisters album for sheer listening pleasure, I'd recommend something from a known label."
4,Works Well,"This works pretty well, you have to make sure that your paint can is very secure before turning it on lest it shoot out. We like it."
2,"poorly packaged, piece also missing","I purchased the Tornado 11 Electric Paint Shaker , the product was shipped to East Granby CT and on-forward to Australia where I live. The product came in a very large box with next to no packaging which meant all the support arms were loose and had been moving around at will during transit, not very happy about that. The box came intact with no damage yet upon opening and asembling the top of the unit there was meant to be two handles with 5/16"" threads that screw the very top bar into the side uprights yet I only received one in the box, again very unprofessional.As for the shaker it works fine and operates as per the recommendations , yes I bought a bolt to fit the thread pattern. The packaing I would rate 2 out of ten simply for the box it was put in."
1,Toxie Blood Bank 10 Disc Collector's Set,"Toxie Blood Bank 10 Disc Collector's SetA piece of garbage from start to finish. I mean the visual quality of the movies themselves are sub-par. I mean, I am a huge fan of crappy B movies from the 80's and I watched all of these movies and threw them away. Keep your money in your pocket on this one."
4,4 1/2 Actually.,"Lyrically this is the best I've heard Juvenile. He rhymes very well with the beat that goes along with his songs. My favorite song by far is either Got Your Hustle On, or the one that was produced by Lil Jon. I think this CD is a must by especially figuring there hasnt been alot of good Rap cds released lately. I would also look out for the NEW T.I AND LIL FLIPPA."
1,Southern Bell,To be honest the cd did not sound good at all to me. I think he did a much better job with juve the great cd.Ithink he needs to change some of his lyrics some he`s getting to old for some of the stuff he rapps about. I bought the cd a waste of my time and a waste of my money. I did not like the cd at all SORRY JUVIE.
1,JUVENILE need to GROW the hell UP,JUVENILE first of all need to grow up the cd was dirt. HE do not care any thing or should i say nothing about his fans at all.I heard him tell a girl about three weeks ago when he was in the atl. for his album release party that he did`t give a f--k about her and none of ya`ll b---hs I just want you to support my music. HE had got into a confirtation with a female at the club and that`s when let the cat out of the bag. I think he had been drinking or druging that night. HE even got into it with the white dj. Very nasty attuide i was a die hard fan until i heard that come out of his mouth and saw how ugly his attuide was
2,Hit&Miss,Got Ya Hustle on is tight. He pulls no Punches about His feelings&how things He takes it to the Goverment&I like that edge. I ain't feeling the Cut with Brian Mcknight too tough though. Rodeo is cool&it works. glad to see Juv doing his thing again. i like some of the Production&some things are Hit&Miss.but overall this disc is ok.
1,Juvenile is a poseur rapper who needs to hang it up,"Before I review this sophomoric artist called Juvenile, I am sick of seeing these 5 star reviewers praising some glorified thug who is called Juvenile, juvenile delinquent is more like it. Anyone who bashes FEMA and our President(like this loser whom is probably best friends with bigot king Kanye West) deserves to be sentenced to death. Get Ya Hustle On and What's Happenin' are very awful and bland. This bozo only cares about money and not his fans and is a racist. This guy is a sexist, bigot, hypocrite, greedy tyrant. Avoid and buy any Slayer album now."
1,Who would like this loser pimped up rapper,"Blue Racer: Say, this Juvenile lives up to his name. Japanese Beetle: Serpent son, this rapper is a bonafide hypocrite. Blue Racer: You ain't kidding, Get Ya Hustle On and What's Happening are bashing our government, FEMA and our President who did tell the governor of that backward state Louisiana to evacuate but they didn't listen. Japanese Beetle: Say Serpent son, this loser should keep quiet as he has a criminal record, degrades women in most of his songs, praises killing people, looting and plundering. For that HAASAH!(chops Juvenile's head off), SAYONARA!"
5,Good album from Juve!,Pretty good album. Only a few songs I didn't like but the rest were hot. Another great effort from Juve!TOP TRACKS:Get Ya Hustle OnSets Go UpWay I Be Leanin'RodeoWhat's Happaning
4,missing leaked songs,"I cant beleive the label chose not to include ""come out ya laundry"" or ""early bird"". songs that were on the internet leak and two of the best tracks that could've have been on the album. come out ya laundry would have been a bigger hit than get ya hustle on. i guess i'll just have to add them my self. those tracks did make it on to the dj drama mixtape we on bubble feat. juve & utp"
5,What,yo for real the only guerros here are panho and toro yo im latino fo real not like those two there two white kids that probly just look up some shoot in a spanish english dictionarythe cd is bumping like whats happening and rodeo sets go up hisis much better some other realeases
1,What a dumbkuff of a rapper who should be JUVENILE DELINQUENT!,"Juvenile is like every other rapper, a sexist, communist, greedy, tyrannical, racist thug. I mean who can like this dumbkuff but either a person who likes eMptyTV created rap or some Vanilla Ice type kid. We have heard snippets of these songs Get Ya Hustle On and What's Happenin' are taking cheapshots at FEMA(many who have relatives who work for them will hate this song, myself included), the President whom is trying his hardest(I guess Juvenile wants to be another Kanya-ya-ya, the moron who says white people are to blame for everything). The rest of these things called muzak which is garbage is all rants about killing fellow people, degrading women and their body parts, looting and pilla-ga, stealing(which this dumbkuff got busted for in addition to being arrested for carrying illegal firearms). The Tijuana Toads are Mexican frogs BTW and I am a shark from Germany who appreciates real music. Avoind or HEEGOTCHA!"
2,Sloppy,The songs on this c.d. are just plain wack. I loved the old Juvenile so i thought i may as well go ahead and buy this album. But I was wrong to do that. Juvenile's last album was hot and this album was nowhere near that. No creativity and the hooks sucked. Production was also awful. Sorry Juve but this album was not your best. Could have done a lot better.
4,"juve's an artist of the ghetto reality, u wouldnt understand.","as with many fanz, i have waited fa this album to drop fa quite some time now and i can truly say that i was very satisfied with the lyricz as well as the production,but itz definately not a classic album but it sure duz jam tha *@&!! off tha streetz in my avalanche truck. so ya gotta go get this right now or you'll be missin out. furthermore, if u not up on CMRz works then you might want to stick with eminem's stuff bcuz this album is strictly fa the ghetto.nuff said.DJSIRLEXX."
1,Terrible!,Nookie is the worst song I've heard all year. I hope these guys become washed up has-beens!
1,Not a good album at all,"The way this music sounds is irratating, dull, and very null. I get no stimulation from any of the songs. It is music for those who's brains havn't developed correctly. Some of the people who listen to this music, just do it because it is popular. And the others are the ones who like it. I just hate it. Oh well, but that's my opinion"
5,high quality music,"As a true metal head I can honestly say that this cd is a masterpiece. Limp Bizkit can get heavier than just about anyone. It's more rock than rap, so buy it now."
2,Not from your generation.,"I have a 12-year old son who is very interested in your music. I am trying to have a open mind - but at this stage of his pre-adolescent, I don't. Typical parental thing. I hear messages in your music and I suppose that your explicit language is part of your artistry. I know it's the generation-gap repeating itself, old people hate young peoples music. My son wanted me to be informed about you so I did read your article in Guitar which I found it very positive.I'm sure there will be a time when my son is alittle older, he will be listening more to your music. By the way, on your censored CD's - why don't you sell them nationwide? If it wasn't for the awful language I would consider letting him listen to it at his age."
1,Aweful,"Even worst then there first effort, They are the warrant of the 90's. 5 years from now on vh1's where are they now? they will have the (c)rap rock section with korn, limp bizkit and all them"
1,"wow, those guys sure have talent of writing bad cds","well, ""3 dollar bill..."" sucks, ""significant other"" sucks, ""chocolate starfish..."" sucks. just to say this is a touch better then ""chocolate starfish"". but being a bit better then one of the most miserable albums around doesn't make this one good. the music itself is very simple, freds rapping isn't good at all, the lyrics are dumb etc. (i wrote the same about ""chocolate starfish.."") i guess it is mainstream music, and that sucks almost always."
1,they are wack,what a wack group period.they aren't doing anything that Run Dmc didn't do 16 years back.except Dmc was a legit group.this group has no musical skills and can't rap or sing.as legit as the boy bands?
2,Too much rap,"This one is not nearly as good as the 1st one. When it first came out I dodn't think it had thay sound I like in it. This one is more rap than rock I mean c'mon, the first one's got some screaming in it and is actually rock. How could he just sing plain rap in this one.So this proves that Limp Bizkit has really gotten Limp and will never again be a rock band."
5,Great CD.,"The cd rules. Every song is cool, but they are killer live. If you ever get the chance to see them live, go. I nearly passed out and got dehydrated, but i had the time of my life. Definately worth the $30 I payed to get in. The cd's definately worth the $15 you'll pay for it."
1,What happened?,"This record is some of the most terrible crap on wax. People brag about seing Limp Bizkit at family values, I've seen seen them like eight times since 1996, yes they have been around that long. If you're a fan of this disk, you should get 3 dollar bill y'all so you can hear what the band sounded like when they were good."
5,Sophmore jinx??? What sophmore jinx???,"Limp Bizkit has broken the ""sophmore jinx"" with flying colors. This CD is Limp Bizkit's ""Significant Other"". THIS CD ROCKS!!!!! It is everything Three Dollar Bill,Yall$ was....AND BETTER!!!! With the addition of musical genuises such as Jonathan Davis,Method Man,and Scott Weiland add just the touch of kick @$$ vocals in addition to the already kick @$$ music to make this CD the best ever!!!! The enhanced CD part is also very kick @$$. So what you need to do is drive a half hour to your local record store, whip out your wallet,grab fifteen bucks, AND PURCHASE THE DAMN CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Are These Guys For Real?,"Alrighty, I never heard Limp Bizkit before, but I am a massive Kid Rock fan, and I figured, hey, if their good enough to tour with Kid Rock, then I had better give them a try. Well, this CD almost made me want to sell my front row seat to the Limp/Rock tour. I am sorry to all Limp Bizkit fans, but unless you are a DIE HARD Limp fan, this CD is most definaetly not for you."
4,good but worried about next album,Most of the lyrics are good but i can tell Fred wants a rap album. n2gethernow is a rap song just like this is kinda a rap song show what u got is more on the rap side break stuff is a bad song so u can kinda tell he is not to good at writing rock exept which is the best song on the cd. but that accually happened to him so its easier to write about. i hope fred makes another rock album like 3 dollar bill y'all
3,Not great follow up to the 1st one,"This Cd was ""okay"" it wasn't GREAT and it kinda dissapointed me because I loved 3 dollar bill Y'all a lot and i was excited for their 2nd album. There is one thing i must credit Limp Bizkit for doing is that they have tried something new and they are not sticking to same to the samne old things. But with the new style came more rap and less and less guitar and bass and hardcore musical talet that the band showed in their other album. I think they should of took more time on some things like the guitar and worked harder to the keep the rock audiance into them as well as their hip hop audiance. But still this CD has some fun catchy songs such as ""I'm broke"" and ""No sex"""
5,This CD is the best!!!!!!,If you liked the first cd of Limp Bizkit then you'll love this one. Every single song on this album is awesome. It is definetely the best cd ever made!!!!
3,Good But Not Excellent,"Other than Nookie this Cd Has no meaning. How can you mix Rap and Heavy metal, I dont get that? Limp Bizkit is good but sometimes I CAnt stand thier music. This CD Is an improvement from Three Dollar Bill Ya'll But that's it It was an O.K. CD....."
5,This CD is awesome.,"I think Significant Other has many more potential single songs other than Nookie, such as Break Stuff, I'm Broke, and 9 teen 90 nine."
3,not as good as the first,"I was expecting this to be as good as the first when i bought it, but i was wrong. It is still a pretty good cd, it was too mellow though(for limp anyway). The best songs are no sex,break stuff,just like this and nobody like you. n 2 gether now and nookie are ok too. This is good but if you wanna hear something better, buy the first cd, or something by KoRn. Hopefully, the next one will be better"
2,Nothing New,"I heard some of this album and it is definitely nothing new. What Limp Bizkit is doing has been done before, and much better. If you enjoy the rap/rock/metal of Limp Bizkit, then listen to Rage Against the Machine because their music is much more passionate and meaningful than anything Limp Bizkit has released up to now. ""Three Dollar Bill, Y'all"" was a step in the right direction for this band, but ""Significant Other"" is not in my opinion."
1,This is Limp Bizkit?,"You'll like this cd depending on when you bought it, if you bought it like a poser when you first heard ""Faith"" you'll definitely enjoy ""Significant Other"". If you're like me and bought 3 Dolla Bill Y'all around 2-3 years ago, and are a real fan, ""Signifacant Other"" will suck after one playing."
2,not that bad,white zombie style techno -but not as good..... beastie cypress style raps - but not as good..... tool style heavy metal sludge - but not as good..... janes addiction 9 inch style whining - but not as good....the surpising thing is that the album doesnt suck really really bad ......... and that it was able to reach number one. its kind of monotonous. its not great. the guys in the band are total suburban style high school mall geeks. but so are a lot of kids. obviously.
1,Weak lyrics and soft music,"Alright... it breaks down like this... The first four songs are great, hard hitting, hip hop lyrics true Korn/Limp Bizkit style. Then they break into this melodic garbage, painfully reminiscent of Sprung Monkey or Sugar Ray. What LB has done is created a song (Nookie) that they play on the radio and MTV that alot of people will like. Then when you buy the CD you get mindless drivel. That song I'm broke, Fred, my man, do you have a ten year old brother who wrote those lyrics (""...get a job like you should, jerk"" Jerk, jerk? Did you just call someone a jerk? Oh the horror!)? I'm really disappointed, I was really looking forward to Limp Bizkit getting better with age, like Korn..."
2,This cd sucks compared to 3 Dolla Bill Yall...,"Limp Bizkit sold out... and thats all there is to it. The only good songs on this cd are break stuff and no sex, the rest are MTV crap. Their first cd was all about real stuff and hardcore music, now its blown to hip hop stupid crap music... im sorry limp bizkit, but i lost the faith in ya!"
1,I was too generous,"You may have read my review where I gave them 2 stars. I was wrong, this does not deserve 2 stars. Not even Scott Weiland and Jonathan Davis could save this album. It's that bad. ""N2gether Now"" is just Fred attempting to rap, and doing a ...poor job at it, Method Man(being the MUCH, MUCH, MUCH better lyricisist) makes him sound even worse. Like I said before, Fred should be grateful that people who actually have talent are willing to share a mic with him."
3,Fred Knows Good Stars,I give this album 3 stars just because of Fred's use of Scott Weiland (STP). He knows an artist when he hears one.
1,limp cd,if u r in to some heavy metal like Slipknot or korn u will hate this album.i found this to b one of the worst CDs of the year.Dont by it is a waste of money.and believe me i like sum good music and this just sucked
3,an ok cd,"the new limp bizkit CD is pretty cool i guess. if you really liked three dollar bill y'all and was hoping that this one will be just like it, you will be in for a great dissappointment"
2,"Great the first time....ok the second, bland the third","Sounded great at first, but now.......I just dont like it anymore, its just so trendy. There really isnt any meat, it reminds me of glam metal. No real feeling, just picked a market, and made songs to fit the market."
2,A new era - s**t music makes millions,"The new rap/rock combo has been getting major bucks but the actual sound of the music is horrible. There's no beat and the guitar mind-as-well be a noise maker. The rap is ""hardcore wanna be"". Fix up the style, because there's nothing worth buying here."
1,A disgrace to the American metal scene,"Limp Bizkit is the perfect example of everything wrong with the American heavy music scene. The lyrics are unbelievably cliched, the music is poorly executed, and there is almost no real melody. I'm sorry if that hurts,but it's the truth. This ""band"" is quite awful. All of the songs are verse-chorus-verse, with no progression. The same chords are used repeatedly, with the same pattern. This is why Norway and Sweden have much better scenes. Those countries don't bow to trends, they create them, perfect them, and then surpass them. Don't waste your money on Limp Bizkit, buy some Iced Earth or Shadows Fall, both bands who do the American scene proud. We'll beat those Scandinavians yet!"
1,Limp is exactly what they are,"Limp Bizkit...Pioneers in the Death Metal Arena. ""Significant Other"" marks the return of their speeding thrashy riffs and blistering extended guitar solos. The double kick drums are a metal tour de force while Fred's raspy growls and lung fired screams embody the very essence of metals true nature. With the bands current line-up they are sure to tour with Metal vets such as the ever vigilant Whitesnake , the blood drenched raw power of Hootie and the Blowfish, and of course metal greatest vocalist and master of orignality Kid Rock. Had Limp Bizkit kept their repetitive beats, Rap-influenced whiney vocals and slow uninspired drums this album may have sucked. The hint of sarcasm in this reveiwers tone can only be summed up as...Priceless."
3,"Pleasing to the ears, pleasing to the world","Well im not going to beat around the bush.This CD is good value for money.This CD has great songs.This CD is fred Durst at his best.This CD is good if you like 'take a look around'.This CD features Method Man, and the song 'N2Gether now'.This CD is a little different to 'Three Dollar Bill, yall' (Limp bizkits other album).This CD has a CDRom compatible feature.This CD has a nice picture on the cover that you can draw and say is your ownGood CD all round, buy it, you wont regret it."
5,Awesome Sophomore effort!!,"I don't see what all the fuss is about, 99% of all metal bands swear. Fred Durst is cool. Wes Borland is a great guitarist. Sam is a great bassist. John otto is the world's best drummer. Lethal is great too. This album flat out rocks! To hell with the critics!"
1,More hardcore covers of 80's pop comin' at ya,"The band that would be Korn, except there already was a band called that is back with more wax for the white male 17-24 fraternity crowd. ""Oh, wow this is like the best thing to happen to me since like, Ozzfest!"""
5,THE BEST!!!,"This cd is the best evr made by Limp Bizkit. It is more of a Rapcore type of music than 3 dollar bill. But it still kiks. I think that everyone should get their hands on this cd quickly, because you won't see it in the stores for long. I think Fred really went over the top on this cd. THANKS FRED!!!!!!!!!"
3,3 dollar bills ya'll,"well after reading most of these reviews i can see i'm not alone.most everyone thinks that heavy metal bizkit is the true bizkit.n2gether now?please stop fred.show me what you got.need i say more.the first album was something i get into.i was in 6th grade (1998) when one of my ""cutting edge/underground"" friends brought in a copy of 3 dollar bills ya'll.i've heard bizkits name mentioned in magazines but have never seen or heard them.after hearin counterfeight i was hooked.i heard it on the radio a couple of times after but that first time listeing to it on a school computer during snack break was something special.i got the cd saw the video once for counterfeight and faith a million times.then came the summer of limp 99.nookie rocked.i won't lie.i was excited for this album like none other ever before.but what i ended up with is something almost as bad as system ofa down.(ouch)"
3,Not bad but.. What is it?,"I only needed to listen one song ""NOOKIE"" to realize that this guys have quite enough to be great, well, they are already famous. Usually,I don't like this kind of music (What is his name) but Nookie is a good song, if only they could be more creative on lyrics... WHy to use bad words? I'm a heavy metal fan and no, this is no heavy metal... I' still sayin'... What the hell is this"
4,A good album but with lack of anything really original.,"The title of my review tells my opinion the best. If you like this kind of music, the album is a sure choice. But I think I better warn you, you may get bored too quickly. All in all, all the tracks are alike. So if you've heard one, you know what the 13 (not intro and outro) are. If you think you can live with this :) go ahead and buy it. But after a month when you are so bored with it that you regret buying it, don't come to me whining.. :)"
3,Eh,"Well, I used to like Limp Bizkit, and now I don't, I guess I've changed for the better. After much reflection, though, I realized this album isn't really that bad. A few of the tracks are pretty good, namely ""No Sex"" and ""Just Like This"". There's a lot better stuff out there, but Limp Bizkit isn't really as bad as everyone says they are."
4,A cool follow-up,"People say this CD is bad and comparible to Follow the Leader. I beg to differ.Follow The Leader was mostly hip-hop. Significant Other is not. Almost every song is heavy and original, for example, ""Break Stuff"" and ""9 Teen 90 Nine. They even put a few soft songs on there, like ""No Sex"" and ""Don't Go Off Wandering"". Even the rap song ""N 2 Gether Now"" is much better than ""Children Of The KoRn"" on Follow The Leader.Even though this CD is no 3 Dollar Bill, I reccomend it."
5,WOW,limp bizkits new album is amazing. i got their first album a year ago and have been hooked ever since. they have great talent and now how to put it to a good use. plus it doesnt hurt that FRED DURST is a major hottie
1,what talent? where?,"I like one song on this CD--""Nobody Like You."" For the most part, the CD is full of Fred Durst whining about his ex-girlfriends or females in general. There's a minimal amount of talent here."
1,"Just terrible, just purely awful...","This album from Limp Bizkit doesn't come even close to their first album in terms of lyrics, singing and guitar riffs. Even some of their songs like Break Stuff sounds way too fake. Nookie just irritates me, awful singing, really stupid lyrics and bad guitar riffs. Even the other songs sounds way too teeny-boppy for to be even a rap-metal album. Not only that, stay away from Korn and Kid Rock. They also sound very unoriginal. Anyone who wants real good metal should listen to System Of A Down, Slipknot, 16 Volt, Ministry, Powerman 5000, Pitchshifter, Coal Chamber, Nine Inch Nails and Fear Factory."
1,"Sorry, this is not for me either!","Limp Bizkit are pointless clowns who even get caught up in the act of winning a thousand reviews and an Enhanced CD. Not fair! And that damned ""Nookie"" piece of s**t is pointless, too. Hell, the whole thing is crazy! Their fans won't care."
1,Limp is the only word to describe them,"Actually one star is pretty harsh. I guess there are a few people out there who think bad boy posing, 'explicit' lyrics and childish songs are good. The same people that will buy the album cos 'That nookie song on MTV was good!'. Pah. Well pose with all your rock and rap friends all you like Fred because the only fans you're taking with you are the ones who aren't going to give a damn when the next trend comes along and leaves you washed up. I can't believe this is by the same band who released '3 Dollar Bill Y'all'..."
1,Hated it,"I also have one word for everybody that rated it higher than 2 stars. WAKE UP AND SMELL THE WORLD. ALSO, LEARN TO SPELL"
4,"limp bizkit, love them","why do all people just critisise, why not just listen to it then dont listen to it again. they are following there dreams, and you are smashing them.true, they ar enot th emost talented band out there, there first 3 cd's, three dollar bill yall, significant other, and chocolat starfish were good examples of them following there dreams. all you guys do is hate. you hate everything.i am ashamed to be 17 years old in this pathetic generation, go listen to britney spears you dumb-&*(%i like limp bizkit because they dont care. they dont care what you think, i listen to them when im mad, and i simply love them. they get me through my day. so what do you got?"
1,TRL Garbage,"This is the most overrated album of all time. But what can you expect, its Limp Bizkit. They were bound to tap into the minds of all the MTV damaged viewers."
5,"Funny Name, Good Music","When I first heard of this band I thought that it would just be a bunch of noise, but I borrowed the CD from my friend and loved it. 50% of the songs are great and their is only about 2 bad ones. There is not too much swearing either. Listening to this CD got me to like other bands like Korn,Orgy,Dre, and Eminem. I would definetly reccommend buying this CD. Heck, my mom even likes it!"
2,a grossly overrated band,"I think Limp Bizkit could be a much better band if they dropped the hip-hop angle. It interferes with what could be good music. The only reason I grudgingly gave this 2 stars is Wes Borland's cool guitar tone. This album doesn't show us anything we haven't seen before. Though Fred Durst isn't necessarily a bad singer, his exaggerated hip-hop/urban persona has got to go. This band may be popular in the short term but do you honestly think they can keep up this schtick 10 years from now? Hopefully this ugly wave of rap/metal will disappear, the sooner the better."
1,This is not good music.,"Limp Bizkit is horrible. Here is alist of a few really great rock bands.1)R.E.M.2)Ben Folds Five3)The Smashing Pumpkins4)Radiohead5)Oasis6)Fountains of Wayne7)Guster8)Pearl JamIf you want to hear good music, buy a record by one of them; not Limp Bizkit."
3,A VERY AVERAGE ALBUM,"LB's second album is actualy more on the LYRICS side which is good, but the overall feeling of this album is cold, dark, and very stressful. BUY THIS CD AT YOUR OWN RISK!"
5,The best band in the world!,"Limp Bizkit is the best music group in this world! The CD rocks but i like their old one a little better. Don't get me wrong! I gave this a 5 star rating because this CD is one of my favorites! To all those people who think rock is dead, it's not. I saw a lot of reviews that said ""Limp Bizkit sux and the whole world thinks so"". Well that isnt true becuz this CD is one of the top on the Billboard charts! Limp Bizkit is the coolest band ever and they rock!"
5,BUY THIS CD!,"You just have to buy this CD. Don't listen to those people who give this 1 star, most of them are the same person trying to give Limp Bizkit a bad name. Fred Durst has got to be one of the most talented people out in the music world today. So BUY THIS CD at Amazon.com!"
3,"Band-Good, Fred-Annoying","It's too bad such an able and creative band is stuck with a twit like Fred Durst. I liked the first album quite a bit and when I heard Nookie I was anxious to get this album. After hearing the whole thing it's apparent Mr. Durst doesn't have much on his mind other than whether he should nail some girl or not. Wait, he also talks about breaking stuff, huh-huh uhhh huh-huh huh. I can put up with it though since the music is good and Fred can sing when he wants to. Maybe on the next album he'll move on to more mature subject matter like wearing rubbers and super-gluing the stuff he broke."
2,curse of the sophmore jynx strikes another band,"this is one of those cd's you buy and you immediatly try to validate why you bought it ten to twenty minutes later, it does have three good song's and the band (minus fred) shows alot of growth but other than that it's just not that good."
5,Great good better,"A kick azz CD. go and get it. you wont be dissapointed. the best tracks are break stuff, i'm broke, 9 teen 9 nine, n 2 gether now, trust?, Show me what you got and track 16. just indulge yourself and spend the money. thanks for listening to me blab. get three dollar bill yall$"
5,One great album!,"Not only does it have the type of rock that I crave, but it also have great songs and great guests. The only part I don't like about this album is N 2 gether now, because it doesn't have any rock in it, just rap. Other than that, this album is a must have!"
1,I can't believe I had to give this CD a star at all.,"This is a sell-out CD. If you want to be ""trendy"" and ""cool,"" then go ahead and waste your money on it. With Fred, the profanity-obsessed singer singing ridiculously ludicrous lyrics, this CD truly needs work. The most meaningful lyrics are ""Should've kept my pants on this time, instead you let me dive right in."" Can you say worthless? I have to say, the only song that didn't burn my ears was the one with Jon Davis, but it was still just mediocre. My advice is to listen to the songs on MTV, and pass on buying the CD. When I got this CD, I was expecting it to be like ""Three Dollar Bill Y'all$"" but it wasn't even close. I am truly disappointed."
2,I wish I never heard it!,"Well I hated this cd because they love to copy peoples songs and try to get rich, hey Fred Hurst you need to rehearse, you need to reverse what your saying!!!"
5,This CD Rules!!,This is such a cool album. After I heard 'Nookie' I knew it would be awesome. And Fred Durst is really hot.
5,Simply Awesome!,This album is a threat to civilzed american life. Don't let your kids get ahold of this one.
4,Some Thoughts,"I myself, loved this album. I do not understand though, why someone would come here and write a trashing review. No need to be nasty. Each person has their own taste/sound/style. These guys work really hard to put out their music. It's a part of them. If you don't like it, then don't buy it."
1,Is this some kind of joke?,"I must say that when I first heard their version of ""Faith"", I felt particularly nautious. Now that they have put out yet another album, and it is selling well, I can plainly see the decay that is America's youth. I firmly believe that I am dumber as a result of having listened to this crap. I am insulted that these guys consider this music. I have heard more appealing sounds from a garbage compactor, which is exactly where everything Limp Bizkit records belongs. Enjoy your 15 minutes guys...the ride is a short one."
1,nookie is the only good one,I would have to admit nookie is an awesome and great song which generally makes it an average cd without this song though i would give negative 1. Every other song generally has terrible lyrics and gets on my nerves. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!
5,If you liked the first album one you will love this one!!!,3 dollar bill yall has some pretty boring lyrics. And alot of similar beats. Significant Other has hard rock snd rap + alot of different types of songs. Some are heavy some are mellow and some have awsome hip-hop beats. This is a hot summer album if you don't have it get it!!
2,Limp went Limp!!!!!!!!!,"When i got this c.d. i was so pumped. I thought , yeah, more music from the guys that created $3 dollar bill yall$. I played the c.d. and i was horribly dissappointed. Music wise it is watered down. No heavy guitar riffs, no heavy bass to support the music, and sounds as if the drummer lost a arm b/c the drums are weaker than the kid from hanson. Vocally, fred killed the album before it had a chance. He has no anger or loudness or yelling in the whole thing. If want to hear some limp bizkit buy 3 dollar bill yallz, i get one of the best metal albums of the past couple of years. Buy if you must but be warned ""don't hold it up to high expectations b/c you will be dissappointed."
5,this album kicks buttock cheek,this is the best limp bizkit album to date wes borland kicks serious buttock cheek!
1,Wanna be white boy trailer park over produced trash,for angry little boys with plenty of testosterone built up through their sheltered adolecence
1,Boooooring.,"This band is basicaly a 3rd rate version of Korn, which is pretty pathetic seeing as Korn isn't even a good band. They play a mixture of whiteboy hip-hop, no-talent metal, and fake newschool hardcore."
4,GOOD BUT NOT GREAT,"This is a decent CD but it lacks something. Maybe if they would just choose if they're rap or rock it would be better. I'm more of a rap lover than a rock lover, and I just wish I knew if they were rap or rock. If they get around this crossover stuff they would be an awesome band. The track with Method Man is the best ""N 2 gether Now"" and ""Nookie"" is okay. Hopefully they'll go more rap oriented, but until then I'll stick to Jay-Z, the (former) Fugees, and Puffy."
1,i think it was too shallow,it was to bad that limp didnt bring out the stuff they had in 3$ bill yall. this cd was horrible. kid rock and korn are much better. i have to agree with benniebabe
3,tuned down way too much,The editing ruined the songs and they are too soft now. Want real Limp Bizkit? get Three Doller Bill Yall
2,What The Hell??,"Well, first of all, I drove 2 hours just to buy this album. It was one of the most worthless trips I have made. What happened? This one has nothing of what made the first album kick. I love Limp Bizkit, but I don't have any clue where they thought they were going with this album. What I think is they see the popularity and hey!, let's put out an album everyone will like. Where's the raw, edgy power? Maybe it will get them on TRL if that's what they are going for. Look at the other artists on there. A great group!?? The songwriting is quite bad. I should've known when Carson Daly loved this album. Maybe I'm being too hard on them after a few listens and maybe I'll grow to like it. This album comes nowhere close to the original. It shouldn't be the same, but it should bring the noise. I think I'll file this under easy listening."
1,Dear Lord...,"I bought this cd off the advice of my friend which wasnt very good advice. This cd is a piece of commericial trash that should be thrown away. The lyrics dont even make sense half the time and when they do its pointless and has no reason. Im sick of hearing Fred Durst preach about how Napster is good and record companies are bad. Its all publicity to make him seem like the good guy. After all he is vp of Interscope. I will give Fred and Limp credit for one thing though, they can market themselves. They make all these insecure high school kids think that they have some kind of connection with them. Even the founder of Napster doesnt really like them. He even said ""When did Fred Durst become our spokesman, why cant we get some one cool like Weezer"". He is right, go buy Weezer. Some real music for you."
1,god awful shash,"please do not buy this album. it has no melody, no tune, nothing vaguely intelligent. this is dumb music for dumb people. buy only if you are a brain dead ape who needs something to take their mind off scratching their arse. still, my brother says he'll pay me extra if i buy it so what the hell?"
2,"Can we say ""Sell Out?""","The first LB album was great...I still listen to it non-stop. I was really disappointed with this album. There's hardly any of the hardcore rock that you hear on ""Three Doller Bill, Ya'll."" This album was pretty much all Fred Durst rapping to a band playing in the background. I think that this band has sold out to rap music and is starting to go down the wrong road. Sure..some of these songs aren't bad, but i prefer the old Limp Bizkit."
5,Definetly Worth the Money,"Significant Other is unlike any other CD I own. It is always fun to listen to. What surprised me is that the hits on this album are not the best songs, even though they are awesome. There are some tracks on the CD that I couldn't believe were not hits like 11, 8, 7, and especially 2. Just Like This is extremely catchy and it has not been played on the radio or MTV. It can also be found on the Big Daddy soundtrack. Trust? is probably the loudest song on the album. My favorite song on the album is Rearranged. It took me awhile to like Rearranged, but after I listened to it a couple times it was my favorite song! I cannot believe that Limp Bizkit aren't on MTV's The Return of Rock. Trust? would be the perfect song for Limp Bizkit to put on it."
4,"Jeeze people, lay off.","Man! what is up with that one guy? Limp Bizkit is not all that bad. He,or She, said that it expresses testosterone and wanting to hurt people. Thats the reason I have this CD! I like songs that express a harsh attitude. Break Stuff, and Re-Arranged are my favorite songs, but mostly Break Stuff is. That song expresses how he feels, and thats what music is suppost to do, express how you feel. And in the song he is explaining how ( ) off he is! Re-Arranged is a song about him breaking up with his girl and what is happening between them. Its not a bad song. So if you ask me, I would buy it. I think it's worth it."
1,No explanation needed...,"This review will wrote itself. I'm just giving it 1 star to lower the average. No further explanation is needed for this piece of turd! Buy ""Train of Thought"" by Dream Theater instead."
5,Faultless rap-rock perfection,"i feel that Significant Other is just fantastic from start to finish. i think that it was good for Limp Bizkit to start changing there style, because TRUE artists don't constantly repeat there same sound over and over again on each album. they evolve and experiement with new musical styles despite what all the fans stuck in the past think. i highly recommend this album.10/10"
1,Death to Rap Rock Bands!!!,This junk is garbage. I can't believe it gets played on rock radio. Pathetic lyrics as well. It's just white boy hip hop with guitars being poorly played in the background. Time for the return of REAL rock n' roll!!!
1,Ack !!!!!!! what iz dis Grabage?,"People who like this garbage must be sniffin sumthin pretty heavy or they need to replace their hearing aid. havent people figured out that fred durst is the worst rapper i have ever heard, he doesnt talk bout much except fo his smart girlfriend who left him. He will never step to the level of great rappers like c-loc, e-40 & scarface or ever to the level of great rock bands like korn and pantera"
4,Some people,Some of you old geysers out there need to get a life. This is the kind of music that alot of people listen to these days and I would just like to say that it is a whole lot better than 'NSNYC and the Backstreet Boys. The only good thing about any music besides heavy metal and shock rap is Britney Spears and Chrostina Auguleura.
1,ALbum sucks!,I bought this album about a month ago. Know i cant stand to hear the name Limp Bizkit! They suck. Freds lyrics are the most babyish lyrics on the earth! I hate this cd so much i cracked it in half! Kid Rock is 100 times better!
5,Not what you expect,"I heard this CD and it shocked me, where is the old Limp? Does it really matter? This CD is just as good , if not better than the first. Every band changes and grows and wants to do more. They still are true to their roots but do things a little different. I think their fan base will open up with this CD. This is a great CD, a must for Limp fans and a should get for music fans."
3,NOT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST ONE,"I don't think this cd is half of what Three Dollar Bill Y'all was. I like SO because its the type of cd that you can listen to every song, but they're too rappish, and the songwriting is not good. I mean how many rip-offs are there on SO? Quite a few. If you want metal, buy Korn or the deftones, they have more talent, can write songs, and don't have as much rap."
1,They wouldn't let me put 0 stars.,My god....BRUTAL...bizkit sucksIf you want a blend of both worlds with actual meaning full lyrics that are the perfecdt blend listen to RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE.
4,this cd rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"yo!yo!do you like to play with yo yo's? Huh, huh, do ya??? Well then you'll love this CD yo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! limp bisquite ruuuuuuleeees!at the tone of my voice say yo yo yo yo do you like the limp bisquite cd yo yo!! huh huh dontcha no me like ya know yo yo yo mammmma? peace yo outie!!!!"
2,Limp Bizkit is overhyped,"I heard limp Bizkit first when i saw the Sour video and i thought it was awesome so i bought 3 dollar bill and i was all good then they come out with a second cd and what the hell happened there's only 3 good song's on the new cd ""break stuff"", ""nookie"" and n2 gether now. Korn, Deftones, Slipknot and Pennywise are a lot better."
1,i am embarrased to own this cd,"this cd blows a fat one. come on 3$bill was hundreds of times better than this. in the first album he would yell get your adrenaline flowing and make you wanna break stuff. is that song (break stuff) supposed to heat you up and make smoke come out the ears? the cd sounds too perfect, clear clean, doesnt mess up once mint condition junk. go buy RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE for some metal rap"
1,limp is right!,"limp bizkit is a powerful force in music today...so instead of writing negative and derogatory lyrics, why doesn't this obviously powerful band try to make a difference with our youth? i especially dislike how their lyrics degrade women...i can't believe they even have a female fan base...i hope all you young girls out there wake up and run like hell from men like these..its painfully obvious that any bad relationships that durst has had with women in the past, he is now taking out on all women...its really too bad fred, because you and your boys have alot of talent...too bad you didn't use it for good"
2,Nookie not bad but the album as a whole is bad,"Ahhh....limp bizkit the newest form of a once decaying form of music.... metal scince around 92 has been lifeless untill this new recent form of metal like Korn and Limp bizkit comes along. a breath of fresh air.. the album takes a more melodic turn for the band and some songs are decent enough to hear twice. the style of rap and rock intermixing is no longer an original form. now it has become mainstream, as limp bizkit has truly made it. bands like Anthrax and Aerosmith were pioneers in that sense of the crossover, and limp just made it acceptable. Significant other is better than there first and hopefully the band will get progressivly better as musicians, but i dont forsee that anytime soon. keep practicing guys you will someday know how to play the guitar. ohh and another thing......I do it all for the nookie"
2,Rearranged deserves note,"Frankly, I hate the recent rock/rap bands that have cropped up. Well, Limp definitely falls into this catagory.I, however, was surprised to see a bit of musical inspiration amongst the haze. Rearranged is really a marvelous song. Definitely not worth the price of the album, but worth noting nonetheless."
3,not bad,"not a bad cd. it could have been better. I like the idea of rap/rock, but there was too much rock not enough rap."
1,?,Is this what music has came to? Fred Durst has no musical talent at all. The same god damn riff over and over again in each song. There music gives me a head ache. You want musical talent? Buy Nirvana or something with lyrics that wherent writen by a five year old. ( I had to give it one star they wouldnt let me give it 0)
3,Has only a couple good songs.,This is an ok cd but the thing is it only has 2 good songs on it the rest are not the greatest songs in the world.
4,what a way to piss off your parents!,This album is a great one to listen to when you want to thrash your room. Its loud catchy beats will be stuck in your head forever. Those of you out there who gave this 1 pathetic star need to get out of your wimpy shell and experiance some good music. live a little.
5,This CD Rocks,The CD rocks it is the best Hard Rock CD out except for KoRn's Follow the Leader. This CD shows the true meaning of Rock.
4,The bizkit is going limp,"WHATS UP FRED, WHAT HAPPENED TO THE YELLING AND HARD QUITAR RIFFS. I WISH THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE SONGS LIKE TRUST AND BREAK STUFF, BUT THIS IS A GOOD CD."
4,Pretty Good,You either really like the songs or hate them. I found it hard to get through some of the songs but I also pressed repeat many times. If you like rock/rap this is great. good music and the lyrics are decent. Worth the 13 bucks paid for it.
5,This is a most PHAT album!!! The band just flows immensely!,"Hey what up cyber-junkies. Biz Limp Kit is just soaring off the charts w/ their new found fan base. I think it's great how they can so easily follow an album like ""3 Dollar Bill Yall$."" It's a great album. Go get it if you already haven't. Piece."
2,Not as good as 3 dollar bill y'all,"I heard Nookie on Mtv and really liked it. I bought the CD and hoped that I would find at least another good song. I was really wrong. All I heard was the F-word and every other cuss used in every other sentence. The lyrics are TERRIBLE, execpt for Nookie. Hopefully they'll do better. If I were you, listen to it on the radio but skip the CD."
1,Terrible,Just plain terrible. No lyrical content. No presence of music.Saying anything more would be a waste of my time and your's.
3,Not the best but still damn good,"this wuz my first limp bizkit album. i think it kicks ass, if you want to get into limp bizkit then start with this album. Either this or choclate startfish. Forget what people say about limp bizkit an just sit back an enjoy."
4,This CD was an exception,"I usually don't buy Rock CDs. The last rock CD I bought was Third Eye Blind. I mostly buy R&B and Rap CDs, but Nookie was OFF THE HOOK! So I decided to take a chance on this album and it was worth the money! My favorite songs are ""Nobody Like You,"" ""I'm Broke,"" ""Break Stuff,"" ""Just Like This,"" ""Nookie,"" ""9 teen 90 nine,"" ""N 2 Gether Now"" and the hidden song with Matt Pinfield is GOOFY."
2,Following in the footsteps of Follow the Leader,"this cd was crap... limp bizkit almost sold out as much as korn. this cd was made for the masses (MTV, pop fans, etc.) and not the real Limp Bizkit fans. I first heard Nookie and expected something decent but I ended up with softcore crap comparable to Backstreet Boys. And what's up with Show Me What You Got? Doesn't even compare to Cambodia. Cambodia is my all time favorite song and the re-make made me sick, it sums up my whole feeling on the album. Stop blindlessly accepting what MTV feeds to you and go out and buy some real metal music not cheap pop. I welcome discussion."
3,so-so,"umm two words: sell out- ok Im probably being too harsh but I liked 3 dollar bill alot better- well now they're getting alot of MTV and radio airtime theres a billion teenyboppers running out to buy the cd- its a mediocre at best cd- not much innovation here- dont get me wrong its not bad- its nice to listen to while driving- but if you really like limp= not just ""faith"" ""nookie"" and ""re-arranged"" then get 3 dollar bill yalls- significant other now has a place in my little sisters CD rack rite next to Brittany Spears and Ricky Martin. Viva Limp Bizit. =)"
2,Their next album was better. This one had lame lyrics.,"Significant Other had good songs, but lame stuff. Nookie is still their strongest record. It sounds like the drummer was barefooted when he hit the drums in the song. But there are some flat numbers like Rearranged. The pace of the song is BORING! Good groove, but a very boring pace sometimes. A few times, I went to sleep when I heard the song. There seems to be an '80s feel in some of the songs and Fred Durst's raps tend to range from normal to offensive to outlandish. They stick to the same song formula, rapid pace, then a slow breakdown before their big crashing endings. But the lyrics are corny and flat in some places. Even some of the song titles sound stupid. So I just don't see this as their breakthrough. Just don't see it."
4,"More hard than ""Limp"".","Remember in 1999 when these guys were everywhere and seemed inescapable? It was mostly because of what's on ""Significant Other"". Not only was it released at the peak of their popularity, but it's also probably their best album. It's full of great tracks, including the aggressive ""Break Stuff"", ""Re-Arranged"", and the monster hit ""Nookie"", but songs like ""Show Me What You Got"" and ""Just Like This"" rock as well. The days when ""Kid Rock"", ""Korn"", and ""Limp Bizkit"" ruled the earth may be over, but you can still throw on this disc and remember how much fun it was."
1,no melody and no atmosphere,My friends have tried to get me to like this album but its not possible. They seriously lack any atmosphere or melody and I think Limbonic Art and Ephel Duath are way better. Please stop that horrible guitar sound and the vocalist is so condesending its painful.
4,"Okay, as far as im concerned","This cd is okay. But with the data track, it crashes my computer a few times before it works on my computer. But it includes Videos and 2 versions of Break Stuff. Otherwise, no different from the U.S cd. This really isnt as good as the first album, three dollar bill yall$. The music is a little softer this time, and there is more rap in it."
2,eh...,"when i first got this cd, i listened to it a lot. but then, after a while, i really started to hate it. and if you think about it, it's just rap rock. it gets old too fast. buy something heavier and just plain better like KORN, COAL CHAMBER, or SLIPKNOT. i'd pass on this one."
1,a good frisbee!,"Limp Bizkit's second album,they shouldn't even have made a first.I used to be able to handle Nookie, but know that song is so stupid.Avoid this garbage,it's worse the NKOB or Hammer."
1,thanks a lot limp,"Thanks to them we got wiggers everywhere. Just look at that cover. The idealized wigger strutting his stuff, rappin with the best of the blacks out in DA STREETS. This is pathetic in every possible way. This isn't music, it's a way to look tuff n cool. Just like all hip hop."
1,Oooooh how emotional !,"This is typical of what passes as cathartic music for a lost generation these days and American kids can't wait to lap it up. You don't have to wave your arms around and make those growly noises to channel your emotions, just write something for once without thinking of how you're gonna look when you perform it on stage. Come on kids, buy this record and then get some of those cool 'sinister' contact lenses as well, you're sure to impress everyone !"
4,?????,"this record is a not a favorite of mine but features other artistes who have been a influence to the music industry but seriously this band has talent but their lead singer is a wussy person c'mon atleast try to math what Rage Against The Machien has done but they have to have a DeeJay , compare them to Rage t. Rage's lead guitarist use his own guitar and hands to make incredible noises like what the turntables do . Limp Bizkit is bit more rap then rock . in rock your supposed to scream out the top of your freaking lungs but this bands are melodic and rap focused band . it was a good thing for wes borland to leave the band cause the band was going no where but being stupid . with their new guitarist , Limp Bizkit has gone down teh drain and never will rise up again . without Borland there are nothingBring the heat from the revolution of Rage . the only band that is a close match to Rage is System Of A Down . but Slipknot are the godfathers of the current Nu-Metal industry"
1,"yo, kids! get yo nookie somewhere else","hey, you dont need to buy this album. I know your age or IQ probably hovers around the area of 11-12 you dont have to buy this. I know this was trendy a couple years ago, and as of now limp bizkit is dead (how were they alive in the first place) but a lot of ""cool"" kids are still listening to this album. there are tons of other smart bands out there, dont spend a dollar on limp bizkit. its not just not my thing, it shouldnt be anyones thing. fred durst is perhaps the worst ""singer"" I have ever heard in my entire life. he has this high pitched little girly yelp thing going on when he isnt makin gurgley sounds on totally cool, extreme songs like 'break stuff'!! and his band...wow. yeah, i know the ramones made a career on three chords...but that isnt going to work for limp bizkit.how limp bizkit tricked a couple million people into buying their album is beyond me. but they should give this music thing up."
5,Good CD,"Limp Bizkit really produced a good album here. This is the REAL Bizkit. Songs like Nookie (which is arguably the best song produced by Limp Bizkit)and Break Stuff lay down Limp Biskits style. The lyrics are better than 3 dollar bill and Chocolate Whatever. More personal sounding. This group rocks.I also heard that Wes Borland sucks at guitar becuase he has no technique. I don't care about technique, and I dont care about technique cuz its what it sounds like that matters. You don't WATCH Wes Borland play guitar when you listen to the album so who cares? It just sounds good. I would recomend this CD over the other two. It is more solid then the rest and is true LB style."
5,CHILD APROPRIATE!!,"This is the BEST cd from Limp Bizkit yet! YOu can't even tell that they cuss they did such a good job on bleeping out. IF you are one of those parents who don't want there kids listening to bad music this cd is ok. I am a parent of a teenager, and this Cd is apropriate."
3,A little dissapointing but not ''sell-outs'',"Why doesn't Fred Durst do what we like best? Hear him scream about tormented relationships and complain about how much his life sucks? Sure, he does it a little on this album, but he has to sing melodic. It would be fine, but he cant sing. Three Dollar Bill Yall is much better at showing his fans what we want. Which is a full-fledged rap-metal outlet. Significant Other doesnt fail, it just keeps you waiting and searching for something more heavier. It is little more darker than Three Dollar Bill Yall. But, there are some light moments (like the Method Man rap). Get Three Dollar Bill Yall$ it is better"
4,Something to try.....,"This CD is a little schizo to say the least. I really enjoy it and it fits any mood you happen to be in when you want to crank it. ""Rearranged"" is the most articulate, ""N2Gether Now"" is the funniest, ""Trust?"" and ""9 teen 90 nine"" are my personal favorites b/c they have great beats and lyrics. it gets a little raw at times but overall it's enjoyable. Fred Durst is a talented man who should continue to explore this type of rap/rock! Check it out if you want something different, but it would waste your time if you like straight-up thrash rock."
1,Crap,"Well,it is.Fred Durst is a horrible singer,plus a total (...).The turntables don't really fit with any of the songs,and this is Nu-metal!The guitars are ok,not the greatest thing ever,I know Wes could play better,but,when you play in a bad band you mkae bad msuic I guess.The bass and drums aren't anything at all,they sucks."
1,This should be banned off the Earth!,"This is not metal at all. This is a travesty to metal. This is pimp\jock\lowlife rock. Limp Bizkit's music is the most immature music that I have ever heard in my life. No heart, no soul, no intelligence, and no talent. It sickens me that some 30 year old fool from the trailer park is trying to be 16 and use cuss words to gain popularity. I couldv,e written those lyrics when I was in kindergarden. This is not rap either. Real rap is street. This is nothing but suburbia garbage for the brainless mallrats of America. The music itself is nothing feel proud about. Two chord noise that sounds worse than screeching a chalkboard is enough to make me want to turn off this CD at about three seconds upon starting. All that these fools are doing are trying to get a seal of approval by MTV and make a buck or two on the spoiled youth of America."
3,Check Out Their Other 2 cds,"2 much rap, not enough hardcore stuff. That's just what it about comes down to. I'll give a brief summary on every song to let you know""Just Like This""- Very cool. One of few highlights on this cd ""Nookie""- Unbelievably awesome. I still find myself singing the chorus. ""Break-Stuff""- Sweet lyrics, cool guitars. ""Re-Arranged""- Kinda boring, yet in a way fun to listen to. All the other songs on ""Significant Other"" suck. Get Limp Bizkit's new album instead, Ya'll."
2,second thoughts,well..................... i used to think it was good. I gave it 2 stars because i like 2 songs-break stuff and rearranged well this is what happends when you go mainstream. Break stuff will remain one of my favroite songs though
4,Exceeded my expectations,"I was never a big Limp Bizkit fan until I heard ""Nookie"" and I liked the song so much I bought the album. Fred Durst can actually sing and the guitar riffs on this disc are amazing. For a sophomore album I am definetly impressed. The Intro and Outro have a really cool beat and the words are pretty funny also. Even if you aren't a big hard rock fan, you'll probably like this cd so buy it."
2,If I wanted rap I would Buy Snoop Dog!,This new cd is just not comparable to the first one don't waste your money on it. It has to much rap and to much singing. The man can not sing! He needs to start screeming more(thats what he's famous for after all). The rap on the other cd is fine its not to much but this time they pushed way to far. Don't count on me buying this cd!(I listened to one of my friends copy) I hope they read things like this and will realize to go back to the sound of Three Dollar Bill.
2,This is Limp Bizkit????,"I can't believe this is Limp Bizkit. This is THE most trendy piece of garbage I've heard since ""Follow the Leader"". It seems that Limp Bizkit has followed the leader into the cesspool of trendy teenbopping hip hopping rock. Thank god for the Deftones. They'll never sell out and become corporate rock bands."
4,the best limp bizkit record to date,"Limp Bizkit's new release ""Significant Other"" has to be their best album so far. With songs like ""Nookie"" and ""9 teen 90 nine"", you can't go wrong. Fred Durst adds his special touch to an already fantastic lineup. Wes Borland once again shows his powers with the trusty axe. DJ Lethal continues to mix in his own ""House"" of fun. And this crap just continues. This cd is the best cd and a must buy for all die hards and newbies alike. Enjoy the kick ass music that they keep pumping, cause it's real, and won't ever stop. It is truly Limp Bizkit's ""Significant Other""."
5,AWESOME,"This CD was an awesome mix of rap and rock. With all those catchy lyrics like ""I did it all for the nookie"", or ""It's just one of those days when you don't wanna wake up, everyone's ....."""
5,"Excellent CD, too bad they released weak Choc. Starfish","This CD is just a perfect example of a band making an excellent CD like this and following it up with a (bad) CD. This CD is an excellent CD with many great songs.""Nookie"", ""Break Stuff"", and ""Show Me What You Got"" are awesome shout along anthems, ""Re-Arranged"", ""Don't Go Off Wandering"", ""No Sex"" are songs with great meanings, and ""I'm Broke"", ""Nobody Like You"", and ""Trust"" are great alt-rock songs.""Just Like This"" and ""N 2 Gether Now"" are weak, but that's about it. If you got Choc. Starfish, hated it and don't have Significant Other, give Limp another chance, try this."
4,GIVE ME SOMETHING TO BREAK!,"Significant Other is a an enjoyable album, as long as you are not too critical of it. Sometimes Freds rapping gets annoying, but not enough for me to call this a bad album. ""Just Like This"" is a great rock/hiphop song, followed by the 2 best songs, ""Nookie"" (I did it all for the...) and ""Break Stuff."" There are also some more mellow songs on here, most of which are good (ReArranged, No Sex, Dont Go Off Wandering). There are only a few songs I dont like, ""N 2 Gether Now"" is really annoying in my opinion. But overall this album is worth your money, as long as your not too critical and just try to enjoy it."
3,I did it all for the Wookie,"Who wants to bet the title above will be on the next Weird Al album? I can already see him dressed in Han Solo garb for the video!Limp Bizkit has arrived -- albeit with a few tracks that trod aimlessly into Everlast territory. Fred, save the introspective stuff for your post-rehab career."
5,SWEET!!!,The limp is back in action. They are the best!!! There unedited version is definately better though. Limp Bizkit is the best!!!
1,?????????????,"I thought that 3 dollar bill showed some promise but had a lot of boring and annoying songs on it. This album is 100 times worse. The lyrics are the most ridiculous things in the world. How long it took him to come up with the ""I should have kept my pants on"" line? This CD has a few good moments, such as tracks 2,3, and 5. Other than that, it's a piece of trash. Fred Durst can't rap. He's not funny. He cannot sing. And last but CERTAINLY not least, he seems deadset on putting down the radio and commercial music, of which he is right in the middle of. What a hypocrite. I'm so angry that I wasted my money. Les Claypool is right."
1,"Please, let me rate less than one star!","Before you go out and waste your hard earned money on this piece of garbage, ask yourself one question. Am I a next generationer? If you said yes, than I would say go out and buy it. If you are the rest of the world who said ""no"", than stay away from this CD, screaming people, and everything else that says Limp Whatever they're called. Somebody else said that they aren't even a band. What were the record companies thinking? I know exactly what they were thinking. They were thinking that a bunch of braindead teenagers would definatly go and buy this piece of junk. They were exactly right because a bunch of teens came and bought it. I have one question for anybody who likes these people: what are you on? Seriously!"
1,This stuff just plain stinks,"Twenty years from now, all of these 5-star reviews will look pretty silly.Oh wait, they look silly already."
3,Not at all like KORN,"After their first album, ""3 dollar bill y'all,"" I had to get this. Needless to say, I was disappointed. Is this the same band that played Pollution, Counterfeit, and Stuck??? Sure, the album has its high points-in Nookie, Break Stuff, and in Show me what you got. I thought that limp bizkit was rap-core, not ghetto rap. Why the hell would Method Man play with them on N 2 Gether Now??? Also, Re-Arranged is below average along with a lesson learned. Some tracks, previously mentioned are really cool(also check out I'm broke and Just like this) Do yourselves a favor and DONT compare this to Korn!! Korn is heavy metal, while Limp Bizkit is slowly becoming white rap with some screaming and loud bass. I compare Bizkit to Kidrock in some ways(and I hate Kidrock) For all of you posers that write in and say this is the best album, I have a question for you. Did you listen to the CD? I was one of the biggest limp bizkit fans, but they completely SOLD OUT."
1,Limp Bizkit is Limpin'... Bad...,"Limp Bizkit is not a good band. Pure and simple. If I have to hear another one of Fred Durst's songs of craptacular badness then I will have to go up to him personally and kick his (...).This album lacks creativity, is nothing but computerized garbage, and is starving for attention. What it is good at is sucking and blowing, neither of which I'm a fan for.If you have half a brain, let alone half a brain cell, it will tell you not to buy this album but rather to steal it and burn it in a ritualistic like fashion. Limp Bizkit deserves to be slapped in the face a million times for this.I wish that Limp Bizkit would just stop with this silly charade and try to make music for once, maybe it will be good for a change. Either that, or they will probably be even worse, take your pick."
5,One line huh???? LIMP BIZKIT IS BETTER THAN EVERYONE!!!,"To all of you so called ""fans"" of Limp Bizkit that caught on when they heard faith, get a grip this is the real Limp Bizkit and it's here to stay this is truely the best album and will blow away 3 dollar bill."
1,"""Music for Illiterate Apes...""","...is how Limp Bizkit has been described, and that pretty much hits the nail on the head. Durst & co. mainly appealed to beer-addled frat rats and p___ed off 14 year old skate rats. Do yourself a favor, and check out some good music, like Mr Bungle, Firewater, Phylr, or Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. ""Break Stuff?"" Why not start with the Limp Bizkit CD's in your collection."
1,The Bizkit is Limp,"Turgid, whiny, childish, badly written, craply produced, boring, three chord riffs, AWFUL vocals and very repetitive. In the words of the great Zakk Wilde: ""Limp Bizkit still suck!"" and indeed they do!"
2,It gets old,"Now if I would have rated this 5 years ago I would have easely givin it a 5.But after about 8 monthes of it being out you relize that there are only about 3 good songs on it.I DO NOT hate limp bizkit,I just feel there other 3 are much better."
5,One of the best albums ever recorded,"Let me start off by saying anyone who doesn't like Limp Bizkit won't like this review and everyone that talks bad about them, stop being jealous. Limp Bizkit is my favorite band. I've liked them ever since i heard the song ""Nookie"" on MTV back in 1999. Since then I've been hooked. I have all there albums and can honestly say this is there best one. I can sit back and listen to every song on the album and enjoy myself. They mix up genres and make it sound great from the rap on ""N2gether Now"" to the hard rock on ""Break Stuff"" all the way to the soft rock singing on ""Re-Arranged"". Fred Durst does an excellent job on vocals here. The entier band does an excellent job. Not dissing the rest of the band but I think their Bass Player, Sam Rivers, is their biggest star. Aside from that all of them are very talented and this is their best work. This album is a must buy no matter what music you like you will enjoy this."
2,Over my head,"I honestly can't figure out, what's all the hype behind LB about. For example, let's take the megahit ""Nookie"". It could actually been written by any wanna-be-crossover-king-type of ""musician"". So Fred, PLEEEEase go home and grow up."
5,"Awsome cd, cool songs, great lyrics!",This cd is the best and one of my favorite cds ever. The best songs are reranged and nookie. Limp Bizkit is one of my all time favorite groups today and everybody should run out and go get this cd.
4,Good album from Limp,"Limp Bizkit comes forth with another good album. A few of the tracks on here were all over radio airplay around when this became released and it has a few classic tracks on here as well. The album starts off very strong but loses a little a bout a third of the way through. There are songs to get you pumped up and have very strong beats, while a few are more relaxed and deeper type of songs. There are a few skippable ones, but for the most part it is a good album and a must have for fans.#2 - 10 (classic)#3 - 9.5#4 - 10 (classic that'll make you wanna break stuff)#5 - 9#6 - 8#7 - 6.5#8 - 6.5#9 - 5#10 - 9 (f/ Method Man)#11 - 7.5#12 - 7.5#13 - 8#14 - 2check all my reviews"
1,AWFUL,"""Significant Other"" is a terrible record. The song writing is pathetic, the guitar work is sloppy and amateruish. Fred Durst is nothing more than a Vanilla Ice with an edge. Limp Bizkit is just another MTV driven band with no talent. They have yet to have a hit that they wrote themselves. This album defines pathetic."
4,It's just one of those days,"Limp Bizkit is awesome. Since viewing last year's VMA awards, I bought ""Three Dollar Bill, Y'All"" and then bought ""Significant Other"". Now I own ""Chocolate Starfish and The Hot Dog Flavored Water"". I have all 3 of their CD's, and 2 Limp Bizkit T-shirts. Notable tracks on this include Intro, Nookie, and Break Stuff. It's just one of those days! LIMP BIZKIT, SISQO, KORN, KID ROCK, PAPA ROACH, RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS, 3 DOORS DOWN...THEY ALL RULE THE WORLD!!! BUY THIS CD IF YOU'RE A FAN OF ROCK AND EXPLICIT LYRIC-FEATURING SONGS!"
1,Why settle for less?,"Limp Bizkit may have a catchy tune here and there, but why settle for less? Limp Bizkit, Fred Durst, has no vocal talent and the hip-hop-rock conglomeration is done all wrong. They don't have any style or suavity, they merely mesh the two styles together into a crude, boring, intellectual-less and (low i.q) appreciative style. The tunes are just noise, with no form in any way and Fred Durst has an identity crisis. He thinks he's black but he isn't. His futile attempts to seek other artists to abet his record, displays the depravity and overwrought nature of the band. If you want a REAL hip-hop-rap-metal fusion, then turn to RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE, the best of the rap-rock confluence. Limp bizkit doesn't have any talent and their popularity is just based on insipid idiotic masses of the nation (namely teenagers) who do not know how to distinguish a quality rock/rap from junk music."
1,I thought the album was ALOT worse than the 1st one,"I really liked Three Dollar Bill Y'all, but Signifigant Other is just plain terrible. I really expected more from the band than this! It's a shame too because i was really looking forward to this one."
4,"Awesome, for the most part.","Limp Bizkit rocks, and it always will! But not every song was as great as Nookie. 'Nookie' and 'Break Stuff' are awesome!"
1,God this is trash!,"I can't believe this kind of garbage that is so popular today. These artists not only have no talent instrumentally, but they make it even worse with the inclusion of rap! I have heard ""Nookie"" and a few others, and in my opinion they are downright awful! You may think that I am an adult, but in actuality, I am a 16 year old. Someday this horrible genre of music will die, and the world will become safe once again. Please invest in some Doors, or Zeppelin, or Pink Floyd, but don't buy LIMP BIZKIT!"
3,Don't know what to think...,"Nookie is a good tune. But the band and their videos are sooo artficial, sooo over-produced and sooo MTV-ish. That guitar guy with the white painted face, come on, give us a break. But maybe the 13-15 year old skateboard kids like that kind of trash."
2,Not Near as good as their first cd,"The only reason people are buying this cd is because of the song NOOKIE, well people let me tell you now that is the only good song on this cd. The first one, Three Dollar Bill Y'all, is way better thatn this one!!!"
3,Sort of A Disapointment,"When I heard LB's 1st album 3 Dollar Bill Y'all, I was impressed with the way they blended grinding metal with hip-hop. I enjoyed it. Then I picked up Significant Other and was a little disapointed. I mean I think they rushed this album even though it still took them 2 years. I mean there are some good metal songs on there such as, ""Break Stuff"", ""Nobody Like You"" and ""9 teen 90 nine"" and ""Show Me What You Got"" and ""I'm Broke"". I like the song ""Nookie"" as well. But what made me mad was the way they try to go all rap with Method Man. I didn't like that at all."
5,Limp Bizkit is the best!!!!!!!,This cd is the best.I'm so hooked. I would give it 6 stars if I could. If u don't like Limp Bizkit u shouldn't be here!
4,"Great CD, but not as hardcore as it could have been","The CD is great. My favorite songs are Nobody Like You, Break Stuff, 9 Teen 90 Nine, Trust?, N 2 Gether Now, and No Sex. The collaboration with Method Man was great. However, i would have thought this cd would be heavier, or at least as heavy as 3DB. For hardcore metal, buy 3DB. For melody and great beats, buy Significant Other. For some great music, buy them both. The only reason this cd didn't get 5 stars is because of Lesson Learned. I hate that song!!"
5,this cd is the best cd I've ever listend to,every song is exalent. I think it is the best cd for the decade.
1,Kids dont listen,That's right. This is a number1 filth in the first degree.He better go find a Burger King to work at. He is not ina million year's gonna amountto nothing.
3,should i buy this cd?,i not too sure if i should buy this cd or not. is this cd any good or is it pure trash? you people tell me if i should buy this cd.
1,these guys should be banned,"this durst dude should be ashamed for putting down his hometown of jacksonville, florida! you should always remember your roots dude, because if it weren't for the people in your hometown you guys would not be where you are today! shame on you! do more for the artists in jax who are struggling to make it in the industry and maybe, just maybe you can redeem yourself!"
4,great album from an underdeveloped group,"LB as a group seems VERY underdeveloped. For example it seems as if Fred Durst's voice was given an ""electric"" effect which was probably done to give the tracks some more substance. The rhymes are primitive. This is definitely apparent when Fred raps alongside Method Man on ""N 2 Gether now"" who rips up the track and leaves Durst in the dust. Also, the lyrics are very immature and drab.So why did I give this album 4stars? I'm pretty much a hip-hop & techno fan, so I have to say that I'm impressed with the beats and baselines on tracks 2,3,5, and 13. Must be DJ Lethal (who IS the group's secret weapon). These tracks were JUST AMAZING! Driving and pumping the volume on these tracks is an awesome experience. LB's energy and enthusiasm is their main hook. And I like this CD even though I'm not a white, suburban teenager..."
5,Limp bIZKIT KICKS a**,tHIS IS AN AWSOME CD. iF YOU LIKE THE COMBONATION OF RAP METAL. you will love this cd it really kicks a**!!!! me and my friend jay hoss seen them live at louisville and they rocked the mother f***** house!!! if you ain't got this cd get it fool! three dollar iz even better!!!!!!!!
5,Limp Bizkit is awesome,I bought this CD for Break Stuff and Nookie but all the songs are awesome buy this Cd right now!
3,"Okay, but not the best.","Nookie, break stuff, no sex, and I'm broke are great(not to mention Matt Pinfield cutting down todays music). The rest either suck or are very annoying. Only buy if you are a big Limp fan."
1,Terrible,Limp is right !! Limp Bizkit is a group that doesn't know what genre they want to be . They are sooooo messed up its scary . if you want to listen to a white guy who can rap a million times better than Fred Durst buy Eminems new album . If you must have a rock/rap melded together thing get one of Rage Against the Machine's albums . The lyrics and music are so crude and uncreative I wonder what the music induntry has turned into . Not even a guest appearance by KoRn's Jonathan Davis could save this sinking album . Don't buy it . The edited version is just as bad because the music s*cks . I gave it 1 star because i couldn't give it 00 .
4,This is a must-have for both rock and rap fans alike,"I'm not the biggest rock fan in the world but I love rap. Limp Bizkit makes a steady blending of rap and rock with the hardcore rock riffs and rap lyrics. My favorite song on the album is ""n 2gether now"" featuring Method Man from my favorite rap group the Wu-Tang Clan. That is my favorite song but most of them are good. Another song worth checking out is ""Just Like This"". I recomend this album to rap fans who sometimes like to bang their heads and get rowdy. I also can recomend this to any rock fan because these guys can play!"
2,Leave it on the shelf!,"This cd is nothing compared to their first album. Fred Durst hit a bunt on this one yall. The only song I can give some props to is the track with Method Man. The rest of the songs are duds. No doubt this cd is for the population not the real limp fans. I was offended to hear the soft beats and ""significant"" decline in bass quitar. All in all, try to find Three Dollar Bill."
2,Where did the hard edge go?!?!?,"What did they do to their music? Where is that raw hard edge sound that made the band popular on their first CD. I was so disappointed when I heard this new album. I loved their first album because of its energy, power, and raw metal sound along with Fred's unique style of screaming and whining. But they lost it...they sound like they're trying to become a rap group rather than a hip hop/metal band. Its not a terrible CD, I've heard much worse. Its worth checking out to make your own opinion but I think they're making a big mistake with this change."
5,Limp is a legend in the making,"The band with the limp, and the bizkit is back and rocking the amp, now there new single ""Nookie"" is hot, and a couple of hot singles ""Nobody like you"" has cameos on it from KoRn frontman Jon Davis, and STP frontman Scott Weiland and the very hilarous secert songs ""Radio Sucks"" with a verbal assualt on the radio today, and a little wacky adventure into the mind of Les Claypool on the track ""Mind of Les"", well that is all for me, get set for a tour two see both Limp, and KID ROCK!!!!"
1,Pretty pathetic,"The singer is just full of himself amoung other things. The musicians think they're great but really are pretty mediocre. They could learn a few things by paying better attention to Rage. For rap, I'm sticking to Dre & Snoop Dogg."
3,great cd,"I first heard nookie and couldnt get the hook out of my head for months,so i bought the cd,i played it nonstop for about 1 month and tripped on x while driving and the music took me out there.I still aint came back.But after a while,i got tired of hearing this guy wine about his girl problems.I sometimes wanted to drive off a cliff.So i popped in Too $horts cd to bring me back to reality.But its worth the money"
1,The Real Evaluation on the Limp Bizkit Cd,"This album is no good at all. Limp Bizkit has potential to become a great speed metal bad, but this album proves a high failure. The album has tasteless cheap rap mixed with pieces of heavy metal music that are great, but just pieces ! You know the band has a cool name, it reminded me of a band of the eighties called Laaz Rocket- Fred Durst has to improve in feeling the light when it comes to singing. The only thing good about this album is the front cover with the kid rapper strutting his stuff, and the band's logo on the Cd, and that is it. Limp Bizkit should write music and songs that compare to Ice T's Cop Killer, and with the great heavy metal rhythms that Overkill plays on their albums.{a heavy metal band-and a respected one}. If you want an album that has cheezy music with no effort at all buy this album, but if your looking for an album that has great music, and vocals, buy another album."
5,This Album rules,This album rules and Fred Durst is hot I love the song nookie and re-arragnged and i love the song nobody like you. LIMP BIZKIT IS BETTER THEN EVERONE
4,Limpin' their way to Fame,"I hesitated to buy this album at first. The reviews on this site were cloudy and did not help me establish a positive perspective towards this album. I went out and got this album. I must say, it is one of the better albums out there. A few things make this album ""Limp"" from being #1 in my favorite albums list. I would have liked Faith in this album, but thats ok. I worry that this album will die out pretty soon. I love the band, but they have made videos of most of their best songs. Limp Bizkit should leave something for those people who go out and BUY this album. There is still something left, but not as much as if you had boughten the album the day it came out. But I must say, even if I have heard N 2 Gether now like 100 times or more, I still enjoy listening to it. My Final Word: Do you have some spare cash on ya? Go out and buy this album!"
1,HELLO Amazon?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!,"WTH is wrong with Amazon lately. I tried to post 4 reviews and none of them was posted. Also I couldn't see where I got helpful/non-helpful votes. Also I'm starting to get sick of removing reviews for writing improper words. So someone wrote F + U + C + K or C + R + A + P or A + S + S, its not a nuclear assault on Washington for godsake!!Anyway I'm not really gonna review this. I just wanted that someone will see this note so I've decided to take this pile of junk as a victim. No words can describe how horrible it is. And to believe it's not even Limp's worst. Everybody knows Limp Bizkit sucks, I'll just be wasting my time reviewing this.Hit ""YES"" if you agree that Limp Bizkit sucks, otherwise hit ""NO""."
5,i think limp bizkit kicks ass period!!! they rule!!!,limp bizkits music and everything about them kicks ass!!! they rule thats all there is to it but ya need a sample of no sex on here too!
1,music for 11-13 year olds,music for 11-13 year olds of all ages. too weak for metal. too weak for hip hop.please change these kids diapers. they stink
5,Much more mature than $3 bills yall,"I bought this CD not knowing much about Limp Bizkit except that i heard their earier CD and all it was was noise, just plain noise. However, this is alot more melodic and a whole lot better musically...how could you not like Just Like This and Re-Arranged?"
1,Talent?,"If you think this is talent then obviously you've never picked up an instrument before in your life... Gather up a few random people who have just touched their instruments and have them start a band and see. These songs can be learned by anyone in a couple of minutes. However, talent is not the only criterion for being a good band, IMHO. Maybe if a band has at least intelligent lyrics it could make up for lack of talent, but, judging by Limp Bizkit's most popular song that goes ""I did it all for the nookie, so you can take that cookie and stick it in your a$$"" it's quite obvious that not only do they lack talent, but they're a little short in the brains department as well."
1,Absolutely Horrible.. how'd they get a record deal!?!,"I bought this album after hearing rave reviews, seeing their whole interview thing on MTV, and liking the sounds of ""Nookie"". I gave this album a good listen, trying to 'learn' to be a fan of it but I just couldn't do it. This is one of the worst albums I have ever purchased in my life. I'm a big fan of the rap/rock combo but Limp Bizkit does it so poorly on this album that I almost have to give the entire sound of music a 2nd guess.I look forward to seeing what song they release next from this album because there is NO other good song besides ""Nookie"". Not even close. Please do yourself a favor and don't buy this album."
5,THIS ALBUM IS THE BEST THING EVER!,i love the LB! i got a bootleg of the album and its the best thing ive ever heard (except the 1st album) and just like this and no sex rule!
3,"great songs well, most of them","There were a lot of really cool songs, but there were some that didn't really grab my attention. Overall the CD is a great source of entertainment. Though you may like The Hunger more. If you are a huge Limp Bizkit fan and you don't mind a few lousy songs get this CD."
2,Dissappointing,"If you like Nookie and Break Stuff , don't buy this album, thats about as good as it gets. The lyrics are poor. Most tracks seem to have the same tune, different(Crap)lyrics. I reckon you're better off with Blink 182(Old stuff, not as commercial), KoRn, Sevendust (Worth a look('Home'))etc. etc. I could go on all day naming better bands and albums than this. The bottom line is, in simple terms, this is not a good album"
2,this cd is awful.,"I'm glad i'm not the only one let down by this recording. This new ""style"" isn't really a style at all. Not that i could care less about style, it's just that I expected it to be better. Usually the sophomore releases are a lot better. this one bit it. Stay away and get some mr.bungle."
4,"Not as heavy, but bizkit still rocks","There are a lot of great tunes on this album, and I am glad that MTV or radio stations did not play out nookie before the album even came out. Their first one rocked and can't be topped, but this one is still well worth buying!"
4,Why do i like this ALbum?,"I am a big fan of Limpbizkit and i think that the music they make is really a combination of the good parts of rock music (bass line, guitar solo's, etc) and rap music (fast talking, good lyrics, sometime rude but hey its only music). Seeing as i like both styles of music i would give this album 4/5, not perfect but still very cool."
2,3 or 4 ok songs...,"Significant Other got some ok songs like NOOKIE, REARRANGED, JUST LIKE THIS and TRUST...But is really hard to handle with Fred Durst...They got some good rhymes, but most of what he sings is sooooo stupid! The musicians of Limp Bizkit are not bad, but Fred talks too much and say a lot of crap!"
2,"well, it's limp bizkit, therefore, it blows",this cd is such unoriginal excrement that i want to gag myself for wasting my money on it. This cd gets 2 stars for 2 songs: break stuff and 9 teen 90 nine. that's it. those are the only things standing between this review and one with 0 stars. Fred durst is and egotistical ballbiter and the rest of the bands are just unoriginal lackeys. don't even consider it.
1,Buy Endorama by Kreator instead.,"Limb Bizkit is a talentless band, they can't play there instruments and Fred Durst is one of the worst vocalists I've ever heard.Buy Kreator, Dream Theater, Savatage, Love/Hate, Royal Hunt, Blind Guardian, Saxon ,Windowmaker and/or Shadow Galary albums instead."
2,Limp Bizkit - Signigicant Other a Mixed Bag,"Have you heard the Limp Bizkit song ""re-arranged""?If you heard it and liked it, and are considering buying the album because of it -- be advised; don't -- the rest of the album is typical, beastie-boy derived white rap with an extra helping of ""naughty"" words thrown in for good measure.On the other hand, if you heard the song ""nookie"" on the radio, and liked it, then by all means, buy the album! There is lots of crunchy guitar, yelling and syncapated rap. Unfortunatly, even for the ""skater"" in all of us, the album lacks variety (all of the songs sound very similiar, save ""re-arranged""). This album is for kids... whose parents let them listen to explicit lyrics (ick!)."
1,A joke,"Aside from being a laughable, pre-fabbed, made-for-MTV, unoriginal slice of trash, this is a great CD.Then again, if you believe Korn, Limp Bizkit, Rage, etc.. will even be remembered 10 years from now, I have some swampland I'd like to sell you."
1,I'd like to withdraw my eariler comments...,"This album is mediocre garbage. I can now say that Limp Bizkit [stinks]. Yeah, that's right. You may be asking yourself ""Wait, but didn't this guy say this was their best album?"". Well, yes I did. But that was a long time ago and my musical taste and knowledge have matured greatly since then. Anyway, back to this album. It [stinks]. The only Limp Bizkit album I still enjoy is their first one. It was much heavier, more complex, and it was back when Fred Durst wrote meaningful lyrics. Please don't buy this or the even worse ""Chocolate Starfish And The Hotdog Flavored Water"". Buy Three Dollar Bill Yall$ if you have to buy a Limp Bizkit record. Fred Durst has said that for their fourth album, they will go back to their heavy roots. Lets hope so because I don't know how much more of this I can stand."
1,Shut up Already!,"Why is this band so popular? They just took rage against the machine's style (rock with a little rapping) and reversed it (rap with a little rock). First off, Fred's whining vocals have really gotten on my nerves. This band would be better if they didn't have him. Second off, every song on the past two limp bizkit cd's have been about Fred Durst's girlfriend. What a loser. I hope she's happy that 5 guys are getting rich bitching about her. How come I used to like Limp Bizkit and everybody thought I was a loser, and then when this cd came out and they got on MTV, everybody liked them? Whatever. By the way, please get someone else to write lyrics Fred."
1,Don't buy it.,"Hello. i am not going to write one of my normal reviews for this album, seeing as i don't like the band, but used to. All i can really say is that Fred sold out. the music is cool and all, but the person that it's coming from is just stupid. Fred claims to be a reject (as in ""i came into this world as a reject""), but he was the jock in high school that beat you up for being ""gay"". you know, the long hair gay. Wes Borland really shouldn't stay with Bizkit, but if he wants to, he can. But don't support Fred."
1,edited,"aside from the fact that the content of this whole album is drivel, i would like to bring to light the fact that limp 'you-know-what' bizkit has released two albums (significant other and 3dollar bill y'all) also in ""EDITED"" form. Just so all you kiddies know, bands DO have a choice as to release an album where they freely express their art (however stupid it may be) with no censorship. Limp Bizkit has chosen twice to sacrifice whatever integrity they have just so they can put their albums in Wal Mart and other such unconstitutional institutions. They edited their art so that more of you testosterone amped disenchanted american youths could vent your midwest frustrations while they cash in on your inequities. Good work my fellow americans!"
1,Mindless Garbage,"So bad,it's hardly worth talking about...spend your money on some talent (THE BEATLES,PINK FLOYD,LED ZEPP are a few bands that come to mind)."
1,Some wisdom from the mighty Mos....,"""I ain't tryin' to diss, but I don't ph--- with Limp Bizkit. When I get down in my zone, I be rockin' Bad Brains and Fishbone."" -- Mos Def."
1,old fast,"ok people, yes i like limp bizkit. yes i gave it one star. i like OLD limp bizkit, like three dollar bill y'all. but this significant other stuff...i will say that (for a time) it was good. it was pretty good accually, the thing is, when sig. other was released, everyone was expecting a hardcore-rap album, like three dollar bill yall, then when the hit ""nookie"" was released, i thought it was awsome, but it got old, and then otehr hits were released, like ""break stuff"" and ""n 2-gether now"". break stuff is a decent song, but the good stuff , if there is any, are songs like 9 teen ninty 9 and trust? i think are the best stuff. re-arranged was ok, it showed a more mature side to limp bizkit, but who would want a more mature side? this album is [money] down the drain, i bought it, listened to it, then sold it.... it's not worth it...."
1,Simply RESISTABLE!,"Heavy metal rock rappers return for their second run with our money and fail to make it worth while. Though the single ""Nookie"" has a chorus everyone can sink their teeth into, the other singles ""N 2 Gether Now"" and ""Re-Arranged"" fall flat as does the rest of this album's loathsome tracks."
1,damn them all!!!,"F**k these poser ass rejects. Fred Durst more than likely got his ass kicked in high school (now i know why you wanna hate me?!?!?). no talent ass clowns!! hacks!!! never was real metal. terrible trend, glad its over."
1,The New Pollution,"This is not a bad piece of rap-metal. It might have earned about three or so stars for the music (there is certainly better in this genre, but it isn't the worst.)--however, it's too bad Fred Durst is so small minded, homophobic and sexist. It's just like Nirvana never came. Re-arranged isn't half bad(there's actually an element of songwriting.). Nookie has the intensity of the best Rage songs, but the lyrics are so stupid. I don't blame LB for Woodstock '99, but when your fan base is angry teenage boys, what can you expect. Selling a lot of records doesn't earn the respect of anyone whose opinions matter. Motley Crue and Ted Nugent sold a lot of records too."
1,From an appalled listener.,"As it has become painfully obvious to my contemporaries that I only bother to review bands and/or albums that I loathe, I will now launch into a scathing criticism on both this band and this album.This is a bloated and conceited effort at venting, through the eyes of a fourteen year old, the troubles and turmoils of the modern middle-aged man. Surrounded by, if not drowning in, a sea of mediocre musical masturbation, we hear a complacent Durst whinge and whine his way through a maelstrom of real-life issues such as fumbling first sexual experience, anger, hatred, disgust, boobs, girlfriends who cheat and the like.The only reason this album is worth pursuing is the guitarist, and he left, and good on him.I sold this album on the flea market. And like a flea, it is minute, will irritate you, and takes weeks to rid yourself of.I am the dog."
3,"A few good ones, but pretty lame","We've all heard ""Nookie"" and it's hard not to like. ""Break Stuff,"" well, it's alright too. But unfortunately that's about all that worth listening to on this weak offering from Limp Bizkit. Mostly the songs are just noisy rants that you can't understand and, for the most part, aren't even musically appealing. Aside from the unexpected funkiness of the collaboration with Method Man on one of the tracks, this album leaves a lot to be desired. If you're looking for more hard-hitting songs you're better off skipping this one."
1,If only you could give a zero-star review,"The late 1990s were one of the worst times ever for popular music and this CD is from the bottom of the barrel. Limp Bizkit had the crazy idea that all you need to do to sell records is record some awful ""rapping"" over loud guitars and add a lot of swearing to sound tough. Funny thing is - it worked, at least on the business side, and far too many people bought this stuff. This belongs in the used CD bin with releases from Korn, Powerman 5000, Puddle of Mudd and Nickelback."
3,NOT TOO BAD BUT DISAPPOINTING,I thought that this album was pretty disappointing. Don't get me wrong the music isn't bad it's just that I was expecting a heavier more metal album like the first one. I thought the tracks nookie and break stuff were pretty cool though.
5,;nmduishrtuie (like you don't know what that means...),"Oh my good golly hoses, this is a great CD! I don't have it because my parents won't let me get it, but it's still a great CD! I want it! Someone send it to me! I'll give you the money for it. I can't get enough of ""Nookie""!"
2,fred durst needs to rehearse.,"I really don't like limp bizkit that much. it just sounds, well, not good. very little talent here. ""fred durst just need to rehearse, needs to reverse what he's saying. wanna be funkdoobiest while you're playing, rippin' off a band, counterfeit fakin'!""- Korn ""all in the family"" (get korn, they are the best band out there, other than NIN of course, and jon actually has a good voice. you can actually feel emotion in jon's voice, but fred durst just sounds like he's screaming for no reason other than to attempt to sound like korn) you should get these albums: ""the downward spiral- Nine Inch Nails"" ""broken- Nine Inch Nails"" ""pretty hate machine- NIN"" ""Korn(self titled)-KoRn"" ""life is peachy-KoRn"" ""follow the leader-KoRn"" (but if u have to get the bizkit, get significant other, it shows more talent than 3 dollar bill y'all$)"
1,this cd is all rap dammit,i hate rap the first cd was rockin and electric shockin if you want a good cd go buy phunk junkeez.
1,"If you know what's good for you, don't buy this album!","If I'm not mistaken, Limp Bizkit has to be one of the Four Horsemen, contributing to what will amount to the death of tasteful music. Can anyone not see the insipid lyrics, no just on this album, but their entire repetoire to date...and the lack of musical talent displayed by Durst, et al?If you need a song you can remember, then try Adam Sandler's ""Somebody Kill Me..."" from ""The Wedding Singer"" because it pretty much sums up the music industry today and is great for a laugh.""Fight this sickness...find a cure."" Or rather, The Cure...they've never proved me wrong yet, as they were the first band I listened to as a child!A gold star to those followers of Limp Bizkit who even know what song I just quoted in the above paragraph. HINT: It's from The Cure..."
1,you call this music????,"ok...all Limp Bizkit did was take some noisy annoying guitars and a microphone and screamed into it. They can't sing or play guitar good at all. And Fred Durst really annoys me! Isn't he the most ugliest motherf###er you've ever seen? this cd bites the big one, so don't buy it!"
1,society in decay,"the fact that these ""people"" actually have a hit album show's how far we as a society have degenerated,,,,, real garbage here....."
4,The best CD of the summer,"This was probably the best CD investment i've made in years. Not since I bought ""Frogstomp"" from Silverchair has a CD had so many cool songs. The best of course in number 7, which is one of the coolest songs I have I evr heard. The bottom line is if u like Korn or anyone like them this is the CD for u."
4,Great all around CD,"Hey, bizkits got it all:Rap, Rock, metal, and even slow, melodic songs. All around good cd. I gave it a 4 because some lyrics are pretty dumb and annoying esp. when all it seems they're saying are cuss words. My faves are tracks 1-6. The rest of the CD is still pretty awesome. I've got just 2 words for ya: BUY IT!"
5,Significant Other,LB's second album blows away the first one. I thought that the first one was great but this is way better. The songs have less screaming than the first and more melody. Great job for Limp Bizkit.
1,"Example of what shock, with no talent can do",This band is totally amateur hour....Its too bad this generation has nothing better than this garage band to listen to. This is as amateur as it gets
2,I did it all for the what?,"This album is too mature for anyone under 21. The jokes are bad on this album too. Nookie was the only good song on this album, but half the time I didn't understand what Fred Durst was saying. Plus I didn't know what was going on at all in any of the songs. Also Fred Durst is a bad role model. If you want some good music, buy Korn's albums. 3DBY is a much better album, so buy that."
3,hey lighten up !,"It ain't great but it's not as bad as these other reviewers say. I am thirty two years old and I have been following the trends of rock music-not rap-since 1980.This album is the only true rock album of 1999.I know nothing about rap so I can't comment on that aspect of Limp Bizkit.I say stop hanging on to boring old Doors and Led Zeppelin and try something NEW.I like Kid Rock also. By the way,Poison was the worst bubblegum ""metal"" band of sissies ever.Imagine pretty boys IN EYE LINER AND LIPSTICK with big froofy hair. Limp Bizkit would destroy them in a talent contest."
3,Could've been better,"I feel that this album definatley could've been better. I mean it has its sweet spots, but there is also some sour in here. Some examples of the bright spots are "" Just Like This"", ""Nookie"", Break Stuff"", &""Re-arranged"". It's no wonder that these were the singles because they're what keeps this album alive. It all kinda goes downhill from track 6, though. Somehow it almost seems like Limp was tryin' to hard this time. The best stuff they have is the stuff they wrote on the backs of napkens not the stuff they where sat down and said ""Ok, I'm gonna write a song now."" This album just doesn't flow right. For more all around stuff, maybe try KoRn's latest, but for more loud fun and some decent songs ""...Other"" is good enough. I'm glad I bought the CD, but I do wish I had gotten a little more."
4,Step down!,"Alright, I read some of the degrading reviews for this album, and I do have respect for them. I understand that these are opinions, and that's cool with me, but also understand that for lots of people, especially teenagers, if I do say so myself, it's fun, loud, raw music that does, believe it or not, have a message. Yeah, bad-boy lyrics don't necessarily go the mile by themselves, but Limp Bizkit's Significant Other is a CD my friends and I enjoy popping in the CD player now and then, and it's not because of the image. It's because we like it. You're right, it doesn't necessarily have a positive message. But even if Fred Durst has done his fair share of jail time, he's got something to say, just like everybody else. And some of us actually like to listen."
4,Contains songs that will never be forgotten ! ! !,"If this whole album contained songs as good as ""Nookie"", ""Just Like This"", and ""Break Stuff"" I think it would be a contender for being the best metal album of all time. . . But not all the songs are as good as those. The Album starts off ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS, but then gets a little softer (With ""Rearranged""), then became more of a total rap album (With ""N2Gether Now"") then came a whole slur of songs that had good parts here and there, but altogether were obviously a desperate attempt to fill the extra time. For this reason I would give the album about 2 or 3 stars, but ""Nookie"", ""Just like this"", and ""Break Stuff"" are such great songs that this album deserves 4 stares. But if you're the type of person who loves a variety in music styles, it deserves 5 stares. Either way, if you like heavy metal, rap, or soft rock, GET THIS ALBUM !"
3,The best from bizkit,"I have grown tired of the Limp, significant other and 3 dollar bill are the only cd's i really listen to, when chocolate starfish came out i was into it but i quickly grew tired of its pointless screaming, fred durst is a joke anymore,.. i hope there next cd is better like its planned. Significant other is an awesome cd, and i havent really gotten sick of it, although ive been playing it simultaneously for close to 3 years now."
3,The first cd was much better,"This cd has some good music like trust and nookie, but LB toned down their music too much. 3 Dolla Bills Yall was so much better with stuck, sour, conterfeit. I recently saw LB live and they still put on a kick a** show, but i was disappointed with the cd."
5,Limp Bizkit is the best,There first album was insanely good and this album is the best nookie is the best song theve ever done and Limp Bizkit rules.
5,Awesome,I haven't heard the entire cd yet but i can just tell that it is going to rock after hearing nookie. I can't wait to get the cd and hear it live when they tour this summer.
5,nookie is awesome limp bizkit is one of the best bands out,limp bizkit is the coolest band they rule they're songs are awesome especially counterfeit and nookie LIMP BIZKIT RULES YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,TRL killed the Bizkit,"How can a band go from extreme hardcore to pure pop?. This album is B.S. LB claims they do not see much change in their performance but thats also a load of B.S. Back in their prime Fred Fan loving Durst would constantly rip on the crowd, he even picked a fight with some dude in the front of the pit. Now fred is every 12 year olds hero. What the hell happened?"
4,good,"Although not nearly as good as their first CD, Limp Bizkit came back strong with Significant Other."
1,Brutal? BRUTAL?,"No, 12 this is not brutal. this is terrible. it's corporate garbage as bad as backstreet or nsync. brutal is real metal or hardcore, this is just mindless three chord trash capitalizing on the rap-rock fad. durst's lyrics are hilariously bad, and how anyone could take him seriously are beyond me. it speaks very highly of my generation when the number one song in the country has a chorus of ""stick it up your YEAH."" sucks to the bizkit, buy some real music instead."
1,Limp Bizkit? Just another one of Mtv's [darlings]!,"Look...if i could give this cd a 0 i would. I rate this cd nextto korn's issues and the backstreet boys! All the music has been donebefore. And Limp Bizkit is just one of Mtv's [darlings]. If it wasen't for Mtv Limp Bizkit woulden't be nothing. And in my opnion Mtv ruins bands! Well...Limp Bizkit was never anygood from the beginnig. If you wanna go buy something worth wild go buy some Slipknot, Statix X, Nine Inch Nails...not this peice of..."
4,my review,"I have read many reviews on this site that go on and on about how Durst can't rap or write and how this is just the latest ""fad"" and how its not really metal and not really rap and therefore is bad. Know what? I don't care. I like the way this music sounds and that's all I care about. Go ahead and buy this cd. It's fun and thats all that really matters."
4,GOOD CD,"THIS CD IS very very good. i enjoyed this cd very much and i suggest you all buy it cause it is that good. the besy songs on it are break stuuf, nookie and re-arranged"
1,"Horrible, bland album","Limp Bizkit is another sad example of corporate rock. Their debut album was ok with enough variation to keep you interested but in Nookie, what u hear in the 1st song is what you get. If you need some rock/rap, go buy a rage against the machine album."
2,"Now here is an ""alternative""!","Rap-rock, whatever you call it. The album is filled with profanity and it is mostly pop and rap. The perfect antidote is any of the early albums by Iron Maiden. Many of you who are into Limp Bizkit were probably born when Iron Maiden was at their peak and doing a lot of touring. Now is a perfect time to rediscover ""real"" heavy metal and I recommend anything by Iron Maiden as a perfect antidote to this corruption of heavy metal music by rap. Metal is definitely making a come back."
5,LIMP BIZKIT's IN DA HOUSE,"This album is phat! Everything is from the ""just like this"", to ""a lesson learned. My favorites are don't go off wandering, nookie, 9 teen 90 nine, and break stuff. But they're all good. The interludes,intros, and outros add even more to this CD(i like the billygoat one)! Long time limp fans will enjoy it VERY much, and even new limp fans will. This CD is filled with the rockin' beats of limp bizkit!"
2,What Happened?,"Limp Bizkit used to be an OK band, but when they released this album, they sampled a few songs, they took their song Cambodia, made it into 2 different songs because they wanted to fill up tracks, and were too lazy to write a new song. If you people are looking for GREAT bands, get Nirvana, System of a Down, KoRn (who unfortunatly sold out a while ago), or Sublime. A few of the songs limp bizkit sampled were Faith, Parts of Re-Arranged, and a few other you can find if you can check the album covers. Me, i play guitar, and all of their songs are EXTREMELY easy to play, which is never good. This shows that they make extremely simple songs that were probably thought up, recorded, and edited in an hour. This album is not worth your money."
5,This CD is a great buy.,"I really think you all will enjoy this CD.If you are a fan of the up and coming rock-rap mixture,then you will have to get this.My personal favorites are the rock hits,""Nookie"" and ""Rearranged."" My favorite rap song is ""N 2 Gether Now."" This CD is tight!"
1,Waste of carbon,"Limp Bizkit is terrible. I'm sorry, but this band is so uncreative. This is not rap / rock, and certainly not metal. Just because there's guitars on the chorus of a song like ""Nookie"" doesn't make them rap / rock. If that's what you want, try Rage Against the Machine, System of a Down or something like that. Limp Bizkit is so unoriginal, it's terrible. Of course, this won't stop a lot of people from buying the CD because they see it on MTV's TRL every day."
1,WEAK MUSIC!!! NOT EXTREME AT ALL!!,"Limp Bizkit is sterile, play it safe music, and it is completely about cashing in. Limp is a neutered dog of a band, dragging it's a@@ and trying to make a ruckus to draw attention. They are not good at the heavy part of their music, just like they are no good at the rap part. If anyone wants to hear the downright most abrasive album, it would have to be White Light White Heat by the Velvet Underground. Unbelievably raw, it will hurt your ears. Limp fans, just give up. Everybody knows Limp is about as weak as the Backstreet Boys. They are just a little louder."
1,insignificant fodder,"These guys have very little musical talent. They excell only in putting forth an image. Fred Durst's lyrics on not only this album, but any album, are so LAME as to be embarrasing (""and this sh*t right here, we doin it all the time, every day and every night!"" or whatever). They craft a great image so ignorant teenagers who don't know better will think this is cool and buy the album and feel cool."
2,"Sorry, Fred...","Limp Bizkit has been together a long time, writing and performing songs for years. Their older stuff from Three Dollar Bill had more driven, hardcore and deep lyrics and lots of complex chord progressions. Songs like, ""Counterfeit"", ""Stuck"", and ""Indigo Flow"" really blew me away. But, their new album, Significant Other, really doesn't have all the driven, hardcore and deep guitars and lyrics. Fred Durst is a very talented songwriter, and has written some nice lyrics for the new album, but they just don't live up to their first album. Durst has collaborated with a few new friends on the album, such as Jonathan Davis from KoRn and Method Man. I like this album alot, but it's very light, and driven more towards the rap and hiphop side of their music. If you really want a good hardcore album that you will want to listen to over and over again, I recommend Three Dollar Bill. You will see the differences between the two records."
1,Almost as good as reading Seventeen magazine!,"Oh god, I first saw limp biscuit on total request live (love ya Carson!) and they were like so cool, and I found out all the other eighth graders were listening to them so I had to get my mom to buy this CD along with a pair of tommyhilfeger jeans and Brittainy Spears CD (She is like, my idol. Her song Crazy makes me Crazy!) and this album is so cool, I haven't really listened to any of the songs but Nookie, Re-Arranged and N 2 Gether Now but if they make any more videos then I'll listen to those songs. This is such a cool CD! I like in the Nookie video when the cops come to break up the concert and the band gets mad at them, that is just so cool! I've never really listened to rap before but I really like the way that Fred Durst raps on the CD, it just sounds so cool! Hes the best rapper in the world, along with Kid Rock. Korn, The Backstreet Boys, Kid Rock, Brittainy Spears, and limp biscuit all rock!If you have cotton for brains, that is."
1,"Lowbrows of the world, unite and take over.","'Significant Other' is yet another hideously hackneyed hybrid of horrible hip-hop and harrowing heavy-metal.Fronted by 'hip white boy' Fred Durst, Limp Bizkit aggressively peddle out a panoply of alarmingly tuneless songs in the name of contrived nihilism ('Break Stuff' and 'Show Me What You Got'). And once they've ceased petulantly stomping their feet like little troglodytes that haven't gotten their waterdishes filled, they turn their contempt towards ex-girlfriends ('Nookie' and 'No Sex').Don't bother looking for any progressive or tentative elements in ""Significan Other', or you'll set yourself up for a let down of the Millennium Bug kind. Limp Bizkit is nothing more than a fifth-rate Pantera that attempts to cleverly conceal inevitable comparisons by rapping in double-negatives."
1,This is the WORST BAND EVER!!!,I would give this CD a rating of zero stars if possible. Their sound is terrible and in no way should it be considered music. I don't see how people sit down and listen to this trash. When people use curse words in their music they think they are good or that the use of the words makes them good. That makes me sick that people could even call this music!!!
1,ARGH! What were the record companies thinking?,"This is the WORST album I've heard to date! Even a deaf person would hate this album! Anyone can scream into a microphone and sell it for money! I'm glad another decade is coming, maybe they'll be dumped back into the garage they came from and stay there for good!"
4,A good CD.,"It's not award-winning, but it's good.Just Like This (3/5) - Well, it's okay. But it's kinda pointless.Nookie (4/5) - I like this song. I have no idea why.Break Stuff (5/5) - This is a song for when you are pissed off. Lyrically lacking, but who cares?Re-Arranged (5/5) - This song is really pretty.I'm Broke (2/5) - This song is seriously stupid. It makes no sense. Fred Durst broke?? Give me a break.Nobody Like You (4/5) - This song is pretty good.Don't Go Off Wandering (5/5) - I love this song. Fred sings really well on it.9 Teen 90 Nine - (4/5) This song has some good moments in it. I trust it probably sounds cooler live though.N Together Now - (unrated) If you like rap, it's good. If you don't, it sucks.Trust? (5/5) - This is a good song. It's really heavy.No Sex (5/5) - Ooh ballady!Show Me What You Got (5/5) - Simply a concert song, plus he thanks Slim Shady (not anymore man!). But still good.A Lesson Learned (5/5) - Another pretty ballad."
1,Not So Hot,"Re-aranged and Break stuff are the only really good songs on the whole alblum. N2gehter now and Nokkie are ok, and it sounds as though a good 20 minutes was invested into writing the filler for rest of the alblum. The four singles, which are mentioned above, are the only songs that sound as though any effort was really put into at all."
2,Major change in sound,This album was way too trendy and Mtv and Radio compatable. Fred totally changed the sound to sell more records. Too bad but Limp Bizkit is just another victim to the buisness.
3,Allright,"Limp Bizkit's music ROCKS but there is sooooooo much cursing, and it doesn't need to have it. If you like Limp Bizkit, check out P.O.D. instead!"
2,You may want to listen to real music,"I usually don't take to time to discredit bands, but this music is terrible. It is a shame that so many people my age listen to trash like this. If you are into heavy music, try a little Hendrix."
1,I luv limp bizkit,"Boy, isn't fred durst such a babe. He is so sexy and he says really neat words like ""i did it all for the nookie"". What an amazing sentence. I love it. And listen to those wonderful thud thud noises, i think those are guitars and i think they're not really rocks scraping on cement. Yep, those are great guitars, cause they go thud thud and i love them a lot. Don't you love limp bizkit cause Fred Durst can say amazing words like ""i did it all for the nookie"" and yell and rap and say ""shut the F___ up"". He is so sexy. Oops, did I say that already, well, silly me. And those guitars they go thud thud."
1,As likable as a fat man in spandex......,"Hmmm.....let's see....MTV worthy riffs, not exactly thought provoking lyrics, and an ultra whiny voice could only mean one thing....Limp Bizkit's back!! And boy am I not happy! Buy this cd only if you wanna make Fred Durst and his flunkies even richer."
1,Overrated...Fred did it ONLY for the nookie!,"Listen to this CD...All you hear is stupid, immature, meaningless lyrics that are yelled by some guy over tracks that sound like a car wrecking yard at peak hour. ""I did it all for the nookie,"" screams Fred Durst. What do you think he did it for? The music?"
5,1000 times better than 3 dollar bill yall,I heard some of the tracks. This album is darker and smarter lyrics. You can tell Fred has been working on his voice.
2,an overrated band,"This release from Limp Bizkit is slightly more diverse and mature than their first album. However, their exaggerated rap/metal gimmick is bound to wear thin. Eventually this ugly wave of rap/metal artists like Limp Bizkit, Korn, Kid Rock, etc. will just disappear and the fickle record buying public will move on to the next trend. In all fairness, this band has a cool guitar sound and that is why I reluctantly gave them 2 stars. The 15 minutes of fame clock is ticking away."
1,Puh-lease! And this is music?????!!!!!!,"It doesn't deserve even one star! Fred Durst can't sing, and Wes, or whatever his name is, is just as bad"
5,Best album of 1999,"Everyone seems to hate Fred Durst, but when this came out it was the biggest album around, this is the album that really made nu metal mainstream, korn's freak on a leash brought it to every one's attention, but this is one of the best albums ever made, debuted at no.1. Nookie, RE-arranged, and break stuff are the best three song combo you could ever put together, every song on the album is solid and could be used as a single, i thought they couldve done without n together now, but other than that its solid. One of the best ever made no matter what anyone says, it spawned a whole genre"
3,"Gee, I wonder who sold out?","OK, I understand we all have bills to pay but come on. This CD has a couple good songs which are the real Limp Bizkit. Other than that, MTV did a number on these guys which one might refer to as ""Selling Out Big"". Like I said, I understand the financial burden of playing for small clubs, but don't sell out, then try to act so suprised by the reaction from your ""real fans""."
3,Whats up with this Cd,What happened. This cd is missing the best thing that made limp the best ( the raw-insane kinetic energy ripping riffing ) whats with all these mellow songs. This cd is not the limp I loved. Wheres the mad yelling. And last time I knew limp didn't need a bunch of guests on their cd to kick. Its ok I guess I can still listen to my 3dollar bill some more. I'll give this cd a few more goes and see if I change my mind.
4,good mix of beats and sounds,"i enjoyed listening to fred and the band they've really expanded since ""three dollar bill, yall"" the mixes on this cd vary so much definitely good music that will be talked about for along time i compare them to kid rock and i think they mesh well together"
3,its ok,"some of the stuff is ok, but the only reason it is setting on top of the charts is its become ""popular"" to listen to rap/metal, its not near and structured and korn or deftones, the riffs are really simple to play the lyrics are pretty simple, but its ok i guess."
5,This is a great cd real great songs and lyrics,I think this is there better cd there first one was not bad but this one rocks and is so awsome it has real awsome lyrics and the songs are killer.
1,Yoooooooo da Bizkit in da houze!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11111111111,"Yo playas da Bizkit is like da bestest band eva yo Fred Durst iz like, da man yo holla at ma boi Fred Durst!!!!. Ma hommiez at da mall luv da Bizkit yo Fred is a like GOD and Wez Borlan da beztezt guitar playa eva yo da Bizkit like is right hurrr keep rollin yo ""Just like This"" is one of the most Kool songs eva yo Fred is a genius yo da Bizkit rockz in da houze!!!!!!!!!!1111111111111"
5,Best CD!,"I like Kid Rock, Eminem, and KoRn a bit better than Limp Bizkit, but this CD is better than all of their CDs. Limp Bizkit has great songs on this album. Rearranged really isn't that great and neither is Nookie, but listen to No Sex, Just Like This, N2Gether Now, and the best song on this album- Break Stuff. If you put this CD in the computer it has a video where you can speed up the song Nookie. It also features guitarist's Wes Borland's art work for wall paper and its really good. And please note that Fred Durst takes up all the spotlight in Bizkit. The best member is Wes Borland."
1,what a wack group,first they wreck a george michael song faith then prince's 1999 what next a michael jackson song? they play loud and nothing comes out but wack noise.mtv can have them next in the puffy bin.cuz with all those wack covers and brainless music that's where they are headed.what a bad headache they are.
5,Beastie,"this cd is much better than their first. breakstuff is the best.who ever gave one star is wacked it rocks who ever said fred durst dosen't sing was right he more or less raps so, shut up!!"
3,Alright....,"Well, I'm really not a Limp fan, but I decided to listen to this and its really not THAT horrible. Yeah, I hate the rapping, and i loathe Nookie, but there are a few good songs, such as ""Break Stuff"", ""Just Like This"" and ""Nobody Like You"". Most of it is to slow for me, and Three Dollar Bill Ya'll is better."

5,PERFECT!!,"This is a hard-to-find item, but this one is IT. This is the ""original"" Krups carafe WITH measurements on the side. Very happy. Not much more to say other than super fast shipping."
1,Somethings Missing,"I was surprised at how quick my Krups 589-42 Replacement Carafe (in Black) arrived. I opened the box to make sure it wasn't damaged but did not use it until a week or so later. My husband was the one to notice that there were no water level marks on the glass portion of the carafe. A true Krups Carafe would have came with water level marks. If I purchased this so-called ""new"" carafe - - - - - - why are the marks missing."
5,coffee carafe,"Carafe is fine. Thin glass which broke easily, but coffee maker works well and cheaper than buying a new coffee maker."
2,wrong photo,"The product that I received was not what was pictured although the model number was the same. Not sure why the mix up but i had to return it and was forced to buy the replacement carafe elsewhere as Amazon could not explain why the item was not as pictured. The item I got elsewhere was the same model number and WAS the design shown int he picture. If you need the round model shown in the picture, be careful ordering this from Amazon (they did provide a full refund)."
3,Handle with care!,I'm here purchasing the third carafe for my coffee maker. This carafe is nice to look at but extremely fragile!
3,Encouragement from a leading critic,"A lecture by the late Leo Steinerg, one of the leading lights of American Art History. It is personal and informal, fitting the occasion,an event honoring Rauschenberg, of whose work he was an early supporter. This is pleasant reading, particularly for those accustomed tothe more complex style of his academic writing.The only disappointment I experienced was in my failure to find any reason, which resonated with me, as to why I should be equally impressed by the work of this contemporary of mine. However, to many, Rauschenberg is a signicant contemporary artist,for them, this graceful piece will evoke the glow that comes from shared sentiments."
4,detalles pero en buenas condiciones,the team is in very good condition but did not come with original charger and that made it to buy a genuine charger not charge t
5,great PC,i bought this refurb pc and i really like it.it has great sound and is pretty fastthe graphics are great for the average person.the seller was really good about the warranty and responded to my questions promptly.i would buy another one of these
5,What I was looking for and more.,A great price for a great laptop. I have a new laptop with Windows 8 and I like this one much better. I will sell the new one now. Great comunacation with the seller too. BIG plus.
4,Good,Computer came on time...a little heavy and gets very hot when charging..and battery only last an hour..will use until I can find something better
5,My cousin.,"My cousin was in bad need for a computer to take her online courses, so I helped her out. She loves this!"
2,no customer service,I bought two of these lap tops they work as they are supposed to but the batteries in both laptops were junk. I couldn't get a response from the seller when I inquired about the batteries I will never buy from them again......
5,Easy to use computer for my kids,I bought 2 of these for my kids for christmas and they love them! Easy to use and cheap enough for me to buy them each a laptop of their own.
4,supportive but not so great shaping,"easy on hand open/close. AVOID BUYING FOR BIRTH AND BABY! Ihave ordered many times from this company hoping to support a small business but every time at least part of my order was out of stock. I wasn't informed for this until weeks after the order was placed. I placed what is my last order attempt with them a month ago and still don't have my goods because Birth and BAby doesn't don't have any of it in stock. Their reports of ""In stock "" you see on Amazon or their website is rarely correct- basically a lie."
5,Great voices,I loved the songs and the voices of these two artists. How very sad Mr. Licitra won't be heard anymore.
4,Duetto,"Product looked perfect except for tear in plastic cover. As I purchased the CD as a gift, this was a minus."
2,Pop Op,"Their voices blend well and the opera duets are a little out of the ordinary. Unfotunately,they have been orchestrated with a Hollywood flair and sung with synthetic flamboyance. What a pity that it is only nice background music. I had hoped for excitement."
2,"Excuse me, what is this?","If you want to hear pop music, buy Andrea Bocelli's albums. At least Bocelli has the appropriate ""voice"" for the style. The singing here is as if they were afraid to sound operatic. It is unrewarding singing for them and for the experienced opera listener. I am not fond of Licitra. I believe he will be gone in a couple of years. But, Marcelo, come on! What are you trying to do? Isn't a full schedule and a great deal with CAMI enough to keep you happy? Please go back to il duca and forget about recording albums singing like you never were taught, along with overrated mediocrities.EDIT - Well, I was wrong. Licitra is still around... unfortunately for the paying opera audiences."
5,One of the Greatest shows!,Mary Tyler Moore's show was one of the best TV has had to offer! I enjoy having the DVDs and knowing I can sit down and watch them whenever I like as the show would never grow old for me!
5,KEEP EM COMING!,"At long last ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" gets its third season pumping. Hopefully Fox will keep cranking them out, because ironically (unlike most shows), ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" got better each season vs. worse. By the time the fourth season hit, more laughs and one-liners were being thrown at us. And thank God for Betty White, who immortalized Sue Ann Nivens as the bitchy, happy homemaker. This is one of the best comedies of all time. And truly deservant of its 29 Emmy wins. Season 3 includes ""Its Whether You Win or Lose"" which sadly, didn't earn Gavin MaCleuad an Emmy nomination- and he's the only principal cast member never to win or be nominated. It also includes ""Put on a Happy Face"", one of Mary Tyler Moore's five best performances on the show."
5,Pure Pleasure!,"This is the most wonderful TV show. It has barely aged a bit. The jokes are often funny and a pleasure to hear. I think actors were more gifted at doing this type of comedy in the earlier years of television. Mary is a single woman trying to make it as an associate producer while her friends, family and coworkers swirl around her in various ways. She is usually the most normal one in the bunch and a charming person at that. While some reviewers comment that this season isn't as good as the first, second or fourth seasons, I found it every bit as charming and hilarious. There isn't a big standout episode as much as a series of excellent episodes. The effect is charming and consistent. There isn't a bad episode in the bunch. The actors were well used to their characters by the third season and they were better developed. It was a joy to watch and I highly recommend it."
5,My favourite sitcom... ever.,These shows don't date. They are as fresh as they were over 30 years ago. These shows deserved all the Emmys they received. A must-see series. I'm glad they are finally releasing them. I would prefer more extra features though. More show commentary would be nice as well.
5,Still the best!,I'm so glad they keep releasing more seasons of MTM. Such a good show that really holds up over the years. Keep 'em coming!!
2,"great dvd, but",Good quality but you have to select each chapter seperately. I would not buy those kinds of dvd's if I knew this up front.
3,Mary Tyler Moore Show Season 4,"This season was not as enjoyable as the previous two or the fourth season, but still a nice addition to the collection."
4,MTM - Season 3,"Like most fans, each season grew better than the last, as Mary and friends matured professionally and gracefully. It's irritating how Fox has produced the set, with few commentaries - no MTM, for example- and each episode reverts back to the main menu, just like the Bob Newhart season DVDs, which is irritating.The writing is - as always- clever and sensational , and fans grew to love Mary more with each season. It's very disturbing to see the diva now - after all the plastic surgery- looking nothing like the Mary we knew and loved; At least Valerie Harper aged gracefully and naturally, as did the rest of the cast, all but Ted Knight still with us."
3,MTM- disc missing,"DVD came in a timely manner, however, the first disc was replaced by the second disc. So I received 2 second discs and one third disc but no first."
5,Picture quality is as good as the first two DVD releases,"When I saw this season was being released without any bonus features, I worried that Fox had skimped on the quality of the re-mastering just so they could release it in a hurry.No worries! Each episode has the same vibrant colors and excellent sound as the Season 1 and 2 releases. Episodes are uncut and look beautiful.This season is special to me because it has my all-time favorite episode (sorry, ""Chuckles"" is #2) -- ""Put on a Happy Face"" -- worth watching anytime you're having a bad day.Here's to seasons 4 through 7, as soon as Fox can get them out."
4,Put on a Happy Face!,"There will never be another like The Mary Tyler Moore Show and I think this set contains one of the very best episodes. ""Put on a Happy Face"" here we get to see our perky Mary Richards run though the ringer... it's nice to know we all have bad days...hilarious!Only complaint I have is there are NO special features on this set... I guess we can't have our cake and eat it too."
2,Intricate Minds II Understanding Elementary School Classmates with Asperger Syndrome,"I was not impressed. I purchased this to be shown to my son's class so that they would have a better understanding of Asperger's as my son has been diagnosed with it (and the rate of children diagnosed with Autism spectrum is on the rise). It was a really short DVD (even for the elementary school level). It did not give examples of some of the common traits/challenges that can go with being on the spectrum: sensory challenges (sensitive to smells, touch, textures, how with some children it ""hurts"" to make eye contact, etc) social challenges: (i.e. some children just like talking about one interest and need to be ""redirected"" and encouraged to talk about other interests, etc.)"
3,Just Bloomed,"While not bad, I was a little disappointed.As I was looking for a new perspective on painting the nude figure, I thought there could have been a few more examples,but clothing can tend to become cumbersome when one is trying new outlets in watercolor andalso difficult to capture."
3,Nice bit of pretty girl art,"Nice bit of pretty girl artwork of Playboy caliber, sometimes they aren't even naked. Includes water color (see the cover) and pencil sketches. Good artist. But overall not much more variety than most other sources: all white 18-25 year old young ladies. Nice enough for a nude art collection."
5,An excellent book for artists,Boris is right on target with this one. I highly reccomend this book for nude artists. the drawings in this book are the way nudes should be done.
5,BenQ Projector Lamp,"This seems to be a perfect replacement for my projector except for the connector plug. That part is easily moved from the old lamp to the new one, making the fit just right. Information on model numbers is great since there is much confusion as to which lamp fits which model, even at the BenQ website. Shipment was very quick -- overall, I was very pleased."
2,Waste of time.,We rented this DVD set for free from our local library. I am glad we didn't pay anything for it because it was not very good. It only had two recipes in the entire 4 disc set that I want to try. This DVD set will put you to sleep.
1,Read the fine print--BEWARE,"I actually ordered these from weathertech directly. Put in my vehicle (Hyundai Sante Fe) and all, and was lead to believe that these were going to fit. When received, I tried to install them. They really did not fit well at all. I called weathertech and was told that they are NOT made to be vehicle specific, but are the best fit they have available for my vehicle, and that if I read the info about them it says that. They are correct (technically) that in the expanded information, way down there, they do state that these are not exact fit.... For that price I expected way more and returned them. (Bought some for $20 that I had to cut to fit). This is not an Amazon problem but a Weathertech issue. I tried to post on their website and was blocked from doing so."
2,Front Floor Mats,"Though the item seemed well made, it did not fit my 2002 Toyota Sequoia, as promised. When ordering this item I also ordered the rear floor mat. Oddly, the rear floor mat fits exactly!"
1,DO NOT FIT,THESE DO NOT FIT SCION XB 2005 HOLES IN THE WRONG PLACE FOR FACTORY HOOKS.DRIVERS MATT CATCHES ON GAS PEDAL. I EVEN CONTACTED THEM ABOUT CORRECT FIT AND THEY DO NOT FIT.
1,WeatherTech W31 Bad fit for Toyota Rav4,I bought the WeatherTech W31 rubber floor mats to replace the Toyota all weather floor mats I had since the vehicle was new. The fit of the WeatherTech floor mats was a joke. They do not even come close to laying down on the floor nicely. Unfortunately they do not make the molded floor liner for a 2005 Rav4.
2,A significant disappointment,Reitz misses a great deal concerning what is important for the incorporation of immigrants. The book has a relatively narrow empirical focus and thus deprives itself of the sort of comparative basis that would allow for a more insightful treatment. Immigration studies will require a more broad-minded approach to move beyond some of the half-truths that continue to characterize popular and sometimes even scholarly thinking.
3,Best for children over 6 years old.,I bought this for my 2 and 4 year olds. It is on it's way out in the pail!The tree is useless and tips over all the time. The accessories are few and the lego amounts to about 9 pieces. That is it. The water piece is pretty limiting in size...again use your imagination.You need a child that has a big imagination to play with the scenes provided. The fun factors here are Diego himself and the truck you get to tear apart and make into 2 other vehicles.
3,"An ""Honest"" account about honesty-challenged people","I read this book following the death of President Reagan so found it timely and revealing since I observed Patti and her mother during the funeral ceremonies. This family is surely one which struggled with their relationships; according to the author, most of the time they failed with the notable exception of Pres. Reagan and Nancy Reagan. Patty was quite honest and direct in admitting her weaknesses and her failures; she was brutally frank in her assessments of her parents. I found her life quite shallow and do not think she has made much of a contribution to this word, although I do not know what has occupied her time from the writing of the book to the present. I would recommend this book to anyone who would like to have inside information about the family, but bear in mind that there are always two sides to every story and we only hear the one side in this autobiography."
2,Spoiled Rich Girl Uses Parents' Fame to Make Even More $$$,"This book details Ms Davis' struggles for personhood. She surfs through a charmed life on her parents' fame, and then claims to be courageous and independent because she argues with her parents. At the end of her struggle, she acheives a rare shallowness of which she is extremely proud because it's not quite as bad as her parents'. The dirt on the Reagan family was interesting, but only in an Enquirer sort of way. This book reminds me a lot of BD Hyman's book about her mother, Bette Davis."
3,Enjoyable,This book was nothing spectacular but an enjoyable book. It was a novel of fiction but I had expected to read non-fiction because of who the author was. I hope he will venture out and write more in the future.
3,good series,I loved this series when it was first on T.V. and hubby wanted to see it again so I bought the entire series through Amazon and we thoroughly enjoyed it. How many times have I wished I could be someone else! lol It's fun to pretend!
5,We just like this show,"If you like positive shows that don't have alot of crap in them, then you might like this show. However, those that like the ""reality"" TV might not find this entertaining because it doesn't have enough drama."
3,laptop wetsuit,"This product is exactly as advertised - it provides some extra padding - that's about it. I guess the design is to accommodate slightly different sizes, which works, but the shape is weird."
1,Bulbs not changeable,"Good product when it works but once the light goes out, there is no way to replace it so you need to throw the lantern away. Thats a fatal design flow. We didn't even use it much, its been sitting on the shelf. Come on GE!"
1,Bulb breakage leads to whole unit in garbage? Not eco-friendly!,"It never even occurred to me to use this for emergencies, as the power here goes out so seldom. I bought this in a store's camping department, and that's what we use it for. Unfortunately, last weekend while camping a big storm blew through and knocked the lantern over. No big deal, it just tipped off the hanger it was on and fell about 3 feet. It's rugged, right?The bulb never came on right after that. We opened it up to find out exactly what type it was so we could buy another, and found out it's NOT a normal replaceable bulb; it's hardwired into the base. Once the bulb is dead your lantern is dead. What an absolute waste of money and materials!"
2,Not Worth The Money,"Yes, this was a great light when it worked. Now that the bulb is out, there is NO WAY to replace it. A sledge hammer would be necessary to break in to get the bulb out, then what's the point. I definitely would recommend buying something you can replace the bulb."
2,Cashing in on Coaching,"This is not really a book about coaching. There are many other books that assist coaches to learn about ways of assisting clients and they are actually written by experienced coaches. ""Total Life Coaching"" by Dr. Patrick Williams is just one example. Instead, the author-experts have taken a useful technique (solution-focused psychotherapy) and applied it to coaching. Readers will learn about the technique, but I think it has less to do with real coaching and more to do with therapists and book publishers cashing in on the latest trend in working with people who want to achieve their dreams."
5,Fits Like A Glove,Perfect fit for my Genesis S-310. Very durable compared to others owned in the past. I leave my grill outside all year round and it can handle all weather conditions.
5,cover,The grill cover is great. It fits the grill prefectly and is a heavy vinyl material. Would purchase again.
2,"Great cover, poor design!","Weber quality is great, but this design sucks. I spend more time cleaning up after the rain than I do grilling! Too bad, nice cover, other than the vents!Vents are good, in the right places, and I am sure that a cover with a well placed vent would help the Grill last longer. However, this design is not the way to go."
1,Do Not Buy This Cover...,"Bought this cover for my EP-320 Genesis grill and returned it. I really like the grill but I cannot believe that Weber would put something on the market like this. I bought the Classic Veranda Cover. The web site states that you will need the large size for this grill(grill is 60"" long, medium size up to 58"") but the medium size fits this grill perfectly."
1,Poor Quality,"This is a very handsome cover, but appearances are deceiving. After a few months, the stitching virtually dissolved on one side then the other. I tossed it and got a well-constructed generic cover for less than half the price. The replacement has already outlasted the name brand and shows no sign of deterioration. Its construction is not as complicated as the Weber, but it is quite attractive. BOTTOM LINE: The Weber 7553 Genesis Series Cover might look like authentic, but it doesn't act like a real Weber product."
2,Don't Waste Your Money On This Cover !,"This cover was a gift, so I used it only to find out how bad of a design it really is. I don't want rain and snow on my grill if I'm willing to take the time and cover it! Go [...] and buy the large Veranda Collection Grill Cover. It's good looking, durable, doesn't leak and fits your Weber S320 perfect."
1,Bad bad buy!,"This cover has two side vents, thus NOT protecting the grill from rain. So this is not a cover!! I had the same reaction as many of the other buyers: why in the world would I want a cover with holes in it? I am returning this non-cover ASAP."
5,Simple Elegance,"The Weber grill cover looked nice and clean out of the box, fit snuggly over the grill, and came at a relatively low cost."
5,Purchases at Amazon,"I searched for a cover for my new Webber gas grill. Once again, Amazon offered the lowest price. $15.00 less than the next best price I could find both on the internet and in retail stores in the area."
4,Weber Grill cover,"This cover works very nicely with my grill - it fits well, and appears to be fairly good grade material. I have no complaints."
1,Weber cover is poorly designed,"Bought the standard weber cover for my new stainless steel S-310 gas grill.Was disappointed to see large puddles on each wing shelf upon removing cover. Weber advised me the vents in the cover were intentionally designed to let air in to prevent mold on cover and let moisture out.The fact that they let large amounts of water settle on each shelf, as well as around each gas knob can not be a good thing over time.So now I am looking for a cover for my cover."
2,cover,"this cover fits nicely. the problem is, on the sides it has mesh panels, I guess for wind. These let the water in all over the steel counter tops. Sort of defeats the purpose of a cover right?"
1,Dreadful quality!,Genesis (E330) cover. Have tried 2 Weber Genesis covers. The first had vents and simply let rain in. Joke! The 2nd felt good and had no silly vents....but after 6 months the seams showed wear and my BBQ was wet underneath. After 9 months it is held together by gaffer tape and still lets rain in. Overpriced rubbish. (My Weber charcoal BBQ cover is fine).
1,Awful!,Vents ruin it. Will have to buy another one now. Awful! I feel weber should recall it and let us exchange for the new one. Does anyone kniw if they ever issued a response to this terrible design flaw?
2,Good first few years - Model Change?,"I bought this cover 3 years ago. It was good but kept shrinking, now it no longer fits. However, it's the same model number it looks like the cover has changed so not sure if the issue still remains. But i had to trash mine because it would no longer fit on my Weber Genesis."
2,"Nice cover, poor vent placement","As others have noted, while this is a very nice fitted cover, the placement of vents right over the side panels is maddening. I called Weber about it, and they said they did it to allow moisture to dry. Um, the problem is, the vents allow an awful lot of moisture to get on the side panels in the first place. Duh....."
2,Bad design,"Avoid this grill cover if where you live there is rain or snow. The mesh vents are positioned poorly so that rain water will collect on the grills side burner, burner controls and electronic ignition!Called Weber and their customer service rep gave me some run around about how it allows the cover to vent condensation away.. Of course had they designed it right I would not have to worry about a half gallon of water needing to evaporate off the grill.Have used the cover now for over a month and one of the mesh vents already is coming lose from the cover. Looks as if the stitching is of sub par quality.I would not have expected this experience from a Weber product. I own two of their grills, two sets of grill tools, mits, apron and charcoal starts all of which work great! However, this product is a complete failure and expensive one at that."
4,It works even with the side vents,I noted the uproar about the side mesh vents on this cover. So I tried to find the older model 9885 in various places. I only found this 7553 model and stopped looking after a few places. We have had 2 significant rain showers this past week so I got to test the cover. In fact it was raining heavily last night with heavy winds and the cover stayed put. I did not notice any puddles on the tray areas on my Genesis E320 today. The grill is freestanding without any nearby trees to deflect rain so it's functional even with the side vents. Maybe the older model is better but this one works at least. The vinyl is heavy and should be durable. The E320 has stainless steel trays set into plastic sides so at least they shouldn't rust if water does accumulate. Amazon's prices were around $10 dollars cheaper than brick and mortar hardware store. If my experience shopping is an indication it will be hard to find the older 9885 model of cover.
1,Counter effective cover; it actually channels water into your grill!,"Weber really designed this poorly. Not only does it funnel rain water into your grill's control knobs, ignighter, and the side burner unit, but, it somehow manages to divert water into the grease catching tray until it is full - or overflowing - with water. Emptying a filled-to-the-brim tray with grease and water w/o a disgusting greasy mess is nearly impossible.My write-up for the grill was 5 star. Why cover a grill so it will collect water and spread it all over the grill that you spent $50+ to protect?"
3,weber gas grill cover 7553 genesis series,"it is a nice heavy quality material, but they put mesh side vents in where the side shelves are and water gets in when it rains...what a strange design...who needs vent in a grill cover...we don't put it on until the grill is cold..."
2,"Good, but terrible","This grill cover is made of very nice material and fits perfectly on my grill. No complaints there...the only complaint that I have is with the mesh windows that sit above the side tables. I am not sure why they would do this since it allows the rain to go right in. So, every time that I take the cover off, there is a pool of water on each side table that I have to clean off. It also lets a lot of pollen in, which is great mixed with the water.I understand that there needs to be vents in the cover, I am just not sure about the placement on this cover. Why not put it on the front and back on the vertical face of the cover, still over the tables? This would at least minimize the standing water."
3,The only REALLY nice thing is the weber logo.,"OK cover, but like the other owners on here, I am a little disappointed in the mesh sides that allow water and dust to get in. These should have been located lower or shingled in some way underneath. It is also too short and exposes the bottom of the grill. I actually really bought it just so I can show off the fact that it is a Weber cover (logo) for my new Weber grill. Otherwise, a generic cover would function just as good if not better."
1,Very disapointed ;(,"Even though I'm very pleased with my e320 grill, the cover is an absolute failure! There are two large square meshed vents on top. It rained and let all the water in and I had to uncover the grill to let it dry off!?! This means that every time it rains I get to uncover it!!!Buyer beware you have been warned!"
1,What a bummer.,"I usually read the reviews before I buy but, this time I did not and what a surprise.After I finished covering my new grill with my brand new cover I noticed the openings on the side, I was confused, It did not make any sense why would Weber put openings on the side when you want to protect your investment from the elements especially the rain. Anyway, confused, I went and checked the cover picture on the box, it didn't have openings on the side. So I thought I got the wrong product and did a search in the internet and that's when I realized my mistake about getting this cover. If you want to protect your grill from water DO NOT GET this cover."
2,DO NOT BUY FOR S320 GRILL!!!,"I read about the side vents but they were not too clear whether it will affect the S320 as well. When I looked at the product photo, it seemed the vents were below the left and right tables. I was wrong. Those were the velcro straps you can use to snugly fit the cover on the grill so it will not get blown away. The vents were on the left and right side of the cover, on the fabric ABOVE the tables. It rained a day after I received the cover. When I checked it after the rain, there were puddles of water on both side tables. I took a couple of photos and will post them here. The quality of the material and the fit is great. I really do not understand why they placed the vents there. That ruined what could have been a perfect Genesis grill cover."
1,Most Bizarre Thing I've Ever Bought,"After forking out a lot of money for a quality grill, I decide to buy the Weber cover to take good care of it.This is the most retarded product I've ever bought! As other's mention, there are two large mesh windows on the the side tops over the stainless steel work areas. When it rains, everything gets soaked!One response said Weber told him it was for dust and leaves. Huh? Is it only for Arizona?I'm am extremely upset about this cover, and the responses here make show a bizarre and out-of-touch manufacturer.Some people mentioned finding an older version, with a mesh on the back. I'll return this to Home Depot and look for a version like that or opt for a generic cover."
3,Suggestion for a substitute for this cover,"I read the negative reviews on this Genesis E310 grill cover regarding the vents over the side tables and the fact that these vents allow water to get inside the cabinet. I looked around until I found the ""Mr Bar-B-Q Platinum Prestige Premium Grill Cover"" and ordered it.The Mr Bar-B-Q grill cover came today and I put it on my Genesis E310 immediately. Fits perfectly and is excellent quality. I would recommend the Mr Bar-B-Q grill cover if you are concerned about the vents in the Weber cover."
2,Does not Last,I was disappointed in the WEBER cover that I purchased three and half years ago. It did hold to the weather elements and started to crack and tear. Do not waste your money on this grill cover. I just purchased the Classic Veranda Cart BBQ Cover to replace it. Check the outstanding reviews on my replacment cover.
4,New 7553 definitely has NO vents,"I can confirm that the new 7553 cover has no vents. I was going to take the Brinkman cover due to the reviews but then I found an open cover box at HD and saw that there were no vents. I immediately grabbed a sealed box since although the US and Canadian dollar are at PAR, HD US sells it for $49 while HD Canada sells it for $89!!!!<RANT> Same company selling the same product within 20 miles of each other and almost double the cost</END RANT> :)"
2,Don't buy,"I bought this grill cover when I purchased my Genesis Grill. After about 1 year, the cover has basically fallen apart. I live in Arizona and have it in partial sun. The seams starting opening up and now there are huge holes in the front and read of the cover on both the left and right sides.Save your money and buy another cover that fits the Genesis."
1,Great Company produces a JUNK cover,"Purchased this cover with my Weber Sumit 420 10 months ago. I have always liked Weber products but this cover is a engineering disaster. This cover with the side vents not only lets the water in, but also lets all the dirt in. I guess if you enjoy cleaning up the mess inside the base cabinet, this is the cover for you. Do yourself a favor, and do not buy this cover. Weber, shame on you!! And to add insult to injury, they still sell this one."
3,I'm with the others - What's with the holes?,This is only my second Weber grill cover in the last ten years. The material is solid and I anticipate that this will last a long time BUT - WHAT ON EARTH WAS WEBER THINKING?!? The big holes do nothing to keep ou the rain. A dust free grill is great and all but when there are huge water puddles onthe decks - not good.
3,I agree -- bad design!,"After reading about the same problem from so many other people, I would have bought a different cover except I couldn't find any with the correct dimensions so I just went ahead and got this one. I agree with everyone -- this is a REALLY dumb design! And if the vents are needed (and I still can't imagine why in the world they would be!) then why AREN'T they shown on the picture on the box??? It's not like tons of water get into them, but any water sort of defeats the purpose, doesn't it? I think we're going to try to cover the vents with black tape to minimize the amount of water that gets in. But except for that (which is kind of a HUGE ""but""...), it's a quality made product."
1,Don't buy this cover unless you want water puddles inside the grill,"Unfortunately, I didn't read the reviews on Amazon before buying. I just ""assumed"" that the Weber grill cover was the one to use with my new grill. We had rain the same day I put on the cover...puddles of rain on the side burner sections; moisture on top of the grill. Who needs it. I did what others suggested here and elsewhere...I went to Home Depot and got the corresponding Charmglow cover for less $$ and no vents!"
2,darn vents!,"The other reviewers are right - this is a really nice, well-made cover with a fatal flaw. The vents do not keep the rain out. No wonder all of our neighbors keep their grills in their garages."
2,I'll bet Weber's warehouses are filled with returns.,"Just adding my discontented voice to others. The manufacturer's product photo shows vents on the lower vertical surface but the actual product in the box has vents on the upper angled surface. See the customer photo: that's what you get.Aside from the misleading product photo, Weber may argue that the design lets out moisture, but it sure seems counter-intuitive. What about snow? What about in a humid region? Is this the best they can do?This cover might be good for dry regions, but there's got to be a better design to prevent rust."
3,"Details, Details","I thought I heard Jack tell Dr Tess Martin to get on I-90 and head south. Hello? I-90 goes east and west. If you want to go south on an Interstate highway in Seattle, you need I-5. I know that and I live in Ohio!The synopsis also says that the doctor's son has been infected. Video cues suggest that she envisioned someone near and dear to her on a gurney, but it was a vision and not reality.Still, overall it's a decent flick."
3,Excellent series but the least important book in it,"The Elementary Go series are all excellent, but joseki -- opening patterns -- are the least important thing to learn when you start the game. So I rate this lower than the other books in the series althought the quality of it is high."
1,fast action cool,This game is fun and my boys love it (ages 9 & 12). It is easy to understand and follow or play alone. It also doesn't take up to much space in the room. Thanks to Fisher Price for coming up with a product that is cool for kids and is not a baby toy that I would associate with Fisher Price.
5,Who would have cooked a steak this way?,"So, I have very happy memories of the Palm, mostly the one in DC, growing up. The ultimate special occasion food.So I was nervous looking at the cookbook. Was it a case of, Kids, Don't Try This At Home?The reality couldn't have been more different. This is the Anti-French-Laundry cookbook, where everything comes together quickly and easily, and you hit your head sqarely for not having thought of it yourself.The big insight for me was a very odd yet extremely effective way of cooking steaks. I've cooked lots of fine steaks, but the way they suggest worked perfectly. And it was, you know, different, but great for entertaining. And it tasted wonderful.I *think* this would be a good cookbook even if you haven't had a great time at the Palm, but if you have, it's great. Five stars."
5,The Best Lasagna Recipe!,"I was given this book as a gift by someone who once took me to the Palm in Las Vegas. The recipes are great, and I especially like the pastas--especially the lasagna recipe, which takes a long time and is completely worth it!"
3,The Palm Cookbook,"I love the restaurant but got this book only because my wife wanted their creamed spinach recipe. Turns out the DC branch uses a slightly different recipe, so........"
5,Great book for all ages,"We started to use Vision last Advent for our fellowship. People like it so much that we continue to use Mission this year. Besides using it in Advent for the 4 weeks of 'retreat' for our whole church including the youths who have confirmed, we continue to use it for the monthly fellowship. It's convenient, easy to carry, read and reflect. I even use it as a Christmas gift to my God children."
1,Don't buy this one!,"There are several different translations of Basho's Narrow Road extant and without doubt this is the worst generally available. Dorothy Britten's translations of both the text and verse cloy terribly, and betray her shallow understanding of the form. Her translations of some of Basho's best haiku rhyme, which should be enough to put anyone off.If you want to buy a translation of this wonderful work, I recommend a different Kodansha publication -- the edition featuring Masayuki Miyata's breathtaking illustrations and Donald Keene's somewhat academic but still vastly superior translations. Don't buy this one!"
2,"Nice volume, but not the best translation","Although Ms. Bitton's translations of Basho's prose are not far off from other versions of this title, many have complained of the rhyming scheme she employs when translating the haiku verses of the author's most famous work. I do agree, that these translations are somewhat jarring and just a little cumbersome (especially if one has knowledge of other translations of this haibun). But Bitton's effort was devoted to making the verses more accessible to Western readers accustomed to the perceived elegance of the rhyme in popular Western poetry. This, one may argue, is the job of a translator, and thus is not an all too terrible introduction to ""The Narrow Road,"" especially for younger readers. However, if one truly wishes to enjoy this, one of Japan greatest literary volumes, please seek other versions as well. The difficult art of translation is in itself a fascinating study."
1,Ha what a joke,"Click on the menu item you wish to choose, select the appropriate options, examine the results. 90% of this book is just that sentence over and over again. If you want to learn, you have to have concrete examples, not general suggestions. Don't waste your money like I did."
2,Dreamweaver 4 or Dreamweaver MX ?,This book got only 124 pages for the features that gives MX extension to Dreamweaver 4 .Dreamweaver MX isnt an upgrade for Dreamweaver 4. I think it is the never version of Ultradev 4 . so it's best side is dynamic side not static side.So you cant find a lot of thing for this side in this book. There are 5 chapters in this book for dynamic side but you can find these chapter's contents in official Using Dreamweaver MX book.This book is a big book and you can find every menus and commands in it but I think a BIBLE series must be change their content aproach. We dont need an another User Guide so why we buy a book if we are OK with manuals ?If you are a beginner and want to see all aspects of dreamweaver without day2day cases and beginning2finishing tutorials or you havent got F1 button in your keyboard you can use this book.
2,Learning Dreamweaver,"If you are new to Dreamweaver and web page designing, you would be makng a mistake if you purchase this book. The book is designed for an experienced individual in computer applications and unless you devote a large percentage of your time on web page design, it is not recommended. The author should split the book in, perhaps, four different sections beginning with a simple web page design. The first section should contain no more than 25 pages to allow beginners to experiment on one page design. The second section should deal with multiple page design. The other sections should relate to more complex designs used by professional users. Nowadays, many people are purchasing web sites and, because they cannot design pages and are not prepared to pay high prices for web page design, the sites are not being used. It is my firm opinion the the layout of this 1000 page book should be changed."
1,This Zapped! lacked bite,"This movie made the first one seemed a campy classic. Well, the first one deserved to be a campy classic. ""Zapped Again"" the sequel is none of the above.Took place perhaps several years after the first one, Todd Eric Andrews played another nerd who discovered Scott Baio's stash of telekinetic prune juice in a secret compartment in the wall of his former lab. Meanwhile he is trying to start a science club while being harrassed by the jocks.With a cameo appearance by Linda Blair, the classic clothes ripping finale of the first movie was mentioned in passing. So does this movie ended with a high note as the first?No, not exactly. But let's say that in this movie, high school girls started wearing bras for a change and that guys can't no longer stuff their supposedly LONG tuxedo shirts into their skimpy underwear. Which means....the ending is a yawner.And so is this movie. It fail to live up to the first one.....which shouldn't be too difficult to begin with."
1,I Didn't Like It And It Had Nothing To Do With It Being Silly!,"I watched the first movie Zapped on Cable, I think it was on HBO or Cinemax or one of those other movie channels and I really liked it and found it very amusing but one day I was watching TV and this sequel called Zapped Again came on and I thought it was terrible and very disappointing and probably one of the worst sequels I have ever seen! And no I wasn't expecting a serious movie like The Shawshank Redemption or Citizen Kane. Seriously I think anyone who has seen the First Zapped movie and liked it knows that it was silly and that the sequel is likely to be silly too. I like silly movies so clearly that is NOT why I didn't like Zapped Again. I didn't like Zapped Again because I thought it was boring and was not as funny as Zapped! Actually I didn't find this sequel funny at all."
1,"Yes, it stinks",That about sums it up. The most interesting thing about this film is the uncanny similarity between the voice and delivery of star Todd Eric Andrews and David Spade. But we already have one and we don't need another.
3,A bit unnecessary,"This drinking tube attaches to thePlatypus 2L Reservoir(or any of their other reservoirs), and works by suction. Water should only come out when you suck on it. The shut off valve is the little yellow thing, and just acts as a lock to prevent water from coming out. I can't really see why that is necessary since the regularPlatypus Drinking Tubeworks just fine and I didn't really have a problem with water leaking out of it. Unless you're using your reservoir as a shower or something, this is a waste of money. I didn't notice any unusual taste either."
1,Not much fun,"Only the top half of the numbers on the screen can be read. Even though the screen is large, the game is difficult to play since the numbers are so difficult to see."
2,Not As Expected,"I typically love Daniel Green slippers but this one wasn't as I expected. I was looking for a very cushiony bootie slipper that would be super cushiony around my ankles as well as on the sole of my foot. Although the slipper has an outdoor sole, the bottom of your foot is supported by a layer of the bootie's soft fabric, a very thin layer of cushion and the rubber sole; all-in-all, they're not very cushiony. The slippers were snug but I like them that way."
1,Not what expected.,"I just assumed the fuzzy slipper shown would be fuzzy inside as it looks - wrong! While the outside of the slipper is fuzzy - the inside is a thin layer of material and you can feel the sole of the slipper through the thin bottom. To be comfortable one would need to wear socks for warmth. Also, if this is terry cloth - it's very thin cloth. Not a great buy."
1,Bootie top too small and tight,"Unfortunately in order to get my foot into this bootie, I would have had to force it. And I could see that eventually the opening might tear. So, I had to return it."
4,Wife is very happy,Got a pair for my wife. The sizing seems just a bit on the small side. They are also very snug to get her heel into them when putting them on. They are nice slippers and seem to be holding up well.
3,Hard to Put On,"The slippers are good quality but there is very little give in the ""neck"" of the bootie and I have to wrestle to get it on. Usually I just walk around with the back crushed down."
2,Daniel Green Slippers,"I bought this producct on the basis of the reputation of Daniel Green slippers, however, when I received them I was disappointed. I did not think they were worth the cost. I was looking for something that would keep my ankles warm and these slippers are not substantial enough to do the job. They look very nice, but they are too thin to remain around my ankles when I put them on. I expected something heavier. Even the sole was not heavy enough for me to be able to wander around outside when I go to pick up the morning newspaper. I do not like to wear socks with my slippers so that was not a solution to my problem. the size was o.k. and the design is fun, but they are just not sturdy enough for me."
2,Daniel Green Women's ...,"The slippers looked so comfy but proved to be too small, even at 8 and half wide. Wish they had fit. The only replacement offered was leopard print at 9. No thanks."
1,Received two right-foot slippers,"My family has purshased many items over the years from Amazon, from books to TVs. This is the first item that we are unsatisfied with.Previous reviewers have said the top of the slippers are too tight. I ordered a pair on the larger side for my wife in anticipation of this potential problem and they were still too tight - but OK. Next, my wife said they didn't feel right and kept switching them from one foot to another. She soon discovered that we were shipped two right-footed slippers. Are you kidding me? Now I finally get time to return them and I find out that I have to return them on my dime because the ""return window is closed"". Comm'on I bought them for my wife for Christmas and it's only the beginning of February. I will never buy footwear from Amazon again. Too much risk and hassle. In the end, these slippers are not as nice as slippers you can buy at half the price just about anywhere."
4,Almost perfect,"These slippers are soft, warm, and very comfy. My only complaint is the ankle opening is a little narrow, making it difficult to pull them on over my heel. I can see how someone with diabetes or arthritis might have trouble. An extra half inch would be enough for me."
5,Best slipper ever,This is the best slipper ever. I love the softness and comfort. Diabetetes can cause sore feet and these cuddle my feet all day. They wash nicely and seem like new afterwards. The trick to getting them on easily is to get your toes all the way in and then gently pull up the heel with the handy loop.
3,Ok for the price,"Not the best slipper I have ever bought. They are a very pretty color (Lavender) but there just isn't enough cushion on the inside. You don't feel much under your foot and walking in them you feel the hard floor, so there isn't much warmth. They are a bit hard to put on and take off as the ""boot"" top doesn't stretch much, so if you are in a hurry to throw on your slippers, don't grab these unless you plan to sit and struggle getting them on. I have a small foot (sz 6) and I did order my size I just think it's the lack of stretch that prevents them for going on and coming off easy."
3,Daniel Green Women's bootie,I ordered the slippers in a 6 1/2 but had to reorder a 7 since they ran small
5,Bedroom slippers,The slippers were sent out very quickly. The slippers fit perfectly and the quality is great. Thank you.
2,I'm not even sure these aren't knockoffs.,"I have another pair of Daniel Green slippers in the exact same size, same style, etc. that I bought from a Daniel Green store. They are completely different in that they have a very cushy bottom and these don't, my others fit perfectly and these are a size too big and I've had the others for four months and they've held up great and the tab ripped off the back of these the moment I put them on. I don't know what the deal is, I'm just saying I wouldn't buy these again. Only from a Daniel Green store or [...] or something like that."
1,Don't last with hard use,"I purchased these slippers for my girlfriend for Christmas last year, need to say they no longer exist in this household. The quality is less than desired and the comfort is not worth the wait. If you don't do much around the house and just want something to keep your feet warm these are for you. But if you work around the house and take the dog out they won't last. Poor craftsmanship and the padding is less than expected. She didn't like these at all....."
3,exspensive,"I purchased these because I really thought that they would be better for the price. Not so with this purchase. I like them and they are nice and warm but, they are a little pricey for what they are. I would reccomend them to anyone who likes to have warm feet like me. The price could be better though, they are a little exspensive for a pair of slippers that I will only wear for one season. I did recieve them on time and they are very warm, the cushion is perfect. I did find that I had to put them in the dryer though to get all of the lint off of them, when I took them out of the box there was loose fuzzy's everywhere. They are a very nice slipper though."
1,comfy silppers,"These slippers are typical of Daniel Green products, beautiful, comfortable and affordable.Thanks"
3,impractical fit,"For a slipper, this item is on the expensive side. When it arrived, I thought it looked well made, however, so I went ahead and gave it to my mother-in-law. She could not get her foot to slide into the shoe (though it was the size she normally takes) because of a band around the ankle of the sllipper which prevented her heel from sliding into it. There was no stretch to the band or unfastener to aid the process either. I had to return the slippers and buy something else."
3,Comfortable and warm,"These are nice, but nothing out of this world. I think they are a little pricey - it's not like they have anything up on other slippers that are cheaper. The PLUSES: 1.) well-constructed. 2.) The rubber soles don't scuff like some other slippers I have had. (no black marks on my floor at least) 3.) VERY warm and comfortable.The MINUSES: 1.) cost - $30 for a pair of slippers?? - a bit much! 2.) these run small! Most definitely buy the next size up from the size you normally wear. 3.) If you have a wide foot, look at another pair. Fortunately, I don't have a wide foot, but if I did, I wouldn't be able to wear them w/o a foot corsette!"
5,nice slippers.,"yes ,cool leather .order half size upwell made. comfort. keep me dry. acceptable price .light weight and good quanlity"
1,BOO!!!! STAY AWAY!,"Ya know... I love Neil Young and I am an avid supporter of the free expressions Michael Moore always presents a rather ""dumbed down"" america even when I don't agree with his beliefs. BUT...DON'T BUY THIS SINGLE! STAY AWAY! It is the classic Neil Young song, which works well for the movie but this single is an exact copy of what we were given in the movie. I was expecting maybe some periodic jibes from Moore during the remix or some classic Bush-isms but all we are given is the final minute of dialogue from the movie (""fool me once.."") and then directly into the song. EXACTLY WHAT THE MOVIE DOES! Talk about trying to make a buck on a movie. like this movie needs it anyway! i support the movie, i support moore, i support young...I DO NOT support this single!!!!"
2,This is Chinese seiko!!!,"I bought this item and receive the chinese one . Not TITANUM!Please, a little think before order this ""seiko""!"
5,Bought as a gift but it certainly looks good.,"The only catch that i see is it's weight, which is above espected but, on the other hand, the person who received it as a gift loves the watch so... it deserver 5 stars for me.BTW, you can see titanium tags but i can't see any titanium in here..."
4,A Good Value For Money Watch,"I was browsing through amazon as well as many other sites to get hold of a good deal for a nice watch. Then, Seiko SNA283 appeared in my list. By seeing the images, I thought it was not bad, thought the images didn't do any justice to the real one. ( I have uploaded some images of mine ). And the price quoted was $130.Lookwise, its an excellent one. The only thing I could note as a let down is its weight. It may be because I was using a much lesser weighted one all these days.If you are looking for a good looking, elegant watch for a cheap price, you can bet on this one."
1,CLIPS DON'T HOLD,"I recently bought the new slim hangers, which are great, and needed clips to make some of them skirt hangers. I ordered Super Hold Clips and received them in a timely manner. As I was trying to attach skirts and slacks to them, they were slipping out. The few that stayed fell to the floor as soon as I hung the hanger in my closet. The product doesn't have a spring strong enough to hold anything to the hanger. I returned them and definitely would not recommend them."
4,Best Bag Clips,"These are the best bag clips in my pantry. They are the perfect size to hold close the chips bag, marshmellow bag or any other type of bag in your pantry. I even use them in my freezer for the large vegetable bags and the veggies don't get frost bite!"
1,Coasters,"Bought a 50 TDK-DL spindle. After 9 ""failed to burns"", I gave up. I thought something was wrong with my software or burner. Bought a small spindle of Verbatum online. First one burned perfectly and 5 more --so far without fail. I won't buy the TDK's again."
2,Poor,I've enjoyed other books by Loomis but this one just didn't go anywhere. If you take out all the pages spent complaining about the indignities rich people have to endure when traveling with poor people you'd loose 25% of the book. Less than half of what would be left would be the story. Pretty thin.
2,good start - bad finish,"The Pegasus Secret was engaging and well planned and a satisfying read. As the second book featuring Lang and Gurt, I anticipated a tight story line and the development of the main characters. The Julian Secret had a promising beginning and then began to abruptly fall apart at the end. This book feels as if the author rushed to finish to meet a publish deadline."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this book based on the Amazon reviews, which were mostly possitive. The story line is very interesting, unfortunately the main characters are not. Lang and Gurt are one-dimensional stereotypes whose lines are not worth reading. Because of this, I was unable to finish even a 100 pages of the book.If you're looking for engaging thrillers, try Lincoln Child & Preston Douglas' Pendergast books."
3,Not the best MLP toy,"This toy is very frustrating for my 3 year old.... it has 2 drawers to hold the accessories, and each drawer can really only hold 1 little thing without getting stuck! These drawers get stuck on a daily basis. Plus, the way it is set up for the ponies foot to open the drawers makes it hard to access & open.Cute toy - just poor design."
2,Not up-to-date!,"I bought this book to refresh my knowledge of SQL, especially the new stuff that has been added in the past few years, such as GROUP BY ROLLUP. THIS BOOK DOES NOT COVER RECENT CHANGES TO SQL FOR ORACLE."
5,Uncomfortably realistic,"As a divorced father of four daughters, I found some parts of the story ""Winter Father"" so real that it hurt to read them.""...that he did not even want a woman except at the day's end, and had borne all the other hours of woman-presense only to have her comfort as the clock's hands moved through their worst angles of the day"".These passages seem to come right from the heart. That's where they landed with me."
5,Don't miss this book!,"This book contains the most amazing stories that I have ever read. Dubus writes about people of all ages dealing with issues like death, religion, and relationships; yet this description isn't enough. His themes are huge, but not overbearing or contrived. You'll love his characters for both their flaws and their virtues, and learn something about yourself even from stories dealing with things you've never experienced. I can't describe his writing in any way that doesn't sound cliche; yet, reading his stories, even old themes are new again under his treatment. His characters are so real that I almost expect them to be living down the street from me; without crushing the reader under unnecessary details, Dubus gives his characters a sense of past and reality that is unlike the ability of any other writer I have come across. I can't say enough about this book; don't pass it up. Dubus is amazing."
3,THIS IS NOT THE FRENCH VERSION,"This is erroneously listed as ""Don Carlos,"" leading one to believe that this is the French version of the opera, rather than ""Don Carlo,"" the Italian version. Amazon should correct the listing as ""Don Carlo."""
2,"I Really Wanted to Love these, BUT...","Why is it so hard to find a good waffle weave dishcloth that will dry out quickly and is also colorful? I wanted to love these, but alas, I find the dye really does run and run (unlike one other reviewer's experience). After seeing oceans of red dye running in my sink and smudging the walls I wiped, I pre-washed the others in the pack in the washing machine, hoping that would dispense with the excess dye. But it didn't. Sorry, but it gives me the willies seeing all that flowing dye in contact with the plates and utensils we eat from and on the counters where we prepare food."
2,Great for thie first 6 months,"I really liked these at the beginning. After six months or so they started to feel greasy. Even after soaking in bleach and washing in hot water, they had a greasy feel. I am going to have to order some other type because of the way they feel."
4,GREAT SINGER WITH MANY GOOD SONGS,"Well, this is a good country-pop CD, with good singing, songs, and production. One big problem is the low sound level, both on the downloads and the actual CD that I got. Also, I wrote to her, and never got a reply! RIDE LITTLE COWGIRL, and the song about an unwanted baby are her best."
3,Even I liked it better than LeAnn Rimes,I have been calling the radio stations and they don't have Mercedez on up here enough yet.She is better than that LeAnn Rimes for sure.
3,Billy's matrix moves,One of my friends recommended me to watch this movie if i'm into mixed martial arts with some matrix moves added to it. I watched it and it was not that bad. The story was quite remarkable and the special effects made it more enjoyable till the end. I wouldn't rate this movie as a number #5 but it wasn't that bad either to get a #3 rating according to me and some of my friends.
1,I've seen better; save your money,"I saw it on TV last night. I didn't see ""The Matrix"" or ""Crouching Tiger"", so I can't compare it to those. To me it was more like ""Highlander"" meets ""Mutant X"", but in a bad way. The repetitive voice overs had to go, but the special effects were cool. Maybe it should have been anime."
2,Invincible DVD Purchase,"When I recieved the DVD there was a hole punched in the front of the case. The DVD itself wasn't damaged, but the case looks horrible with the hole, which is a shame since I bought it as a collector item for my boyfriend. I assume it happened during shipping, since it was shipped in an envelope. I won't purchase another dvd, or cd for that matter from Amazon."
2,Just Because Of Billy Zane!!!!....,"I'm not a fan of martial arts movies except for old Bruce Lee movies. While at my local video store, I saw this DVD on sale for cheap. What caught my eye was BILLY ZANE!!!! He was the only reason I bought this movie. Had he not been the lead character in it, I would have never bought this movie. I give the movie 2 stars but BILLY ZANE and his performance 5 stars!!!!! Although executive produced by Mel Gibson along with Jet Li, unless you are a die hard martial arts/The Matrix fan, I wouldn't advise watching this movie unless like me, you want to see it only for Billy Zane! He was pretty good at martial arts and played the character of Os very well. He trains a group of students to take on his enemy ( Slate ) and save the world. Each student possesses special powers and all work together to do battle against the Shadowmen. The goal is to save mankind. Good special effects. Again, a good movie for martial arts/fantasy movie fans."
3,"laughable, but in a wierd way, unique","This movie was funny. The special effects are really good and the martial arts is simular to Crouching Tiger and Matrix. GREAT ACTION. But..... the acting was so corny, I thought I was watching a b-movie. The diolouge is so dumb and the story was hard to follow and fruity. It's about some tablet that falls upon earth. Some guy Slate finds it but some dude named Os battles Slate's Shadowmen and gets one half of the tablet. So now Os must gather a group of defenders and he trains them to become loveable warriors to defeat the Shadowman! While Slate tries to recover Os half of the tablet to bring upon the end of humanity! A hard to follow movie! I would of liked this film better if it were a Japanese movie. But the movie ain't a trainwreck, it just needs better direction!"
3,Not bad but,Gun is ok. The handle is a little to small and is squared off and not round on the edges
3,Good but no feeling,"This is like a Grisham story; all action and no characterization. While the premise was good, the story was typical of this ink. Unfortunately, I couldn't feel for the main characters. Sure, Jesse had to wear women's clothes but the whole transitioning was just glossed over with very little in-depth thoughts. Nice for quick read but no substance."
1,If you're trying to prepare for the American Lit Clep....,"The other review on this book by ""a reader"" is very helpful and I recomend you read it as well as this review. I have taken fifteen CLEP tests and am very familiar with how to study for the test. CLEP tests by their very nature a designed to see if the student has a sufficient grasp on the given subject. On tests like American literature or Humanities which cover a wide variety of different works/toppics, I've found that it's best to study the main points and key elements of the subject instead of spending a whole year trying to read a huge list of books. I would not recomend Rudman's book, however, I would recomend buying the Barron's EZ key's for American Literature. It will help you get a quick grasp on what this subject covers. Also, the Official Clep study guide is a great tool for preparing for the tests."
2,"Not the best, but helpful for CLEP","This book does cover alot of information not needed for CLEP, but it does give you a great guideline on who and what to study for clep and good examples on what questions will look like for the actual clep.I wanted to ensure I was prepared for the clep, so I purchased this book and disregarded the other 2 comments. Although, they were right about the obscurity, this book still taught me alot.You don't necessarily need it, but if you want to be prepared, this book will not hurt your bank account that much. I also recommend The Complete Itiots Guide to American Literature (5 stars, check out the reviews), and the Internet. That is all you need."
1,Poor move...no value,"no value...only people showing their asses and bodies. I do not know what's the category of such a movie...but I know it is Not funny. See actors in the movie, u feel like u r watching ur 10 years old kid on the school stage. music is poor so is filming."
1,This is one foul-mouthed movie!,"If you are a Christian, or even a normal American I'd steer far from this movie. This is a foul-mouthed and porn extravaganza from beginning to end.I hope foreignors do not think that this is the sort of talk that goes on in normal American businesses. Normal educated American males do not normally think and dwell on sex like this, or talk like this about females. Also, I can't believe the U.S. Congress is sitting still while Hollywood passes this sleazy, depraved and vulgar movie off as ""Unrated"". Unrated is guaranteed to attract those innocent and uneducated about this movie. Something the mongers in Hollywood are hoping for."
1,Can you give 1/2 stars?,"This movie was so hyped up, and unrightfully so. I read the reviews (which seemed positive) and knew that it would be somewhat raunchy, but not as profanity-strewn as it was. There are some funny parts, but they seemed contrived. The famous chest-waxing scene was just not that funny. Read the other reviews to find out what the plot was, but be forewarned. This movie may get on your nerves fast, and you may want to block your ears to some of the dialogue. It could've been so much memorable, and not the sick dud that many will find it to be."
1,this movie is painful,This movie is painfully not funny. I was amazed that there are parts where they unabashedly rip off Deuce Bigelow. Stupid. Anyone who would give this more than two stars is pretty funny.
3,LOVED IT!!! WAS FUNNY!!,"I really liked this movie...let me tell u why...I think this is second funniest movie in 2005 after ""WEDDING CRASHERS"" But this movie put it that way if u in ur mid 30s and up u would love this movie because only made for mature audience and people in their 30s and up would like and real funny and related to this movie. Well I really liked it and laugh my butt off. But most of all, I love ""WEDDING CRASHERS "" that movie real damn funny..I was almost tears coming out my eyes...anyway I LOVED both movies and I pre-order them both UNRATED versions and CANT WAIT!!.. Don't miss it..BUY OR RENT THEM BOTH!! A+"
3,Somewhat funny,"This was a gift to us. It had it's funny moments but it was very dirty. The usual potty humor that anyone can come up with. Something that is truly funny rarely needs potty humor to sell. I gave it 3 stars because it did have it's funny moments. If you like silly potty humor than by all means, make the purchase or go rent it & see what you think."
3,"Cancel my appointments, I need more wax!","Steve Carrell stars as a very nerdy, naive guy that works in an electronics store, collects vintage toys and loves video games. He doesn't even know how to drive and rides a bike--bicycle, not motorcycle. His male co-workers invite him to a poker game and it is there they discover that he is still a virgin at 40. The rest of the movie centers on trying to get their friend ""with a woman"". This film is absurdly funny and makes you laugh in parts---such as when he gets his chest waxed or when he attempts to put on ""protection"". In the end he gets the girl he wanted in the first place, despite his friends good intentions to hook him up. I wouldn't call this the best comedy ever by no means, but it was so stupid, it's funny and entertaining. It is not recommended for kids because of the subject content."
1,Awful movie!,I have to say that The Wedding Crashers is a whole lot better than 40 Year Old Virgin. When I saw 40 Year Old Virgin it felt like I was watching another American Pie movie where people are trying to score with woman. Sure there are some funny jokes but the rest of the movie just sucks. It's not worth the money. Go see Wedding Crashers instead!
2,Disappointing,"I had heard so many good things about this movie - that it was funny, and watching it ""you won't stop laughing"". As I watched it with my friends, I was struck at the number of minutes that would pass by - with no laughter. The movie has an interesting premise, but for a two hour movie, this stretches it. There are too many extraneous characters, and too many moments where the script and direction try to squeeze out as much humor as possible, but fails. What should have been a tight, breezy comedy is stretched into two hours of mugging and ""ha ha aren't we funny?"" type of film. The lead actor and Catherine Keener are charming but too much time is given to the supporting characters, some who are funny, some not. Also, the film tends to become repetitive with the lead character being prodded by his friends to lose his virginity and various situations ensue. It become stale and boring. I wanted to like this film more but it didn't do it for me."
1,Puzzled,"After sitting through about 95% of this film, I finally gave up and went to bed (my wife retreated 10 minutes earlier). We were puzzled by the critical raves that this film received. I wasn't expecting a comic masterpiece but this was excruciating dull. A few titters (no, not those) or chuckles was about all you got. As the movie was playing, my son who is 22 entered the room. I asked his opinion and he shrugged and said ""bathroom humor"" and left. Normally this isn't a bad review for him but he said it in such a bored way I could tell that he was disappointed with this film. Some Amazon reviewers seem to think that the unrated version hurt the film. I have to agree that the cutting of any time from this film had to be a blessing."
1,"It's rude, too much obscene.","This film insults women, a lot.If you want to show such obscene scenes a lot, turn it to be polno.I came to be fan of Steven since I watched his another work.But this film really disappointed me.And Steven's coworkers really take care of him to sleep with someone.But actually I doubt there're such a nice guy in the world.But if there were, it's wonderful.Steven's girlfriend is funny and nice.She is always arguing with her daughter who wants to sleep with her boyfriend."
4,"Funny movie, why tack on romace?","Truly a funny and well made comedy, not sure why they tack on romantic comedy angle (just like Wedding Crashers!), but definitely a good film."
2,America is starved for entertainment,"And I can prove my headline. This film was successful. That is all that I need to say. It isn't a bad film. But it doesn't deserve the popularity it received. Plus it is a direct rip-off from Ben Stiller movies. I see a lot of comedies placing crazy ethnic characters in them. These actors seem to be degrading themselves and do they realize people are mocking them by placing them in these parts? Because it is funny to hear an Indian guy cuss and talk graphically about sex. For a more extreme example of that, see ""Harold and Kumar Go TO Whitecastle"". That one is even worse than this one. Those actors may as well paint their faces black and put white circles around their mouths."
2,Overated,"Why was this so critically acclaimed?!? This is little more than a horny teenager movie with adults playing the roles - minus good T&A - don't let the 'unrated' marking mislead you. The characters are all interesting enough, but this movie is way too long and is plagued by awkward dialogue soaked in gratuitous profanity (Who do they think they are? Richard Pryor? they are not.) Steve Carell's character is so pathetic that you may be able to watch this as you would watch a 2 hr. 13 min. train wreck. However, The 40-Year-Old Virgin is not funny, not mature, not intelligent, and not very interesting."
2,"Overrated, overlong and predictable","It's hard to believe tripe such as this is considered good comedy. THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN relies on gross-out conduct and over-the-top shenanigans in place of wit, and the result is aimed strictly at the lowest common denominator. There are some good laughs provided by the supporting characters, but the rest of the movie just goes on and on and on about such obvious circumstances like problems with condoms, male cowardice when confronted by aggressive females, drunk-driving (hardly a joke when you consider how many people have been killed by such idiots) and other absolutely unbelieveably contrived situations.If you want genuine humor, check out classics like THIS IS SPINAL TAP, TOP SECRET!, or even SCHOOL OF ROCK. This flick is just a waste of time."
2,Ending So Weak,I'm not going to get into the description of the movie considering so many has done so before I. So I just want to point out that this movie was pretty good till the point of the ending. Why do filmmakers make weak endings? Is it because they have no more ideas or they just don't care? It just ruins the whole movie!
4,Terrific Comedy,"Definitely, this is one funny terrific film. I enjoy the chemistry between Steve Carell and Catherine Keener. It showed that you can wait for the right person to fall in love with and to commit fully to that person. No hurry for happiness that will last for the rest of your life. Terrific film. No regrets."
3,Great Movie - Horrible DVD,"This movie is hilarious, I loved it.Unfortunately, there are about 15 minutes worth of previews at the beginning of the DVD that it will not allow you to skip or fast foward through. I dont mind that stuff if I buy a used one from Blockbuster, but to torture me with forced advertisements on a DVD I buy brand new is unacceptable to me. Even DISNEY got away from that stuff and now lets you skip the preview BS on their DVD's now.The movie itself, 5 star. The DVD, 1 star."
2,"Some laughs, but obvious and mean-spirited","This could've been a great movie, but wound up being mean and hateful, with no really likeable characters (except the always-terrific Catherine Keener and Jane Lynch). Perhaps it was the relentless profanity in the unrated version? I didn't see the original, so can't compare. I thought that Andy's character was seriously undermined by his meanness. I didn't feel for him at all.The other problem is that there just isn't a lick of subtlety to be found. For example, the chest-waxing scene seems to be quite popular, but why? Andy's reaction to each piece of tape was exactly the same. Couldn't Carell think of some way to vary his responses?The movie doesn't know if it wants to be ""American Pie"" or ""Revenge of the Nerds"" (both great flicks).Oh well, only $10 gone. :-)"
1,"boorish, cheap, risqué, uncouth","This is one of the worst movies, I have ever seen. The director (Judd Apatow) clearly has a talent to direct a porn movie. I always believed that there is thin line between vulgarity and humor, and this movie has crossed that line. In the quest to make a comedy for entertainment, the director ended up filling the movie with filthy language, and obscene jokes. This movie may appeal to some youngsters, but certainly anyone with decent sense of humor won't find it amusing. I won't recommend any one to see this movie, let alone the idea of buying a DVD!"
1,Slow moving and vulgar,"My first exposure to Steve Carell's work was ""Get Smart."" My family enjoyed this movie very much and so we started to search for other movies. The 40 Year Old Virgin was the 2nd movie we attempted to watch. This movie was agonizing slow moving through tiring and vulgar scenes. The vulgarity was so offensive, we had to stop the movie perhaps before it became funny.I paid a penny for this DVD and it was under $5.00 with shipping and handling--even that was overpriced."
2,i didn't like it,"I watched the whole movie because i found it interesting.The only funny parts in the movie were what his buddies did.During the course of the movie, I found the most of the scenes almost hardto watch. And it was not that funny, i hardly laughed.If there was a naked chick in the tub telling you to get in i think you'd know what you would do. I thought it was funny though when his friend got in the tub with her after everyone else left.anyway 2/5 stars because the story was not that bad.I just thought the main character was too pathetic to be real and the movie wasn't that good overall, sorry."
2,Eight minutes,"The title alone convinced me to never watch this movie, but then a buddy loaned it to me.The premise does work. You see how this guy lives, and he's credible as a character and as a virgin. I love his bicycle, and I haven't driven anything with a motor since moving to Asia in December 1999, so I notice such things.However, the humor just wasn't funny. Very lame, pre-teen, predictable. He's surrounded by stereotypes, and really isn't he one too? I found it impossible to care, so I watched something else.But hey, two stars. That is one more than I expected to give. Way to go movie!"
2,Remarkably unfunny and way too long,"How many stupid, sexual, frat boy jokes does it take to fill a 2-hour movie? That must have been the question on the minds of the makers of ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin."" I will say that Steve Carell did pull off a very convincing loser. It was actually too convincing -- he stopped being funny and was simply pathetic.I was bored out of my brain. Not being a fan of people that have to overact to get a laugh I was disappointed by the whole movie. The movie moved at such a slow pace that you could leave the room and come back twenty minutes later and not feel that you had missed anything. The scene where he takes his girlfriend's daughter to the clinic was embarrassing to watch. And not funny embarrassing. I'm glad I saw this on DVD (that someone else paid for) instead of paying good money to see it at the theatre."
4,Hilarious,"40 year old virgin is a great movie. It's hilarious and isnt afraid to be risque. In the end it's two kind of movie, a sweet romantic movie and a 90s sex comedy. Also it's great if you like the musical Hair. Well worth $10."
4,Definately funny,"This movie is between 4 and 5 stars. Its definately hilarious, and even does a good job incorporating some serious aspects to it, but there's nothing that puts it over the top to be exceptional.Definately very very funny and a good watch. Lots of great moments/lines. Good characters."
5,awesome,got this for my brother for christmas. shipped very quickly and arrived as was described! such a funny cool movie
2,Where's the FUNNY version?,"I've only seen 40 Year Old Virgin on video, and I've been kicking myself in the nads ever since I realized that waiting out the theatrical release becuase ""it'd be just as good on video"" was a huge mistake. I'll neve know if this movie was originally good or not. The bloated, formless version we have on DVD has some great parts, but they're buried in cut bits that should never have been put back in. I mean, they could have put out a longer version for hard core fans, but gee whillakers--put out the version that was a big hit in theatres too! When I watched the DVD the fat and repetition was just painfully obvious; there was no forward momentum and jokes repeated themselves.PLEASE release the original theatrical version!"
3,A Directorial Failure,"Steve Carell can be a good actor, witness his performance inLittle Miss Sunshineand he receives some great support here from Catherine Keener and Romany Malco, but somehow it just doesn't work. The idea behind the film is tenuous, and is made even more so by modeling the hero on Pee Wee Herman (grown man rides bicycle, collects action figures). Carell simply comes across as being silly.There are some uproariously funny scenes, which justify the time worth watching the film, but like a Chinese dinner, you'll feel empty an hour later."
2,Vulgar vulgar vulgar funny obscene vulgar,"And did I mention vulgar. This movie is a little bit funny, but painfully obscene. The language is so bad, I had to leave the room. But my brother and sister thought it was hysterical. I guess if you don't mind this sort of thing, you might enjoy this movie."
3,"OK, but don't expect a lot of laughs","This movie was just ok as far as entertainment value goes. If you saw the trailer you already have seen all the laughs in it. The premise seems to be the more a guy is into toys, comic books and basic collectible items (the main character likes to hand paint toy soldiers and rides a bicycle for transportation), the less likely he will ever make it with a girl. A likeable electronic salesman who is all those things has never had any relationship with a woman. His work buddies realize this and try to do everything they can to get him ""hooked up."" He has to make a big choice in his life because if he does go through with actually having a relationship, he will have to give up most of the things that he loves.I found this movie to be okay to kill and hour and a half but it is definitely not even in my top 100 comedy films list."
3,somewhat,"This film was ok. It wasent a laugh out louud comedy even though it was funny at times. I wouldnt realy buy the dvd, just wait until it comes on regular tv or one of those HBO or showtime chanels."
4,pointless yet good for a laugh or 2 or... 120 or so,Steve Carrol was awsome and fit the part completely this movie really is a must see for comedy fans
4,"Surprisingly smart, wonderfully world-weary yet still romantic.","Although the title (and the basic plotline) make one expect an American Pie-style comedy, the 40-Year-Old Virgin is a surprisingly smart and clever comedy. Scratch that, a romantic comedy, which doesn't work on paper, but which is surprisingly sweet and funny (and fairly wise).A recommended viewing for fans of R-rated romantic comedy, of which this is one of only a small handful."
5,laughs galore,"I bought this movie for my boyfriend, he loved it so much. I dont think I have ever seen him laugh so much. Even his very conservative father liked the movie I would totally recomend it to anyone."
5,EXCELLENT!,"If you're a lover of COMEDY with sexual references...THIS IS THE MOVIE TO HAVE in your collection! Non-stop laughing, outrageous moments, and lots of MAN-related comedy."
2,DVD should not have added scenes,"This version dragged badly. I watched this and the 1940's ""Miracle of Morgan's Creek"", back to back. Interesting contrast. Virgin had no censorship concerns, yet Miracle was funnier while ducking the censors' wrath."
4,Good buy,Very funny movie. This is something I can watch over and over again. I would definitely reccomand to a friend.
5,Classic comedy,This is one of those movied that I have to have in my collection as it's one of the few you can watch over & over. I tend to wait to buy physical media and in this case I was able to pick it up fro $5. Well worth the wait.
5,Simply brilliant,Steve Carrell and Jane Lynch are magic. I love this movie and am considering buying it! I definitely recommend this movie.
1,"Awful, boring, disastrous","This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. There is no fun at all. It's a complete no-sense story, with scenes endlessly boring. What a waste of time!"
1,Great Movie if they Cut it down to 60 mins,"This movie would have been great if they cut it down to 60 mins. It started out well. The interactions between the clerks at the electronics store was hilarious. Some of the dialogue, especially with the Indian clerks was classic. The premise behind the story was slightly original and different. But the director has to learn when to call it quits.. some of the scenes in the middle just went on and on and on.. Towards the end , I was about ready to pull my hair out."
3,Remind Me Not To Watch This Movie Again...,"PARENTS, do not let your children watch this movie. It will make them blind. This movie was HILARIOUS! But it depended on it's dirty jokes and graphic nudity to make you laugh. There is a 40 Year Old Virgin who tries to learn how to loose his virginity...but soon, later on, he meets a woman (who you can call a ""grandmother"" cause her daugher has a daughter) and you can guess what happens beyond that point.The beginning of the movie will make you burst out laughing. That was a weird way to start the movie. Do not watch this if your real young. It's a dirty movie."
1,Horrible,"This movie was the worst thing I've seen in years. It's laden with cuss words (obviously an attempt to supplement a virtually non-existent storyline). I enjoy most of these comedies with Will Ferrell, Owen brothers, Vince Vaughn, etc, but this one was absolutely horrible. There are a few funny scenes but the story was crap. Don't waste your time or money on this flop."
3,Funny but...,This movie had some very funny moments. Overall I am not dissapoined but I would not put it up there with something like Wedding Crashers. Good to rent but don't buy it.
2,Would make a sailor blush,"Basically a great love story of two lonely people finding each other after a disappointing life. However, excessive use of 4 letter words distract from the story plot. In fact, if the first half of this movie were censored, it would be a silent movie. I'd give it 4 stars were it not for the excessive swearing."
3,uneven but funny,"Unless you've been living under a rock, you know the basic plotline. Andy is the ""40 Year Old Virgin"" of the title and his ""friends"" (actually work buddies, they never seemed to be friends prior to the card game) conspire to help him lose his virginity.Some of it is funny, but the language dampened that for me. I know people use ""f***"" frequently, but is it really necessary for it to be almost every other word?Lots of the scenes were forced - for instance, couldn't his future wife figure out something was going on with him? I mean, if her daughter did, why couldn't she? And the scene where she goes to his apartment and starts snooping around and becomes all terrified that Andy is going to kill her - where did that thought come from?I think this was good to watch once, but definitely not a keeper in my opinion."
5,Funniest movie ever!,This movie is possibly the funniest movie ever. It also has a great message within it. Best one liners in a long time.
2,The fine line between retarded and funny,"For all the hype, this is a HUGE disappointment. Situational comedy is one thing but stupid is another. (At least it wasn't as bad as The Anchorman, Meet the Parents, or Wedding Crashers.) The movie is mostly painful with brief flickers of humor. For anyone who is really going to buy this DVD, I have a bridge for sale you might be interested in . . ."
3,"Good movie, plenty of laughs, but nothing spectacular","I just finished watching this movie and thought ""That was pretty OK"", emphasis on OK.The movie borrows from the concept of that unique person making their way into present-day living and laughs result from the journey. While I have always favored ""loner type"" movies, this was a touch short of what I was expecting. Sure, there were a few times I laughed out loud, but it was over two hours long and I feel it lost its shock appeal by being too drawn out.On the good side, the lead actor, Steve Carell was an OUTSTANDING CHOICE! I can't readily think of anyone who could replicate his performance, it was truly awesome. Just enough Geek, enough Stud and a nice blend of Innocence made him shine. I can't believe he actually went through the chest waxing. I was wincing as I watched.Bottom line: This is a feel good movie. A bit long and watered down, but worth a watch."
4,"Even If You Dont Like Stupid Movies, Give This One A Try.",I am not personally a fan of stupid movies in the vein of Anchorman or Wedding Crashers but this stupid movie is worth a watch. Steve Carell's acting is fantastic and you don't question his pee-wee herman like acting. The story is decently original and there are a lot of great one liners. His supporting cast is also very good. For a stupid movie with the name 40 Year Old Virgin it does send a responsible message about not being ashamed to wait until marriage for having sex. If you watch this movie you arent going to regret it. Give it a try on a lazy sunday.
5,The 40 year old Virgin,"It's a very funny movie,starring Steve Carell. He's a 40 year old man who can't seem to lose his virginity. It was written intelligently. Sure they are some gross out scenes but its all worthwhile in the end."
4,Laff Riot,"This is very funny...an almost perfect balance between gross out comedy and surpassing sweetness...Steve Carell is an extremely gifted comic actor, after all, he followed very capably in Ricky Gervais' footsteps...."
2,Be careful who you watch this with!,"Do not watch this with your kids - or your parents for that matter. I wish I knew this before I put this into my DVD player. Here we are - me and my mom, sitting comfortably on the couch and the first scene starts with the guy coming out of his bedroom with this HUUUUGE erection clearly visible through his boxers. I almost fell off the couch. So just a word of warning - be careful who you watch this with. The movie was okay, but to be honest I expected more humor and wit."
2,"Stank, and uncomfortable","Oh boy, people really loved this dumb thing. But why? It goes on waaaay too long at almost two hours. No modern Hollywood comedy should ever bore its audience for more than 90 minutes, tops! All the supposedly classic scenes here are just dumb and uncomfortable to watch, especially where Steve Carrell gets waxed. We have become a society of dummies if this is what gets classed as funny. I had never seen this before. Ick."
2,Some moments: just that,"I give the movie just two stars because it has some moments (just that, no more) where you REALLY laugh. However, overall, the premise of the story is basic and rehashed. The acting goes a bit over the top at times and most of the jokes did not even get me to laugh. As the movie approaches the end, it starts to get worse. It ends in an absolutely weird way that tops a movie that has very little to offer. Skip it. There are far better comedies out there."
3,second tier stupid comedy,"Not on the top echelon with old school or wedding crashers but definitely worth seeing. More puerile and genitalia focused than the other two. still, there are some funny funny scenes (e.g. chest hair waxing)"
1,"Worst Excuse For Comedy Since ""Ishtar""","I love a good laugh. Really I do. Unfortunately, I think I could've spent my $7.50 on a mallet and hit myself in the head several times and evoked more laughter than what I got when I saw this ripe pile of garbage in the cinema.I was excited when I first heard about this movie. I've always liked Steve Carell. In fact, I've considered him to be the best part of The Daily Show for years now... and he's turned the U.S. adaptation of The Office into more than just a weak ripoff. Alas, his talents are wasted here.The film is one overblown sex joke and I don't mean in a subtle, witty fashion like The Wedding Crashers. The material is as subtle as a kick to the groin and the jokes are as weak as tissue paper. I'd give it no stars at all, but that isn't an option on this site.Avoid this movie at all costs."
1,"A very, very ugly movie!","A predictable, ugly bore of a movie. The protagonist, Andy, seems like a nice enough guy but he lets his friends talk him into so many weird things, like hair waxing, that one has to wonder if this guy is playing with a full deck.The most prevalent characteristic of the movie is not its predictability, which is obvious as soon as you see this one particular woman, but it is the language. Why is it necessary to use vulgarity in every scene. It doesn't advance the plot, doesn't provide background for understanding the characters, it does nothing except turn the entire movie ugly and make it one long bore.Once I started watching the movie I felt that I had to see it through to find out why people would be praising it, but I never found out why, and wasted a couple of hours that would have been enjoyed better by watching grass grow.A very, very ugly movie."
2,Not as good as everybody makes it out to be!!,This movie was not as good as everybody made it out to be. It was very stupid and I found it hard to sit and watch through the whole thing. I will try to watch it again to see if I really like it but so far I would have to rate it as a two. Sorry to all the people that love this movie but it sucked.
1,highly overated,"i was really disappointed in this movie after all the hype that has been coming down the pipe. i am not a prude but if there is foul language or nudity it MUST be part of the story. at least for me. if this movie ever makes it to t.v. people will scratch their heads and look at each other in amazement since they will have to chop it to pieces. i am taking a lot of flak because of my opinion. but that is all this is, my opinion. i just got really tired of all the language and the lead player. to me he was just tiresome and while paul rudd is one of my favorite actors, he was wasted in this one. sorry, but to me this is just no good at all. no redeeming features at all. but i can certainly see why it would be a great movie to some of the straight men out there."
4,Sophomoric but funny,"This was absolutely hilarious. Yes, there were some weak points- the girl at the bookstore was an unrealistic sex machine and the vomiting scene was gross, but so what? It was a comedy that was funny, and that all that matters. I knew guys from high school that were like Carell, so I felt the movie was realistic. By the end of the movie I was sticking for Andy to get some. A very good job done by cast,director, producer, et al."
3,Mixed Emotions,"An interesting combination of sappy (You've Got Mail) melodrama and raunchy humor. It's also interesting to learn that ""f---"" has replaced ""the"" as the most commonly used word in the English language. Not that I mind it's use when appropriate but the film could have been 10 minutes shorter had the ""F word"" not been used as a noun, adjective, verb, adverb, etc. in most every sentence. We didn't like this film nearly as much as the ""experts"" but it does have some funny moments and Steve Carell was excellent as was the rest of the cast.The single point of getting Andy ""laid"" was carried way too far, in my opinion. We liked it but could have loved it had it taken a somewhat higher ground."
1,"Long, crass, and not funny","At 2 hours and 15 mins, this movie is about 45 minutes too long. There are very few funny moments. Mostly, you feel sorry for Adam (Steve Carrell) because he is a pathetic loser. Also, everyone in the movie uses a 4-letter word in each sentence. I have no problem with swearing per se; the right word at the right time can be enormously funny. But this movie has gratutious swearing that is not funny."
1,The 40-Year-Old Virgin,"It's my first time to rate a movie and I just felt compelled to do it because seldom have I run into such a mediocre product of cinematography. I can think of many ways of spending money and time than to watch such trash. Poor acting, flimsy plot as well as unnecessary use of the 'f' word make this one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Period."
1,"Cheesy, boring, predictable","...and a pathetic waste of 2 hrs of my life that I will never get back.I watched this while visiting friends, and good thing because there's no way I would EVER pay money to waste my time like that.Juvenile use of 4-letter words, cheesy, sleazy, flat jokes--the only reason this movie made the money that it did was the undeserved marketing campaign.The title pretty much says it--a 40 yrs old guy who's socially inept and whose friends try to 'hook him up', supposedly having a hilarious time doing it.BO-RING! Why isn't there a NEGATIVE rating system here?AVOID at ALL COSTS--unless you are an early teen who still thinks juvenile sex jokes are funny."
3,"Disgustingly Funny, Yet Disappointing","This movie was a bit of a disappointment for me overall, especially considering the great premise- this is no Wedding Crashers.The comedy was strong in some places and weak in others, the cast is not the most beautiful one (no offence), and what you see on screen seems to be quite low budget. Some of the sex jokes were a little obvious, and there were a few race jokes which were actually funny and good natured.I did have my favorite moments but I'm afraid that's all they were, and they unfortunately don't make this a great movie- a barely good movie perhaps, but not a great movie. Shame really. I'd probably buy the DVD for the kinda hot looking daughter but that's it."
1,Deadly boring and gross waste of Steve Carell's talents,"I thought this was going to be a funny movie about a shy guy finally finding sex and true love. Instead it was an Animal House-kind of mindless, crude, dumb and boring string of tasteless scenes about a not-especially-shy guy with a bunch of really clueless friends who, if you are to believe the picture presented, are the least attractive, sexually alluring males on the planet, with a bunch of female friends and acquaintances who are equally crude and stupid. After about ten minutes of this film, the friend with whom I was watching it asked if we could find something better to watch. Later on, I went back and watched most of the rest of it, hoping that somehow it would improve or I would be able to see why it had gotten favorable reviews. No such luck. Do yourself a favor--if you have to see this movie, rent it and have something actually entertaining ready for backup. This was a waste of good talent like Carell and Catherine Keener."
2,2 Stars for the Ending Only,"This movie is full of vulgar language, and the writing is extremely demeaning to women. There were VERY few laughs, and the plotline was ridiculous. Why after 2 years of working together, do these guys decide to befriend Andy? How is it that Andy has a huge collection of action figures (including 46 GI Joes still in the box), and manages to hook up with a woman who sells stuff on Ebay for a living? He's Mr. Nerdy and Shy, yet suddenly becomes Mr. Outgoing Problem-solver for her kids. The movie was unrealistic and unnecessarily filthy.But as I said, the ending was cute."
5,Really enjoyed it,This was a great movie. It follows the life of a 40 year old virgin who just wants some action with the babes. His co-workers try to get him some the whole movie and he makes some good friends. And he ends up falling for a 40 year old Grandma as his friend sais she is one hot Grandma my Grandma looks Like Jack Palance. He Finally gets lucky on his wedding day. I like when he gets a big stack of Porn and sais he hates it. He is great everytime he gets with a girl and when he gets a waxing.
3,Reimburse me.,"I like a good dirty joke as much as anybody but when I see a movie where the actors are having more fun than I am, I question why I should be paying them instead of the other way around.In this film the division between what's really funny and what's un-funny, like being thrown up on, isn't clear. The people who made this know what is funny but they don't know what isn't. Strange.Oh heck, I guess it was worth the money to see a guy who looks like Jamie Farr having sex with Katherine Keener."
3,"Good Movie, Bad DVD","Maybe it's a problem with me, but I've heard of others though, so here we go. Even though it's supposed to be a widescreen DVD it seems to be zoomed in so that it becomes sloppy fullscreen anyway. I watched it on a normal tv with no zoom on or anything like that, and I got the fullscreen experience. Not the end of the world for a comedy film, but it was annoying.The movie itself is hilarious, although I agree with other reviewers that this new edition is too long, but overall good. I'd give this edition of the film a 4/5, and I have to subtract a point for the widescreen problem."
2,Over Hyped,"I rented this thinking I would buy it. Overall, I am glad I rented it first as I now will not buy this dvd as one view was sufficient. I was hoping it would be better. It had a few moments but was kinda boring the rest of the time."
4,Film That Turns Your Original Assumptions Around,"About a half hour into this flick I was tempted to turn it off. The movie was crude and it seemed like the makers of this film were engaging in a cynical exercise where the title character's smug co-workers were using his ""impediment"" as the grist for cruel jokes. The film changes direction about halfway through and it adopts the message that true love is better than lust. You come to realize the method of the filmmakers madness because it was necessary to show the crudeness of Andy's co-workers to expose Andy's sweetness. The film is helped immensely by a superb performance by Steve Carell as Andy that gives his character dignity and avoids caricature. This movie is not for everybody because of the graphic language and crude humor. If you can get past it you will be immensely entertained."
4,pretty funny,"I got this for a gift for my boyfriend Andy who looks like Steve Carell (and is a weatherman to boot). He loves stupid humor, this is right up his alley. I thought it was funny, not the funniest thing i ever saw but still a good movie so long as you're not looking for great cinema. have fun. :)"
1,40-Year-Old Virgin,"This film is too ""gross"" and ""foul"" for mature, educated, adults. My wife and I turned it off after 10 minutes and regret wasting our money on it."
2,Good talent wasted on adolescent humor!,"I rented this movie based on the advice of some guys at my work. The film has some wonderfully talented actors in it,but their talent is wasted on the pre-pubescent, potty-mouthed humor that seems to be searching for laughs. Films are funnier when they don't try so hard. The writers know nothing about subtlety, dramatic irony or creativity. The lines are blatantly sexist without any kind of redeeming moment. In fact, the whole film is an insult to females and men who strive to see women as more than just objects for their penises. Yes, the end of the film does try to project a message about that, but, by this point, it's too late. The watcher is already groveling in more sex humor than a B-rated college flick. If you like junior high boy's locker humor, than this one is for you. If not, do yourself a favor and read a good book."
2,Ouch- My virgin ears...,"I bought this movie because I heard it was hysterical. I was very disappointed. Although there were funny parts in the movie, I found that the ""F"" word and other vulgarities were used so frequently that it took away from anything that might have been amusing. I am not usually offended by swearing, but the behaviors in this movie were offensive."
1,a new low for humor *SPOILERS*,"capping this off quick, i was told ""you HAVE to see this movie - for the waxing scene alone! he ad-libbed all the lines during the scene, and the audience was rolling on the floor! it's so funny you won't believe it!'thank god i rented it before deciding to buy it. i watched this piece of crap w/o ONE laugh right up to the chest wax scene.the ad-libbed 'brilliance' was this:""motherf**ker! f**k me! in the a**hole! you sh**head!"". that's when i had finally had enough, and turned it off. if THAT can make audiences howl, then i realize how dumbed down humor has become. i don't think i've seen a ""comedy"" this bad since ""clifford"", and that's saying something."
5,Funniest Show Around,This movie has got to be one of the best!!! It is so funny. It will keep you entertained and in stitches throughout the movie. Great!!!!
1,Too much potty humor,"The main characters were good, but the supporting roles were just to weird for me. Who writes this stuff a 6 year old?"
1,If you love the F word you'll love this movie,"If you like prolific profanity especially the F word you'll love this movie. I have a Navy SEAL for a father and 3 brothers. I LIKE GUY MOVIES...trust me. This movie should have never been made. It was a complete waste of film. We bought it because we loved Steve in his other parts esp Bruce Almighty, but this movie is nothing like that. Not funny. You've seen all the funny parts on the commercials. Please rent this before you waste your money on it. Go rent/buy Tommy Boy or Major Payne and get a real laugh with comic genius at work.If you like to laugh at cussing....then you'll love this movie. I don't think constant cussing is funny. Richard Pryor needed a desk job."
5,Love this movie!!,"I love this movie! It was one of the funniest movies I've seen. All the actors did a great job. Some of the people who have reviewed this movie on Amazon are way too uptight. If you didn't enjoy it, you had the option of not watching it! No one put a gun to your head and forced you to sit through it, sheesh! Anyway, as I said, I thought it was way funny!"
1,Bad,"Poor performance 1 Poor performance 2 Poor performance 3 Poor performance4 Poor performance, Poor performance Poor performance Poor performance Poor performance Poor performance Poor performance"
3,Not great condition,"In my opinion, selling a used dvd on Amazon would make someone believe it is in decent condition- why would you sell it otherwise? The condition said ""good"" and I figured it was just used, but the disc skips in 2 or 3 places."
4,Very Funny Very Cute,I found this movie to be very funny and very cute at the same time. Steve Carrell nales his part as the embarressed virgin he makes it very beleivable. His buddies are also perfect in there roles. I would highly suggest this movie for a good laugh.
5,The 40-Year-Old Virgin,This movie was very clever. I was expecting a movie that was somewhat humorous and got a movie that I was laughing out loud. I don't want to say this is the greatest movie ever but it is definitely worth seeing!
3,it it good,"I think it is a cute movie. I have a good time when I watched it. Don't get me wrong, It is not the best comedy but it has its moments that you can really laugh and enjoy it. The end was kind of weird... but... it was the end... so... it was ok..."
3,It's Alright,This was dumb at some moments and other moments it was funnier then heck. It is also a little to long for a comedy and that makes the movie boring at some points. I recommend buying this only if you like comedies that do not take themselves serious and to other people rent it do not buy.
3,funny but extremely long,"i started this movie and i was laughing my butt off. i thought this was going to be the comedy to kill me. the circumstances everyones in, the dry humor, everything was great. later into the movie it started to slow down...way down. it was as if they where making all of these jokes then they said 'oh crap! we have to finish the story!'. then spent another hour and fifteen minutes doign so. became a little bored with it. definatly worth seeing but not more than once or twice."
2,I wanted to like this movie,"The movie had a good beginning, but man - what a crappy finishing. One reason might be the length - this was a 2 hour movie. No comedy needs to be 2 hours.I'd expect a re-edited verson to score much better. There were some real funny moments in the beginning third/half, but the latter parts really sucked the fun out of this one..."
3,"Funny Movie, but I don't understand Amazon on this one.","I love Amazon's price for this movie and it is a great movie. The only weird thing is that when it arrived in the mail, Amazon had shipped me a Canadian version of the movie. It had the Canada leaf symbol on the spine, and had everything written in both English and French , making the spine of the movie almost unreadable it was so small to fit it all. Even the distributer for the movie is located in Canada. What confuses me though is why Amazon here in America would be selling this version IN AMERICA. It was shipped from Tennessee by Amazon. Yes Amazon, not a 3rd party. And I live in Texas. No where near Canada. I don't know if they have a lot more like this that Amazon has, but just know there is a chance to get a Canadian release of the movie. I am sure it is the same and nothing wrong with it, it just looks funny with multiple languages, and I'd rather have the American release anyways, so I plan on returning it."
4,The best of the Apatow Factory comedies,"4.2 starsVirgin was the first, and still the best, of the now-ubiquitous Apatow buddy comedies. Carell is perfect, as is the script he wrote with Apatow. Rogen and so many of the other guys in every subsequent Apatow production are here, but somehow a little more likeable, and a lot funnier.There are some truly hilarious scenes, and most all of the bit parts are very well-cast and played. Carell ain't afraid to laugh at himself and that's what makes this work; no one could have played this role better, and he's twice as funny here as in The Office (watch the original BBC version, specifically epsiode 4!).A very effective comedy not afraid to get a little raunchy but never too much, Virgin will probably be the one Apatow feature still considered hilarious in twenty years."
4,Catherine Keener is annoying,"The 40 year old virgin is a very funny movie, as long as you don't mind vulgar and obscene language and situations. I only have two complaints. First, Catherine Keener. Oh how I wish she was not in this movie. Just to let you know, she laughs, not acts, through the whole film. She laughs like an idiot through every scene. I guess she was hoping that her pretty smile would cover up her lack of talent and/or ability to give the role any depth. The other thing I didn't like was the part at the end where everyone was dancing. This scene goes on for way too long and is far from funny. Other than those two things the movie is great. I highly recommend it."
4,"Funny, stoopid and very watchable","This movie is funny! For fans of ""The Office"", there is some similar type humor. This is well-written. The story is dumb, but that is what comedies are usually about. I laughed out loud a lot, which I rarely do in movies.There is a lot of good nudity, so prudes should skip this one. I am not sure why there was so much but it is mostly appropriate and I think adds to the overall effect of the movie.It is rather long for a comedy but does not seem too long as the movie flows nicely.There are some great one-liners back and forth such as ""do you know how I know your gay..."". And then every reason in the book. The outtakes are funny too!Don't miss this one!"
1,Don't even bother renting it,"Despite its high critical reviews and popularity at the box office, this movie is rather poor, in both taste and content.. It is unfunny, unintelligent and rife with ridiculous cliches and stereotypes. I have not witnessed such a gross display since ""Something About Mary.""In my opinion, the movie would have been more effective if it had made the point that the problem resides not with people like Andy, but with people like his asinine ""friends"" who can't accept him for what he is. Why should a person's private sexual life (or lack thereof) matter to anyone, except to those who are so insecure with their own sexuality that they need to mock others.' (""My d--- is your d---"" Please!)"
1,Juvenile - not worth the time or money,"I couldn't bring myself to finish this inane, vulgar, and ridiculous story. Mr Carrel should save his talents for The Office. This type of humor is beneath him."
3,NUDITY!,"Not enought T & A? This film was inferior to most of this genre: ""Van Wilder"" was more entertaining. Yet having seen ""Wedding Crashers"", this film is superior to such crap as that. Steve Carell is mediocre. The scenes are stolen within this film by the supporting cast. An entertaining film. Funny and shouldn't be watched alone."
4,Another excellent Leather offering,Stephen Leather continues to write with authority and has the abilty to increase the tension in his story line.I enjoyed it very much.
3,Has two problems.,"(1) The speaker is located under the handset and since the handset must be in place for speaker function to work it muffles the speaker. While you can hear fairly well, the person you are talking to can't.(2) The volume control works fine for the speaker phone but doesn't work for the handset."
2,Jwin JT-P590BLK Speaker Phone,The phone and speaker phone work fine. My only complaint is that the Caller ID does not work. It logs whom you have called. But does not tell you whom is calling.
1,You get what you pay for,"It seemed to good to be true, and it was. Hard to set up, not intuitive, cheaply made. I returned it to Amazon and bought the AT&T 950 which has similar features (no big buttons). It worked without a problem!"
2,Unbiased Review,"Ok, so i'm only reading this book because my GF is a fan of Fallaci.My review will be unbiased because, not being a fan of Fallaci, i am not going to exagerate any good points of the storyi've only read the beginning of this book but i think i have a good idea what the rest will be like.First, i think it is a good idea. Writing a letter to your unborn child. Sounds sweet, right?Well within the first few pages Fallaci seems to make very judgemental statements and does a good job of stating her opinions as facts (which is NOT a good thing!!)I gotta say, the writing style is nothing elegant, nothing special, nothing worth mentioning (positively).What i did notice, though, is that reading this book is almost as painful as reading ""force of reason"" or ""rage and pride""I wonder if she also trashes islam in this one?I am not going to keep reading to find out.."
4,Heart warming ending,Zack bought a big green egg at a flea market. The seller of the egg said it was the dinosaur egg and never put it in microwave. But new their housekeeper puts it in a microwave. What had happened on the egg? Did it become a big boiled egg?The story doesn't have reality as usual. And it makes the story funny and interesting for readers. But the last part of the story will warm your heart. You may think about saving nature and animals.
1,Should be recalled!,"Very disappointed in this toy & I can't believe it has not been recalled. No storage, the handle bars don't actually turn the wheels, very very small! My 11 month old son got this for a Christmas present. He can't sit on it and push with his feet without running them over. He has hurt himself badly on it when trying to push it from behind. Huge cut on his foot & smashed his hand in the racks that come off way too easily. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone, any age!!!"
3,riden on sit & scoot,It was a little smaller than I thought it would be. My grandson did not give it a second look. I wasexpecting him to love it but he did not even play with it. Maybe the wrong color I dont know. Waspacked well and came in record time. Thanks
3,Good for sounds.,"This toy is a hit because of the different sounds that it can make, but it is hard for my sons to maneuver around because there isn't much room to move their legs between the front and back wheels.Other than that, my boys really enjoy this toy."
4,Great toy for a little one!,"This is a great little ride-on toy! It makes tractor noises and my son loves the songs. The recommended age is too old..this toy is perfect for a child 20 months to about 3 years of age. It sits fairly low to the ground, so children with long legs would have a difficult time pushing. Perfect for a toddler. It is pricey. I would recommend the Lil'Quad Power-Wheels toy over this one for fun and the Lil'Quad only costs about $20 more."
3,The body is too wide...,Other reviewers are right in that it's size is more for a younger child except the body is so wide that it's hard for them to straddle plus move their little legs. The buttons and sounds are great.
2,non-functional,"This is a wonderful toy if you like your kid getting frustraited. The fenders stick out to the point where a child cannont move his/her legs forwards and backwards more than an inch or two. Now don't get me wrong, I am a john Deere man but this toy needs to be recalled and fixed so kids can enjoy RIDING it. They just can't get it to move. My kid loves the sounds and the key but it will not move more than a couple inches when he tries to ride it."
5,John Deere ATV - Ride-On,"I purchased this toy for my neice and she loves it. This is a self-propelled ride-on toy so it requires movement and encourages exercise. She especially loves the song that it plays as well as the beeps and lights. Overall, a great outside toy for a boy or girl."
5,At last this is it !,"Static contraction training is a god send and is a must for everyone who is interested in gaining strength and muscle size quickly and legally. At first I did not beleive what Sisco and Little had to say but intuition told me it was correct. When you first start the workouts you are actually stronger than you think you are and you feel that you must do more sets....DONT, just follow what the authors say and you will make gains. This is a very well written and informative book and the people who gave it less than four stars are entitled to their oppinions but must be doing something wrong.... Keep up the good work Mr Sisco and Mr Little."
5,AT FIRST DOUBTFUL BUT THEN IN AWE WITH RESULTS,At first I was doubtful. I got this book as a gift and then read through it and doubted it would work and then went on with my regular non-working program. After much frustration I said what the heck and tried static contraction training. Even though I added 1 or 2 more sets than recommended I am making great progress. It sounds crazy to work out only once a week but it sure did work for me. If you buy this book and try the program you will blow up with muscle mass. A MUST BUY!@
2,Not recommended,"I have been involved with competitive bodybuilding and power lifting for over 15 years. I was looking for something different / new and I thought this would be it. Well... not really. My ""holding"" strength went way up but the full range of movement strength really didn't budge at all. I followed the plan to the letter and it just didn't have the impact I was hoping for. If you want to get big, train 3 days per week for no more than 90 mins per workout. Train with basic movements for the first 6 months then add to it as you progress. Maximum days of training should only be 4 per week... any more than that and you are just tearing yourself down! And remember, YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT!"
4,astonished!,Static contraction lifting is the future of weight lifting. I thought I would never reach my goals until I read this book. I gave the book four stars instead five because of the many gross pictures of professional weight lifters in it. Because stactic lifting doesn't take much of your time and the only gains you make are tremendous. Right now I am currently playing rugby for a professional team. And thanks to this book I am one of the bigger guys on the pitch.
2,Range of Motion?,"The one big question I have is if you are doing a very limited range of motion with each exercise. Doesn't that limit how useful the muscle really is. If you can bench 250 using this method, how much weight can you really lift doing a bench press using full motion? It seems to me this may add weight to you exercises and muscle mass, all for looks but if you an athlete who needs to be strong during a full range of movement I don't think this will work for you. Unless I have misunderstood the method."
3,I saw the video,"I saw this method demonstrated on a Tony Robbins video. It sounded great but I have just two observations: These guys were literally using well over a thousand pounds of weight in some exercises. In one exercise, they had 3 guys sitting on top of the machine adding additional weight. It seems to me this is pushing the equipment past its limits. Is it safe to be using this much weight? Secondly, I've been working out for years and there is only so much 45lb plates to go around in any workout area. Everyone would have to take a break from their routines just so I could borrow the available weights for my workouts. Seems like a burden on everyone else around me."
1,Dont waste your money,This book may the single worst book I have ever read dealing with exercise. Sisco and Little's reseach is flawed and they exibit a lack of even the faintest grasp of exercise physiology or bio-mechanics.If I could give this book a negative star I would.
1,Followed faithfully-- LIKE A MORON!!!,"This books is extremely well written- like a LONG salesletter to get you to buy into the philosophy- and it's all UNTRUE.The book is SOO long, and the workout takes up ONE page of information. ONE PAGE.Really.ONE PAGE.The rest is ALL hype and lies.I followed this stuff for YEARS- listen to me- YEARS, and was assuming I was getting better, since my ""holds"" were.Then I realized that I HADN'T!!!!NOT AT ALL.I looked the same (which, I'll be honest, was all I was trying to change), and my full-range wasn't any better.PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!P.S.- Yeah, on Tony Robbins, the authors are interviewed, and there is NO WAY they are what I wanna look like! Fat, barely breathing right,... LIAR."
5,Nice!,"I tried this system for 6 weeks, using only a power rack at home (improvising for leg presses with squats, etc.) and I made progress every single time. It's weird not being sore after, but I did get stronger (in my full range too). I definitely recommend this book if only for the nutrition, rest, etc. info"
3,a question we are not asking?,"A big issue that comes from my reading of all the reviews is whether this system builds strength in the full range of motion. So, has anyone tried adapting the SC philosophy to full range movement? That is, do a ""set"" such that you do a full range motion rep and then ""fail"" at the second (or third) full range motion rep?In your next workout, after sufficient time off (what Sisco and Little say about rest seems to make sense), you go back and start with a somewhat higher weight. Presumably should be able to get one full range motion rep out of it and achieve muscle failure on the second or third full range motion rep. And the next time you use a higher weight, and so on and so on?Just wondering. This is not a rhetorical or smart*ss question. I may be missing something, so let me know your thoughts. Thanks."
3,JUDGE BY RESULTS PEOPLE!!!,"Results are the greatest way to judge the effectiveness of ANY training style...and with all due respect to the authors are these 2 guys in the best shape possible when you look at them- have you seen them? i mean one guy is somewhat thin and looks relatively healthy- though he resembles NOTHING near to a fit body builder, and the other guy looks likes a fat tub o lard!! (with all due respect sir). Seriously, I just can't give much credibility to a supposive fitness author/expert who looks more like a role model for a Krispy Kreme ad. Lose some weight buddy, then try and promote your ideas- walk your talk Mr. Little (your last name should be 'Huge'), b/c if I were to buy this book, and end up looking as chubby and larded/out of shape as you I would feel cheated and betrayed!!"
4,Great Grain Mill,"We use this mill to grind wheat berries, and this mill is working great for us. You need to make sure that the motor / lid is snapped down completely, or flour will shoot out the sides. The flour is finer than with our former mill. This Blentec 52-601-FLP makes the bread softer and the loaves rise more than we were used to. Sometimes air pockets form within the loaves, and we are adjusting the recipe to correct for this condition. This mill is smaller than we have had before, so we are grinding smaller amounts for frequently."
3,Gets the job done,"Mill effectively grinds food, fairly quickly, is basic and easy to set up and take apart.However, materials are such that it cracks or breaks easily, as evidenced by the fact that the motor housing was broken when it arrived -- alright if you don't move much, but doesn't fit our lifestyle. The mill is very noisy. The mill tends to be very messy to clean up once you are done with a grinding job -- there is no easy way to contain the dust. We opted for the Nutrimill and are much happier even though it is more expensive -- it is quieter, compact, better materials, and not nearly as messy (but a little more complex to set up at first)."
4,"Nice mill, just a little loud","This mill provides great mill speed combined with a fine grind, adjustable to a medium coarse grind. It is not suitable for cracked wheat grinding, only for flours."
3,"Works great. Slow, messy, noisy though.","I make at least one loaf of bread per week using wheat berries that I grind in this mill. It works to make good flour. But it can through dust everywhere. It's so noisy, you must wear ear protection. And it takes several minutes to process 14oz (2.5 cups) of hard berries. I'd like to give it a higher rating, but I don't have anything else to compare. It's faster than a hand mill, that's for sure. Compared to a food processor, it's much slower. As long at it lasts for the long term, I think it's a good buy. The bread is wonderful!"
5,Amazing,"This is a really good book, one of the best i have ever get, a really nice and easy engine with a great and encapsulated code.A neat use of pixel and vertex shaders wich is one of the evaded threads in another books, besides, this book is for DirectX (thank God)"
1,Pompous.,"Beware purchasing this book. It's written in such a way that only makes sense if you wrote it, particularly the code (a maze of jargon completely lacking in any clear explaination). And believe me, sticking with it until you can understand it does NOT help. Not only are the methods overly-complicated, they are also piss-poor in terms of performance and flexibility. Three months later, and I'm still angry I bought this book."
2,Thought it was about Level of Detail,"Turns out it's only about removing vertices at a certain distance! Not good! All the demos are the same! From 6-13! Really, it is!"
2,grinding code,"Ive been grinding thru his source code for more than a month and am getting tired. Havent even got the first example to work yet in VS2005. compilation errors in the source code, and it is poorly documented. No (very few) function header comments to explain the passed in arguments. Also needs more overall class level comments, even though the classes are relatively small.If you have enough time to study his code maybe it would payoff. But he explains a concept or two in the book, then leaves you hanging with the entire complicated engine.He does have some good stuff in his code, here and there. Ive only been programming in direct X for several months, I think I am going to try to get another book."
3,"Interesting ideas, many faults.","This is a tough book to recommend. If you need your hand held through detailed examples, this is not a good source at all, especially since the sample programs are (1) overly complex and platform-dependent and (2) slow and ugly. On the other hand, this DOES discuss texturing, quadtrees, a few CLOD algorithms, sky and water rendering, Perlin noise, and a few other things as they relate to terrain, and can be a useful source of ideas for the not-quite-novice. Yes, most of the information here can be found on the web, but that's true of practically any programming book.By the way, a MAJOR annoyance here is the really rather astounding number of typos and basic usage errors (""discreet"" vs. ""discrete,"" etc) that somehow were not caught in editing. There seems be a trend to this effect in game programming books lately, but this one is really exceptionally error-ridden."
3,so-so book,The author did a good job of explaining the algorithms. Publisher should've paid for someone to read the book once before printing it. There were tons of spelling errors. This book isn't for people new to DirectX. It was worth $30.
2,Another dissapointment!,I purchased this headset for a family member on my calling plan. I wish there had been more pictures of the product available because afer I bought it I was terrible dissapointed with the quality of materials. It is made of very hard plastic with a rigid ear piece that is extremely difficult to put on quicky and is very uncomfortable. Call quality is mixed at best. I was embarrassed when they took it out of the box for a first look. My advice - buy your bluetooth headsets someplace you can actually see and touch them and be able to return them more easily.
5,Samsung WEP170 Bluetooth,I received a defective headset at first. I contacted the company and sent it in and they sent me a new one immediately. It works wonderfully and the staff was easy to work with.
2,It sucks,"The piece that goes around your ear is hard, uncomfortable, and difficult to get on and off, the ear piece its self is not loud enough, and I found that the sound fades in and out. I would not waste my money on this, I am taking mine back."
1,IT DID NOT WORK!!!,WELL WHEN I GOT THE ITEM IT WASN'T WORKING AND I HAD TO SEND IT BACK AND I HAVE YET TO GET A NEW ITEM TO REPLACE THE ONE I PAID FOR OR A REFUND TO PAY ME BACK FOR THE ITEM THAT I GOT THAT DID NOT WORK.
1,I stopped using it after two months.,"This is the first and only Bluetooth I purchased. The reception and microphone is good indoors and out. I could never get it to feel comfortable on my ear. The answer, on/off button is in a very awkward position. The ear piece kept loosing connection with my phone (Samsung A900) and it was depleting the phone battery very fast, so by the end of the day I had no battery left, even if I used the ear piece for only two hours a day. I stopped using it after two months."
2,"Strange sound quality, falls off ear.","I got this piece a while ago and it was a decent buy. I could have gotten a universal headpiece and paid close to the same price, I'd advise anyone to do the same.After a while, the wear caused the headpiece for the ear to stretch out of place and it constantly fell off my ear in the middle of a conversation. Very annoying. The sound also went in and out sometimes."
4,Great Tool,"Great tool does what it made for no problems at all to remove my radio. Money well spent as easy as 1,2,3 your done."
5,Great product and exceptionally priced.,Bought these as party favors for my son's birthday and ended up getting more for our football parties. They are not cheaply made and decal has not faded and we have had first set for over two years.
5,Great coffee table book...,I purchased this book after hearing the author on KROQ. I absolutely loved it. It was a combination of funny yet realistic situations. I've often asked myself some of the very same questions and could relate. I read some of the letters at a family gathering and we laughed out loud.
3,cracked more smiles than laughed out loud,I came across this book after looking at reviews for LETTERS TO EBAY which I LOVED by the way. One of the reviewers HATED the book and suggested this one. I could not wait to get into it. After reading letters to ebay first I couldn't help but compare the two eachother and on CONSUMER JOES end I was disapointed. It was humurous and I did laugh to myself. It also was a bit more believeable than LETTERS TO EBAY but it didn't have me laughing out loud in the middle of BORDERS as I had with said book and there was a lot of back and forth about very silly things that the author should have cut before because they were just down right stupid. In all I'm glad to own it and will reccomend it to a friend but I was expecting a little bit more.
5,A child's dinner tray holds an adventure of action,"Leo Landry writes and illustrates the very simple Eat Your Peas, Ivy Louse! which introduces readers to the world's smallest circus starring the Tender Tiny Peas. A child's dinner tray holds an adventure of action - which doesn't involve consumption, unfortunately, in this easy reader."
4,I like the absence of narrators and historical photos. It's all sceneries and music.,Some of the still scenes last too long. There are too many close-ups such as a stone in a streams or a cluster of pine leaves.
2,Lame,"I lived up in the California Redwoods for 8 years and spent most of my off time hiking up the various trails in the National and State parks in Northern California. This DVD doesn't begin to do justice to this beautiful area. For one thing it looks like this was filmed in the late winter; the worst time to appreciate this area. Also, they omitted the most beautiful spots. This is a place where mountains covered with massive trees come right up to the ocean. Where you can stand on cliffs almost 1000 feet high and look down on the Blue Pacific. Where crystal clear wild rivers that scare the heck out of all but the most courageous whitewater kayakers tear past these majestic giants. If I had the equipment I'd go up there and make a much better DVD than they did. I say start over and hire some local folks in Del Norte and Humbolt Counties to show you where to film."
3,looks faded out,"sorry had to ogive 3 stars because most of the scenes looked faded out in spite of high definition. i expected lush green settings with vivid colors, but except for a few shots most of scenes were bland.their other bluray ""fall in new england"" is 1000 times better looking for the same price."
5,Love my camera-,"This camera is great!!! It is just like my old camera, I have been trying to find a camera with a big zoom and manual capabilities that I could actually afford. There are lots of things I haven't figured out yet, but so far it is easy to use and the pictures are looking good."
3,"great features, poor lens","This camera has a lot of really great features for the price, but the lens is so below standard that it is shocking. My little 3MP point-and-shoot Camedia has a far superior lens and produces much clearer photos. I've tested them side by side, and it is really no contest. Also, I find that autofocus doesn't do well in very closeup situations, and that the manual focus is very difficult to use. Maybe I got a defective camera? Given the other reviews, I am beginning to wonder about that. Regarding value for money in terms of features, I would give this five stars, but for the lens, only one; therefore I've averaged it at 3 stars."
4,A great Camera,"When all things are considered, this is a great camera for the anyone not needing to blow pic,s out larger than 10x12, the manual with this product is much better than with most over sea,s Manuals. shutter response can be improved by reading the manual and using the camera as it was designed, it is not the last answer to everyone with only 6.3 mgd pixils,just shoot at max dpi,with a 1gd card and recharge the batts, and you will learn to love it.as a update to this review I have learned that the camera works best,using the ""P"" setting and keeping the IOS setting at 400 or below the auto setting pick,s too high a IOS and the pic,s come out grainy or spotty."
5,Fuji Finepix S6000fd,"While not an SLR, the quality and versatility of this camera is simply amazing for the price! Picture quality is stunning!"
3,beware 'Program AE' mode does not work,"I purchased this camera from Amazon recently. About three weeks after I received it, I discovered the 'Program AE' mode did not work. When I set the Mode dial to 'P', the yellow up/down symbols do NOT appear on screen (on the EVF or LCD screen) to indicate you can change the settings (Owner's Manual page 62). I contacted Fujifilm and the tech had me do a 'Reset' but that didn't fix the problem. He advised me to send it in for repair. I'm not sure about sending it in for repair which may introduce other problems. I thought I warn others about this defect. Camera is made in China. Good luck."
3,The basic hypothesis of this book- the problem of disconnect,"The first edition of this book was published in 1994 but 'Techno Vision II' has been fully updated to incorporate the revolution impact of the Internet. The basic hypothesis of the book is the problem of disconnect. In most organisations, there is a fundamental disconnect between 'techies' and the rest of corporate management - a mismatch that is caused by disparities in training and temperament. Disconnect is so ingrained that few recognize it, despite it being one of most profound limitations to achieving improvements in productivity and competitiveness. The book examines in considerable detail the causes of disconnect and possible solutions. Bridging the gap between 'techies' and the rest of the corporate hiearchy is critical to the future of many organisations."
3,useful summary of current IT topics for CEOs,"Wang tells of how CIOs and CEOs suffer from a communication disconnect, and ways to connect. He also introduces the reader to several current IT topics. I found parts of the book a thinly-veiled marketing tool for Computer Associates, the author's company. He also mis-formats URLs."
5,Good book to understand deeply behaviour,"This book is excellent. We will understand deeply how the consumer/patient acts to respond the fact. A lot of theories present in the book and it is applicable.I highly recommend this book to the readers.Regards,Thanh Nguyen, Vietnam"
3,A Great CBS Animated Special From 1971,"This Treasure Island is the animated special that aired on CBS in the early 70's at Thanksgiving time. It's created by Air Programs International (API), and was part of the ""Famous Classic Tales"" series.If you grew up during the 70's you probably remember these specials. Treasure Island was one of the best of them. It's well voiced--with Australian actor Ron Haddrick as Long John Silver. Distinctive API animation and nice music too. Certainly worth having, if you remember it.The show has been available on VHS from time to time, but this is the first time it has been on DVD. Unfortunately the quality of the DVD is not so good. I'd give it four stars if the DVD quality was a little better."
5,Good Book,"The perfect book for both new & experienced amateur woodworkers wanting to make practical & stylish pieces for their home.This book has over 25 original designs, including a traditional style console table, modern kitchen makeover, Gotic style bathroom cabinet & simple but stylish bed.Each project has clear, step by step photographs & straightforward diagrams. Interesting discussion on how to use hardwood, softwood & manmade boards to the best effect. Plus tools, lumber & techniques - all the information & advice you'll need."
5,Excellent!!!,Never since the H-Puperino website have I ever seen a Java book this good and easy to understand! I love this book! It is my mentor.
2,Serious flaws hamper otherwise good book ....,"Holzner does a good job of helping beginning java programmers learn to code some little applets. HOWEVER, the Java 1.2 examples in the book do not work! If the author (and/or editors) would have taken the time to test them with the JDK 1.2 , they would have discovered this. Obviously they did not.These examples were written for a previous version of Java and simply not updated. Another example of slapping a Java 2 title onto an old Java 1.1 book.This present a critical obstacle to the newbie who will not know how to alter the programs to get them running. This flaw is serious enough for me to disuade anyone from purchasing this book unless they have a Java expert handy to guide them through the correction process.Very sloppy job of editing, guys!"
1,A book for beginners,This book is just suited for beginners and really does'nt cover any advanced topics. The code samples are very narrow and cannot be reused extensively. The CD does not contain JDK1.2
1,"THE CD DOESN'T WORK!Great for bigginers, But low on details.","THE CD DOESN'T WORK. I continuasly experienced 'File Not Found' errors. Never before have I had this kind of problem with a CD included with a book. I e-mailed the author and publisher; but they never got back to me. I did keep the book because I was pleased with the easy-to-follow examples and head on approach. I am a beginer with Java and the book was a good start. I was dissapointed with the lack of indepth explanations of the lines of code, and as stated before, I was really upset with the lack of publisher support and CD. BOTTOM LINE: SAVE YOUR MONEY. YOU CAN DO BETTER!"
1,TERRIBLE!!!,"I made the mistake of picking up this book to quickly learn to use the AWT. The book doesn't really teach you anything aside from providing code for narrowly designed applets. If you are interested in examples, you can probably do better with the ""Java Examples"" book by O'Reilly."
2,"Interesting voices, Oversweet arrangements","This is Arabia from Egypt Eastwards, not including North Africa to the West.No Morocco, Algeria etc.Most of the tracks are modern Lebanon-Syrian cafe style with strings or synth strings.Not my cup of tea. The voices are interesting but the arrangements are sweet like baklava.I wanted more authentic ethnic, guess I should have read the liner notes, not just 1 review.The last 2 tracks are pre 1970 and interesting, especially the Oum Kaltoum: sounds like a recording of a scratchy 78. The Fairuz track is from 1961 I think, and shows some fire, but I can't love the arrangement.Maybe there is a complete, good quality CD of Oum Kaltoum out there which could replace this on my shelf...."
3,Paddling Hawaii - A little too basic.,"Once this book got to ACTUAL paddling locations, it was quite good. However, almost half of the book was spent on kayaking basics which, I would venture to guess, most of those purchasing this book already are familiar with."
4,Mitzvah mobile,"This book, printed in Israel, earns four stars, as does the bright red racing-car that doubles as a do-good-deed engine, driving the five-year-old main character Avi to perform one good turn after another.His car, painted # 613 on the hood (for the number of Mitzvot, or good deeds, commanded of the Jewish people), takes him to say prayers (Tefillah), give charity (Tzedakah), help an old lady across the street, give coins to a poor man, clean spilled milk, learn the Hebrew alphabet (Aleph Bet) and visit the sick.The bright enticing illustrations draw young readers in, especially boys who happen to like cars.The rhymed story seems a bit stilted, but kids don't mind. After all, the Mitzvah mobile is red. This book provides a good way to start tots on the road to Jewish values.--- Alyssa A. Lappen"
4,cute little costume boots,Bought these for my son to wear to a renaissance wedding. Pleased with how they look especially when you consider the price.
3,Decent slipper but NO arch support,"I was looking for slippers with arch support because I really need support and that's why I picked these. The description clearly states that these slippers have arch supports, and the sole even makes them look like they do, but they do not... the foot bed is perfectly flat. If you don't care about the arch supports these seem like decent slippers. I sent mine back."
4,Functional,"Everything came just as it should. No complaints. I'll use these boots once, maybe twice in a year, so for what they will be used for I'm happy."
2,these will not last long,"very lightweight and flimsey, if you only need them for a one time thing they will work. but dont expect much."
3,"not ""real"" boots","not sure why other reviews are saying ""great for cold weather"". i bought this for my outfit for the renaissance fairs and they are not ""real"" boots. they are the thin material halloween costumes are made of. if you're looking for actual cold weather boots do not buy these. also my boots arrived with 2 little boxes of children's toothpaste? not sure why but thanks i guess."
1,Not what anyone would expect.,"This is not what one would expect. The product is bad in quality, the metal links feel awkward.... Lessons learn, never get a watch online..."
2,Its ok but naa.,This is an ok watch but I have had to change the battery twice in less then a year. Maybe I got a lemon. Still it was not as interesting as I expected it to be.
4,Rst and Be Thankful,"""Rest and Be Thankful"" is the name given to a green island, sheltering between the forks of Crazy Creek, high in the Wyoming hills. Here, in pioneer days wagon trains coming over the Stoneyway Trail halted before they continued westward.Two friends, Mrs. Peel and Sarah Bly wandered off the State Highway which they were following to California. Their background was the salons and culture of France, not the wild west. Having found this wonderful place they wanted to share it with their circle of literary hopefuls and authors, which they invited to come.The charm and humor of this story lies in the varied reactions and interactions of these Easterners as they confront the magnificence of the scenic grandeur they encounter, along with the simple genial frankness of its occupants, the owners and cowboys of Flying Tail Ranch. We are dealing with humorous colliding cultures here."
4,Old-fashioned romantic novel set in Wyoming a generation ago.,"This is a good old-fashioned western-style novel set in the Grand Tetons area of Wyoming a generation ago, with a plot developed around the conflict between plain Western cowboys and urban ""sophisticates"" from the New York City art world. There's adventure, romance, and fine character development. The author has an excellent writing style. It's an excellent read."
1,poorly organized,"I'll preface this brief review by saying that I have not read the entire bok. However, this is impossible since the book is filled with many black ""dos boxes"" which are illegible due to the faintness of the print. These are meant to demonstrate user input, but besides being impossible to read, waste a lot of space.The installation chapters were not very helpful, and poorly organized...."
2,"Hardly a ""bible""","I purchased this book with great anticipation of expanding my knowledge of mySQL and making great us of the section on perl. Overall, I'm very dissapointed. The book itself goes into great detail about certain things that need not such a vast description, yet only privide single examples for some important things.The CD-ROM is useless. I was expacting it to have code from the book, whereas it's a collection of mySQL apps and programs that you can get free elswhere.Having explored the perl chapter of the book in greatest detail, it provides inadequite examples with a lot of inneficient coding.I give the book credit, however, for covering as much ground as it does, mySQL with perl, PHP and ODBC. Overall, however, not worth the money."
2,Not worth the money,"I hate to admit that I was suckered into buying this book. I was looking for a decent book to help we with the administration of MySQL. Unfortunately this book only slowed me down by providing samples that were unclear and in some cases just wrong. In the end I waded through the documentation for MySQL on the web and found the correct answers that just were not present in the book.Just to give some examples of things that were wrong: the binary distribution summaries are not accurate as described on page 57. The syntax for changing the root password was also wrong on page 62. These are critical things to have wrong in a book called a ""Bible""."
2,"Some good info, but ...","Unfortunately, time and development have passed this book by. It is for MySQL 4.0, which has been FAR surpassed by the newer 5.0 version.As mentioned by some other reviewers, one of the main problems with the book is the illustrations. They are so dark as to be illegible. Not sure what the people that got the press proofs were thinking when they let that out the door.The author does a reasonable job on certain areas (hey, can't be all bad if he has a dedication to Eddie Van Halen).Might want to try the third edition of MySQL by Paul DuBois as a good reference book that is much more up-to-date."
2,False advertising,Don't waste your money on this. The book and reviews claim to include binaries and source of MySQL database but the CD-ROM contains neither. Bogus.
2,Too expensive for what you get,"""Sensual Massage for Pregnancy"" presents a clear and detailed explanation of what a perineal massage should be like in order to achieve the goal of keeping an intact perinee after delivery. However, this part is short and what the DVD also includes regarding sexual intercourse during pregnancy, body changes and other interesting topics are not interesting to watch AT ALL since it is only the protagonist of the video talking to the camera in a monotonous tone when they could have had pictures or animated sequences to ilustrate the information she is giving, that's the whole idea of buying a DVD, if not you can attend a lecture or download a podcast about the subject."
