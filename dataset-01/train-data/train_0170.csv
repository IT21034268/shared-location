5,OUTSIDE INTRUDER,"THIS MOVIE HAD THE WRONG TITLE THIS MOVIE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH GOING TO A BALL, STILL CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY IT WAS CALLED MONSTER'S BALL, IF ANY THING THE MOVIE SHOWED HOW PEOPLE STILL HATE ON YOU BECAUSE OF THE COLOR OF YOUR SKIN, EVEN HATE ON CHILDREN BECAUSE OF THE COLOR OF THIER SKIN, FORTUNATELY EVERY BODY DON'T FEEL THE SAME BUT WHAT THE MOVIE DID SHOW IS THE PEOPLE WHO WOULD TREAT BLACK PEOPLE LIKE HUMAN BEINGS, BECOMES A TARGET THEY BECOME THE FOCUS OF ATTENTION WITHIN THIER OWN RACE."
2,Never got to finish it,"I'm sure this was a great movie, but it kept freezing and getting stuck after the 6th or 7th time of restarting it I gave up and never got to finish it."
1,"Sorry, this suspension of reality is too much","This flick depicts the worst stereotypes about the south and sorry, I didn't buy Billy Bob Thornton as a man ANY woman would get involved with for any reason. Halle Berry's Oscar seems more for her entire body of work than this flick, which she was wasted on. There is nothing to like about this movie, even if you like grim, in which case rent ""Psycho"" instead, which is what the Academy did when it wasted awards on it"
1,Halle Berry 's ocsar winning performance PLEASE!!!!,This was a horrible movie. The plot was simplitic at best.It was going all over the place. None of it made sense. Halle Berry is a one note actress at best. Is it just me or does she play the same part in every movie. She needs to stick to playing crack heads like she did in some of her earlier movies and then at least you see some dimension in her performance. I have talked to atleast twenty people who have seen this movie and did not understand it. Whoever directed this fluff should have lemon juice squeezed in his eye. I am not hating on the sex scene in this movie... After all that's what she got the oscar for.
1,Pure raunch - not worth a single star,"Halle Berry has mortgaged her dignity and probably her career in this should be X-rated loser-fest. Billy Bob Thornton also continues to spiral downhill with his poor choice of starring roles. If your want to see Halle Berry, ... then check it out. Otherwise dump it."
1,"Awful, Awful, Awful","Quite possibly the most tedious film I have seen, I am utterly mystified by the hype surrounding it. The acting is wooden and not believable - both Thornton and Berry have done far better in other roles - and the story, while professing to be a gritty and realistic drama, is more like a cynical attempt to introduce sensitive issues such as race and the death penalty in order to make the film seem like a social commentary rather than a shallow and boring look at 2 unbelievable and hypocritical characters. Simply put, save your money"
1,Rent Something Else! Not worth the money,"While this movie does address real issues, and I'm sure that some of the things that happen to the characters in this movie could happen in real life, this movie is defiantely over rated. I don't see how the critics see this as a great film. If you ask me it was more about sex and abuse (in many forms) than it was anything else. If I could, I wouldn't even give this movie one star. It was more of a x-rated flick than it was a drama."
2,What was all the fuss about????!!!!,"Halle Berry - I've seen her do better. Billy Bob - hasn't been the same since ""Sling Blade."" The premise was good but the movie's pace was waaay too slow. Another reviewer hit it on the head: being a racist doesn't go away in one night as it did with the Billy Bob character. Had high hopes for this movie, but was disappointed."
2,Good Chemistry so-so Film,finally saw this film to see what all the Hype was all about.The Characters for Me didn't really show enough overall feeling for me.Halle Berry while I Acknowledge Her Role I don't see what all the Hype was all about.The Intimacy Aspect seems to be the only thing that makes it as Big of a Deal to me overall.but the film takes on so many things without doing any one any justice to me.alot of things thrown around without any solutions.Halle&Billy Bob have Better Chemistry than a Film.
3,"Expected a nail-biting ending, but was let down","I thought the storyline was very great throughout the whole movie. Once the worst happens to Thorton's son, and later Thorton and Berry move in down the line, I knew that she would find some type of evidence from the son's personal possessions to change the whole mood of her and Thorton. Well, once she finds out, a quick thought of shock, disbelief, etc., but the better overcomes her bad thoughts=the end. Where's the strong suspenseful ending?"
2,Extremely overrated,"Tragic and dramatic in that ""beat the viewer over the head"" way. About as subtle as Kelsey Grammer is these days. Thornton does a better job than Berry - but sadly, I am not always sure that he is acting in this one. Berry has one fine scene in a truck, but when you can catch a 60 sec. sequence and say:""oh, she was really good there,"" that's not Oscar worthy. BTW: The sex scene really does not deserve the attention it received. Rent only."
2,overrated,"Fans of Billy Bob will enjoy this movie, and people will probably buy it for Halle Berry's Academy Award-winning performance. The steamy bedroom scenes will attract some viewers. All in all, the movie has a slightly manic quality. Halle Berry plays the role of convict's wife and bereaved mother without much gradation, and comes across as slightly hysterical throughout. (Her acceptance speech at the Awards seemed a continuation of this ""take"".) Billy Bob plays a phlegmatic, decent man who has his own memory-demons to conquer. The movie is diverting but fails to satisfy."
2,Highly Disappointed,I thought the movie was going to be something fantastic since Halle had won an award for it. But it was a big disappointment and the sex scene that I had heard so much about was not great. Everyone in the movie in my opinion did poor acting. And the ending was ......... there are not enough words to describe what a disappointment this movie was!
1,halle is awful and loose,man this movie could have rocked but halle kinda ruined it for me .i mean she is a horrible actor and her false preformance combinded with her loose desision to get nude gave off a sour aroma to the whole film. she deserved the oscar but certainitly not for this movie. Do not buy this is all you want is to see halle because her preformance doesnt live up to anything. Absolutly awful.
1,Monster Disaster,"This movie is awful. It's about a racist white man who becomes open-minded after knocking boots with a crazy Black woman. How inspiring. Halle Berry- the most overrated Black actress in history- wins an Oscar for her role as Leticia. Whoop-dee do. Then she dedicates the Oscar to Dorothy Dandridge. I'm sure Dorothy turned in her grave when she heard that. Any self-respecting woman in her right mind would have never done what Halle Berry did. But who needs respect when you have tons of money, right? Anyway, this movie is awful and is probably enjoyable to those who reminisce about the good ole days when black women were sexually exploited against their will by white men. I'm sure Adrien Brody enjoyed it because he had to get a piece of the action when he kissed Halle Berry on stage. Halle Berry should be ashamed."
5,something to make you feel alive,"OK. So I don't really know the harsh realities of southern America. What I could see in Monster's Ball is two people in desperate need of relief from their miserable lives. Billy Bob and Halle Berry are both astounding. I heard people say she didn't deserve the Oscar so I really wanted to see the movie. Don't believe a word of that! She is simply great, very different from all her other roles. She has a special vulnerability and sadness in her eyes that would touch the coldest of hearts. And the crying scenes are extrmeely intense. OK, so the sex scenes were a bit long given the circumstances, but I totally cope with the idea of removing pain with anti-pain, which is pleasure. Actually there's a book (I honestly don't remember the title) where the main character says ""I need to have sex or I'll start cuttin' myself, to take the pain off my mind"". And Halle Berry's line reminded me of that phrase. So just watch the movie and leave politics behind."
3,"Okay movie, great acting","Okay the story behind this movie is actually not very good. Halle Berry plays the wife of an inmate on deathrow, when her husband is executed she turns and finds love in the arms of, ironically, a very racist white man played by Billy Bob Thornton. To add to the irony Hank (thornton) is the man who executed Leticia's (berry) husband. Although I have to admit the acting is incredible, Berry definatley deserved the award for best actress and I think Thornton could have won be his votes were split between this movie and The man who wasnt there, plus an mediocre performance in Bandits. There is very raw emotion plus a very raw love scene. This movie just makes you think."
2,Too violent for my eyes...,"I only got through about a third of this movie and then I had to turn it off. Way too violent. Objectively the acting is good, if it affected me this much. But I can't watch a half hour of intense child abuse and racism and other [stuff] without feeling queasy. Halle Berry and Billy Bob Thornton must have been good in it, because I absolutely *hated* both of them after the first 20 minutes of the movie and didn't care what happened to them. OR maybe they were good actors but the plot was too intense. I found out later that something terrible happens to Halle Berry and is supposed to make you feel sympathy for her, but I never felt any. The two of them are a couple of monsters and deserve every bit of their misery. So, you decide...if you have a strong, strong stomach and can get through the first half of the movie, then stick with it. Otherwise, do like me and go rent a disney movie instead. I get enough [stuff] every night from the evening news."
1,I didn't like this film,Producers in this film attempt to answer for western societies increasing growth of interacial marriages and dating. Airy music fits the seen for this movie well because the script is way out there. I had a really hard time understanding the plot. Most annoying was the music which played almost more then intellectual script. Sean Puffy Combs plays the black guy who is in jail for what ever reason I never caught. Billy Bob Thorton plays a racist who has taste for the wife of a guy he helped execute. Film shows a bird flying the coup when this interacial couple gets intimate. Producers were genius because they were able to give audience a bad taste in their mouths and an airy space in their heads after watching this film.
2,I hated this movie.,"I wouldn't recommend it to anyone I like. It got me very depressed at the end. I hate the plot , the story and everything!"
1,monster's ball... who knew?,"This movie above all was really poorly made. It has real family issues and a heavy porno flick all rolled into one. If your up for a decent movie look somewhere else, looking for sex in movies, then this movie is for you.The title almost had nothing to do with the movie. There was no monsters or a ball I could find throughout the entire time."
3,Overrated,"An interesting story, and decently acted but it doesn't quite deliver. Hallie Berry goes semi-nude in her big love scene, but did little else that might justify her academy award for best actress; unless it was pretending love for Billy Bob Thornton.Of far more interest than this movie is the sycophancy that inevitably attends ""provocative, interracial themes"". The media's obsession with forcing this issue borders on the pathological. I was duped into thinking this movie might be something different, but it's not. It's OK, just don't believe all the hype."
2,didn't deserve the hype,This movie was extremely overhyped!Yes blacks have been discriminated against in the past and there are alot of worthy black actors and actresses who have been unjustly overlooked for past academy awards.However by giving the best actress award to Halle Berry I can only come to the conclusion that she recieved this award because she's black!Denzel earned his on talent alone.Halle was given hers based on skin color and this is not the way to make up for past injustices.
2,Could have been great...,This film could have been great. The acting is flawless andthe story itself quite remarkable. The sex scenes are sointensely graphic that the pleasure of watching the film islost; in short watching such scenes makes one feel like aPeeping Tom!
4,Tragic but well acted.,"This film is dramatic, tragic, and all out depressing. But the acting is what steals the show. Halle Barry deserved the Oscar, and the film will be remembered. Not the best. If you are in the mood for happiness, skip this film."
2,Not What I Expected,"Ok, let me start with the fact that I felt let down a bit because of all the hype. And if Halle Berry deserved an oscar than so did Billy Bob Thorton.Billy Bob plays a racist, ... parent and prison guard who learned his ideals form his racist, ... father. He sees the light and runs into Halle and forms an attachment to her. The rest, so they say, is history. While Halle's performance is very good I feel that Billy Bob's was more of a progressive character study through changes and issues.And the ending left something unresolved (in my opinion). The hype was worth more than the movie. It drug a little but was a good character study if you could stand the pace."
4,This movie is better than I thought it would be.,"Billy Bob does an excellent job portraying a man who is re-awakened to the world due to some catastrophic events. Peter Boyle's performance was good as was Heath Ledger's as his son. Halle Berry's performance was admirable also, but not in my opinion Oscar-worthy. I could have done without Puff-Daddy, P-Diddy, Puff the Magic Music Thief, or whatever he calls himself these days even being in this film. At least his part is somewhat short.In short I rate this film as a decent flick about 2 people whose lives have spiraled out of control and find some solice and direction in each other's company."
4,allcanadianguy@shaw reviews * * * *,"Monster's Ball (2001)Who would like this? : romantic & psychological drama fansWorth seeing?...-buy it : yes-rent it : yesCast:Billy Bob ThorntonHalle BerryHeath LedgerPeter BoyleSean ""Puffy"" CombsMos Def___________________Marc ForsterDirector* Do not miss the performances from both Billy Bob Thornton andHalle Berry. The people who don't get into movies like this may have become dumb & numb from watching part 4 of their favorite action series too many times."
2,Monster's Drawl Y'all,"I found this film to be repulsive. I also find it hard to believe Halle Berry (The Flintstones, B.A.P.S) won an Oscar for this. Her performance was blaringly flawed, and her portrayal of a ""ghetto hootchie mama"" was exaggerated and offensive. The storyline in Monster's Ball is also redundant. How many movies do they have to make about prejudice in the south? We get the point! This movie was horrible."
3,Not all that,"A nice little film (terrific cinematography) but not of the heavyweight character many have ascribed to it. While I think she's improving as an actress and is singularly beautiful, Halle Berry did not deserve an Oscar for this performance. I thought she was overshadowed by Thornton, who can play this type of character in his sleep (and better watch out lest he start doing so . . .)"
3,Great acting...,"and for the most part a GREAT story. I have one MAJOR flaw...the porn scene between Thornton and Berry. We didn't need to see that. But overall, it was a great movie. Halle Berry did an outstanding job and Thornton did great as well."
2,I know what it tried to say,"This movie wanted to be so more than what it actually was. I love dramatic cinema but this movie was garbage.I didn't buy Halle in this movie and can't see what the she got the oscar for. The ""love"" seen was way over done and added nothing to the movie. I think that Halle Berry was way to pretty to play this part. I have a hard time understanding how a woman that looks like that would have no options except grungy old Billy Bob. Its just not going to happen that way.This movie wanted to be a statment that love can overcome anything including racism but the message I get from the movie is that racism can be put on hold as long as you get to hit the sheets with a woman that could possibly pose for playboy.Sorry but thats bullsh-t"
4,Worth Watching,"This film was well worth watching. After a very slow start, the story picked up steam and held my interest until the end. The key to liking this film is to be patient. The reason for watching this film is the story, not the presence of Heath Ledger or Billy Bob Thornton or Halle Berry. If you watch the film expecting some sort of variation on ""A Knight's Tale"" or ""Slingblade"" or ""Boomerang"", you will be disappointed. Do yourself a favor and forget about the other films that the actors have appeared in. Finally, this film could have been rated NC-17 for its realistic sex scenes. Keep that in mind when deciding whom to watch this film with."
4,Monster's Ball?,"I really appreciated this movie. I can understand why it won Halley Berry an Oscar. However, it could have stood on its own, without the steamy sex scene or Hank's (Thornton) oral sex scene. And from where did the title come?I loved the way the ending keeps you guessing. ""What will Letitia (Berry) do?"" one wonders. Will she confront Hank with her newly discovered information? Will she kill Hank and bury him in his son's grave that sits newly dug in the yard? Lonely and disillusioned, will she kill herself? Will their relationship survive? What's next for the two of them?This movie is a keeper. I will watch it again and again!"
2,even greater than catwoman!,"ooo! see halle act. act, halle, act. emote. emote. see halle act drunk. see halle act crying. see halle act nympho. act, halle, act. can someone explain to me how the senior prison guard on death row and a woman whos been visiting her husband there for 11 years never managed to see one another before he ordered chocolate ice cream with a plastic spoon? but what does it matter, since we get to see halle act? act, halle, act!"
3,Good Film though filled with Racist Stereotypes of black female sexuality,"In one of my university courses we had a discussion about black female sexuality in society. It seems like black women in pop culture are still depicted as either the mammy roles such as Queen Latifah in ""Bringing Down the House"" or the whore such as Halle Berry in ""Monster's Ball."" A lot of people say the explicit sex scene was necessary I disagree. I also believe the sex scene takes away from the film. It just didn't make sense.Angela Bassett turned down the role and she told Newsweek in an article in 2002 she didn't want to be in a movie that exploits black female sexuality. Look at the subliminal messages of this movie. So a black woman has to SLEEP with a white man JUST to win an Oscar. When is a black woman going to win an Oscar for merit. Whoopi Goldberg won an Oscar in 1990 she's the only other LIVING black woman to be an academy award winner I think that says a lot about Hollywood and a lot about American society."
3,Very Disturbing but not so Great!,"Billy Bob Torton is great (as usual), Peter Boyle is Spectacular, Heath Ledger is very good but although Berry was good she was not Oscar Worthy. Berry's performance consisted of crying jaggs and taking her clothes off as she cries hysterically over her son's death. Is this Oscar worthy?? No! I believe that Berry is a good actress that is growing in range but this performance did not stand out to me. Overall the movie was o.k, the acting was good and the story was also o.k.. If anybody should have been nominated for this movie it should have been B.B Thorton or Peter Boyle!!"
2,No Cinderella at this Ball,After hearing all the hype about this movie I really expected something Great. Boy was I wrong! Yes the performances were good but nothing Oscar worthy. Halle Barry's role could have been switched with Sissy Spacek's role in In the Bedroom and nobody would know a difference. Both feature grieving mothers with a lot of screaming and tantrums with no real payoff in the end. Nicole Kidman was the true Oscar worthy performance this year for not only having to act but also singing and dancing on top of it. Monster's Ball moves at a very slow pace and after about an hour I couldn't care less what happened to these characters. When I pay for a movie I go to be entertained and with this one I should have stayed home!
4,mr. deitz,case was in excellent shape. movie had small scratch at beginning which disrupted the film but was not terribly bad for the price.
1,TERRIBLE,"I should have known that this was a bad movie as soon as I saw who Halle's husband was portrayed by. I can only imagine that she won the award for the lovemaking scene. I thought that she portrayed Dorothy Dandridge much better and alos was better in ""Why do fools fall in love."""
1,2nd worst movie ever,"...the academy has the audacity to award a horrible performance like ms berry's is hard to believe.. politics, politics, hollywood doesn't award great performances anymore (examble russell crow for ""a beautiful mind"") it just gives awards to whoever they choose good performance or not.. her performance was truly embarrassing...i found myself laughing through most of the movie..the sex scene was gross and over the top..you know,, the only performance i can even note as halfway believable was sean combs as the convicted man.. he was very good.. other than that please don't waste the money to rent this movie.. it is truly a ""monster"" as its name says......"
1,The Truth,"worst movie ever, don't even watch it! pointless story, with a good cast! how could anyone do any worse? don't even think about watching this film, u r too good for it!"
2,halle is mediocre,"An hour and a half of this movie was all I could take. I never once bought into Halle Berry's performance. Her dialect came across as more phony and forced than natural. Her ""give me what I want scene"" was meant to be taken seriously but she was so stodgy I couldnt help but laugh. The other actors are decent. The movie would have been great if it had been about Billy Bob and Mos Defs characters."
1,This Mess is not fit for a Porno so WHY an Oscar?,"Somebody please tell me what is this? This movie was done poorly, Im thinking maybe an amateur wrote the story line. The acting was also poor to say the least, nothing about this flick was intriquing enough to a win certificate, let alone an Oscar. The sex scenes were wack and tacky and Halle's little boy was not believable in his resemblance to his parents and the scene where he was crying was also sooooo fake looking. I was not inspired only moved to get up and turn it off. My only qusetion is.........Who's Idea was this? One Love."
4,"Clear, concise, and chock full of information","I am a landscape design student and we used this book to cover Herbaceous Plant Materials I & II. I found the book very useful as it contained all information necessary, with drawings and pictures. It contained about 95% of all the plants covered (of course I guess that's on the whim of the professor). I'm sure it will be a useful tool once I'm working in the field. And it's definitely a lot cheaper here than at the bookstore at college."
4,An excellent reference on landscape grasses and perennials.,I sell ornamental landscape perennials and grasses for a prominent North American ornamental plant grower and it never fails to impress me how many of the plants used in today's landscaping are found in this book! I refer to it weekly at minimum. A must for any serious horticulturalist.
5,good reference and learning book,"I purchased this book to assist in my learning as I am presently taking horticulture classes and need a reference book for herbaceous plants. Also, am designing a landscape and this book is excellent - particularly like the color photos"
4,"Great Book, But please advise if new editions are coming.","Great Book, but wish a new edition was out there for all the breeding for top performance the industry has made in the past 15 years. Many great plants not mentioned. At 18 years old there have been some additions of new plants and I was hoping an update might soon be around."
4,Excellent Information,"You do need to have some background in horticulture to use this book, but it has a lot of information."
2,"A doctoral thesis. Oh, joy! Just what I didn't need.","From the books description, I expected selections from and explications of Franz Rosenzweig's Star of Redemption. No joy! This is barely English. This is the arcane stuff that shows you why no one ever recovers from a Ph.D. program. This is a doctoral thesis. There is nothing in here that any normal person can understand or use."
2,time has moved on,"I once owned all the MacDonald books in paperback. That was the only way they came. I had ""The House Guests"" and enjoyed it. That was maybe 30 or even 40 years ago. ""The House Guests"" disappeared. So I got this copy. What went wrong when I read it? Have I changed so much? The times? Cats seem about the same to me. Maybe MacDonald was depressing back then and I didn't see it. Anyway, unless you enjoy a good downer stay away from this book."
2,Too hard - choking hazard - go with the bites or vines instead.,"I give this product 2 stars because the taste is really good, and the ingredients are natural and I did not have an allergic reaction.But this product is really hard. Nearly impossible to chew. I almost choked on it a few times before giving up. I'll have to throw the whole case away - I can't eat them. I even tried microwaving the laces for about 20 seconds, which helped, but as soon as they cooled down they went hard again.My advice is to stick with the vines or the bites, the bites being the softest of all. I am off to order a case of raspberry bites...."
1,Don't Buy From This Company!,"I would rank them with negative stars if I could!!!I purchased this item from Allegro Enterprises Inc. and when it didn't arrive for several weeks, I purchased something else. Then, when it finally showed up, I tried to return it unopened but they refused! There doesn't appear to be one place on the website that indicates that they don't except returns. Their own staff members couldn't find the location where they state that this isn't returnable. I wouldn't buy anything from a company that appears to be so shoddy in its business practices!!!"
5,Agnes Pflumm and the Stonecreek Science Fair,"I love this book! I bought it at an NSTA convention five years from the author and have used it every year since. The story is entertaining, but at the same time teaches my 5th graders about choosing a science fair topic, completing research, presenting to judges, and designing controlled experiments. I have developed activities and discussions from the suggested lesson plans in the back of the book. The most valuable part of this book is the idea that students should choose a topic about which they have a real interest. Since I began using this book, my students' projects have shown more creativity and thoroughness, and a higher level of quality than in years past."
3,Pretty good show!,"Ok, this one is better then the first Ausin (Man Of Mystery) but not quite as good as Austin 2 (Shagged Me). Still pretty funny though! If you like Austin buy it, if not... at LEAST rent it, it's definatly worth watching! They left it open for another, I hope it gets filmed! The trailer had some scenes that weren't in the movie, weird!!"
5,The best movie ever!,"Austin Powers in Goldmember was by far the funniest movie I have ever seen! If you liked the first 2 you will love this one. This Austin Powers movie is the best out of the 3. There is no down time between funny parts in the movie. It has a awesome cast with many, many famous people in it , which makes it even more funny. I just hope Mike Myers can pull it off another time."
1,"Puerile, bathroom humor with American sentimentality","It's been done before. This movie adds nothing to its predecessors except for a lot of sentimentality, one suspects to attract the greater American public and their almighty dollars.The humor resorts to the bathroom and below in an effort to come up with a few laughs.Maybe he should change his name to Austin Texas. There wasn't much in the way of Power here...A waste of money: wait for the TV reruns if you really have to see it."
5,Goldmember,"Goldmember staring Mike Myers and Beyonce Knowles is the best Austin Powers yet. It's full of hilarious cameos including Tom Cruise, Britney Spears and the Osbouns. This movie takes a huge spin at the end, DO NOT TELL THE ENDING, i give this movie 5 stars. This is one movie you do NOT wanna miss!!!"
3,At times very funny but not as good as A. Powers 2,"First of all let me give the parents out there a warning. AP in Goldmember is a PG 13, but probally should be a mild R. This would be for the langage used.That Being said this is a very funny movie at times, though not as funny as number 2. The problem with this movie is that the first two were spoofs on the 60s spy movies, this does not happen in this movie at all. AP has become a name brand in and of itself. There are twists and turns in this movie that are good but I think the series is showing its age. Or perhaps I am showing mine."
2,please... this was awful,"This movie was nothing but joke after joke. The first to Austin Powers movies were funny, but they also had decent story line. Austin 3 has a weak story line and the bathroom jokes were utterly wrong. The only thing I got a kick out of was seeing the big name stars in their cameo roles that was funny, but the rest of the movie bit dirt. Don't waste your time with this one."
2,Bathroom humor grossed me out!,"I wanted to like this movie, but I think I'm the wrong demographic. I'm a 38 year-old woman, and though the 70's theme and ""Yeah, Baby!"" stuff was lots of fun, I couldn't get past the poop, pee, and penis references throughout. I think teenage boys and all men will love it, though!"
5,groovy baby.. yeah!!,i have one word for this movie it was GROOVY!! Austin is back to defeat a new enemy named Goldmember. Ill sum it up for you: austin finds out that dr.evil and himself are brothers and that nigel powers is both of their fathrs. Mini Me joins the ministry of defence and helps defeat the evil orginisation overall it was a very funny movie and Foxy Cleopatra(beonce knoles) was very good for the part when it comes out on DVD i will be the first to have it. it is a must see it is worh evry penny so go out and see it.
1,TERRIBLE!,"Horribly unfunny, almost painful to watch - tries to rely on jokes that wouldn't even make a third grader laugh. This is one of the worst movies we've EVER seen. Please don't waste your time!! YUCK!!"
3,A Bit More Original Than Austin Powers 2,"""Goldmember,"" like ""The Spy Who Shagged Me,"" sees a lot of the jokes from the first film recycled. However, I like ""Goldmember"" better than Austin Powers 2 because I feel that it offered a little bit more originality. This doesn't mean that it's neccessarily funnier, though.The best departure from Austin Powers 2 is the addition of the Foxy Cleopatra character, who gives the film a completely different spin from the first two Austin Powers movies.The ""Hard Knock Life"" video between Dr. Evil and Mini-Me is exceptionally funny, as is the interaction between Austin Powers and his father.However, I disliked the ending, and also felt that the ""Goldmember"" character himself was irrelevant to the plot.Better than Austin Powers 2, but just can't compare to the original."
2,Swollen Member,"Wow, talk about recycled jokes!Okay, there's maybe 2 really funny scenes in the whole movie. Those being the only jokes that weren't regurgitated from ""The Spy Who Shagged Me"". Then after that, there's a few chuckles here and there. But nothing really balls-to-the-wall funny. The problem with Goldmember is it thinks it's hysterical, when in actuality the jokes are tired, beyond childish (even by typical Austin Powers standards) and just flat-out embarrassing. The fact that it's the third film in the series doesn't excuse it's lack of creativity. This thing is preposterously bad. A one trick pony, all the way. Just another addition to Comatose Comedy. There's been a rash of them lately."
4,Review of 'Austin Powers In Goldmember',"I found the movie very funny. I would recommend the film to anybody after a good laugh. The Austin Powers spoof movie at the beginning starring Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey and Danny DeVito is very funny! The storyline is great and the new characters Nigel Powers and Foxxy Cleopatra were great! Just go and watch this movie!"
1,CRIKIE!! Are You KIDDING Me!?,"Beyonce of destiny's child!!!...YUCK!!... You can't understand a word she says!!!...She's a WORSE choice than Heather Graham was in sequel#2!!!! ~~~Spare Me, Baby!!~~~~~"
2,disappointing,"I bought this DVD with the expectation that the third Austin Powers movie would be at least as funny as the preceding two ones: well, all I can say is that I can't remember having laughed many times... Apart from this, I think that the plot could have been a lot better: the movie just doesn't seem to proceed right after the opening scenes (which I think are great by the way) I also got the impression that the producers have 'borrowed' too much from the first two movies, which made me feel like I was watching a new version of the the second Austin Powers movie... Many jokes from the first two movies are 'revised'... Also, I think that the new Goldmember character has not contributed much to the movie and is more like bizarre than funny...All in all, I would recommend you to buy the the first two Austin Powers movies which are much funnier than this one..."
1,Just not funny....,"Goldmember is the epitome of the tired, recycled, over-produced garbage that Hollywood puts out specifically for the sake of fast food tie-ins. There's hardly an original moment in the entire movie. This fact must not have escaped the writers, because it's brought up in a joke or two (which seems like a way to cover up thier laziness). As for Beyonce's acting, well I'm happy to say she didn't embarrass herself. Not that it matters. She could have been completely edited out and you would still have virtually the same film. The only reason I can come up with her being there is to sell movie tickets, dvd's, soundtracks, and so on. Anyway, if you're one of the lucky few who haven't seen this movie I'd recommend keeping it that way. But if you still feel that you must, do yourself a favor and rent it first."
1,Straight from the Devil's Torture Pit.....,"Most reviewers of this dreck start off by saying ""I loved the first movie but..."". I don't give this series of filmed train wrecks that much credit. The first one hurt my eyes and brain, the second one was completely unwatchable and this one is just plain evil. It is like the writers thought ""the last one was full of stupid jokes, lets pour alot more into the third version of the same story!"" Bad idea.It is a sad commentary on how inept comedy film writers have become; to create an unfunny waste of a film like this."
2,Not as good as the first two,"This movie is just not as funny as the first two. In addition, somehow number 2 is back, even though he died in the first movie. Austin Powers's father has a hatred for Dutch people that the movie doesn't explain. There is an attempt to get as many actors in this movie as possible. I regret not seeing this movie in the theater because I would not have bought it."
3,"Good, not great","I was sick over New Years, so I watched this movie with a friend. I haven't yet seen the first movie, but I've seen the second, so I kind of knew the jist of the ""Austin Powers"" movies.This one features a lot of the same jokes, most of which have just been rehashed from the previous movies. Same basic scenario: Austin travels back in time to save the world, meets up with some girl, and they team up to save the world together.Though this movie did have strong sexual themes, they weren't quite as strong as those in ""The Spy Who Shagged Me"".The first part of the movie with Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito, etc. was hilarious. I think that was surely one of the funniest parts of the movie.If you are having a relaxing night at home, this movie will give you a couple of good laughs."
3,Better than the first two,"Although nothing Mike Meyers has done recently has come even close to as great as So I Married an Axe Murderer, at least this is better than the first two Austin Powers movies. The first 10 minutes of this movie are side-splittingly funny and worth watching repeatedly, after that I can't say much. Beyonce Knowles is definitely the best sidekick so far. She is beautiful, funny, and knows how to sing and she never does more with Austin then give him a tiny kiss. This movie is slightly less vulgar than the others, but still a crass movie. I give it 2.5 stars."
3,"Still A Funny Movie, but it doesn't stop it's predecessors","The First Austin Powers with never lose it's magic. I could watch it a hundred times and I will always laugh. This movie doesn't have that. Too much repeats of the jokes. The whole ""shhh"" thing has gotten to become retarded. Too little effort to make this any better than the original."
3,It was just funny.,"If you haven't seen one of these you should. It will make anyone laugh at all the comical things that are said throughout the movie. Wouldn't buy anymore because ""one"" movie like this is enough"
2,Gold-dud!,"Let me start out by saying I am a huge fan of the series. I have a very easy going sense of humor and it takes a lot to bore me. Well guess what, this one bored me. The Goldmember guy is a really stupid character and the plot is not all that funny. This movie must have been thrown together in a hurry because I could have easily written a better script givin the success and the characters in the series. I highly recommend waiting for this one to come out on cable and save your money. If you plan on giving this one as a christmas gift keep your eyes on the auction sites the day after christmas I'm sure you will see it again."
3,Eh. Not bad.,"I laughed a bit at this movie, but it just wasn't as much fun as I was expecting. The extras were top-notch, though."
5,sweetest Austin yet and the best in the series,"I thought that the series had run out of originality, Mike Myers has to prove me wrong. The first ten minutes are so creative and packed full of cameos (and if you tell your friends who the cameos appearances are &#65533; your friends will never forgive you) that it sets the pace for the rest of the film perfectly. Even the jokes that he has used in past films he somehow manages to renew and make fresh again. For those parents out there &#65533; watch out &#65533; this is a very risqué film and should probably have been rated R. That being said, the adult humor is what makes this film so great in the first place.If you thought the first and second in the series were groovy, you're going to love the third"
1,Absolutely Dreadful! Pure Trash!,"This movie is about as weak and unfunny as they come. Minime's character is brought to new lows (sorry, no pun intended) and does for midgets what ""Birth of a Nation"" did for Blacks. Filled with fourth-grade bathroom humor, unfunny gags, the nonacting of Beyonce (but hey, her scenes work with the sound down). Nah. The second Austin Powers film was not bad and the crude humor was at least mildly amusing. This time around, the crude humor is just crude!"
3,it would have been better without Beyonce or Britney!,"Mike Myers, next time you make an Austin Powers film, do not have pop star idiots. Beyonce absolutely sucks playing Foxxy Cleopatra. they should have used Diana Ross or any other African-American girl that sung in the Seventies. Beyonce was born in 1982. what does she have to do with the 1970's ? I said it before, and i'll say it again: Destiny's Child SUCKS! and I'll say this for the record: Britney Spears SUCKS too!"
2,2 was enough,"To tell you the truth, i've never really been a big fan of the Austin Powers movies, but i really thought there was no need for a third. The first two were enough laughs for everyone who enjoys these movies and Mike Myers should use his talents and create something new. I think i may of prefered it if it came out a few years later as in 'the long awaited movie' and then it would have been more enjoyable."
1,Terrible - Don't buy - Do Rent!,"I rented this movie, before I would buy it, and boy, I am sure glad I did. This movie was terrible. This movie sucked.Even though there was a surprise ending, the rest of the movie just was no where near the calibre of the first two.In conclusion, don't buy this. Rent it. Pay the 4 bucks to rent it, instead of the 20 bucks to buy it. You'll appreciate it."
2,"Same Old, Same Old...","I won't hesitate a second longer - 'Goldmember' was terrible. The first sequel,' The Spy Who Shagged Me', was bad enough but this really stretches the franchise way too far and over the top.I would have thought that the writers would have come up with some new material but no, its still the same 'Yeeeah Baby' and 'Very Shagadelic' one liners which bring down this films' credibility even more. It's only saving grace are the vast amount of cameos near the beginning, from then on; its trash. The overused 'mole' joke really gets on your nerves after a while and is just another blatant lack of fresh ideas for this third instalment. Even the appearance of Destiny's Child beauty Beyonce Knowles isn't enough to keep you interested. For real comedy, just stick to the first film."
1,Terrible Movie -- Avoid,"Considering I was only able to watch about 15 minutes of this movie before I had to consign it to oblivion, you might want to weight my review lightly (after all, the movie might have gotten better at the 16 minute mark). But, essentially, this ""movie"" consists of a slew of Mike Myers spots (poor ones at that), interspersed with something to hang them together. It's essentially the same thing that happens with the later Eddie Murphy movies: we've got a star, let's show everyone how great he thinks he is. Stick with the first two movies (the first one's excellent and the second on is good) and avoid this one like the plague. I rate it at a terrible 1 star out of 5."
3,Funnier Than #2,"I found this movie to be more entertaining than the 2nd installment so in that sense it was an improvement, however I would like to know why Beyonce was cast in this film? She is atractive, yes, but so is a good portion of Hollywood women and believe it or not-- Black Hollywood women if that is what their aim was. But alas, I have chalked it up to some good dealing with through her management and tried to look beyond her role at the overall movie. It was decent and I did laugh enough to say it is worth renting. Owning the DVD, on the other hand, is for those who want the deleted scenes which they did a god job of packaging."
2,Three is enough,"Not bad, but I seriously think that the AUSTIN POWERS horse has run it's course. Let me put it this way, I liked Goldmember more than I did ""Wayne's World 2"" but nowhere near as much as I liked ""So I married an axe murderer""Stick to Shrek Mike, or invent something new, your'e clever enough!!"
2,"Poorly put together, worst of the series","The few entertaining visuals and star cameo appearances can't make up for this meandering disappointment. The elements from the prior movies are present, but much of the wit is gone. Overall, although I didn't expect much, I was disappointed."
3,Disappointing,"The first two Austin Powers movies were hilarious, particularly the second one. ""Goldmember,"" however, demonstrates that the franchise may be running out of steam. The film is cluttered with too many characters, as if Mike Myers can't bear to leave anyone out of the party. They take turns trotting out their schtick, which is largely repeated from earlier films in the series. The new character, Goldmember, is just disgusting rather than funny.There are some great stand-out moments and surprising cameos, but the overall result is a disappointment."
3,It has its moments,"I'm a big fan of the first 2, but this one just seemed unnecessary. Most of the jokes in this one are recycled from the 2nd one and other jokes were just stupid. The only funny moments came mostly with scenes that had dr evil in them and the ""mole"" scenes were pretty funny to. But, even some of the scenes with dr evil were kinda stupid. The opening credits thing was really stupid to, it just went too far with the cameos. I really only bought this one cause it was like 5 bucks at compusa. Overall: If you've seen the first two, just stick with those cause you won't be getting anything new from this one."
3,"Great Opening Sequence, but Falls Flat","Yes, the title sequence at the beginning of ""Goldmember"" is al all star classic, with cameos by Tom Cruise, Gwyneth Paltrow, Steven Speilberg, Danny DiVito and many others offering a laugh-out-loud 10 minutes. But after that, ""Goldmember"" is a hodge-podge of uninspired and been-there-done-that dialogue from the great Mike Meyers. I'd really hoped for a more lively episode, along the lines of the first two movies, and was clearly disappointed. Beyonce Knowles - GORGEOUS HERE - is solid as Foxy Cleopatra, but the rest of the cast seems like they are just going through the motions. Even Meyers himself seems to be channeling SNL characters rather than focusing on making this funny. Let's hope the next Austin Powers movie finds him back in real fine shape, bay-bee."
3,"rehashed sequel, no suprises except opening","well you do think your going to be in for a treat after the first scene, this was a nice touch, but aftrewards it pretty much descends into a complete rehash of the second film, which was much funnier, myers seems to think that mini-me is so funny that over half the jokes revolve around him hitting or being hit, wears thin.must try harder."
3,"Liked the movie, DVD itself doesn't work properly","I also have problems playing this DVD on a one year old DVD player, except my copy will freeze up every few minutes to a still picture; very aggravating. I have tried two copies of this DVD; same result. However, the dumb thing plays just fine on a new $100 special I bought for a second TV in the house. Unless you have a brand new DVD player, I would expect problems with this thing."
2,Why did they do this??,"I found myself pondering a few question while watching this movie. like why did they make it? how is this funny? how many times are they going to use the same cheap joke so they can avoid actually working on a decent film? Honestly, if i would have paid 20 dollars for my wife and i to see this, the movie theater would have one less employee."
2,Fairly lame retread,"The first two were great (they still make me giggle today), but Goldmember has seriously little to offer. The Foxy Cleopatra character makes previous female foils seem downright literary in their complexity. The Goldmember character is incomprehensibly stupid and underexplained. The Fat Bastard poop-jokes are tired. And on and on. Is this to say there are absolutely no laughs to be had? Of course not, but not enough to reward staring at the thing for almost two hours."
2,Disappointed,"I was not very happy with the DVD. I was unable to pause, fast forward, rewind, etc. The makers of the DVD clearly did not do their job when it came to code for all types of machines. I felt the makers of the movie did a big injustace because of the bleeps and images they fuzzed out to give the movie a PG-13 rating. If the makers wanted to make a PG-13 movie, they should have filmed it properly."
4,"""Goldmember"" Infinifilm DVD worth its weight in Gold","The minute you get the DVD , skip everything and go straight to the Deleted scenes . There was 15 scenes that ranks from soso to utterly funny like ""book covers"",""idiot convention"",""More fooks"",""Hello Mahza,Hello Fahza"",""More Fahza"",""Dr evil has the con"",""Bad reaction to the sharks"". Don't miss the ""Musical Number""(which should follow after Austin and Nigel go separate ways but was not cut into the movie), after a few times the song is actually good and there is a funny scene with Goldmember.I enjoy those as much as the movie itself. Plus you get the commentary from Jay Roach and Myers. Music videos from Beyonce(Work it out),Britney(Boys),Ming Tea(Daddy wasn't there) and Dr Evil & Minime(Hard Knock Life). The trailers and other featurets were also included . The movie is presented in wide screen format .All in all a great package!"
3,Fair at best!,"The Austin Powers series may go down as profitable but it will not reach the heights of the great comic films of all time. There is so much one can do with phallic and other genitalia humor. Also, flatulence jokes can only permeate the air for so long. References to the female's mammary glands can get ""dry"" after a while.Maybe, for 14-year-old boys ""Goldmember"" is great art. But, for the rest of us, it's a joke that wore out its welcome two films ago."
2,Mild,"I loved the first two, but this one is just not very funny. I'm sorry, but Goldmember disgusted me, and his antics were not at all amusing. You never hear anyone on the street saying ""Haha look at me I eat my own skin and have balls made of gold!"" Plus his accent was non-descript. It's not like fat bastard where people actually liked him.Beyonce is a horrible actress. I rather like her music, but she simply has no talent when it comes to acting like something she's not (a 70's swingin roller girl or whatever she was supposed to be).most of the jokes were reused from the first two movies, and simply not as funny or shocking as they were before.i'd love to see an austin powers 4, but mr meyers please find some new jokes, and vixens that [aren't bad] at acting."
1,No better than Preparations A - G.,Don't get me wrong; I like a good fart joke as much as the next person. But the there are 2 problems with Goldmember. The first is obvious--its not funny. The second is how many things are just disgusting..like picking your own skin and eating it. Now that's a kneeslapper!!
2,Austin oh Austin,"Alright let me say that this movie is [junk],as a big fan of the first 2 movies i'm shocked to say that but it is.I really tried with this one,i saw it 4 times just to find it good but it didn't work.You can tell that alot of money was put into this movie with all the celebrity cameo's but it was to the point of ""cut it out already"" so before i keep bringing down this one let me give you the plot. Dr.Evil is back from space and he has his headquarters in hollywood and they are using a talent agency to fuel the money for another ""evil"" plot.First of all beyonce knowles [stinks] as an actress and i say that in a nice way.The character goldmember is not funny and he eats his skin. Austin powers is not funny and his lines get repetitive.Dr Evil is a little better but he drags. Mini me is still cute but the cuteness wears out.Fat Bastard makes a brief apperance, the dvd extras [are awful] and that makes this a piece of trash. But thats my opinion."
1,PLEASE....,"Im sorry, but Austin Powers simple doesnt belong in the 70's....Why didnt they do a movie about one of his earlier adventures before Vanessa and Felicity?...And as for having Beyonce Knowles co-star in it, she can't act to save her life. Actually, she really doesnt do anything in it but stand there and look sexy...The humor is almost completely different than the first two. Too much bathroom humor. Even though im not a big fan of Austin Powers, I can easily say that the first two are the only ones worth seeing..."
3,Not really that Gold-en,"The latest installment of Austin Powers is more of a episodic event of sight-gags and one liners than a coherent film. Pushed unceremoniously into the background are Frau Farbissima and No.2, and not even a glimpse of Will Ferrell as Mustafa...alas!The real title Should have been Austin Powers and Mini-Me, since so much was spent on Verne Troyer, which wasn't bad, but at the expense of the other characters.The newest nemesis here is Goldmember, who really didn't amount to much in the film.Not nearly as good as the first two Powers films, it was still a non-stop run of hilarity, from the shadow sequence, the water fountain profiles and Japanese subtitles to Scott finally getting ""Evil"".Look for plenty of laughs, but not for characters or a decent plot."
3,"OK movie, bad DVD","No matter what you thought of the movie as a movie, the DVD is very flawed. Not the image or the sound, mind you -- they're great. And, yes, even the extras are sort of fun. No, what's wrong with this disc is the ""Infinifilm"" coding. In order for that to operate, other features on the disc are disabled: ""fast forward"", ""pause"", and ""rewind."" That is, you can only stop the film outright (no freeze-frame pauses), and you can only jump forward and backwards by chapters (no zooming ahead or backwards). Bummer."
2,Austin losing Power,The third of the Austin Powers trilogy definitly doesn't carry the surprises and uniqueness of the first two. Primarily a rehash of previous characters and skits. Our family was basically bored with this movie about half way through. Kind of disappointing after the first two movies.
3,Can we say-overkill just a bit?,"I loved both Austin Powers movies, but this is going a bit far in my opinion. I fear it may suffer from ""sequel-itis"".And-I agree that Knowles was a bad choice for the new sidekick. From the previews I've seen, she is over-acting way too badly. She's trying way to hard to be a ""good"" actress-and it'll smother Austin's style of humor in the movie, in my opinion. (And I HATE that afro-*shudders*)Other than that-I'm always happy to watch a kick-back, just plain fun ""stupid"" movie. Meyers is VERY talented and in my opinion-surprisingly classy in his humor. And-the music's pretty cool too.Hope everyone enjoys it-I'll be there when it opens. :-)"
2,A Disgrace To The Series.,"The first 15 minutes of this movie is the funniest thing about this movie.There are some other funny parts,but this movie is weak.The character Goldmember ruined the movie.This movie is dissapointing.The best Austin Powers movie is,and forever will be,Part 2.Peace Out"
3,"Should have stopped at ""The Spy..."" 2.5 stars","When seeing the Austin Powers: Goldmember I thought it was an average comedy. Seriously they Mike Myers should have stopped at the second one. I didn't think that this was very necessary. The plot made no sense, (even though I thought it was kind of nice to go back into the 1970's). The new addition of the characters was pointless, and personally Beyonce should stick to singing, because she cannot act."
4,Beyonce` and Austin made made this movie rock!,"I went to go see this movies the night of it's opening premeire, and of course the theater was packed, and this movie was so so funny that everybody in the whole theater would laugh and the theater would literally shake from all the laughter. And as a result of such a funny outcome i'm going to go see it again tonight (yesterday was july 26th and and tonight is the 27th). This was by far one of the most funniest movies i've ever seen seen, and i highly recommend that you see it!and Beyonce` was a great touch to it!"
3,austin,austin powers is my favorite secret agent... so i ought to have liked it... just that... you've seen one and you've seen them all... the product arrived in great condition... amazon service has been excellent...
2,"Mildly Amusing, Occasionally Clever, More Often Not","I liked the first of the Powers Trilogy, thought the second had some very funny bits but was disappointed by Goldmember. The opening scene was clever with all of the movie within a movie gags. I figured we were in for a real roller coaster ride. Yeah, unfortunately, the ride was mostly down hill. The movie is a loosely joined collection of skits about toilet humor, sexual innuendo and a few (very few) funny (very funny) sight gags. My friends at work, some 15 years my junior, all hated it. I give it 2 stars because there are some fun parts that are probably worth seeing. If you really like Mike Myers films, you will enjoy Goldmember. This DVD version has the Infinifilm feature and it's really a pretty cool add-in."
2,Disappointing,"If you've seen the first two movies of this series, which are just too good, then you've seen just about every joke in Goldmember. Just got a bit too tedious to listen to ""Oh behave"" without any really new angles of humor. Mini-Me defecting was random. There was no real chemistry between Austin and his latest babe. And yes, we're tired of the time travel business. If you really have nothing to do and want to watch a movie, just rewatch the first two in this series."
3,"Mike Meyers does it again, yeah baby","Austin Powers in Goldmember is another great film in the shagadelic series. From the opening spoof AustinPussy one knows it's gonna be a great film. The jokes are on taregt , the script is witty and the cameos are great.Beyonce does a good acting job, despite what the critics said as her performances really just requires her to be eye candy. All in all a fun film."
3,Wonderfully juvenile,"One joke, gag, spoof, takeoff after another. If one falls flat, don't worry there is another coming right up. Several terrific cameo appearences. Mini-me steals every scene he's in. It's worth seeing the movie just for the opening, it is Fantastic. A good summer movie -- go see it."
5,Still Got the Power!,"Everyone said that it was extremley boring! I thought iut was great! Loads of selebreties, loads of new and old jokes! Yeah, some jokes got a BIT boring but over all u gotta c it! I think u would enjoy it more if u havn't seen all of them, the jokes get a bit boring, but then again I saw all 3 and I don't regret seeing it! If u have seen all of them, u will under stand it more, but if u haven't, u will defently find it funnyer, but u might not understand the twist @ the end, I think that if u have seen it or not, it is sure a gotta c movie!!!"
3,a guilty treat,"Okay, lets face it. The Austin Powers movies are not great films, but they make you laugh. Mike Myers likes to appeal to the 13 yr old boy in all of us and he does this again with ""Goldmember"", the third installment in his Austin Powers series. I think the other two were a little bit better than this one but I still think it was an enjoyable film. If you wanna go out with some friends and just have some stupid laughs, then this is the film you should see. I was hoping we would see more out Michael Caine but his part was still funny, none-the-less. The cameos that start the film are funny and worth the admission. Beyonce Knowles, of Destiny's Child, did a nice job as the Foxy Cleopatra, the new Austin Powers babe. Go, don't expect Oscar caliber performances, and just have fun."
2,Not very Funny and Not Very Good,"I went in with very high expectations since I liked the 1st two installments a lot. The problem with this was trying to make every scene funny and it got old, dumb, and boring. There were probaly about 4 or 5 scenes that I actually laughed at. I decided that it might be like the original when each time you see it you find something new. This was wrong and I found myself wanting to get up and leave. Its funny how people in the audience would fake laugh at certain parts which they knew weren't funny but they almost felt obliged to.p.s. If you miss the 1st 5 minutes of the movie, then just leave because those were the most entertaining of the movie."
1,This movie [is weak]!,"I loved loved LOVED the first two movies, but I would have given this movie NO stars if that was an option. Other than a few chuckles (mostly in the first six minutes), this movie is a total dog...There's no story, the jokes have mostly been done before, and there's no charm. Please, Mike Meyers, DON'T make an Austin Powers 4 unless you have a script that is better than the original. Folks, don't waste your money on this one!"
4,Better than expected,"I was very fortunate to see this at an early screening. I went in excited for a new Austin Powers film, but prepared to be disappointed. However, there were many funny moments, and the Goldmember character is hilarious. I think the Austin Powers saga has ended and there's no need for an additional film, but this one is worth seeing if you enjoyed the first two (as I did)."
5,The Funniest Movie Ever,As a major fan of Austin Powers I was dying to see the third part. It was for sure the best cinema experiece I have ever had in my life. I laughed so hard that tears were literally pouring out of my eyes. After the movie I was physically exhausted from laughing. I absolutely recommend it... but it is definately better when you watch the first two parts as many times as possible. The dvd also has excellent deleted scenes! Mike Myres is brilliant! Definately the best comedy movie ever...
1,Winner of the Golden Fleece Award!,"... I had heard it was not so good, but I did not realize how horrible this film is. The plot moves so slowly and jerkily that Mike Myers' poorly thought-out comedy sequences seem like intermissions! There were only about three people in the theater laughing at most jokes (one low-voltage fellow down front with that nerdy laugh--I wanted to kick him). I only laughed twice (well, half-laughed). The ""mole"" thing was inane (Fred Savage needs to salvage his career now) and the celebrity cameos were just a whiff of fragrance that slightly distracted us from the foul smell emanating from the screen. This is the only movie I have -ever- walked out of, and I only wish I had done so sooner. Fortunately Mike Myers does not have any of my money; ) as I was more than glad to give it to Mr. Diesel, who makes up for all the dreadful Bond films of late. Goldmember is just that bad."
2,better to get the bootleg...,the first ten mins. was funny and the jail scene and and shadow but the first one was way more funnier. and beyonce was trying to hard act and any way all she was saying is i'm foxxy cleopatra. she was much better in mtv's hip-hopera (carmen).
1,"Make it stop, please!","Following in the proud tradition of lousy sequels that have plagued America in recent years (Blair Witch 2, Blade 2, etc.), this is another example of the ""dumbing down"" of America. The original Austin Powers was good - it was funny, and was a good parody. The sequels have been detestable. Story and effort are once again compromised for lame bits that play like short skits from Saturday Night Live."
2,What the heck?!,"Most people in this world are busy, so I will not wase your time. Let me start off by saying that this movie is very poor. Sure the begining is pretty good, but then it justs gets weaker and weaker. The ending is just plain BAD. There is no other word for it. Dr. Evil turns out to be Austin's brother?! What's up with that? If you really want to, rent it. I would never wase my money on...like this."
4,Color confusion,"Lovely quality; however, the colors in the pillow did not look as pictured. Specifically the lime green in the embroidery. I've found it's usually hard to tell actual colors online (maybe my computer?). I returned the pillow."
2,"Not loud enough, too big, but good price.","I wanted a basic memo voice recorder to give as a gift. This was the cheapest one I could find that had a decent amount of features. But, it somewhat shows how cheap it is...The size of this recorder (according to the specs) appears to be about the same as other competing units, but it is actually a little bigger than it should be. If it was about an inch shorter, it would fit better in your hand. The recording quality is a little scratchy, but my main complaint is that it doesn't play loud enough to hear it without turning up the volume so much that its audio quality is very scratchy.Another problem is it makes clicking sounds through the speaker when buttons are pressed or options are changed. I would only recommend this recorder for very limited voice memo activities and when you are looking for a cheaper device."
1,A waste of money,"I had bought this unit somewhere else, and the next day it went right back. VOX did not work as described, and the sound quality was worse than the worst worn-out micro tape unit I have ever had the displeasure to listen to. In the electronics world, the word ""digital"" implies pristine, crisp sound, yet this unit not only plays back as if you spoke through a folded towel, it also swallows entire syllables. Makes me shy away from other Memorex products. I'm amazed they even put such a stinker on the market."
5,Just what I was looking for,"The price was right. It performs well with one hand and yes it is a little scratchy sounding at full volume, but I put it up to my ear anyway so that others around me can't hear. I just hope it lasts for at least 1 year. That was the lifespan of my last (radioshack brand) voice recorder. By the way, the size is about right. It's not so small that it gets lost in your pocket yet not so large that it won't fit along with your keys and a pack of gum."
2,Think Twice Buy Never,"Okay this is a ""value"" priced digital recorder. It does largely perform as advertised. The problem is that if you really need a digital recorder, than you will need a better model than this. Otherwise you will find you use this a few times and than it sits in a drawer. Save your bucks and buy something you really need."
3,Incompatable,"VSX-917V-K Real nice rec/amp but complex instructions. Not a ""Plug in and use"". I expected total compatablity with other Pioneer unts I had (CD Player PD-M406) and discovered not all functions on the CD player worked via remote (Dis Sel should index to next cd in six pack but did not). When I contacted Customer Service they responded right away (""Real Person"") and reviewed with Engineering, Reported ""Function fas not coded"" in this unit). Interesting to note, my 1988 VSX 9300S remote did control this function so I knew it had to be the logic in the remote not the set up connections.BTW Amazon was fantistic in handleing the refund and all charges have been credited to my C Cd acct."
2,Pioneer VSX-917V-K Home Theater Receiver (Black),"I'm not happy with this reciever at all, Even with the HDMI cables you still have to hook up audio cables to get sound from each device you hook up. Also you have to have the reciever on anytime you have your tv on, you cannot watch and hear your TV while listening to say a CD at the same time."
4,Almost perfect,"My old TEAC A/V amp started dying about a year ago, but once it was unable to switch between analog & digital sources I had to give in. This was recommended by someone online, and the price was right so I bought it. So far it's been great! It switches quickly and really simplified my setup. The only downside is that while it will upconvert anything to HD, it won't downconvert. In other words, while I can watch a composite input on the HDMI or component outputs, I can't watch HD sources on my analog TV through the composite or SVID outputs. Other than that complaint, it's been a wonderful unit."
4,Nice Piece,"I'm very happy with this receiver, it has a lots ofpower and sounds great through my JBL'S. I'm not even usingthe surround sound capabilitys yet but just the stereomode sounds great with the CD's, DVD'S, and TV.It looks great too with the blue lights."
3,"Overall good, but gets hot, remote doesn't control all devices","We bought this to replace an old Pioneer receiver that was no longer working. It has the capability to be much more that what we need, so this is a limited review. It does get hot in our stereo cabinet when the glass door is closed if it is on for a few hours. I was disappointed with the remote. It will turn our non-Pioneer CD player on & off, but will not allow any other functions. Even to play a CD I have to go over to the unit and push the button. Also, we have a Pioneer duel cassette tape deck. The remote will not control that either. I was very disappointed with that since it is the same brand. That was one of the reasons I chose this item instead of another one, because it has a more comprehensive remote."
2,Tedious,"I only read this because it was a book club selection. Self-involved, Jung loved himself. Perhaps his fans/followers will love him more. Me? Not so much."
2,A hard slog,This is the first and probably last book I shall buy from Jung. I found it hard going and didn't inderstand it.
5,A Brilliant Autobiography,"Jung's Autobiography is highly readable, and thoroughly enjoyable. In an often mythic style, it demonstrates his commitment to the truth of experience. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the life of Jung and the events in his life that influenced his work."
5,Read and Reread,"This is a book that I read with intense interest, I walked around the house, this book in hand.C.G. Jung is caught here, his childhood, his quirks. He remains a very fascinating man. This is the only book about C.G. Jung I've read.I particularly liked the chapter ""Late Thoughts"", though the book in whole is very curiosity inspiring.Loved it."
2,He was so self-absorbed,"As much as I would have liked to learn about Jung's life I just couldn' finish this book. Jung comes across as so incredibly self-absorbed - it's only me, I, me, I and me again. He writes hundreds of pages about his most detailed inner experiences, yet there is not a single word about his relationship to his wife, children and mistresses. If I hadn't known that he was married with five children I would have assumed he was a complete hermit. Loving relationships seem to have meant nothing to this man. I honestly wonder how he could have been a good therapist. I also wonder why so many women have followed his teachings when quite obviously he held them in such low regard. I only hope that the reality was better than this book makes him out to be."
1,Very disappointed,The book arrived heavily water marked/damaged with biro marks on many pages ---- very disappointed as normally the books I purchase through Amazon are in good shape.I've already submitted this feedback to Amazon twice since I purchased the book and received no reply.
3,Standard Wyndham,"""Web"" deals with the evolution of a new species of spiders on a desert island. Their contact with humanity is (of course) rather disastrous. Web isn't bad, but Wyndham has done the same theme much better in other books. One might ask for a little more in the originality-department."
5,Excellent,There is nothing much you can say about a classic. A classic is a classic for a reason. Edith Wharton is undeniably one of the best American writers and this book of short stories is another proof of it. It is a mark of a true talent to be able in a matter of 20-25 pages to reveal both deep nature of characters and expose society follies. Each story is a masterpiece which leaves you with a deeper understanding of suffocating restrictions of 19th century America and complexities of human nature. This book is a must read for anyone who appreciates quality literature.
1,Warning: Kindle version is the single title story only,"I was rather shocked and disappointed that what I thought was a collection of short stories turned out to be a single short piece. I was aware of the price differential, but assumed it was due to the fact that one can obtain full-length Wharton books right here on Amazon for $0.00. I had hoped for a version with a degree of attentiveness in Kindle formatting usually lacking in the free offerings.I really feel cheated, as I expected to be purchasing ""Roman Fever AND OTHER STORIES"", a work of some 300-odd pages, not one of 10 if that. Unfortunately, Amazon apparently has no compunction--nor indeed financial incentive--to screen out such cuckoo's egg product imposters.This is not the first time I have run into materially different works being marketed as Kindle equivalents."
1,Misrepresented,"The ad for this bed stated that it came with a hand held control to make it easier to inflate and deflate the bed. Instead, it came with a motor that screwed into the bed which had to be plugged in, and unplugged, back and forth, to inflate, and you had to unscrew something on the motor to get it to deflate.If Amazon does not discipline this seller, they are only hurting themselves."
5,Good but not lasting,"The MRI hard tennis balls are good. We loved playing with them, they got the right amount of bounce and right amount of weight. Its good for fast bowling and slow spins. However the ball has no quality. We broke 3 balls in one day! We used tape balls before but those have no bounce, so the MRI balls wins, its pretty pricy for 6 balls that dont last too long. Hope they would sell it cheaper if it tends to last only a few overs.As for shipper, excellent rating to them, they shipped in ground and i got it in 5 days."
4,mri cricket tennis balls,"MRI cricket balls are nice and hard. They have excellent bounce and are great for nice pace bowling. There are issues:- the coating (the tennis finish) on them wears out really fast, and soon exposes a dark colored rubber interior (in abt 10 overs).- These balls crack if hit hard for a few times (a typical onslaught for 10 overs, say): this is almost impossible to happen with the conventional wilson tennis balls- they are wayyyy overpriced! I hope they reduce the price, this would be a great buy for about $10/six-pack.All in all, a nice product."
4,ATLANTIC MUST HAVE RELEASED THIS JUST TO FILL A VOID FOR THOSE WHO JUST HAD TO HAVE A NEW ARETHA ALBUM,"We ALL must agree Aretha was on a Serious Roll during this time...Her Singles were going #1 and/or Top Ten on Billboard, And ALL of her Albums were flying off the shelves! So why not release a Live Album??? Almost every company has done this either too soon or too late. In this case too soon. There was no Unreleased or Never-Heard-Before-Songs (Not even one!), So for those who already had her First Four Atlantic albums wasn't in a hurry to go grab this one. The backing band is so-so, as always her vocals shine throughout....But must of us was waiting for the next Studio Project or even another 'Live' that was worth talking about (Later we got the ""Live At Fillmore West"" project that was worth talking about!!!). So just to add to your collection for the purpose of saying ""I Own It""...get it, but to go the 'Extra mile' looking for it....That's another story."
2,Mostly for fans see review for explanation,"Cousins in his between Strawbs period taking an acoustic approach to a wide range of primarily older Strawbs compositions with Willoughby in lead guitar role. Strawbs and solo fans will not likely be enamoured of this recording the power is lacking in these re-interpretations with one noteable exception. The breathy in your own room vocal of ""I have been my own worst friend"" is an audiophile gem and worth the price of ownership for many fans. Cousins afficianados should really be lobbying A & M for a re-release of ""Two Weeks Last Summer"" featuring Miller Anderson, lead guitar (formerly of Keef Hartley Band, Hemlock, Overdog, Savoy Brown blah blah blah). For a more creditable outing from these two, with the Strawbs supporting, try and find ""Don't Say Goodbye"""
1,Too thin,This sleeping bag is too thin and light. Doesnt look like that in the picture but it is too thin to stay straight as shown in the picture. Not good for outdoors.
1,Not worth the price the printing was too large.,I actually just skimmed through the book but my first reaction was that the words were in too large of a print. Only about 76 pages and this book is over priced. I ended up returning based only on that reason. I do not recommend this book as far as value goes.
2,bad dubbing,"the movie was pretty funny and lee was great, but i was really disappointed in the dubbing and wondered if there was another version (non-dubbed) available."
2,Beginnings,"The first in a series involving a civil war veteran of Andersonville prison is an interesting history lesson of the start of organized police forces, this in Philadelphia. Unfortunately, the author, trying to be fair with the reader, gives too much away, too early. The next installments will be interesting to see."
3,Check the dmentions before you buy,"When I recieved these chairs, I thought they delivered the childrens version. They are very small. The base is 17"" but the seat is only 13"" and the space between the arms is 15"". Anyone over 180 lbs will not be comfortable. Even smaller people will tend to slide out of it."
5,30 years on and still rockin',"I first had this album about 30 years ago. I loved it, as I did all Ry Cooder's albums. It was stolen in waht I termed "" The Great CD and Cassette(!) Robbery of 2000.I re bought it a few weeks ago and found that the music had lost none of it's rythm, it's magic and fabulous sound.A true Oldie, but still a Goodie."
2,don't order from these sellers,"very poor recording, music too low, again tried it on 3 different systems. also, it's missing one of the songs that's advertised on the cover? that's never happened before."
3,Mixed Feelings,"Saw Ry Cooder on the PBS station with Buena Vista Social Club, bought this album expecting something I didn't get. It's ok, I guess I just don't get Ry Cooder"
4,Developing a Modern Reading Program,"Matching Books to Readers is a time saver for teachers who are trying to combine the selection process of whole language with the need for students to have phonetically protected texts. There is theory here, but there is also practicality. It provides suggestions for a range of book in a classroom library so that the needs of all students are addressed. Perhaps one of its best features is the leveling of children books in the appendix. This can be used by the teacher to order (names and addresses of publishers are provided) or to provide books for students based on a variety of levels. It is a good companion for Guided Reading. I would reccomend it for any teacher who is trying to develop a balanced reading/writing program"
2,Leveling Readers for Your Students,"Fontas and Pinnell attempt to assist us in leveling our classroom libraries so we can better service our students. However, with so many different publishers out there, and each having their own way of leveling, I'm not so sure this book is much of a help. I tackled my classroom library and was only able to level 5% of my books using this as a reference. For the money, I'd have been better off buying more books for my students."
5,Very useful for teachers,"If you are a teacher in the primary grades this book is for you. If you are working on putting together a literacy program for your school or classroom this book will be very helpful for you. It has a lot of ideas on literacy including setting up literacy stations and my personal favorite, leveling books. This is a comprehensive guide on leveling books."
5,helpful for choosing grade level books,"our district uses the fountas system for determining if a student is a grade level & this was helpful for getting a sense of where they were & where they were going. great for making sure the books we were asking them to read at home over break were appropriate & for reading aloud books that they would be expected to read in a year or so. the groups of 50, 100, 200 frequent words this system also uses were online, good for flashcards."
2,"Started Great, Finished Bad!","Bought this Staple Gun from Home Improvement Super Store about 6 months ago. Worked great, smooth action and easy operation. Unfortunately it didn't last. About a month ago it started acting up. Now it is hit and miss, doesn't shoot anymore. Have to reload and maybe get one out before it jams. Another Aluminum construction Stapler. Made in China...Go Figure.Would not recommend this one unless you feel like throwing away $30 every 6 months!"
1,Not happy,"THIS staple gun is a piece of crap. It constantly jams using 1/4"" staples on insulation. It will staple 5 or 6 staples then nothing comes out. I usually have to pull the slide out and pull the trigger 5 or 6 more times to get a staple out. I just bought another one made by Arrow, hope it's a better tool."
1,An absolute piece of junk,Grabbed this stapler for the first time because I had an inspector coming and needed to get some insulation installed ASAP. I probably got a staple about every 10 times I pulled the trigger. Avoid this item at all costs... I can't imagine how anyone who spends any time actually stapling things is able to use this.
3,Still need alot of strength or presure to trigger the staple,"Disappointed with how hard it is to staple upside down or in a corner or spot where you don't have enough leverage.No excuse for this folks, been around a long while, should be much much easier.This is just slightly better than my 20 year old staple gun."
1,Stanley staples did not fit and broke gun.,"When loading the staples and trying to close the loading bar, the Stanley staples did not move and ended up throwing a spring. This unit is now worthless! You would think a company like Stanley would have and easy loading sytem, but it is not. Also the Stanley staples should fit in the Stanley gun, but they did not. I will not purchase another Stanley tool again."
5,"Reliable, lightweight, easy reloading","I use this at work for stapling insulation, plastic sheeting, radiant barriers, etc., and have used thousands of staples with it. I only recall one jam ever, which was easy to clear. This stapler is also lightweight and very quick and easy to reload. Like any stapler I've used it takes a lot of force to squeeze the handle, and after stapling all day my hand does get tired, but this one seems easier to use than others. The construction feels very solid and it seems very durable. I highly recommend this if you want a reliable, lightweight, and easy to load stapler."
5,IMHO: Underated By Reviews,"I've had my Sharp Shooter Plus for a short time but after more than 2000 staples it has not jammed. If you use the manufacture recommended staples and brads you may not have a jamming problem. The manufacture recommends Stanley TRA 700 series or Arrow T50 staples.You can easily adjust the force of the brad nailer/staple gun with high/low adjustments. It also accomodates brads to 5/8 inch and staples to 9/16. It's solidly made and has a good balance in your hands. Mine is actually yellow in color which make it easier to find. There's also a cable/wire guide to assist you in stapling down cables/wires.I (highly) recommend this tool for your tool box. Uses would apply to screens, signs, upholstery, insulation strips, holiday lights, cables/audio/wiring systems, framing, canvas art, radiant barriers etc. I am an avid DIY'r."
2,Dont care for this,"I bought this item based on reviews from here, but unfortunately havent even used it yet. Finding the right staples is one problem right off the bat. Then being able to figure out exactly how it should work, which normally would be obvious, isnt as obvious with this thing. Part of the problem is with the poor instructions, which simply dont illuminate my question asking. Just disappointed at this time, if i had a bigger need for this item i would have already gone to a store and bought another stapler that would do the job. I cant recommend this thing to anyone, though..."
1,I feel stolen,"I bought a stanley TR250, and it is only works few times. I lost my money. This staplegun must be out of the market. It is an abuse against customer. And the Owner of the brand have to go to jail"
5,Great value,"I needed a cheap staple gun for one project - recovering some cat scratching posts. This worked great. It took some strength to squeeze the trigger, but my daddy taught me to be tough. :O)"
4,Pretty Good at the price point.,I used it to staple some upholstry and it worked great. I would recommend this product.
1,Totally Useless,"Never before have I had a tool that I hated so much. The inefficiency of this stapler ought to make the Stanley Corporation designers ashamed. I was lucky to get two, maybe three staples in a row working (pinning light fabric to light board). Today, I timed how long it took to try and get any sequence of staples to emerge or stick - forty-five minutes to get 12 staples set; I gave up and used Sobo. I'm unlikely to buy another Stanley product. Do I have to give my review a star? Is there a ""minus-stars"" rating? If so, this is Minus 5 - or Minus 10 - or Minus whatever..."
2,"if you are reading this, go for a pneumatic stapler instead","I really wanted to like this stapler. This was my second Stanley stapler and this one was an upgraded model. I was sure my first one was just bad luck--died on me after a few short projects. So I got this one which by the reviews seemed like the ""Cadillac"" of staplers. I gave it two stars because this stapler did last through the first and only project I put it through. I made a big 3 bin compost pit and the stapler made it though that big project but then I pulled it out for something small and it refused to fire. I think an internal spring had busted, same issue that I suspected in my first Stanley. I then went looking for something completely different--and I found the Surebonder 9600 Pneumatic Narrow Crown Stapler and I have never looked back. It takes the same size (standard T50) staples. The Surebonder is amazing, go search for it right now and get off this Stanley page right now."
1,Service was great!,Never got the product...it was to arrive on the 12th...so I called on the 12th and it was a great experience. A real person answered the phone after 2 rings and refunded my money immediately also sent a voucher ($20.) toward future purchase and a free shipping label in the event that the product came and needed to be returned. The Seller was Discount Vitamins. They understand the meaning of CUSTOMER SERVICE!
1,Snake oil for sale,Our family doctor told me that a bottle of whisky is a better flu remedy than any of this homeopathic mumbo-jumbo. He recommended a yearly flu shot as the best preventative. At least a flu shot has some science behind it...
4,Oscillococcinum works for me,"I've used this stuff several times now, and it really seemed to knock the symptoms down pretty rapidly. It may be ""snake oil"" and the placebo effect; but I'm pretty skeptical, and it has appeared to help me bypass the worst of the illness and get better quickly...One of the previous reviewers knocks it, saying it is so dilute it couldn't work, and that it's just ""duck liver and heart."" Actually, the ""goo"" he talks about is probably full of bacteria, and according to one reference I found, the dose provides enough bacteria to somehow be beneficial.There are also two double blind studies (though financed by the mfr) that show significant improvement over a placebo."
3,"Works great, ultra convenient","I've wanted one of these for many years and then I needed one for a recipe and decided to buy one. It works great and is very convenient. I like the fact that you can store the used oil right in the unit and then put the entire thing into the refrigerator. I made homemade donuts which were cooked perfectly. I just got it so that the only thing that I have made so far, but am looking forward to using it more often.I definitely recommend the GranPappy!"
4,Presto GranPappy,"This is an outstanding value for a deep fryer that makes fried foods, especially french fries, (my grandkids favourite) quick and easy to cook any time of the day! I have owned other deep fryers, but after purchasing this one at Amazon.com, I would never try another brand again."
3,Deep Fryer,"I don't deep fry food, but I bought this for a friend who does. She seems very satisfied with the cooker, and I feel more confident of her safety when she cooks with it, because she was previously frying on the stove top with a pan full of oil. That was my purpose in buying the fryer."
4,frying everything i can get my hands on,"This was my first fryer, so I was very nervous...turns out, it's very user friendly and the food comes out perfectly. I do wish it had a cover to use when frying because there was a fine mist of grease for a foot and a half around my counter and surrounding walls and cabinets (I now line the area with newspapers). Also, heads up, the outside gets insanely hot...I wasn't expecting that when I went to move the thing over a little. I wouldn't say it holds quite as much as some of the reviewers have commented - maybe I'm still nervous about overfilling it.All in all, though, besides covering everything around it with newspaper (which isn't really that big a deal), I'm very, very happy with the fryer. I read A TON of reviews and for the price, this one got by far the consistently best reviews. Not good for my diet, though!"
5,GranPappy works great!,"GranPappy is a great add to my kitchen; I'd been contemplating purchasing a more standard deep fryer, but finally decided to get this one. It works great, heats up quickly, it's easy to clean (!!!), as there are no additional parts to take out. You can't cover it with the lid it comes with (it's plastic), so you may want to cook outside (if possible), but it works great either way. I would recommend this item."
5,GranPappy Deep Fryer,I have gone thru several deep fryers after 37 years of marriage. Several years ago when the covered { while your food cooks } came out I needed a new deep fryer. I bought one & hated it. I was so glad that I was still able to purchase another what I call the old fashioned deep fryer. My deep fried shrimp which has always been great tasted even better.
2,overheats. worthless for anything but chicken and not even good for that,"I bought this thing thinking believing others that the auto temp setting was smart. It is most certainly not. I use the recommended amount of oil and then I watch the temp creep all the way up just under 410. I've used three thermometers just to be sure.Then even after putting in almost 3lbs of chicken the temp drops a bit but very quickly jumps right back up to 400. Everything burns in this thing unless you watch it. It gets so hot that the oil winds up being trashed after one use.I've called Presto about it and their only response is that ""the oil temp will top out at 385"".The only way to work with this thing is to keep plugging and unplugging it to try to keep the temp near 350.And if you want to fry fish or shrimp then you better be very quick on plug work.Very disappointed in this thing."
2,Disappointed,"I am disappointed with the cooking results of my new Presto GrandPappy deep fryer. With several trials attempting to deep-fry chicken, the results were unsatisfactory. Using chicken at room temperature, breading it, and slipping it into the GrandPappy, I found that when the coating reached a pleasing golden brown, the meat was not thoroughly cooked. When leaving the chicken in the pot long enough to be done, the breading burned--not at all tasty.The GrandPappy is a plug-and-play product without temperature control. The oil gets very hot, too hot. My candy thermometer revealed the oil temperature resides at 380 degrees. The recommended oil temperature for deep frying chicken is 365 degrees, explaining why the outside of the chicken is done well in advance of the inside.I would not recommend this product."
3,It's ok,"It has worked fine; would like to have some kind of a basket that fit the container, to bring out all the fries at one time. The lid was destroyed by my son-in-law when he placed the lid on the fryer when the fryer was hot.. ub"
4,GranPappy Deep Fryer,"Presto 05420 FryDaddy Electric Deep FryerI love this deep fryer. This is the second one I have had. This size deep fryer used to be called the FryDaddy. The only difference I have noticed is how the electrical cord is attached to the deep fryer. It is attached with a magnet, which is unusual. You really have to look at the connection in order to hook it up."
5,gave as gift,gave as gift--recipient loved it--thinking of getting one for myself to replace my old fry baby..good size and capacity for us
3,Really needs a basket,This is a compact fryer with good results. I use a sauce pan glass lid instead of the plastic one it comes with. It fits perfectly. Now i am seeking a compatable frying basket. Wish me luck because i do not think Presto even makes one for it.
4,Presto GranPappy,"Really like it! I sort of miss the basket that I had with my previous fryer, but the GranPappy does seem to cook very evenly and quite a bit at a time."
3,Consider this?,http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00006IUWH/qid=1115308005/sr=1-41/ref=sr_1_41/104-4854039-9746300?v=glance&s;=kitchenPresto 06000 Kitchen Kettle Multi-CookerWhich is.. Presto 06000 Kitchen Kettle Multi-Cooker Currently (...). ...at this site..Amazon.I will order it as it gets rave reviews and is multi use. I will report when I get it.My rating above is not applicable..for obvious reasons.For first time shoppers...I have ordered many items from Amazon and I have never been disappointed. Good prices...good service.Thank you Amazon and JB.
5,Great Product!,This is my second one the first lasted about 17 yrs. I am very happy with the new one. Would recommend this product to anyone with a house hold of 4 or less people.
2,Not too hot,We had a granpappy fryer for 25 years & wore it out. This new one did not heat up to frying temperature - perhaps we just had a dud. They sure don't build em like they used to.
5,Recommend,I would recommend this unit oil size six cups is a perfect and the oil gets really hot reheats fast no need to wait for batchesnice and wide
3,no controls,"I could just as easily use a pot on my electric range! There is no thermostat control for temperature regulation. And the product literature warns against using animal fats because the temperature could get too high. I use lard for a lot of frying, so this is obviously not a keeper. Returning it next week."
4,Good basic fryer!!,"This is an excellent basic fryer, and longstanding excellent track record from a company you can trust. This cooks enough to feed several people, and it does it evenly, and relatively fast. Sure, it's no health food, but it is nice for a change of pace once in a while. Does great with fish, shrimp, french fries, chicken strips, ect... Only down side is that unlike newer units, this does not have a lid that closes while cooking, which would prevent the occasional splash. Great unit, you should like it also."
4,Deep Fryer,"I've had one of these for years. One improvement is the magnetized cord attachment. Otherwise, it's the same good 'ole reliable deep fryer....much more efficient than a skillet wth much less fuss and splatters."
2,not very happy,"The fryer is exactly as pictured and works, but I didn't realize there was no temperature dial! So I used a thermometer and had to keep unplugging when the temp was not correct for my cooking. I can do this but would never recommend this product. Sincerely, Betty"
5,Grandson's first apartment,Amazon was the only place I could find this appliance for my Grandson to fry in. He is well pleased with the product and the delivery and service was exceptional as always.
5,This is great,I have used one of these for years never had a problem with it. I just got one for my son.
5,Love my GranPappy Fryer!,"We had one of these when I was growing up, but it was called the Fry Daddy. This one is really great, it heats quickly and holds the temperature nicely! Great for that occasional deep fried goodie."
3,Presto GranPappy Electric Deep Fryer,"I like the fact that the product is compact and simple. However, I had difficulty attaching the power plug and it gets disconnected very easily. Without a temperature control, the oil gets too hot after a while. The lid was warped upon unpacking the unit. I do not recommend a fryer without temperature control."
4,"Large, stable, and does its job with no frills or excuses","I've used this deep fryer to cook up things of all varieties: wings, turnovers, fries, battered vegetables and fish. It's taken all of them with ease and produced delicious cooked products. The fryer has a large enough volume to put in 8 chicken wing pieces or a smallish to medium sized potato worth of fries at a time comfortably if you stagger putting them in. It gets up to cooking temperature quickly and seems to do a perfectly fine job at maintaining it.Unfortunately, there are no options for temperature or indication that the desired temperature has been reached. This makes it so that foods that benefit from cooking at multiple or extreme temperatures like fries and wings are hard to get perfect. That said, the temperature that it's set to sit at is perfectly suitable for all general purpose deep frying."
3,Cultural Foundations,"Book was used. It was a little worn, but it will serve its purpose. I will more than likely use the service again."
1,"LOVE POEMS? LOVE, SICK IN THREE-QUARTERS TIME","This ""poems"" in this thin volume are actually love songs ..,. such popular ditties as ""I Honestly Love You,"" ""Sometimes When We Touch,"" ""Take My Breath Away,"" ""Islands in the Stream,"" ""Like a Virgin"" and ""Hooked on a Feeling."" What a gimmick. What a rip-off. The performers who sang the songs are credited (the actual composers and lyricists are listed in the back of the book), presumably because names like ""Madonna"" and ""Olivia Newton-John"" are much familiar (and more marketable) than ""Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly"" and ""Stephen Kipner and Terry Shaddick."" Hot stuff? Please. Don't make me feel guilty. Even for the hot bloodied, the glory of love featured here is bad medicine. Originality, more than words, is still the one. I can't fight this feeling of ... up-chucking."
4,pretty good,"I think this is a pretty good screensaver, but I wish you could have more fish on the screen and an included shark would be nice (epatulate, bamboo, etc). the goldfish are nice too, but i wish there were more to choose from. otherwise, i think this is an awesome screensaver"
1,Object oriented simulation -> the example how not to,"This book starts with a description of objects and OMT and UML stuff. It explains the benefits of object oriented techniques and of the capabilities of simulation. It takes some pages to explain how simulation languages work and what needs to be included. So far no problem. Untill it starts explaining about a barber shop and PSIM (the simulation language developed in C++ by the author of the book). All kinds of process flows are modelled, not only in the basics of the library elements of the language, but also in the example itself. Unfortunately the whole object oriented technique is neglected. For the object oriented expert a good laughter, for the novice in either OO or simulation, watch out for this book and duck.

1,Not up to my expectations,"I had heard about this movie a few years back and finally decided to purchase it. I'm a huge fan of movies based on true events, as well as old movies. However this movie was such a disappointment. Only the last few minutes of the movie were interesting. I wouldn't recommend this flick to anyone."
1,BR Review,I am really disappointed by the poor transfer of this BR release. There is no need to buy the BR version if you have the DVD.
1,System problem shouldn't be generalized on its people!,"As a Turkish citizen living in US, I agree strongly there are many human rights issues that need to be improved in Turkiye. However I don't think it is fair to generalize to its people the system problem or politics. Some narrow minded people want to be judgemental with Turks just because of this movie, well I would say go ahead and see your own history with human rights, no need to go through detail here."
1,"DEAR ALAN PARKER AND OLIVER STONE,","I have no comment for all the people who think this movie is great or some mere 'exagerration'. It seems as if they do not even know what the word ""ORIENTALISM"" means.However, in case one day, hopefully, Mr.Parker and Mr.Stone care to peruse these pages; I would like to ask them, very sincerely: HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF AN ANTI-SEMITIC FILM BECAME SO FAMOUS?? AND IF YOU DO HAPPEN TO HAVE EVEN THE VAGUEST NOTION OF WHAT ANTI-SEMITISM IS, AND HOW IT WORKS, HOW ARE WE TO BELIEVE THAT YOU COULD NOT HAVE KNOWN, OR HAD ANY NOTION OF, THE EFFECTS OF A FILM LIKE THIS??"
1,Real?,"It does NOT mean that this is a real story just because Billy Hayes says so! Awful film in terms of any aspect. I had lived in Turkey, in many different regions for 30 years. There is nothing 'real' in that film!"
5,Awsome!,"This is one of the most awsome films ever. When finished the viewer is emotionally drained but excited because the hero finally got away. It is horrible even to think what people go through in the notorious Turkish jails even today - last December 2000, 30 prisoners chose to set themselves alight rather than go on. I can understand why. Excellent film with great acting and fascinating plot. No wonder it has collected so many awards. A must for all."
2,I Can't agree with the blu ray picture quality,I liked this film when I first saw it at a movie house long long time ago and then I purchased this blu raybut the picture quality of this blu ray is quite disappointing because I can't find any better picture qualityon this blu ray compared to any other DVDs.
5,Very good,I apologize in advance this isn't really a review of the movie. I just can't believe how frequently older reviews ...
1,Human Rights or Propaganda?,You should see this movie before you come to Turkey. Then maybe you'll think that it's gonna be an adventure to take a vacation here but I am afraid you'll get disappointed. First of all Istanbul is not an ugly city as they try to show in that movie. Secondly neither the law courts and the prisons are like that in Turkey. I don't claim that this movie is based on a whole lie but there's a great exagration we see. Turkey was very different 20 years a go but it has never been a hell as it seems in the movie.
4,"Lighten Up Folks, Its Only A Movie",I have read some of the reviews posted here for this movie and they almost laughable. People need to lighten up a bit and stop being so goddam politically correct. This true life story is a Hollywood dramatization folks. Its purpose is to entertain. And I for one am not ashamed to say that I would watch this movie just to look at Brad Davis in the buff. Nuff Said.
1,FANTASY,"This film is an obvious result of the greek and armenian lobbies in the US. It is simply an anti-propaganda tool against a nation. The political purpose has been achieved. The introduction of all the Turks as monsters have created the mood effects for those who believe or lpretend to believe such a thing is possible, however for those who know the reality, it simply becomes a propaganda fantasy. A film in my opinion should rather have a priority in artistic matters."
2,Story true but with lots of subjective exaggration,"This movie had been forbidden in Turkey many years therefore whenever I heard the influences of Midnight Express I wasn't able to say anything. I didn't even know what was it about. 7 years before somehow, a private channel has showed the movie and I remember that the channel broke a rating record that night. The day after everyone was saying the same thing "" This is bull$h!t!"" Well but I am afraid we were a bit late to protest this Anyway, the image of Turkey has changed in 20 years time but people still afraid of us just because of a movie????"
3,Is this what passes for a hero?,"This is a watchable and disturbing film, but it raises my hackles a bit. Leaving aside the whole ""Is the film racist?"" discussion that taking up so much space I think what bothers me about it is the way Billy Hayes is portrayed as some sort of tragic hero, a misguided youth victimized by a brutal system. For God's sake, he was a drug smuggler! I think the script should have played up on that angle a bit more and we would have had a much more thoughtprovoking film. On the plus side, though, there are some very good performances and the soundtrack is worth hearing."
3,Movie deviates from book,"I feel the movie does some good. It doesn't deny that the main charector was wrong for what he did. Remember, back in 1970, there was a more cavilier attitude towards drugs and he was dealing with the original 4 year prison sentence appropriately. But being beaten, tortured and imprisoned in a foriegn country, with limited contact with family and freinds is going to be traumatic for anyone, and the movie dispays that well.With that said, however, I think the movie deviates WAY too much from the book. The escape first-handedly described in the book is much more fascinating and would have been better to see than the movies deviation. The ommision of some the amnesties to prisoners makes the movie fall short as well.The movie gets the basic point of the book across, but the impact could have been stronger if it just followed the story as laid out by the first hand recollection of it."
2,Don't bother watching this....read the book,"I can't understand how so many people think this is such a great movie.When I first saw it, having read & enjoyed the bookMidnight Express, I waited for the incredibly exciting escape, and then went ""Huh??"" A really thrilling escape story was completely cheapened by the totally bogus ending of this film. Perhaps I'd have liked the film more without reading the book. Some books can be improved when turned into films, such asForest GumporFor Love of the Game, while some, such asQ & A: A Novel(upon which ""Slumdog Millionaire"" was very loosely based) really suffer when they reach the silver screen. This is one that really suffered.Billy Hayes has complained about both the ending, and the strong anti-Turk attitude, but when asked about a remake, he has said ""It's done. Time to move on."""
3,So so movie..But very racist,"This movie is not a bad movie since it is from the hands of Oliver Stone and Alan Parker..But it is very racist. Can you imagine a country where all the individuals are bad people? Not seems logical to me..Exaggerated..A REPLY TO OUR FRIEND TRIANDAFILLOU WHO POSTED A MESSAGE ON FEB.20: REMEMBER YOUR COUNTRY 25 YEARS AGO? HAVE YOU SEEN COSTA GAVRAS' 'MISSING'? HE MADE THAT MOVIE TO PROTEST THE SITUATION IN HIS (AND ALSO YOUR OWN!) COUNTRY.BACK THEN,THERE WERE MANY MISSING AND TORTURE CASES IN GREECE.GO ON AND READ SOME BOOKS ON GREEK NEAR HISTORY.YOU MAY BE SURPRISED AT WHAT YOU WILL SEE!"
1,wrongful depiction,It is a wrongful depiction of Turkey and Turkish people aimed at defamation. I would not recommend it. Do not waste your time watching misleading information.
2,Can Americans really be shocked by that movie knowing about Abou Ghouraib and Quantanamo?,"This movie is quite shocking by the near to complete freedom of prison guards to abuse and torture prisoners. It's probably even more shocking to the US public as an American is the victim as far as drug dealers may be called victims.People suspect of terrorism may due to the actions and regulations of the Bush government face a similar degree of dehumanization. This movie demonstrates the consequences if we allow governments to act as they want, freely and without controll. This concerns both George W. Bush as well as the former Turkey government. The sadistic prison guard could well have been Donald Rumsfeld talking about constructive techniques of interrogation."
3,Overly sensational but well-made prison film,"Based on the true story of would-be drug smuggler Willaim Hayes, screenwriter Oliver Stone goes way over the top here with courtroom theatrics, sensational violence, and an overt chauvanism towards Turks in this portrayal of the Turkish prison system as a kind of hell on earth. On the plus side: great locations (Instanbul and Malta), beautiful photography, and good acting, help create a sense of atmosphere."
5,Turkish paranoia,"This was a great film due to its acting, cinematography, and intense storyline. I am surprised that many reviewers (many of Turkish origin?) have taken on such a defensive stance due to what others may think of the country itself. To me, it is a simple prison movie with universal themes of brutality, lonliness, and remorse. Then again, Turkey is a country that DID commit a Genocide against its Armenian citizens in 1915 and has been roundly condemed for denying it. It's no wonder that unfavorable reviews are on the basis of Turkish paranoia rather than the merits of the movie."
1,Nice try!This is the very stupid and worst film!,"hate this film.and hate all players in this film.this film is full loaded wrong things and lies.Im from Turkey so my country is pretty beatiful and cool!so my country had fallen anarchy in 1978.and Turkey is bad position in this year and after two years.Billy Hayes get a chance! ,cant wait his biography into a film with oliver stone when Turkey is in bad position.! but billy hayes and his friend are mistake.very dissappointing and very stupid film.and no turkish player in this film(all players have very funny turkish!).players like persian or afghan! huh.nice try Billy but your film is very funny and bad.Turkey is freedom country so not even one cant run down my country."
2,not to realistic,"In early seventies life was turbulent the person in real life was actually a drug addict,later died due to AIDS.He did sell his movie wrights and the producer made the movie based on who payed him for appropriate purpose,the movie could be much more quality if any of the charecters were actually Turkish which were notprison not vacation spot,in those years some movies were made about Soviet prisons I have watched when I was kid anybody could tell some scenes were intentionally showed almost Satanic and evil,"
1,"Boaahhh,such a buckshot movie!!!!","All i want to say about this movie is:It's the most stupid and nonsencial film i've ever seen before.Don't attempt to purchase it otherwise you would be regret.More importantly don't struggle with my country by this way, nevermind we're so patient to endurance.NICE TRY Oliver Stone and Alan Parker.!!!But we haven't been impressed...."
3,I didn't like it,"Even though it is a good movie it misleads the people by making false judgments about turkish people. Most of the parts of the Midnight Express weren't shot in Turkey and people as actors and actresses were Greek and Armenian whom are known to hate Turkish people.That's why I didn't like this movie much, because it's about political propaganda which is supported by Armenian and Greek lobbies. Even though it is claimed that this movie is based on a true story, it is not reflecting the real truth."
5,Midnight Express,"This is a fantastic movie. I remember seeing it when it came out in the 70's and it is every bit as good now as it was then. A true story and a very upsetting one until finally Billy Hayes gets out of this turkish prison. He gets caught smuggling drugs and the story from that moment on is unbelievable, intense. A well done movie to put you into the setting and feel for how horrible it was to be stuck in a foreign country without the help of your home country being able to help. A good one even if you have already seen it. Enjoy!!"
3,"Technically Genious,Politically Incorrect","I had heard such praise about this film from critics so I went ahead and bought it second hand. Great acting,good story,good sound,good cinematography, and great music, but...... The first half hour of the film is great movie making. When he tries to smuggle the hashish,gets caught,thrown in prison. As I kept watching I couldn't keep thinking of all the rascism directed towards Turkish people. There's not even one nice Turkish person in the film.In the end I found the film biased, racist, and not even engrossing because honestly,I did not feel sorry for the main character.I heard that half of the factuality in the film was exaggerated and twisted for dramatic effect. I returned the film the next day. Definately one of the most controversial films of all time."
4,Midnight Express,"This was a very good movie to see, even though it was made some time ago. I really enjoyed how survival became the force which gave this person the will to continue, not loose focus on his goal but to escape. If someone is looking to see a true story that will scare you straight, this might be the one to see.I hope who ever watches this movie from my review, that you enjoy this story as much as I did."
4,Very Good Graphics Book,"This book was recommended to me by an architect for reviewing possible material on architecture license examinations. Graphically it's an excellent book. Bigger type letters would make it easier to read. Other than that, it's a great buy!"
4,A Visual Dictionary of Architecture-Ching,"Outstanding visual resource book for Architecture and Construction Management students. Many detailed line drawings and terminology that really helps you understand the many details and concepts used in Architecture. I only wish it had more specific Architectural concept definitions, but well worth the investment anyway."
4,Dark. Dubby. House.,"If you're expecting impeccable track order matched by classy Oaky-style fades, look elsewhere. Smooth trance (a la ""Dark And Long"")? Look elsewhere. This is truly a deep dark house selection. The order is rough at times; for example, a scorcher like ""Barber's Adagio For Strings"" is followed by the mindless ""Toca's Miracle."" It's a bit of a letdown occasionally. The mixing is blunt, and ""Cream Live"" serves best as a selection of hot club tracks; which it does quite bloody well, thank you very much."
3,Not as expected,"Honestly, i might have expected too much of this cd. It has a few good tracks, but nothing compared to Cream Anthems 2000. Maybe, cause 2000 is no more the year of trance(as predicted), as 99 was....we are gonna see more of progressive house. This cd is a blend of both, but tracks like Heart Of Asia, Natural Blues, etc. make this cd worth listening."
4,Great taste of Euro House,"This is an excellent mix if you are looking for strictly house/trance. There is a bit of variety in tracks at the beginning of CD 1 with Chicane and ATB, that sets them apart from the rest of the tracks on the CD. But you'll learn to love it. This is a CD you just throw on and let it run it's course."
3,Loved it 5 times,"After about 5 washes, the front logo faded dramatically. I love the brand and it's hard to find in the USA, but sheesh, I wish the logo was embroidered. The decal didn't last long."
4,excellent book for any player,book came on time and in great shape ....excellent book .for any guitar playerthis is my third copy and it makes a great gift....mw
4,A Room Without A View,"An intense film that keeps you glued to the set. Top notch entertainment that should please everyone who watches it. I loved the performance of Jodie Foster and her androgenous daughter. They both did an excellent job. I also really enjoyed Jared Leto's performance. He played an intense character with alot of passion for crime and I loved the braids. Another standout was the ending, totally gripping and traumatic and everyone ends up getting what they deserve. If you can't do the time don't do the crime."
1,"Oh, please...","Fincher was so bored with this one he moved a camera through the handle of a coffee pot. Overacting, dopey burglars, stupid situations, complete lack of character development makes this a dark version of Home Alone. Not even the first Home Alone...the third one. Shame on you, Jodie."
1,"Boring, slow, boring, boring","This movie was a yawn-fest. Not suspenseful, not intense, not anything but a waste of time. Do not waste your money on it and advise your friends to do the same."
1,it's a dog!,"Should be 45 minutes shorter, and would be more believable if the characters weren't such fools. Screen an old Hitchcock film instead."
2,"This is only worth renting, not purchasing.","We watched this movie last night and found ourselves thinking it was pretty ridiculous towards the middle and end. It was barely worth renting, let alone purchasing.Jodie Foster is a great actress, but we wondered why she chose this movie."
3,A simple plot,"Being a huge Fincher admirer, this movie was bit of a dissappointment. The most noticeable aspect of his previous movies(seven, fightclub) is the unpredictability of the conclusion, but panic room has more of a run-of-the mill finish. There's only so much excitement that can be packed in this story which centers around a room and 5 characters. Music is not impressive either with gloomy scenes it seems like something is gonna happen but nothing does. All in all panic room is not david fincher like he is, but it sure does manage to hold your attention long enough for you not to feel ripped off."
2,Disappointing,The movie starts interesting but but a couple of mistakes make it sense-less. I was very disappointed. Do not buy. My advice is rent it. That way you will only spend (...) instead of (...) on a movie you probably won't care to see again.
3,Foster returns to comedy!,"That was the hardest I've laughed in a long time!Far from being ""riveting,"" this movie was so completely predictable that I couldn't stop laughing. You know it's bad when you can turn to your movie-watching buddy and say, ""Doorbell!"" just before it rings... So please, take advantage of the chance to watch Jodie Foster's great non-thriller, but save yourself the few rental dollars and get this from the LIBRARY."
1,Sleeping Room,I didn't find this movie scarry at all. I expected real panic here but it didn't really do anything for me at all. I got all hyped up to watch it and really be scarred but it got more boring each minute I watched it. OOOOHHH bad guys break into the house I am really frightened there. I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it yet but I found it very lacking on the frightening side.
3,"C'mon Jodie, ain't it a bit much?","I have always admired Jodie Forster's acting and her choice in films. This is a good thriller, hence the 3 stars. Where it lost me was all the overwhelming gratuitous violence among those who broke into the house. The tenderhearted Forest Whittaker was way out of place here. Jodie's character definitely did not miss her marriage. Her character took out hostilities on the three who broke in. All of them. There's fighting and there's fighting and while I love zany gore films like Army of Darkness, the cruelty displayed in this film left a sick feeling in my stomach. Just too much for me."
4,foster is very good!,"jodie foster is just great in this ,mobvie and so is the kid playing her son. i relalyy liked this flcik i thought it was almost better than Men in black. panic room is a flcik the public is giving a bit two much credit to but that's okay cause it's a good fun action paked flcik that will plaeas4ed evceryone.....keep it real!"
5,kept me hooked!!,this movie was soo suspenseful! i kept waiting 2 see what would happen next and jumping out of my chair! its a pretty good movie u should watch it
1,simply God-awful,"What a waste of an accomplished actress in Jodie Foster... None of the characters were particularly believable, and all of them were ridiculously predictable. The same could be said for this film; just by-the-numbers, lowest-common-denominator Hollywood pulp. It might also help if the actress who plays Foster's daughter had an actual pulse, too.Can't believe this is the same Fincher who made ""Fight Club."" What happened, has he had a lobotomy recently?"
2,Nothing good to say except it ended.,This movie was terrible. I watched it because I really like Jodie Foster films but this one really was awful. The characters were uninteristering and the film lacked a plot. It starts off well with the mother and daughter looking for a new house and being shown the 'panic room'. It's just not a good movie.
3,Ghost Dog Meets Clarice Starling...,"...I wanted something a little more provocative seeing that Director Finscher just came off the triumph of Fight Club to do this. This is a stylish, moody movie in its own right. And the way the two ladies holed up in the panic room hold off the bad guys will keep you entertained for the duration of the movie. Whittaker comes off ultimately as a benevolent bad guy. Jodie is believable as a single mom trying to protect her offspring ala Little Man Tate. But alas, good acting and a hot director could not save this thriller from the throes of predictability. Movies like this one will occupy your time and attention and you will enjoy it, but don't ask for more than that..."
5,No Panic - It's a great movie,"In her first role since 1999's Anna and the King, Jodie Foster is simply wonderful as Meg Altman in this one heck of a thriller movie, PANIC ROOM! In this film there is little time to establish any since of normality, until the action breaks with a tag-team of three robbers breaking into Meg's new four story 4,200sq foot NYC brownstone. Meg, of course immedently wakes her daughter and they run to the Panic Room, a fortified fortress, within her castle of a home! From her station in the Panic Room, Meg, though the use of cameras commissions a standoff with the robbers, them all the time trying to get into the Panic Room, with Meg trying all the time to contact the outside world to help her get out of the Panic Room. This makes for some very intersting situations when you inject a diabetic daughter, a caring ex-husband, dazzling visual effects, a fearless robber, a money -hungery robber and another with heart of gold! This is a film not to be missed!"
3,Movie was good but DVD disc lacking in features,"I enjoyed watching the movie (despite the weak ending), but I was sorely disappointed in the lack of features on the DVD disc. ... the only ""extras"" on the disc was a filmography. ..."
2,Panic Room DVD release : review,"this is one stripped-down DVD: no director's commentary, no special features of note. no ""making of"", no sfx reel, no deleted scenes. Basically, you get ... the movie. Ok, you get one of the trailers. Disappointing after the lavish ""Fight Club"" double DVD."
2,"Great Movie, Pointless DVD","I have been a fan of DVDs since they came out. Almost every DVD you buy has some sort of special feature, directors commentary, or something. This Panic Room ""SuperBit"" DVD has nothing! I Loved the movie and have been looking forward to the DVD release for months. I just dropped almost [$$$] on it and i know that in a couple months they are probably going to release another DVD of panic room that is the SPECIAL COLLECTORS EDITION. Just another way for them to make more and more money. My advise, dont waste your money on this, wait till a better version comes out. But make sure you see the movie at some point!"
3,Not too scary,"I scare easily, and this movie didn't scare me at all. It was a cool plot, but the Panic Room could have been used better. There was too much banter with the bad guys. When Jodie Foster's character went into protection mode and rigged the house, you couldn't really tell what she was doing. I was hoping that she was at least rigging it up as good as they did in Home Alone. Wait for the video."
4,Much better than I thought it would be...,"*PANIC ROOM (superbit-single disc)*I thought Panic Room was going to be boring and not worth the time. On the contrary, it was quite entertaining. I couldn't imagine how they would fill an hour and a half of being stuck in a panic room shelter hiding from the bad guys. Turns out the movie is about 20 minutes longer than that. There are a few twists and turns that keep it very interesting. The hook is a clever story line of a criminal and his struggle to do right when he's doing wrong. Also, the strength of a parent when their childs life is in danger. It leaves you with a good feeling and I can appreciate that.I absolutely loved the camera work. Some of the neatest camera pans you'll ever see in a movie are in Panic Room. A little too much cursing but, it's almost expected with thud criminals to speak at that level, it's understandable but there's a lot of it.Very well done. Better than I expected."
2,Goes Downhill Halfway Through and Awful Ending,"The movie was sort of interesting, with a lot of little plot twists--until it was about three-quartes through. Then it got really stupid, contrived, and of course, politically correct. Jodie Foster does a number of really stupid and non-realistic things--like not telling the police there's a problem. Afterall, the thugs holding her daughter can't hear what she's saying. And then, not taking the damn gun herself and shooting. Finally, if I see one more ""dead man rising back to life"" in any movie, I think I will throw up. Raoul, who already has a bashed arm and is bleeding quite badly, is smashed over the head with a sledge hammer. That would be enough to do any mortal in. But no, he pops up back to life, full of vim and vigor...well, I wish they might have put a realistic ending on it."
2,Unrealistic and Flawed Plot,"The only good thing about this DVD is the acting of Jodie Foster. This DVD is a true bomb. The kid acts fairly well, but the rest of the cast borderlines on camp. There are just too many incidents when Jodie Foster could have taken more realistic measures to save herself and her family, but instead chose to do something stupid, like not to seek help outside, not to use the gun herself and not inform the police when opportunity prevailed.Some suspense and clever camerawork, but mostly predictable. This suspense drama proves to be almost comical and ridiculous to the point of frustration. The almost 2 hours could have been cut in half and this would still bomb."
2,Predictable,"Jodie Foster, as usual, is terrific and the only reason to watch. She just needs meatier roles. This one is very predictable from the moment she and her daughter tour the place. I wish, just once, this type of movie would go off in another direction but, of course, it does not. The perpertrators are so bland and typical that I was thinking of the thugs in ""Home Alone"" trying to be serious. Did not recognize Dwight Yokum. The dialog and circumstances have been seen many times before and with much better results. If you have nothing else to watch, then do so. Otherwise, do not confine yourself to the same old thing."
5,GREAT movie.,I love love love this movie. It is very suspenseful and I love the twists and turns. Jodie foster is amazing in this one. I highly recommend it to those who like suspenseful thrillers.
1,BORING & ABSURD,"WHAT HAPPENED TO MY BELOVED JODIE???? THIS MOVIE IS BY FAR HER WORST ONE... ONLY ENTERTAINING IF YOU'RE ABLE NOT TO THINK [NOT EVEN SLIGHTLY] ABOUT THE PLOT... IF YOU DO YOU WILL FIND IT ILLOGICAL AND FULL OF GAPS.I MEAN WHO CAN SPEND THOUSANDS OF BUCKS BUILDING A ""HOME BUNKER"" AND FORGETS TO PUT A POLICE SIREN, OR AT LEAST A CELL PHONE???]"
2,A fail considering the talent of Fincher!,"Did David Fincher need to demonstrate us he is a promise director and gifted of multiple skills and deep creativity and making us to waste our time and money in a boring film like this one?May be there was something hidden that I didn't watch ; but I think that the trilogy Forrest Whitaker , Jodie Foster and David Fincher was a safe garantee.Wrong choice!The result is just a technically and superb work ; but without a credibble plot ; if the secret intention of Fibcher was to make a homagge to those horror films of the fifties ; then I beg your pardon .But if not ..."
4,Fincher Did A Fine Job.,"When I first heard about what the plot for this film was going to be before I had seen it, I was worried. After seeing it I was very impressed. Not only with some of the best direction I've ever seen, but by some great acting by a great cast. This is a movie that I would love to see in a Special Edition other than the Superbit release in the near future. The special effects blend in perfectly in the film rather than detract from it. Even though the film only takes place in one building on one day, there is a fair amount of story to be told. This is a great film by a great director. If you loved this film, you should see: Fight Club, SE7EN & The Game."
3,My least favorite Fincher,"It is probably too much to ask that Fincher follow ""Fight Club"" with an equally groundbreaking piece of cinema. This film has plenty of thrills for your average movie-goer, the same person who will no doubt be impressed that the camera goes inside a keyhole and comes back out. But for those who value a higher level of story and technique, this film is not worth owning over other Fincher-helmed projects as ""Se7en"" or ""Fight Club,"" both of which are available in excellent two-disc special editions."
5,Fincher + Foster = Good movie !!!!,"Jodie Foster did an incredible job in this movie and kudos to her and Kristen Stewart who played her daughter. I don't want to give anything away about the movie but it was definitley one that I would recommend to my friends, male and female alike.I was sitting on the edge of my theater chair during a large portion of the end. Forrest Whitaker also did an excellent job in his role as bad/good guy. You wanted to feel sorry for him but he just wouldn't do the right thing... And David Fincher (his best movie is Fight Club) is a master of illusion. Great camera working.Anyway, don't take my word for it, go see it. I don't think you'll regret it."
3,it could have been a contender!,"I really wanted to love this movie as much as I did Fight Club and Se7en, but beneath the great directing and decent acting you'll just be amazed at how little there actually is to this movie. Aside from a handful of odd character traits, this seems like a cookie-cutter action/drama, and not much else to it. Great taste, less filling. As I said, I am a fan of David Fincher, but I gotta say this is not how I would have followed up Fight Club."
1,"Wow, the bad way","Okay Fight Club was brilliant, but key difference is it had a script, a good premise. Panic Room Philosophy: Home Alone, but not funny!!! ""lets make a movie about claustrophobia!."" No no. Im sorry but amazing cinematography (The likes of M. Night Shalamayan, Mothman-esque) and teriffic CGI compound camera shots cannot make up for the horrendeous lack of plot. The performances by the actors are all good, but really what the... are they doing in this film. The characters are all overly clever in a bad way and act as if the audience cared about watching them. MY friend observed: they could cut to a football game in the middle and no one would notice. The audience didnt know about or car about the dialogue. What a poor film for david fincher to make. Boo."
4,This movie is fun to watch.,It has interesting plot. Superbit Collection is right that its film is very high quality. I like how these people act in the movie. They did a good job.
3,Panic by the buckett full,Thrilling mixed with panic attack. By superb acting with dashing terror in your new home. Another classic for the colection of DVDs. A must watch movie.
2,Over-hyped.,"Panic Room starring Jodie Foster and Kristen Stewart is a major disappointment. Probably David Fincher's most inconsistent film to date. All the actors are good in this but it's too long and boring. Jared Leto and Forest Whitaker look completely horrible, jeez who was in charge of hair and make-up? Panic Room is the biggest disaster of 2002."
5,Panic Room,"This was not the quite ""Thriller, edge of your seat"" movie they hyped about. But I admit it kept me interested throughout the entire movie.It was fantastic. I thought Jodie was excellent. She played the victim but you could never tell by the way she portrayed the new homeowner being burglarized during her first night. Her daughter, wonderfully done by Kristen Stewart, seemed to have a sexual identity problem. Apparently whoever decided to give Jodie a daughter, must have had a son in mind.Dwight Yokum was evil beyond description except when he got caught in the Panic Room.This was one helluva good movie. I higjly recommend it to all Jodie Foster fans."
3,If it wasn't for Foster...,"If it wasn't for a more recognized name like Jodie Foster, I probably wouldn't have bothered to watch this movie. Sceptical, I viewed this movie to be entertained with some of the action of a hunted down pair innocent of wrong doing and misunderstanding. The story lacks a bit of creativity and has basically half-witted criminals trying to get inside a secret room in the house that contains bonds worth a fortune. The exploding propane gas-scene was probably the best, though this movie didn't seem to have enough action as there were very little scenes. With little scenes I would have preferred more drama and acting, but that didn't come through enough for me. Is this a great Jodie Foster movie? No, there has been better that she has done, but has some good suspense which makes it interesting at times. 3 Stars!"
4,PANIC INDEED!,"A very tense thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat through out! It does go a little over board towards the end,but it is still a first rate thriller. The superbit version I have, did not impress me any more or less than a standard DVD release."
5,"Really nice movie, it's not scary, but it's entertaining","I don't know if this movie was supposed to be scary or something....anyway, I bought this for $4 at a sale, and I had no idea if this movie was good or bad or what had critics said about it. Anyway I bought it and I was really pleased with my purchase.It's a very entertaining movie and the story is original and fun. It's something that could happen to any of us and it's fun to see how this family comfronts it.It's not gonna scare you, it won't make you jump off of your seat, but it'll let you have such a great time. I recommend this movie to people who like mystery and thriller movies.5 stars."
3,Okay movie,It was a good movie but I would have rather the movie be shown as them hiding out in the panic room unknown to the robbers and trying to get a phone and the theives come upon the idea that someone else is in the house.
1,Camera work gets the star....,"Everyone by now knows the premise of this story. It's a sure ""hook"" to get the customer in. The camera work is creative and almost distracts the viewer from the story which doesn't matter since there is really no plot to follow. Kristen Stewart is quite good but for the life of me I cannot understand why Jodie Foster gets all the accolades. She is one of the most wooden actors in films. Check the dialogue at the front door. She's so bad I cringed. Her voice never rises above a monotone in all her movies and less is better does not fit this story. Her screaming scene isn't even effective or believable. In closing, this movie is a big bore and I resent the money I put out to see it."
2,Lame....,"Man, this was dissapointing. My feelings can't be described using words. This is definitely one of the most dissapointing movies I've ever seen(and I've seen a lot of crap). Jodie Foster shouldn't waste her talent on such a movie like ""Panic Room""."
1,HOME ALONE,"Take the movie HOME ALONE and replace Macaulay Culkin with Jodie Foster and you get PANIC ROOM. This movie is so riddled with plot holes and unrealistic behavior from the characters that it quickly turns into a bad comedy. In fact, I found Joe Pesci to be more menacing in HOME ALONE then I did the three bumbling clowns who torment Jodie Foster in this non-thriller.Jodie, please, you're a great actress. But your last couple of movies were complete duds. Do yourself a favor and pick some better scripts girl. You're striking out."
3,Better than I expected!,"I originally had no desire to see this. I thought the idea of Jodie Foster being locked in a room for 2 hours wasn't going to be very interesting.Turns out I was wrong. This movie is actually very good! It's very suspenseful and has some great action sequences in it.Plus, as always, Jodie Foster does a great job. I've been a fan of hers ever since she starred in the Pippi Longstocking movies."
4,Very solid and good film,"Jodie Foster stars in this amazing thriller from director David Fincher (the director of Fight Club and Seven). Foster plays a divorced mother living with her daughter and they move into a large mansion in New York. But, unfortunately, while there, 3 robbers invade the house, as they didn't know that anyone was moved into the house. Foster's character and her daughter hide themselves in a ""panic room"", which no one else can get in after the door is closed because the door is so heavily reinforced. But, what the robbers want is in that room, so they will do everything possible to get in. It's a good thriller with some very suspensful moments, but if you're looking for lots of scares, this probably isn't it. It has some funny moments and some great action scenes that are memorable. Foster acts great in the film as does Forest Whitaker, who plays one of the robbers. Highly reccomended."
2,Great move. BAD DVD RECORDING.,"The movie is one of the best I have ever seen, but the movie was recorded badly because my Toshiba SD-3006 DVD player could not play the entire movie. It continues to stall in the switch layer change. The recording studio should do a better job for recording two-layer disc movies. Every other DVD movies play fine in my DVD player. Not sure if every other new DVD players stall in the switch-layer change for viewing Panic Room.So, I switch to the next chapter of Panic Room and rewind it a little, and I could finish the entire file without any problems at all.Walter Chan"
3,It's not what I was expecting,"When I watched the trailer for this movie I imagined something really scarey and due to the blue flame shot in the trailer I expected something supernatural by the end of the movie. Nothing of the sort. As far as thrillers go, it starts out fairly strong then in my oppinion kinda comes up short. It's one of thoes things... Now we're in the indistructable box, now we get an hour of the bad guys trying to break into it. I felt pretty secure for the people I was supposed to be feeling scared for.However, I did like the acting in the movie, which is why I gave it a 3. Everyone in the movie was at the top of their game for this one. Made it into a nice drama with a little heart pounding action, but not really the thriller it tried to look like it was.It has rewatchability if you like it, so my recomendation is to rent it, see if you like it, then go out and buy it."
3,Good Characters and Bad Plot,"The high point of this movie was it's extremely interesting collection of bad guys. Three bad guys to be exact. And each of them were totally different. One was really an ups and downs type who would throw himself headlong into anything until the first bump in the road. The next was a real good hearted guy that wanted what he wanted. And the last was impassive, collected, and unflinching at anything. It was really fun getting to watch these guys play against the good girls. I'll admit I got to wanting one of the bad guys to win!The bad points of the movie were it had almost no plot and that lead to an almost perfectly predictability. Also from the same bad plotting came lots of completely useless scenes and scenes just plain dragged out way too far.It wasn't bad, but I'm sure you couldn't say it was good."
3,Normal,"I wouldn't call this a good movie but at the same time I would not say it was bad. There were some stellar performances that actually kept the movie afloat with a plot line that was a small variation from those ""innocent distressed folks striking back"". At times the next scene was very predictable. But what helped this movie was the always good performance by Jodie Foster and the stellar performance of Forrest Whitaker, who in my opinion was the best in the movie. Dwight Yoakam turned in a suprise effort, to me, on how he could manage to make his nasty character so believable.Overall this movie will do when there is nothing that may look more interesting."
2,Fincher should be ashamed of himself for this...,"Oh, how I could not wait to see this movie. Being a huge fan of David Fincher, I broke my rule of never going to a show on its opening night. Big Mistake! Talk about a boring movie. Right from the beginning, it seemed painfully obvious that nothing would become of this film (dare I even call it that). Leto was just so awful, that I was glad to see him go - not soon enough in my opinion. Jodie Foster - what a waste of talent (probably her easiest acting job to date). And that little girl of hers - reminded me of everything I didn't like about Terminator 2. Enough cheesy one liners to make you physically ill. I personally found myself not really caring about the movie's outcome after an hour or so. It's THAT bad. This is one of those, ""Oh it's on cable for the 42nd time movies"" Why was the audience laughing aloud? Why did I get the same urge to leave that I had when watching AI ??? Probably because it's THAT bad! Yuk!"
4,Panic Room,"A very awesome and suspensful Jodie Foster flick. The preveiws may look like this movie is kind of scary , but not really . More suspensful than scary actually. I liked this movie because even though it had only five characters , they carried the movie on so well . Good example of this also happening , Tom Hanks inCast Away . Go see it! Starring: Jodie Foster , Forest Whitaker , Kristen Stewart , Jared Leto , and Dwight Yokem."
5,AWSOME MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!,I bought this movie and watched it. It was so good so so so exiting and so suspencful threen men broke into jodie fosters home her and her daughter where sleeping the three men did not know someone was home the thought no one was home but they wake up and see in the camras and there are peple in her home. I dont want to give it away but I think you should get it and OWN IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!YOU WILL WANT TO WATCH OVER AND OVER!
2,Weak...,"Good idea for a Hitchcockian thriller, but oh so far from it. Fault doesn't lie so much with the director or actors, it is just an extreamly weak screenplay. Every character is a moron. So many obvious flaws that it would be hard to explain here, but suffice it to say I was looking at my watch after about an hour. I really enjoy Jodie Foster and Forest Whitaker. They are fine actors and usually very selective about what they will do. Apparently accepting these roles caught them in a weak moment. Rent if you must, but save your hard earned money for another purchase."
2,Not a horror movie!,"I purchased this as a rental here on Amazon because it was listed as a scary movie. This is not a horror or scary movie in any sense of the word. Yes, its a thriller but not one that captivated my attention."
3,Good movie -- lame packaging,"This was the first DVD that I didn't buy in a store because it's not in a standard plastic ""keep case"". It's in a cheap cardboard package, which I find unnecessarily inconsistent and rather annoying."
3,a little tense,"Even though Panic Room started off on a slow foot, it picks up for the most part. This is one of those films that can probably happen in real life. The girl who played Jodie Foster's daughter did a very good job in my opinion and the middle of the movie will leave you wondering how Jodie and her daughter will get out alive."
2,An average thriller with outstanding direction,"David Fincher has done a few great movies in the past. ""The Game"" or the masterpiece ""Fight Club"" come to mind. ""Panic Room"", despite the decent acting and the excellent photography and camera-tricks, doesn`t impress all that much and enters into familiar and predictable ground. It`s a watchable thriller with a couple of twists that kept me entertained for a while, but it doesn`t go beyound that. For the most part, it isn`t too difficult to figure out what is going to happen, and the lackluster ending only makes it worse. Appropriate to watch in a rainy night when there is nothing else to do, since it`s still good enough to kill a couple of hours. A rental, not a keeper."
2,renter...,"Panic Room was a short film done with a big budget. The story? Uninspiring. It's your basic home robbery. As a big fan of Fincher's commercial and cinematic work, I was quite dissapointed. Fincher's impressive camera work was wasted in this movie, even forced. Foster was good but too bad her character lacked depth. Rent it if you must."
3,"good movie, disappointing dvd","i really enjoy this movie quite a bit, but i was extremely disappointed with the total lack of any interesting special features on the dvd. fincher's ""fight club"" was an example of a great and thorough dvd set, but this one doesn't even try. i couldn't care less about ""superbit"" video...i'd much rather have a commentary track from fincher & foster."
2,Ho hum,"Run of the mill attempt at suspense failed to leave me wanting to care if either side would win the battle. The thing that bothered me the most about this movie is all the twists in plot seemed to be based on some sort of ESP going on between antagonist and protagonist. The concept seemed good, quality actors were there, setting was perfect, but the writer spent way too much time trying to dazzle with trickery and McGuiver like rigging of the environment."
3,Just ok,"Not nearly as exciting as the previews made it seem. There is some tension and a bit of action, but mostly this movie seemed to be a waste of great acting talent. The characters just had nowhere to go. It was entertaining enough to justify renting, however, and I wouldn't say it wasn't worth watching.Often the problem with these type of ""premise"" movies is that they just don't have enough to make a full length feature film. What happens is the audience is expected to accept as possible a bunch of ""why would they do that?"" or ""could that really happen?"" situations and as they pile up they end up making the story too unbelievable."
2,Surprisingly Bland,"I was surprised that David Fincher directed this film. After such an incredible film like Fight Club, I don't know why he would even glance at a script as dull and unlikely as this one. Even more shocking was that Jodie Foster pried herself out of the director's chair to act in a movie that wasn't powerful or thought provoking in any way. There weren't even any striking special effects to keep me mildly amused. It's not the worst movie ever made, but it's certainly not the best either."
4,Don't Panic,"How can it be that in a horror movie, you can be hit over the head with a shovel and be hit over the banisters down two flights of stairs falling on your head and get up and still know not only where you are but who you are, and I know of people who trip over their feet and twist an ankle and cannot walk.....But lets be sensible for a mo, Jodie Foster is great at pulling loads of faces, just when she is ment to, I love her to bits, her acting is as ever, very very good, and this film lets you know that even if your doing bad, you might just have a heart too. well done Jodie, I'll buy the DVD when it comes out. Any chance of some tickets or something Jodie."
3,"""Panic Room"" is alright","Panic Room has one of the more interesting ideas for a movie i've seen in a while. A divorced women and her young daughter must face 3 ruthless criminals with unknown intentions from a secure ""Panic Room."" The movies plot suspenseful and enjoyable until the very end and the panic room theme plays out very well. Unfortunatly the shallow characters and incredible stupidity of the main character, as well an unsatisfactory ending, bring the movie down a few notches. The film has some unrealism that don't go with the films seriousness (How many swat teams would yell ""Freeze Motha-F****""?). If you don't mind the home-aloneish qualities, it's a fairly enjoyable movie."
5,Fincher rocks!,"It's great to see Foster in the movies again, I wish she made more films, she is so intelligent and full of intensity, always wonderful.I was very impressed with Forest Witicer and Dwight Yokum(they play his music at where I work!) The two of them are very driven by different things and it works very well here.Don't see this movie if you are a fraidy cat, you have been warned!!!!"
1,I think my IQ went negative while watching...,"I love movies, even bad ones. Even after watching a bad movie I usually have the pleasure of playing critic with my friends. ""Panic Room"" offers so little plot and such thin characters that we ran out of conversation material 15 minutes after the movie. We could have found more material to analyze in a test pattern. I did have a few laughs with this movie, but if I could get that two hours of my life back I would. The camera work is splendid but not enough to save this movie. Fincher, Foster and Whittaker are great - in other movies. Dwight Yuck-um should not quit his day job, and the actor who played the other thug has already faded from memory. I had to really think about this review because the ""Home Alone"" reference was already taken. If you watch this movie, treat it like a dark comedy B movie and you'll be OK."
2,Lame Room,"I don't mind suspending my disbelief during a thriller --otherwise, it would be impossible to enjoy any of them-- but I do mind when filmmakers make such stupid choices, it is simply impossible to believe anything that's going on. That's what happens when Jodie Foster (who works hard to save this film) and her daughter get stuck in the panic room of their new mansion, where three thieves have broken into. The problem, of course, is the treasure they want is in the panic room, so the two women are forced to spend quite some time in this room, which is not such a terrible problem, since it has been built for that same purpose. The room contains a toilet, flashlights, fire blankets, a medicine kit--pretty much anything you would need in an emergency, except a single piece of food. Maybe the builders of the panic room expected people to eat the blankets. The movie has other moments that are simply unbelievable, which is too bad, because this could have been a pretty good thriller."
4,"Though not a masterpiece, a movie worth watching!","Panic Room, brings to the screen the story of a mother and daughter as they barricade themselves in a built-in bunker in an effort to avoid capture by three men who are after a treasure which is located... you guessed it, in the bunker!The major setback is in relation to the plot, which is about average. Specifically, the mother does some pretty incredible and unrealistic things such as the setting of the propane on fire!Or the whole wire tapping and getting the telephone to work thing...Moreover, Kristen Stewart playing the ""daughter"" was not that wonderful. The seemingly genderless child, who is surprisingly cool throughout the whole ordeal, is really not that great.Aside from that, the movie is pretty good!It combines drama, action, and adventure making it rather enjoyable, as long as you're in that kind of a mood."
4,Panic Room (2002),"Excellent thriller starring Jodie Foster as a woman divorced from her husband who moves into a mysterious old house (complete with a high-tech elevator that was necessary for the previous owner) where there is a panic room that contains something desperately desired by a threesome of thieves who break into the house causing Foster and her on-screen daughter to compete and race for their lives in a classic cat-and-mouse chase. Extreme suspense, gripping performances and a well-laid out script help to make this another ultimate thriller...rare for today's film! An outstanding achievement!"
2,"Great Actors, but not great story.","All the actors, especially Jodie Foster and Forest Whitaker, do outstanding jobs in their roles. In the beginning, you start to believe this thriller will be a game of wits. But in the middle of it, Jodie Foster's character starts doing things that, given the circumstances, is just ridiculous. The burglars have so many options to place the circumstances back into their favor, but rather than have the advantage (even though they have a great bargaining tool at their expense), they do things that are just plain stupid. A person with any decent sense of common sense could do better. Worth watching for some great acting, but because of the [bad] story, wait for the bargain theaters or wait for video."
2,Intense? Not so much...,"Okay, I was ready to be on the edge of my seat. Go ahead, scare me! Well, I stayed in the middle of my seat and was somewhat entertained, but suspense? Maybe a little. These bad guys actually cracked me up. Dwight Yoakham, I have to say, can deliver the bad guy like nobody else. I didn't even recognize him for awhile. The camera work was...interesting. Made me slightly nauseous. I didn't see how it affected the story or complemented the movie. Something they just thought would be really ""cutting edge"". The outcome of the movie is predictable (c'mon! You think they're gonna kill off Jodie Foster?). The actual ending was, in a word, bad. But all in all, I can't say I hated it. I call a rental and be done with it."
3,"""Home Alone"" for adults","I was expecting an exciting thriller, but the movie did not meet my expectations. Although Jodie Foster's acting is fine, the story itself is not that convincing. Very little happened in a very long time. The constant hide and seek between Jodie Foster and the theives reminded me of the movie Home Alone. It got to the point where I thought, ""What's next, is she going to throw the marbles down the stairs now (like the boy in Home Alone)?"" I believe that Jodie Foster's daughter was a miscast, because she was unappealing, and you just didn't care that much for her. And she looked like a boy! All in all, the movie has its exciting moments, but overall, merely borderline OK."
3,Never went in the Room,"I have such mixed feelings about this movie and here's why: it's boring. The movie really is about two hours of monotony. However, David Fincher has a great concept here and filming using such minimal sets hasn't been done as effectively since Hitchcock. The idea of a one room horror film is fascinating but the movie fails to be truly gripping. What it does succeed at is ""feeling"" right. David Fincher managed to grasp that indescribable something that makes everyone say ""cool"" even though they are quite possibly bored out of their minds. It would be a nice movie to add to the collection if you happen to have some extra cash lying around and are looking for something a little bit different."
4,Riveting!,"A very suspenseful thriller--well-crafted, directed, and acted, with a full variety of characterizations and non-stop, heart-pounding scares. Recommended,"
2,"Parentheses, please...","David Fincher just doesn't seem comfortable (or should that be capable of?) making two good films in a row. For every Seven and Fight Club we've had an Alien 3 and The Game. Panic Room slots comfortably into the latter bracket - it's just Fincher-by-numbers, the Big Man treading water whilst he waits for a half-decent script to drop in his letterbox. Take one waifer-thin premise, flesh it out with a few decent performances (and, courtesy of Jared Leto, one of the worst this reviewer has seen in a long time) and some flashy editing, and what do you get? On this evidence, just another disposable popcorn flick. Coming from such an obvious talent, that's pretty sloppy work indeed."
3,Not what I expected,"In my opinion (mean no offense for other reviewers), this movie Is the dramatic version of ""Home alone"", an excellent actress got caught in home by a bunch of dumb, unlucky and incompetent criminals."
3,2.5 stars,"Okay this wasn't that good. It's your typical suspense thriller, that uses the standard plot of it's genre, and comes to a predictable conclusion that you expected at the beggining. Nothing special here. Even the acting wasn't that great. This isn't a complete waste of time, no it's a perfect way to kill a few hours. This is one I'd only watch if there was nothing else on."
4,Glover's solo work always surprisingly good,"Several times between 1983 and 1985 I was asked to work at one of my employer's branch offices for a day. In each case, the day in question turned out to be that day; fourteen hours later I'd find myself driving home after flying to Salt Lake City or Phoenix, making half a dozen sales calls, then flying back to Denver. I was on one of these trips in early 1984, sitting in my rental car killing time before my flight home, when I heard ""The Mask."" I was surprised to learn that the song was Roger Glover's, but not the least bit surprised when it became a minor hit. Glover dabbled in the production side of the music business, working with a variety of new bands when not playing bass with Deep Purple. In 1988, Glover and Purple pal Ian Gillan released Accidentally on Purpose, a singular LP that contains ""She Took My Breath Away,"" ""Via Miami,"" and the prophetic ""Telephone Box"" (to which cell phone junkies everywhere should take a good, hard listen)."
1,I hope you're fluent in German. You'll have to be.,"That's right, friends. Uwe, in his infinite wisdom, decided to release his early German films to the US market in this box set. It's obviously meant for the US market, because the DVD format is NTSC and the box art and packaging is all in English. Uwe was even nice enough to introduce every movie in English. Oh, did I mention the movies themselves were in German with NO SUBTITLES and NO DUBBING options? I wish someone had explained that to me before I plunked down 25 bucks. I guess I just assumed that people who market foreign films in the US would naturally include subtitles in the LANGUAGE OF THE COUNTRY IN WHICH ITS BEING SOLD! But we're talking about Uwe Boll. You were expecting competence?"
2,Not as bad as self abuse.,"The DVD is not as bad as I had read it was. There are only 2 movies in the set that actually have subtitles. It is obvious that it was designed for the German market and Uwe Boll thought he could make a few quick bucks in North America. That said his early films are not that bad ,but without a working knowledge of German why bother watching them.The main reason I bought the set was for his first film German Fried Movie. Sadly it is one of the two without subtitles and I can't tell if he has a sense of humour or the joke is really on us.The bonus disc promised that for a few extra bucks we could get his serial killer film Run Amok. It doesn't seem to be listed on Amazon so I guess the joke is on us."
2,You get what you pay for!,"This is a good budget priced cd, but there are some mistakes. The most glaring is that track 15 is not ""Blue Shadows on the Trails"" and is not even Roy Rogers!!! The song you get is ""I Never See Maggie Alone"", and it sounds like Kenny Roberts to me. There are a few more songs I wonder about as well.Caveat Emptor!!! The songs do sound good, and I did enjoy them, but was bemused by the glaring errors."
5,THE standard for learning Irish,"Míchael ó Siadhail is a leading scholar and teacher of the Irish language. Once you get past the phonetics.. important for ear training - this course is the cornerstone of the study of Irish as spoken in the West. A few people report trouble; perhaps they are looking for an instant Irish phrasebook approach. For the serious student who truly desires to learn Irish, there is no substitute for this book."
5,Intense!,"If you want to learn to speak Irish, this is the book and tapes for you. To me without the tapes it would take twice as long.The language is a difficult one. For many reasons. And as another reviewer stated there are so many letters in words that are silent. The pronunciations are very different from ours, for example the authors name is pronounced Meal O'Sheal. But this book is so detailed they even tell you how to place your tongue in your mouth when pronouncing sounds. I started to take notes on index cards to help me, but everything I tried to short cut that way was already listed exactly that way somewhere in the book already as a quick reference guide. It's not something you'll learn over night, but this will definately teach you."
2,Wrong Version,"The seller sent me the wrong edition. I spent days looking for it, the one pictured on this page, because my professor wanted it specifically. There is nothing wrong or different with the new one, but it falls apart in a matter of weeks."
3,More disclosure please,Delivery was very quick and was well packed. The book was in fair condition although it is stained on many pages from some type of liquid. This was not disclosed in the condition report.Since I don't know what the liquid is it kinda creeps me out.
4,Good for lists and grammar,"I have been studying Irish for the last 2 1/2 years from a top professor in the area here in the states. At first we used the ""Teach Yourself Irish"" book and tapes for an into, and then she made her own materials. This book I have found is a good resource for finding lists of grammar, conjugations, vocab etc. I highly reccomend that since it is such a difficult language to find a qualified teacher who you can work with face to face, since much of the pronunciation is difficult and varies from county to county. But, if that isn't available to you or you have moved on from a class and want to study more, this is a great resource to reflect on! It has more mechanics than the conversation driven Teach Yourself, and goes more in deapth than any other book or book/tape set I've seen. Also, if you're looking for additional resources, check out www.readireland.comGood luck! lena gra geal mo chroi, slan!"
5,Grandmother's Nursery Rhymes/Las Nanas De Abuelita: Lullabie,"I bought this book in the interest of my Spanish-speaking nanny and my 15 month-old boy. He is drawn to the pictures in this book. They are particularly appealing with their whimsical nature and bright colors. Our nanny loves the rhymes and she feels right at home reading to him from the book unlike with some other translations of rhymes that end up with mispronunciations in Spanish. My favorite part of it is that I read the ""quiet time"" rhymes (in English) at the end of the book to him at night and they are actually very calming to him. That's rare! And, I would recommend it soley on that even if it weren't great otherwise."
4,Not for the faint of stomach or heart,"This novel follows two brothers into the world of sexual slavery, a world they thought was make believe but which becomes all too real when they are kidnapped and sold on the Arab market. There is a lot of intense torture, both physical and mental, as well as incest in various forms in this book so be forewarned. The story is told in three parts: the encounter that leads them into slavery, the challenge of surviving slavery, and their rescue and reconnection to their father."
4,I loved it!,This is one of the best Larry Townsend books I ever read. It was very good and seriously intense. It is NOT for the faint of heart and unless you want to read homo-erotica that focuses on sexual slavery (and all that the image that word congers up) don't bother.I've read almost all Larry wrote and this work is near the top of the list.
5,Bill Was a Family Friend,"My father, Joe Wallace, was the national president for the Seventh Step Foundation which Bill founded. It was the orginal ""Scared Straight"" program. Bill was a dynamic man and I can honestly say that his book and my father's association with him was always in the back of my mind as I grew up. At a very young age, I saw first handed how crime can destroy a person. I wholeheartedly recommend this book for anyone who is having issues with their loved ones who may be in trouble."
4,Galactic guitar distortion!,"This is one of my favorite albums from the 90's and here it is being sold for cheap! So you have no excuse for not owning it. This is where GC sound the most like King's X and that's a good thing. The mixing here is top-notch and the the songwriting is just as good. (The guitars are THICK.) ""My school"" seems like an anthem of sorts to me. Before I was married I used to find some solace in ""Someone for everyone"". But standing above all the others is ""Speak To Me"", a Dream Theater-esque 11 minute epic with gorgeous acoustic guitar and thick riffs in the middle. Hearing this album, and especially this song, for the first time was a revelation to me. Essential."
3,"A good start, but the best was yet to come","Galactic Cowboys' debut album starts off with 3 strong tracks, but lags a bit from there on, with the exception of ""Kill Floor"" -- speaking of which, I found it a bit odd that a group of professed Christians would compose a song that many Christians in positions of authority would cite as violent and, most likely, as being a negtive influence. But at any rate, it's worth the cost of the album for those 4 songs alone. If you're new to Galactic Cowboys, I'd suggest picking up ""Space In Your Face"" or ""At The End of The Day"" first."
3,"Pretty Good, Give This A Listen","I first was exposed to the Galactic Cowboys back in 1990 when I saw them opening up for King's X in Memphis. Of course when I saw them that night, this album still had not been released, but they still played some or all of the songs on this album. They eventually released this album and I bought it. Not the greatest album, but it still has some good moments. I remember thinking that they sounded like a cross between King's X and Metallica. This album has a thick, beefy production and energetic songs. There are also good backing vocals that remind me of bands like King's X. ""Why Can't You Believe in Me"" would have to be the best track (good backing vocals). ""My School"" is also a good song. ""Kaptain Krude"" is a heavy-hitter with aggresive guitar work. Lyrically, I believe it talks about the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill. This is a pretty good album."
4,Unusual but GREAT original bizarre heavy tunes!,"This great band sadly split a few years back and have only played a handful of shows since. This their debut first album is from around 1991, and was a highly different heavy rock album. They mixed up heavy thrash metal, grunge kind of sound, with catchy big melodic pop BEATLES style sounds. This was probaly some of their heavier tunes, but still equally very melodic uplifting and with catchy choruses unlike any other heavy bands.They put out around another four or five albums, getting less heavy more groove and trippy pop sounding as time passed. Very cool metal strangeness with uplifting moments not to be missed. Lets hope these mad guys get back together in future."
5,TUFF!,"The title speaks for itself. Yes Humble Pie were street rats. The music on this album is tuff stuff. A little bit o blues, soul, r&r, and a lot of balls. I can see why I had to wait so long for this. I wore out my vinal version. Losing Steve was a tragidy not only to we PIE HEADS, but to the music buiz as a whole. Steves voice is what every vocalist dreams of. There ain't nuttin he couldn't do, and to perfection. wanna hear what I mean. BUY IT!"
5,SUPERB SOUND,"REALLY, THIS JAPANESE REMASTERED VERSION, SOUNDS PERFECT! A SUPERB SOUND, LYRICS, ETC... 1000 STARS FOR UNIVERSAL JAPAN!"
5,love this book,such a wonderful book to teach about the importance of self acceptance and love for others we can't all be the same how boring would that be
4,A fun read,"Its a fun read with great pics! Not as good as Big Words for Little People, but still one of our favs."
2,so so,"Didnt really like this book as much as i thought i would. It didnt express its message as clearly and deeply as the first book i bought of theirs, ""Is there really a such thing as a human race?"""
5,A great book about children&#65533;s self-esteem,"This is a fun book that teaches little kids self-esteem and by implication cautions parents when not to criticize their children. The book ends with a nice question that draws the child being read to into a good conversation about himself or herself. The illustrations are a riot.Gisela Gasper Fitzgerald, Author of ADOPTION: An Open, Semi-Open or Closed Practice?"
5,Important book,"Whether or not a child is fast or slow, they have value. This book reinforces that concept by telling the child to like themself despite their strengths or weaknesses."
4,Builds self esteem!,This book is a self esteem builder. I would recommend it to any parent wanting to teach their child that have self worth.
4,Exactly as advertised,"Purchased as a Valentine's day gift for my wife --the item arrived promptly (as always w/ Amazon) and was everything the description said it would be --the pearl is well shaped, has good color and arrived in a nice gift box w/ complete care instructions. My wife loves it!! I have purchased DVD's, books, tools and jewelry from Amazon --everything has been exactly as described and has arrived BEFORE promised. They are my e-tailer of choice."
5,GREAT GREAT GREAT!,I loved this book! It has so many different ideas about how to help you feel more interested in making love. I like that the ideas about not things like porn or other awful things that in the end bring you down. After reading this book I feel like I am closer to my husband but also I feel like I understand more the way I was feeling about making love and how to keep it positive and fun! Thank you Shelia Wray Gregoire! This book really helped me out and my husband is benefiting from it too :)
3,Okay book,"This might be helpful for a newly married person, but I've read so many Christian books on the subject, that this one didn't really have anything new for me. It is a well written book though."
4,Great book!,I've been married 15 years and this book was a gem. It was the first book I've read by this author and I found it very insightful. I highly recommend this book to any married couples.
3,"Performs as expected, color mismatch","They are larger than the stock black trailer rollers and spin better. They do not mark up the boat as the stock black ones did.The product performs as expected. However, the supplier didn't ensure the color on all three parts matched. The colors are subtlety different.It something 99% of the people will never notice, but when you purchase a brand new product, you expect it to look brand new and mine looks like a mismatch or like I purchased it in two different visits to the store. Boating is expensive and it cheapens the look... Again, it a great product and I highly recommend it. Just wish the packager had put in a little extra effort to make the experience perfect."
5,"This Time Around..An Album from a Matured, Talented Band","Hanson has shown amazing and delightful maturity with their second album! The growth is evident in all their lyrics, compositions and vocal talents. The bluesy influence is apparent, overlaid by rock and some pop . This is a band to follow. They will prevail and become legends in their own time."
1,Early Novel -- Skip This One,"I searched out Tess Gerritsen as the author of the books that inspired the new tv show Rissoli & Isles, which I love. As I usually do, I hit an online auction site to find book bargains, lots of books for a few dollars. If I was rich I would buy all Kindle versions, but I'm not.In this case I am so glad that it was a bargain. Whistleblower is one of the most frustrating books I have read. I want suspense. I want action. I want intrigue. In this book the two protagonists stop every few feet to make out. Yes, the story is constantly interrupted with ""romance"". Not even good romance.I have read three of Gerritsen's other books and love them. Do not judge an author by one book that didn't quite make it.Gerritsen is a talented author who wrote one less than thrilling thriller. Loved The Surgeon, Harvest, Life Support. Reading The Bone Garden at this moment and love it so far."
1,really?,"Really, really awful. The characters are overly dramatic, and the narration on the abridged audio version makes things even worse. A real disappointment."
1,leaks,disappointing..leaks freezes up tooo often seems unsafe-took too long to arrive and delayed the process.very unhappy.........................not the greatest...not worth the money
1,can you here that,"after one use, wait not even one use it developed an air leak and i lost all the co2. also it did not come with a co2 cartridge as advertised."
3,Pictures misleading,"Amazon's recommendation for keg valves to be used with this mobile charger is misleading as the inlet gas valve will not work with this charger (no screw threads). Also this charger will not produce enough gas to carbonate the beer in a short amount to time and is used mainly to dispense the beer from the keg. It might take at least 2 16 g. cartridges to empty a 5 gal keg. You also need to note which of the types of valves you have on your keg, pin or ball."
2,Lund 18039 Interceptor Bug Shield,"I have had Lund bug shields on my las 4 vehicles and I have never had to drill holes in my hood on any of them, until I bought this one for my Toyota 4Runner! Yes, I have had this same Lund Bug Shield on two previous 4Runners and never drilled the first hole. Lund makes the best bug shields than any other manufacturer as far as I am concerned but I don't know whose fault this one was. I was able to line up one hole before the drilling started, then I had to drill every single hole except the first one! It is on, it looks great, and it is great quality. Like I said, Lund has always met my expectations but someone dropped the ball on this oneI would reccommend it to a friend, IF, he/she did not mind drilling holes!"
1,Boring collection of short stories,"Having bought several other works with Laurie Notaro's name on it and gotten some good laughs out of them, I was expecting more of the same, only to be sorely disappointed. This is a collection of short stories that are rambling and not particularly well written. The best you might get out of this is a smirk; don't waste your money - go buy one of Notaro's other full novels and thoroughly enjoy yourself."
2,This is a compilation,"I enjoyed reading some of the authors in this book (eg Ayun Halliday), but these stories aren't necessarily new- they're extracts from already published novels. I was disappointed about this as I was looking for well crafted short stories, but what you get is a series of anecdotes, not all of them funny and not many of them particularly interesting.Look up the contributors and buy their individual works."
1,Don't set yourself up for dissapointment,"When you compile other authors' stories, you might hire an editor to find all your grammar mistakes. I counted 3 without really looking. Mostly good stories, but not as funny as Laurie Notaro's books. I had high expectations and was very dissapointed, overall."
2,blah,"A humorous collection of travel tales by women writers I picked up because Laurie Notaro is included and I figured she would be among equal talent. She was not. Decent writing and a few chuckles, interesting tales of far off and not-so-far off travels. There's much better beach/summer chick lit out there (like any of Laurie Notaro's works). Grade: C"
2,Lost one post within the first day,The product was beautiful! But the post came unscrewed during the first night I slept in them and I now only have one earring.... $40 down the drain.
2,Armed Forces (WW II) edition,The Seller did not state that this paperback was an Armed Forces edition - missing photographs et al.
5,Great Harina P.a.n,"Great quality with a good cost, if you are crazy looking for this in the stores, just buy it here is better, and actually pretty fast shipping. Is exactly the same that i would buy at Venezuela, and taste the same too."
5,Lovely Arepas!,"I am so glad I can now find my favorite flour thanks to Amazon. There is not store around my area that will carry it. Now, I can have again my Venezuelan breakfast even though I am in northern CA."
3,harina pan,"I was looking for harina pan, I received the product, maybe there is a better way to send the product"
5,Exactly what I expected,A brilliant guide to London - some off the beaten track walks to discover different aspects of a wonderful city.
5,Perfect for a competitors steak knife set,This high quality block of wood is perfect for our surgical steel steak knife set made by a competitor who did not have a storage block for sale.
2,An Actor's Book of Eh,"Not a bad book, I wouldn't read it again. This book looks into 14 acting styles that one actor will loose their mind trying to figure out which one is best for them. I personally sick with Miesner and Stanislavsky and I have done fine. The movements are different and unique and are not for everyone. It reads like an instruction manual and unless you have someone familiar with the movement good luck trying to decipher the text."
4,Well constructed product.,"I bought this item to drain toilet tanks when replacing fill valves, etc. It works very well and it's really well made. It's also bigger than I expected but it works great and will probably last forever. There's a lot of uses for this product."
5,Great Pump,The long length of this pump made it very simple to pump out my bilge. Smooth action and well built.
5,Solid pump at a decent price,"Pump develops a nice steady water flow with average pumping effort. Nice long barrel and hose, although not sure if you could extend outflow hose if you needed something longer. All in all, a solid pump at a good price."
4,"Sucks well, but hose too short!",Use it to pump out 125 gal. duck pond. Works well except the hose is only 3 ft long. Used a shop vac hose that's about 8 ft long. Other than that I'm happy with it. Took about 45 minutes to drain pond. Good price and quality!
3,pump,"this is a very good product, fit my need very well, would recommend it to all users, thank you very much"
5,great little bilge pump for the price on Amazon,I use this bilge pump to empty my buckets of water in which I process my prospecting material. These small pumps really empty the water fast. I use to dump full buckets and they were heavy and would crack upon tilting to empty.So far I am very satified with my purchases through Amazon.
2,Toy bilge pump,"I bought this pump after reading the positive reviews. I used it to empty a small pool spa after a rain and note the following: the hose is only 2' long and stiff, and it pops out of it's fitting. Water leaks out of the top on the upstrokes. Better than using a paper cup to scoop out water, but cheaply made and you are rue to get all wet."
2,Leaky and Fragile,"After five years of fairly light use, this thing gave out on me when I needed it most. The piston rod detached from its head. I'm of the opinion that it should not have broken under the use it was receiving.It undoubtedly moves a great deal more water much more quickly than a lot of other things that I've tried to bail with, but (as other reviewers noted) it leaks out the top due to an imperfect seal of the hose, drenching the cabin interior, as well as my clothes.Another problem is that the hose is far too short to lead to anywhere useful. The best work-around was to remove the hose and place a large bucket under the pump's outlet, then haul topsides to dump.PROS* pretty long and pumps from hard-to-reach places* pump action is pretty easy* it's light, I supposeCONS* very leaky* hose doesn't quite put the water where you need it* too fragileIn summary, it translates a lot of water 18 inches somewhere else until it decides not to anymore."
2,Less than perfect,The pump efficiently moves water - which is good. It would be better if it hadn't started to leak so much of said water out of the top quite so fast (I only got it a few hours ago!). I guess I'll try to patch it up to stop the leaking (which I suspect is due to a very cheap and poorly fitting seal for the outflow pipe) but there must be better pumps out there without that inconvenience.
5,All you need is love!,"This is one of my favorite movies ever. If you haven't already seen it, you have to now! The acting that Sean Penn did is simply stunning. The camera work is great also. i love how they put Beatles songs all through out the movie. Not sung by the Beatles, but they are still good. Please don't listen to any of the people that gave this bad reviews. This is the best movie ever made in my opinion. It's stunning that a movie could be so good. You won't be sorry that you bought it, believe me!!!!"
4,DVD Packaging?,"I have a question for anybody who has purchased this item from Amazon recently.Does the DVD come in a cardboard ""snapper"" case or a plastic keep case?I've seen both at retail with the same UPC and was not sure what Amazon had...called customer service but they couldn't give me a straight answer.Help would be appreciated."
5,At least a whole box of tissues...,"What a movie! The themes of love and loss, the underdog who wins in the end. The bullies who torment the sweet underdog are the stuff of legend.This movie is full of archetypal images. But mostly it is about love!All You Need Is Love!Gonna keep this short and sweet because lots of other people have already reviewed it.1. The acting is wonderful2. The script is good as well, obviously fairly unrealistic3. It is a real feel good movie4. I fell in love with Sam when he was naming his baby from The Beatles song5. I cried my eyes out the entire time6. It was cool seeing Data in a bit part and the Lady of the Evening also being a cast member of Next Gen was great as wellBuy it. I guarantee you'll watch again and again! Just make sure you have lots of tissues on hand!"
1,Wow. This film is really bad.,"As a brother to a mentally hadicapped individual and an employee of my city's social services department, I could not begin to point out all the misconceptions brought to light in this film."
2,"A classical example of ""non-director"" movie.","I went to see this mostly because od S.Penn and I think he plays very cool, but using most of the acting-tools seen on similar roles before (f.e. L.diCaprio in What's Eating Gillbert Grape?).Otherwise this movie was a huge disappointment for me, because nothing is actually belivable in it. Reasons for actions are plain, translucent and sometimes even weird. The story does not stick together, but gets dispersed also in the first, but really awful in the second part. The movies there gets to be a real dull experience that u forget about on the road home already. I know some people will talk about its great theme and how the love winns all and such sugar, but it has been done so many times and much more convincing then here.Have to say at the end that M.Pfeiffers performance was better than expected. Still not great, but ok."
3,"Shakey Camera could make you WOOZEY! Good film, so-so.","Overall, this is a good film. A little Hokey, but sentimental.The entire film was done with HAND HELD CAMERAS, so you might notice you're getting DIZZY. Once you notice this and try to watch the film a second time, you become annoyed by the camera work. Just my opinion."
2,"If you like sentimental schmalz, it's for you.","I watched this, only because of the many positive comments on Amazon. I have to agree with all those who wrote negative comments. I recorded it from TV, have now seen it, and have now erased it. You can't argue with the people who love it, and cry every time they see it. Our brains are different. I'm in the minority - I wouldn't recommend this film to anybody, and I'm glad I didn't pay to see it."
2,"Good Actors, Bad Film","This film has some saving graces: decent performances by the suppoting cast, particularly the men in Sean Penn's support group, as well as Michelle Pfeiffer and Laura Dern and an adorable child actress playing Penn's daughter, and a charming title sequence. That said, this is a totally manipulative movie, with overacting by Sean Penn as the mentally challenged father trying to regain custody of his daughter. The plot is melodramatic and tugs at the audience's hearts strings in all the predictable ways. And the product placements - particularly Starbucks and Pizza Hut - are truly obnoxious. (Why can't Sean Penn work at an independent coffeehouse?)"
3,OK movie.,"I liked the movie but can't say it was compelling. I think it is good, worth a look. Wouldn't say it resonates but solid performances by the main characters."
5,Definitely a Must See!!,"I am Sam is such a great movie. It is so touching and moving, heartfelt and compassionate. Anyone who enjoys movies that has depth, emotion, ""I am Sam"" is the perfect choice. You will not be disappointed."
4,you'll laugh and cry- its a very good movie,"this movie is very touching. i wont retell the story because thats already been done, but i would like to say that it is definitely worth seeing. sean penn and dakota fanning both give outstanding performances. very good."
5,Very Heart Warming Story-Line,"Brief Synopsis: A mentally challenged man has a baby with a women. When they are coming down the stairs of the hospital after the birth of the child the girl tells Sam to hold the baby becuase she will be right back. She then disappears and Sam is left with a child. At his apartment the nicest lady helps care for the child. Then when Sam goes to school they find out that he shouldn't have been taking care of the girl. The girl then goes to a foster home. Then Sam gets visitations but he wants to have the girl all the time so he goes to court and he wins, so he can enjoy the rest of his life with her.This story really touched me to respect mentally-challenged people more becuas ethey are capable of mostly everything we can do like raising children. I gave this story 5 stars becuase it is very touching. I recomend it to anyone who likes these feel good movies."
4,Incredible Performances,"Sean Penn and Dakota Fanning are outstanding in their roles as Father and Daughter in this film. Michelle Pfeiffer does a good job as the attorney who comes to their rescue. But the script seemed more along the lines of a tv-movie of the week. Unfortunately, the script was just not that well-written. In spite of that, Sean Penn deserves his best actor nomination, his portrayl is perfect."
2,Help!,"This film is not for everyone. It's definitely sentimental (if you like that in film). It's about an autistic man who is fond of the Beatles and is trying to raise a young daughter. Child services tries to ""protect"" the child by placing her in separate custody. A court battle ensues.Good points: Excellent acting. Dakota Fanning was only 7 years old when she made this. And anyone who can go toe to toe in acting across from Sean Penn is quite an actor.The not so good points: Too much hand-held camerawork. Odd use of monochromatic filters (green and later in the film, blue). Uneven pacing. Inability to sustain my interest.The DVD: Looks sharp and sounds great.DVD extras: I was not interested enough in this film to check out extras, but there seems to be a fair amount.The soundtrack: Very nice remakes of Beatles songs.Let it be......"
2,Nice Try,"Despite a nice effort on the part of Jesse Nelson, I Am Sam did not turn out how I expected it to. Sean Penn, however, is absolutely brilliant. His performance isn't acting. It's something so much more than that. He is Sam. Also, Michelle Pfeiffer is my favorite actress working today. The combination of such talent and such beauty is so rare these days, and it's refreshing to see it in Pfeiffer. But even with these two amazing actors and the stellar supporting cast (although they do little to add to the film), the movie is very flawed. It's manipulative, forced, and contrived. But all means, try the movie, but don't expect to much."
2,silly,This film is ridiculous. It's attempts at forcing the viewer to be emotionally involved are laughable. This is for someone who has no idea how a mentally disabled person acts or lives...but would like to empathize. Please. Anyone who actually thinks this film is anywhere near real life or that believes this could actually happen needs to get their head checked. Go volunteer at a hospital...go donate your time to a real life situation. Not Sean Penn's foolish attempt to gain your attention and sympathies toward a stupidly acted and horribly put-together film. A disgrace to anyone who really knows how these people live and behave.
1,This movie is RETARDED,"I saw this movie yesterday. I decided to check out the reviews to see how badly people blasted it due to the fact that it sucked soooo bad. I am shocked that a lot of people seem to think this movie is good. Sean Penn generally cannot act, and he's even worse at acting retarded. The only part I almost cried at was the closing credits, when I realized I would never get the previous 2 hours of my life back. Why is it that when actors play retarded people their performances are considered great? Any real retarded person could have outacted Penn in this terrible movie. As for the girl -- was she playing a 35 year old woman trapped in an 8 year old's body? Her intelligence and emotional capacity made the movie laughably unrealistic. I would give this movie zero stars if I could."
4,are you open enough to hear a message?,"I wasn't too sure of what this movie was going to be about, other than a mentally challenged father trying to get sole custody of his child. Be aware that this movie is set up like a documentary type of feel.Sean Penn deserves something for his role as ""Sam"" because he acts handicapped really well.I laughed with this movie...not at mentally challenged but because if you LISTEN, you'll realize that as 'simple' as people make them out to be...they are truthful in what they say.This movie is about justice, friendship, father/daughter relationship and most of all love. This movie perhaps isn't for everyone (though it should be) but I'll rate is a 4. And if anything rent it when it comes out for rental, if you are open for a message!"
5,Very Good Impression,This Movie gave a very very good impression about the relationship between the father and his child whatever the mental differents are :)
2,"Spins its wheels real hard, but doesn't make much progress","I had my doubts about this film when it came out and now that I've finally seen it I know why: It's manipulative and unrealistic. Penn does a decent job playing Sam, the mentally handicapped single-father. Pfeiffer's not bad as his high-priced, high-strung lawyer. But neither can save the script from its pitfalls, namely, an unrealistic portrayal of a grown man with the mind of a seven year old. None of the characters come of seeming like real people so much as types. Even his daughter (the annoying Fanning) is more HOllywood precociousness about her than real-life childlike qualities. More time seems to have been spent on product placement that developing the story and characters. The saving grace is the slight ambiguity of the ending; I thought for sure they'd settle for the cheap, easy ending just as they settled for the cheap and easy everywhere else in the film."
1,One of the worst movies I've ever seen,"This movie exploits common stereotypes about mentally challenged people rendering a stick figure world filled with simplifications, distortions and outright falsehoods about the reality of living with mental disabilities. The acting is horrid and the plot is downright stupid. The movie is also filled with cheesy gimmicks to engineer a compassionate, emotion-filled response from the audience that would have been avant garde for the 1950's. The ending, with a nauseating dance number with flowery music was simply worthy of a missile attack on the director/writers. This movie is ultimately empty of validity. This movie is a fraud. Rent it first before you buy it. I guarantee you will end up not buying it, or asking for your rental fee back...."
2,Manipulation at its best.,"I didn't want to see this movie when it was out in the theater because I thought judging by the movie trailer that it was a movie that was designed to pull at your heart strings. And I was right. The whole 'all you need is love' is a nice song, but doesn't work in the real world. Unfortunately we all need more than just love to get by in this world. I see parents professing their love for the children on the news. Telling the camera crew that their child would never hurt anyone-they didn't shoot, kill, or do any of the things the police is accusing them of. Loving parents are pulling their hair out over drug-addicted children or just plain bad as hell. It takes more than love to raise a child. End of story. The two stars are for Dakota Fanning and Michelle Pfeiffer-good acting chops. Penn I thought tried a little too hard."
5,"""Nothing's gonna change my world...""","I am Sam starring Sean Penn, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Dakota Fanning is a celebration of the human heart. I absolutely adore this film, and boy Fanning really steals the show, this was her first big performance. Penn and Pfeiffer have great chemistry and you can feel their pain and anguish and both of them come from different backgrounds, but equally they share heartaches just like everyone else. This is one of those films that tug at your heartstrings, so real, so candid, and truly captivating from beginning to end. I also recommend the soundtrack to the film, it contains great covers of Beatles songs. Enjoy!"
5,cinematic excellence,"This film is excellent in many ways, including casting, interactivedialogue, cinematography, emotional presence, and plot. Kudos to theentire staff of movie-makers who turned this one out.[...]"
2,Emotionally moving but misguided,"In what real world situation does anyone really think a man functioning on the level of a 7 year old, should raise a child? I would never leave one of my children in the full time care of a 7 year old for even an hour.This is a wonderful movie. The acting is superb and it pulls your heartstrings deeply. It really does cause you to lose grip with reality and side with the mentally challenged, Sam. But in the end, nobody should be fooled into believing this nicey nice, pc bull. in the real world a child should never be raised by a person this impaired and Sam who claims to love the child, should have taken the offer at permanent foster family with visitation rights."
4,Penn was fantastic,I never thought I would like a film with Sean Penn in it. But I was very surprised to see Penn do so well. His performance made this movie.
3,Blu-ray made by Ais (that's Alliance in Canada),"...and if you've purchased Alliance products before, you already know what I'm about to say.I guess we should feel blessed that New Line didn't produce these like they did the DVD-Video issue.And I guess I should also feel blessed that I knew I was buying this Ais / Alliance issue when I purchased it, and not have it swapped out by an Amazon seller when I would be thinking I'm buying MGM or CBS or Paramount products, which is also becoming typical behavior (especially with Twilight: New Moon and Twilight: Eclipse these days.Video: AVC (but low, averaging approx 18 Mbps).Audio: 5.1 DTS HD Master Audio 5.1 is here but the disc defaults to 5.1 Dolby when loaded and played.Subtitles / Closed Captioning: NONE - No English, French, Spanish... nothing.So, typical half-assed release by Alliance - or is it Ais (to hide the name Alliance these days)?"
1,Sean Penn ist good but annoying,There`s one big mistake in this picture: The character Sam Dawson (Sean Penn) is just too stupid. Nobody would give this guy a child.
5,"Magical, life-affirming","This book's beauty of language and imagery simply takes one's breath away. Its heroes are understated, its rights of passage unpretentious, its moments of insight so profound that they stop you dead in your tracks. At the end, its emotional impact is almost overwhelming. A book which conveys what it is to be human, this is a fully-formed work from a fully-formed writer. Ilse asks at the end, ""Who'll tell the story of the children?"" Monique Charlesworth has - and how."
1,Appallingly Written,"Rarely have I had to abandon a book but within 28 pages I thought either this was either some sort of literally joke or I needed to read this book upside down. The killer blow came with the following turgid and ridiculous description of a meal time: ""Nicholai made fortifications with his potatoes,forked waves into a gravy moat.Caraway seed men attacked and defended; the sausage battering ram won through.Madga had saved a portion of fruit compote for him. She ladled cream.He plunged a spoon through the white lake to the red current depths,then swirled the two into a Catherine wheel."" Good grief. Dont bother-if you want to read a story of children in WW2 then there have got to be better options than this completely overcooked tripe"
3,Old battery,"I got this watch in blue about ten months ago, and it stopped after two months after receiving it. Although it's an old model, they could make sure they send out good watches with longer battery life."
4,One of the better Slovene language books,"Many of the texts meant for teaching the Slovene language are difficult to work with. This one is the easiest I have seen, considering that Slovene is a difficult language, on par with Russian."
5,Great strategys...but Meston should have gotten top billing.,"There are 4 books in this series and all 4 are worth what little you can purchase them for nowadays. There are 10-15 games covered in-depth in each book and most of them are covered from beginning to end. I've actually emailed the co-author, Zach Meston, and he was actually the workhorse behind this series of books, with DeMaria taking most of the credit. There is actually an interview posted on the web where he discusses this.Anyways, these 4 books are a must for someone trying to beat NES games. They put the Rovin books to shame."
1,Cover Your Ears!,"The worst album in the history of ROCK! So wimpy it may appeal to your parents. From Beginning to end, consistantly bad. Should be in the guiness book of records for the worst album cover of all time. The ""Songs"" are just as, if not, worse than the cover illustration. A complete, COMPLETE waste of time and money. The Farmers almanac is more interesting. Did I mention its not that good?"
1,ASS ISLE UUUM!,"There's not one good song on this album.Could it be their worst ever?I'll have to listen to Animalize to make up my mind,but this is really awful."
1,I'll tell YOU what's funny about this album,Gene simmons looks like MiriamPaul Stanley looks like the lead singer from the CureBruce Kulick looks like he went to a CHEAP plastic surgeonEric carr (RIP)Overall a stupid realease just like there other 80s albums.Next review in store Kiss Animalize
1,uh no tears are ffffffaaaaaaaaaallllllliiiiiinnnnnnnnnnggggg,That is a really funny song piss are most likely the worlds relentless jerk offs all they think about is sex sex sex.No wonder at interviews they struggle to breath they have blown their load piss thats the womens job.
4,"good,but not the best","this was a good album.it holds some of the greatest songs ever written in the 80s like ""Tears Are Falling"",""Anyway You Slice It"",""King of the Mountain"" and ""I'm Alive"".Although songs like ""Radar for Love"" were a disapointment.But I dont really know why people put this album down.one of the greatest Kiss lineups started here.Bruce Kulice is one of the best guitarests to ever play with Kiss.Hiss solo for ""Tears Are Falling"" will prove that to you.And all in all,this may not be their best,but its a must-have!"
4,The 2nd best Kiss Album of the 80's,This is the first Kiss album I ever bought. This is the 2nd best Kiss album of the 80's (the first being Creatures of the Night). I love the songs Tears are Falling and Who wants to be Lonely.
4,"Good, but not Great","The mid-80s weren't always that great for KISS. Hair-metal was raging, and KISS jumped on its bandwagon. This album best shows that aspect. There are some true classics on here. UH! All Night and Who Wants To Be Lonely fit in that list. Bruce Kulick was a top-notch guitar player, and Eric Carr was a true phenom. Paul was in his element, screaming those songs. However, it seems like Gene was out of it, as most of his tracks (Any Way You Slice It, Trial By Fire) are largely forgettable. He managed to wake up a little for Secretly Cruel, but he just seems to lack any passion. (Too busy making movies at the time?) Still, his lack of fire can't hurt this album too much, as it's still required listening for true KISS freaks."
3,Kiss- Da eighties hair metal edition. three and a half stars!,"No, it ain't da best Kiss from da eighties (i would say that was Creatures of The Night) but it wasn't the worst ( IMO, Crazy Nights and Hot In The Shade were the biggest turds Kiss released. I disagree wit da guy who sez it's Unmasked, which I thought was pretty cool) My faves on here include Uh! All Night, Who Wants To Be Lonely, Tears Are Falling, Any Way You Slice It,Love's a Deadly Weapon,Radar Of Love and Trial By Fire. Had dis on cassette back in da day."
3,KISS 80s Version,"KISS in the 80s was often critizized for being unfocused, with Gene Simmons sort of backing down from being the vocal point of the group. IMO, their 80s period every album only has one or two noteworthy songs. That being said, this is a typical KISS album, with Eric Carr on drums and Bruce Kulick lead guitar. This is with their makeup off. Key trackd are King of the Mountain and Tears are Falling."
4,Out of the Asylum; The MTV Era,"I really like this record. I think ALL of Paul's songs are great. The album is more rockin' and fun than Animalize. And Gene's songs aren't bad. Paul's ""King of the Mountain"" is cool; obviously ""Tears are Falling"" is a Kiss classic that recently got new life by being played on the Rock the Nation tour. ""Who Wants to Be Lonely"" I've always liked and I think it's like the ""Sure Know Something"" of the 80's. My favorite and I still think it's a cool song is ""Uh! All Night"". Gene's tunes are good this time especially ""Trial By Fire"" and ""Secretly Cruel"". But ""Anyway you Slice It"" and ""Love's a Deadly Weapon"" are silly, but they at least sound cool and are fun and they rock hard. Hey,it was the 80's...and Kiss was trying to compete with Bon Jovi and Poison. Let's not forget how they owned Dial MTV from like 1984-1990. It was really cool to tune in and see Kiss on TV all the time."
5,The best KISS album!,"If you don't have it buy it!Eric Carr is absolutely the best drummer of the three KISS drummers and Bruce Kulick is better than Ace,Tommy,Mark S.T John and Vinnie Vincent playing guitar and Gene and Paul is here as usual with their absolutely their best material in their carrer."
3,Asylum a underated classic!,Asylum rocks apart from what others might say. Kiss ruled in the 80's. This was one of my favorites when I got it. 3 1/2 stars at best. Yes and it is better than Destroyer. A classic 80's Kiss album. I loved Gene's hair here in this era. Not kidding it ruled. Asylum should be appreciated more. Good moments in Kisstory!
3,KISS Asylum,Not one of their better albums. The music does not have the raw edge to it as their earlier albums do.
2,How can you say it is good enough???,"I think on me as one of the GOOD KissManiac. But, you know, my brain is not p***** and I can (still) separate nice music and strong rock from s*** music and pink rock. This is the WORST Kiss album: just a couple of hot moments through ""Tears are falling"". If you are not a Kiss fan try with ""Rock and Roll Over"", ""Destroyer"", ""Lick it Up"" or any of the ""Alive"" almbums. Or maybe the last one: ""Carnival of Souls"" (really GOOOD)."
2,This Is NOT KISS....,"This is Gene Simmons, Paul Stanley, The Late Great Eric Carr & a hired gun, who is trying to fill Ace's shoes, using the Kiss name to make money. Anyone who had the original poster booklet from the vinyl version of Kiss ""Alive"" taped up on their wall knows what I'm talking about. This is a average hard rock record at best.Any die-hard Kiss fan who has this album on their shelf, like me, bought it to to keep their Kiss collection complete and that's it.Virtually unlistenable if played after ""Alive"", ""Destroyer"" or any other 70's era Kiss album."
3,Better than Animalize,"Still derivative 80s pop-metal, but marginally better than Animalize. Buy only if you're a true-blue KISS fan."
3,not bad for eighties KISS....,"The 80's were not exactly kind to Kiss...This album shows the band doing the best they could with what they had going for them at the time. Typical ""glam-hard-rock-metal"" was only truly avoided by the likes of Iron Maiden. ""Asylum"" has a couple good tracks, a few fair tunes, and a couple throwaways."
2,Gene on lne 1.,"'King of the Mountàin' is Paul's best song since 'Love Gun' and damn if 'Tears' doesn't score a solid artstic hit with 'Who Wants to be Lonely?' and 'Love's a Deadly Weapon' gettng points for effort. Erc puts more of a stamp on this and Bruce does (or is it Jean Beavoir?) a good Gene bass impression; Gene's auto-pilot when it omes to, you know, actually making the records approaching critical mass. And Paul ends up throwing in the towel too, the remaining tracks on here...I'm still cleaning the chunks of my walls that this record spewed out of the speakers. It's like that feeling you get when you watch four hours of daytime TV while pounding glazed doughnuts."
3,KISS Hair rock!,"Probably, Asylum is one of the albums farther from the band's original sound. However, the compositional quality suited to the band at times and songs like ""King of the Mountain"", ""Tears are fallin ',"" ""Who wants to be lonely"" or ""Trial by Fire,"" will not disappoint to you!"
3,Glam Kiss at it's best,Great Kiss Glam albam here...I like a few songs on this albam and I love Gene's hair during this era...underrated Kiss record get it if you don't got it...
2,Take his crackpipe away!!,That guy that said Asylum was the definitive Kiss album is out of his mind. This was one of their worst albums and to call it definitive is an insult. Dressed To Kill and Destroyer are definitive albums. They didn't have one release in the 80's that was worth even 3 stars.
2,Has Some Moments,"This release is a bit more commericial than Animalize and Lick it Up. All the songs have energy, but most of them still are forgettable. The best songs are ""Tears Are Falling,"" ""Uh! All Night,"" and ""Who Wants to be Lonely."" Those three are actually good songs, but unfortunately the rest of the songs don't match up. I give this album 2.5 stars."
4,blues at dawn,"Meat...this is a good one-especially Bloodshot, Revelator, Mud Pie(which needs to be longer), and Magdalena. Ian was just here June 30th-July 1st at the highway 99 blues club, he was amazing-the growls, the vibe-reminiscent of tom waits-and very provocative live, if he comes back-will see him again, and again, and again."
3,Could be more useful,"This is an interesting book, and the pictures are, as one might expect, lovely. Having two writers alternating commentary likewise is an appealing feature.Readers interested in a comprehensive list of edible/eaten insects (and similar little, exoskeletal things) would do well to look elsewhere. I live in one of the countries covered here, and most of the edible insects most often eaten here are not mentioned at all. (For Japan, see ""Tanoshii Konchu Ryouri"" [ISBN:978-4828414409], in Japanese only.)Those of use who actually eat insects would like to have seen more information on recipes, preparation, and how to obtain the foodstuffs mentioned here, but anyone else interested in the topic will likely find this book good, though written from (as the writers acknowledge) a strongly Western point of view."
1,Worst movie on Amazon.,I watched the movie once and threw it in the trash. Maybe it was an extreme edited version. The movie I received didn't deserve any stars.
4,A great decision,"Finally - Waiting On A Sunny Day is released as a single. I've always thought it should be the first one, as Rising and Lonesome Day are not (at least for me, tho' I've grown fond of them too) the strongest tracks from a very strong record. But Waitin' - that's vintage Bruce, a very catchy song, and a very healing one. Rock'n'roll at its best. I'm waiting for Columbia to release Nothing Man (for me the best track on the album) as a single. But here, on Waiting, it is Neil's guitar that adds to the moment. And you should see a video."
1,Inaccurate Information,"This book contains inaccurate information. Australia, as a continent, is made up of the countries of New Zealand, Australia and Papua New Guinea, as well as a number of smaller islands. This book states that the continent of Australia is made up of just one country - the country of Australia."
5,"A wonderful book, very informative, a must read!","It Takes More Than Love is a great book that opens up a wealth of information to anyone caring for an aging adult or for someone who wants to learn more about the area. This book will help anyone with the day to day care for an aged adult. It will also explain other methods that you may not have thought of on your own. It is extremelly helpful for someone who doesn't know a great deal about caring.This is a wonderful book, including not only information but pictures and diagrams to help reenforce it. Again this book really helped me, and would be a great read for anyone now in the area or exploring the area of caring for an aging adult."
5,This book has everything you need to know!,"Caregiving is a hot topic in books and magazines these days, but usually only a couple of aspects of caregiving are addressed. This book covers everything: what to do day-to-day; how to care for yourself, too; how to deal with simple health issues; and how to find support outside your home. The presentation is so accessible--charts, lists, illustrations--so you can go right to the information you need on any given day. It's full of other people's stories, which made me feel like we all go through a lot of the same things. It helps you do what you need to do and at the same time recognize when you're taking on too much, and what to do then. The book also discusses more medical topics (incontinence, falling, foot care, medicines) in a way that's easy to read and makes problems less intimidating. It Takes More than Love will help both the caregiver and the care recipient live better lives."
3,cmon house fans where are you?,this compo is worth buying for the song Live your life with me by Corrina Joseph (produced with help from the basement jaxx)!!
4,"Here, There and Yonder","This is a reprint of the book ""Here, There and Yonder"" by Robert W Brinson originally published in 1982. Thomas Brinson (b 1610) came to America in the mid 1600s and the book tracks the descendants of his grandson Cason Brinson (ca 1693). Cason came to Pamlico County, NC in the early 1700s. Many of his desendants are still in that area. Some of his descendants were among the first American families to enter Texas about 1821. The book has 900 pages. The author had a heart attack and died before he could do a final check of the publishers draft copy. As a result there are some errors that he would have corrected but all in all this is a great book on the desendants of Cason Brinson."
1,One Big Piece of Crap,"After seeing that this was an ""acoustic tribute"", I decided to check out the amazon page for the cd... I never even bought it because the songs were terrible. Anytime one band wants to cover another band, they should make sure they are acutally talented. The singer in this garbage sounds like he is straining his voice. The rapper sounds like he loses his breath a couple of times and the songs sound crappy. I was hoping someone would come out with an acoustic Linkin Park album. I would prefer it be Linkin Park... But if they never do and someone else decides they want to do it, please bring some talent to the studio so we can all sleep better at night... Thank You."
2,idiot music saves this CD from 1 star,"This CD is.... I can't even say what I want to say without getting in trouble by the law! ;) Anyway... if you want to listen to Linkin Park, just get the real CDs. The ONLY fair song is idiot music, other tracks are horrible"
1,No no seriously... this one sucks,"Not only does this sound like it was recorded in a bathroom stall, but whoever's singing sounds horribly strained. I sounds like crappy acapella - without any semblance of Harmony. Digital mastering and production does a lot for Linkin Park, and talent does quite a bit too. These guys have neither. I've heard horrible music before, but this may be the worst."
1,total misrepresentation of product offered,"I thought I found a used, or slightly defective product. I've used Amazon literally DOZENS and DOZENS of times from everything from books to electronics. I typed in the search that I needed dog houses. Up popped this selection with a very confusing title. but a picture of a large dog in a large dog HOUSE. When I saw the $20 price, I assumed based on my past experience w/ Amazon that maybe there was a color defect, overstock situation, cash flow need, etc. I ordered the dog house and got a dog DOOR instead. Very misleading, and very expensive to send back as the freight will eat up most of the money I will get back less the restocking fee.BEWARE OF THIS WEBSITE. I HAVE NEVER GIVEN A POOR RATING BEFORE...."
1,Read Carefully,The was very misleading. I wish they would explain what you are to get a little better before you buy it. A waste of my money.
4,Region Oriented and Unique,"I throughly enjoyed the poetry in this delightful book. I was especially moved by the poem ""Fallen heroes"" because I have two family members who have served in the war on terror. The poem expressed many of the feelings we all shared on 9-11.As a mother, I was also moved by the touching poems about the death of the young daughter. So poignant!As a southerner, I could well relate to the fried chicken, the porch swings and the rocking chairs. A very short poem entitled ""A Pebble"" held a special message for me. Every family must have a ""rock.""There were many experiences, thoughts and emotions expressed in the poetry in this book. I highly recommend it!"
1,Is this even Jane Austen?,"The book was poorly written. The story was absurd, hard to believe it was Jane Austen. I Couldn't finish it."
2,Love & Friendship,Didn't like the format...too hard to follow. Her other books had an easier story line to follow. Would not recommend it.
2,Good for Making a study of writing developement,but not very good for pleasant reading. Difficult to follow the events or what happens to the characters and absolutely unbelievable characters and situations.
2,Love & Friendship,Interesting book - quick read. Wish she could have lived longer to give us more of her works. Austen if one of my favorite writers.
3,It's ok,"It's a bunch of small letters or stories, some of them don't make any sense but there was a couple pretty good ones. Sarcastic at times, as the title says it's ok."
2,THOUGHT IT WOULD BE MUCH MORE INTERESTING,LOVE AND FRIENDSHIP A COLLECTION OF LETTERS. COULDN'T HOLD MY INTEREST. DID MANAGE TO GET ABOUT HALF WAY THROUGH WITH MUCH EFFORT.
3,Not her best,Not her best ... I'm a big Jane Austen fan but this book definitely fell short of what she accomplished.
4,An odd miscellany,"This version kept most of the original mistakes in the writing, which produces a somewhat confusing collection. This book has many of Austen' s early or unfinished writings. Many are incomplete, and therefore incomprehensible, due to the nature of this book. Many of the letters are entertaining. As always, Austen 's writing is full of wit, wisdom, and beauty. I have not finished reading all of the stories, but the letters I have read brought back vivid memories of reading her larger works. Her classic style is always enjoyable to read, and this collection shows the beginnings of that talent. In many of the letters one will find hints of other stories. You will see a bit more into the life of Jane Austen, and notice how her talent grew. Some of these were like the ""rough draft"" inspirations for her other books."
1,NOT A BOOK,"THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO B A BOOK I COULD READ ON MY PHONE, BUT THIS IS NOT A BOOK AT ALL."
1,Hard to believe this is Jane Austen,"It is no wonder this is not generally known to be a work of Jane Austen. I dare say she may have known people like the writers of the letters or she would not have been able to write as she did, but they are not the sort of people I care to know or know about."
3,Love Jane Austin,Love and Friendship was one of Jane Austins works that I was least familiar with. I lvoe having it handy to read while waiting for an appointment. IT is easy to come in and out of the story. It loads well.
4,Great,"Wonderful, love the whole collection and would definitely buy it again. The price was the thing that I loved. Jane Austen is something everyone should want to read."
2,disappointing.,"It's interesting for a fan to read to see how far J A progressed, but these are indeed teenage/ young works which were not published for a reason in the first place."
2,Disappointing....,"Didn't like the ""letter to letter"" format, and could not get into it....might have been good, being Jane Austen, but could not get into it."
4,Who says all the trecks are the same?,A collection with all the different captins- what a good idea! Now you get to experience them all. Classic episodes from all the series. Maybe not the best choices to show the actors at their finest- but still well worth a peek. Voyager is my fav. Treck and although this isn't the best episode this is a good way for other people to see all the series. Kate Mulgrew is as good as ever- so don't pull her down. As the series progress her acting gts a little less wooden- but hey this is her debue episode! Wonder about the other trecks well have a peek at this video to see what youre missing.
3,Excellent resource for starters but....,I picked this book up a little over a year ago and it has served to open up a whole new world to me. The writing is unpretentious and accessible - unlike the NPR guide. My main criticism of the book is the absence of Sergei Rachmoninoff - this results in the book losing two stars in its rating.
4,very helpful for beginners!,"I knew next to nothing about classical music, but wanted to add some to my music collection. Browsing through the classical section in stores got overwhelming in a hurry. This book helped me a great deal to narrow down what CDs to look for. It's easy to read and understand, includes bios of the 50 most popular/important composers and which of their works are the most well-known, popular, or historically important. Also some suggestions on CDs to buy for various works. You don't need to read the chapters on musical history or instruments, but they are interesting and informative.This same author has a similar book on opera, too. I'm not as interested in building a collection of opera, but I plan on buying the book just to read and educate myself a little more on opera.Highly recommended as an easy introduction to classical music, or if you're looking to build or expand your classical libary."
5,Excellent book for beginners,"You get a short history of the 50 greatest composers along with recommendations on which pieces of music to purchase. It is very well written. Also, at the beginning of the book the author explains things such as the difference between a sonata and a concerto and many other ""basics"". Highly recommended."
3,Informative but rigid,"This book presents a wealth of factual information and the author has obviously done a tremendous amount of research on the topic, the problem I have is with the presentation. The author is preoccupied with assigning numerical rankings to the composers and their works and with placing them in a rigid hierarchy: ""It is exeedingly bad form to lower any of the seven Demigods to the level of Artists of a High Order, the 21-to-50 group...It is not authorized to drop the 11-to-20 composers from The List. They may be demoted."" This type of mathematical juggling may be appealing to beginners approaching Classical music from the sciences, but not for those intimately involved in the arts. Ultimately Goulding comes across as someone who wishes to classify and systematize the body of classical music rather than someone who appreciates it for it's pure art and beauty."
1,Bad Customer Service,"Not only did I not like the cd, when I tried to return it I had very bad customer service. It will be quite some time before I do any business with Amazon, if ever."
4,Pleasant book,"I liked this book.The dragons are lively and each of them has a unique personality. The story line flows well from the previous book. I am wondering what is missing, though. It does not compare, in fact to Harry Potter, or even Eragon. Maybe it's because the plot is not as rich and complex. It also would be nicer to get to discover more and more of the characters as the story unfolds. I still look forward to reading the other volumes, though."
5,This Grandma Loves This Dragon Series!,"The Last Dragon Chronicles by Chris D'Lacey is a wonderful Fantasy series about clay dragons that are brought to life by their creator. I love how each one has it's own personality and special magical abilities.""When college student David Rain begins rooming at the home of Liz Pennykettle and her 11-year-old daughter, he becomes aware of a variety of unusual happenings connected to the clay dragons that Liz creates and sells"".The story is very engaging from the first page of the first book-The Fire Within,through this book 'Icefire',and I'm so glad that I have the third book 'Firestar'ready to start.All the characters are wonderfully developed including the dragons and even the Pennykettle's tabby cat-Bonnington!Very highly recommended for all lovers of fantasy fiction."
3,A fun read,"Icefire is the second book in the Fire Star trilogy. It's a fun read although it is a kid's book. They set it at 7th grade and up, but I'd say more like 4th grade and up. The story is unique and the characters are very interesting. There are lots of things to learn about, the Artic, polar bears and, of course, myths and legends; or are they real?"
4,much better than the first one (Fire Within),"I was a little bit disappointed by the first book (The Fire Within) since the cover promised us a story about dragons but none was seen. However, I really enjoyed the style and the spirit among the characters. That alone drove me to order (Icefire) and I have to say the story really starts here not in the first book.The Fire within was almost about squirrels, which made it kind of silly for me as an adult reader. But in Icefire you get to know a lot about the dragons and the bears. The plot is much more intense and thrilling, new characters appear and the story broadens a lot.You may notice that many things were mentioned in The Fire Within and you get confused about some names and details but you'll be safe when you continue so don't worry about it."
4,Icefire,"I have alot of favorite books. This book, however, was an all time favorite. My all time favorite book was Icefire, by Chris D'Lacey. This book is second, of three, of a science fiction series. This book is about a tenant, David Rain, and his landlady's family. His landlady, Elizabeth Pennykettle, is a potter. She makes clay dragons and sells them in a market. Mrs. Pennykettle made a special dragon, for David, named Gadzooks. David is in his second year of college and one of his teachers is having an essay contest. Lucy, Liz's daughter, made David a wishing dragon. David, curious of this, wishes to see the Icefire. Once he does this, Liz's ""Aunt"" shows up. As she begins to settle in, she turns the house upsde down. You will have to rread the book to find out what happens next. This book was, to me, a very good book. I think this because it is very addicting to keep reading it. Also, there is another book in the series, Fire Star. These books are best suitable for any age group."
4,An Interesting Dragon Story,"Ice fire is a great book. The story is about David who is the main character, and about the secrets of the Artic. The Sphyie, an evil person who wants to rule the world, makes Liz create a real dragon. Liz is the creator of clay dragons that hold the power of a fire tear. Then all these problems start to occur. The dragons start to turn to stone. The Sphyie makes Zanna, a Goth girl who helps David, scared, and David sinks into the ground. David have the special power to visualize how things are and to see the bears of the Artic. Dr. Berstong holds the secrets of the Artic, and he helps David discover him auma (the special power in you). Lorel the bear of the Artic will tell the secrets of the Artic and the dragons. All the Artic legends will be revealed."
3,Neo's Review,Icefire is the second book in The Last Dragon Chronicles is immensely better that its predeccessor The Fire Within. If you liked The Fire Within you may or may not like this book. Icefire is much better paced and has a storyline unlike The Fire Within which didn't really have any. The ending is great and leaves you wanting to read the third book in the Chronicles.
5,Much better,"This book 2 in the trilogy, is a much more rounded book. It is about the dragons and has more action than that first book. The story concentrates on the household when, due to a foolish wish, a strange and strict lady turns up at the Pennykettle house one day and takes over.An exciting read for your child or YA reader."
2,IceFire by Chris D'Lacey,"Book was not in the condition that I thought it would be. It was well worn out. Binding of book broken down, pages are pulling away from binding. Was not real happy with the condition of this book. Was labeled in ""good"" condition when I was searching for the book, when it should of been labeled different! Next time I will be more selective when it comes to purchasing books and will for sure will not purchase from this seller again!"
4,Rivetting performances,"Excellent performances by the entire cast make this film well above average. Honestly, I don't know why this film didn't succeed at the box office. It has everything! Great acting by Nicholson, Caine, Dorff & Davis. Treachery, double crossing, action... you name it, it's there. Judy Davis' car accident was done very realistically. Stephen Dorff holds his own against the 2 legends Nicholson & Caine. Where did the film go wrong? I mean, why wasn't it a hit? Can't figure it out."
4,"Blood, wine, and a really great story","Blood and Wine follows a very disfunctional family, played by Jack Nicholson, the wonderful Judy Davis, and Stephen Dorff. Also along for the ride are Michael Caine, and even a young Jennifer Lopez, who is actually a good actress.The story follows Alex (Nicholson), who is a wine seller, but he also has a bit of a larceny problem as well. So as he's selling expensive wine to rich people, he's also stealing their jewels. And he's also cheating on his wife (Davis) with the beautiful nanny (J.Lo). And his stepson (Dorff) absolutely hates him. And his partner in crime (Caine) is an ailing psychotic. And that's just the background to the story.There are plenty of good twists and turns in this thriller. The direction is great, as is the acting from everyone. If you're looking for a good thriller that you've never heard of, check this one out. You won't be disappointed."
4,"Thriller, with depth...","After the usual plethora of Hollywood murder mysterys in the 80s, this suprises with a number of twists that leave even the most jaded viewer suprised with the result. However the movie is dragged from B-Movie world by an outstanding double act between Jack Nicolas and Micheal Caine...a casting from hell that works so amazingly well. Worth watching just to see the two masters on the same screen."
4,good movie,I had never heard of this movie until I was searching through Amazon one day. Being a Jack Nicholson fan I thought why not buy it. Glad I did.
3,Utter tripe from a good director,"I like Rafelson's movies, but his heart was really not in this one. It's a by-the-numbers heist/chase movie, with the occasional stab at some sort of emotional resonance, all of which fall flat thanks to a very weak script. From the opening scene, the combination of violence and ridiculousness is established: a pair of pretty young men uses a pick-up truck to drag a bull shark to the shore of a Florida beach then kills it with a shark stick to the head. From then it's father-stepson rivalry over an absurdly overdressed Cuban nanny/golddigger (J-Lo, about as dramatically effective as the dead shark), a diamond necklace as the McGuffin, and far more blood than wine. The wine, one of the reasons I wanted to see the movie, is perfunctory background color in three scenes. Skip this one unless you think ""The two Jakes"" was a cinematic masterpiece."
1,"been there, done that, seen that ... oh so many times before","I assume all the rave reviews are because Bob Rafelson and Jack Nicholson and Michael Caine have such high reputations, but really, this is a very tired old ""noir"" story that we've all seen 100s of times before. Rafelson says in the commentary that he wanted to update his tale for the 1990s by emphasizing the ""greed"" aspect. Huh? Every noir film is about greed.Yeah, there are lots of twists and turns and betrayals, but it's all so very predicatable because all noir films have the same betrayals.I was mostly bored by this film. I only got it because it had Jennifer Lopez, but her role was disappointingly small. Not a tiny role, but not so big either.Anyway, if you've only seen 200 or 300 noir films, so that you're still surprised and tense over the same old, same old plot points (the usual betrayals motivated by greed and sex), then I guess you may as well see this one too."
1,Two hours I'll never get back.,"This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The only thing that stopped me from demanding my money back at the end was the fact that I saw it in a free sneak preview.By the end of movie you don't like any of the characters and you don't care what happens to them, even the ones that started out sympathetic and likable. The third time Jack Nicholson's character gets beaten with his own golf clubs you're torn between wishing they'd just kill him already and wishing they'd kill you instead so you don't have to sit through anymore of this crap.Save your time and your money, turn around and walk away from this one. I wish I had."
1,Public Enemy Wannabe's!!!,This CD is tha biggest B.S. I done heard in a long time!2 versions exactly tha same of tha same song???These ppl R tryin to be all pro-black/political and all that but tha thing is u need to be intellegente to write those kind of rhymes not racist; which is what these clowns do! And their music video completely contradicts its self!*Pimp tha system with Westside Connection; not these fool!!!DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CR*P!PEACE
5,solid album great replay value,yo this album is banging all the way through from the first track to the last....RBG yall....
2,it has some moments but this is just kinda there,"when Compared to Let's get free"" this Album just kinda hits you once&then you almost forget about it.the Subject Matter is on point but the Producton&vibe just seems dense in other areas&there isn't that One cut that just gets at me like they did in the past."
2,Falling off the wagon,"Dead prez opened my eyes a few years ago when I heard Lets Get Free. Amazing Hip-Hop. I awaited this album for a long long time. And when I heard it, I wanted to puke. The positive messages of community and freedom were gone, replaced by odes to getting ""Fu*ked Up"" and drive bys of Police stations.These guys have disenfranchised themselves. The Revolution will be one of mind and soul, not one of guns and money, the tools of the capitalists. LEts get Free understood this. RBG is a sell out tool, and I hope it doesn't sell worth at all. They need to fire their Jay-Z-esque beat writers and get back to their hip hop roots. Even the rhymes sound more mainstream.Dissapointing, but I'll still go see them live, hoping to hear some old stuff.Go get their first album, but let this one fester. Hopefully they'll get the idea."
3,average at best,"Dead Prez's latest was touted as one of the most anticipated hip hop albums of the year, but sad to say I was disappointed. First shocker was when I put the cd in the stereo and saw that it's only 45 minutes long. But maybe 45 minutes of ok beats and rhymes is better than 78 minutes of substandard rhymes and useless skits. Standout tracks include the ""hidden"" track 20 and ""w-4"" telling a familiar story of struggle from a raw perspective."
3,Very censored!,I hope you guys that gave this a bad review understand that this album has been censored. There are 2 songs that have been left off for reasons unknown. I first downloaded this album last September and was amazed. The intro was changed as was the beginning of W4 when the guy was talking about doubting there is a God. Be kind to DPZ. They tried to get off of Sony to release the album the way they wanted it but Sony wouldn't let them and censored it.
2,cheesy,I am happy with the transaction. The book arrived in goood condition in a reasonable time. The story was a bit disappointing. I like books of faith but in this one the religion was a bit heavy handed and cheesy rather then convincing.
5,His Greatest Song,"His rendition of ""Boy from Nowhere "" will be his signature song. Been a fan since he first came on the scene, attended many concerts and have a lot of favorites but this one is the best. The words mean a lot to me and I am sure many people who hear it will feel the same. This song sums up the man, he sings it like he lived it. Go out and buy this cd."
4,Very Pleased,"The CD was just as it said it was. The shipping times were more than acceptable to me. ""I'll be back!"""
5,Tom Jones Is The Best!,I love Tom Jones so I love this album. The man is a great entertainer. Buy this album and any other one you can get your hands on. He's also great in person. I've seen him 3 times. Always a great show.
5,"A fantastic,live record of Old blue eyes,from1974","There's no question,Sinatra was cool.There will never be another performer that will come close to him.This live recording,from 1974,is a must have for all of Old blue Eyes fans.My favorite number,""I get a kick out of you,"" is one cut I can't stop playing.I bought this tape at the record store for under 4 bucks,but I would have paid alot more to hear this fantastic live, Main Event."
5,Delightful documentary,"Mozart had a fascination with Turkey as he composed several works related to this country, like his piano sonata known as ""A La Turca"", a violin concerto, etc. The Abduction from The Seraglio is a German Singspiel filled with Turkish themes and comic scenes especially by Osmin. The arias for Konstanze and Belmonte are just beautiful. Pedrillo and Blonde sing flawlesly and The Pasha is powerful but he never uses it to conquer Constanze, who is very much in love with Belmonte."
2,Not my preference,It may be my fault but I expected the pens [at 0.7 mm] to have a finer ink point. If one tends to write small the pen is less than ideal. I have found no defects otherwise and the bonus marker is handy.
1,Not recommended,"This is the first Panasonic item, in 30 years of happily buying their products, I've ever criticized. Why?1. Support staff at Panasonic don't speak clearly; Panasonic's outsourced their 800- number to the planet of mumblers.2. They refer all callers to the selling dealer. Does Amazon provide support if you have a problem with something bought from Amazon?3. User Guide is cryptic, unclear and written in Japlish. It uses unidentified icons in the instructions with no textual explanation (i.e., the One-touch Dialling and Personal Speed Dialling (sic) instructions on page 2). Naturally, said instructions don't work.In summary, Panasonic telephones are NOT recommended. I'm saddened, because I've been happily installing Panasonic phone systems for the past 30 years, ever since I left telco, but they've cheapened essential support to the point where I cannot recommend it any more."
5,Great hoodie,I bought this hoodie sweatshirt for my teen-age son. It's very well made and heavy yet soft. It's a good thing because he wears it nearly every day. Really great buy.
3,Cyber Wars appreciation,I saw a preview of Cyber Wars while viewing another DVD. The visuals looked good so I ordered it. I was not disappointed.
1,Like watching a BAD high school play. A real Cyber Bore. ZZZZZZzzzz,"You know, the really bad ones you have to sit through because your son or daughter has a part in it? Whoever this Dash what's-her-name actress is, I believe could be voted as one of the worse performances in a stupid, inane, boring and lifeless film. I mean, she really sucks. Special effects - laughable. I think I remember seeing the old man in TRON. And the little dude in the bar from ""The Blade Runner."" The interaction between characters really does border on truly amateurish. Someone mentioned a 4 million dollar budget? Sounds about right. Don't waste tour time or money on this clunker."
3,"""LEGACY!""","Yes, SHE knew her craft - and knew it well!JOAN CRAWFORD! Always a Star, always an inspiration, who do we have today who can walk into a Studio facility and instantly know what would or would not work - Costume, make-up [created for her], script [the required ""telephone scene"", etc.]? The unmistakable voice - never quite duplicated.It wasn't just about the glitz, it took hard work to get there. [She was also directed by Spielberg!]This is a seldom seen, but great story about misapplied middle-aged love. Quite a few casting surprises too - Cliff Robertson as the love object, Vera Miles [pre-Psycho] and more! Great theme song - Nat King Cole, perfect for anytime!Director Bob Aldrich went on to do ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane"" with her [and who was that ""other"" star?]This VHS version is quite good, but Fans deserve a DVD Crawford set!"
4,Great Film,"I won't repeat the movie's plot here. But there's a scene which fascinates me (great angles and lighting.) When Burt (Cliff Robertson) is crying uncontrollably and has lost contact with reality, Millie (Joan) decides she can't put off calling the psychiatrist recommended to her any longer, Dr. Couzzins. She emerges from the bedroom where we see a black phone in the center of the screen which seems enormous. She gathers her resolve and approaches the phone. The camera then films her from below, with her upper face highlighted. She reaches for the phone--then briefly hesitates and pulls back--but then follows through and calls the psychiatrist, looking around the room as she dials the number, almost as if she is looking for someone who doesn't exist to help her. It's kind of heart-breaking, but a wonderful performance. These are the types of things one picks up on after having seen a film a number of times."
4,Really nice,Really nice replacement for my old sink protector. It wipes down nicely and has stayed in good condition for 2 months.
2,Didn't fit.,Too large for the sink - not tapered to fit the floor of my unit..not explained well in the offering.
4,Laughing at Ourselves,Helen's ability to capture our precious aging moments in humour along with her sensitively delivered and thought-provoking commentaries make her writing very enjoyable to read. She can help us observe our aging from a less cynical perspective and appreciate these moments that pass by us as gifts of which we can be eternally grateful.
2,Caution! Great Song - Just A CD Single!,"You can't fault these four musicians for rushing out and selling a CD as a ""Maurice Gibb Tribute"". However, it is not an album - it is one song at the price of an album. It's a good rendition but only for full Bee Gees fans. It's also an odd choice, given that it is one of the few singles of the Bee Gees that Maurice Gibb did not write. I returned mine and I love the Gibbs."
1,Frank Sinatra-Vol.2 Greatest Hits,"The first volume of the set was great.Volume 2 is another matter.If this was his greatest hits,I wonder were I was when they were being made great.Could have pasted on this one all togather."
3,SHOULD BE CALLED - SINATRA'S EASY LISTENING COLLECTION,"I bought this album for two songs: CYCLES (which was a top 40 single, GOLD album) and LOVE'S BEEN GOOD TO ME (the album it was on hit TOP 40). Besides those two, MY WAY and SEPTEMBER OF MY YEARS the rest is commercial stuff.Buy this CD if it's on sale ..., otherwise don't waste the money."
3,Spotty,"There are many fine Frank tunes on this CD...""Cycles,"" ""My Way,""...but there are also a few glaring pitfalls, the worst of the bunch being his covers of ""Goin' Out of my head"" and ""Something."" Nonetheless, this is still a good collection, and a fine companion album to Greatest hits vol. 1."
3,She knew a lot of people....,"There is a lot of name-dropping here. When I purchased this book, I was looking for a more comprehensive autobiography or memoir. I'm still looking!"
5,An excellent cd from a very talented band,"This album is excellent I like a lot especially twin guitar harmonies My favourite songs are ""Red sharks"",""Painted skies"" and ""Lonely"" but the entire album is worth.I haven't heard their debut album but it should be interesting.I dont find it so progressive as Dream Theater or Fates warning but if you like melodic hard rock with good production and excellent sound dont miss this album.Also you can try this bands (More power/speed metal but equally melodic)Labyrinth,Shadows of steel"
4,Crimson Glory: The Overlooked Rock Band of the 80's,"I received this cd from Columbia House by mistake. I wrote in the wrong code on my ordering form. When this cd arrived at my house about 12 years ago, I thought "" Who the hell is this?"" I decided to listen to them and thought, wow. This cd was great. The music was different than the Heavy Metal bands I listen to like Iron Maiden and Megadeth, but the style completely blew me away. They have very powerful lyrics and strong melodies ranging from very hard rock (Red Sharks) to ballads (Lonely) to the eerie cover song- Trancendance. I still have this in my collection and listen to it every now and then. If you like good hard rock and are willing to try something new, BUY THIS ALBUM!"
5,My all time favorit album,"I'm going to have a very hard time reviewing this album because to me it's beyond words. Every listen (to me) is a spiritual transendence. This album embodies the most moving, powerful spiritual elements of music. By that I mean that every chord gose right through you and stirs your emotions. The singer (Midnight) is in my opinion the greatest singer there ever was. The only track I don't really like is track 2 (steel sharks.) The album peaks at track 7 and 8 (Lonely and Burning Bridges.) I recomend this album to everyone and keep an eye open for Midnight's solo debute coming in Halloween, 2001. Go to ... for more information."
5,Best Hard Rock,"I adored this CD so much that I ordered a backup copy from Europe in case my usable one got scratched. I'm saddened that some of the best bands never made it big like they should have. Get two copies of this CD. Put one in your player, the other in a safe."
5,The Best from the Past,"The movie is old but well thought out & wonderfully portrayed. The DVD retains all the vision & passion, not to mention the struggles & joys of the original film. It is a classic! Such an item deserves a place in ANY ncollection & needs to be watched from time ti time with affection."
1,Poor quality....too bad.,"I love this story but was very disappointed the poor quality of the DVD version. It was transferred directly from a film in poor condition. You can see lint, white spots and lines all through the movie. The scenes are very dark around the edges. Like they say, you get what you pay for. No wonder the price was so cheap. Why don't they stop people from selling such poorly done DVD's on-line? Guess the word just has to get out to watch out for certain companies. Well you are duly warned about this one. I don't know about the out 2 versions on this website, but they were out of stock anyway."
4,Great acting,"I have few oldies, but this caught my attention. It was actually a sweet story. It is only short coming was there was no real punch line, that is, there was a complete plot but no--bang. The movie would not be made today but i imagine in it's day, i was a hit"
4,DVD Quality,This DVD was of excellent quality for a movie produced in 1936. Very enjoyable family movie.
5,An easy-to-miss gem,"May I gently suggest that these other reviewers are missing the point. This delicate David O. Selznick production is brimming with lovely and innocent emotions that are all too out-of-fashion in today's cynical world. Each scene is carefully constructed, with wonderful, warm and kindly touches. Each part is beautifully acted, especially the young Freddie Bartholomew (a few years before another excellent role in Captains Courageous). And the story is one of redemption and good vs. meanness. If you can't handle sweet and sentimental emotions, then maybe this isn't for you--otherwise, these are old-fashioned people to adore!"
2,Little Lord Fauntleroy - 1936,"The 1936 version is NO where near as good as the 1980, remake for TV version, staring Alec Guiness and Ricky Shroeder. We too, have been looking for the 1980 remake, to replace our Beta copy. Until our tape became no longer viewable, and our Beta machine gave out, our family watched the 1980 copy of Little Lord Fauntleroy, every year at Christman. We really miss that tradition and hope which ever studio owns the rights to the movie, will release it for distribution to the public, SOON."
1,not what I ordered,"I ordered this movie for my husband as a stocking stuffer for Christmas. Boy were we surprised when he slipped the disk in and on came ""Mandingo"". What gives? A lack of quality control somewhere, I think. I am returning it ASAP.I have never had a problem before, this is definitely a first."
2,Little Lord Fauntleroy,"This old movie may be about a boy, but it really deals with a mother's emotions regarding giving her son over to live with a crotchety old man (her father-in-law). Yes, the child redeems him and in the end all are living happily ever after. I would not expect a young child of 8 or even 10 to understand the depth of what is going on. They would very likely be quite upset at the thought of being separated from their mom in a similar way."
5,Original story comes alive,"If you want to accurately compare the 1936 movie and the 1980 TV version of Little Lord Fauntleroy, I suggest you first read the story written by Francis Hodgson Burnett. The casting, characterization and dialogue in the 1936 movie is outstanding and is almost an exact visualization of the original story as written by Burnett. The strong point for the 1980 TV version is of course Alec Guiness. Unfortunately in the 1980 version ""Dearest"" is portrayed more or less as a feminist and Schroeder as Fauntleroy is - well too cute. Visual appealing, it is but another example of modern screen writers believing they can write the story better than the original author. If you have to choose, pick the 1936 new DVD version. You will not be disappointed."
1,Don't by the DVD it has important missing scenes,I bought the VHS awhile back and loved it. So when the DVD came out I wanted to get than thinking that it would be a cleaner picture. To my dismay there were some scenes missing. These scenes were important to the character development of Ceddie. I recommend that you wait until they come up with a DVD version that has all of the scenes in it.
5,Both the writing and the subject get more than five stars,"In Fire in My Soul, Dr. Lester accomplishes a rare feat for a biographer. While she avoids the trap of painting too pretty or too perfect a picture of her subject, including a number of descriptions that are less than flattering, she is at the same time able to clearly allow her respect and admiration for this remarkable woman to come through.The effect is that we see a real life heroine, warts and all, and we find her all the more admirable for this.This is an important book, and I look forward to Dr. Lester's next effort."
5,A Must Read During This Time,"A fantastic, inspiring book for these times. Civil Rights history comes alive in the Congresswoman's life story. The writing is diligent and refreshing, illustrating Norton's true integrity and commitment to the core values of the United States Constitution.Lester tells the story in a unique fashion. I couldn't put it down."
1,"Horrible, depressing book","First let me say that I have read several of Gregory's books and I have enjoyed them all immensely. This book is a HUGE exception! Fallen Skies is a horribly depressing book. Granted, any book depicting the trauma experienced by war veterans can have a tendency to be depressing but every aspect of this book was depressing. The story is incredibly slow and tedious and the characters are not likeable at all. Each new chapter contained more death, rape, kidnapping, murder and general unhappiness than the last. If you enjoy stories about husbands who rape their wives, try to murder their own children, stab babies to death and make everyone miserable, then this is the book for you. Otherwise, don't waste your time or money."
5,Heart Pounding Ending,"I think I have read all of Philippa Gregory's work. Fallen Skies was unique in the structure of the last few chapters in the book. The level of suspense and the finely crafted web of facts and characters all come together for the best who-done-it ending I have ever read. The book would not be characterized by most as a mystery but I couldn't help but marvel at Gregory's expertise and compare her to the best of mystery writers. The historical and social aspects of the story are as good as any she has written, but again, the suspense at the end is brilliant."
2,"Weak beginning, strong ending","I've read 10+ of Philippa Gregory's historical novels, and enjoyed them all. However, when I was first reading it, I didn't much care about either of the two main characters or what happened to them. They both had plenty of flaws. Just when I would begin to sympathize with one of them, they make another bad decision.I'm updating now since I finished the book yesterday. Once I decided which characters I wanted to root for, I became more engaged in the story.The author crafts several intriguing plot twists, and more than one dark secret is revealed by the end. She kept me riveted for the last few chapters - I literally could not put it down!My overall opinion is that this a very powerful anti-war novel, and provides the reader with a lot of ideas to ponder."
3,Decently written; abruptly ended...,"Before writing my own, I was reading the other readers' reviews and I tend to agree with them overall: it's a good story, plenty of suspense building, and yes, the last few chapters DID keep me rapidly turning pages.But when I got to the last page, I turned it for more... and there WERE no more. That's it?! Rather than ""ending,"" it just seemed to stop.Just felt unfinished to me.That's what kept me from giving this book more stars."
3,Fallen Skies - a novel not up to my usual expectations from this writer,"I am admitted devotee of Phillipa Gregory, having purchaed five of her novels recently from Amazon. ""Fallen Skies"" however, set in post World War I England would have appealed to me more were it not dragged out in too much of the same repetitive writing throughout, and an ending that was a foregone conclusion, but like the rest of the book was drawn out unnecessarily."
2,Boooor...ooooo...ing...And that's the good part!,"I adore Philippa Gregory's novels and was thrilled to discover one I hadn't read yet when I received my Kindle for Christmas. It was the first thing I ordered! However, it proved to be a huge disappointment: totally lacking in the character development and sense of era recreation that I feel most of us look forward to in her work. Her characters are flat and very one-dimensional and therefore difficult to become involved with or care about. It's as though the author is reporting in print what is being seen through a video recorder set above her characters rather than taking the reader into the action. Dialogue is stilted. And WHAT is going on with that final plot twist that ends the novel? It was almost like the classic ending from the ""Michael O'Donahue's (SNL Writer) School of How to Write Good"" satire..""Suddenly, everyone is run over by a truck."" I was very unhappy I wasted my money."
1,Couldn't finish it,"I agree with the other reviewers who gave this book a poor rating. I quit reading it only 1/3 of the way through, because it was going downhill so fast. The lead female character was shallow and weak while the lead male character was manipulative, cruel, and emotionally disturbed. I prefer to read stories with *some* redeeming qualities, and this one failed that litmus test entirely."
2,"Lots of info, not well written.","Abzug does a good job in compiling lots of information portraying an interesting view on religious reform in the antebellum period. However this book is typical of many in the same category: Abzug is a great historian, but not a very good writer. When reading this book it seems that one must translate every sentence into ""regular"" English. Abzug is simply hard to understand. However, it would be suspected that anyone who reads this book has some background in the field of antebellum time period and especially reform in New England in the early-to-mid-19th century.Cosmos Crumbling provides some interesting perspectives, but it's a hard read, and when finished you'll probably still be left wondering what Abzug is trying to say. I read the book twice before I had an idea what his main points were."
2,Clearly Biased Review,"After twenty-five years, Simon re-emerges with a new work on the Necronomicon.The first section deals with the supposed history behind the Simon Necronomicon's appearance. Is it true? Perhaps, though I doubt Simon was really the model for Corso in THE NINTH GATE. Is it entertaining? Definitely.The second is an argument in favor of the Necronomicon's existence, which critiques its critics, including our book, THE NECRONOMICON FILES. I'd recommend that readers double-check what Simon says against other sources as much as possible. I've already found one talking point that originates in a roleplaying game, and another where the source Simon cites contradicts what he wrote. Even by occult trade paperback standards, the factual content is unimpressive.On a personal note, we are disappointed in Simon's showing, and are seriously considering whether he'll remain our literary arch-nemesis. It's like he just doesn't care."
2,Simon's pension is a little sparse so he wrote this book,"Why did Simon, after so many years, decide to supplement his earlier works? He's about 58 and I think he needs the money.The first half of this uninspiring tripe is ""the story behind"" the ""Necronomicon."" There's a lot about small, dicey Eastern Orthodox churches which seem to have some very slight connection to the book--I keep forgetting how.The second half is a defense of the authenticity of the work.I'd rather have seen a compact, on-point back story and then a documentary about how people have been using the ""Necronomicon"" over the past quarter-century. Rather than sling words with his critics, he might better have proven ""it works."""
5,Simon SPEAKS !!!,"Hahahaha! sorry, the last reviewer's ridiculous evaluation makes it hard for me to type this out...this must be the year of the Necronomicon, cause Donald Tyson has a new book on Alhazred! Dead Names is a great book; invaluable to those who want to know about the more eldritch side of occultism.if the idea of the Necronomicon has been 'used' by Simon for personal gain, then it's clear that others, such as the reviewer below, have also used the Necronomicon for their own misguided benefit.all i have left to say is that the living and real life Cult of Cthulhu will be studying The Dark History of the Necronomicon!Venger SatanisCult of Cthulhu High Priest"
1,He'll pay the price later ...,"Most of what's written here is plain fetid garbage. The text is weak, rife with error and reeks of pure sensationalist detritus for the sake of profit and profit alone. This should be avoided at all costs. Hopefully the money gained by this endeavor was spent well."
1,Not worth the money!,"I just read this book out of curiosity. I had hoped to learn about the necronomicon. All ""Simon"" talks about is his own life, or should I say fantasy life. He ends up sounding like an angry child with an ""I'll show THEM"" attitude. And there really isn't much history to it. He borrows a lot from books by Robert Anton Wilson and others, calling it his owns life. Very sad. But I'm sure he has already made a pretty penny just based on the shock value of the title. I advise you to save your money for something valid."
5,Such delicious fun.,"Max Payne is one of those rare games that does everything right. Great plot, amazingly fun, and it doesn't take itself seriously at all. You are Max Payne -- an ex-cop whose family was killed by junkies. As the game's plot unfolds, you are sucked into a conspiracy that takes you from exacting your revenge on petty mob bosses all the way up to those responsible for ruining you. The game's Bullet Time system gives you the edge you need to defeat the hordes of mobsters, mercenaries, and more sent to stop you from discovering the truth about your past. I also highly recommend downloading the Kung Fu mod, which essentially turns Max into Neo. This game is worth every cent."
3,Faulty workmanship and materials,"Upon receiving this Doc Ock action figure, it didn't take long to realize I had gotten a lemon. The attack action lever didn't go down, therefore no attack action. Immediately following this frustration, his left arm fell out of the socket. Not to mention the tentacle claw that broke when examined. These didn't happen with my son at the reigns, they occured all in my usual inspection of any action figure I purchase for him. Needless to say, I'm very disappointed. For that matter, I'm mad!"
4,"She&#65533;s been damned, but it&#65533;s still a damn fine book","Turns out much of what Lillian Hellman wrote in Pentimento was stolen from another person's life, but still, An Unfinished Woman, for which she won the National Book Award in 1969 (for autobiography) is quite a coup. Political activist, critic, and playwrite, Hellman cut a wide swath thru literary circles during her heyday in the 40s, 50s and 60s. This introspective collection of her journal entries and memories shines with her acerbic brilliance. Her circle of `friends' included just about all the famous people of her era: Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Dorothy Parker, Faulkner, and of course Dashiell Hammett, her lover, friend, and confidant. This is a personal account of a life lived as if there were no tomorrow, a nearly romantic rendering of the flavor of a special era in this country, and the documentation of feminine empowerment before the word had even been invented."
3,"Side pockets for water bottle, anyone?",I got this bag for my son because his back pack zipper was broken on the 2nd day of middle school. I grabbed this one because of the sale price. But I didn't realize it has no side pockets for his water bottle. I checked this review before I bought it. To my surprise no one mentioned about this. Does everyone else has alternative solution?
5,Holds quite alot for a small backpack,I really like the blue color of the blue/gray back pack. I like that there are a lot of compartments and being able to put a variety of things in the pack. The straps are very comfortable and easy to adjust. I feel the pack is a great quality product and the price is more than fair.
3,Not big at all,I was looking for a large backpack for my middle school son and the description on this said it was very large. It is NOT large at all. He could not fit his 4 binders and 4 textbooks in this.
2,backpack,"bag was durable and expedited refund. However,the measurements of this backpack were not what was stated. So i ended up spending $13 on shipping of an item i could not use."
2,Doesn't Stay Zipped,"The book bag is nice to look at but horrible to use!!!!! The zippers on the big parts do not stay zipped and the straps that draw the book bag together do not stay closed. I almost lost my Macbook out of it in the airport because the bag wouldn't stay shut. I'm only using this bag until my new book bag arrives from LLBean....I have to wear it on my stomach instead of my back though, so I can keep zipping it back up and making sure my stuff doesn't fall out...."
2,Disapointing,This product looks bigger in the picture than it really is. The padding is inadequate and there are a lot of unnecessary straps. The only up side is...it's cheap.
1,Too small,Bag was too small and arrived wet due to heavy rain. (However the Bag was sealed in plastic so nothing happened to it.I would just say that this bag is way TOO SMALL for High school students. You would be better off with a JanSport bag from a local store...
1,Zipper Broke,"The zipper broke on this within two weeks of use. I was looking for a large backpack for my high schooler, and this is large. It does hold the books. But without a zipper, ..... I need a new backpack!"
3,A decent backpack,"This backpack has its share of annoyances, but it's pretty sturdy.On the plus side:- It's durable. It never frayed after bringing it back and forth on the subway to work every day, and now my son uses it for school.- It holds a lot. It has four pockets and you can really stuff a lot into each one.On the minus side:- The side strap blocks the zipper. This sounds minor, but when you're opening it a lot, it's annoying. The side strap gets in your way and you have to maneuver around it every time you open the thing.- The straps don't quite adjust right. I could never get it to the point where the thing felt fully comfortable on my back. It would rest against my lower back too much. I finally just adjusted the straps to be very tight, which made it a pain to take off and put on."
3,perfect size and perfect color,I really love this backpack! It is just the perfect size and perfect color! This is my first year in high school and it fits all of my books really well! I would defiantly recommend it!
1,Not Happy... They make it difrficult to return an item.,"I ordered a backpack for Christmas that my daughter has been wanting for a long time, blue and black plaid Fatboy. They sent the wrong color. The one they sent is a puke green. I immediately contacted ""seller"" through Amazon. I couldn't just simply return the item since there was no return address on the invoice in the box. After contacting ""seller"" through Amazon, I did receive and email from OnlineSports saying they apologize and that they would be sending me return labels so I could send back the wrong item. So far... No return labels have been sent. I tried looking up ""OnlineSports"" ...""online"" but it seems they don't exist. This is very frustrating. I sent another email through Amazon to ""contact seller"" and received a reply that was just a copy of the previous email. Someone at Amazon or OnlineSports needs to give me an address I can send this item back to AND ...REFUND my money."
2,"Great size, but zipper is already gone","I got this backpack in September for my 4th grade daughter. Great size. She could but all her books (one heavy textbook and some notebooks), snack, light coat, and all the notes she writes with her friends. Loved it, until the zipper broke. For a month now I've been realigning the teeth to get it to close. Didn't even last five months. She loves the High Sierra designs, but I'm afraid to waste my money only to have another zipper break."
4,High Sierra Fat Boy,"Have had this pack for 3 years. Used to use it to carry to work during 12 hour shifts, now I use it for school. Great pack and it lasts"
4,Great for school,"I purchased this for my collage books and binders, there are nine of them in total, and they all fit into the ""fat boy"" with space left over! It is also very accessible for laptops and notebooks; I personally use my laptop on a day to day basis,wich is also something that I have found to be difficult to do with other backpacks."
5,Great Backpack. Good price,Bought this to replace my 8 year old son's cheap-o Walmart backpack. It is very spacious and I don't think he knows of all the pockets. He's used it for months now so it's durable.
5,Great Item,Great service and shipping... My son loved it. Great size for him and all his junk for high school. I paid $60 for his first bag this year and it broke 2 months in. This was $20- so we'll see how long this one holds up. Let u know.
4,"Good, not Great","Everything was great, but the bag is not as big as I would have liked it to be. Oh well, that's what I get for buying a backpack online. Even though, I still like it."
5,Great backpack!,I purchased this backpack for my son who is in fifth grade. It is very sturdy and roomy. It has taken a lot of abuse so far and still looks like brand new. I have a feeling we'll have this backpack for a few years.
4,Very cute,Bought this for my boyfriends little sister. it's so cute its a little bit smaller than anticpated but its perfect for a 12 year old :]
4,School Backpack,The backpack looks great and is good quality! I hope our son can make this one last!! Thanks a lot!
4,Great Considering the Price,"For the price, this bag is great. It's not your latest hot backpack with ultralight, use forever, space age materials, but its a great extra bag to have around."
1,Tad to non-original....,"You would think with three different authors that the book might have a chance of developing a good plot centering around these three women. Though after the first couple of chapters I found myself liking the bad guys a whole lot more than the whiney or ""I'll protect you all"" or ""I'm a wuss"" princesses. Sure as the story moved on they got a bit better but still they were very chiche as was the evil omnipotent bad guy who ""advises"" the deluded king. Oh well, you can't always win."
5,Incredible,"I bought this book by chance at a village fete, and it turned out to be the best book I have ever read. From the opening description of the politics of the Peninsula to the final confrontation, Black Trillium is pure class. Haramis, Kadiya and Anigel are vivid, lifelike characters with whom the reader can readily sympathise. I find myself sympathising especially with Haramis, who reminds me of myself, and I see elements of Kadiya and Anigel in my two sisters. It is a shame that so few people have heard of this series, I have also read Blood Trillium and am eagerly searching for the others!"
3,Disappointing!,"I must admit I was disappointed by this book. It sounded great, and there were many interesting concepts throughout the story, but I found the plot and (especially) the characters just didn't work. The three authors are all wonderful individually, but didn't seem to write well together in this book. A great pity!"
3,"Good ideas, bad characters","I have read other books by Bradely and Norton, and this one was a let-down. Although the ideas about the Oddlings was interesting, I could not find myself identifing with any of the characters. They were far too shallow. Although the plot was very complicated (I like complicated), it seemed to just fester toward the end. It was a disapointment, but I suppose that if you like to gather ideas, then it was worth it."
5,my favorite book,"i love this book so much, it is my favorite book. it's about these three sisters who are given a quest for three magical talismans they find them and banish they evil orogatus from the land to the baren ice.it is better when you read every book in the saga."
3,Not the greatest book,"I thought Black Trillium would be a great book because of the three women authoring it, but I found it to be rather shallow. The plot was okay, but the characters didn't have any depth to them. I found myself begging for a conclusion to a boring story. While it's slightly interesting, Black Trillium is a disappointing novel."
2,Why does the review not mention the author's strong religious background?,"I am returning this book after opening it up and reading more about the author. This book has a lot of 5 star reviews, and I feel that the description of the book should be more clear that it is from an author whose ""articles have appeared in more than 50 Christian and general market publications."" Oh and that he was the acquisitions editor for a ministry."
1,Pedantice and Useless,"A ""Big Secret"" is not to just your spell checker? Come on, now. We want meat. This book is a pitch for other products. It is an embarrassingly blatant attempt to exploit fears of writers."
5,Learn from an expert,"In Book Proposals That Sell Terry Whalin shares 21 secrets he has learned as both a writer and editor. Like any business there are rules to follow and Whalin does an excellent job of breaking down those rules in such a way that anyone from novice to professional can learn something new. He shares what he has learned from his time on both sides of the publishing desk in an easy-to-read, and, more importantly, easy-to-understand book. What I most appreciate about this book is an understanding of the decision making process that goes on behind closed doors. Writers still have to have great ideas with a clearly defined market, but Book Proposals That Sell will help move a proposal from the no pile to the let's take a closer look pile and, hopefully, to the yes pile."
5,An Invaluable Read,"Whalin writes from having been on both sides of the book publishing desk: acquisitions editor, literary agent and writer. When marketing nonfiction or fiction with a book proposal, this book will be invaluable to your efforts. Whalin tells you what the editor and agent look for in a book proposal they can accept. The book presents a comprehensive guide to writing nonfiction book proposals. If you've completed a novel you want to market, you will also need to write a book proposal; many parts of this book will apply to the fiction writer's book proposal. Whalin references authentic resources that give a roadmap to completing a fiction book proposal. On page 102 Whalin writes, ""The proposals that sell, however, are the ones in which the author thoroughly presents the concept and includes all of the necessary information."" Then in an appendix he includes a checklist to use when preparing nonfiction book proposals. I recommend the book."
5,Book Proposals Made Easy!,I used this guide to prepare my first book proposal. Eight months later I had an agent and a publisher and I just published my first book - thank you!Taking Charge of Your Own Health: Navigating Your Way Through *Diagnosis *Treatment *Insurance *And More
5,This is a very helpful book,"You can have a really great book, but the editor will never know it unless you have a proposal that clearly describes it. And sells it! Terry has written proposals for numerous books that he's sold to numerous publishers. He's also been an editor who's read numerous proposals, both good and bad. He knows what a good proposal looks like. I've written book proposals, but I needed something that would make them really come alive. This book is making a real difference.Cherry Pedrick"
5,Blessing from Cover to Cover,Absolutely one of the hardest things I've done this year in relationship to my writing. It provided so much more than I counted on and gave me the ability to narrow in on where I was going with my book idea.so much for so little...small price and a great resource!One of the best outlines I've used...and I read it 4 times...to get the most from each chapter.
5,EXCELLENT!!!!!,"I read this book prior to writing my book proposal. It was an easy-to-read book which I completed reading in a day. The ""21 Secrets to Speed Your Success"" were excellent. I utilized this book to write my book proposal which landed me a publishing contract. Thank you Terry Whalin for your insider secrets and this awesome book!!"
5,Keri,"This book was eye opening. Terry Whalin uses his 20 plus years in the publishing industry to help authors understand exactly what sells and what doesn't. As a beginner, I was looking for a really good book that would tell me exactly what a book proposal needed to have and in addition some tips that would put me ahead of the game. This book did just that! Some of the steps may seem like common sense (I read one of the lower reviews) however, Mr. Whalin would not include it in the book if he didn't see authors continue to make these mistakes over and over as an acquisitions editor. It is great to know that the tips are coming from a trusted source and a person who truly wants other authors to succeed. I recommend this book to anyone whether you are a beginner or expert!"
4,"A solid, raw variety of Young, non-radio, classics","What ""Tonight's the Night"" lacks in momentum, it gains in variety. This CD doesn't flow like his previous efforts, much less future recordings, but none of his other CDs takes you on an emotional roller coaster like this one. It's sort of the ""Disintegration (by The Cure)"" of its time, recorded during a dark period of Young's life where the music and lyrics just came out naturally. An effective maniupulater of moods, ""Tonight's the Night"" is pleasing to the senses - pleading, lazily swanky, and resolved. ""Albaqurque, Roll Another Number, and Let's Go Downtown"" are great tunes, as is the title song. The mood of this CD was a perfect fit for the mid 70s, and at a time when grunge is well entrenched in the minds of many modern rock artists - if not explicitly displayed - this CD is a great listen. Solid from beginning to end, it's a must add to any size Neil Young collection."
5,A desert island disc,"This album did not, as John Gilman erroneously states, come hot on the heels of Harvest. In between the two came two of NYs great three recordings (this being his third), Time Fades Away, and the extraordinary On The Beach; neither of which have ever been released on cd. It is a shame that those of the listening public who are without a turntable and a good 2nd hand lp source are unable to appreciate the full triumvirate. This is a great record with some very stark singing and emotional playing. In turns it is mournful, rocking, elegaic, and brooding. A desert island disc."
4,depressing brilliance,"Depressing brilliance. Nothing else to add. Give this a listen without possible overdoses nearby. This record does not make you happy, but it makes you respect Young's honesty."
2,too old,"didn't realize so much of his early stuff was devoted to talking about, celebrating, using illegal drugs. Some of the music i like, but not most of the lyrics."
4,Tonight's the Night - Neil Young,Great album by Neil Young. What else would you expect from Neil Young? Great selection of songs and the sound is excellent as well. I will be searching for more albums by Neil Young.
1,Too stoned to sing or play even fairly well,"He really captured the abysmal feelings of bereavement that caused him and the band to remain so drunk, so drugged that they couldn't play in time, or sing on pitch or give any evidence that they cared. Fine for them; work it out however you have to. But why a listener should have to pay for such indulgence is beyond me. Young is not afraid to record mistakes nor to release them. But music fans shouldn't have to pay for them unless they are the most ardent collectors or Young fans."
5,The Other Great Album by Neil Y.,"I have yet to listen to this album But i know this will be a 5 star stuff.Oh by the new, La Noise the new album is brilliant too. Love it. Never get enough of Neil Young. Listen to his voice is just worth every money."
3,Not worthy of essential rating,"I have all of Neil Young's records on vinyl up to Live Rust, so my review is limited to this time frame. Given this qualification, I do not see how Tonight's the Night could be a Neil Young Essential ahead of Everybody Know's This Is Nowhere. Out of all these records, Tonight is the one I listen to the least. Don't get me wrong, it is still Neil Young and good music, but it's really only of interest as a snapshot of him and his band in a particular time period, the mid 70s, which they are barely crawling out of. However, Neil and his band seem to realize the narrow breadth of their escape from this destructive era. Tonight should be replaced as an Essential by Decade, and Decade should be replaced as a Best of the Rest by Everybody Knows this is Nowhere, a very underrated album with longlasting influences. This album is where Pearl Jam has been coming from in the last few years (with NY on Mirrorball,etc..). Not that this is necessarily a good thing."
5,The absolute best Neil Young album,"Look no farther, this is as good as it gets in the great long career of Neil Young. The deaths of guitarist Danny Whitten and roadie Bruce Barry moved Young to write the single greastest statement against drug use you'll ever hear. I say this because the record is musically as powerful as anything he's done and it is never, ever preachy. Young and Crazy Horse sound burned out, but that only adds to the raw authenticity. If you only own one Young CD, this should be the one."
5,Quintessential Young,"Although HARVEST and AFTER THE GOLD RUSH are commonly mentioned when the question of Young's best work comes up, TONIGHT'S THE NIGHT is necessary Young listening. Sloppy and off key at times, this is Young in top basement form--if you like him, or if you hate him--this album is why."
5,"Farewell Top 40 Radio, Hello Genius","Anyone who follows up a No.1 album of country rock with a drunken rock tribute (concept) to the 2 recent deaths of Danny Whitten and Bill Berry victim to drugs is a genius. Neil does the unexpected and he is a true artist and the stellar opposite of the ""Top 40 Formula/American Idol"" music business. Way to go Neil."
5,my favorite neil young.,"this is not going to be for everybody, & that's quite a shame: because this IS neil young's best record. at times sounding slightly drunk, sloppy, shaggy and beautiful, this record is a feast for the soul. I'm not saying you're a bad person if you don't like it, I'm just saying take a look in the mirror & ask yourself if you want to be the kind of person who goes through life out of touch with greatness?"
1,Worst Sounding Album Ever!,"I understand that many people like this album for the lyrics describing Neil Young's feelings after two of his band members overdosed. But people need to understand he was drunk, sounded drunk, he vocals are not like in ""Harvest"", the music is not melodic at all. Only fanatic Neil Young fans would like this record."
1,Don't believe everything the critics tell you,"Not NY's best and except for a few tunes easily the weakest of the trilogy of pain albums. Knowing he can do a lot better makes this a must pass for me. Cool cover photo though. The irony is NY's worst is still better than anything Johnny Rotten ever did.Now let's see ""Time Fades Away"" on CD."
3,does not compute,"This is a spotty collection. The premise -- a world without computers -- is certainly interesting. The antho, sadly, did not live up to its potential.Some of the stories are excellent, thought-provoking, and moving: Alex Irvine's ""Reformation,"" Del Stone Jr.'s ""I Feed the Machine,"" and John Meaney's ""The Swastika Bomb."" A few were truly dreadful -- loosely related at best and/or more style than substance -- including a couple I couln't even make it through. Most were solid, but still dissapointing, on topic, but not credible as to how or why computers weren't in this world. One, John Grant's ""No Solace for the Soul in Digitopia,"" was simply porn with (at its end) a veneer of alternate-universe's clothing.The closest thing to a common thread was biotech of one sort or another replacing some functions of silicon computing, and the inherent differences of the two computing approaches. When done well (about half the time), that made for something to think about."
3,Very Uneven Anthology,"The premise of this anthology is ""What would a world without the internet be like?"" Some are quite entertaining and inventive and others (notably David Brin and John Grant) are just boring. The majority are just readable and not really worth the time to discuss.The Novella by John Meaney is the most complete but that may be because it's the only long story in the book and the length helps alot. Some of the writers seem to think that an abrupt ending (like a song that just stops) is how best to end a short story. IMHO it's not. A couple of the stories are just convoluted musings and go nowhere fast.All in all Harlan Ellison has nothing to fear.Zeb Kantrowitz"
3,It is good but should cost less,"The day I bought this figure I realized nearly nothing worked. The Doc Ock tentacles are durable but it is impossible to get them to stay in the subway piece they're supposed to stay in but they are fairly useful if you pick Spiderman up with them. Though if you attempt this make sures you put the claws of the tentacles under his arms or it won't work. The only major upside is that the spiderman figure is super durable...oh and by the way, the spin and kick action does not work right. For one thing his kick cannot move an ant if you tried and you can never seem to aim right. Fun but try not to lose your mind trying to get it to work."
1,I Hate This Book,"Achebe was correct when he described this book as a sick book. It is. Just disgusting and trying to hard to be sophisticated, ie, ""European"". The description by Achebe that Armah's book reminds him of the Jean Paul Sartre novel where two characters sit around looking bored in a cafe in Paris and then in a burst of nihilistic energy decide to stab themselves to make some obscure point to each other. He's on the money. Unfortunately Armah came on the scene when publishing in Africa was not more discriminating."
3,"Good idea, not what I thought it would be",The principal of a towel warmer is great..a toasty towel waiting for you when you step out of the shower. Unfortunately this really is only for assistance in drying the towel after you are finished. It does a fine job of that but it's not hot enough to really get the towel warm otherwise.
1,Disappointed,"Purchasing this item on Amazon proved to be a disappointment to me. I had copied the book title, author, & publisher from an original book owned by a family member. Then when I ordered the book I checked the date to be sure I was ordering an original. Everything seemed to be correct, but when the book arrived it was a reprint, not an original. No where in the book info on Amazon was there a mention that I was ordering a reprint. VERY DISAPPOINTED!!I now realize there is no way to verify the actual book being ordered. I would not use this method of purchase again."
5,Be prepared for a shock,"War is inevitable so a family and friend move into a fallout shelter for the duration. Due to some quirk they come out in another time after the war has finished off civilization, as we knew it. Now prepare for a different civilization.This book is a classic example of Late Heinlein works as opposed to his early works i.e. ""Past Through Tomorrow Future History Stories."" However as in any discipline the early product is usually more structured and well inside the curve of accepted norms. You can only carry that so far. Then any artist that is to stand out must experiment and take chances beyond the norm. That is what made ""Stranger in a Strange Land"" (be sure to read the full length version) so great. What do you do after that? Die? No you ether stagnate or further define your point. I can not tell you which this book does. However it is definitely worth reading.Farmer in the Sky by Robert A Heinlein"
2,Not Heinlein's best,"Submitted for your approval... one Hugh Farnham, the slightly henpecked patriarch of a typical ""Father Knows Best"" 1950's family. He is a man ridiculed by his loved ones for building a basement bomb shelter and endlessly scanning newscasts for any signs of Commie aggression. But when the Reds drop the big one right in Uncle Sam's backyard, Hugh and his clan, his house boy and daughter's friend Barbara, gets more than some radioactive fallout. They are transported into a future dimension where the Africans rule and all others are slaves.Flat pros, one-dimensional characters and stiff dialogue keeps this flight of fantasy earthbound. Some might be shocked by its treatment of sexuality in a post apocalyptic world, others by its depiction of racial stereotyping."
3,Eh... OK,"Reading this book I'd equate to playing tennis on a cold, windy, Saturday afternoon: Yeah, it's fun... but you'd probably rather be doing something else, like reading any other Heinlein that isn't so damn dumb. This book is entertaining, yeah... but then again, so is watching the Brady Bunch. But thoughtful? Original? Insightful? No! If you read to be entertained, then you won't be dissapointed. If you read to be challenged, to think deeper about how the underlying theme applies to YOU (i.e.Lucifers Hammer)... then no, you'll come away feeling same as I."
3,Good Heinlein book!,"A good book about a post-apocalyptic future written by a great. The society the Farnham's encounter after a nuclear war is disturbing to say the least. The heros are not always heroic and the ending is somewhat dry. I guess what I mean by Hugh not being that heroic is that he is a cut-and-dry realist. He does what's necessary and will cut loose a family member if the situation requires. It's a ""top of the food chain"" type world and Hugh is gonna survive. Good for the average reader. Of course, a must for Heinlein fans.JK"
1,Slow and Boring,"For me, one star is generous. I finished the book so I could make sure that it didn't get better. The characters are shallow and have no depth. I enjoy a good apocalyptic novel, but this doesn't come close to any I've read. The Postman, No Blade of Grass, Alas Babylon, Lucifer's Hammer are all vastly superior.This book had potential with the nuclear bomb transporting the characters to a different time, but didn't follow up on it. Too many bridge references, and I enjoy playing bridge.Not worth your time."
4,Where is the Sequel!!!,I found myself interested in the actual storyline after the characters were returned in time.
1,The worst of Heinlein's works,"I had already read almost every book Heinlein wrote before I got to this one and did not think I would ever find a book of his that I would hate, but this is it. I gave it a 2 for what I thought of as an inspired plot, but pan the rest due to really, really, really poorly conceived characters."
2,Disappointing,"I love Heinlein's early stuff. His later stuff is often preachy with the pacing of molasses in a New England winter. And then there is this.It's the pacing of the early work, with the preaching like quality of the later, and characters I find it hard to believe Heinlein created.None of the characters are really all that believable. They are flat and inconsistant in their behavior. Even the Ayn Rand-esque main protagonist seems poorly thought out and tiresome.The story has many interesting points, and some of the future society ideas are very well done. But the plot that they backdrop is far less interesting. I often wondered where events were coming from. And the ending seemed self-indulgent and disappointing.I love a great deal of RAH's work, but this isn't one of them."
3,Not his best,"This and Glory Road were the last two Heinlein novels I really liked. Afterwards Heinlein changed his style and many would agree not for the better. One problem with this book is that it does not flow as well as his earlier works partly because Heinlein takes up too many pages with thinly disguised preaching about society and how it should be run. Bear in mind that Heinlein was essentially of the Campbell school of thought about science fiction: take an idea and derive its logical conclusions and consequences and present them in story form. But no matter how one tries, when the subject is about economics, society, and people rather than about physics, chemistry, and engineering, personal opinion and bias is bound to creep in. The bias in this book shows very clearly that Heinlein, although progressive in some areas of thought, was definitely a prisoner of his time in others."
1,The ultimate best use of this book is to level furniture,"What a great writer and what an awful book. It defies belief that this book was ever reprinted let alone let into the light of print when first printed. The author's obvious hangups are witlessly displayed for all you would be shrinks to have a field day (picnic and lunch included).If that table in the corner needs a book under one leg to make it level, THIS IS THE PERFECT BOOK FOR THE JOB"
1,A very good book not to read,"Heinlein wrote some significant books, but tends to preach. Everything worth saying Heinlein said in his early work, concluding with ""Stranger in a Strange Land"". His early work is interesting and sometimes charming (cf ""The Star Beast""). Heinlein is one of the greats of Sci Fi, but would have been more so if he had not written anything after ""Stranger"". His later work is not worth reading and this goes in particular for FF. Hope it stays out of print."
5,Great Boot!!!,"I love these boots. They are stylish, true to size and just all around show-stoppers! Buy them and you won't be disappointed."
2,Terribly Uncomfortable,"These boots are HOT! The look is great but they hurt my arch after only 15 minutes of wearing. Not just a little pain, but so much so, I have to take them off immediately. I gave the boots 2 stars because they look so great but If rating on comfort, the rating would be negative stars. I've only worn them twice because of this. I've had a couple of friends try them on and they can't wear them either."
1,A Branding Abomination,"Narnia without CS Lewis? A Narnain story without the complex themes Lewis wove in the Chronicles. Rubbish!One reviewer wrote this:""I suppose that what would bother Lewis (and what should bother us) is not that the book isn't ""Christian,"" but that it isn't any good. It's flat, predictable, and utterly undistinguished. It is hard to imagine that a story this lifeless would have been published had there been no Narnia hook.""Let this be the last attempt to exploit the Lewis legacy."
1,A Giant Surprise is A Giant Rip-off,"Nothing Narnia here, nothing C.S. Lewis here, nothing worth buying here.Beware the onslaught of Narnia ""branding"". C.S. Lewis would be appalled at this trite, giggly desecration."
3,A Little disappointed,I bought this book in the hopes that it was as well written as the author's other book The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe. I was disappointed in it as were my grandchildren.
2,"Narnian Glurge, nothing more","I, too, have to agree with the consensus that the book is nothing special, and only receives attention because it cashes in on the Narnia franchise at a time when Narnia is coming once again to the public's attention. At best, it's cute and the illustrations are pretty. At worst, the story is rather silly and nothing special.My children are young -- ages 2, 4 and 6 -- and they're big on hearing the stories they love read to them over and over again. They've heard this book once, and have never given it a second glance since."
3,watch out/compatibility,Needs other system components to work. Not a good phone to purchase as a non technical customer. I think the phone itself is very good.
3,"decent introduction, bad production","I bought this album because I liked the few Orange Juice tracks I'd heard at the time and didn't want to pay the import prices for ""You Can't Hide Your Love Forever"". Anyone buying this for OJ material will be disappointed - the focus is mainly on Collins' solo material, and the versions of OJ tracks on this disc don't sound nearly as crisp, bright and energetic as they do on YCHYLF."
5,A virtual unknown in the United States,"This is a great album. Dj Valium was the first project of Suprime Music and started 1999. The team behind this Acts is the same as with Groove Coverage and Baracuda, Axel Konrad and Ole Wierk. When the 2nd single ""Go right for..."" was released the team got a new member: Tanja Korb a.k.a. ""Tat"" who's is the singer and head of the act.Dj Volume was formerly known as Dj Valium until Roche manufacturer of diazepam disagreeded with the trademark and they had to change their name.I think the best songs on the album are Let's All Chant, Doin' It Again, and Go Right For. The only unfortunate thing about this album is that Amazon is selling it as an import at $46.98 (as of August 30, 2009). This is way over priced for the United States market."
2,Novice cooks should be wary of aluminum,"This beautiful blue roaster is only oven safe to 350 degrees.Since ovens vary and forgetful cooks cannot guarantee the oven temperature, this is a poor choice for REAL roasting!"
1,My iPod would not connect to my Sony laptop,"Sure is a space saver when traveling, but my iPod (2nd gen, firewire only) would not connect to my VGN-S260 laptop with this cable. Simply not recognized by iTunes or iPod Updater 2005-03-23. Wasted a lot of time trying to troubleshoot.Later I tried a regular (non-retractable) cable, and my iPod was recognized fine.Maybe I got a flaky unit or maybe it's a general quality problem with this Iogear product."
1,Horrible,"I bought this cable to use with a 120GB external hard drive, when I hooked it up my computer wouldn't recognize the drive. I called Iogear tech support, and they said the cable won't work with large hard drives. It would have been nice to know this before I bought it. This is very deceptive advertising, it doesn't say anything about external hard drive size. Right on the back of the package it says ""Great for use with external hard drives."" Sure it is. All tech support could say was there is nothing they can do about it. No help whatsoever."
5,A great piece of music,"This music is some of the best I have heard in quite a while. Sure the movie may have flopped, but I still liked it, primarily on the strength of the music Zimmer created for it. Just look at what Zimmer did for Gladiator (a great movie on its own, but Best Picture material with Zimmer's score).Busted's theme can be hard to understand for those not used to their brand of British singing and I can see why it might take a few close listenings to be able to fully understand them, but it's fun to listen to nonetheless.This is simply music at its finest: light, hyponotic, and intriguing."
2,Molehill,"This was Mountain MkII - the original quartet had split in 1972, then Leslie West and Felix Pappalardi re-formed with a new drummer and second guitarist for one passable if uninspired studio album (""Avalanche"" in 1974) and this concert souvenir. And that's putting it politely; both West and Pappalardi seem to be phoning it in, and drummer Schwartzberg - aside from being no Corky Laing (one of the most underrated hard rock drummers of the early 1970s) - is more sledgehammer than rhythm expander. The original double album included a two-sides-long version of ""Nantucket Sleighride"" that seemed an exercise in lost self-indulgence upon original release, and it still sounds that way. If you're a longtime Mountain fan, you've heard way better from them. This album is thoroughly unworthy of them even today."
2,Not A Great Performance,"As a long-time fan of Mountain, I found this set to be far less than satisfactory. Leslie West and Felix Pappalardi are here, but Corky Laing and Steve Knight are absent, replaced by Bob Mann and Alan Schwartzberg, neither of whom plays well. Mann's guitar/keyboard work is surpassed in its awfulness only by Schwartzberg's drumming, which is simply dreadful. However, no one in this lineup appears to have any real enthusiasm, slogging through one ragged number after another. The version of ""Nantucket Sleighride"" is so long that it soon becomes an exercise in pure tedium; it's a wonder that anyone in the audience was able to stay awake all the way through. None of the other cuts on this album is much better; in fact, the highlight is the moment during Leslie's ""Guitar Solo"" when a speaker blows; the rest of the album merely blows. This entire set sounds like a contractual obligation, and nothing more."
3,"Poor sound, good performance","If this is a reissue of the original Columbia CD, its sound is a pale imitation of the original Japanese vinyl edition. Columbia edited some of the songs and significantly brightened up the sound to the point of being piercingly tinny. Very sad, and I suggest searching out the Japanese 2CD mini-vinyl version released in 2008. That version, although very loud, is much less bright and sounds very good."
3,mountain to a molehill,"I loved Mountain, and I think they never got the respect orairplay they deserved but this double live album falls flatin too many areas. Leslie sounds great, but the other guysguitar is so badly out of tune and ragged that its hard to listento. Many of the versions are perfunctory, although some fireis raised at times. Mountain never made a great live albumwhich is really too bad. They deserved better than this whichshould have been titled "" Contractural Obligation"""
4,"Not the Peak, but , not a valley either","I remember when this 2 record set came out. I rushed home to play it on the ol Victrola and was dismayed to find no Corky and or Steve on it. I think I shelved it for years.With the advent of the bootleg series, and really poor Mountain live stuff available(except of course the wonderful ""Road Goes Ever On"")I checked the reviews here of this oldie. I thought I agreed with the negative ones here, but I dusted off the records and gave them another spin. Well I was pleasently surprised, yeah Sleighride is over long, but the recording is good, The band is tight, and Ya gotta love hearing Leslie and Felix together. I am going to order a CD copy of this one, it blows away the other available releases. Get ""The Road Goes...."", their 2 tracks on the Woodstock original soundtrack, Flowers of Evil and this one and you will be pretty well versed in Mountain how it was back in the golden days."
4,It's simple and long lasting,"Well made product with a good shelf life. It takes me about 4 months to finish one bottle, and during that time it has not shown any signs of crystallizing. Much easier and better quality than the homemade version that I used to do."
4,Why no version for Macintosh?,I love Hallmark and really want to buy this software but there is no version for Mac.
2,disappointed customer,I am using Hallmark card studio 2005 not the deluxe version. Maybe that would be better but this version is extremely limited to what you can do as far as the cards are concerned and their clip art leaves much to be desired. Prior to this I had Amercian Greetings Createacard platinum 8 and was in love with the flexability and ease of creating and found their clip art endless and wonderful. The disk I used just stopped working for me and I could not find an updated version so thought the good name of Hallmark would be better. Big mistake would not recommend the Hallmark version. I am only interested in making cards so don't care to pay for alot of things I do not use as in some of these programs. Sorry Hallmark but very disappointed.sandy
1,Very Very frustrating,"Purchased the Hallmark Card Studio ""005 Deluxe while visiting relations in California last year. Ordered in USA and so far have been sent 2 copies of this disc but does not work - shows up print preview and there is nothing on the preview and unable to print any cards - friends have also tried it and have been sent it twice and still have the discs unused - Unable to contact anyone and phone number given was hopeless kept hanging on and left message and didn't hear anything - can anyone help with an address - very frustrating as it cost a lot of money and my previous 3 editions all worked perfectly.Liz - Scotland"
2,I had trouble with installation,"I purchased this before it came out and had trouble installing. Sierra was able to walk me through the installion. I was able to use it for a few and all of sudden couldn't open it. The first disc would install in C drive, but the other two discs wouldn't. So now I am totally disgusted with it. The other Card Studios never were any trouble."
4,Hallmark print program,"It has many new exciting things, compared to my old program. I wished it had a few things different. It isn't real clear looking when you do a preview and you have to take it all the way as if you were picking it and if you don't like it you have to start over. That is the main dislike I have of it.But overall its a good progrm"
1,Doesn't work!,Got this for my Dad and he liked it at first. But it keeps choking and will not run. I've tried to uninstall/reinstall many many times--this worked once but no longer. Program just fails to load and stops responding. When it did work we could not get the card images to align properly on standard non-Hallmark cardstock. I'm looking for a replacement program but will STAY AWAY from Sierra/Hallmark programs! Even the latest versions have been reported to have similar problems.
1,Bad Customer Support,"I purchased this Greeting Card software to replace a treasured program that does not run on my new computer. The software failed to install and several long-long calls to ""Customer Support"" failed to help. They were difficult to reach and not very helpful. Finally after many struggles, I was asked to send them the first disk. I sent it. No response in 10 days. I fanally began calling again and on the third try got a response. That response? ""We are back ordered at least three weeks on those disks."" Extremely disappointing.[...]"
2,Be prepared.,This was to fit a 2005 Hyundai Santa Fe. It will but be prepared to remove the brackets( and have a little extra time on your hands) for the glove box as this product is one piece. The factory installed is a two piece and only requires lowering the glove box per Owners manual. They could have indicated it was a one piece. I dont think I will buy again. Just go to the Car Dealer and order one.
2,Does not work for 2005 Sonata,This Bosch filter stated it would work for a 2005 Sonata. It did not. It is a one-piece filter and the 2005 Sonata requires a two-piece filter.I also purchased a TYC 800018P cabin filter for my 2005 Santa Fe on the same order and it was identical to this Bosch filter. The only difference wasI paid $18.44 for the Bosch filter and $12.38 for the TYC filter. Buyer beware of this false advertising.
3,BOOZED UP WITH SEX,This is really not a bad album.It's probably their 3 rd best from the 80s right after Creatures of the night and Unmasked.It's 80s hair metal.A rather fun album.PARTY ON!
5,PERSONAL FAVORITE OF THE '80S,"Although either Creatures Of The Night or Lick It Up are frequently mentioned as their best output from the '80s, i think Crazy Nights is better.Why? Why not! It has some of the most catchy, hook-laden, memorable pop metal you'll ever hear.There is not filler (something present in almost every KISS album except for their debut).Musicianship and performance are both powerful and will induce a fell-good rush in every discerning music fan.I can't imagine anyone not liking this, but i'm sure such people exist.Highly recommended, quality KISS album, and a landmark in Music History.Not a time capsule by any means, just plain excellent, timeless material.I can only hope KISS will give the '80s more exposure in their live set-list.How about playing this album complete for it's anniversary, next year?"
2,this and hot in the shade are the worst turds kiss ever released,"crappy pop-hair metal. cmon they had to go to diane warren (the power ballad songwriter-for-hire) to write songs with paul on this one (at least on the elder, they brought on lou reed as lyricist, not some top 40 bland ballad songwriter like diane warren??)i bought this on vinyl back in the day but i do not expect to be re-buying or downloading this turd again. file under bad bon jovi wanna be. worst track is ""bang bang you"" and ""good girl gone bad""-just horrible caca lyrics and outdated eighties hair metal production. i will give it two stars instead of one because i save my one star ratings for caca like britney spears and other really horrible music that makes crazy nights sound like abbey road."
3,Average At Best.......,"This is an okay album, with Paul Stanley singing 7 out of the 11 songs on it. Bruce Kulick does a pretty good job on No No No (giving Eddie Van Halen a run for his money in the speed department) but sacrifices feeling for technique in my opinion. The mix isn't the greatest, there's not enough bass to blend with the guitar and drums. Was Gene Simmons even playing on here, or did he just show up to sing his 4 songs? We all know he did play, it's just not there sonically. Eric Carr did a good job with this, proving again that he is a better drummer than Peter Criss. This album is symptomatic of the corresponding period in KISStory, with Paul being the main reason the band was even around. Not the best album, but not their worst either."
3,Kiss with keyboards?,"Okay the keyboards were very commercial by 1987,but with Kiss it seemed they wanted to go back into a little pop phase again as like 1980's Unmasked. This is not a bad record by all means. Their are many catchy tunes including one of Paul's best ever ""Reason To Live"" his best ballad in years. The only reason this gets 3 stars is because of Gene's lack of focus. He seemed to have Hollywood in his mind instead of Kiss. His voice is by far the most non demonized ever on any Kiss record. This would only continue to falter by the Hot In The Shade album."
1,Kiss sounding more like Bon Jovi,"When ""Crazy Nights"" was released, I had just received my first CD player for my birthday. This was the second CD I ever purchased (Metallica - Garage Days, Re-revisited was the first). The rest of my Kiss collection was either on cassette or vinyl, and I was looking forward to my first kiss CD! But when I gave it a listen, I was disappointed by the lack of ""edge"" in the songs. Kiss sounded like they were trying to be Bon Jovi or Poison, two bands that I didn't much care for at the time. As a music trader, I ended up swapping this title for something else... However, I recently decided to complete my Kiss collection, and this was the only hole in the discography. If you are a completest, or enjoy late 80s radio friendly hard rock, this is worth the purchase price for a used copy."
3,Crazy Times,"By this release, Kiss was at another crossroad in their careers.They wanted to get away from the ""fashion metal"" of ASYLUM,but still craved a pop edge.What came out was an interesting experimental album entitled CRAZY NIGHTS.This release is a potpurri of good {NO NO NO,GOOD GIRL GONE BAD,REASON TO LIVE,TURN ON THE NIGHT} and the awful {FIGHT HELL TO HOLD YOU,BANG BANG YOU, HELL OR HIGH WATER,WHEN YOUR WALLS COME DOWN). CRAZY CRAZY NIGHTS became a big hit in the UK,and a minor hit here in OZ.The keyboards are an interesting ingredient to the mix.Bruce shows vast improvement in his playing style.CRAZY NIGHTS is a good,not great,Kiss release to add to your collection."
3,2.9,"KISS pretty much stumbled with this one, though it has a few good tracks (no no no, Fight hell.., When your walls.., Theif in the night) it is pretty poppy 80s stuff. The cheesy keybords dont help either. Sounds too polished for KISS, and even Gene left his balls at home on this. A lot of skippable tracks."
1,This epitomized what was wrong with Kiss in the 80's,"Crazy Nights was Kiss' lame attempt at sounding like such ""juggernauts"" as Poison and Great White. Why the band moved into this weak direction was beyond me. Every song in this album sounds the same and is limp. I am so glad that Kiss does not put this material out anymore."
4,A LOT MORE INTERESTING THAN THEIR 70'S STUFF...,"I BECAME A KISS FAN WHEN I FIRST HEARD THE SONG ""TEARS ARE FALLING"" AND EVEN THOUGH SOME OF THEIR 70'S STUFF IS GOOD (I.E. ""I LOVE IT LOUD""), I THINK THEIR 80'S MATERIAL WAS FAR MORE INTERESTING TO LISTEN TO AND HAD MUCH MORE INTERESTING GUITAR SOLOS. CRAZY NIGHTS IS FULL OF GREAT SONGS THAT YOU CAN SING ALONG WITH TO INCLUDE: I'LL FIGHT HELL TO HOLD YOU, HELL OR HIGH WATER, MY WAY, REASON TO LIVE AND TURN ON THE NIGHT. DESPITE WHAT SOME OF OUR ""CONTEMPORIES"" HAVE COMMENTED CONCERNING THIS ALBUM, I THINK IT IS SOLID WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A FEW SONGS - CHECK IT OUT FOR YOURSELF..."
4,USE YOUR OWN MIND/EARS,"I JUST FINALLY BOUGHT THE REMASTERED CD YESTERDAY AFTER WAITING TOO LONG! I PUT IT ON & IT SOUNDED AS STRONG AS I REMEMBERED. I'VE BEEN INTO KISS SINCE I WAS A KID,BUT REALIZE A LOT OF THE CD'S DO HAVE SOME PEE-EEWW TO THEM. I LIKE A LOT OF THEIR SONGS,BUT AS FAR AS CD'S GO,NOT A LOT ALL/MOST THE WAY THRU. THIS IS ONE ALONG WITH:DRESSED TO KILL,ALIVE II,ACE SOLO,GENE SOLO,ASYLUM,HOT IN THE SHADE,REVENGE,& CARNIVAL OF SOULS. I KNOW I LEFT OUT A LOT OF ""CLASSIC"" TITLES,BUT IT'S ONE GUYS OPINION. LISTEN WITH YOU EARS--JUST BECAUSE EVERYONE SAYS THOSE TITLES ARE GREAT & CD'S LIKE CRAZY NIGHTS ARE BE WEAK,DOESN'T MEAN IT'S TRUE. YOU BE THE JUDGE FOR YOU!"
4,Only one good song,"I only got this because of the song ""reason to live"" which is the only good song on this CD that is near impossible to find anywhere"
3,Come on and love me,"I actually don't mind this; I like that they were coming to terms with the decade they were in and more focused on making a good rock record than just 'being Kiss.' I like the digital recording's gloss; (it sure beats the hell out of pro-tools). 'Thief in the Night' is Gene's best song in years and Paul has one that hits a note of real poignancy. The rest of the lyrics are atrocious, but the music has a very high standard which is pretty heart warming. Look, latch key kids need quality music too, music isn't just for high society types who go to the symphony."
4,"An upbeat slice of ""late 80's flavored"" KISS","The sound on the record is very good . . . nice chunky guitar sounds at times and some fun 80's pop-metal. Gene Simmons is great as usual, and Paul adds an upbeat tone to the record. If you listen to KISS alot (like I do) you probably like the heavier stuff, but this is a nice break to mellow out with and still be listening to Gene and Paul. This is sunny weather music. Eric Carr's drumming is very good as always - as are Bruce's leads. GENE and KISS RULE - thanks for all the great tunes over the years!!!"
2,Poo Poo,When this came out I sold all of my merchandise and found heavier bands like Slayer to pick up the slack. Of course as a Ki$$ fan you end up re-buying and I must say that I do like the Gene songs but Pauls sounded neutered and falsetoed out which made me realise why I despised it back in the late 80's. Completion cd only...
2,Disappointment,"I've bought this book because of the high reputation Barrons has maintained in the SATs world. I recently took the June 01 Physics SAT II, and I now reflect. This book does cover most topics in detail; however, it fails to provide accurate model exams. Because the College Board has never released any copies of SAT II physics exams, Barrons was forced to put together the tests and the book blindly. Anyway, I read this book three times thoroughly and I have an A average in physics at school. This book is a big disappointment for this subject test.In fact, I went to [a store] the next day to see if any other prep book had an accurate model exam. Guess what? I found the Princeton Review book so accurate that it had about 14 similar questions from the test. So, buyers beware. Don't buy this book because you'll just screw up a SAT score. For this subject, buy the Princeton Review version. But, for biology and chemistry, use Kaplan."
3,"Topics are well explained, but the book needs a new edition","The topics are very well explained, detailed and full of exemples. But the kind of practice tests and sample exercices is far away from the SAT II test reality. While the book contains exercises that need mostly hard calculations and deep knowledge of the subject, the test is based on the most important physics concepts and reasoning, and calculations are rarely needed. Some answers to the practice tests are also wrong and badly explained. Anyway, if you don't rely on exercises, but instead on the concepts the book explains, you'll surely be able to get a high score, just like I was."
2,Try Cracking SATII series,"This book has poorly written, overly extended sentences making the information hard to understand. To top that off, calculations are made wrong in this book. An actual answer to a calculation was 68, the book claimed it was 77, and to make it even worst the books multiple choice answer was 80. I am in the middle of studying with this book and I'm EXTREMELY dissapointed..."
2,Disappointing book...!!!,"When I first bought this book , I thought that being Barron's it would be really good. But i found some very sub standard questions compared to the real physics sat2. Some topics are even out of the syllabus!!! To anyone taking the physics sat2, i wouldn't ever recommend this book as it just isn't good enough!!!!!"
1,"Terrible book, not at all like actual SATII","Lucky for me that a friend of mine gave me his Princeton Review book the day before the test, because that one review helped more than the 3 weeks I spent with this horrible book. Not only are many of the answers in the book wrong, but the test is nothing like the SATII. The questions are much harder in this book and almost every question requires calculations. On the test, you are not even allowed a calculator, and almost every single question is conceptual. This book also gives you an evaluation of ""good"" or ""fair""; it doesn't even have conversion tables of raw scores to the 800 point scale so you can evaluate yourself. If you need a book to prepare you for the Physics SATII, definetly get the Princeton Review ""Cracking the Physics SATII"" or anything else, just NOT this book!"
1,Definitely not recommended,"The convoluted explanations and completely inaccurate practice tests make this book pretty near worthless. The two weeks I spent going through it were a waste of time. Now, I'm going to buy the PR book and use that for review."
3,a decent review book,"While its practice problems may not exactly represent those on the actual test, they get you acquainted with the format and the types of questions you will likely encounter. My suggestion is to use this book to study for the modern physics portion of the exam, which some regular textbooks don't cover. For mechanics and E&M, use your own resources instead, as the barron's study book cover some trivial and unimportant information that will only serve to confuse you. Certainly don't just rely on this book to study off of."
2,Like many people who are so angry about this book~,"I have studied a lot of physics in the last few years, and I've eventually learned enough physics to get me through half of college - I even got a gold medal in the IPhO~As someone who have studied physics that much, I were able to understand what the authors have originally intended to do when they wrote this book. But not all people are using this book just for last-minute reviews. I'd say that without a complete understanding of basic concepts, this book would confuse you.The problems in the back aren't very close to the real tests, and I agree it contains a lot of errors. But if you have a firm basis on physics, and just want to solve some problems before the actual test, it's okay. It's a lot more difficult than the real one, so there won't be any surprises on the test day. Just use this book with some other one - this just isn't enough!"
2,Horrible,"Don't use this book to review or learn physics. It's pathetic. Concets are not clear; the topics are explained in vague words, instead of rigorous mathematical logics. Don't buy it unless you just want to solve some problems. I recommend AP Physics from Princeton Review, which is good for you to both learn physics and prepare SAT2 and AP exams."
4,Excellent start for an excellent series,"Now that I have heard the entire Dramatic Audio series of the first twelve Left Behind books, I have to say that I am impressed by the quality of the voice acting and the sound effects, plus how the adaptations remain pretty much faithful to the source material while adding a few things here and there. It's too bad the same couldn't be said for Cloud Ten Pictures' film versions of the first two books, never mind the fact that they weren't coming out as fast as I would have wanted for them to come out.This adaptation of the first book, Left Behind, is pretty good, though I noticed that there's some voice recycling going on -- particularly with the voices of Mac McCullum and Tsion Ben-Judah appearing on different characters in the first book.(Mac's voice would later be used on President Fitzgerald's aide in Tribulation Force.) Anyway, it's certainly worth checking out, and definitely better than Left Behind: The Movie."
3,Hard to Follow,"The Experience in Sound and Drama cassette was hard to follow for me. I drive a lot on my job and wanted something to listen to to keep me company. It's a good idea to try something like this as opposed to someone just reading the book, but it simply doesn't work. Some voices are so low you can't hear them and some are so loud that you have to turn the volume down. I purchased the regular abriged edition on cassette for Tribulation Force and found it much easier to follow, the reader is very good and changes his voice very effectively as he goes from one character to another. My grandmother is blind and she would definetly not be able to follow the sound and drama series,but would have no trouble following the regular abriged edition with the reader."
5,potboiler sci fi!,"this is pulpy sci fi like L. Ron Hubbard used to do. So, seems a lot of people disappear around the world, but this had been predicted Nosrtadomus-style centuries ago in a secret book. Some people know of this and know what they must do to protect thmselves and others, but some of the others dont want protection. There is a lot of suspense and subplots and over-the-top action. The whole thing is very imaginative and suspensful. it reminds me of LRH's Battlefield Earth saga."
2,not so Biblically sound!,"i was surprised at the way this book has been exalted! the authors talk about people vanishing and in that chaos, there's thousands of people dying on earth in accidents, plane crashes etc. now i dont have anything against the rapture and honestly believe in it. but i dont believe it would happen the way its told in this book. just imagine, why would God allow so many unsaved people to die in the chaos when His will is that none should perish?"
3,TittyBangBang,"The humor was lacking. Some parts were hilarious but most was dull.Thank goodness the disc came with subtitles, otherwise I would not have been able to laugh at the funny stuff."
3,funny and stupid,"This show is correctly compared to Little Britain, which for me means that a lot of it is stupid and funny, occassionally memorable even, but not as good as Fry and Laurie was or Mitchell and Webb or Armstrong and Miller. I ended up giving away my dvd because it wasn't really worth watching more than once."
4,Great CD ...but not readily available in the US,"I got this CD in 1999 but had to go to a shop that ordered imports in order to get it ! Worth the wait though ! It has alot of songs from alot of different genre's. I liked ""Are You Gonna Go My Way"" better when Tom did it on the Jerky Boys Soundtrack rather than the duet he does on this one. ""Sometimes We Cry"" with Van Morrison is great pairing two great voices together. ""Burning Down The House"" is good but one of my favorites was ""Mama Told Me Not To Come"" with the Stereophonics. Overall it's great seeing Tom put a different twist on older classics !! I recommend it to everyone out there who's a TJ fan !"
4,Reload to unload,"I grew-up being sightly revolted by Tom Jones. I didn't like how he looked (all hairy chest and weighted down with gold), sang, or conducted himself offstage, but alas I've changed my opinion. I heard ""Burning Down the House"" while on holiday in the UK in late 1999 and found myself rocking to the music. Then I heard ""Sexbomb"" and liked it even better, and that made me buy the album (or rather request it as a Christmas gift). ""Reload"" is all about fun! I love how this icon has combined his talents with some of today's hottest music acts (Robbie Williams, The Cardigans, Barenaked Ladies). It's a hip sounding musical effort that would be perfect party music. Anytime you need a lift from the doldrums, pop in ""Reload"" and develop a ""Lust for Life."""
5,AMAZING...,"I got this CD right after visiting Ireland... and I was so thrilled to listen to something that captured Ireland better than just the Irish Pub songs... Not that I do not like them, but this is just another WONDERFUL take on Ireland, not as hard as the punk sound, but definitely more in the rock area than the pub songs..."
4,"The more you listen, the better it gets.","With his strong, clear, controlled voice and his updates of traditional Irish themes of insurgency and romance, Dempsey places himself at the forefront of Irish pop music. Switches gears easily between wistful and militant. ""Colony"" and ""Patience"" are highlights for me, but there are so many good ones that anyone can find their own new favorites. Good ear filling."
5,Damien's got it all!,"Damien Dempsey's album is a collection of pain, politics and hope. His voice is so soothing and calm. ""Patience"" is by far my favorite song because it's got such a catchy chorus, but ""Spraypaint Backalley"" and Choctaw Nation are great as well. Damien's music is very honest, and his accent is fun to listen to as well! I think everyone who enjoys folk or acoustic music should pick up this CD."
5,This is a very helpful SPSS book,"I bought this book based on a recommendation from my advisor. It is a great way for SPSS users to find out how to go about conducting the analysis that they need to do. The help function in SPSS is not terribly helpful, and the manual that can be purchased for a lot of extra money is so large and combersome that it is also not much help. This book makes SPSS much easier to use."
3,Not as thorough as I had hoped,This book provides easy to follow step by step instructions but it is not as thorough as I had expected it to be based on past reviews. I ended up having to borrow a different SPSS text in order to get what I needed to complete the analysis.
3,Its okay,The book was in poorer condition than I thought it would be in and the disk that was supposed to come with it was not there.
1,Only for very basic statistics,I bought this book hoping that it would help me perform ANOVA for blocked and nested designs. Unfortunately it was completely useless. You would be much better off using (free) online resources. This book is a complete waste of money if you have a bit of a clue about how to do simple statistics.
1,More than Survival,"This book is more than a survival manual because it keeps you out of the deep water so you don't have to get in a situation where it's panic time. I found the book to give good advice and even the thinking behind it. For example, the section on missing data concisely explains the options and when to use them. Making the wrong choice here can definitely lead you into deep water. I also found the decision making process that Julie lays out for choosing the right statistic extremely helpful."
1,Pallant the Lifesaver,"Julie's survival kit on running stats was a big help. Step-by-step instructions on chi square and T tests were easy to follow. In fact, the overall reading of the manual was user friendly. I loathe ""stats"" because it loathes me, but referring to SPSS Survival Manual does make a ""significant"" difference. Si Yuus Maase from Guam."
3,Missing half of the Smash Hits,"The track listing on Amazon and when you import the CD doesn't match the actual songs or what is printed in the booket. I bought this for sentimental reasons, so really wanted the CD as I remember listening to the cassette. The CD is missing Red House, Crosstown Traffic, Remember and All Along the Watchtower. Wouldn't have purchased if I knew half of the Smash Hits were missing. I DO like the songs that are included: 51st Anniversary, The Stars that Play with Laughing Sam's Dice, Highway Chile and Burning of the Midnight Lamp - because yeah, it's Hendrix - but I really miss Red House and Watchtower and wish this was disclosed upfront."
2,Painful,"I bought this DVD with the understanding that it was a sequel of sorts to ""My Name is Nobody,"" which is one of my all-time favorite films. Sadly, this movie is no sequel, except for the fact that in both movies Terence Hill plays a larger-than-life character from the Old West with outlandish gun-handling skills. The humor that worked so well in ""Nobody"" is sorely lacking here -- the film is so bad that one cannot even find it funny as a satire on the spaghetti Western genre. The supporting cast is dreadful, the film quality is horrible, the plot is miserable, and the dialogue is laughable (when is the last time, for example, you heard a gunman call his opponent a ""booby"" during a gunfight?). The only merit to the film is that Terence Hill is fun to watch -- yet even he seems to trudging through this film -- Hill's half-hearted charm is the only thing that rescued this dud from a single star."
5,Great toys for animal loving kids!,"actually bought this toy to decorate a forest themed cake. It came out great. All of the kids fought over who got to keep or play with these toys. I bought several in this collection and they have ALL been a hit with ALLL of the kids from 2-12 so far ( I am a nanny and a vet tech and teach animal care and knowledge to all kids under my care.)They never stop playing with these toys. Would buy again, would recommend."
2,Preschool Teacher,Cute but misleading!!!! The animals are very small and not appropriate for young children!!!! The other pieces do not stay in their slots....had to glue them in and use larger animals from another set for it to be safe!!!!
5,Comfort Zone,"I bought this album when it was released in 1975 and bought it when it came out on CD. Song intitled ""Susan"" is in a word, comfort. I close my eyes and see him singing. I start to float listening. ""We Got By"" is so understanding. It feels good. I love this album. I just put it on and let it go. My favorite."
3,"Often inspired, sometimes perspired","3 1/2One of few male singers who is capable of carrying momentum solely based on vocal prowess (if occasionally strained or over-sung for individually modified lines), these warmly accessible (partially pandering) songs didn't hurt Jarreau's chances at creating a seismic sophomore."
5,tonka,"tonka, need I say more. well built, might have to replace a plastic part but so far it is pretty kewl."
3,Tonka toughs grader,I was disappointed that it wasn't better quality for the price I paid.I saw the same thing for $12. to $15. dollars cheaper other places so I thought this was better but it wasn't.
2,Not all metal,Not all parts are metal. The blade is plastic. Too pricey. Found exact same thing at Kohls for about $30.00 cheaper.
4,Tough Grader,"Tonka still makes a pretty tough toy as long as you are careful to pick the ones that are at least part metal like this one. Do look other places to buy this toy though, I paid half this price at Kohls online."
4,My grandson is happy with this toy!,"This road grader is a nice size and is well made. I seems to be a hit with the grandson. The only negative problem, and this is a something that I am going to have to fix, is that the grader blade, in its lowest position, does not make enough contact with the sand to do much grading. I think that I will probably need to pop-rivet on an additional piece of plastic or metal so as to extend the blade by about 1/4 to 3/8 inch."
2,not the toy of old,"The Tonka Tough Graders really isn't so tough, found an original at flea market all metal and is still around in good shape.The vendor was prompt with shipment and the toy is okay but won't last like the original one."
5,Tonka Grader,"This tonka grader has been well worth the price I paid for it! My Grandsons have spent hours playing with it. When they come to visit, thier Tonka toys are the first thing they grab. Thanks for making them so tough!!"
4,Well Made,"Nicely made toy looks like it will last a long time. The blade needs to be adjusted a little lower to scrape better. I'll bend the bar on it to change it, not a big deal. Thanks"
5,Tonka road grader,"This grader was a birthday present for my four year old grandson. I had ordered two others road graders that were made only of plastic, this one is metal. This grader should last for a number of years. I would rate this product five stars."
3,Factual account of Templar rise and fall,"If you want to read an extended dissertation on the Templars - then this is worth a look. The only criticism I have is that it is too conservative and skims over the extensive myths surrounding the Templars. Although it seems well researched - it almost totally ignores the more esoteric tales of the knights. If you want to read about the knights, the grail and mysticism.....then look elsewhere."
3,"Ahh, Couldve done better than that","The instructions that came with this filter were horrible and the pictures were blurry and pixelated, way to save money on ink ehh?Anyways, Price was no diffrent than that at ez lube, I suggest you get a new filter at ez lube, for 5 dollars more, they will install it for you, ford makes these things difficult and this price for this particular product is a waste of time, however item was shipped quickly and as stated, the instructions however were bad"
3,Nothing Portable about IT,This is a great book for history but not up to date and it weighs 20 lbs. so there's nothing portable about it.
2,BIG Texas Handbook,"This is one HUGE book. Very intimidating. I was looking for a ""handbook"" and not something this detailed."
4,"Easy read, great page turner","This book is belongs to specialized genre of high interest/low vocabulary books for young adults who cannot read easily or for whom English is a second language. Complex sentences and five syllable words are a no no. The goal is to entice the reader to turn the pages-something this author has accomplished with such great skill that even readers of average ability will enjoy this realistic, fast moving yarn about state troopers. The plot flies in more ways than one, as a teenage girl reluctantly moves in with her state trooper brother and becomes acquainted with a boy whose father is a helicopter pilot.I discovered this book the year of publication, when it was recommended by the American Library Association in a short list of only twenty of its kind.This is a great way to introduce a non-book reader to the joys of fiction."
5,For the advanced screenwriter,"If I were teaching Screenwriting, I'd assign four books in this order:1. Screenwriting 434. (A simple, non-threatening intro.)2. Linda Seger's book on character--more important than plot. I want to emphasize that in my course.3. Story. The best book on creating story. Good screenwriting really does require structure. It's almost never good to write it free-form. This book teaches structure wonderfully.4. This book, Crafty Screenwriting. It contains all sorts of clever tips and tricks on creating and then selling your book, which alas, may be more difficult than writing a great script."
5,"Keep a few, sell the rest, buy this book!","If you're on the fence about buying ""another"" screenwriting book to fill the shelves you already have crammed full, do yourself a favor...keep a few of those books (your favorites), sell the rest and use part of the proceeds to buy yourself a copy of this book. Crafty Screenwriting does what few screenwriting books do today -- it gives practical advice on getting your script written, read and sold. And it's entertaining at the same time!"
3,The Pro and the Con,"I'm a beginner who hasn't gotten much past a basic idea, a couple of characters, and a very rough plot.Pro: The advice of just writing an interesting script without getting all bogged down in traditional structure. I also like his approach that you're telling a story, so it's not necessarily a good thing to start writing until one can actually tell it aloud (at least to one's self).Con: The author does come across as arrogant at times. Not everyone is writing a whopping blockbuster Big Studio piece; his attitude towards anything less seems condescending.There's some great advice in here, but more for the mechanics than the creative process."
2,Cocky Screenwriting,"Mr. Epstein comes across as extremely arrogant from his first word, and it's hard to figure out why. He's had exactly one movie produced, ten years ago. He's primarily a development executive and TV writer.I've read twelve other screenwriting books in the last month, and Mr. Epstein quite often contradicts what these other books, written by very successful film writers and teachers, say about screenwriting. His way is better, he promises.On Mr. Epstein's web site he offers to critique scripts for nearly $500 each, saying ""That's what it costs me not to write."" This is an outrageous and doubtful claim.This book is the worst of a large crop of screenwriting books. Mr. Epstein can't even get the names of the movies and their characters right--it was THREE DAYS of the Condor, and Louise was played by Susan Sarandon, not Geena Davis.Spend your money on Syd Field, Lew Hunter, Linda Seger--or anyone else. Not on this book."
1,5 stars? Epstien's got a lot of friends voting for him.,The book is waste of time. It dwells on the type of screenplay you should be writing which if it was left of to this book we would all be watching movies-of-the-week and Lifetime originals. Buy the Writers Journey by Vogler or McKees Story. At least in those books they break down the craft so you understand it and can appopriate the information into the way you write. Saving your money would be the craftiest thing you could do with this book.
4,Crafty Screenwriting,"While Epstein's book is better than most on this subject -- most consisting of books that suggest a total outsider can write a screenplay this year and pick up his or her Oscar next year --'Crafty Screenwriting' still suffers from the fact that it's pretty close to impossible to break into the entertainment industry without knowing someone in it, and generally someone high up in it, who will sponsor you.If you want to know how competetive the movie industry truly is, stay in your seat and watch the end credits of the next film you see.Guess what? All those people have screenplays or outlines of or ideas for screenplays, and they're already in the business!Nonetheless, if you're crazy enough to want to try anyway, this book is worthwhile."
5,I'm recovering,"""Good Old Boys"" is a classic album. I lost EVERTHING due to the flooding caused by the inadequate levees built by the Corpse of Engineers. Katrina took everything I owned, including this album. I was very satisfied that Amazon could replace it."
5,an all-time classic.,"i have heard at least 7,000 albums in the course of life's mad journey, and this easily belongs in my favorite top 20. literate songwriting that few can match, along with superlative musical craftmanship, make this an all-time classic that belongs in every rock/pop music collection."
4,Another engaging Vogt novel,"It has the typical characteristics of Van Vogt, for better or worse. Thrilling concepts, a hyper-fast narrative, far-out depictions of science, aliens and political structures. Not up to the standard of the Null-A books or Voyage of the Space Beagle, but high above Vogt's worse. I found this a fast, engaging read. It also features the typical Vogt narrative of intellect, and a specific imagined intellectual disclipline (in this case ""the logic of levels"") triumphing over adversity. The gender depiction remains weak."
4,Love it,i love the bag. it feels like soft leather(maybe it is? idk). it's big enough w/o being bulky. & it looks good. the only thing i would change is that it would b nice 2 have a pocket 4 the cell phone. there is one inner pocket that can fit a few smaller things & then the main part of the purse is nice & deep.
5,"plain, but very solid","My first equipment rack. Very solid; might be literally bulletproof. I like the markers that divide the rack vertically into 1U units; much easier than counting holes to make sure things line up. Can be 22-38"" deep (and can even be adjusted after assembly, though I'd recommend not trying that with equipment in it); adjustments are also labeled to simplify lining up the various pieces required for the change."
4,Great Value,"This rack is a great rack for the cost. I wasn't expecting much compared to others but was pleasantly surprised. From the cage nuts and wire management that came along with the rack to it's ease of installation. Great value would definetly recommend.Only downside is the packaging. Box was very flimsy and by the time it got to me the ends had broken through the cardboard. You could tell the carrier, UPS, taped up the bottom the best they could during transit."
4,An Impelling Tale,"I thoroughly enjoyed Mark Graham's The Resurrectionist. The author vividly recreates the politics, corruption and racial tension of the 1870's, and the mystery he spins flows at a good pace. Philadelphia policeman Wilton McCleary, a Union veteren who survived the Andersonville prison camp, wrestles throughout the book with significant personal ethical issues - and Graham's framing of those issues - theological, racial, social and McClearly's own role in the corrupt Philadelphia police depatment - gives the character depth. I look forward to reading more of McCleary's struggles."
5,Worth waiting for & hungry for more!,"After reading ""The Killing Breed"" starring Wilton McCleary a few months ago, I waited anxiously for the next installment and worried it would not match the first. I need not have worried. ""The Resurrectionist"" is one of the best historical mysteries I've ever read. I love period detail, especially when one gets the sense the detail is well researched and factual. Add into the mix a very human, moral, sensitive, somewhat tortured detective and his battle with his own conscience and emotions as well as the ""establishment"" and biases of the time, written so well that one feels that one is actually reading Wilton McCleary's diary. Perhaps my only complaint might be that the story ended. I suspect I'll read it again--and once more await the next installment with anticipation. I feel Mark Graham's work is worthy of hardcover and more notice--although I really don't mind paying paperback prices."
3,"Hold me"" is most excellent, the rest: most non-triumphant!","i agree with those that love blue and pinkerton. Those were masterpieces and even the green album was poppy fun.I thought that maladroit was a huge decline in weezer's creativity. Make believe made me believe that weezer is just tryin to make money now and trying to make an image like every other big punk band nowdays. I did see some of their old emotion in ""hold me"" and íf not for that song i wouldn't have taken the time to listen to the album after hearing ""beverly hills."" Anybody that would love to see albums that mirror the blue and pinkerton probly will be disappointed with Make Believe, as they most assuredly were with maladroit....."
5,My dream has come true,"Weezer has come back with their fifth album and boy is this one amazing! 12 tracks, and all of them are spot on...you HAVE to buy this album, it is AMAZING!"
4,Weezer are a great band,"This album starts out great with the single ""Beverly Hills"" and continues to amaze with ""Hold Me"" and ""Pardon Me"" The only dissapointment is the second single ""We Are All on Drugs."" Very cheesy and not a well constructed song. It is not as good as blue or Pinkerton, but provides numerous highlights that need to be heard. This is a great band that appeals to numerous people. They put on a great concert and Rivers Cuomos is unique in a rock star like quality."
1,Oh Weezer,"Devoid of all emtional and musical flair from previous Weezer albums. Rick Rubin finally struck out at the production board. I understand why people might like this cd, but it baffles me. ""Beverly Hills"" wins the award for worst song and cheesy guitar solo of the year and ""We are all on Drugs"" seems like a parody of itself. Please people. Stop supporting bad music. I hope Rivers realizes he's wasting his time with crap music like this."
1,Awful.,"Why can't Weezer release another cool album like ""Pinkerton"" or ""The blue album"".This is even worse than their last ""green"" album that contained the annoying hash pipe.Do not buy this, its crap!"
2,Weezer - Never Blue Again in Pinkerton. Meditate on that.,"This album is by far the worst Weezer Album to date. The albums having been downward spiralling since the ""Blue"" album. It seems with each new album put out the worse it gets. Let's call it the ""Weezer Effect"" from now on. I had high, high hopes after Maladroit destroyed my self esteem, but this album has failed to prove anything - or maybe Rivers should just go meditate in his painted black room with some Tibetan Monks (no offence to any Tibetans or monks). I almost wish I didn't have tickets to tonites show - I don't believe I could ""stand"" to watch the show.Anyone want some tickets????"
1,In the Garbage ...,"is where this belongs,I can not find one good song.In the garbage is where it goes,why they wrote this crap, no one knows.In ... the ... garbage.In ... the ... garbage. Yeah!"
1,Where is the blue weezer at???,"Save your money and keep listening to the blue album. Thats what Ill be doing. Sticking to the blue album. At least we still have the classics. I wore out one copy of the blue album, and Make Believe won't get much play time in the CD player. If I wanted Emo, Id look elsewhere. Bring back the rock and the sense of humor. It has been a constant downward spiral from Pinkerton on. Shame really, because the Blue album is the one album I can't live without. Great music shouldn't have to grow on you. And with Weezer, I should be able to pop the CD in and sign along. Not the case with Make Believe."
2,Weezer for the new generation...,"Today the new album was out. On my lunch break, I jumped in the car and bought the cd without listening to it first, hey it was weezer. Sure the green album wasn't very good, but they reddemed themselves with maladroit.Well it was a mistake. Nothing can beat the blue album or Pinkerton and I wasn't kidding myself, no album could be better than those, but Make Believe is a disaster. I'd heard Beverly Hills many times during those last weeks thanks to Itunes and the sound was amazing. What a surprise when I finally heard the rest of the album. After a couple of listens, no song got to me. Even the green album had the merit to get my attention after 1 or 2 listens. I guess this album doesn't do it for me. For my part, I say it's their most boring album to date.I just hope they get their next one right !But hey it's just my 2 cents !"
1,this album sucks.,"i can't believe i actually fell for it again.weezer can't write a good album if their life depended on it. this album sucks. plain and simple. it's looking more and more like their blue album was a mere fluke.for the reviewer that said weezer is maturing, you obviously haven't listened to the album. they are trying so hard to recreate the blue album it isn't even funny. listen to the lyrics. listen to the choruses. in a word: bland. they're trying to dumb down their music to recreate an indie sound that just isn't there.they're a bunch of phonies.i would rather have them record more of their b-sides from 10 years ago than to listen to their new stuff now.straight up."
1,You'd have to be as imaginative as Peter Pan to like this.,"I'm a seventeen year old audiophile who has about 160, albums, and i can honestly say this is one of the worst that i own. Beverly hills is the best song, despite the fact that the lyrics bring them into simple plan territory. Not a single other song has good lyrics on the entire album. For example, take ""We Are All On Drugs."" ""When you're out with your friends in your new mercades benz, and you're, on drugs."" Okay, this is completely senseless and should not be coming from one of the greatest bands of the 90's. Green Album was weak, but Make Believe makes it seem as good as the White Album. I recommend checking out the band ""the Living End"" if you're interested in new uplifting rock music."
2,Don't Listen To Alan this album is terrible...,"This is by far the worst Weezer cd out there, I mean comeon what happened? I really liked Maladroit and the Green Album but this album isn't remotely listenable. The lyrics are terrible and it sounds like it was put together in one week. And to tell you the truth when I heard Beverly Hills I knew this wouldn't even be as good as Maladroit. The guitars arent as crunchy and I barely hear any solos on this disc except for Beverly Hills. I thought Maladroit was catchy as hell and better produced than the green album which was a goood thing. I'm being nice and giving this album 2 stars because I really do like Weezer and I think they can do better than this, but if they ever go emo I'm giving up on this band. Buy the new Audioslave album ""OUT OF EXILE"" it's amazing, there is not one bad song on that cd, also get SEETHERS KARMA AND EFFECT they both come out Tuesday and there both 10x better than ""MAKE BELIEVE""."
2,They used to be good.,"CD is boring... If you like mindless repeative music like in the Green CD. This is even more of it. Come on Weezer, you were a great band, what happened? If you want Weezer stick to the Blue and Pinkerton CD's."
2,Mediocre at best,"Coming off the strength of their prior work, the album lacks a lot of the wit and edge of previous albums. It's not particularly bad, and the music certainly is Weezer, but its disappointing."
2,Disappointing,"I was surprisingly disappointed by this album. What's up with the grade-school level lyrics anyway? At first, I thought they were just trying to be heavily ironic with such simpleton lyrics. I kept waiting for the ""a-ha, see we're just funnin' with ya"" moment of being let in on the joke, until I scarily realized that they were serious and this was the best they had to offer.Sounds like the boys listened to too many corporate suits for this one, and lost their edge."
5,No Pinkerton or Blue.... but right beside them,"This album definitely deserves credit. For one thing it is a whole lot better than Maladoit and the green album. Those albums had little artistic value. This album has an artistic value like Pinkerton and the Blue album, maybe not as much, but still it deserves five stars. So if you are new to weezer, I would buy this album, Pinkerton and the Blue album. Leave Maladroit and the green album for later."
4,Sort of reminds me of Pinkerton,"It has been a while since The Blue album and Pinkerton. Those days have come and gone. The green album and Maladroit were OK a handful of songs from both records would have been enough. I was not really fond of Beverly hills as the first single. After I listen to the album before it's release I was really let down, but I bought it and it has since grown on me.When I heard Perfect Situation I thought this songs is by far going to be one of my most favorite Weezer song's ever. This album has some great material on it and some OK stuff too but in a whole it is better than the green Oasis sounding album. Rick Rueben just rules."
5,KILLS GREEN AND MALADROIT,"there are some really great moments on this record. they put a lot of thought into these songs.it is not as good as blue or pinkerton, but is much, much better than green/maladroit.best tracks are: perfect situation, hold me, haunt you every day."
4,"no blue no pinkerton, so what","this is a good album, I had read so many bad reviews of this, that I was a little apprehensive about forking out my 12 bucks, but make believe is very good, strong songs, catchy guitars, what else could you want? this is not the blue album or pinkerton, but those two albums are in a class all their own, they are masterpieces, that being said, make believe is far superior to the no emotion green album and the worst weezer album maladroit. I'm not a big fan of the current single ""beverly hills"" but it gets good about from track two, and never really has a weak moment, there is even the cars sounding keyboards on this, very good weezer, hope they continue to make great music for years to come. if you dig their b side stuff like ""jamie"" and ""suzanne"", you'll like make believe."
1,This is not the weezer I knew.,"I feel like they sold out with this record but if that's the direction they wanted to go then so be it, that is their call. Listened to it once and then gave it to someone else. Though it was a waste of talent."
3,I wish it were make believe,"Wow, another disappointment from Weezer. Seminal groups will hopefully evolve musically and lyrically. Not weezer, they've been hanging out at the local junior high to find topics for their sonic narratives. I can only hope that I never am tempted to buy another one of their albums again."
1,"""Make Believe"" their 5th album was released in 03","I havnt waisted any time or money on this album. Hearing ""Beverely Hills"" and reading reviews was enough for me to know that River's is a complete coward and would never release another interesting song for fear that it might not click with the mainstream. The sad thing is that Rivers was about to show some guts shortly after releasing Maladroit. For the supporting tour they played songs mostly from Blue and Pinkerton and released a ton of really good songs on their website that were supposed compose their 5th album. They were on the verge of releasing the album but production came to a hault. Appearently Rivers had flash backs to 1996 and couldnt bare to release another cult classic. Anyway if you want to hear what should have been Weezer's 5th album try down loading songs like:""Mad Cow""""Prodigy Lover""""Hey Domingo""""Living Without You""""Modern Dukes"""
1,Rivers has completely lost it,"It is such a shame to know that the creators of such sublime albums as Pinkerton and The Blue Album have been reduced to this.People only give them good ratings because we want to believe it's the same old Weezer we know and love. The truth is if it were any other band releasing this uninspired, unthought-provoking,crap everybody would hate it. This is worse than Maladroit-even the lyrics suck. Rivers has completely lost it."
3,It's aight.,"The album is decent. I always hope for a more raw [but potent] production from my favorite bands. If it's too polished it lacks character for me. Maybe for the next album they should record with Brendan O'Brien [because I know better than Weezer, right]. I'm mostly disappointed with the bad grammar and spelling found in these reviews."
4,Weezer is BACK,"I didn't know what to expect of this album... I was highly dissapointed when the Green Album came out. After the emotional Masterpiece called Pinkerton, they could only make an album full with 3 minute pop songs??? Maladroit was even worse, I expected it to be the REAL fourth album, boy was I dissapointed. None of the songs did something to me.Believe me, I am a Blue fan. I love the songs on their debut. But it's Pinkerton that ranks as my favourite because of the powerfull melodies and the excellent guitar work.Make Believe, is a return to form. It has the emotion that the last two were lacking, and songs like ""Beverly Hills"" even remind me of the Blue album. The songs are all really catchy, and there's DIVERSITY. Sure, the overall sound is quite mellow, as the guys have matured quite a bit over the years. But there's so much beauty in a song like ""freak me out"", for instance.Pick it up, listen to it, and love it!"
4,Weezer!,"I like it!! I've been a Weezer fan since they had radio play. They were the first band I saw live, as openers for No Doubt. They've influenced many of today's up and coming bands. My favorite album is Pinkerton. I love the Blue Album too. The Green Album was fun. Didn't really get into Maladroit all that much. Bottom line: Weezer is dorky and goofy and some people can't appreciate that. Their music is fun and carefree and I'm happy with this album, since they kept their original sound. Catchy to say the least. I just bought it 2 hours ago-it's already growing on me-with the help of ""repeat."" I'm not much of a fan of ""Beverly Hills"" or ""We are All On Drugs,"" but that's just my opinion. I missed these ""honest"" songs, as were on Pinkerton. =)"
1,the saddest day of my life.,"I remember, a long time ago, I rushed to the store the day this came out, excited as hell, and went home and listened to it and crapped my pants in anger. I loved blue and pinkerton, green and maladroit were decent and had their moments. This has no moments. I listened to a probably twice a day the week I bought it, hoping I would find some redeeming qualities in it. I didn't. It got worse and worse. I have nightmares about it where 'we are all on drugs' plays over and over again. I'm not going to buy anymore weezer albums. I'll always have the first two. and all the memories."
3,I would love to give this more credit.....,"...but sometimes credit just is not due. This would be a great album coming from any other band. I am not going to whine and complain about how much not like Blue/Pinkerton this album is.Good strong music would have won me over, but not much on this cd stands out. It's sad that =w= thinks they can win over new fans with this, while neglecting theirs alltogether. Mabey there is hope for the Weez yet, I guess we'll wait 3 more years to find out.Album Highlights:Beverly HillsWe are all on drugsHaunt you every day"
1,Full Blown Terrible,"What is this crap? Weezers previous releases i loved (yes, even the green album and maladtroit) but this, this just straight up sucks, 85% of this is just lame emo/love songs, and the lyrics SUCK, i couldnt wait to hear it when i first got it, then after i had listened to it, i was so disapointed, i still like weezer, but lets do ourselves a favor and forget this godawful pice of crap ever happened, i want the old weezer back."
3,Make Believe it's good?,"I have to admit, I was really looking forward to getting this album. It was the first Weezer album I had ever purchased, and I did so because I loved all of the Weezer songs played on the local radio stations. I figured I couldn't go wrong on any of the Weezer albums, so I chose the latest release (after all it has that really cool 'Beverly Hills' song on it) The album was boring at best. It reminded me more of something a mediocre local band with very little talent and a little bit of money to record an album would produce. Sorry guys, it does pain me to give this review, but I wish I would have bought your first album."
3,Make Believe gets off to a good start...,"...but slowly loses steam as it goes on. The first track, Beverly Hills is a catchy song for now but I can see it becoming annoying eventually. Then come 3 great songs (Perfect Situation, This I Such A Pity, Hold Me) in a row. These are the kinds of songs that just don't get old. Peace is almost on par with these but not quite. Then comes the satire We Are All On Drugs, a humerous song but not that great musically. The album just kind of goes downhill after that though, as I was not impressed with the remaining 6 songs. still a good effort for weezer, as it definately beats out the green album and perhaps maladroit. but i dont see anything ever coming close to the greatness of blue and pinkerton."
2,Every ounce of personality has been squeezed out of Weezer,"Weezer's comeback albums have progressively devolved from ""shallow but well-crafted and fun"" to ""slapdash and clumsy but endearingly silly"" to ""workmanlike, trite, and lifeless.""These are serviceable tunes with no spark, no emotion, and lyrics so cliched that they subtract meaning instead of adding it. It's not even fascinatingly bad; it's just boring. Rivers Cuomo seems to have worked deliberately to produce the most forgettable, unremarkable, personality-devoid product possible, and he has succeeded.The clever but silly little power pop trifles on the Green Album were a letdown after ""Pinkerton,"" but this album makes Green look like the second coming of ""Abbey Road"" or something.Sad."
1,This Is Such A Pity,"This is the most disappointing album I have ever bought. I am (was) a huge Weezer fan and I think Pinkerton is one of the best albums ever recorded. But WTF is this? As soon as I heard the single, I had serious concerns - it sounds like Weezer trying to be Weezer, and it is boring and stupid. ""We Are All On Drugs"" sounds like something a bunch of 14-year-olds would come up with for their high school Battle of the Bands. It is really really really really bad. And the lyrics - my god. This album has no life, no soul, no heart. I think Rivers has been replaced with a robot. Weezer is dead."
2,Tell me it was all a dream,"Angst when you're over 30 years old isn't cool, it's pitiful. Grow the f*ck up.This album lacks any punch and those moments when it comes close fade away once an insipid lyric is attached. ""We Are All On Drugs"" is not tongue-in-cheek, is not ironic and borders on an earnestness that's almost Mormon--meaning, it's a lame tune. The rhyme scheme along pisses me off. The radio track ""Beverly Hills"" is non-threatening and sing-along (file ""The Damage in Your Heart"" here as well). ""Perfect Situation"" opens as a Weezer tune that sounds like it's a third-rate rip-off of a Weezer tune. And the 'ballad' tracks reek of psuedo-sentiment, like some Oprahish memoir.Is this what Weezer aspires to? It's just not what you want to hear from these guys. Make Believe sounds like a soundtrack album to a Kristin Dunst movie or a WB teen-drama, if you're into that love this album up."
3,What happened to Weezer,"This album is ok I guess. I was hopeing for alot more. I've been a fan of there's for years now and to hear this, I'm brought to tears."
2,Make Believe = Unimaginative,"Many of the reviewers seem to have accepted and embraced the fact that a typical Weezer song is mindless and repetitive. Why? If way back in 1994, Weezer had released Make Believe instead of The Blue Album do you think they would have a cult following, let alone be around 11 years later? It was their freshness and creativity that brought them popularity and it is soulless dribble like this that will lead to their demise."
2,An amazing substitute for sleeping pills.,"I got this CD back in May shortly after it came out because I liked the single... biggest mistake I've made in a while. The songs, with the exception of like 3, (1, 6, and 9) just have absolutely no energy at all, and the ones that do would have been good songs if they didn't have such corny lyrics. Let's face it people, ""you're my best friend and I love you, and I love you, yes I do"" are not good lyrics... well, I still say that Beverly Hills is an amazing song, but other than that and a few other perks here and there, it's definately not worth buying, or even burning for that matter. Sorry guys, but unless you wake up, I don't think I'm buying your next one."
2,Weezer not the same anymore,"I don't know, I really like the first three tracks, ""Beverly Hills,"" ""Perfect Situation,"" and ""This is such a pity."" But after that, the songs are total crap in my opinion. ""hold me"" is ok. But I feel that weezer has lightened up their style too much. I don't hear anything in this album that even remotely reminds me of the songs that made them bad ass and awesome- ""Hashpipe"" ""say it ain't so"" and ""the sweater song"". They were way more rockin back then. Now they seem like synthesized whiney little bitches. I'm sorry."
1,Smells Like Fish,"So after reading some of these reviews, I honestly can't see what people see (hear) in this album. Yes, the Blue Album and Pinkerton were incredible. The Green album was listenable. Maladroit--eh. Make Believe: a piece of dung, trampled on by a herd of elephants and then lit on fire. Yes, I think it's that bad. You'd think someone like Rick Rubin could do something with this. Who knows who's fault it is. But, this album in NO WAY ""evolves"" Weezer. I'm reading reviews of people saying we (old school Weezer listeners) can't accept that Weezer is ""all grown up"" now. No. This is definitely more immature than anything they have put out. Even the witty sarcastic lyrics are lost. Unless the sarcasm is so buried, it's not sarcasm anymore.The only exception is if their only goal is that each track they write for this album will make the next Reese Witherspoon romantic comedy movie of the girl who became a woman and persevered all the odds. Well then mission accomplished, Weezer."
4,"Mainstream, schmainstream","""Weezer is so mainstream now, blah blah blah"".Whatever.I myself hate with a passion radio, MTV, and anything else that promotes ""art"" based on how much money they are paid. But sometimes, very rarely, really great things can come of it.This album is one of those things.This album has a very different feel from their first, keeping in line with the typical maturity that comes with time. The textures are very eclectic, the pace is good, and the melodies intriguing.I've had a riff from just about every album in my head at some point during the day ever since I bought the album 2 weeks ago.If you've liked any of their other stuff before, then you'd like this one. Especially if you like Maladroit."
3,Good but not great,There are some good songs on this with some good guitar riffs and stuff but i have to agree the lyrics arent that great and i dont care if he locked himself in a closet that doesnt make what he wrote excellent it just shows that closets arent the best place for song writing inspiration. If you want a really great alblum get Demon Days which should be alblum of the year.
1,"SAVE YOUR MONEY, AND/OR TIME","I read Mr. Strathern's book while waiting for a movie- it took about 50 min. (missed movie, had to catch later one).There are many great introductions to Aquinas' thought, this is clearly not one of them. The author doesn't understand Aquinas and the caricatures presented are wopping pieces of nonsense. For those who want a reliable introduction to Aquinas' thought, here are a few suggestions: _The Thought of Thomas Aquinas_ by Brian Davies (1992, Oxford U. Press)_Aquinas_ by Anthony Kenny (1980, Oxford U. Press)_St. Thomas Aquinas_ by Ralph McInerny (1976, U. of Notre Dame Press)_Aquinas_ by Frederick Copleston (1955, Penguin Books)"
4,90 Minutes of Classic philosophers,"In Feb., on Maui, my wife found this book in our condo laundry room. and, I read it. I liked it so much, I have not only acquired it, but, most of the 90 Minute series. I keep reading and adding."
1,Anti-Catholic snobbery,"Assuming good faith, I'm not quite sure why this book was written. There's very little discussion about and explanation of Thomas' philosophy. Filling his book with put-downs from page one, dripping with sarcasm, the author comes across as a stellar example of late 20th century intellectual snobbery. If you're looking for a concise beginner's introduction to Aquinas' influential thought, this is not it. The only practical use I can think of for this book would be as fodder for a study of published modern anti-Catholic ""intellectualism."""
1,Condescending and sarcastic,"I am so glad I was able to obtain this book on loan because I can think of much better ways to spend my money. I was so hopeful when I started this reading that I would get a general idea of the philosophies of Aquinas. Obviously I did not expect to get to know him intimatly. What I got was a sarcastic and condescending review of a man who has greatly impacted the catholic church (the author claims that without Aquinas, the church may not have survived) and thus western civilization. I wish I had read the other reviews here first. The book presents itself as being biographical and unbiased but from page one you learn of the author's obvious distaste for Aquinas. I don't mind this sort of writing, only that I would like to know what I am in for. But worse, the books claims it will help you understand Aquinas but instead the author wanders off on barely related topics leaving me with no more information about Aquinas' philosophies than when I began."
4,another good time,"i own all of FPM's cds and this is a great addition to his discography. my only --minor-- complaint is a couple of the tracks get awfully repetitive. the most egregious example: ""king of pleasures"" repeats the chorus about a zillion times before moving on in what is otherwise a bouncy, feel-good track. nevertheless, this cd is overall an absolute joy to listen to on a sunny summer day. also note that this cd is copy-protected and may not play on some machines, esp. in your computer's cd-rom."
4,Pretty Damn good,Yu never know what you are gonna get with this group. I know nothing about them. Just heard the name here and there... found good songs on others' compilations. Thats it. but here we are with TOO. its nice. its rhythm without one gram of overwhelm. just a good balance of groove and smooth. :)
1,Bloody Awful,"It pains me to say so - with PFM being such an an institution of Jpop, but there is no denying that this cd is a stinker. The artwork is the only highlight.Having said that I've struggled through the cd only once. Can't bring myself to do it again."
2,"disappointing (luckily Lucinda still has it, just not here)","Like other reviewers, I think Lucinda is a fantastic performer who has written a lot of great songs. I'm afraid her singing on these live cds detracts trememdously from her songs and the capable playing of her band. She sounds like a worn out bar singer, and her vocals are really rough. Luckily, I saw her Fall 2005 and her voice is still fantastic... these recordings must have caught her on an off night."
2,Longtine Fan in Austin,"As a longtime fan I have to sadly say I won't be buying this one. Lucinda is a true genius. A god to singer songwriters. A big but here, the powers that be should have never released this one until her voice was in top form. Like nails on a chalk board some of the songs are unlistenable. I love you Lu but any of your studio releases are 4 stars beter than this. Check out the new Live in Austin DVD for some real singin'."
3,That voice...,"I could write quite a bit about Lucinda's songwriting and the musical muscle on this cd, but the main point here (and other reviewers have noted this, too) is that Lucinda's voice seems to be running absolutely wild. Her once subtle and evocative drawl has become an unleashed animal, and this worries me, as it renders her music nearly unlistenable at times. (Nowhere is this more apparent than on her duet with Costello on his latest release, The Delivery Man, in which she completely ruins what could have been the best song of the cd.)Hardcore fans will love this cd. Fans like me will like it when we're in our Lucinda moods. Newcomers will be scared off. Rein that voice in, Lucinda! Because this sweet ol' world is getting a little too sour for some of us."
2,Buy something else,"I purchased this CD by mistake. Lucinda did a marvelous live concert song that I thought was on this disc. Unfortunately, this show was recorded during her ""torturing a drunk cat"" singing phase. This work is only for diehard Lucinda fans who think she can do no wrong."
3,"Like others have said, Buy the DVD","I agree with most other reviewers who prefer the DVD just released of an Austin City Limits concert from 1998. The songs come mainly from her best cd, Car Wheels... That is the CD that introduced me to Lucinda (and my favorite). The DVD concert has much superior singing and more interesting music. Oddly though, when I first saw the Austin City Limits concert when it originally aired on TV I didn't really like it because Lucinda seems a little distant as she sings, rarely cracking a smile or showing much emotion. Still, after the last 2 albums of dark, somber songs I find it refreshing. I am in the process of recording the DVD audio to CD so I can take it with me. Back to the Fillmore concert. There are some gems on these 2 albums. I really like the versions of ""World without Tears"" and ""These Three Days"".I personally hope she goes back to more story songs."
4,Linda Should Always Record Live,"Lucinda Williams' latest 2-CD release, 'Live At The Fillmore', makes a strong case that all her albums should be done live. Consisting of selections mainly from her last two albums, this dramatic recording presents her songs in a harder-edge voice with her blues background to the fore and with her tight band offering just the support she needs. Additionally the words are easier to hear - especially relevant for 'Bus To Baton Rouge', her signifying song about her tough upbringing. The album has many highlights, enough to further cement Williams' reputation as one of the US' greatest songwriters and live performers. 'Live At The Fillmore' is an excellent introduction to those who have been previously interested but have not yet purchased."
4,Great artist but where are the songs????,"I love Lucinda and her style but this was a chance for her to show those who have missed what a treat she is live. Unfortunately, she has so many great songs and many are missing here. No Passionate Kisses, Cars Wheels on a Gravel Road, or even her sensational cover of Love Hurts. With only 22 songs, there should have been room for a couple of more. Oh well, you have her live and I guess that should be good enough."
5,"Dark, gritty honky tonk music",I've never really been a big fan of Lucinda but wanted to give this Fillmore release a chance. Glad I did.She delivers each song from the soul and she's surrounded by a great band. I won't say this is a lot of fun to listen to - you sort of go through experiences with her - but she may be one of the best story tellers out there and each of these performances tells us a little more about this fantastic singer.And for those who haven't listened to much of her music this isn't straight country. There are jazz and rock sounds going on here.This is a nice release that's well worth the money.
5,Astonishing...,"When I first heard ""Change the Locks"", I could not believe my ears. This is one of the most thrilling live recordings I've ever heard. Yeah, her singing is raw and yet you can hear every syllable. Just the way she sings ""change-the...CAAAARRRRRRR I drive"" blows my socks off.So angry and yet so...so...sexy...And those dueling, twisting, bending guitars. Keith Richards would be proud. I can't wait to hear the rest of the album!"
4,What a live recording should be!,"ok...I'll be the first to admit that I'm not really a big Lucinda Williams fan. I enjoyed ""Car Wheels"" so I thought I'd give this live set a try, not knowing what to expect. WOW, what a raw emotional ride you get taken on with this double cd. She gives a consistent performance throughout the recording. I read some of the other reviews and yes, there are some less than perfect notes but hey so what! If you want perfect studio recordings get her other records and and piece together the track listings on your ipod. I remember thinking this may be the best live record since Zevon's ""Stand in the Fire""."
5,"Lucinda Williams ""Live at the Filmore"" 2 Disc CD","SIMPLY OUTSTANDING!!! This is one of the greatest ""Live"" album double cd's that I am aware of. It can only be compared to ""the Allman Brothers Band - ""Live at Filmore East"" back in the days of the late Duane Allman, and ""One More from the Road"" by Lynyrnd Skynyrd recorded at Atlanta's Fabulous Fox Theatre back in the days of the late Ronnie Van Zant.It consists of 10 live songs on disc 1 and 12 live songs on disc 2. This one has been reviewed alot,so I'll just point out some songs that really stood out for me:Disc one: ""Fruits of my Labor"", ""Sweet Side"", ""Lonely Girl, and ""Changed the Locks"" (This is one is very, very, very GOOD!!!!).Disc 2: ""I Lost it"", ""Pinola"", Rightously, ""Joy"", ""Real Live Bleeding Fingers"", ""world without Tear"", and ""Bus to Baton Rouge"".THIS IS A TRUE MASTERPIECE, AND I HIHGLY RECOMMEND IT!!! THANKS AND GOD BLESS!!!"
1,Had to remove these discs from my truck today...,"I have been trying to listen this album for some time but it's intolerable.I listen to Lucinda constantly, have for years, she is a wonderful and soulful artist, I certainly dig her whole style and groove but this performance is just depressing so out of my life it goes. It really upsets me to hear her sounding so bad, it is puzzling how this performance was so bad and why it was released! We should have been spared this."
4,lovin lucinda live...,bought this cd set used...would be a 5 star if the cd werent scoured...oh well..ripped to my mybook with no trouble so now they are safe almost forever...if you're a lucinda fan you know all the songs but the arrangements and raw energy make this great road trip music
3,Could've done better,"I am a huge Lucinda Williams fan, and love all phases of her music. I saw her at the Fillmore in April of 2002, and enjoyed the show. That said, this album was a disappointment as far as her work goes (though not bad in the realm of music in general!). Not only does it sound like she is trying too hard in the singing, but it does not have the feel of a live album. For one thing, it sounds like it was recorded in the Fillmore (fancy that)--flat. For another, it doesn't have any of the artist-audience interaction that makes a live album so interesting as a window into another aspect of the artist's abilities.I think that this album sounds the way L.W. wanted it to sound, which is enough for most people, and of course the lyrics and songs themselves are wonderful. But it does not rival the live concerts that I have heard her play nor live recordings that I have heard from other shows."
3,Adequate,"A good listen, but in many cases the studio versions of these songs were more satisfying to me. I thought a strange thing was going on with this recording. On one hand, the vocals sometimes didn't show enough restraint and went to some place beyond the rawness that we like from Lucinda. On the other hand, the band showed too much restraint much of the time - they duplicated the studio sound well but didn't really tap into the kind of extra energy that a live show can convey. This dynamic works alright on the more low-key songs that start disc one and finish disc two, but it falls down on the faster/harder songs in the middle of the set.Lucinda fans will buy it and like it well enough (I did and do), but..."
3,Not sure what to say,"This is a good live recording, but owning better live bootlegs of hers, and having attended better concerts of hers makes me wonder who decided what got put in this release and why? It took me a long time to shell out the bucks for this, and had I read the reviews on Amazon first, I probably would have spent the money on something else. Lucinda still makes me weak in the knees and I'll still buy the studio stuff and certainly keep going to the shows. The Fillmore might be legendary, but her performances in Houston far exceed what transpired on these San Francisco nights."
3,harsh sounding but intense Lucinda,"Lucinda Williams is a brilliant songwriter and an entertaining performer. However, this intense CD couples a particularly depressing set of slow songs on the first CD (even by Lucinda's standards) with harsh vocals on many faster-paced, but intense songs on the second CD. I don't think Lucinda is losing her voice; it sounds OK on a few songs. Rather, her raspy shrieks and growls seem designed to wring more pain from these angst-ridden songs. This does make the sets intense but probably won't make this be a CD I play very often. Her vocals are paired with pretty heavy electric guitar laden with feedback and slurred notes, an effective sound for the lyrics and vocals. If you aren't familiar with Lucinda, definitely start with studio albums (my favorite is ""Car Wheels on a Gravel Road"") with more understandable lyrics and melodic tunes (but plenty intense themes)."
5,luicinda live rocks !!,Lucinda live has an energy about her that makes her songs have strong feelings and real meaning. This album capures the essance of her concerts.
2,puzzled,"I've been a Lucinda fan for many years. In my mind ""Car Wheels on a Gravel Road"" was her finest hour. I kept buying the studio albums up through this release ... and then I gave up. Honestly, I find the collection of songs on this concert collection very boring and lethargic. Certainly not the sort of heart and soul that moves me. I really tried to like this one but it kept making me drowsy so I sold it to a used shop. By contrast, I found the live material on the new Deluxe Edition (2-discs) of ""Car Wheels"" to be wonderful."
5,passionate and visceral,"Anyone who has seen Lucinda live when she's really cooking knows just how much of a passionate and visceral musician she really is, and needs to be. As soon as she feels audience warmth she puts out everything she's got even after a long haul on the road and this album is live proof. She recorded many performances in North America before settling on these nights at the Fillmore. CD 1 seems more intense and on the desolate side of her muse; whereas CD 2 is definitely raunchy and playful - with her incredibly tight band putting it all out with her. Her sense of herself, the people she's known and her surroundings is her great strength in her writing and performance and this uniquely arranged live masterpiece hurls fire."
5,my husband loves this jelly!,bought this for my husband for Christmas and he LOVES it!!! his mother made chokecherry jelly when he was a boy. he said this is almost as good as his mother's :)
4,Looking at what infinity means,"Explains a difficult and strange subject clearly and is amplified by associated and delightful drawings that illustrate and translate the mathematical points into artistic impression. The authors proceed slowly, step by step, and the work does not require advanced mathematical knowledge, just the ability to open the mind to different and new ways of understanding concepts."
1,Yet more filth from Christian Kim,"Christian Kim has really excelled himself with this poetry collection. The poetry is abominable and the content completely ridiculous. From reading these poems, I get the impression that they are the work of a madman, who is fixated by Jews and Judaism. Christian Kim blames Jews for the September 11th attacks on America and just about everything else. This book is very boring and represents poor value for money - please avoid!"
1,Poetry of the worst kind!,'Going the Distance' is typical of the appalling literature Kim churns out year after year. The poetry is simply awful and the content is dull to say the least. The main theme behind these poems is the idea that the Jews were responsible for 9/11. Kim also seeks to incite Evangelical Christians to rise up and fight Jews wherever they find them. It is clear that Kim uses poetry simply as a vehicle to convey his religious bigotry and unpleasent political views. I would steer well clear of this one.
1,terrible,"This is the worst poetry I've ever read. Kim seems not to have a clue about what good poetry entails. The style of writing is monotonous, rather like that of a boring old man, who rants and raves about inane topics. The poems are awkward to read in that they do not flow well. I found some of the content nonsensical e.g. one of the poems suggested that the Jews were responsible for 9/11. We all know that it was Muslim fundamentalists lead by Osama Bin Laden, who carried out the atrocities of 9/11. The quality of the poetry is so low that unless you are looking for a joke birthday present for someone, I wouldn't purchase this book."
1,"Uninspiring, Dull and offensive!","This has got to be the worst poetry book I've ever read. The standard of poetry is abominable; it did not flow and lacked inspiration. I found these poems incredibly dull, dreary and frustrating to read. The messages conveyed in this poetry book were rather unpleasant e.g. Americans' and Christians' must drop a nuclear bomb on the Middle East and Israel in revenge for 9/11. It seems to me that the author is an angry and insecure individual, who seeks to vent this anger in the form of attacks on Jews and Muslims. Please avoid!"
1,Really bad!,"I was really let down by this poetry book; it wasn't what I was expecting at all. The poetry conveyed mixed and often confusing messages not helped by the poor standard of English. Some of the poems were downright racist and would cause offence to most readers. Through his rather poor poetry, Kim, emphasises the need for revenge and intolerance rather than encouraging a peaceful solution to the problems posed by 9/11. It is disappointing that Kim seeks to encourage a negative response to this tragedy. In some of the poems, Kim seems to condone the actions of the Muslim fundamentalist terrorists, who carried out the attack. This is likely to be upsetting for those who lost loved ones on 9/11; therefore I would advise that they avoid this poetry collection. This book was a total disappointment; it does nothing to ease the suffering of those who were affected on that awful day."
1,Dire,"When one starts to read through these poems, one becomes nauseated as a result of the extreme racism and anti-Semitism. Furthermore, one becomes increasingly frustrated due to the poor quality of the poetry and numerous typos.Kim's poetry is unimaginative and reads as a series of bitter rants about how the Jews were allegedly responsible for September 11th. Many of Kim's poems condone the actions of the Muslim fundamentalist terrorists who perpetrated the attacks. This is likely to cause a great deal of offence to those, who suffered on that fateful day.I concur with most of the reviewers, when they say that the messages conveyed by Kim's poems were confused as a result of the poor grammar.This really is poetry of the lowest standard. The author should seriously reconsider his decision to become a writer."
1,Terrible poetry intertwined with dangerous messages,"When one starts to read 'Going the Distance', one finds the most appalling poetry conveying the most hideous messages imaginable.The poems were simply awful. There was no flow to the poetry and the author's choice of language was poor. I concur with many of the reviewers who say that the poems consist of a series of bigoted rants. It seems to me that Kim is using poetry merely as a tool to make his extreme political views seem more palatable.The content can only be described as utter dross. Some of the poems were rather weird and others were downright offensive (anti-Semitic and racist). This poetry collection should be given a miss."
1,Not a big fan!,"Heerak's poetry is the worst I've ever read. His style is very boring, rambly and repetitive. This poetry collection is no different. Through these poorly written poems, Heerak tries to give the impression that Christianity is superior to all other religions. This idea is clearly repugnant to Muslims such as me. Heerak should be more sensitive to people of other faiths. I think he should give up on his writing career and go on a 'diversity awareness' course to help him overcome his racism.Avoid!"
3,End of an Era,"This is the last KISS album before the reunion before they put the makeup back on again. The music itself is hard rock in the vein of Revenge, except unlike that album, the songs here are less memorable. This was recorded with Bruce Kulick on lead guiatar and Eric Singer on drums. Singer has since took on the role of the Catman on their most recent album, Sonic Boom. It was going to be released in '95 or '96. With the reunion this album was shelved and Kulick and Singer given their walking papers. It became a high prized bootleg, leading to its release in 1997. Not a bad addition to any fan's collection, but the overall lack of memorable songs bogs it down."
1,Let It Be,"How this album can get such great reviews is beyond me. It a piece of crap that should not have been released. KISS do grunge? Yeah I like to see that. The vocals are ok and the lyrics to each song are just ***. Save your time and money and buy eariler Kiss music, the stuff that rocks"
2,Dissapointing,Kiss did not lend very well to the grunge sound. This does not sound like Kiss at all. while other albums that they made were influenced by other types of music you could still hear Kiss shining through. I could not hear Kiss in any shape or form in this album. It is the worst they ever attempted. Thank God that Ace and peter came back briefly to derail this direction they were headed in.
1,KISS at their best ...,"... which means as pathetic sell-outs.As a long-time member of the KISS ARMY, I know what it means to be disappointed. And this album does it. I felt so used afterward, like I was just making them rich or something.New material? Forget it. Honouring the dead members of the band? Yeah, right.Avoid!"
1,The Worst,"I own them all...this is the worst. Kiss' attempt at grunge/very very heavy rock. Uhh, it is so bad except for 1 or 2 songs which are tolerable."
4,Are you a Kiss fan?,"If so.. you already know that this is a good, if under appreciated album.Pick it up, listen to it... you will like it."
4,Kiss' Take on Alice in Chains,"How anyone could say that this is NOT a grunge style album is beyond me. ""Rain"" and ""Hate"" are so reminiscent of Alice in Chains type music (even down to the song titles). So is ""In My Head."" So Kiss was trying to match a musical style of the moment. Take out Gene and Paul's voice, and the music is DEFINITELY grunge in style (of the heavier Alice in Chains mold). Throw some Danzig in there, too (like on ""Master & Slave"")... granted, not grunge. Say dark bluesy metal... but that's also Alice in Chains corner of grunge. There's nothing wrong with Kiss being influence by these styles. At the time, other older artists were dabbling, too. For example, David Bowie with Outside, with obvious NIN influences.So again... maybe saying ""grunge"" is too broad. But Kiss' take on Alice in Chains? That nails it. And to be honest, it's pretty interesting to hear."
3,Too Grungy,"Decent music overall, but not what I'd expect from KISS. If you're a true-blue fan, buy it. If not, save your hard-earned money."
3,An experiment with mixed results,"In my mind, Revenge stands as the last great KISS album. It had a great sound and much more interesting content than typical KISS fare. A bit of that carries over to Carnival of Souls, but the sound is much heavier, almost grunge like. No doubt Simmons and Stanley were at one point hoping to make a quick buck by exploiting the sound of the time, but by the time the album came out grunge had long come and gone.In my opinion, the standout tracks on Carnival of souls are those written by Gene Simmons, the best being Childhood's End. Hate, Seduction of the Innocent, I Confess, and I Walk Alone are also enjoyable, and work much better than Stanley's efforts.Carnival of Souls is a long way from classic KISS, and it's most likely not going to be enjoyed by the casual KISS fan because of that. None the less, it remains an interesting experiment with a few gems."
1,FECAL MATTER!,Like Kissco was'nt bad enough. This is even worse. It drags on & on & on. Like a bad hangover. Save your $$$$ & buy some classic Kiss or an Ace Frehley album.
1,This is horrible,"No wonder it was unreleased for a while and recenly out of print (about to be re-issued). This is Kiss trying to be someone else. Both Gene and Paul made fun of the seattle sound back in the day and this is them trying to copy that style.Kiss has always been known as a party/good time band. Well, on this record they're pretending to be angry the whole album. It sounds fake.Do yourself a favor and save your money. You won't regret it."
1,What the HECK?!?!,"What was KISS thinking doing an alternative album?!?! ""Hate"" is the only redeeming song on this alternative piece of crap!! Only Nirvana fans will like this one!! After playing this in my CD player, I had to give my CD player a quick dose of ""anti-suck"" in the form of ""Duece"". THANK GOD my player works still. What's with that cover?!?! That's THE worst cover I've seen on a KISS album!! AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS!! Unless you're collecting the entire set of KISS CD's, like me. It's better used as a drink coaster!!"
2,Don't Waste Your Time Or Money On This CD,"This has got to be Kiss' worst album ever! Why? It has absolutely no energy or excitement anywhere on it, unlike their previous album, ""Revenge"", which was just heavy as hell and rocked. Most other Kiss albums were really fun to listen to, with only a few exceptions, like ""Dynasty"", ""Unmasked"" and ""Crazy Nights"". ""Carnival of Souls"" is just plain dull & boring. I'm sure the band thought they were being clever by doing something different, but instead they were following somebody else's lead instead of being leaders themselves. The songs here are depressing as well. It must have been raining outside the whole time they recorded it. They even look bored themselves on the cover photo! The one & only pleasant surprise on here is ""I Walk Alone"", which, amazingly, was sung by guitarist Bruce Kulick. If you're new to the music of Kiss, do yourself a favor and skip this one."
2,crap,"It is okay to go in a slightly different route musically. But if you must, do it in a way that doesn't suck. What kiss should of done if they wanted to go in a different direction was add just a little bit of the grunge. But unfortunately they added too much and they sounded horrible. Also the one song that seemed like it would of been a good song was ""I walk alone"". But it got ruined by Bruce Kulick's crapy singing. Kiss should never atempt grunge again because they suck at it. I'm glad that they went into a more rock sound with psycho circus. I thought that was a good album a whole lot better than this garbage."
5,I loved,"This is one of the best KISS albuns - Este é um dos melhores albuns do KISS. I realy loved and I think that Bruce Kulick and Eric Singer are very good musicians - Eu adorei e acho que Bruce Kullick e Eric Singer so músicos excelentes - If someone asks me with cd I can hear 1000 times , I would answer: CARNIVAL OF SOULS. Se alguem me perguntasse qual CD eu ouviria mil vezes eu diria: CARNIVAL OF SOULS. IT IS THE BEST . BUY IT NOW! - COMPRE AGORA!"
5,Record Review.,"I feel this is one of the best Kiss albums out there today, and why shouldn't it be? Kiss changed their style on this album, which a lot of their fans hated, but let me ask you, If all the fans hated the album so much, how can you call them real fans? I thought fans we're suppose to stand behind a band, no matter if they make an awful album, or a good album. Ok, so it isn't ""Destroyer"", Or ""Love Gun"", Etc. I'm glad it isn't any of those, because as far as I'm conserned, Kiss needed a change for a long time, and needed to quit singing about how many girls they could sleep with in one night, etc. I really don't care about the sexual life Of Gene Simmons Or Paul Stanley...I'll I want is good music, and I got It on this album. Too bad ""Psycho Circus"" wasn't the same way."
3,Not Kiss,"Not a bad album...but feel like I'm listening to Kiss, under the influence of Alice in Chains. This isn't ""Kiss music"" in my opinion.The ""Kiss sound"" was constant and similar from 1973 up until Ace left the band after the Elder album. Without Ace's basic rock influence and Les Paul/Marshall sound...its not the same Kiss."
2,Ugh.,"I'm old school. I like the original three. I liked Alive! and Destroyer. I started getting uncomfortable during the Hot in the Shade/Unmasked period. This album is heavy on songs written by Gene. You can tell he manufactured the thing from beginning to end. (Not that that's entirely bad, I happened to like his solo album, and ""Going Blind"" might be my favorite KISS song.) But here he seems to want to capitalize on that Alice in Chains-Soundgarden vibe, and it just ends up coming off so derivative and kinda pathetic. Quite frankly, it's a little Rob Halford-esque. KISS is SOOOOO much better than this. I long for the days of ""She's a dancer, a romancer/ I'm a Capricorn and she's a Cancer..."" and ""Baby, baby, don't ya hesitate, cuz I just can't wait..."" Humor. Fun. Remember them?"
1,Too minnie,Was really disappointed when I received this - it is useless to me. I didn't realize that it was a mini version -I never would have ordered it.
1,Feng Shui for Dummies,I laughed out loud when I got this book in the mail. Lesson learned...from now on I will read ALL descriptions MUCH more carefully! I was FULLY expecting a FULL sized book but got this tiny thing. Felt like I was dooped but checked and it does clearly say Miniatue Edition. Live and lern.
2,Don't Waste Your Time,"Or Money... JUnless you need to see some mildly attractive older woman chopping off fingers, noses and shooting anyone and everyone for little or no reason...totally stupid piece of S***"
2,Watch in Fast Forward,"While it tries to follow in the footsteps of Snatch and Lock Stock, it fails in every respect. The introduction of too many characters and a poorly constructed story to save time this movie should be watched in fast forward."
4,Where'd that Cat Run?,"I do not recall ordering this product nor seeing the film, but if Amazon says I did, I must have. It must have been a rip-roaring good time and I'm sure Ms. Vega turned in a stellar performance. After reading the other reviews, I wish I remembered seeing it!"
2,Don't run to this,"Hard to follow and somethimes figure out what the heck is going on. Entertaining at times, but not a great movie."
1,Cornball,"So cheesy. Even the cover is lame. I'd rather watch paint dry. Or better yet, use this as a coated (shiny side up)."
3,Entertaining action movie,"Decent action movie... a couple of amateur guys start a detective agency and help a damsel in distress. Entertaining, worth a watch..."
2,Religious,"This is a very sweet story, but I was surprised about the reference to Jesus and God. The author writes about Mr. Keller and how he thought about the many times God had come to him in love. At first Mr. Keller ""had pulled back. Then, one day he trusted Jesus and gave Him complete control over his life."" Or another example: ""Am I willing to go where the Lord sends me, no matter how hard it seems? Am I as happy and eager to obey God's commands as Lass is to carry out mine?""This may be exactly the way you wish to teach your children or grandchildren, but just be aware of the religious content in the book since it may not be for everyone, and it isn't appropriate for public classrooms where there may be children of various backgrounds and religions."
4,informative,"I'm putting together a wargaming Early Imperial Roman Army. I have found this book to be useful in providing detail about all the areas in the title ""organization, tactics, dress and weapons"". The sections on dress and equipment can be a little tedious but provide an excellent reference. I enjoyed the section on the major battles of the period but found the descriptions a little short, but that I dare say is another book in itself. As a general reference for the period the author has done an excellent job."
5,The best DVD I've ever seen,I have been a fan of Loreena's music and songs for many years. I was looking for such concert for a long time and my dream came true. Unfortunately I was not able to see her live performance. But yesterday I received DVD and two CDs. It is the best DVD I have ever watched. Her music and voice are something beautiful. If you add Alhambra's mystical spirit the result is something amazing. This journey takes you to the wonderful world of music and you won't forget it. Music goes directly to your soul. Believe me.
5,celtic queen strikes a chord,Loreena McKennitt once again shows why she is truly the queen of celtic music as well as the local flavor of where ever she travels. This is a splendid collection of new and old. It is fun to listen to the CD's as well as enjoying her concert performance.
5,wonderful,This CD is one of her best. She is one of the only artists I know that is better live than recorded.
2,ummmmm,I didnt get the dvd with the cds so obviously im dissapointed that I paid for it and it was a no show.
2,Many Mistakes,"The concert itself is quite nice though i heard much better arrangements for some tracks in former years. The drums are quite weird in that sort of music for example (remembers me to some sort of James Last mood). The sound engineering is of the worst i have met for years. Loreenas voice is clippind frequently when it gets a little louder. The harp and other instruments a hardly been heard in some tracks thogh you can see them being played (remebers me to silent movie ages). The video qality is fluffy and lacks of blillinace at all. If you belong to those species who don't notice these all these things, you would be happy with that recording maybe. To me its a pitty that none of Loreenas music ever was engineered propperly through all those long long years. But this recording beats them all maybe."
5,Great music and video,"A friend from out of town showed the video and live performance of Loreena Mckinnet. I thoroughly enjoyed the video, Moorish scenery, weird instruments ( a hurdy gurdy?) used to make the music and the mesmerizing voice of McKinnet. I kept humming the tunes and decided to get a copy for my self after my friend returned home. One of the best purchases I have made this year."
5,Outstanding!,I ordered this DVD / CD combo from an Amazon reseller since it was the only source available at the time. Unfortunately I only received a single DVD with no CD's. Amazon customer service credited my account and sent me a prepaid return sticker so all is well. I watched the DVD and was amazed at the performance. The audio was excellent in Dolby Digital 5.1 but I noticed that the video was not quite as good as the audio. I think I will wait a bit and hope that a Blu Ray version is issued before I purchase a replacement.
5,fantastic,"I got this to show my daughter all of the instruments, after I stumbled across a few clips while surfing. This is a beautiful concert, and the audio is wonderfully mastered. Loreena is, of course, fabulous, but the other musicians are amazing as well."
5,Simply wonderful...,"The band is tight and Loreena's vocals are stable and recording-like; the lighting is mesmerizing and of course, if you are a fan of her music, this should be a real treat."
4,What is the deal with the cover art?!,"it looks like Disney cartoon workI love her work and the covers previous were very well designed and then now this 'cartoony' look is weirda small gripe but still..Loreenas site is selling all her CDs, now under the UMG/Verve Label, for $10!!!Which comes out to $7.45 USD at checkout with post added =$10 USD deliveredSupport her-im sure this deepening Recession/Depression (yes)is slowing sales at her siteNearly all discs are remastered (from 2006) and enhanced, but all of the bonus CD sets are goneI really wish she would release LM: LIVE IN SAN FRANCISCO AT THE PALACE OF FINE ARTSthe current disc is only samples of a fantastic concert which should be on DVD (16x9)widescreenor at least the full concert on a remastered disc-feel free to write in a request and pester her or her secretaryI was there and it was one of the most magical times ive had a a concert, ever"
5,Great stuff!,"Probably the best compendium of her work (and a great DVD too, as this gives the audience the chance to see Loreena's really outstanding musicians show off their 'stuff!'), this and 'Ancient Muse' are two of my favorite CD's!! More! More!!"
5,A must have for aspiring French cooks,This book is the real McCoy. If you really want to try your hand at French cooking then you'll want this book. It's definitely not a beginners book but it will help the experienced cook refine their skills. And the recipes won't insult your abilities like the barefoot bimbo's books do.
3,"Yet another in my ""I Bought It For Only One Song"" series","I became a KJ fan relatively late, back in the early 90s. I knew who they were, I remember when Follow the Leader was played on KROQ pretty regularly and Living In the 80s was on MTV often. But it wasn't until I heard Helmet do a cover of Primitive that I decided to really check them out. I bought tons of their albums, but the first two are my favorites by far. After buying so many of their records, I noticed something was missing. At some point on MTV's 120 Minutes I'd seen a video for a song called A New Day, and I really loved it. I had to have it, so I hunted it down until I found it on this CD. Now it's the only song on that CD that skips, so here I am buying a new copy! Yes, I'm a wasteful idiot."
4,What I wanted,"I bought two universal UK plug adapters, they arrived on time and work perfectly. One is a little difficult to get into the wall outlet, but it does eventually fit and works well."
5,good plug,"went to ireland where the elec. sockets are different from ours. it worked great and had a great price, you can use the same plug in other countries where the elec. is the same as ireland. so, if i go out of country again, i have the plug, the price was great too."
1,Doesn't work with us plugs,I can't plug any of my united states plugs into this adaptor .. Not sure if the plug works in the UK
1,Didn't work,"When I arrived in Singapore (same plug as UK), it didn't work. I went around the corner and bought a different adaptor that did for under $4 from one of Singapore's ubiquitous malls."
2,Should have read the other reviews first,"As others have said,this does not work with polarized plugs. This is a huge shortcoming that renders it practically useless"
4,Wing shop was a fun and exciting adventure!,"Dear. Amazon We liked the story Wing Shop because the boy had a sence of humor, different type of wings, colorfull wings, bat wings, the buter, And how the bee wing got the little boy homwThe author and publisher of Whing Shop as Elvira Woodruff and are publiser is Holiday Hose. We hope to actually meet Elvira Woodruff in our school in March. We have some questions for her when she visit. 1. What is your favorite book? 2. Why did she write Wing shop? 3.How did she get all thos wings in the wing shop 4. What was your favorite type of wing in the wing shop. 5.How did you get this job."
2,A lot of money for a very plain puppet,"Being a grandmother, I was sucker enough to purchase this for my grandson. Therefore, I swallowed hard and coughed up the bucks to purchase this puppet. Wow, what a let down. It is very plain and doesn't appear to be made all that well. I have a hard time understanding why the puppet costs so much, and this was the LEAST expensive one I could find."
2,dirty rock,"I normally dont do reviews for cds with a lot of reviews ,but i had to on this one.What was kory clarke thinking on this one ,is he the next steven perchy of ratt.I mean come on fellows just because you get misstreated from the record companines dont take it out on the fans , simply put this album is terrible."
3,"It's nice to hear Korey sing again, BUT....","I was excited to hear that Korey Clarke was singing in a new band since I loved his last two bands the SPACE AGE PLAYBOYS and WARRIOR SOUL, and I think Korey is one of Rock's greatest vocalists/front men. However, I was disappointed upon hearing this band DIRTY RIG... as someone else said, it seems Korey has joined a bar band. It's okay rock music I suppose, but nothing special--just generic, mediocre rock riffs that we've all heard a thousand times before played by musicians who aren't really that good. While Korey's vocals are great and all (still gritty and nasty sounding with an 80's buttrock vibe), the lyrics do suck for the most part. I mean, he sings about being drunk and living in a trailer park. Hmmm... okay. The song ""like a Star"" seems to be the one gem on this CD, but I think korey could have done a LOT better than this and I personally will NOT be buying this album unless it's listed for under a dollar."
3,OK... But Kory could do better,"Kory Clarke, in my opinion, is a great performer and songwriter. i was very surprised to see that he joined this band. But, i didnt think he would throw his abilities to the wind by joining a bar band! Dont get me wrong, this cd has a few rockin tracks that go great with a few beers, but definately not in the same league as Warrior Soul or even Space Age Playboys.If you are a WS fan or a fan of Kory Clarke's 'Opium Hotel' cd, dont bother with this. It is not deep on any level, and definately not political. But if you just want some rocking background music, this is ok.."
2,Not What It Appears,"There are some beautiful pictures and wonderful ideas in this book. However, it is not what it appears. It ""features"" the work of several designers, and purports to provide ""resources"" which are actually thinly disguised advertisements for the listed vendors. I would not have spent $34.95 for this book had I known what it really was. I have no theoretical objection to such a book, but I'd like to know what I'm getting before buying. This was a disappointment."
5,Outstanding in Every Way!,"Having read S. McCoy's negative comments, I have to respond with positives. Oddly, S. McCoy saw all the colors in the first chapter, ""Updated Colonial"" as purple when they were blue. I found that chapter particularly outstanding! The whole book is beautifully produced - wonderful writing and magnificent photography. The ""Resources"" sections and the ""Designer Tips"" will be extremely helpful to those decorating a house or apartment. Also, what makes the book so interesting is that there is a nice mix of apartments and houses and they are all suited to their various locales. For anyone decorating a home (and particularly those who have a new space that needs lots of charm), this book is a must!"
4,itll hit you like....a boomeraaaaaaaannnnnnnnnnggggggg,"this album wasnt all that great.but its good songs,were really good.Like Betrayed,Silver Spoons,the ever-classic Forever,Cadillac Dreams,Little Ceazar(the debu of Eric Carr's vocal stylings),and my favorite,Boomerang.Boomerang's guitar parts will blow you straight into hell.So overall,buy it for the goob stuff on it 'cause theres nothin like it."
4,I thought it was awesome...,"Although this album has taken a beating from some KISS fans, I really loved it. It has some really cool hooks in it and I loved the input that ERIC CARR had on the album, especially ""Little Caesar."" There are some obvious weak links on the album like ""read my body"" but I think that if people honestly listen to the album, they'll like it. My favs on the album: ""Forever,"" ""Little Caesar"" and the one I can't get enough of; ""Love me to Hate You!"" I love the hooks in that song! Bruce has some brilliant input! END"
5,Rock and Roll,"Rockin and a rollin head banging to da wall, this is groovy music man and i loves it.Gives me a head ache but this music makes me go wild.And it drives me wild and drives me crazy."
5,Round up the 80's with a bang,"This last KISS album of the 80s and with Eric Carr was a major success. Great songs from Gene Simmons like ""Cadillac Dreams"", ""Boomerang"". Eric Carr's first lead vocals song which kicks... called ""Little Ceasar"". Paul came out with another bang and terrific ballad called ""FOREVER"" that is one of my alltime favroite KISS songs. other great songs like ""SILVER SPOON"", ""Rise to It"", and ""Hide Your Heart."" This is a KISS album that is a must buy."
1,"""Rise To Ruins""..","..I was a HUGE Kiss fan before this album. As soon as I first heard ""Rise To It"", I knew this was it for Kiss and for me loving them. They were never the same again after this album. This album never fooled me for a moment. Generally one of the weakest assortment of songs I've ever heard by ANY band. Even ""Forever"", although a great song and video, couldn't salvage this train-wreck. Kiss had truly had their time. 'Crazy Nights' appeared to have some direction, purpose, some fine playing and a brilliant album cover. To top THIS pitiful album off, a dreadfully weak album cover. Contrived and pathetic. This album is terribly weak. An extremely poor effort. The end."
1,FAILS TO RISE TO IT,"Certainly you can sense that changes were a foot, but with a half baked production, Gene's material sinking even lower (if possible)and Paul straining his vocal chords over less than convincing copies of more popular acts ideas there is too little to redeem this one. Of course there is always one shining light in the depths of darkness this time a mega ballad called ""Forever"" which managed a good placing on the mainstream charts and allowed the band to hit the road (promotors were un-convinced that a tour could be supported until the single charted). ""Hide Your Heart"" has Bon Jovi written all over it spoilt by an over obvious chorus, ""Read My Body"" a sub-standard Def Leppard wannabe, and na na na's, ah ah ah's and woah woaha's punctuating any other song that lacked a lyric to finish it off properly. In my mind the darkest hour musically for the mighty Kiss. Add last to your collection. Even the cover sucks the big one."
1,worse than crazy nights if that's possible,I just cannot believe how terrible this is. Kiss really should have retired after Animalize anyhow. They have not done a decent album since. Gene and Paul should be outright ashamed of themselves. I guess they didn't learn that jumping on trends for them does not work after the Dynasty/Unmasked awfulness. How could they sink even lower? Start putting out crap like this was the answer.
4,Darren d.,I always like kiss back with there makeup in the 70`s. but in the late 80`s the makeup came off and the song`s was not as good.BUT HOT IN THE SHADE is a great cd .HIDE YOUR HEART AND SILVER SPOON is a blast!! for the money buy this cd!! IT`S GOOOOD.THANK YOU.
4,Eric's Last,"Fearing they where losing their hard rock followers,Kiss tried to toughen their pop sound on the release.Vini Ponica was at the mixing desk and all was right for a classic album.HOT IN THE SHADE shows a leaner,heavier Kiss that was not present in the days of ANIMALISE,ASYLUM,and CRAZY NIGHTS.Athough their are one of two duffers(READ MY BODY,PRISONER OF LOVE),the rest are Kiss Klassics,proving that the boys still retained a little of that seventies' magic.Eric provides vocals on his LITTLE CEASAR (co-written with Gene).Sadly,this was to become his last full album and tour with Kiss;many fans are still mourning the loss.This was the start of Kiss' rock redemption,which would be fully realised with REVENGE."
5,a great album,"I'm a huge Kiss fan, and in spite of what many people say, I think this is a really great album. There are some very good songs here. My favorite is ""King of Hearts."" Bruce Kulick (my hero) is a very talented guitar player and this album is where he started to demonstrate a lot of his own style. If you're open-minded, then you'll love this album. But if you're expecting ""Rock and Roll All Nite"" and ""Beth"" and songs like that you'll be sadly disappointed."
1,The tour ruled the album basically sucked!,"Hot in the Shade made Kiss""s plummet down in the late 80's look worse. Why do we have 15 tracks on the most (in my opinion) unfocused record. Gene is by far clueless ever. The only great tracks here are the singles especially the top 10 ""Forever"" a great tune I might say. The others are plain horrible or maybe mediocre at best. This does sadly end Eric Carr'S tenure with the band as he died 2 years later in 1991. His vocal for his one and only ""Little Caesar"" is average at best,but Eric will always be remembered forever R.I.P Kiss will come back in full force with 1992 Revenge Cd. This was the first time I saw Kiss the tour was amazing and it comes to show you that no matter who is in the band Kiss still rule live."
2,Not A Recommended Album,"I had this album for a while, but I eventually got rid of it. I've got a few Kiss albums on tape and CD, but Hot in the Shade is the only one I had no good reason to keep. The songs just never left an impression on me and just seemed to be filler with nothing standing out. Not a completely poor album, but not recommended either."
1,A mere shadow of Creatures of the Night,"This album has absolutely no original songs in it. Kiss hit its low point with this album and the previous album. Ace Frehley plays ""Hide Your Heart"" more like Kiss than Kiss does. Another low point in this band's existance."
3,R.I.P.Eric Carr,"This last album with Eric Carr has little to offer other than the Michael Bolton co wriotten power ballad Forever. Diehards may find other worthwhile tracks, but Forever is the show stopper. KISS' 80s drummer Eric Carr fell victim to cancer."
3,"Hey man, where's the quality???","It was one of the most favourite albums when I firstly heard KISS catalogue on mp3. And I dreamt about getting it with better quality, than that. And what have I now??? A little bit better clearance of sound and no more!!! You may rise volume higher but you won't get what you want. It's not remastered version. But nostalgie of student era is so strong (I was 19 and KISS symbolized that period of my life), so I have what I have."
4,Still Hot After All This Time,This album will get you moving. It is reallt energetic and make you feel like celebrating. Hide your heart is a great story type song. Great message. Forever is right up there with Beth as a ballad. Hot in the Shade is an overall good album with bettter hooks.
1,"KISS, bought the Disc, not a good KISS album","This is pretty close to being a KISS low point.I Bought the Disc because it is KISS ( Mindless fan that I am), but the material just was not up to the 70's standard . If you like the original KISS material, this is not one to buy, however, it is probably one to get if you need a complete collection, but do not expect a KISS album. Hard to see this as rock... and it certainly is not a good hair band album.Blech"
3,Inconsistent,"""Hot In The Shade"" is actually an album of demo tracks that were deemed good enough/polished up enough to comprise an album. The result is mixed: there are some very good songs, along with some songs I could really do without. The songs I like, I tend to like a lot; the songs I dislike, I REALLY dislike! This is an uneven album of 15 songs, which could have been a very good album of 10 or 11 songs had they just left off some of the less stellar tracks.Is it worth picking up? Yes. But if you're new to KISS, I'd recommend something like ""Love Gun"" instead, or ""Double Platinum"" as a good best-of type album."
2,not one of there better works,"Probably there worst piece of work. I do not reccommend it, especially for those who are used to getting a good product from KISS. This is coming from a big fan."
1,Hot In the Shade Is Freezing Cold!,This without a doubt has to be one of the worst albums Kiss ever released.15 songs and hardly a good one in the bunch!The song Rise to It can get very annoying unless your in a super party mood and the rest of the songs don't even really rate a mention.Hide Your Heart was actually done better by Ace Frehley on his Trouble Walkin album.If Ace can upstage Paul on his own song what does that say about this album?Not to mention if Paul has to co-write with Michael Bolton (Forever) than you know the Kiss of the make up days was totally scrapped beyond recognition~!
1,terrible,"KISS at their worst, not a good song here, avoid, what a shame this is Eric Carr's farewell, he deserved better"
2,Good Fiction/Poor History,"As a fan of mysteries and especially the Villisca axe murder story, Morning Ran Red is an interesting work of fiction. It is loosely based on an actual Southwest Iowa crime and the events' characters. As someone who has researched the Villisca case thoroughly, you will not find any semblence of accurate history in its pages. It will hold your attention to the end. But for those who say it is accurate in its details, they are not well-versed in the actual Villisca story."
4,The Morning Ran Red,"The Morning Ran Red sat on my shelf unread for many months. It was a gift to me and one I thought probably wouldn't be to my liking. I was very pleasantly surprised, when I started the book I couldn't put it down. I will recommend it to my book-club. Thank you Mr. Bowman, keep writing more mysteries."
3,Morning Ran Red - Kindle,This was an interesting version of what may have happened during and after the Villisca murders. The only problem I had with the book was that the Kindle version was not well edited.
2,Meh.,"This was a disappointment. I was expecting a book about the history of the murders and possibly an analysis of the investigation and theories about the killer(s). Instead, it is a potboiler of sex and melodrama. It should have made clear that this book was a highly fictionalized story."
5,Very entertaining fictionalization of the Villisca axe murders,"This book was a real page turner - I could hardly put it down some nights. The author has taken the Villisca axe murders of 1912 and recast them. It was a great and well-told story, and made me feel as though I was back in 1912 Villisca, knowing however that this was not the ""true"" story necessarily. Combined with my other readings on the murders, this more than any other helped me set the stage mentally for the documents I've read about the actual events."
5,Bocephus,"To me this was Hank Williams Jr's best album. Not a bad song on it. He does an incredible acoustic version of the Allman Brothers ""Come and Go Blues"". I originally bought this when it was released in 1980 on vinyl."
4,Very Cute!!!!!!!!! Great Price,Great pair of sunglasses but runs a little large. The case is very stirdy and well constructed. The glasses are pretty light weight but the overall size is kinda large for wide face. Hope this Helps!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,Wasn't There a Thrilla in Manila,"David Remnick's King of the World barely skims the surface of the spectacular life of Muhammad Ali. The only fights that Remnick discusses is two of the battles with Sonny Liston. What about Fraizer? What about Foreman? Heck, what about Spinks? Wasn't there a Rumble in the Jungle? And I know there was a Thrillia in Manila. Didn't Ali get knocked silly in MSG thanks to the soup bone of Joe Fraizer? The first part of this book isn't even about Ali. When are we going to get the full, uncut story of Ali?"
4,The author brilliantly shows why Ali was King of the World,"Remnick employs an exceptional writing style in describing the ascendency of Clay/Ali against the backdrop of the Patterson-Liston matches. His treatments of the preparations for the Ali-Liston fights are tantalizing. I would have enjoyed some discussion of Ali's post-prison matches, viz., Frazier and Foreman but that shortcoming does not change the fact that this was my favorite book of 1998"
5,Muhammad - Boxing Against Society,"In one on the Eyes on the Prize videos, the focus is on Muhammad Ali and his effect on American culture. Well, this book addresses those issues and more. The most phenomenal fact about Ali is that he vastly shaped himself. When boxing promoters largely developed the public personas of their fighters, Ali decided who he would be and didn't care about how he would be viewed. He cared more about his principles. If Liston and Patterson had done the same, they would probably have been happier men.Whether you hate Ali or love him, read this book to better understand him."
5,"He Still ""Floats Like A Butterfly, Stings Like A Bee""","David Remnick is superb. This is the ""Real Book"" David should win the Pulitzer Prizer for, not ""that other one"", he did win one for writing. As Ali's Deer Lake, Pa. Training Camp photographer during the '70's, I can tell you of this kind, gentle man, who was oh so awesome within the ring. Ali is a ""one-man masterpiece"", ""a true work of functional artisitic prowess"". David Remnick, on paper in prose, captures all of this. Ali is my friend, my mentor, my role model, and yes, I AM a bit biased, but there have been other works on Ali and this is the ""best of the best"". May Allah be with you, David, and with you, ""Champ"". - Maury Schiowitz"
5,Superb read,I think I read this in 3 or 4 sittings - that's unheard of for me.I was literally swept along in the narrative - and was most disappointed when the book ended!Simply the best sportsbook I've read in a long time.Highly recommended.
5,Top of the world,When I was growing up in Apartheid South Africa I remember listening on radio (pre-TV days) to the fight in Zaire. Ali was a symbol of a different world... I read this book with relish and couldn't put it down. I've been recommending it to everyone since then.
5,Thanks from the young crowd!!,"The cover caught my eye! I got the book for my father who, for as long as I can remember has been an Ali fan. Once I started reading I couldn't put it down. There is so much more to the man than just the talking. Although I'm too young to have seen the beginining. By reading this book I felt like I was there."
5,Ali is crazy good,"King of the World by David Remnick was one of the best books I've ever read. It is the true story of a champion and how he got there. I recommend anyone who likes stories about winning and glory, to read this book. If you also like reading about dudes getting smoked by a champ. Read this book."
5,The Greatest,"David Remnick's King of the World conveys the complexity of the man Muhammad Ali, both outspoken and tender, as it traces his early years as a young aspiring boxer and the events surrounding his first heavyweight championship. The book provides an inside look at the boxing establishment in the 1950s and 1960s and how it exploited and used young African American boxers, among them Liston and Patterson. Ali is unique among the boxers of that era, sustained by a strong sense of self and purpose. I was particularly intrigued by the description of Ali's religious journey and by the inner peace that characterizes him today. This book portrays a slice of American life, exposing the beauty of one human being, the drama of his life, and the racism that could have destroyed him but did not. Read this book and enjoy it!"
3,About the king and his kingdom,"This bestselling biography of Muhammad Ali is an excellently written page-turner which not only captures Ali's rise to greatness, but also the political undercurrents of the era."
2,scraping something,"um, not so much. there's no real music to be found here. lots of pieces of music, lots of bad (really bad) solo stuff from the guys that sounds like the worst of cheesed out eighties rock and some sound files. oh, there's two pretty good concerts (kinda--one of them is actually the rehearsal before a concert so no audience) on the data disc, but that hardly justifies the sixty to eighty dollars you're going to spend. the booklet isn't even that good. i love gentle giant, they're one of my favorites of the prog scene, but i'm going to be selling this soon."
1,Waste of time and money,"It's a textbook, which means that the price is inflated atrociously high. This text is meant for introductory courses and for that purpose it is tolerable. Nevertheless, it is long-winded, dull and poorly written. Also, because it is meant to be used for an introductory overview course, most of the material will most likely be used during lectures. The truth is, this book was the ""required reading"" for a course I took. Our Professor was most likely required to assign a textbook and she picked this one, and never assigned us to read any of it. I read parts before exams in order to try to fill in any gaps from our lectures, but this book is a waste of time and money if not necessary for carrying out assignments."
1,the driest book ever......,"I have been assigned this book for a class in my Master's program in performance. This is quite possibly the driest book I've ever had the pain of reading. I will admit, there is a LOT of information here, but it is presented in the most boring way possible. I'd rather read an outline. I have NEVER sold back a textbook in my entire academic career, but this one will be going back, if I dont burn it.If you are a professor, please, have mercy. Dont assign this book. I've had to read 400 pages of it and I already want to tear out my eyes."
4,Sweaty enough for the dough,"They're sweat pants. They have pockets, which is nice. They're fairly long, which is also nice. No elastic around the ankles which is great. Also, they're soft. So they've got that going for them. The fabric appears to be of decent quality. All in all a decent product. I mean, they're sweat pants, you know?"
3,NICE BUT NOT MUCH COTTON CONTENT,"Nice pants but if you are looking, as I was, for less synthetic and more cotton (for hygiene reasons) then PLEASE NOTE: These are NOT 80/20 as described. They are 56/44. I found that out too late because the content tag is clear down the leg. If this is not a concern, these are nice. Good and long and warm."
4,short people,Very nice pants. Very comfortable but be ready to have some one hem them to length for you.
3,Misleading,"The sweatpants are very comfortable and I wear them all the time, but the advertising is misleading. They are only 50% fleece, and 50% cotton. This wouldn't be a problem except for that they are not all fleece, and since I bought them for camping and needed things without cotton (because cotton takes forever to dry) I had to borrow a friend's stuff that was too small. Still, the pants are very nice and now that I am back home I wear them all the time."
1,Do not buy these! They are terrible. Save your money for other pants.,"I can't overstate how poorly these sweat pants fit. For reference, I ordered the Medium size.The crotch on these pants hangs just above the knees, and the pant legs are about 6 inches too long. I have no idea who on earth these were designed to fit. Before I purchased these I was very close to buying a different pair of pants, but I changed my mind because these were much cheaper. I wish I had followed my original intuition.The only redeeming quality of these pants is that they are cheap. But this truly is a case where you get what you pay for.These pants are not worth buying at any price. Skip them."
4,"Good fit, size was accurate.",Got exactly what I expected. Size was good and quality seems pretty good. Had a very difficult time finding this type of product in stores. Thanks.
2,Odd design - sizes are off.,The pocket design on these pants is weird which you can already tell a little bit by the picture. The insides of the pocket are white and because of the way it's cut they are always exposed which makes it look very odd. Other than that the sizes are off - the small is a medium at best. I would just go to your local store instead since I tried to find similar products on the website but they are way too expensive.
4,"Fantastic sweats, good price","The fit is a little off, but it's ridiculous what some sweatpants cost these days. The fabric feels great straight out of the package, and should get better with many washings. I like them, and will probably buy more."
1,Uncomfortable fit,"Needed new open-bottom heavyweight sweatpants...live in them after work and on weekends in winter...always ordered from Penneys but theyquit making the nice heavy ones purchased for past 20 yrs...anyway, have had nice heavy Champion sweatshirts in the past so ordered these...ordered usual XL size..the pair received were labeled XL but were very tight and pulled down off backside when sitting or bending over...thought maybe they were sized for women...no rise area whatsoever...anyway, returned them and received prompt refund...still looking for 9 oz or more heavyweight open bottom sweatpants...cannot find any at big box stores...all their material is thin & flimsy..."
4,meet expectation,I bought this pant for my Dad. It's good quality. The only down side is it's white pocket.
3,Ok product - good for the price,"The sweats are OK but they are rather low quality, thin and tight around the ankles. I am satisfied but would not buy them again. Disclaimer- I am very picky and like the high quailty abercrombie type sweat pants."
4,Nice Sweatpants,"I am about 5'11"" and have a 33 inch waist. I bought medium and they fit very well. I like the lack of elastic on the bottom and the pockets. They are nice sweatpants for the money. The opening on the bottom isn't large enough to go over my shoes well, I would prefer they did. I also bought the Soffe Men's Classic, they have a larger opening on the bottom. If I buy anymore I will go with the Soffe."
3,Decent Value for the Money,"Decent value for the money, although I have better quality. These are a bit short on the crotch to waist length. As a result, bending over or crouching produces a bit of over exposure from the rear."
5,Finally sweats that are long enough!,"My son is 6'5"" 190 lbs. and I can never find sweats or lounge pants that are long enough. I have found a couple in tall sizes that seemed long enough until I laundered them and they shrunk 1-2 inches. Not so with these quality sweats! They are plenty long and they didn't shrink much (if any) at all. Based on the other reviews, I ordered a medium (his usual size) and a large. The medium was too small but Amazon was great with free return shipping. Yes, they are made very long in the crotch as well, but he's only 16 and that's how kids wear their pants these days (low on the waist with a saggy crotch). Besides, who really cares just for a comfortable, casual sweatpant? I couldn't be happier with this purchase!"
4,Nice Sweatpants,"for $13, this is one of the best sweatpants i ever wear, true to size ( im 28 at waist, order a small and fit perfectly. ) just a little to long and saggy.i live in MN, the winter here is pretty cold, this sweatpants work really well ( 10F ).4 stars because of white pocket and a little too long."
2,Not very happy with these,"The fit is good and they are comfortable, but mine (dark grey) suffered pretty bad piling on the crotch after the first wearing/washing (line dried). Not super happy about that. Perhaps I should have washed them inside out? I'm not convinced these are going to last many washings."
3,Bad drawstring?,"First of all, the guy who said he's a 33 and that the medium didn't fit is in denial. I am also a 32-34 (depending on brand) and the large size is WAY too large in both waist and length.Second, the draw string got destroyed by my dryer in the first wash. My dryer is crap but this is the only thing it's ever done that to."
4,"Very soft and comfortable, but a too long","Overall these are great sweatpants, a lot higher quality than the $5 ones you'll find at a wal-mart. The medium pants are a great fit for me (I wear a 31 or 32 in jeans), but the legs are an inch or maybe two too long (I'm 6'0"" tall and usually wear 30-32 length pant legs). Very comfortable, could wear around the house all day, but I don't think these would be the best choice to jog in below freezing temps as they aren't the absolute warmest and the length could definitely trip you up running unless you are very tall."
5,Exactly what I was looking for,I was looking for comfortable sweatpants and that is exactly what I got. They are perfect for exercise or just lounging around my apartment. I would definitely recommend them to anyone.
4,comfy but long,"very soft and comfortable pants but they are a bit long, as the others have already said. I am 6'2"" and got a medium and they are still big. Other than that they are great."
4,"LOVE IT! Great for women, too!","I'm kinda tall for a girl (5'9ish) and usually when I buy sweatpants in women's sizes, they're barely long enough to graze the floor but after I wash and dry them, they shrink up to my ankles. Call me weird, but I can't stand that -- I have to have my lounge pants long! So, I bought these and I absolutely LOVE them! They're comfy, don't shrink up, and they keep me warm without burning me up. They are long in the waist since they're guys, but it's not too bad. A lot of girls wear guys lounge pants, so it's really no big deal for them to be baggy in that area, ha!Overall, these are a great pair of sweatpants -- perfect for guys AND girls!"
4,Rascals in Paradise,"Michener's compilation of short stories arrayed around the dreamer in all of us who lust over south seas lore, whether we have lived there or perhaps never even visited. These are stories rich in visual majesty, and the human ambition, drive, and misadventure, which the lucky few of us have actually lived."
3,Rascals in Paradise,quick delivery - received as shown without dust coverand way too musky - can hardly read with my asthma-sorry to say but true.cheap so it is also true that u get what u pay for.
3,Does not work on older VGA system,"I'm giving 3 stars, as I have to give stars to review. However I never got it to work, so perhaps it is actually a good card. Just not for upgrading older systems (which is however one of its target audiences).I have a 4 year old ASUS PCI-Express v1 motherboard in which my old ASUS X1600 XTX PCI-Express graphics card started to fail. So I decided to replace it with this card. Price was good and the reviews state that power-usage is issue for older boards. I have no HDMI/DVI monitors, but since there is a DVI-I (and not just DVI-D) connector and at least a old analog VGA I assumed I'd be safe.Unfortunately it doesn't work with CRT screens. The system simply won't boot with a CRT monitor. Not when connected to the VGA and not when using a DVI-I to Sub connector.That is, it is either that or it doesn't work in a PCI-E v1 board, which is equally bad, as PCI-E v2.1 cards should be backwards compatible.So people who look for cards to upgrade older system, be warned."
3,"Ahh, this old gun","Okay, I was bored so I decided to give my review about this gun:Cons:-I ejected the magazine and it fell onto the cement, it broke pretty easily.-I had it on my bed and my dog jumped on, it fell and the barrel broke off, luckily, you can either use the mock silencer or the regular barrel.-It really doesn't have much range, or much firepower. Just a backyard gun, or something for fun, not a good idea to use against a Marui or other pro-level airsoft riflesPros:-Fair rate of fire-Good way to kill time xD-Accurate at 'till about 30 feet.Overall, it's just a backyard gun that should really only be used for fun.TIP: Never leave unattended with a dog, or at least, my dog.. He tends to chew things.."
1,this gun sucks,"i got this gun thinkin i could go in the backyard and just shoot things like crazy but when i got it, with in 10 min the magazeen broke the saftey broke and the stock fell off and i didnt even drop it I'v never have had a gun this bad befor and i cant even get my cash back"
3,It's pretty neat.,"The gun is ok overall, nothing special. Neither the flashlight or laser worked when I got it and the assembly instructions were poorly written."
3,It works but with limitation,It works fine but the call button is not noticeable. Also it not have any pilot light to indicete that is working. I have to install a LED close to the button.
5,Oh Billie!,"The first time I could recall hearing a Billie Holiday song was when I watched the movie ""Forever Young"" a while back. When they're listening in the car to ""The Very Thought of You"", I ask, ""Dad, who is that singing?"" He said, ""I think it's Billie Holiday."" I thought, AND YOU NEVER SHOWED ME BILLIE HOLIDAY?! I was hooked right when she sang the first notes. Her voice was be-a-utifull! So I searched for her. Since then, about a couple of years ago, it seems as if many people I come across listen to Billie. Anyway, I think this was a wonderful collection of Billie's that Billy was so kind to put together. Thank you. Billie's voice is just gorgeous."
3,"Not Bad In Itself, But Come on Rhino, We Want More","It is certainly a good collection, but in a way short of some rock'n'rollers that should have been on the tape. The tape begins with The Righteous Brother's ""Ko Ko Joe"" but it is unaccountably very short (though different take from that of The Righteous Brothers Volume in Shindig series). The overall feeling is that mastertapes recording the whole shows are badly edited to fill in the tape, so, though the performance itself is wonderful, sometimes I wish I could see one ENTIRE show from the beginning to the end.Having said that, the tape had its great moment, one of which is Tina Turner's exciting performance. Watch how she almost forgets the place to stop singing, because she herself gets excited while singing!"
3,Less than I hoped for,"While not a badly written book, it somehow completely failed to deliver on it's title as far as I was concerned. The book is primarily stories about the specific practices of named companies but for whatever reason I found little in it that was useful in terms of extending it to the real world. Definitely not the content I was looking for."
2,wrong size,"nice quality filter. However, it was the wrong size for a 2004 Lexus RX330 even though the part number was correct. Ordered 2 and they were both too large. Reordered another brand and they were the correct size and wortked great."
3,Rating a product based on its package (for Lexus RX300),"I have not gotten the chance to ""enjoy"" cleaner air that the Bosch Premium Cabin Filter P3755 has to offer, so my feedback and rating will be based on the ease and nature of installation of the filter into the RX300.The following post shows you how to replace the cabin filter:[...]After removing the old filter, I found that the Bosch model does not fit into the existing plastic frame well. It is not boxed with any reinforcements (typically thick paper), so after fitting the Bosch filter into the frame, there was a gap on the 2 sides of the filter that I needed to glue or tape to the frame. I chose to tape it using thin Duck tape. So I am not convinced that this model is built for RX300. Next time, I will look elsewhere."
3,Cabin filter,"The filter is little smaller than it should be. We have stretched the filter a little to fit in the area; otherwise, everything is good."
3,Bosch Cabin Filter,The filter is satisfactory except it was larger than the frame it suppose to fit into. I had to modify the size to make it fit. I'll think twice before ordering it again. The filter portion was satisfactory for the job it's suppose to do.
4,Spacesex - a review from a Claude Challe convert,"Wow is all I can say! A great mix of music which gets your juices flowing (no pun intended!). Claude really gets the mood going & once you view the enclosed booklet which contains pictures of the rooms at the hotel on which the CD is based, you'll understand why the music has that soooo sensual feel packed with imagery. A great CD to listen to whilst laying back with your favourite person..make sure you have some candles & red wine handy as this music is bound to make some magic happen!"
5,READ NOW!,"this was a great book, i really liked all of the adventers. this book was just as grat as the rest of the series, it is a must-buy!!!!!"
1,Disgusting Customer Service,"Ordered two bottles and only received one, the supplier refused to resend the bottle and only refunded the cost of the bottle but kept 25 postage, the customer service woman insinuated that I was lying, I would NOT recommend anyone use this company as you will lose your money."
4,Pretty Good Smelly,"This stuff smells pretty good. I don't know how to really review a cologne, you should prolly just smell it for yourself."
1,Rubbing Alcohol,"I bought this product from Amazon as the seller, and I received a bottle of some substance with ABSOLUTELY NO aroma. If I wanted rubbing alcohol, I would have gone to CVS. There wasn't even a hint of the original cologne; whoever stole it didn't even go through the effort of cutting the cologne."
2,Wrong John Varvatos,"I bought this cologne with the vintage and they sent me two of the vintage, so i'm not sure if this is a good cologne."
3,Tested it at Macy's,"I had a lady from the fragrance counter at Macy's spray some on one of those thin pieces of papers they give you.It was a pretty good smell but smelt too common. Sort of similar to bvlgari blv and hugo boss dark blue.And the scent only lasted strong on the piece of paper for about an hour.So I'd say this about it. If Macy's put it on clearance for about 20 dollars I'd buy it. As long as the shrink wrap wasn't or bottle wasn't damaged. I will not purchase from amazon. I'm seeing too many reviews about it being fake,average, and or not lasting long time."
2,It may be fake,This John Varvatos has only remnants of the smell of the one they sell at department stores. A watered down version. Has a strong ethanol scent for its top notes. Base notes resemble JV but only lasts for a couple of hours. This may be fake. I should've spent an extra $20 and bought at Sephora.
5,Cork sniffers unite,"Sniff,sniff. I've gotten more compliments from this cologne than all the others combined. Play it down, though, or else the price will go through the roof for all of us!"
5,John Varvatos by Jon Varbatos,I bought this for my husband since he mentioned he used to wear this cologne once upon a time. I LOOOOVE the way this smells.
1,Not the same as previous sample bottle,"This was the second sample bottle that I purchased.I was very satisfied with the first bottle, liked the fragrance, and was thinking about buying a larger size.Second bottle arrived and smelled ""bad"" did not smell at all like the first sample. Even tried side by side test (one on the back of each hand) My wife said that they were totally different with the second bottle having a bad odor (not a good fragrance)Can this stuff go bad in the bottle?"
1,Not what I ordered,I ordered John Varvatos classic The bottle I received didn't have the words classic on the Varvatos name and the cologne seems different. It's a bunch of BS. and I'm sure it's a nightmare of arguing trying to figure this out or get it replaced with the correct one even if they sell the one I wanted. In short I'm not buying cologne every again from amazon
3,Mediocre,"Well,Fine with no box, no cap and stuff...I've Googled for top 10 and John Varvatos came up on top 1, so the purchase.I just don't see (smell) anything special about it.I've been complemented with old school polo sports (one in the blue bottle).Was looking for a better one.Just don't see anything special about this cologne, will try some other brand when this runs out..."
3,The John Varvatos Review,"Reading all of these reviews made me excited about ordering this product, and when i got , i tried it and the smell is not the impressive. I would expect more from this cologne to be rated so high. But i can't say it smells bad, it a average i would say"
3,"Truly great within 2-3 hours, than poof.","A very nice scent, for me; nicely balanced, smooth and nonsynthetic.A real pleaser when it is working for me. Very nice.I would truly love it if it held up closer to what I get from several otherproducts at this price point (>5 hours with decent taper off projection).It is too problematic for me to start off with an extra heavy application orneed to reinforce it every 2-3 hours or so, which seems to be the case here.It also has a very heavy burn rate, given it's poor longevity.Side by side it just expires way too quickly and it wasn't a fake either(unless fakes have penetrated top shelf department stores/not likely).Sadly I needed to move on as I just couldn't get comfortable with carryingaround a mini atomizer or sample bottle, nor did I want to go without. A ladymight carry their mobile supply where I just can't be that dependant and prissy.It will fade fast for you too, bet on it. If thats OK I'd say go for it."
5,Good scent,"Has great high and rich notes that change over time, definitely beats any kind of Axe spray"
3,Eclectic Metal,"Well, HoM have their own sound, I'll give them that. Going for a heavy folk influence with overwrought drumming (always a turn-off for me), mixed male/female vocals, lots of accoustic sections, etc. It's not bad, but to me it sounds too 'random', as though the band started playign and just wandered off through the wilderness. If you want straight-out power metal this is not the album for you."
2,For the novice only; not much to go on,"I wasn't thrilled with this book; the diagrams are downright lousy...They are not photographs but rather cartoons and only 2 or 3 chord fingerings are showed in the entire book. Basically, this book just does not have enough information and material....Personally, I feel Guitar for Dummies was the best beginners instruction manual I have found."
1,garbage,"This book is a big hoax. First, let's talk about themisleading title: ""How to Play the Guitar"" actuallymeans how to STRUM the guitar. That's all this would-beauthor tries to teach. Halfway through the book he tells youit's not meant to teach how to play melodies.Even so, he fails inteaching you how to accompany someone(or yourself singing).And mind you, all you'll ever learn here is to accompany someone to ""Skip to my Lou"" and all those boring, idiotic traditionalsongs. And only a couple of bars is introduced, not the whole song. In short, stay away from thias garbage. Don't waste yourtime or money. I've wasted my money but I'm certainly not goingto waste my time."
4,Great Sterling Silver Pen,"Upon arrival, I was impressed with the quality of this pen. I had read the reviews before I purchased this pen and based on what was written, I had to take the plunge. The only qualm I have is when the pen arrived, the metal clip was slightly scratched (hence the four stars). I do not feel this is a major setback as it will be a matter of time before I add my own scratches.I had also read how certain individuals are disturbed that Cross pens are made/assembled in China. This however, does not bother me. Cross has an excellent warranty on all pens so this wasn't much of a concern. The other issue was the marks on the pen not lining up which is correct. This again is not really to much trouble as the lines are barely visable unless you are looking closely. I would imagine if this pen was indeed made in the USA, the cost would be much higher. Anyhow, great product."
5,Exquisite,"This pen is brilliant. I want a pen for office use that had class and beauty and made of silver, so I went to site to site looking for a high quality pen with a reasonable price and finally came to this site and I was amazed of the craftmanship and the price, so I was skeptical, but I took a chance and when it came I open the package and it was more beautiful than I could a imagine so yes I recommend this product it has class and beauty and you won't regret."
2,Not what I was looking for,"I own a cross pen made in usa. The pen is heavy, very well made and gorgeous. I just recieved this pen thinking the reviews were just being over dramatic however, the pen really does feel like cheap tin. I have requested a refund immediately. For 75 $ the pen should be flawless and it just isnt."
1,tarnished hundred dollar pens embarrassed,"Bought 4 cross sterling silver pens as gifts. $75 or so each. Did not think I had to inspect them, beyond looking quickly in the box. Gave them as gifts, and all of them exhibited tarnish at top and or bottom. To late to return. First really bad experience with amazon. Should have bought crome for $20 each."
1,Black spots and yellow body,"Not what I expected at all from a Cross pen. It arrived as if it had been burned, perhaps rust, I am not sure. Black spots all over and body is a little yellow. I am returning it for a new one. I hope it comes alright this time. Very dissapointing!"
2,Not as other reviews stated!,"I bought this after reading the other 4 reviews that gave this pen 5 stars!The build quality is so china like, the upper and lower peaces of the pen are not aligned like it should .. you can never expect such horrible problem with such a highly priced product..Other than that it writes smoothly and came with a nice gift box.."
5,PRIMETIME AND THE FALLEN ANGEL,This set is really cool and even better that it comes with a ladder. This set has The Fallen Angel Christopher Daniels And Primetime Elix Skipper two of TNA'S best. Who will ever forget when Primetime walked the top of the Six Sides of Steel. I cant wait for the Six Sides of Steel ring so i can walk the top with the Primetime action figure. It's coming out in July I think. I just love everything about the TNA action figures.
5,HP82240B,How this priner comunicated whith analyzer NG AED Afriso. but not infrared only cable if it possible?????
3,don't twist the hands,"The toy is great after you Glue the hands in place. The moment I opened 1 package, I checked poseability, the hands were in an upside down direction, when I adjusted them they both twisted off very easy. I tried again with purchaseing another one. This time being very careful, and again the same thing happened. So I glued both sets in place, now there good to go.I do wish that the toy would have had Jonny Depp's cool creapy smile, just like the movie, Oh! well."
1,We have been waiting 5 Weeks for this product...,...we ordered this product on 8/14 and every week we get a revised ship status of one week. When will Amazon ever ship Willy?
4,great fashion finder,i think this book is great because it teaches you which clothes and accesories look best on you. but i think the price is a little high[ i got it for $.50!]
1,What's wrong with you?,"I read this book first. After that I made an appointment and met Dr. Attila Toth in person. He is an over-rated, highly over-priced Manhattan doctor who said nothing new about connection between infections and fertility. What is all hype about? Haven't you ever heard that chlamydia can cause infertility? His ""innovative"" theory about horizontal and vertical transmittance of infection is extremely dubious and not scientifically confirmed.But yes, he knows how to make good money on people's fertility problems by using his fame. Everything that has been successfully treated for years in Europe presented by arrogant, self-obsessed doctor Atilla Toth as a great ""revelation"" for which he feels legitimate to charge about 20K from a couple.What's wrong with you, guys? Explore better the opportunities around you. I am pretty sure you'll find less mercantile, much nicer doctor without all this bourgeois arrogance and bloated fame.Highly disappointed."
3,"Good story, but a little hard to read","I have always been a Han Solo fan, and it was good to find him getting over his self-pity and back to his usual form. However, I found the writing style of the book a little disappointing. The author seemed preoccupied with substituting overly-large words in the place of more simple terms. Anyone younger than graduate school will probably need a dictionary to get through it. Although I liked the story, the word choices really detracted from its appeal. Timothy Zahn and Kevin Anderson remain the champs when it comes to quality of Star Wars books."
1,Please go back to tarzan,"I have read about 2/3 of the Star Wars books and this is the worst I've ever read. The whole plot is boring. This is the first James Luceno book that I've read, and I'm not very encouraged to read any more. Han Solo was a decent character, until Luceno wrote about him. Obviously not one of my favorites."
3,"Slow Beginning, very slow :(","It was a slow beginning, reading this book. The first couple chapters, nothing important seemed to happen and hello, where was the action? There simply wasn't anything, until you start to read the beginning of the climax, which wasn't too bad. But the beginning was too slow for me. It reminded me of reading Vector Prime regarding the Vong's invasion - nothing but detail, detail and more detail without action."
5,So Han comes out of his shell. . .,"Han has finnaly emerged form his shell in this breathtaking novel. With all the grace of the original movies, James Luceno twists words to make us see what he writes. He gives us a heartbreaking portrayel of Chewie's memorial service and takes Han on a mission of revenge and rage. Han suffers more losses, an discovers a plot to take down the Jedi. Thsi book deals mostly with Han, but the others make their apperances too. Needless to say, I loved this book, and i suggest it to any one with a sense of justice and love and an imagination."
4,What I was waiting for... sort of,"For those of you looking for more of Han, look no further, for James Luceno has him brilliantly portrayed in this excellent novel. It seems that he is finally coming to grips with the loss of Chewbacca. And one of my old favorites, Tenel Ka, is at least *mentioned* which is far more than I can say for her in the *other* NJO series. However...Where were Anakin, Jacen, and Jaina, not to mention Danni Quee? Same question for Corran, Wedge, Gavin, some more rogues, Janson, Tycho... call me retro, but I love those guys! Lowie and Waroo (wasn't he called 'Lumpy' in earlier books or was that my imagination?) don't really have significant parts either, although I can hardly begrudge James Luceno for that- if I had it my way the book would be a thousand pages long (that way I probably wouldn't be done before the next book comes out- on second thought, I'd have it done in a week, maximum). All in all, a brilliant piece of science fiction. Yay James Luceno!"
4,Best NJO book - 4.5 stars,"In a series that I, a devoted Star Wars fan haven't liked much so far, Hero's Trial was a welcome addition. From the beginning, Luceno captures the spirit of the characters very well, and keeps the intrigue up without having to include mindless action. I love his portrayal of Han; I think that his is the best representation of Han that has ever been done, with the possible exception of A.C. Crispin's work in her Han Solo Trilogy. The introduction of Roa is interesting, although his recitation of classic Star Wars lines is cheesy, repetitive, and downright stupid. Other than that, however, this is an excellent book in what, so far, has been a lackluster series."
3,Could be a lot better,"I am not saying this book sucks, as a matter of fact it is a lot better than other SW books out there. The only problem is that the author doesn't stand to the quality of others like Zahn, Allston or Stackpole. He tries to give some edge to the book by introducing characters found in earlier books, but that goes in detriment of new characters and the story as a whole. Also, the book starts to get really exciting only after half of it is gone. Besides that it is quite a good book."
2,ZZZZZZZ - a real sleeper,"Forget Nodoze man... just read this!! This is James Luceno's first star wars book, and I have to give him a little slack just because he is new. However... He failed to capture the tone, and the general overall feel of the series that the other authors had created. Although discriptive with his words, he doesn't use them to capture a scene... he just uses them to be discriptive. Text books do the same thing. Although he did try to do some funky stuffs wuth his approach... like writing from Threepio's view at Chewie's funeral... he just doesn't pull it off. He doesn't advance the plot, or add to the charector at all; (this entire book is about Han.) And I don't know Han any better now than I did before. 350+ pages of total waste.An A for effort. A failing grade overall."
3,Anti-climatic .. drops plot for character,"I've been reading each NJO book in succession and have found that this book is the most boring. Reading a Star Wars book I root for the bad guy .. since the good guys always win anyways. And this book dissappoints me. The Vong achieve almost nothing - it seems nothing happens that affects the war. You could almost skip this book in that sense.Instead you get to read how Han accidentally, through lots of luck and coincedence, saves the day. It's just not gripping enough. I wished Elan fared better, she was a very interesting character.Where did Deign Lian go ?I still give it 3 stars because despite the letdown feeling of the ending, we get to meet new interesting characters such as Droma and Elan."
5,"Solo's back, and it's just like old times","Finally, an author that has studied up on his subject and actually researched the SW history before writing the book. He has successfully combined elements from every area of the SW timeline without messing up like others who have treid this. The battle scenes in this book are well-written, on par with Stackpole. In fact, I wouldn't mind seeing Luceno write a Rogue Squadron book sometime. He did a great job in developing Han's character (and pulling him out of his hole of grief and self-pity). The plot was well-developed with great care to the details. I would have liked to have seen some Jedi action, but the book was about Han, so it's understandable. I also loved the way he ended the sixty year long cliffhanger about a lost Jedi. In short, the was a great book, masterfully written. Mr. Luceno, you did a wonderful job."
5,Wonderful New Edition to the NJO,"It's Han's time to shine in this wonderfully written book. Yes, after all the attention the Jedi received, Luceno masterfully focused on Han Solo, bringing out the potential and strength to face the death of Chewie and the yearning for vengeance. Luceno succeeded beautifully. The charachters(especially Han, duh) show depth and feeling, the action is intense, the story has a smooth flow and amazing ideas, and the pages fly by fast. This book is really good. I am looking forward to the sequel and I would recommend it for not the usual Star Wars fan, but rather someone who is looking to read a book with wonderful style."
2,If You Aren't A Han Fan . . . skip this book,"Fans of Han Solo will not be disappointed by this book as Luceno demonstrates he has explored every facet of Han's life thoroughly. There are numerous irrelevant references to Han's past scattered throughout the book as Han stumbles throughout the galaxy and befriends the Jar-Jar Binks of the EU, the insufferable, comedic creature called Droma. We have Han stumbling through the galaxy in an attempt to help Droma find his clan-mates; in doing so, Han manages to stumble across the latest Vong scheme and accidentially foil it.With the exception of the Vong scheme, the rest of the book is just useless filler, but then I'm not a Han fan."
5,Han Solo returns,"This book is a great way to return to Han as the main character. So far the other books in the series have been based on Rouge Squadron or on all of the main characters Luke, Leia, Han, etc.. This is also one of the best descriptive books of the series, you can almost see the Yuuzhan Vong cruisers attacking. This book is a worthy continuation of the series."
5,good,James Luceno did a great job with this book. It really gave Han Solo some character. Although I don't agree with him running away...
4,"Finally, find out what's going on with Han!","Han Solo has been a mess ever since the tragic events of VECTOR PRIME. Chewie's demise left our favorite smuggler wracked with guilt and anger, and the fact that he has become an object of pity among his friends and collegues in the New Republic has only made Chewie's absence that much more painful.But now Han finally has the chance to get revenge for his best friend's murder. Han leaves his friends behind to go on a solitary mission that may end in his death...a mission to strike at the very heart of the Yuuzan Vong invasion force in a way that the massive New Republic military never could. The only question is, will Han's thirst for vengeance put him in grave risk against impossible odds? As Han would say, ""Never tell me the odds!"""
2,(yawn) boring,"I realize all of those who have written reviews for this book already are going to hate me for this, but I really disliked this book. It was boring. It had to much Han, not enough of the other characters. The parts I liked were the ones with Anakin and Jacen. I would recemend skimming this book, because there are quite a few important plot points, but I really did not like it."
3,Cool book for wise men.,This is a cool book. Informative and also thought provoking with it's definitions ranging form Indian to what a Hindu really is. Also check out few more titles like The 100- A ranking of the most influential persons in history.
3,Mixed emotions,"Not unlike the heroine, I have many mixed emotions about this book. I owned a copy many years ago but lost it somehow. I don't really care for the hero or the heroine but somehow this a book that you just can't put down. Janet Dailey really knows how to draw you in. It mirrors real life in the sense that you can find yourself involved with someone that you don't particularly care for through their force of will and sheer determination. Personally speaking, I have experienced this with several friends and former boyfriends. Think about it."
4,Let's see if it works!,"My husband and I loved the ""Happiest Baby on the Block"" so we're hoping ""Happiest Toddler on the Block"" works just as well! We just watched it today so we'll see. Only thing about the DVD is the annoying song the guy sings at the beginning and end so it's inevitable you're going to listen to it! LoL"
1,The Happiest Toddler on the Block DVD,"Very detailed, very informative DVD that helps parents understand and feel better about going through the ""toddler years"" with their child."
2,Wouldn't play on computer.,"Never watched. The DVD wouldn't play on my computer. Needs to be updated. I loved his first book, but technology moves on Dr. Karp needs to move with it."
3,Good but not great,"We LOVE our Happiest Baby On the Block DVD, as a matter of fact I buy it for every pregnant mommy I know as it is a must have. When I saw that Dr. Karp did a Happiest Toddler on the Block DVD I had to buy it. I was not as happy with the content in this DVD and I felt that some of the toddler work was ridiculous. I would have preferred it if his approaches were tailored to the personality of the toddler you are raising. My little boy does respond to the exercise of crying with him and repeating what he is trying to say however none of the others. He just looks at me like I am nutty. I am giving it three stars because one of the exercises did work and I like the 5 S's in HBOB."
5,Excellent,What a concert! Excellent performance by Donny. His sons' performance with him is a treat. a must have for any Donny lover or to make a fan! will gaurantee that you will want to watch this yearly and that it will not get old.
1,They did it to me again!,"When I purchase a CD I really care about the way it's presented in orderto prevent what I most hate...Re-recordings, that means not the originalstuff. Well, they fooled me again. Nothing on the outside makes youdoubt because it says ""18 classics by Pat Boone"" and I thought I wouldfinally receive Pat's greatest songs because they are all there. Wrong!!Here we have a bunch of re-recordings some of them being patheticespecially Speedy Gonzalez, Bernadine, Love Letters In The Sand etc.They did it to me again!"
3,So small,"This is a cute toy - my son (and I) love all the toy food that uses hook and loop. Especially love the plastic vs. wood, because it is more washable, and wood tends to start to dent and chip overtime (based on our experience). Plus, I'm always nervous about what kind of paint they use on the wood. Anyway, the toy itself is cute, but wow, it is SMALL. Like really really small. Once assembled, it's a 3"" x 5"" burger with a small plastic knife. It is not worth more than 5 bucks at most. The plastic is rather squishy, so I'm wondering how long they will hold up. We have all the other Small World food sets and they are all small, which is perfect for my son's play kitchen and his small hands, but it's the price that I'm not crazy about."
5,Great fun!,"I purchased quite a few of these play foods for kids and they are all terrific. The colors are bright and they are very durable. The velcro to hold the pieces together is such a good idea. They are very easy and fun to use. I have also purchased the pita pockets, ice cream, pizza, fruits, veggies, sandwiches, etc.I bought them for my niece who is 4 and we all have a fun time with them."
1,Deflating Pool! Act Now!,"This pool does not stay inflated. Couldn't use it, because within hours of filling it with water, the air would be gone from it. There was no obvious holes upon inspection. Can't figure it out."
1,Deflates,I didn't believe the other reviews which said it deflates but it is true. I couldn't even try it out because it started deflating instantly.
3,Disapointed,"Love the pool and shape, but already has a hole in it and it is only 3 weeks old. The one patch they give you is about 2 inches by 2 inches."
5,Intex Swim Center Family Lounge Pool,"VERY NICE!!!!! I BOUGHT IT FOR MY 1 YEAR OLD GRANDSON AND WE HAD A BLAST IN IT THIS PAST SUMMER, EASY TO CLEAN, AND PRETTY COOL WITH THE LITTLE SEATS! WE PUT HIS CHAIR AND UMBRELLA TABLE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE POOL SO HE COULD HANG ON WHILE WALKING AROUND...VERY FUN!"
1,Arrived with a puncture that had been ineffectively patched,"This is a nice pool - my wife and I have used it with our daughter and we didn't feel cramped. The seats aren't as comfortable as the picture suggests.The reason I can only give this one star is that I took it out of the box and noticed that one of the seats had already been patched with an ugly brown puncture patch. Sure enough, when I inflated the pool, that seat quickly deflated. I suppose I am lucky that the puncture was in one of the seats, so it didn't affect the rest of the pool. But who finds a puncture and patches it before passing a pool off as new? Very disappointing."
4,Even adults will love this pool!,"Full disclosure: I do not have kids, I purchased this pool to entertain myself and my friends. This ""kiddie pool"" is sized perfectly for 4 adults to lounge in, and you could even fit 6 if you squeezed! Each corner of the pool has an inflatable seat and head rest, and fully grown adults could sit in the corners and barely have their feet touch in the middle! The water level is pretty generous, probably about 1 foot and half, two feet... Enough to cover your waist sitting down. I purchased this pool in 2009 and its still kicking in 2011! (Granted I only pull it out of storage a couple of times a year, and its only used by adults looking for a place to sit and have a quiet beer; not rambunctious kids jumping around putting undue wear and tear on it.)My only complaint is that it only has two built in cup holders. It would have been nice if each seat had its own cupholder, but oh well."
2,Arrived with multiple small holes,"Item is bigger than it seems in the picture. Upon filling with air for the first time, one of the ""seat cushions"" has a small leak that takes about 8 hours to deflate. In addition, the main pool container also has a small leak somewhere, so it needs additional air every day. I will be returning the item as it should not have 2+ leaks right out of the box. Poor quality control, apparently."
2,doesn't hold up,"I bought this at Big Lots for about the same price and the first time I used it, the thing kept losing air. Filling it with a hand pump is a total pain. Somehow one of the cushions got water in it because I didn't inflate them the first time I filled it. The cushions are pretty pointless because you can't even relax on them. I sat on it and leaned back and felt like i was going to fall out...and when the edge is losing air, it doesn't hold the water. So I have not had luck with this pool. Waste of time and money. Might have been nice if it weren't leaking so much air. I even tried to patch a spot and it still lost air."
1,Never got to use,Received the product in April in preporation for summer with grandson. Went to inflate in late May and main chamber leaked. Return period expired so we're stuck with it. Looks nice though!
2,Does not stay inflated - Listen to the reviews!!,I read the reviews but did not listen. The reviews were right and the pool does NOT stay inflated. I only used it twice. Definitely not worth it. Look for something else.
2,turned pink......,"I purchased this pool at a really great price! Just what I was looking for! After about 4 days however, the entire bottom of the pool turned pink!! Maybe it was a reaction of somesort, however it looks gross and makes me wonder, what chemicals etc are doing this... The pool looks horrible now, its functional, but I dont want to even use it...."
4,Nice Pool,"This pool is built pretty well and is bigger than one thinks. It takes a while to fill and there are no covers that fit. Also, I did have a leak after about a month of use and have been unable to find it as of yet."
5,Lounge Pool is awesome!,"We got this not as a ""toy"" but to cool off in this hot summer in Indiana. This was the absolute best price on Amazon. This lounge pool was easy to fill up with air. We decided to put it on our cement patio. I would suggest putting something under the pool to keep it from scratching the cement.We fill it with water and it's able to stay good for a week. I add about 1/4 cup of Clorox and mix it in each day and add a little water.We are able to use a regular raft to float on in the middle of this lounge pool while someone is sitting in the lounge chair. This is the best ever pool for ADULTS ever! This has been the best thing to cool off outside and to work on your tan! If you have little kids, you can sit in the lounge chair and watch them play right by your feet.I would definately recommend this."
5,Great pool!!,"This is a great pool! We all love it and everyone asks us where we got it. It's comfortable to sit in for adults and my toddler and her little friends have a great time in it, too!"
3,Where Are The Seats??,"This pool is a great size, easy to handle and fill. HOWEVER! The pool we received does NOT have corner seats which is a huge part of the reason we purchased this particular pool."
1,beware intex parts,"I have bought two pools from Intex.As products go, they are ok. merely OK.But what you should be aware of is if you need replacements parts, you are on your own.The filter pump went out after 4 months use.So I thought it would be easy to get a replacement part. Easy. Right?No. Most retailers will not carry these parts.You are at the mercy of Atex's very high prices if you order from them. Amazon lists them, if at all, at very high prices.Please BEWARE OF THE SHORTAGE of replacement parts, because like I said, you will be on your own.CRYING KIDS BECAUSE OF PRODUCT FAILURE IS NOT A PRETTY THING"
1,Lounge Swim Center,"OHHHHH I loved this pool the first day I had it, I purchased this in the winter, opened it on memorial day and we used it that day. There were about 5 kids playing in it, there is more than enough room for them and a adult. Ok so we used this theat one day and by the next morning there is a slow leak in the top portion of the pool. The area was CLEANED around the pool area so no sticks or anything could have done it. So I use soap and the air pump to blow it up as I am squirting it, come to find out the slow leak is near one of the CUP HOLDERS........... so I now have to pump up the top portion of the pool everyday before we get in it!"
4,it works,i purchased this pool for it is the onlly one that is legal without a fence and alarm in my area. it definetly serves the purpose of cooling off and getting wet. my 3yr old grandaughter loves it. the only problem i see is all the dirt andclunk all seem to go behind the seats and you can not get behind to clean it. also the white bottom shows every dirt and whatever i lprefer blue bottoms. but for the price it does serve its purpose. i give it 3/1/2 stars. next year my 8x30 easy set up pool inclosed with a fence and pool alarm.
1,Used once,"I bought a pool from you a few years ago ,that was the best !! you stop carrying that one!! I bought this one at the end of the season it was a good deal I thought !! Did not use until Memorial Day there was a hole in the crease ,so I said okay I will buy some pool patches from you and fix the problem !!patches did not work either !! I just wanted to get one season out of the Pool !! after patching the pool twice and it still did not hold air !! had to pump the pool up every hour for the 4th of July !!this is a bad product !!I still have the other pool on my wish list maybe some day you will get them in again !!those were the coolest pools !!I can not return this one I took scissors to it in anger an threw it out !!"
1,Caved wall,"We purchased this yesterday for $40 from Big Lots. Unfortunately, after laying down a tarp, blowing up the pool and filling with water below the fill line last night.....we woke to a pool with a caved in wall and a large portion of the water drained. I know we didn't put it on the most level ground but my guess is there's a leak somewhere. I've moved the pool to a more level area and giving it another go. If today doesn't turn out better, this one gets returned. We have had the Intex 10 x 30 (which we gave away), it held up wonderfully. We also had a 12 x 36 Intex which I tore a hole into when cleaning it out at the end of season but even though I did a number on it, the patch and duct tape kept it going strong the 3rd year...it was the inflatable ring on top which finally started leaking and we couldn't find it to repair. I'll be back to leave another review if this one holds up."
1,Arthrin,"My dog ate these just fine but my vet said it is not safe to give aspirin to dogs, ever ever. Be careful and be aware."
2,Crude Start to the Series,"This is actually the first film of the Dudu series,""The love bug rally"".Basically it plays off the racing success of Herbie The Love Bug.The car (or one that looks a bit like it) is played off as the actual Herbie,repaired repainted and re-dubbed Dudu.In actuality,this car is RHD not LHD and there is no cloth sunroof.A very slipshod,and not funny film with tons of errors and horrid editing.To think it did very well at the German boxoffice in the 1970s is rather scary.Later followup films 2,3(especially 3),and 4 are better than this one.And Sal Borgese, Eric Falk, Walter Giller, Evelyn Kraft are NOT in this film.They are in film 3 and 4."
4,Good,"Worked well, but way more than i needed to do my home. Was loaded with plenty of parts and good manuals"
5,Recommended Vendor,"This item was the OEM product so there is little to say for the fact that everything was in order and of sufficient quantity. The Schlage website is not the easiest to get around when you are looking for specific information and you have to weed through all of the sales literature. You may find as I did that the product details are just as confusing, however you can't go wrong if you just select this item to cover the lionshare of locks to re-key. Installation was a snap, but I'm fond of Schlage products. Recommended!"
3,Snap Art Discontinued by Crafthouse/Chartpak,"Sorry to say this product, Snap Art has been discontinued by Charfthouse/Chartpak.Sorry, no product replacement available at the present time, other than Lego and Duplo which are larger pieces."
4,does the job,I was very skeptical about this product after trying other foot creams that didn't work. This lotion does feel greasy when you put it on and very thick.When it dries the results are worth it because when you wake up your feet are dry and the cracked skin is repaired.I would recommend this product.
4,Jesse! now Jerome! yaaeees!!,"Somebody bring me a mirror!! Morris Day and the Time are true classics. iF you happened to have been in a cave during the 80s, not only did they provude all the comedy and jokes in Purple Rain but their live sequences were some of the best. Only Morris Day could perform choreography on stage with a butler!! Dont be fooled by the number of songs on here, each one runs extra long. The Walk and Gigolos Get Lonely are among my favs."
