4,it gets old,now I am a big fan of Kirby in Super Smash Brothers but this game gets old. I like the idea of combining enimies powers and using them but the game is way too easy to beat. If you dont want to give up on Kirby i suggest you save your money and wait until the next Kirby adventure comes out. I hope you find my advice useful.
3,3D Side-Scroller is OK,"Ever play Kirby's Dream Land for Game Boy? Or Kirby's Adventure(great game) for Nintendo? That's about as complex as this game gets. The weapon combos are awesome, but this game has absolutely NO replay value, as do most games of this genre. This isn't a very difficult game; in one rental, you could probably beat it. The kids'll enjoy this for a rental or two, but it'll be a game that sits....and sits.... and sits..... in the back of the drawer if you buy it. This should've never been a N64 game."
3,Makes You Long for Old-School...,"Kirby was definitely one of my favorites for the regular Nintendo way back when... Unfortunately, I never actually owned it. To make up for that dumb mistake, I made another by purchasing this game... There's really not much skill involved... If a specific ability is required, the area will have a color indication of which one is needed... Basically if you're going to play a game that moves in one direction (mainly forward), get something like Crash Bandicoot for the Playstation, something that represents some semblance of a challenge... Kirby needs to make the jump that Mario and Zelda have made..."
3,Easy to play side-scroller,"Kirby returns in a big way in this new N64 game. While it is mainly aimed at kids, it is an all-around fun game that is easy to get into and start playing.The graphics are colorful and cute, and Kirby is busy eating everything in sight. This game is a true side scroller that fails to break any new ground, but it is still a worthwhile purchase."
4,Better than the original,I really enjoyed playing this game. I have to admit it is much better than the original. This game has definetly exceeded my expectations. The game is fun to play and I highly recomend getting the game if you're a avid nintendo Player.
2,Do you like Kirby?,"If you have played other Kirby games and enjoyed them don't get this one (unless the only Kirby game you have played was Kirby's Dream Land 3 for SNES.) This game was the first Kirby game I ever got and at first I really enjoyed it. Until I got Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land for GBA. Compared to Nightmare, Crystal is very bad. I got online and looked at all the other Kirby games and decided this was the second worst in the series. I recently got other games like Metroid Prime and Super Mario Sunshine (which wasn't that good) and saw that they were also better than this game. If this was the only game I owned I would give it 4 stars."
2,This Game Is Not So Good,"Well at first when I purshased Kirby 64 The Crystal Shards, I expected it to be good. It was a little bit but it is WAY too short.I beat it the second day I got it! If you want to get this game I recommend that you ... rent. ..."
2,not the typical kirby game,"THIS KIRBY GAME IS NOT AS GOOD AS IT SEEMS! They forgot the main characters like gooey or rick and his animal friends! And, worst of all, this game only takes a few hours to beat! This kirby game is geared for VERY young gamers, like 4,5,6. You should buy the rare gameboy game, kirby tilt and tumble, or go to funcoland.com to buy kirby's super star for the snes and the other old kirby games to see the best of kirby! Lots of people that own kirby websites agree with me( ex, kirby's rainbow resort). Buy this at your own risk!!"
2,Kirby 64: the big bust,"Hey I hyped it up when the game came out. But in the end it is not that challenging i beat it in 2 hours. The only thing cool in this game is kirby and the different kirbys he can change into, but it gets old so.... But it is a game to rent but not one to buy. Save yourself so money and buy a good game. Such as, Zelda: Majora's Mask, The World is Not Enough, Banjo-Tooie,or Perfect Dark."
3,Fun for awhile,"This game is fun for about 2 days. this game is alot like Yoshi's Story, you can't move all directions. This game is very easy to beat. This is not a must have. borrow it if you must"
5,Kirby is more fun than ever!!,Kiby is back and tons more fun. This thing called Dark Matter. The dark matter wants the crystal. You must go to all 6 worlds to get them back. At first this game is easy. I beat the game in 1 week. But then I found 2 things that kept me playing for months. 1. Kirby can do many cool attacks. This is how. You might [get] a fire power. ( Ther are 7 different powers. ) Then you spit it out on a enemy that has a cutter power. You get a fire sword. There are so many different powers. 2. There are three different mini games that you can play with 4 people. This game is great for Kirby fans.
1,i recieved a broken item,"This Product Is A Nice Product To Have , But The one I Recieved Was Broken, And When I Contacted Them About it, They Said That They Would Ship Me One Back Right Away. And They didn't , cause they also told me that they would let me know when it had shipped and so far it hasn't."
1,Army Men World War,"I was very disappointed with this newest addition to the Army Men series. Compared with the last release, Army Men Sarge's heroes, this game is terrible. With other games out there like Medal of Honor and Sarge's Heroes, this game is like playing Pong (the original Pong) I can describe this game in one word... primitive. Don't waste your time (or your money) They obviously didn't put any effort into this game at all (and it shows)."
4,No cooperative two player mode like Air Attack,This game is good on the easy setting. But it lacks the two player mode for cooperative play like Air Attack has. Prerelease information from 3do indicated there was a cooperative 2-player mode. Not the greatest; not the worst.
1,DON'T BUY THIS GAME!,"The other day I went out and bought Army Men:World War ....... I had played Army Men 3D and Army Men:Sarge's Heroes earlier that month for the first time, and I thought they were very fun, so I thought World War would only be better. IT IS NOT. Choppy Graphics, some of the worst controls I have ever seen in a game, and AI that is either entirely too dumb, or way too smart. The only fun level is the gunboat level in the second area, but all the rest are boring and repetitive. Don't buy this game, instead go buy Army Men 3D or Sarge's Heroes, cause they are more fun .................."
5,A really fun record and a great introduction to Carl's music,"This is probably Carl's most song/vocal-oriented CD. It continues, in a way, where Slang Justic left off. Much of the material reflects a Beatles and a strong blues influence and on the opening cut, you can hear a bit of Eric Johnson. The songs are really good and Carl has the good taste to know when to wail on guitar and when to hold back. If you dig great guitar tones, you'll find this album to be a real treat."
4,Another Good Release by Verheyen!,"Verheyen is a true guitar virtuoso. His past experience includes performing with many jazz musicians such as Dave Grusin, Richard Elliott, Dan Siegel, Stanley Clarke and Max Roach. He has also played with the likes of Robben Ford and was the lead guitarist for Supertramp replacing guitarist Roger Hodgson in 1985.Slingshot is Verheyen's fourth release following the suprisingly good ""Slang Justice"". Unlike ""Slang Justice"" which leans heavily towards the blues, Slingshot leans more towards rock but does not totally abandoning what is some excellent blues guitar playing.As a blues fan, I was somewhat disappointed in this change of direction. However, as a guitarist, it's hard not to appreciate the playing on this CD. Overall a good effort sure to please rock fans and tone worshipers."
5,Excellence,"Very quick turn-around. Order placed, order filled within two days. Amazing. Excellent recording, excellent quality. Seller is very dependable."
5,Astrid Varnay is a wonder,"She completly dominates this video. And her acting is never over the top considering the character or even her age where this is a new medium for opera and some of the stock opera poses look so out of place when viewed up close . I've read Varnay's biography and was surprised to learn she was an American and was a great Wagnerian soprano in the 40's and 50's singing the big roles, Isolde, Brunnehilde, etc. What an artist! And this video was recorded when she was no longer in her prime, whatever that is. I would have loved to have seen her then. Also, I'd like to add that an awful lot of nitpicking is done in these reviews and I think of the old adage: them that do sing, them that can't critique. We are so lucky to be able to enjoy watching and in our own homes operas which only 60 or so years ago was only for the elite."
4,beaders review,"This book has a lot to teach you on the basics. And it is done very well. This is a great beginners book, with lots of easy to follow graphs and instructions. The simple bags work up nicly. I feel you will not be disapointed with this book."
5,Beaded Treasure Purses: Tubular Brick Stich Designs,Provides many hours of relaxation doing my beading and gave me ideas for other designs in making peyote bags.
3,Informative but a weak narrative,"How do you prefer your literary biographies? If you don't mind narrative that is interrupted frequently by literary criticism, then this is the book for you. I've written such books myself. But I've slowly come to the realization that what can't be told in narrative should probably be left out of a biography."
3,Quality Has dropped,"I just bought a new Troybilt Pony, electric start tiller. The first time I used it, within 30 minutes one of the ""welded on"" brackets fell off, allowing the clutch engage handles to drop down. Upon further inspection, I noticed several other places where the welds were poorly done but covered thoroughly with paint. So, I belive the quality of craftmanship has deteriorated some from the ""old days"" before MTD bought TroyBilt out. So, be sure to look your machine over, very carefully when you first receive it. It started and tilled just fine prior to the bracket coming off, but I am a little concerned about what may break or come apart next."
5,Delicious Espresso,"I just keep re-ordering this stuff. Great crema every time.Tasty, efficient, consistent. What more could you ask for ??"
2,Weak Espresso,"I've used three pods so far to see if it was something I'm doing, but it's not. The espresso is just weak. I'm going back to using ground Starbucks espresso."
1,Not very tasty,A little too earthy for my taste. I think I'll try something else next time. This product has a somewhat bitter quality to it.
2,Not a great flavor but cleaner than ground coffee,"I would rather spend the time and effort for a better flavor. The Pods are individually sealed, and easy to use. The flavor is not great at all."
4,"Convenient, could be a little smoother","I'm not a huge coffee aficionado so this is my layman's perspective. This was my first experience with ESE pods and I found them to be very convenient, with a slight improvement to the ground canister espresso. Although I prefer the smoothness of the Illy ESE pods that I subsequently purchased, these Lavazza pods are individually wrapped which although maybe not the most ecological solution do preserve the freshness of the coffee. I felt the price was fair for the quality and the conveneince."
4,Probably the best ESE pods you can buy,"I bought this to try an alternative ti the Illy pods we use at the office. The Lavazza pods are far superior, producing a flavorful and smooth expreesso with a delicious crema. the flavor is not too acid nor over reasted like Starbucks, you could say it is almost sweet.A number of people have thanked me for buying these. If you have an E.S.E. expresso machine you should try them."
2,Disappointing Flavor,"I have been looking for a replacement for Starbuck's discontinued pods. This one isn't it...tastes like plain ol' coffee, not expresso."
4,"Good espresso, good price but wrong packaging","I'm sure sure about buying from others or Amazon direct but I bought from Terry's Market seller. The 20 pack came loose in a bag, not in a box as stated. Not really a big deal, but it is nice to have a box on the counter instead of 20 loose packs. Basically they buy bulk and repackage. It has no impact on the espresso but thought this might help others."
3,Doesn't Work With All Machines,"I was excited when I saw these as I don't like the mess associated with making an espresso. However they do not work with my De'Longhi machine. As another reviewer stated, I ended up with ""tan water"". If I open the pods and pour the grounds into my machine they make a decent cup of espresso, but the idea was to avoid the mess."
3,"Functional, but not Bold","These pods work okay in E.S.E. compatible machines, and produce good crema.I prefer the ""Bold"" pods from Starbucks, both for the stronger flavor and the smaller ""tab"" on the side of the pod. The Lavazza pods' extra long tab can interfere with seating the assembly in the machine."
4,"Convenient, but not as good as fresh ground","I know that sounds obvious, but for the price (~$0.75/ea) I had secretly hoped for astounding quality.Pros:- Very easy to use- Good flavor (rich, but more coffee taste than espresso taste).- Easy clean up (no loose grounds)- Better flavor than competitors (side by side compare with Zicaffe' Cremadensa, and Lavazza was MUCH better)Cons:- Tastes like strong coffee rather than espresso- Expensive (a good value would be <$0.50/ea)Suggestion:- Keep a box on hand for quick drinks (serving guests who are not picky), and for quick use in lattes and other drinks where the taste of the espresso is not critical.- Use fresh ground for other occasions"
5,Yummmmm,Great espresso pods! Makes really delicious espresso and the pod function makes life so much easier not having to clean out all the grounds. Love love love these and have ordered them atleast 3 times already.
3,a bit harsh,"due to being ""gran crema"", I am suspecting that it has large quantities of robusta beans in it which gives me headaches. If you are willing to sacrifice crema for taste then I say try it. It is not too bad."
2,Doesn't make a strong cup of coffee,"I bought these pods to use with my existing espresso machine. I've seen the LavAzza brand at several coffee shops and thought I'd give it a try. For someone who enjoys strong cappuccinos and lattes, I found these pods to make a rather weak cup of coffee. I even tried adding in an additional shot, but found that it didn't help."
1,Lavazza Gran Crema Espresso Pods 20 pack,CRAP! Too weak! I put one packet in a cup of boiling water and it was weak as Bleep! Never again! Expensive-not worth the money.
4,"tasty, idiotproof","for the timid or useless, handy little packets. I keep some around for ""late rush"" mornings or severe hangovers."
1,Are these compatible with the senseo machine?,These are smaller than the senseo pods. Is there a special holder/adapter for these pods. It appears that the hot water runs around the pod.
4,Good coffee taste and aroma. Not so much creme,"This coffee tastes very good prepared as espresso, latte or cappuccino; either using the ristretto attachment or the regular length (we didn't like it as lungo... gets weak, but it is a matter of taste, of course).It has a medium roast amber-dark color when brewed and aroma that is very pleasant.It is almost sweet to the taste without extreme accents of bitterness.For people that prefers medium roast over bold toasted. This is a good choice coffee.Brewing using an Illy Francis Francis X1."
4,Nice coffee pods which are affordable,"Okay, it is not the best coffee out there, but for the cost, it definitely does the job. Make sure you pay well below one buck per pod."
2,mediocre,this coffee was only slightly above Dunkin Donuts brew. I compared it to two other brands; those i finished the quantities. these were disposed of.
1,Don't Buy,"The pods do fit into a compatible E.S.E. machine. However, the coffee isn't as strong or flavorful as your regular espresso from a cafe. Overall, you'd be much better off going for the ground or whole bean coffee. Don't waste your $10 bucks on this lousy product."
5,I'm Swallowing Valium As Fast As I Can!!!!,"This is a very sorry excuse for a movie about the consequences of abusing tranqulizers if your life isn't going too well. In this movie Jill Clayburgh plays a filmaker who is involoved in a pathetic relationship with a drunk, oh excuse me, I mean an alcoholic. Jill pops Valium like candy and it is no surprise that she ends up in the 1982 equivalent of Rehab for her drug dependancy. At the Rehab Clinic her psychiatrist makes the not too profound statement that 'You don't have to cripple yourself to be loved""Gee. I thought you didn't have to take 90 milligrams of Valium per day to be loved either. I give this movie 5 stars because Ms. Clayburgh did show some wonderful promise as an actress early in her career ."
1,This book is a fake. Much of it has been fabricated.,"""Blood and Banquets"" is a fascinating book and a good read. The reader thinks that he/she is getting a behind-the-scenes look at the Nazis' rise to power. It turns out that much of Fromm's book is fabricated. Historian Henry A. Turner has examined the veracity of the book in his article ""Two Dubious Third Reich Diaries,"" in the journal Central European History, volume 33, no. 3 (Sept. 2000). Turner shows why this book should be regarded with skepticism and not relied upon as a historical source."
2,Fiction,Current thinking is that Fromm fabricated alot of this book. No diary or journal is known to have existed. See the Bella From Wiki bio for details. The book was apparently written after her move to the US.
5,Solarweave SPF 50 Boonie Hat,Ordered the first hat in medium but was too small for boyfriend and looked good on me so I kept it! I ordered him a large so now we have matching hats! Will not be wearing them until boating season but they should be great!
2,"not firm, small.",in the discription it says it has a firm brim which is false. it's floppy and wouldn't hold up a penny.
5,Great hat to wear summer time,The hat arrived much soonner than it was promised. I wore it all this summer while doing yard work under the sun. It kept my head cooler. I wear it all the time. Buy a size slightly smaller than you normally wear.
1,Baby Hat,"I don't know who this hat is supposed to fit, but not a grown man. Very disappointed, am returning it."
5,Boonie Hat,"I bought this hat to take on vacation, as I knew I would be in a swimming pool quite a bit. It did a great job of keeping too much sun from burning the top of my head where you really can't put sunscreen on. It got soaked a few times but dried in a hurry and was none the worse for wear. A good bargain."
5,"Terrific hat, great value!","The hat arrived in a few days -- great hat for folks that work or play in sun. The vent holes provide ventilation, and the hat keeps you cool while working outside. The hat is true to size. The chin strap is handy on a windy day. I'm very pleased with this product, and would recommend this hat to my friends."
4,gift for my husband,"Although my husband hasn't tried the hat on yet since it's a gift, it looks nice and arrived soon after the order was placed."
4,good hat,"Great hat,durable,and sun proof. Great hat for sailing or just for a windy day. i give this a four star review manly because of its durability and because of its retractible string."
5,my favorite hat,This had is just as described. It fits well and is very compfortable. It has now become my favorite hat.
2,Not Embossed Too Well,Some seals are have been flattened so I didn't get to use some of them. It's hard to see the embossing on it. I didn't have time to exchange since I was doing the certificates for my daughter's class graduation from elememtary school. I had to pick and chose the best ones on the pack. Thank goodness there are more seals than what I actually needed.
4,Swingin Dino is incomparable but the love songs are mediocre,"It's a shame Dean and Nelson Riddle didn't do more together. The swinging part of this album is tremendous, with ""On the Street Where You Live"" being worth the cost of the CD alone (Capital, when are you going to bring out Dino's ""Swingin' Down Yonder""! ) The second half shows how songs can be ruined by the background chorus. In addition, many of those selections are lackluster to begin with. A fine CD overall, but this shouldn't be your first choice in exploring the rich legacy of song that Dean Martin has left us."
1,Bad for a 10 year old who likes science,"I bought this kit for my 10 year old son, and it was an exercise in frustration. He likes science, he likes electronics, and he likes things to work. This kit taught him almost nothing about electronics, and didn't really work very well at the end of 2 days of effort (with heavy assist from Father who used to major in EE). What a waste of money and his effort. All it did was teach him that kits are cheap and not worth the effort."
4,build it yourself radio,"I had fun working on this w/ my son, but it's not something to try to work on w/ 4 kids running around."
4,best kept secret in the music industry,this is cerebral rock and roll at its finest.Sam Bisbee writes rock melodies and lyricslike no other. It's like waking up from a 10 hour napand then having that feeling all day long - hismusic transcends the medium.
3,Jesus who?,"Wow! Hard to categorize this tome - part philosophy, part science fiction. Initial chapter is a proven remedy for insomnia. If you are in a hurry, just read Mathew thru John. A sad story about the son of God (yes, you heard correctly) spending 35 frustrating years in a third-world country. Desperate folks go to great lengths to seek his advice but come away confused by his obtuse down-home yarns. If you are looking for ""touchy-feely"", this is not your guy. Hard to relate to the main character (not suprisingly) with a single name ""Jesus"" (a la Cher) who, in the end fails to connect with his audience but mounts a comeback by setting into motion a fool proof plan that gets him crucified - go figure. The story hardly keeps you on the edge of your seat since everything is pre-ordained and known to everyone well in advance - which of course begs the question why was all this necessary?."
5,its the bible...hello!,best bible i ever owned. best bible for someone who hasn't explored the bible before.
1,Bad Review for This CEV Bible,"Bible is printed in China and has several misprints. Right away in Genesis where the word ""meat"" is to appear it instead says ""mean"". Don't buy under any circumstanceas this edition also has chinese interpretations of what Jesus says."
1,Does not Deliver,"This book claims that praying to this god will get you stuff you want... not true. I tried praying for a new car... I waited and got nothing. I then prayed a coupled of times to get this chicks number at the bar, again to no avail. I highly recommend that you try some other religion because this one does not deliver. Last week I tried the satanic bible... I then prayed for a cheeseburger and got it. I highly recommend trying the satanic bible over this one."
1,Yet again?,"Oh look another book about a God. Another translation by man. Then you go to church and your church puts the Spin on it that they desire.To be quite honest I find the characters are very one dimensional, way too much racism, sexism, and use of the word ""Damn"" while speaking of unspeakable tortures.The God in there is an angry tyrant the first half and the second half he's loving and just. This Jesus character who claims to be trying to make sense of everything speaks in Parables which means you have to translate everything he says.I can't help but feeling that all the authors that have been placed into this compilation lost track of the main goals that they were going for and really created a lot of confusion that would only lead to arguments and possibly oppression of people based on misinterpreted or absolutely wrong ideals.For this I feel this book is not worth anyone's time in reading unless you are a glutton for punishment and don't mind the lack of cohesive story throughout."
1,Disappointed in Connecticut,"I paid the ""guaranteed' over night delivery which was not extravagant but a lot more than 3 day delivery. I followed the delivery on line. It got to city it was supposed to be in on the day of the delivery, but was not delivered until 3 days later. I did not open the package and returned it. I will not be buying from Amazon or an Amazon partner again. Amazon.com is big on talk short on follow through."
4,An important tool for understand God's will today,"I`m still learning english and I love to read the Bible.So, why not both?The Holy Bible Contemporary English Version is an easy way to understand what God require, because it's user-friendly."
5,CEV Holy Bible,This Bible is so easy to read and understand. I like the print and the hard cover. A great buy.I bought it as a gift for a person who likes this version.
4,Very good face cleanser and moisturizer,"This is a very good product. It cleans well, without heavy perfumes or scents. It's very good for dry climates -- keeps my face from drying out and getting flaky. Use it once every morning and after workouts."
2,Not a great choice,"When I got this bottle, I was surprised at its size, at 8 oz it is only 0.4oz smaller than my shampoo. The first time I used it I understood why, it takes a pretty big bottle to fit all of that water into. This would be 4 oz of product if were a regular strength. The cleansing of the soap itself isn't while not bad isn't very good. It is not overly harsh and can be used twice a day with no problems. It just doesn't seem to me to have any lifting action. The smell is neutral and boring, but still present. 2 out of 5 seems very appropriate for this product."
5,Squeeky clean without drying,I like the MenScience face wash because it gets my face super clean without drying it out.
2,very soso,"Although it is pretty mild, it is still nothing special and not worth the money. I tried one bottle after reading its suprisingly good reviews on its website. After using it, I strongly suspect the fake customer's reviews on their website."
5,its a great product,"i have used a lot of other products on my face and they all make my skin dry and leave skin flakes which to me is a sign that theyre not cleaning the dead skin off my face. i really like the clean feeling i get, i have oily skin and it does a good job of cleaning without overdrying."
3,Neutral at this point,"Only half way through the bottle, I bought to help with keratosis pilaris and acne prevention can't say at this time if it's helped or not no significant difference. One thing I will say is this product smells like car wax or an automotive polish type product - to me anyway - so if your looking for something that has a sexy man scent this ain't it."
4,Positive Version of Busta?,"MG!The Visionary * TransparEmcee (Bec/Uprok, 2000)A frantic/whirlwind trip through the mind of former 3NP member (remember the ""Sanctifunktifyd"" compilation?), MG. And I do mean ""whirlwind"", because just listening to some of these songs will make your head spin. Witness the debut of the Gospel BUSTA RHYMES. Though a bit more Jazzy in groove theory, still, he's just as unpredictable.Picks: Rock Your World (reminiscent of""Sweetest Thing"" from the LOVE JONES soundtrack)LaZeric Fridell Freeman"
3,CLA,Because I just received this and have just started using it I rated it low. I haven't had enough enough time for a fair evaluation of the product but based I past reviews I decided to try it. I like reading the reviews before I purchase something and in most cases they are very valuable.
3,Benefits attributed to this product seem accurate,I fel this product has been beneficial. But I've only been using it for several weeks. Need more time to see.
3,Not what I expected,These tend to lose some oil and gathered in the bottom of the bottle. Did not really see or feel any different & think my fish oil supplement is a healthier option.
3,Conflicted in texas,"I purchased this product at vitamin world for 13.99 and did not lose any weight, but on the other hand it made my hair grow like crazy and it stopped breaking and shedding so much. I assumed it had to be the pills since i wasnt taking any other supplements nor was i doing anything different with my hair care routine. So i may be purchasing another bottle just for that purpose."
4,Waiting To See,This is one of those products you have to wait for the end results. I purchased it after hearing about it from a Clinical Nutritionist.
1,Seemingly ineffective,"After 3 1/2 months of use, my husband and I have seen no results with this product."
2,Just Finished My 3 Month Supply,"I have taken this as directed for the past three months. I did not see any real differences in my weight.You can try it out if you like, but my recommendation is to try something else."
1,Tonalin CLA and your Heart,"I was interested, and checked it out. Its scary bad if you have heart problems and any history of diabetes in your family. So look up what the researchers are saying."
4,Belly fat is less,"I've been taking CLA for about 5 weeks. I'm quite obese and I've noticed that my belly fat is shrinking more than usual when I'm restricting calories. I am eating about 1800 calories a day for the last four months and losing about 3-4 lbs a month. That is fine since I've lost hundreds of lbs. over the years and always gained it back. What I'm hoping is that I won't gain it back this time; that I can just continue eating the same, 1800, and my body, which fights me to gain, will be happy with the lower weight. One weird thing that I have noticed is that when I take Tylenol, it's doesn't work anymore. I take it 2-3 times a week for arthritis. I can't take NSAIDS so that is unfortunate."
4,Works with no side affects,I have been usuing this for a while and it seems to help me loose weight. I take it three times a day and went down a pants size. It is easy to swollow and had no taste. The price is great and I will buy again
2,Not for Everyone,"I purchased this after first seeing something on WebMD related to men possibly being overweight because of lack of CLA. (I'm female - but thought it might apply to me too!) I have been working losing weight, eating Primal/Paleo and before I started Tonalin I was losing weight. Then I started it - didn't change my good eating or exercise habits and gained a few pounds - but more importantly, felt like I was getting fatter! I tried for 3 weeks and then stopped. Since I've stopped, I've started losing weight again. I'm not saying it won't work for others. I am a firm believer in everyone having different body chemistries. It just didn't work for me."
3,CLA is working slowly,I have been taking CLA for 4 months and I noticed my thighs slimming and not so much my stomach like I was hoping for. I am seeing some slight improvement in my waistline lately. You need to take it at least 4 months to see improvement in your waistline. I noticed slimming in thighs in two weeks. I will continue using until December 2012 unless I see my waistline change more will use in 2013.
2,doesn't work,"Save your money on this one. It doesn't work. My friend and I bought one bottle to share, because we are sick of buying product that doesn't work, and yes, this one is another miss."
4,Felling Full Fast,"I feel very full faster when I take this pill before/during meals. Almost to full after only having so much of a meal but I guess it helps with hunger control and appetite. I haven't gotten much results in terms of weight loss, yet I haven't taken it as consistently as I should each day. Only because it is a bit difficult to remember to take the pill and then make sure that I have the amount that I need for the day."
2,No positive results,"I have been taking Tonalin for a few weeks, 6 pills a day, and have seen no results. How long does it take to see even the slightest benefit? Needless to say, I am a bit disappointed, and if I finish the bottle, and still see nothing, I will not be buying again."
3,cla,So far I have been pleased with the results. Took longer then I thought to receive this item though. Thanks
3,not sure what it does,I am not quite sure what it is doing but i keep taking it guess its not hurting or helping.
2,Beware of this,"This product is misleading, it does not contain 1200 mg of CLA.It's a proprietary blend oils, so we do not know how muchCLA it contains. GNC had a better version."
2,Disappointed,I was disappointed with the kit. It was displayed better than the actual product. The items are really things you can get at any store.I wished I had known before I ordered it.
2,a good disaster -emergency pack,Great price...looks great..Lot of emergency medical stuff inside. The bag was smaller than I wished. But for the money it ill work well. If you plan on adding much to the kit the bag is small....You will need to purchase a large bag some place else. I did. I found a back pack at k-mart and transferred all the medical stuff to it.
4,no mention of a Handbook,OK kit for the average untrained professional and family.. Unfortunately most citizens are not trained in First Aid anymore and no mention of a Handbook was included to explain how/when to use the supplies.
3,a decent starter kit,this kit doesn't have it all but it has enough of the basics to get you started on building a good kit it was a great buy for the price of 40 bucks it would cost more than that to buy all the components separately elsewhere.
1,Seller never responded for a damaged goods,"There was a hole in the food item (Mayday emergency food rations) and I contacted the seller attaching the picture together, but never got an answer back.If it was some other item that was damaged, then I would just be ok because it's not something that edible, but this is something you need to eat and I don't know what kind of things got into that hole and I don't want to take this damage.If you are the seller, please contact me and replace this item."
3,Like the kit...but,What they do not tell you up front is that the items in the kit have a one year expiration date and they want you to sign up for annual replacements.
4,Quakehold 70280 Emergency Pack,"This is great for an emergency, the pack has the vital things like water food bars. enough for three daysI think this pack is a great starting point. I think it would be good to create your own grab and go. I put things in there that are not included in this pack. plus I bought my own back pack which is far larger.This pack is small. Some of the items in my larger pack quality compass paracord leatherman 300 multi tool waterproof matches. magnifying glass. water treatment tablets extra emergency blankets flint starter. A small hammerExtra bandages, I am not finished with this yet, but you get the idea things you may not be able to do withoutin any emergency situation. I do recomend the quake kit!!!But also make your own you can never be over prepared."
1,"Mislabeled, Really Child's Supplimental Survival Kit","As pointed out in other reviews, this product is mislabeled. It is really a 2 small children or 1 large pre-teen child supplemental survival kit. It is totally inadequate for 2 adults or teenagers, and might do in an emergency for 1 adult if generously supplemented.Basically, you would be buying this for the additional food and water.So, it is good only as a child's survival kit backup to a 3-4 person family survival kit.One task I had to perform was putting all the water vulnerable items in zip-loc quart and gallon bags to protect them against drenching rain."
2,Not so fast!,"I order ""Quakehold! 70280 Grab-n-Go Emergency Kit"" for $45 but then also ordered ""Deluxe 2-Person by SurvivalKitsOnline Perfect Survival Kit for Emergency Disaster Preparedness"" for $99 and you get so much more with that puppy. The Quakehold pack is 1/4 the size and full. The SurvivalKitsOnline pack is larger with way more pockets and has room for other items to be added. I stuffed the Quake items into the SurvivalKitsOnline pack. Also added a knife sharpenter and military compass, 5-in-1 shovel, bowie knife, 150 feet of rope and cord, all-weather gloves, plus more to be added. It still has room. Sure the pack tops around 40+ #'s but you have everything in it. Prepare your bug-out kit bB4 you need it people!!"
3,Decent,"Would reccomend just making up one of these yourself. That way you can add and subtract things and buy nicer things. Its a good idea but alot left out some stuff you dont need and things very cheapy- you get what you pay for kind of thing- it was cheap so not like upset about it. The ""food"" is awful so get something to replace that, its so hard its unedible and hard to even break up with a knife. Again I would just buy your own pack and your own stuff just use the list of what this has as a general guide."
4,"For the price, cannot beat it","The bag is crap, but the amount of thing in it are useful. I replaced the bag, and the water with potable water agents. Very good bag if you dont want to nickle and dime yourself to death."
4,A MUST HAVE!,"No complaints. It has your basic essentials. You can add stuff to your backpack. I added a knife, wet naps, a much better first aid kit, matches, pen, goggles, and a few other minor things not included in the kit.overall, it was a great purchase. I recommend everyone have a kit. You never know when you're going to need one.The backpack is small and great to place anywhere around your house.go online and search for other items you can include."
4,Great as a safety starter,"Better to be safe, right? It definitely provides the basics and price is pretty reasonable compared to other packs I've seen. Of course it doesn't include everything two people might need in every kind of disaster, but it lists everything that is included and each person can decide if they need more or not. I've added a little multi-tool and flashlight and will probably add more, like an emergency radio, as I come across them."
5,Thanks!,I bought a ton of gifts for christmas presents for co-workers. We had a holiday party and needed things to give out. This gift was perfect and shipping was fast! Thank you!
3,Needs better quality bag,I would say the bag quality is not very good. I for sure would not want to carry this on my back for too long. The contents of the bag seem to be okay quality. At the very least this is a good start to a bug out bag and would be much better to add the contents of this bag to a better quality bag. I would give 4 stars if the quality of the bag was better.
4,You never know!,"Due to recent event's my husband and I started planning the ""what-if scenario."" Bought this product to get started, a lot of useful products for just in-case. Everything looks good, the back pack is a little on the cheap side but what do you expect for the price. Didn't buy for the bag bought for what the bag contains! Neatly packaged and surprisingly well organized! Will definitely buy from this seller again!"
5,Rally fan,This game was a bit hard to get into but once I spent an hour learning the controls I became very fond of them and coupled with the fantastic graphics this game beats Colin. - The best rally game available on the PSX!
3,i expected more..but still pretty good,"There are a lot of different driving scenes when playing in one person mode which i like. But in 2 person mode there is only about 6 different scenes. They should have the same amount of scene selections for any player mode. that was my biggest problem. And i would have also prefered an in car view, the only option is viewing the car from the outside when driving. It's still a fun game to play in one person mode, if you're looking for a fun extended two person play, i might recommend playing anoother game."
5,Great piece of work on Ozark life and basketball history !,What a wonderful book! Leon Combs is a great storyteller. Living in the Ozarks and near the Bradleyville area most all of my life I could really visualize the story. The characters and situations were like telling a part of my own family and hometown history. The play by play of the basketball games was like being there in that place and time. I would love to see it on the big screen! I'm ready for the next book Mr. Combs.
4,The best lotion ever!,"Keri's Age Defy lotion was the best thing I ever used on my skin, especially in the warmer months. My skin was hydrated and I also had basic UVA/UVB protection. Unfortunately, Keri decided to stop manufacturing this product. I even wrote a letter to the manufacturer to voice my disappointment, but I never received a response. Bummer!"
2,The Gameis O.K,This game is o.k but it takes to long to load and even loner to load on a PS2 system I was not apeccting anything better that it was because Acclaim because they can;t make wreslting games and when I go into death math mode I only got the table in the corner of the area once in about 20 times. But I loved the barded wire math the should make more wwe game with blood or a on or off button for the blood. The finishers ...or rvd to do the five star frog splash you have to beat your oppent to a pult and you have to pree way too many buttons. I have played this game on the N64 and it is much better on N 64 than on playtation . I wold rent this game first then buy it ...
4,ECW Hardcore Revolution,"If you liked WWF Attitude for the playstation than this is the game for you. If you are getting sick of Attitude, which personally I don't think is possible, than you should buy this game. It has all of the ECW wrestlers from before the ECW went out of business and it has a lot of cool matches. My favorite match is a barbed wire match were the ropes are exchanged for barbed wire.When you whip your opponent into the ropes their back gets all bloody. This is probably why they gave the game rating of ""M"" for mature. Still this is one of the best wrestling games of all time. I really like the fact that you get to beat the crap out of Paul Haymen when ever you want."
3,come on ecw,"Now I love ECW, I always watch it on TV. When i heard Acclaim made a game about it, I couldn't wait to get it. I played right when i got home and it was good, but everytime I kept playing it there was a lot missing. I mean the create-a-wrestler is great, the season is good, but it's nothing like the real thing. I miss Joey Styles saying his famous,""Oh my god!"" And there r no tables and thats what ecw is all about. everytime u see ecw on tv u see a table or more stacked on each other but in this game there's one and it is very hard to get it and u cant put them on the table and do the five star splash or anything except do a regular move. its a pretty good game and u will have fun with it but dont expect anything close to the real thing. and u cant go into the crowd or backstage and u can do moves on the weapons but nothing will happen it will dissapear i think acclaim made it too big of a hype with the barbwire match, and thats all this game has."
5,"ECW, ECW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","VERY COOL, but not for little kidsGREAT GRAPGICS, GOOD GAMEPLAY!not very many custom-wrestler parts.OVERALL IT IS VERY VERY COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL!!!!!!!!!"
2,ECW HARDCORE REVOLUTION,"Boring, boring ,boring. The worst ECW game ever. This game made ECW look like a complete joke. The graphics are horrible. The gameplay is boring. Overall this game sucks and is a complete waste if u buy it. They should sell this game for a dollar thats how bad it is."
1,THE WORST WRESTLING GAME EVER,"THIS, BEING THE FIRST OF ONLY 2 GAMES THAT ECW RELEASED SHORTLY BEFORE GOING OUT OF BUSINESS, IS THE WORST WRESTLING GAME EVER. THIS IS WORSE THAN ''NITRO'', WORSE THAN WCW VS. THE WORLD, WORSE THAN ALL THAT. THIS IS AN EXACT COPY OF WWE ATTITUDE ONLY WITH ECW ARENAS AND NAMES. SURE, ALL THE ECW FAVORITES ARE HERE, SUCH AS ROB VAN DAM, TAZ [WHO'S HIDDEN IN THIS GAME], JUSTIN CREDIBLE, RHYNO, AND MORE. BUT, THE GRAPHICS ARE BAD AND THE GAME IS A REAL BORE TO PLAY. UNLIKE OTHER WRESTLING GAMES, THIS HAS AN M RATING AND IS VERY PROFANE (...) AND VERY BLOODY. OTHER THAN THAT, NO BACKSTAGE ACTION, NO STAIRWAY TO HELL MATCHES, NO SANDMAN, AND ALMOST NO REAL ECW MUSIC TO EVEN HEAR, MAKES THIS THE WORST WRESTLING GAME OF ALL TIME. ECW FANS NEEDN'T EVEN BOTHER TO CHECK THIS GAME OUT."
4,big band classic chris mcdonald a green hill instrumental classic,if you like big band and you or a collector this session is very good a must have for the serious collectors
4,"Beautiful, dignified, but slightly biased.","The text of this bible is the best ever, since the Authorised Version, as far as dignity and readability are concerned. However, I have found a definate liberal bias in the translation. For example the Greek word for homosexual is translated ""sexual pervert"" in one passage of the REB; the actual Greek word is very specific. In fact Paul uses two Greek words in the passage one which refers to a person recieving a homosexual act, and one which refers to a person performing a homosexual act (there is no such distinction in English). Overall the translation is good and fair with the facts, but the reader should be aware of the translators' biases. On balance, these ""gaffs"" probably won't make much difference in the quality of a person's relationship with Jesus Christ."
1,Very Disappointing,"I played WM2K before this. When I looked at it, the barbed wire ring seemed nice, so I rented it.I wish I hadn't.It's got many features WM2K has, including Create-A-PPV, Career Mode and more. Throw in configurable matches, many known wrestlers and it seems this game is as good as WM2K. Right? Wrong. There were many things which irritated me a lot. Among the foremost were the impossibility of executing certain moves, like the Irish Whip (I wish I could just whip the enemy into the barbed wire). Another thing is that the commentator sometimes referred to the two wrestlers as ""Player 1"" and ""Player 2"", which annoyed me. The difficulty of a great deal more things, which could have been done with one mere button press in WM2K, served only to aggravate me (the manual doesn't even explain how to read the moves list found in-game). Overall, matching up fights and designing wrestlers is good for this game, but the core of it, the actual gaming, is lacking terribly. Don't buy it."
2,better games on n64,If you really want to play with ECW wrestlers then get WWf No Mercy and create an ECW roster. It will be better than attempting to enjoy this game.
4,Boys Will Be Boys!,"I personally am not a wrestling fan but it is real fun to watch my seven year old son and his Dad wrestle each other through the video game. Both, my son & husband say that the graphics & sound effects are pretty cool and I can see & HEAR them really enjoying themselves when they play. So I guess that means that they really like it."
2,IT .....!,"ECW is the same thing like WWF ATTITUDE,only worse.ECW's commentary man Joey Styles doesn't talk at all!WWF's commentary is better,they talk the whole time in a match.There's so many flaws in this game,I can't name them all.What I'm trying to say is,ECW ....!"
1,"This game is very, well BAD...",This game is so very lame don't by it unless u want to die of boredom. You will regret it if you by it!
2,There are better collections available,"This disc includes three legitimate hits; One Fine Day, Sweet Talkin' Guy and Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow? All three are originals and sound just fine. However, taken as a whole, the album includes too many covers of other groups' material and too many obscure cuts to be taken seriously.This album is fine in a pinch or as a last resort but, if you have the time, find one of the more complete compilations."
1,for suckers only,"This collection is missing ""He's So Fine"", one of The Chiffon's most famous hits. Also, this collection is not remastered and is only 23 minutes long! Get ""Absolutely the Best!"" on Fuel 2000 records."
3,no frills,"This is a very nice selection. The essentials like the still incredible 'One fine day', but also their not so often included but great, soulful and better-than-the-original version of Little Eva's 'the Locomotion'. Good value for money, not the definitive collection, though..."
1,loose gems get lost,"First of all, these are pretty small, but look nice, and are colorful. I ordered and received them at the end of Nov., and gave them to my girlfriend for Christmas. She loved them, of course, but within a week, each earring had lost a setting, and the 30 days return time had expired. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THESE!!!!!!!!!"
2,Purchased fo kyb struts,"Hi, I just fit struts all four sides but I am not satisfised because after installation my is jumping and it doesnot absorbs the shock so ,I am going to return back and find some another brandThank YouBhupesh Pandya"
2,Hog Hunting Review,"I was disappointed in this book on wild hog hunting. The author went on a number of guided hunts and then wrote stories about those hunts. He does not come across as an expert, but rather someone who simply wanted to write a book and had the resources to do so.This doesn't mean that the stories aren't interesting. The author writes a good hunting story. He also hunts in different places in the USA which makes his book applicable for many places geographically. He also includes information about javelina's which I didn't know much about.I also purchased Wild Hog Hunting by Dave Sturkey and Craig Marquette and found this to be a much better treatment of the subject."
3,A reall find for avid Tull fans.,"CD #1 is what would have been the follow-up to Thick as a Brick. The recording sessions were such a disaster that the album was shelved. When Tull returned to the studio they started fresh and recorded Passion Play. The songs on this CD are mostly forgettable.CD #2 contains songs that for one reason or another never made it on a Tull Album. Here is where you'll find some good stuff: Man of Principle, Silver River Turning, I Don't Want To Be Me, Truck Stop Runner, Broadford Bazaar, etc. Small Cigar is a fun tongue and cheek look at the beauty of cigar smoking -- written in 1974, it's quite topical today!Since the songs were produced over a decade or so it's fun to listen to the band trying straight rock, folk, country and more."
1,Disappointing!,"I have heard soundtrack scores like this one and it's the same thing: a mediocre movie trying to have music that makes it seem more powerful than it really is. What it ends up being is an overrated, over-the-top soundtrack blown way out of porportion to a movie for six-year-olds! I am highly disappointed in whoever arranged this soundtrack. It was just plain 'trying to be cool', not telling a story at all. I thought they knew better."
5,Two classic albums for the price of one.,Two of Vikki Carr's great '60s album are combined on this one disc. A truly fine set from one of the great pop singers of her time.
3,A Tour of One of America's Literary Capitals,"I've never been to Chicago, but my wife has. And on her last trip there she picked this book up for me. At first I barely glanced at it, but then one night I was looking for something to read and began to scan through it. I finally put it down several hours later, amzed at how engrossed I had become.I did not realize how many well known authors had roots or connections to Chicago. The information is concise and has just enough detail for anyone interested in a who's who of Chicago literature, as well as the bookstores to hit when you're there.Who knows, maybe someday I'll finally get there and really put this book to use."
5,Intriguing Literary Mystery,"I have read quite a few books by this author lately and I am impressed by the way he tells a story. The plots are intricate and involved,with many unexpected twists and turns, yet at the end everything is explained in a way that leaves you satisfied as a reader. His books usually touch upon a deeper meaning and his characters are both flawed and likeable. I also enjoyed Into the Blue, Borrowed Time and In Pale Batallions."
1,As it says CHAOS ?!!,"This DVD version of the film is not original because its in Arabic and a bad quality to , its obvious is been done on a P.C using Nero , the original version of the movie was released in France although is the name of the movie on the DVD Cover is written in french the movie it self wasn't produced there ?!!"
4,Entertaining and Thought-Provoking,"The author did a good job of showing the personal and social consequences of sin. Jade and Tanner come off as likable, sympathetic people who do what we all do - sin. Here we get to see its consequences magnified and dramatized. (As a Catholic, I couldn't help thinking how much the characters would benefit from a good, sacramental confession not only so that they could know their sins had been absolved but also for the graces they would receive in helping them avoid temptation.)The book also serves as a warning about the ever-growing threats to our religious liberty in the U.S., where secular humanism is having a profound impact.It was both an entertaining and thought-provoking book."
5,A Moment Of Weakness,"I had read it long ago. Love Karen Kingsbury. I have not read her latest,but am looking forward to it!"
5,love it,"I read all of her books right now, and can't wait to get all of them, she is a great writter."
3,Depressing,"I have to admit the writing was fairly good and the books in this series evoked a lot of emotions in me. Of the three stories, this one was my favorite. I would recommend something more uplifting, though, because days later, despite the happy endings, I still felt down."
1,a moment of weakness,"It was emotionally over the edge, too picture perfect. Even though she didn't do the right thing right away, (she lied to her husband) everything turned out just fine. So it says in an unspoken way,the end justifies the means. Very unrealistic. A huge disapointment after her last book."
3,Flaws without a printed errata sheet,"The very first sweater I tried from this book has HUGE numbers of typos, and there is no errata sheet available. The instructions are fairly clunky in their layout, and after finishing this sweater I will most likely toss this book away. I understand that proofreaders won't catch everything, but many of the errors could have been caught through simple addition (i.e. if we begin with ""y"" number of stitches, by casting off ""x"" number will there be enough stitches for the next step, or shouldn't the number of inches required for the large by necessity be LARGER than the number of inches for the small?) The errors would have been so easy to catch--this book is sloppy and not worth buying."
2,Only buy if it's absolutely required,The only reason to own this book is if it's essential to your grade. The essays cover topics you could research as well online.
4,An OK game,"This game RULES on N64, because they're 4 players, here only 2. Not as much fun... If you want this game, get it on N64."
4,Excellent Game,"This is an excellent game. I happened upon it and decided to buy it, since I loved the N64 version, and the gameplay is much the same. It is incredibly fun, and can be played in co-op which is amazing. The graphics aren't the best, and sometimes the tanks are hard to control, but they're TANKS. An excellent game, and not too hard nor too easy to beat."
4,sweet,had this game quite a few years ago when ps1 was all the rage....just got it again and finally got to hear those famous words again... NUKE DEPLOY!....great game for its age.
2,K-TEL International 40 Greatest Part 1,"In 1975 K-TEL International (UK) LTD assembled a compilation of Perry's songs titled ""Perry Como ~ 40 Greatest"" which earned a Gold Record for Perry in the UK. This 20 song compilation is part one of that original two record set. It is likely drawn from the same master copies provided to K-TEL as their source for the original release. The original K-TEL recordings were not the highest standard of quality for record pressings in 1975 but much of this is due to the fact that they were jamming ten songs per record side. These recordings are not re-mastered from first generation tapes and many of the songs originally recorded in real stereo are released here in monaural or electronically reprocessed stereo."
4,Refreshing and amazing,"Until very recently, the vintage Molam pop was not part of my musical expertise... You know, being aware about what is happening in the worldwide musical past, present and future is an impossible task! It is something build on a daily basis, based on luck, network and patience! Anyway, the Molam sound, traditional or revisited, is something so intense and impossible to get out of one's head, when discovered... Try this compilation it is really worth spending some of your time."
1,=(,"one of the worst racing games ever made. real recomended age- 99-100...if your that old, you won't notice the bad parts of the game, and won't even know ur playing it!"
2,don't waist your money,I bought two of these I swam 5 times a week the first week it was great then it started stretching a lot after a month it was see through so don't waist your money on this buy the endurance ones.
5,Musical Preserves,"Harvey Mason is one of the greatest musical minds on the planet. As a percussionist, he is without a doubt, the best. His precision, style, and energy are unmatched. The aspiring percussionist who may not have heard of Mr. Mason, has a lot to learn. Funk in A Mason Jar is classic 70's music at it best. Set it Free is a dynamic arrangement. Bob James obviously can not seperate from Harvey (Foreplay). Phantasia is the drummer's delight, with Harvey cuttin' loose. Get this project. It should be in every music lovers stack."
5,Funk in a Mason Jar,A great item and the service was great! I'm very pleased with the speed and care of my purchase. I highly recommend this for anyone who loves the unique sound of the 70s..
2,Doesn't make the grade,"Harvey Mason is a drumkit wizard. A ubiquitous presence in the music industry for the past 40 some odd years his mark has been left on more records than you'd care to count.With an alluring title like ""Funk in a Mason Jar"" this one has always been on my radar but never readily avaiable.Thanks to a new Japanese pressing it's here again.But it should either be left alone or sent to a museum somewhere for archiving. If listless disco-funk and poppy soul is your thing and you were sporting an afro or mullett 30 years ago and wanna revisit old haunts, then go for it. If you're a crate-digger type, don't be fooled by titles. Funk in a Mason Jar is, at it's best high-minded disco and at it's worst low-brow funk and even lower as jazz.Save your money - there's a reason this one was out of print for 20 years."
2,Mediocre at best,"A nice read, quick page turner, but not much to tax the mind. Most of the characters are pretty stereotypical and the plot is rather simple. Kind of similar to reading a formula book: poor woman is taken in by rich lonely woman who wants a daughter and finds that she is needed by SOMEONE and with the help of God saves another soul. I too look forward to Mr. Morris' next book since this may have been his test first novel, and hopefully he has read other Southern writers such as Faulkner for reaching below the surface and finding some depth to his story."
2,BEWARE of buying this book,"In this debut novel I was drawn into the story because of its honesty, its character development and its subject. However, it becomes obvious that this is an initial work for this author by his predictablity and his inaccuracies in the very difficult task of writing in a woman's voice. But the truly annoying part of the book comes after 3/4 of the novel when the main character ""accepts Jesus into my heart"" and attains direction, the light, and salvation. Too much! If you are a Christian you will see this book as powerful and very satisfying, but no where on the fly leaf or the back cover does it say it is of this genre. I felt ripped off and betrayed. If I had read SOMEWHERE that it is a Christian book I would have thought: ""sounds interesting, but not for me"" and I would not have bought it. So, if you are a Christian you should definitely give this book a second look, if you are not then you may be offended by its directions and its outcome."
1,I Disagree,"Poorly written and with a tired plot, ""A Place Called Wiregrass"" reads like a rejected episode of ""Touched by an Angel."" The characters are flat, the dialect obnoxious and unbelievable, and the religious elements grafted on like a necessary but unconvincing afterthought."
3,Unique read,"The book itself was good - no doubt about that. It was well written, the characters were almost realistic, the whole deal. The fact that it was a story written from the perspective of a woman yet actually written by a man just sorta weirded me out. I couldn't really relate to the book because basically in the book every man was a bad guy. Almost. Every man in the novel (with the exception of the ugly pastor at the reject church) let Erma Lee down somehow. Husband, father, son-in-law, pastor of rich church, even the guy she was dating let her down! Somehow I just didn't really didn't get into this novel. I dunno."
3,Really not so good album,"This is typical pre-grand success REM album: full of mediocre songs. Only two hit songs are great (It is the end of the world as we know it and The one I love). Although I am big REM fan I wonder how people here can give five stars to this album. There are so much better album from the band, IMHO Up is their best album without any mediocre songs. And Document is fine too."
5,Their finest hour,"Ranks right up there with U2's ""Achtung, Baby"" and Led Zeppelin's ""IV"" as a historic album and one of rock's greatest examples. Every song on here is strong--with funky rhythms, ingenious songwriting, catchy (but often deep) vocals, gorgeous ballads, and perfeclty-placed touches like horns and keyboards. A breakthrough for REM and a cherished musical masterpiece for the rest of the world. What more can I say? Most R.E.M. albums are excellent. This one's perfect."
5,Pioneers of Alternative Rock / Great Album,"REM truly are the pioneers of alternative music this album came out in 1987 at time when hair metal bands ruled the airwaves. It brought something creative and different than the usual sex innuendo songs on the radio. It is a very political conscious album. The whole CD rocks with stand out tracks like the classic End of the World ( I feel fine). Welcome to the Occupation, Finest Worksong, The One I Love which is one of my fave songs of all time. The whole CD is appealing and essential to anyone who grew up in 80's college radio. This album somewhat brought them into the mainstream but not in a bad way. In my opinion their best album."
4,Yet another solid 80's REM album,"This album, whilst far from catapulting them into mega-stardom, gave REM their first big hits. The first is 'The One I Love': this is a classic love song which is quite painful and hurt inside. The other is the polar opposite 'It's The End of the World As We Know It'. This too is a classic, but in a fun, jump-about kind of way. Stipe sings at 100 mph, and this was the first pop song I ever liked.Also worthy of mention is the strong opener 'Finest Worksong', which is pleasingly political and a strong lyric, and 'Oddfellows Local 151', one of the rockiest tracks on the album, though there was nothing to match its predecessor's opener 'Begin The Begin' as a perfect rock song, complete with top riffs and all. Generally this album is not quite as brilliant as several REM other albums, including Life's Rich Pageant, but contains some great songs and is worth owning all the same."
5,A classic in 5.1 surround! Document as you've never heard it.,"This album is absolutely in my top 3 favorite REM albums. The DualDisc is great with the three music videos. Also, if you have a home theater, you can enjoy this in 5.1 surround sound. The mix is fantastic. Document is like you've never heard it before. The 5.1 mix is available as Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS 5.1 for regular DVD-Video players. If you have a DVD-Audio player, there is also a high-resolution surround and stereo track.Well worth the money. Bring on the surround sound mixes for more of the early REM albums!"
4,Strong Set From R.E.M.,"This album has some of R.E.M.'s greatest music. It is brilliant up through ""The One I Love,"" then falls down a bit on the last few selections, such as the boring ""Lightning Hopkins."" Still, a very worthy collection from one of the modern rock era's most influential bands. This was their last release on I.R.S. records before they made the big jump to Warner Brothers."
1,Stuipd,I would like to see if penny stocks and bonds are not a very famous church of Santa Barbara and I think that you feel like a very famous person
3,Quite used...,"Although I knew the product was second-hand, I thought it would be in better condition. What I did not like was that the prior owner had highlighted parts of the book, and this diverts one's attention when reading it. Otherwise, it was ok,given the fact that it is a used item."
4,Good system for kids,"This is a good gaming system, but probably more suited for kids. Sony seems to dominate the teen and young adult market, and most of the title's I've seen for N64 lately are kid centered. Think Pokemon."
5,Best System Ever!!,Nintendo 64 is the best system. I enjoy the games and the system as well. The fun colors that nintendo put out like this watermelon one are truly collectors items now. Have fun!!
3,So-so version in antiquated language,"This is precisely the kind of classical adaptation that turns kids off. It's not as bad as some, but as a Classicist myself, I fail to see why Odysseus and Achilles have to sound like Victorian twits. Then again, it is one of a very few versions of Homer's stories that are accessible to younger readers."
4,MJ table cover,"Although it is rather plain, the color is pleasant, the backing is very good, the fabric is nice and thick. All in all, a very good buy if you're playing Mahjongg on table surfaces that could scratch from the tiles. I recommend it!"
4,Table Cover works really well,Cover works really well. Even though it comes rolled up it sat flat on the table. My in-laws were also impressed with it and they are very frequent Mah-Jong players - they own a dedicated MJ table.
4,Great product,I have been looking for something like this for a long time. It is made of high quality material and can be washed when it is dirty. A good buy. At last no more wasting money on mahjong papers.
4,Very nice pasta set,"I bought this as a Christmas present for a dear friend of mine who recently began collecting rooster objects.The entire set arrived in perfect condition. The colors, red & black are vibrant and striking..the rooster pattern is on each piece and is very nice.Very good quality, good size and good price...will make a perfect holiday gift for serving pasta or stew or salad or whatever."
1,SHIPPING STINKS!!,"I ordered this item as a gift, it is not packaged properly and several peices were broken- returned for more broken dishes...needless to say I wouldn't recommend ordering this product from Amazon. They will come broken! (HOWEVER- I did like the dishes & the pattern was nice -wished I could find them in a store somewhere)"
1,Dishes not packed well; broken,"I'm glad some of you received these dishes not broken in a million pieces! Amazon or whoever is packaging these needs to learn how to properly pack. There was no bubble wrap or popcorn at all - just flimsy sheets of cardboard!! Duh?? I've sent them back twice now and third time won't be a ""charm"" for me, 'cause I won't go through this again. NEVER will I ever order breakables from Amazon again. The headache was not worth it - even if the dishes are nice and pretty."
3,Great Book but Bad Ending,"This is a great book. I got it from my school library because it caught my eye. I started reading and I loved it. It starts out with Peer at his father's funeral where his uncle comes to take him. He takes him to his mill on the foot of Troll Fell to live with his twin Grim. They are very cruel to him. Peer then makes friends with Hilde, a girl at a nearby farm who's father went away on a viking ship. Peer thinks his uncle's are being cruel to him but then he discovers a much more sinister plot: to sell him and Hilde to the trolls for troll gold for the gaffer of troll fell's wedding, which are abundant in the area. This book is full of twists and turns, up until the last part of the second to last chapter. I won't spoil anything, but all I can tell you is that it's very childish and Katherine Langrish wanted a really happy ending to please children, but she made it too childish"
2,Mint Julep Murder,"This book was rated as very good and good dust cover. The dust cover is torn at the bottom. The pages are very good but the edges are discolored, brown."
1,Never again,"I never received this book from Amazon. Evidentally it was lost in the mail, and I am not happy baout ir. From now on, I will drive to the nearest bookstore at the mall before I order through the mail again. All it takes is one screw up, and I quit."
1,Quagmire of horse feathers,"Many times I said it: female authors suck. So does Carolyn Hart with her ""Death on Command"" baloney. I first found out that my gender cannot write, when I followed Oprah's Book Club. All female authors are beneath mediocricity. What a bunch of literary losers! Then she picked a book ""House of Sand and Fog"" by a male author. I loved it and promptly was made into a movie. Carolyn Hart I thought had talent when I read one of her short stories. Mint Julep is a disaster. I made two attempts to read it, landet on page 50 and still find myself in a quagmire of boredom. No logic, no story line, just horse feathers."
4,Loved them but had an issue,"I had bought a pair of these at a discount shoe store in size 11, fell in love with them,, the 11's were just slightly too big, and of course they don't make a 10 1/2, thought I would try the size 10, they fit better but where all the materials joined, they rubbed on my little toe. Unfortunately I will be sending them back. I recently bought another pair in 10 wide and the did the trick."
5,One of the better S&M novels.,"This wasn't too hardcore or disturbing, but intensely erotic nonetheless. If you are a fan of this genre, you will love this book. The characters are likeable, and the writing is good as well. I couldn't find anything wrong with this book, except that it wasn't long enough."
1,AWFUL,"I've read this author before, unfortunately I forgot and read her again. She has absolutely no understanding of BDSM and simply glorifies (and not very well) abusive relationships. I'd hate for anyone to think that this ridiculous and poorly written book is what dominance and submission is all about."
5,Quite a compelling story!,"Review by Vickie Lake: Although I purchased this book three years ago and it is one of my favorites, I have not reviewed it. A surprising lack! It is Corum's best one. Though I have read others of hers they cannot match the intensity, the vibrancy and completely recognizable dizzying extremes of love and sexual attraction. Just pulled it from my A+++ shelf and find rereading it as thoroughly exciting as ever."
5,Breathtaking submission into another realm,"This book was absolutely incredible, I could not put it down. Moment to moment I had similar flashes into my own life and deeply planted issues. The author portrayed a road that many of us do not dare go down. By the time you finish this book you will ask yourself why you haven't gone down this path, is it really the social fear of what others might think or is it due to the fear of losing oneself in the submission to another. Absolutely incredible, hot, steamy, thought-provoking book."
1,A WASTE OF TIME,My eight year old spent about 10 minutes with this and walked away.No educational value at all. Just press in the right position to flip the spiderman. How many times does a child want to do that?
3,Body Heat Blu-ray Volume too loud then too low,"Love this movie; the picture was great. However, the volume kept changing frequently so had to adjust every few minutes. You have to keep your hands on the remote so everyone doesn't get blasted out of the room, then you have to up the volume so you can hear it. This is extremely irritating and annoying!"
5,Most Excellent,THis is an excellent movie. It looks wonderful on Blu-ray too. I've seen this movie many times and never get tired of it. Worthwhile purchase to any collection. They don't make them like this anymore. The special features are fantastic!
1,Body Heat,VERY VERY disappointed in product...Why would I purchase a DVD to work in Pennsylvania that can only be used in EUROPE!!!!!!! When I complained to the company they stated that it was listed that way!! Funny I didn't see it....They will not exchange and I can only reorder once I return the DVD...Shipping is not covered....Needless to say I will NEVER order from them again...Amazon however is FANTASTIC!!!! Be cautious of this company being listed on Amazon website...they will only bring you down...thanks...anne navarra rn
1,Beware!,"Don't get me wrong because I love this movie but I got it with a few extras that I didn't expect. First I thought it was a little tacky that there was a price tag on the DVD that was $3 less then what I paid for it. Paying a little extra money wasn't what really made me mad because I still got a pretty good deal for the DVD, what made me angry was the fact that the DVD arrived with little insects crawling on it! I think that the DVD came from a warehouse in Illinois so watch out! My package arrived sealed with my DVD and compementary insects inside."
5,Great Early 80's Film - Before PG 13!,"This film as you can see from the reviews here is a bit of a gem.Its a great period piece in more ways than one. Its from an era when an R Rating meant something. If you want how times have changes and what that hybrid ""PG-13"" rating has done to de-sex and water down grown-up movies just watch this movie. Back then flims were G, PG, R, or X - the 14-17 year old demo was not driving the studios.Its a steamy movie, Kathleen Turner is really great, and if you look close yon can catch a bit of her natural ""shrub"" at one point - its a little bonus."
4,"It's great, and Kathleen Turner's beauty's at her best!!!!.","How could William Hurt refuse an invitation to spend the night with such a spectacular and young Kathleen Turner at her wonderful house, and on such a warm night?... Bet no real man would. But there are limits that can't ever be tresspassed, which is exactly what Hurt does, and that wrong decision makes him pay an extremely high price afterwards."
5,Zowie,"This classic example of film noir is the one. Lawrence Kasdan scored big in this one, his directorial debut. Kathleen Turner plays a spider spinning a very complex web of deceit, and William Hurt plays a Florida lawyer led astray by desire, sex, steam heat, and the sneakiest plot of duplicity you could possibly imagine. Released in 1981, the movie caused quite an uproar with its sex scenes; the pairing of Hurt and Turner turned out to be cinema magic.Be sure to watch it with someone you want to spend the night with."
2,Blu-ray audio missing surround,While the picture is better than the DVD the sound is missing the surround channels. It claims to be 5.1 and the surround channels are there. But at no time is there even a hint of something on them. False advertising. This is Dolby Stero at best.
1,Don&#65533;t Buy This Title; It&#65533;s Defective!,"Please note that while this DVD claims to be both widescreen and pan & scan, the wide screen version is not letterboxed, but somewhat ""squished"" and ends up looking a whole lot like the pan & scan version. Frankly, I can't tell the difference between the widescreen side and the pan & scan side. If you're a true movie aficionado, don't buy this title until Warner Bros remasters it correctly. If you just want to watch the movie and don't care about picture quality, then go ahead and buy it. But you've been warned. (I sent my copy back for a refund!)"
3,The movie is hot. The DVD is not.,"The movie is extremely enjoyable. Kathleen Turner and William Hurt give very good performances. Things are indeed hot in this movie.Whilst some elements are derivative of Hitchcock and some are predictable, it is enjoyable to see how they play out.The DVD is a disappointment. The casing is cardboard, not the hard plastic that better withstands time and usage. The widescreen version is a matted version that crops content off the top and bottom and does not appear to offer any more on the sides than the full screen version. The added content is OK."
5,I Beg to Differ....the DVD is Groovy,"Just to set the record straight, the video quality on this DVD is very good. All of us video-philes would prefer the letterbox over the anamorphic--but hey, it's a bargain, and the quality is quite good."
5,Great Noveau Film Noir film,"Great Movie. Very sensual, easy to see how a hound dog gets used by a very smart, calculating woman. Highly recommended."
4,Great Twist,"With this tremendous cast, you can't go wrong. Yes, a bit of the plot was telegraphed early on, but there is ample suspense and a great twist that makes the film fun and worthwhile. Recommended"
1,Won't play in our DVR,The movie is great or I wouldn't have ordered it...one of the classics....but it was ordered from Europe and must be encoded for European systems only. Thus we cannot view it. Any suggestions would be appreciated.
5,AMAZING!,"Mae's sophomore album ""The Everglow"" is a masterpiece....from track one to the end, every song is amazingly done, catchy as heck, and never gets old....the piano is amazing, and gets you very relaxed, very quick....best tracks: EVERY SONG!....amazing i cannot say it enough...go buy this NOOOWWWW"
5,Awesome.,"I think that this album is worth more in one complete listen through than the individual tracks are. That's not taking anything away from any track, they're all great. But the theme of this cd is to take the listener on a ride and experience everything in between the first and last track - which is The Everglow. Even on the more emotional songs that deal with heavier topics, Dave Elkins, the lead singer of Mae, doesn't mind staying focused on the bright side of things; that's a welcomed change of pace in my music collection."
5,Very deserved follow up to Destination Beautiful,I liked the Destination Beautiful CD very much. I was a little tired after a while but then came the Everglow. I listened to it and was definitely impressed. The singer comes out clear.I like the Prologue and Epilogue. Its pretty cool/cute. haha
5,SO GOOD!!!,"omg,this cd is such a awesome experience!!they have such meaning in their music!!buy it right away!!!"
3,it so different,"this is a good cd at the beginning but them i think and this is just my opinion so people dont have to write a review just to yell at me because i have my right to an opinion so deal withit,it realy starts to lose its touch but it starts ok.p.s if we were rating on artwork this would get 5 stars."
2,A little disappointing,"I bought this album after I'd spent some time listening to some of the songs on [...] and read a review about the concept of the album, which initially attracted me to it.Since listening to it, I can't see me ever buying another concept album. The artistry on this album seems to take a back seat to the 'story' which gives the whole thing the feeling of being overly contrived. I also had a problem with the different personalities expressed in the music, it seemed like the thread that linked all the songs together was the concept and, nothing else. There's definitely a style that is inherent across the album, but it's not strong enough for my liking.Individually, there are some great songs on this album. 'Everglow', 'Suspension', 'Anything', and 'Someone Else's Arms' are all pretty good songs, and if you're a patient person, these along with a few others maybe even make it worth the purchase... but not for me."
3,It's Okay,"I was definately expecting more from this band, since Destination: Beautiful is one of my favorite CDs. While this CD isn't terrible, it is a bit of a let down. They lost some of their unique sound, which was what made their first CD so good."
2,Generic Pop/Emo,"It's probably a masterpiece as far as Christian rock goes, but how much does that really say? Nothing special about this album. A few catchy songs but exactly what you would expect from an emo/pop band."
2,ehh,"ehh this cd has alot of hype but not to much game. there are about for songs on this cd that are realy standout. but there are about 8 tHAT ARE JUST GIONG TO POSER town. first off i will say that the epilogue and proplogue are pethetic. ""open the book that goes along with this cd to realy complete your experiance"". what is that c'mon this is a cd we want to hears song not some ladie with myctical music found in a wizard video game. people theres no ""experiance with this cd"" half the time you dont even no what the vocals mean.al though alot of this cd sucks a little bit is excellent. such as the everglow, someone else's arms and ready and waiting to fall. i think the everglow sounds alot like the smashing pumkins old lead singer on the melie collie and the infanent sadness cd. now that cd is a good mysticle beutiful cd. this one is just trying to make them sound realy beautiful. And this is sad because destination beutiful was a sweet cd. i dont know just not that good, better luck next time mae"
5,"Don't listen to other peoples reviews, this is a good one","On the first day of a cd release there are always a few people who don't really liek a band (such as mae) in the beginning and just go on a webstie (liek cdnow.com) to rip it so no one buys it. I disagree with those people. As soon as i opened up the cd and put it in my girlfriends cd player and i knew it was gold. now this is just the first listen of this cd but i think it has certainly grabbed my attention. i haven't heard such a good cd, right when i opened it, in a very very long time. If you liked Mae, Desination: Beautiful, or Destination: B-Sides, you will lvoe thise cd. It is a lot of the same stuff, but different, and much much better. I would STRONGLY recommend this to anyone. it is a hit"
3,Fails to beat their first album,"With their sophmore release ""The Everglow"" Mae has reduced themselves to nothing more then just another mainstream pop rock band as they stray away from their roots. Their first cd could be compared to the likes of amazing bands like Death Cab for Cutie and Coheed and Cambria but with this new mediocre release they degrade themselves by being just another pop/rock band. I like alot of the stuff taht Tooth and Nail puts out but they have a handful of bands that just won't make it such as Thousand Foot Krutch, Project 86, and now Mae. A sad downfall for a band with much potential."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,"I BOUGHT THIS CD FOR MY SON - WE ARE SEARCHING FOR GOOD R&B / RAP WITH A POSITIVE MESSAGE - WE WERE VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS CD - THE RECORDING QUALITY WAS LACKING, THE BEATS VERY REPETITIVE AND UNINSPIRING, YOU COULD HARDLY HEAR THE WORDS - OVERALL - WE ARE LISTING THIS CD FOR SALE AND WE JUST BOUGHT IT YESTERDAY! MY HUSBAND, SON AND I ALL AGREED WITHIN TEN MINUTES THAT THIS CD WAS NOT A WINNER."
5,Hip Hop,Hip hop at it best! Sup the Chemist is a dope rhymer and this album will destroy the neighborhood with all that bass blasting from the trunk!
3,Not as straightford as i like from Sup,"Sup The Chemist * Dust (Beesyde Records/UpRok, 2000)With influences that range from THE DOORS and MICHAEL JACKSON to SADE and JOHN COLTRANE, Chris Cooper reappears with another collection of mind jams. Like a Saved CHUCK D or KRS 1, Sup is not satisfied with just giving his people anything ordinary on his discs. As when he was known as the leader of the pioneering Rap group, SFC, Sup the Chemist continues to offer lyrics that will ""suplex your mind"".For fans of: Peace 586/ LPG/ AHMADPositive Beat DigestLaZeric Fridell Freeman"
5,Artistically represent thyself,and that is exactly what Sup did on this cd. i havent heard anything else from sup except the couple of verses on DJ Dove's cd. but this cd is definitely the truth. if you are open to new and refreshing forms of HIP HOP (Christian and secular) then you need to get this. i've owned it since it came out and it stays in heavy rotation in the Dodge. WARNING: if you are big into anything mainstream then you probably wont feel it.
1,Neo-nazi propaganda,"I would have preferred to give this 0 stars. This book is not only pro-Nazi, but it is so poorly written that University Press of America, usually reputable, should be ashamed to have handles this one. It is purely vanity press. I am embarassed that my university bought a copy. Everything is colored from an anti-American point of view."
2,A game without lift.,I have been enjoying the ace combat series for sometime now. But this one leaves alot to be desired. The mission briefs were dull and very uninspired. The missions themselves were very similar. It didn't take long before one mission seemed the same as the next. The aircraft designs were very cool and that was the best part of the game. Some of them were nigh brilliant. Although most of them were enemy aircraft.I finished the game in around 3 hours which makes its lasting appeal minimal. I am waiting to see what they are going to do on the PS2.If you played the others then give it a play. It's still an okay way to spend a couple of hours.
3,Take to the skies,"Ace Combat 3: Electrosphere - Circa 1999GOOD:- Fun and unique missions (especially later on in the game)- Lot's of planes to unlockBAD:- Graphics may looked dated, to today video game players- Controls can be tough- Learning curve is high- Story is a little on the dry sideIF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:- Arcade type jet fighter game with some simulation elementsGAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- Air Combat- Ace Combat 2ADDITIONAL NOTES:- All of the planes are real ones, or based on the concepts of future ones"
4,oldie but goody,It have some good old songs on there that my wife really enjoy it also make you think back about the way holidays use to be back in the good old days.
3,"Disappointed that it is missing 4 songs, but his voice is still like velvet in these ballads!","I have listened to Nat King Cole Christmas music since I was a kid. I had the cassette tape of The Christmas Song, and it finally died. I thought I was replacing it with the same cd version, but the cd lacks 4 upbeat songs that the tape has, including ""I Saw Three Ships,"" ""Joy To The World,"" and ""Caroling, Caroling."" This cd only has 10 slow Christmas ballads, which are great, but I love the 4 others that it lacks."
1,Terrible. The product sent was NOT what I ordered!!!!!!!,"I opened this CD on Christmas morning to find that inside the Christmas Song CD case, wrapped in cellophane, was a CD called Barrage. Needless to say, the entire family was disappointed because the Nat King Cole CD had been a tradition for our family but I was especially distressed at what appears to have been fraud either on the part of Amazon or the seller that Amazon represented!!!"
2,The Christmas Song,"Nat King Cole put many verbal inserts into CD, Not as good as I would have expected."
3,The Christmas Song,"Vast majority of the songs were superb, however, I was bothered by the ""Toys for Tots"" song near the end of the track-----while Toys for Tots is an excellent program, singing about it-----and the U. S. Marines----doesn't ""fit"" with the Christmas spirit IMHO."
4,A Fireplace of Warmth,Cuddle up with eggnog and place another log in the fireplace while you prepare to listen to the warm sounds of this music. Relaxing and content song after song will bring you to a Christmas cheer.
5,Nat King Cole CD,"I am so glad I finally found this CD. You see this is a second copy for me. I took our original copy to work during the Christmas in July and it went missing from the case. Of course, first I searched all of our local stores, but they did not carry it anymore. The process to order was easy, and it arrived quickly. My husband was so suprised (and pleased). He did not know I was trying to replace it. Thank you."
1,A grotesque collection,"Whenever I hear this collection of Christmas songs, any joy that may have been within me suddenly leaves me and I feel a deathly heaviness. From the eponymous mawkish opener onwards, nothing could be more emblematic of the deadening, empty side of Christmas. ""Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe / Help to make the season bright"" croons Nat in his syrupy voice. How romantic is a slab of dead beast? Another real highlight is the near-hysterical fakeness of 'Come All Ye Faithful', with its film-music style backing chorus. By the time we reach 'The Happiest Christmas Tree', a truly moronic ditty, any sane person will be reaching for the carpet cutter. Don't do it, folks."
3,Heatwarming Christmas tale of love and loss......,"The Angel Doll is a nice story of 2 little boys who deliver newspapers. One of the boys (Whitey) is saving money to buy an angel doll for his sick sister. My favorite aspect of the book is the theme of love shown by the characters like Whitey, Mrs.Barnes, and others. It is a nice little story that can be read year round with a heartwarming end involving angel dolls."
2,Not as good since the product changed,"Like others have said, sometime in the past year or more, the formula for this product changed, and it's no longer as effective as used to be. The consistency is thinner and the the scrubbing action isn't as intense. For $30 a bottle, it's sadly not worth it. This used to be a great product, but now I will look for a replacement."
3,should have listened to the warnings,"I needed to start using a face scrub regularly and decided to go with this one as it had great reviews and I've been happy with other Menscience products I've used in the past. I did notice all the recent reviews were negative, specifically pointing out a change in formula that reduced the scrubbing action. But I decided to roll the dice anyways given the longer history of very positive reviews.The scrub feels great for the first few seconds... but then the scrubbing beads breakdown and completely disappear, and it feels like a regular lotion/facewash as someone else mentioned. You can squeeze more out of the tube but the beads will dissolve just as fast. It's amazing when it works, and if it lasted I can see why the past reviews were so overwhelmingly favorable. But for the length of effectiveness it isn't worth the cost at any price (and especially at this price point)."
1,This product could be old,"Even though the seller is the manufacturer, it would not stand behind the freshness of the product shipped by providing the product manufacturing date.This very expensive product loses efficacy when old.And if manufacturer hides the product freshness, what else are they hiding from me? A bad ingredient? This stuff goes on my skin, I simply can't trust them."
4,"great product, but don't forget the sunscreen","First of all, I'm not a dermatologist, I'm just a heterosexual guy with sensitive skin who has tried many products and done a lot of research in the search of the right products. I offer reviews of Clinique, zirh, menscience, art of shaving and baxter of California, hope my reviews are helpful.this product is a great scrub, it really makes a difference on the skin. My skin feels very smooth and bright (not shiny). the downside is that you have to use a sun screen while using this product or you'll get a huge skin burn. Nothing major, but it's a bit annoying knowing that you have to use it. I only scrub once a week because of this"
1,Not what it used to be,"As mentioned in some recent reviews, this face scrub is no longer what it used to be. The new formula they are using is terrible and no longer does the excellent job it used to. The beads are too small/fine. I have used this scrub for years because it was the absolute best. I will no longer be purchasing it nor can I recommend it."
3,decent face wash atleast for me.,I have oily skin and this cleanses nicely but there are other products I have tried that are better .
4,samurai x was great,"The samurai X ova was truly amazing.Part of samurai X takes place before rurouni kenshin( before kenshin became a wanderer). If u liked the happy cheery, comical mood of rurouni kenshin samurai is very different from that. Although there is one rurouni kenshin movie called ""Samurai x THE MOTION PICTURE"" the second part of samurai X is about years after rurouni kenshin. This is also a great price to have all these dvds for a good price. If you are anaultimate fan of rurouni kenshin you should definitly buy this"
5,one that is WORTH YOUR WHILE to get,"Samurai X OVA is by far my favorite anime of all time. And that's saying a lot, cause I live and breathe anime. It keeps you holding your breath to the very last second. I have to admit, I bawled like a baby during each episode. Just seeing the true devotion, the true passion, the true LOVE... there's no other anime that can even compare..."
4,Gotta See This,"Although a rather sudden change in animation style from the much more light-hearted Rurouni Kenshin series by AnimeWorks, Samurai X is a wonderful collection of stories about the red-headed hero in his years both preceding and following the AnimeWorks series. The characters and their relationships are more developed than in the television series and the stories are allowed more time to dwell on the viewer, creating a much grimmer and almost dreary atmosphere. As a lover of guts and blood, my chief reason for liking this animation beyond the remarkable level of sheer love and respect that the makers' hold for Rurouni Kenshin, is the fight scenes and the scenery. It has been lovingly created. A ""Gotta See This""."
3,Not A Good Ending,"The art and depth of Trust & Betrayal are stunning, a true masterpiece. But I could not stand to watch Reflections. I own & have watched all 3 of the box sets from the series. Watching Reflections seemed to ruin Trust & Betrayal and the entire series. The characters in Reflections act nothing like they did in the series-it was like watching lookalikes try to replace the original characters. Kenshin's Group deserves better than how they are portrayed in Reflections."
5,It was awesome,"Two thumbs up. I love the manga, series, and the movies. If you love anime this a good one to get into."
5,DVD-RW,Came in a timely fashion. What I was looking for. I would recommend this dealer for anyone looking for this product.
3,Sony 3DMW30 8CM DVD-RW Discs,I have not had time to really use my new camera & discs much due to illness. I am now using my first and so far it seems to be wokring fine.Pete Filiatrault
1,Not a Prayer,What a waste of a great premise. This subject is begging for a good satircal novel. This isn't it.
5,Wanderer's Necklace Review,"I thought this free book was going to be a dud. Boy was I wrong. Olaf the main character really has some extraordinary adventures. It was rather amusing to read the insults levied at the Greeks, Muslims, black women with greasy hair, and a few others. However the best one occurred toward the end when the Muslim Arab pointed out if he would follow their faith he could marry both girls. Is that how Muslim men think???? (Must be fiction) Anyway I could not put the book down until I finished it. I highly reccomend this book for a Kindle download."
2,Boring saga,I read this book for my book club. The description sounded interesting but I found the story to be flat. It had potential to be engaging but the main character was under developed. I found that I didn't really care about his outcome. Don't waste your time.
3,The Wanderer's Necklace.,"For a old style book it was first hard to get into, but when you read it at small sections of a time you should be able to eventually get into a story of a child who through his life eventually found love and a place to be happy."
3,Good trash horror film,Delivers light-hearted horror/gore fare. Good banter with a battle-of-the-sexes motif between Chucky and his Missus; and an added random element from their androgynous offspring.
3,Worth Watching,"This maybe not worth buying unless you are a hardcore Chucky fan, I thought Bride of Chucky was much better. This movie just does not flow as nicely as it should have, alot of weird unnecessary ""plot"" twists that were just dumb - I could have handled a little more killing too. If you get it, get the unrated version at least - but I recommend you rent it before you buy it."
5,How many more?,"Yet another Chucky movie. How long are they going to drag this series out? Just because i am saying this doesn't mean i not going to see it, i love the chucky movies. The best was ""Bride of Chucky"". Now that we have another character to the killing spree it ought to be good. And a son!"
5,GETTING OLD,"Well Chuckie is getting a little old now. I mean Child's Play came out in 1988. I don't like how they are bringing back all these horror, killing people. They brung back Jason, Freddy, Alien, Godzilla, and Predator in other movies. I might only see this because of the music. I have heard there will be some good heavy rock/metal in this. It said above that if you enjoyed this you will like ""Volume 3: The Subliminal Verses"" from Slipknot. Sometime they'll bring back King Kong though. I think they should just make one long movie with all the horror, physcpath, obsessed with killing, people. Have one giant fight scene between all of them. Everyone knows the predator would win. Well for this movie I would recommend you see it if you seen all the other ones."
2,Poor excuse for this series.......................,"I expected this movie to be as great as the other Chuckie movies. It starts out that Chuckies kid is working but I won't say what he does it's kind of a surprise. This movie starts out great but, they could've made it a lot creepier. The story line was poor, and it really didn't seem to have a plot. It was almost boring at times. What happened to this great series?"
5,Best one yet....,"I decided to see it to see what it was like and it was way better then i expected. I like this one becuase it's really funny. It made me laugh over and over. Not that many killings and if they do there usually funny. In this one Tiffany and Chucky come back to find out they have a little boy. This little boy is sweet, innocent, and hates that there parents kill so Tiffany makes a pac with Chucky to stop killing for good. Do they finally stop? Also Chucky and Tiffany don't know what there kid is... a boy or a girl? what do you think? Jenifer Tilly plays the voice od Tiffany and she plays herself, a actress.The dolls looks better becuase they get a makeover. It's really funny and I liked it."
4,Chucky Gone Comedy,"All of the horror that the series had has finally been sucked dry by this film, but it has all been replaced with comedy and I liked it. This movie is just a joke on the horror genre and it is funny! Murderous Chucky is really conflicted when he finds out he has a kid, and even worse is the fact that Glen (or Glenda?) doesn't know what sex it is since he/she wasn't born with either gender. What a brilliant choice of name for Chucky's kid with gender issues since it's name (Glen or Glenda) is a tribute to the Ed Wood film of the same name about a transgender man. Overall, a pretty funny movie that can be enjoyed if you aren't expecting horror but more of what was seen on Bride of Chucky. The difference is, I actually liked this movie more than the one before it"
4,"A very different, but good sequel","Seed of Chucky, the fifth entry in the Child's Play series is probably the most amusing sequel to Child's Play. The Seed of Chucky is more a dark comedy than a serious horror film. Chucky and Tiffany's ""seed"" looks like David Bowie from his Ziggy Stardust era, and is also gender confused Glen/Glenda. Glen/Glenda does not want to follow in his/her parents footsteps and murder people. While Chucky and Tiffany still want to find human bodies to transfer their souls into. I had grown tired of the Child's Play series, but I actually found Seed of Chucky to be quite entertaining when compared to Child's Play 2 or 3."
1,I was expecting a good movie,"This movie blows. if you are expecting chucky in all his glory forget it! Child's Play's franchise is gone! Forever! This movie is even worse than the last installsment! COME ON! Whats wrong with people? They made this cheap ""sequel"" because they wanted to make money. its so offensive!There isnt even a plot. Chucky and his silly bride are in hollywood somehow. The ""humor"" fact is st*pid. If you find the scene funny where Chucky is masturbat*ng, im sorry but you are sick. thats not even laughable. there is no gore in this movie. Now then there comes the boy. remember chucky's kid that was born at the end of Bride of Chucky? he is here in this movie. but guess what? no sharp teeth, is not even scary! and to top it all the boy doesnt know if he is a female or a male. bad scripted, bad acting! waste of money.I dont think ill be seeing chucky for awhile. is not an horror movie anymore, is just the cheapest ""comedy"" out there. avoid this at all cost! dont waste your money."
1,Words cannot describe how bad this really is,"I love horror movies. I love B-rate movies. I really love bad movies. I thought there was no limit to what I could watch. I was wrong.This is without a doubt the stupidest, most ill-conceived excuse for a movie anyone anywhere has ever come up with. I stayed faithful to Chucky through all his movies, but this was embarrassingly bad. Even Jennifer Tilly who was sexy in the 'Bride of Chucky' is now a fat joke and cliche of herself.You really got to put your mind in neutral for this. First you have to see that this movie is about the making of the next Chucky movie. Then you have to let it go that the two monster dolls can actually conceive offspring. Then finally you just accept that the 'seed of Chucky' is ugly enough to make Chucky himself look cute. To top it off, he also has gender issues. You couldn't pay me to watch this again."
1,Very disappointing!,"This film is an embarrasment to all the other Child's Play films. Yeah it had some funny moments but overall it is a huge disappointment. Whatever happened to the days when Chucky was somewhat scary? Why do the writers insist on Chucky having a family and being a daddy! Thats not what made him so great to begin with. Don't get me wrong I am a big Child's Play fan, but they keep on taking these characters in the wrong direction! I hope that they go back to the storyline of the first three child's play films when they develop the 6th installment of this series. Please rent this film FIRST before buying! Beware!"
3,haven't seen it yet....,but it better be better than the worst chucky movie ever! the bride of chucky. i mean how can you even stay awake to watch it? it's so lame! everybody know's the best one is child's play 1. well i'll be waiting to see this one.
3,Seed of Chucky..!! -I can't weight..!! -I agree with fans,I know I have not seen the film yet. -Yep. -It's kind ofstupid while you review a film you have not seen. -But I'veagree with the other hardcore chuck fan's.. -Like me. -Well.I have the first and fourth one.. -DVD'S..! -Becuase; -I've watched the USA Version's of the other Child's Play.. -Film's..With the extra footage.. -I was dissapointed that their not included on any of their DVD..!But I hope that; -Seed of Chucky.. -Will make sense.. -Be alot better then; -Bride of Chucky.. -I hope that; -FreddyVs. Jason.. -Did not ware out the lackness of these filmwhere the point their not scary any more..!I still can't weight for this two get out..!Dolly Hell.. -come's out on; -October; -22..!!Seed of Chucky..!! -Beware..!!
1,NO STAR AT ALL!!,"What a disgusting movie and an insult to the Chucky series. While Child's Play - 1,2,3 were brilliant, Bride of Chucky(BOC) was on the edge, between good and bad.BOC had to add Jennifer Tilly's oomph because of lack of original ideas to attract the audience... still it had some spectacular murders.this one,SOC, goes right over the edge and sinks to bottom of the bottomless pit of third-rate crudity ! Not even Jennifer Tilly's wonderful body and ""ohhh.."" lovely voice could rescue this movie!"
1,I See Dumb People,"I honestly, in my wildest imagination, just CANNOT see how people actually LIKED Bride of Chucky. That movie was without a doubt the worst abomination of a horror film I have ever seen next to the Blair Witch Project. It was NOTHING like the originals, which were infinately better than the filth BoC was. Since seed of Chucky is following in Bride of Chuckys footsteps, then it seems that this movie is going to be just as bad, if not worse (which would be quite hard to do actually) than Bride of Chucky."
1,No way!,Unbelievable! It's amazing the garbage that passes for entertainment! It's even more amazing that people will pay to see this junk. Do people really watch this stuff? A fifth installment of the Chucky series? You've got to be kidding me! It's a frickin' doll for God sakes! Anyone who goes to the theatre to see this abomination is a sucker with so sense for quality entertainment.
3,way different than all the other movies,"It took me awhile to understand where this movie was going...as far as whether it's a comedy, or a hrror movie - but they make everything into a joke, even the ways people are killed. When I saw this movie, there were young kids in the cinema...they must''ve been around seven. to ten years old...and I was really surprised to hear them laugh when Britney's car exploded.I still say the best Cucky movie is Bride of Chucky."
4,Awesome,"when my kids were little they were terrified of chucky. They are finally old enough to watch it so I order it. Came pretty fast and dvds work great. My only issue is if you haven't seen bride of chucky or seed of chucky in a long time or ever, know that it has quite of bit of sexual content. Although my kids could watch chucky 1, 2, and 3 they are not old enough to see bride and Seed. Parents beware. For chucky 1, 2, and 3 my kids liked them and realized how scary he is not lol."
4,Love Chucky!,I love chucky so when I saw this I knew I had to buy it. They need to come out with another.
2,A little dissapointed.,"Childs play 2 and 3 are classics and the bride of chucky was legit for the new generation they brought to the title but the fact that rogue pictures if i stand correct is a UK film owned industry or most of the films star UK/brittish actors but the fact that they bought out the title for the seed of chucky and they added it to this collection and kept the first one out is beyond me and i thought it was a disappointment as a fan but for the price, i cant be mad but its the principal that im looking at."
4,Nice set,This is a pretty cool looking dvd set of the child's play films. Part 1 is not included because it is owned by MGM and not Universal. My main problems with this set is the fact that the disc for part 2 doesn't have the alternate ending included. Other then it's a great collection for hardcore Chucky fans.
4,Good for a 4th part,"My very favorites are still "" Child's play and Bride of Chucky"" this is not terrible, but it doesn't deliver all that great suspense and humor, their kid is not as evil as they are and the double role of Jennifer Tilly was not a good idea,.. is a good movie, but not great."
4,Good for a Chucky movie,"Besides the normal comedy element, which is great in this one, there is the gore. I think that the one thing the others lacked was gore, and now in this one there is enough to make up for it. The FX guy's death was good, but Redman was the better, and John Waters was AWESOME. Sorry if I spoiled anything for anyone, but you should know that characters with lines are going to die. Can't wait for the next one, and you know there will be a next one."
3,"well, hello dolly!","What is it about dolls and the complete insanity of them coming to life and attacking people that I find so hilarious? I'm not sure. Anyway, I think this is a decent deal for what I got. No, it's not as funny as I remember. But what I most enjoy is watching the actors keep straight faces and laughing to myself about my own fears. Clowns, dolls, ventriloquist's dummies.... I'd try to rent this or borrow it from the library before I'd buy it. But for the price, it's not a big loss."
3,Review from a Die Hard Chucky Fan...Sad to give it 3 stars.,"Ever since I was young, I have had a thing for Chucky. I remember being so excited to see this movie. I was very disappointed about this. Though I gave it 3 stars, I still like it, mainly because I love Chucky, and I could never turn my back on the series. The main reason(s) for dis-liking this film most out of the series is because (1)This is the first Chucky to include nudity within the movie, I think any horror movie can do without nudity, and seeing it in a chucky movie is just not right in my opinion. (2)I hate how Glen is made to appear Japanese, it throws the whole thing off, how could he be Japanese if his parents are both American? and (3)I don't like how Jennifer Tilly acts as both the doll and herself within casting, especially if she was in Bride of Chucky.These are just my thoughts on the film. I love Chucky, but there is a limit. They need more HORROR and less comedy."
3,this is going bto be good for the fans,for the people that are chucky fans and like chucky then this movie is good i like scary movies especially chuckt this is going to be the number 1 movie in america i am going to see it though i give it 3 stars that is not bad
4,Seems alright so far,"well, I'll start out by saying I am buying the poster because it is hilarious. I'm always up for a sequel to 70's, 80's horror movies. NOES ones were good, the Halloween ones were alright but the Friday the 13th ones always kept me entertained. So, this one might not be half bad. I'm am going to give it a chance and see it. I hope everyone else will to."
3,Price up,It was still $20.49 a few days ago. It went up when I check it again. This was a must I was going to get but not anymore.....
2,They Should Have Stopped At Part 4 !!,"Being a Chucky fan, I've watched all the Child's Play movies. I enjoyed parts 1,2 and 3. However, with Bride of Chucky, these sequels became silly and this movie really takes the cake. Chucky and Tiffany have a child and they argue over the sex of the child! How silly. Chucky wants a son, so he calls the child Glen. Tiffany wants a daughter so she names the child Glenda. Glen/Glenda brings his parents back to life after they ""died"" in Bride of Chucky. Being brought back to life, Chucky and Tiffany want to continue their killing spree but Glen/Glenda is shocked at their behavior and doesn't want anything to do with killing. Overall, a stupid movie. The only good parts are the killing scenes of course. Otherwise, it's just plain silly and leaves you hoping that there won't be any more silly sequels like this one!!!"
3,Seed of Chucky DVD Review!,"The fifth entry in the ""Child's Play"" series is the most outrageous yet. More of a parody than a sequel, this installment finds Chucky complete with wife Tiffany and child Glen out for blood in Hollywood. Along for the ride are Jenniffer Tilly (who does an excellent job poking fun at herself), rapper Redman, and director John Waters. There's tons of over-the-top violence and humor but very little of anything else. Anyone expecting a horror film from ""Seed"" will be strongly dissapointed as its sole intention seems to be laughs, this go-around. Even ""Bride Of Chucky"" which had far more humor than the first three looks like a serious horror film in comparison."
5,what's wrong with you?,"so i'm reading some of these reveiws right, and some people are calling this movie crap ,horrible,pathetic,etc. just because it wasn't scary to them or wasn't like the ones before, BUT WHY ARE YOU PEOPLE TAKING IT SO SERIOUSLY!! IT'S A FREAKIN MOVIE!! YOUR SUPPOSED TO ENJOY MOVIES, NOT CRITICIZE IT BECAUSE IT DIDN'T LIVE UP TO YOUR REDICILOUS STANDARDS!!!people are still terrified of chucky, and some people like the comic side to him. movies are going to change, so just live with it.there is no reason getting so pissed over it. personally, i liked the movie's mix of horror and comedy, it's a good balence and i hope they make more chucky movies like this one."
3,You Can't Keep A Good Guy Down,"The writers and director of ""Seed of Chucky"" tried too hard to replicate the humor that worked so well in ""Bride of Chucky."" The result is that alot of the jokes seem forced and many of them just fall flat. The killings in the movie are good and Jennifer Tilly plays a pretty humorous version of herself. Redman is tolerable in the film...but should probably stick to his day job from now on.The extras on the DVD make it worth buying alone. Commentaries, interviews, behind-the-scenes....definitely worth it."
3,Go Tiffany!,"Move over Chucky for sure, Tiffany once again steals the show. For all those who enjoyed the tongue in cheek ""Bride of Chucky"", this new installment will provide you with more humourous moments. Jennifer Tilley is simply brilliant as the doll (Tiffany) and person.Seed of Chucky is about the child that Tiffany had with Chucky, and while it may not be as good as Bride of Chucky, it has some fine moments. Is their offspring a boy or a girl? Well, you decide! If you do not go in expecting to see fine cinema, then you will be ok. If you go in with the hope of a laugh or two, then you are set. The Tiffany doll really steals the show, she has so many amusing facial expressions. Well done to Jennifer Tilley who has provided the voice.Overall, a funny film with interesting special effects."
4,Child's Play 1 sold seperately..,"This Chucky Killer Collection contains 4 films on 2 flip discs from the Chucky/Child's Play series. Disc 1 side A contains ""Child's Play 2"", side B contains ""Child's Play 3"". Disc 2 side A contains ""Bride of Chucky"", side B contains ""Seed of Chucky"". All the bonus features are on ""Seed"" and ""Bride"" meaning there are no special features for part 2 & 3. If you want the UNRATED VERSION of ""Seed of Chucky"" you will have to purchase it elsewhere, this collection contains all R rated versions. Also Child's Play 1 isnt in this collection.. this is a ""Universal Pictures"" collection and the original Child's Play wasnt released by them. Plain and simple ""the reason why it's not included"".. all and all this is a nice little collection, my advice is to just buy the first movie seperately if you dont have it already but, for sure pick this up! It's at a great price for 4 movies!"
3,"""Seed-of-Chucky""","The New, outrageously hilarious 5th installment of the child's play series avenges theaters around the globe with some what known sucess. After i watched it, I was totally shocked because it was nothing like the others. ""Seed of Chucky"" was simply made well known as a comedy... telling elements of the new, and softer side of the maniac doll...CHUCKY, and how his new family goes through problems like any other family does. With Glen (the seed) now in the picture they must stick together as killer dolls to survive this one. At the end the seed managed to gain 3 & 1/2 stars from the critics and that is what i agree with too, if you are not a chucky fan it is still a funny, gorefest hell of a ride! and makes an okay rental for on-going movie lovers..take the day off and watch it twice or more."
2,conflicted in Pa,"Listen I love horror movies but I just don't know about this new chucky movie. I for one like my horror movies to flow in a formulaic way. You have the unsuspecting victims being silently stalked by a evil force that wants to enialate them. That works for me and when that is challenged I gotta pass on it.I loved every childs play movie but part 3, SO i was rather excited at the fact they were doin another one. With the introduction of Glen their whatever (i think son) I was excited about the possibility. But the premise of putting them in hollywood just seeems wrong. It seems extremely campy in a bad way. I think it might be a little too cheesy for my taste.I'm gonna see it anyway because I love horror movies. I am going in there with great skeptisim but nonetheless I'll check it out."
1,This is exactly what i'd hope the Chucky movies would never become: Silly,"Chucky and Tiffany [Voiced by Brad Dourif and Jennifer Tilly] are ressurrected. Only this time, They have a son [Who's shockingly sane and wants nothing to do with his parents' murderous activities]. The 3 are in Hollywood now and they continue their rampage there. This movie tryed way too hard to be funny, So hard in fact that this movie is not scary at all! This is the absolute worst of the Chucky series. If this series continues in this fashion, Then we can render this series officially dead. Rumor has it that there may be another Chucky movie coming out next year or 2009."
5,Movie,I order a movie but have problems with it and they were very good about helping me to return the movie for a refund
2,why?,I will never really understand why Hollywood will put together something that cost a lot of money even though it is a shot in the dark. This movie reminded me of Wes Craven's New Nightmare it was not scary at all and it had the actual actress Jeniffer Tilly star as herself in the movie which made it seem all the more ridicules and if that wasn't enough they cast rapper Redman in the movie as well!! I don't know why rappers think they can act on screen but in my opinion they should stick with being phooney gangsters over the sound waves it's best they stick with what luck they might have already. Anyway I saw in the special features that there might be a sixth Chucky later on down the road I hope it was just a dream because they cannot butcher this franchise anymore.
4,Good fun!!,"This movie is definitely better than Bride of Chucky (which is still a 4 star movie itself). The humour level, as well as the gore level pushes the boundries to the point where I was quite surprised that this un-rated version was allowed for release. Chucky's kid is hilarious!! If you enjoyed Bride of Chucky, don't hesitate to viddy this one."
2,The doom of Chucky...,"A quick note: Chucky is not scary anymore...even the violences are funny. If you are a fan of the Child's Play series, you were probably disappointed in Bride of Chucky and hoped for a better sequel next time around...Seed of Chucky doesn't do it, and I think they should stop making money out of Chucky and let him rest in peace. This sequel feels like ""Scary Movie: Chucky Edition""...the elements of suspense and apprehension are lost, replacing with comedy and humorous gore. Please don't buy or rent this if you are thinking you are going to watch a horror movie, because Seed of Chucky isn't one...unless you want to see Chucky masturbating or Jennifer Tilly's stupidity, please avoid this movie at all cost. (I don't even want to mention Glen/Glenda)."
3,Didn't care for it,"I liked the campy fun of Bride, but this one was just silly to me. The strange son of Chucky who has a Glen or Glenda personality seeks out his parents in this warped movie. Not really any scares, though there are some gorey scenes. The people in the film seem to be having fun, but it wasn't for me."
5,The Best Movie,This Movie Was the Best Movie You Will Ever Find! There Have Been Many Childs Play Series But This Is The Best! You Must Buy this Movie!
3,please bring back the old chucky,I liked Bride of Chucky but. . . I miss andy. COMEDY AND HORROR DO NOT MIX!!! Get that through your heads. I also miss the old Child's Play movies. Please let tiffany die and let chucky be his old self again. Do not kill andy if you take my advice to bring him back in another sequel. . . if you make another chucky.
2,I think Chucky lost his edge!,"This is probably Chucky's worst acting performance to date. I mean he seemed more into his character in his previous movies but this one was lacking. It seemed like he was just trying too hard to be funny and he kinda strayed from his evil side and became a comedian. I don't know if he was bored or felt he wasn't paid enough for this role but i suspect his acting career is over. Geez, maybe they should have just made a plastic doll, it would have been a lot cheaper than having to pay for this short greedy red head!"
2,disppointed,"very disappointed. The dvd did not correspond to the description : no packaging, just a simple amaray. This is not what I expected."
4,pat,The reason why the first movie ain't included in this collection is Child Play 1 is presented by MGM but the rest is presented by Universal Studios
1,they need to stop with this crap....I mean really,"that damn dool Chucky, voiced by Brad Dourif (Child's Play 1, 2 and 3, The Two Towers), is back for another stab and with the Bride Of Chucky, voiced by Jennifer Tilly and his Seed Of Chucky, voiced by Billy Boyd (The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy). the little punk slices his way towards Hollywood bringing his family along with him. Jennifer Tilly (The Cat's Meow, The Wrong Guy) who voices the Bride Of Chucky plays herself, the rapper RedMan (How High) plays himself as well and also director John Waters (Cry Baby, Cecil B. Demented, A Dirty Shame) as well. the doll is still stupid and the movie is dumb, boring, crappy and not that fun. trust me when I say this, that this is the reason why people need to stop making sequels to horror movies that really were only good in the first two installments, yeah. a waste of my time ladies and gentlemen"
1,Glen or Glenda?,"Horror comedy hybrids are a good way to for bad filmmakers to cover their back. If the film turns out to be unfunny they can say ""It's not supposed to be funny, it's a horror "". If it's not scary enough they can say ""I'ts not supposed to be that scary, it's a comedy"". If the film is just plain bad, they can say ""It's not supposed to be good, it's just a horror-comedy. Seed of Chucky doesn't work as a horror or a comedy. Despite one good line, It is not funny and it is not scary. However, you can help to laugh AT this film, because it is rediculously bad. The thing that is funny about it is that it was written and directed by an adult. Poeple with families spent energy and money working seriously on this thing. Chucky's son or daughter has to be seen to be beleived. He is the only thing that kept me watching."
3,Lets take a family trip to Hollywood,sounds like this is going to be just like Bride Of Chucky...unfunny jokes and pointless deaths all over the place...yea im going to go see it...but hoepfully its better than it sounds...and it sounds complicated...chuckys kid resurrects mommy and daddy and goes to hollywood to kill the cast of the movie that is being made about him (cough cough scream 3 cough cough)it will be fun...but when i go to see a chucky movie...i dont want fun...i want the foul mouth killing machine! hopefully this movie is a good one and is better than Bride of Chucky...
3,Good set of horror flicks at a good price.,"For the price, you can't beat this set of films.Too bad the first, and best film, ""Child's Play"", is not included.Nothing beats the original killer doll film, ""Trilogy Of Terror"", which this appears to have been influenced by.Horror fans shouldn't forget one of the even earlier original killer doll stories, ""Talky Tina"", from the original ""Twilight Zone"" series."
1,BUYERS BEWARE!!,"This item does NOT fit LG vx7000 even though it's listed among tne many on Amazon's site. On the underside of the part that plugs into the phone, there are 3 notches on this FAUX item as opposed to the 2 that are on the REAL item. I have found out the hard way that the items under the 'WIRELESS TECHNOLOGIES' name do not fit the cell phones that they claim they should fit & are substandard. Therefore, I recommend that you save money in the long run & buy the better or original equipment offered by the cellular company in the first place. Wish I could give it zero stars."
1,"Ultra Slim Travel Charger for LG C1300, F9100, L1400, VX4500",Charger just didn't work. I guess the price was just too good to be true. Ended up buying a universal charger at Radio Shack that worked fine
1,Made no difference in my running performance...,"I bought this product hoping it would improve my running performance and after using it for 4 months, there has been no change. My 1600 and 3200 times have remained the same and my 5k time has actually gotten worse. I don't know if there are any objective, measurable benefits to be had by taking this product. It seems that the placebo effect is all it has to offer.In short, I wish I hadn't wasted my money buying this."
1,excellent,"As a cancer survivor who has had hormone therapy, I have no testosterone in my body, thus no energy. Endurox enables me to have all the energy I need to ride my recumbent bike, do extreme exercises, etc."
4,Endurox helps my workouts!,"This product helps me to sustain my workouts, especially after I have been taking it for a while. For me, better workouts translate to more effective weight maintenance and toning. It can be difficult to find, however, so if you can find a good source, stick with it. While the product works just fine for me, Amazon's vendor, Vitamin Life, was less than pleasant to deal with. So if you want to boost your workout capacity, try this product, just be careful where you source it!!"
4,Great product,"Excelent for endurance training, results are evident after a couple of weeks. Try it also with good supplements for long rides or runs."
5,Great to improve your performance,I run regularly (30-40 miles per week) as I'm training for marathons. Since I started taking endurox I noticed an improvement in my performance. I can run faster and for longer. I also feel the recovery is shorter. I take it every morning and it works great for me.
2,No benefits yet...,"To set the stage, I am a huge fan on Pacific Health Labs / Endurox products. I have used and continue to use Accelerade, Endurox R4, Accel gel, all with success.I bought 60 days worth of this supplement and have been taking them for about two weeks during my tri training. I have yet to notice any change in performance as suggested by the package. I haven't witnessed any noticeable improvement in performance during workouts or post workout recovery. If anything changes I will update this review but at this point I will not be re-ordering this product but plan to stick with the other Pacific Health lineup. My advice is to use Accelerade, gel and R4 instead of Endurox Excel."
4,Endurox - Good endurance supplement,"I've been user of this product for more than 4 years, one month prior my 26.2 mile marathon, and it really works reducing a few bpm of my heart rate. I recommend it."
5,Nice live performances,"Art Blakey was truly one of the greatest bebop performers in the history of the genre. While he recorded much better albums than this one, he still shines through on this one."
3,Slugs is where Lee Morgan was murdered,He was shot outside of Slug's where he was working by his jealous wife. Nuff said. Did I mention that I rule?
3,last choice for a hits package,"Dion and the Belmonts are an excellent group. I bought a used copy of this CD for $2. The songs are wonderful. Amazon lists this CD as being released in 1995, the back of my CD is copyrighted 1992, and I believe the mastering for this CD was done at least that long ago, actually the sound quality sounds like it was not remastered at all and the sound quality is mushy. I have several DION songs that are in this collection from two other bargain collections of various artists and the sound quality on this EMI collection is the worst of the group. I have a few of these 10 Best Series EMI collections of other artists and for the price, found the sound quality to be Ok. I just can't recommend this album. Try a different Dion collection."
1,Awful Quality control! 2 out of 3 stopped working in less than one month,"I bought three of these for about $29 each (not thru Amazon). I wanted to use them in my garage in the winter as it get a bit chilly in there. I figured I only needed 2 for the task but bought a third becuase of the good price and 'just in case'...Well, the first one died in less than a week and another died in less than a month...nothing happend to cause these issues...I just set them for 70 degrees and one day I went to turn them on and they were dead. My guess is the fuse 'safety' or heat sensor technology on these is garbage and just blows for no good reason. There does not seem to be any way to replace the fuse so they are pretty much door stops now.Any product can have the odd lemon, but two out of three for a single customer that use them for about an hour or two at a time is pretty awful.I would avoid these like the plague and I am not inclined to ever buy a Honeywell product in the future."
1,Heater worked for 6 months,"This heater only worked for 6 months, after 6 months the product stopped working. It does not come on at all. I have tried to plug the heater in different outlets and it still does not work. I feel like I just wasted $40. I will never purchase another Honeywell heater."
2,Disappointed that heater no longer works,"I bought the HZ-365 (probably same heater) a couple years ago in case it got cold in our finished lower level. We had a couple of occasions to use it and it performed okay. It looked pretty cool and the remote control is a nice feature. We moved into an active adult community (no steps, slab, heat vents from the ceiling) and some areas get a bit chilly in the winter. I plugged in our Honeywell heater and nothing. No lights come on. Nothing happens. I read in the manual that the unit cannot be disassembled. It has a tip-over switch that is probably stuck. Anyway, don't know how to get repaired under 5-year warranty as proof of purchase is long gone. I'm disappointed that I shelled out 40 bucks for a product that I got to use only a few times."
3,"Great heat, but NOT for a quiet environment","This unit throws an impressive amount of heat for its size, but the fan is quite loud. As mentioned in other comments the thermostat feature seems to measure something internal, so even set at the highest temperature (95) it will cycle on and off every few minutes. The fan going on an off is loud enough that it keeps me from getting to sleep so we've found it unusable in the bedroom. But in a small room where the loud fan won't be noticed this gives a lot of heat for the money."
3,"OK, but substandard performance on some features.","This heater will keep a room warm. But, like other reviewers have said, the thermostat isn't very accurate, and the oscillation feature fails too soon. The mechanism begins grinding and eventually oscillation stops entirely (it only took a few months of frequent use to fail in my case). The remote control is a nice touch though."
4,had this for years it works great,not sure if mine is just an older model but i use it with the temperature setting all the time and it works great. i have never had a 30 degree variation of what it reads and what the room temp is at. i use it in my bathroom primarily and sometimes in my bedroom both rooms are small.
2,Automatic Mode Useless,"Got one of these today. Thot the other guys that had this problem were just unlucky, and decided to trust the Honeywell name. Boy, was I wrong. SureSet, my foot. The thermostat in this device does indeed seem to be measuring the temperature of the unit itself, although not the actual element, maybe the heated plastic body. I do not recommend that anyone buys this heater if they want to use the automatic mode. It functions well in the high and low constant heating mode. I have a lasko 5365 heater as well, that works well in all modes.Update: Lasko 5365 is displaying same odd thermostat behaviour, I am beginning to think this behaviour is a product of the environment where the heater is used, and not just poor manufacturer design.Update 2: Confirmed that 5365 thermostat works fine if heater placed in middle of open space to be heated as opposed to against a wall. HZ-338 thermostat performance doesn't seem to improve when in open area."
2,Beware! MELTING CASE,"My daughter has been using this unit in her bedroom everyday this winter. It does a good job of heating her room. HOWEVER - I've noticed that the plastic case has actually started to warp and MELT, the seam where it's put together is starting to open, you can see the wiring inside."
2,Honeywell HZ-338 space heater,"This Honeywell HZ-338 Sure-Set Ceramic Heater with Oscillation space heater is ideal for a small and confined space, such as under a secretary's desk, a small bathroom with low ceiling. But if you are looking for a space heater to keep a bedroom warm, this one won't do."
1,Honeywell HZ-338-TGT Heater,We purchased HZ-338-TGT for a gift and my 90 year old mother-in-law used it twice before it quit working completely. It couldn't have stopped at a worst time because we were experiencing minus 0 chill factors and blizzard conditions.It doesn't even power up or show any indication that it may work. We did some research on the web and found others have similar problems with the same heater.I called to check out the return policy and was shocked to find out that we had to return it at our cost and on top of that send in 10.00 for handing fees with no reimbursement. This seems pretty absurd because the product is evidently defective. This isn't what I expected from a name brand of Honeywell and the Kaz Company.We will never buy another Honeywell product. There are other brands out there with better customer service.
1,Like having a LAWN MOWER in your living room.,"The fan assembly must be of very poor quality. I've seen this model work well which is why I bought it. But I bought 2 of them at 2 different places including 1 from Amazon and both of them had this horrible fan noise.My guess is they had a bad lot of them with bad fans, they should pull these off the market until they can get the fan problem fixed."
2,Noisy and quit with barely any use,"Cannot recommend this at all. The temperature settings are either ""roast"" or ""useless"", the noise level is like having a small engine in the room with you, and it barely projects 6 feet beyond where it sits. What a waste of money - and I paid full original price for this. Honeywell needs to do some serious quality checks in their home appliance sector.... infant death may be common in the electronics market but that doesn't mean consumers are enjoying shelling out cash over and over again year after year."
3,driving game,"I bought this for my 6 yr old who masters games. He has ps1, ps2 ,game boy color and game boy advanced. He hates this game. Its hard to control, it came with out instructions ( which I knew buying it used) but I figured how hard could a driving game be? Its hard- dont buy this for your small child ( under 8) because Im an adult and I couldnt get it to drive straight or do what I wanted it to either."
1,Stupid Game!!!!!!!!!,This game is one of the worst games I've ever played and I've played a lot of bad games. Do not buy it. I wasted thirty dollars on it.
4,Find delight in your own life,"Priestley has an eye for the ordinary and the exceptional, and shows us that the difference is more related to our attitude.Reading these brief essays, which cover everything from daily routines to singular moments in time, I found that they stirred memories of my own joys from younger days, and pointed out that delight is often something not realized until one looks back.These essays are delights in themselves, but for me, the real value of the book is in training my 'eye' to note the delightful as I trudge through the everyday."
2,Hawkwind - 'Silver Machine' (Hallmark Records),"A cheezy eleven track compilation of mostly(if not all)cuts that you can also find on the three 'Acid Daze' volumes.Sound quality isn't that great on every tune,but it varies.Not the best place to start if you're a new fan(could there possibly be any out there?).Cuts that I thought were so-so include ""Hurry On Sundown"",Nik Turner's oddity ""Ghost Dance"",""Angel Of Death/Magnu"" and the late poet Bob Calvert's ""Earth Calling"".What's with the tune ""British Tribal Music""?Should've kept that in the vault.For completists and die-hards only."
3,Hawkwind - 'Silver Machine' (Red Cab Records),"Eleven track CD compilation of (seemingly) alternate edits of some of Hawkwind's best earlier material. May even be some single versions of certain songs here, but I'm almost sure none of these are the 'original' album mixes. Tunes like ""Silver Machine"", ""Damnation Alley"", the Robert Calvert gem ""Aero Spaceage Inferno"", ""Time We Left"" and their space exploration rectial ""Black Corrider"" are always good to hear. Aimed toward the die-hard fans and the old school completists. If you're a new / er Hawkwind fan (if that's even possible) or a casual fan, you might still get something from this disc."
2,"A good Western novel, nothing more","A pretty good western story, set on the border of Arkansas and the Indian Territory in the 1890s. It is a good read, however, it is pure fiction. If you are looking to actually learn about the historic characters portrayed in the book, go to the library and check out a history book. This novel strays from the truth in a pretty wide manner.All in all, it is a fun story!"
5,WOW,"All I can say is: ""WOW"", what a game! This game is awesome. But I would only recommend it for people that have finished the 1st one, otherwise, it is kind of hard to understand."
3,Not worth the effort,This Syphon Filter is not as well put together as the firstone was what is this sneaking around and using your taser on guys instead of shooting them in the head and you play as both Gabe Logan and Lian Xing its just not as good as Syphon Filter but one good bright spot the weapons are still cool!
1,Why is this thing so popular?,"For some reason, these games sell well. Boggles the mind. This game is just as bad as the first, probably worse. The controls aren't as responsive as they should be and the graphics are just bad. Playstation graphics aren't always the best but they can be much better than this chunky, ugly game. It's also too hard. Challenge is one thing, but enemies that can take you down before you can see them isn't fair or even remotely close to being fun. Do not get this game!"
2,none,"This is'nt great If you've allready played #1 aside from the fact that it is an entirely different story and the adition of lian as aplayable character, but the gameplay is the same a few new weapons but nothing major. My maine point is don't buy this game if you didn't majorly enjoy #1."
1,you have too be kidding,"This game is one of the worst I've played. If you want a game full of suspense,realism, and intrigue then this game is NOT for you. If you want a game of mindless running and constant shooting then by all means this is it. There is no reality here. It takes 30 bullets to kill anyone! You are just running blind hoping not to get killed. If you want a realistic game full of suspense and excitement then buy Medal of Honor. Leave Syphon Filter II to the two year olds."
4,Syphon Filter 2,"Syphon Filter was perhaps my favorite game, so I was very anxious for the 2nd. Well I wasnt let down I'm happy to say. The story basicly takes off right where the first ends. The only difference is SF2's story line if much deeper, interaction with other characters in the missions not just inbetween missions. If you liked the first one, you wont be dissapointed by the 2nd :) BTW more weapons :)"
5,all that and a bag of guns,"This game raises the age old question, is the sequel better than the original? The answer is given about 10 seonds into the game. Heck with Metal gear, this game kicks. And why not play as more than just Gabe? The texures are more fluid than before, and the missions are harder. It's as much of a shoot 'em up like the first was. You have to sneak around more, which makes the game more intersting. you won't be disappointed with the game. If you do i'll buy the game off you. Just kidding."
3,"A decent sequel, but not as good as the original","Don't get me wrong, Syphon Filter 2 is a great game, but I expected more. The original is one of my favorite games, and this doesn't live up to it's potential. It has many tedious missions that were annoying. The level were you had couldn't kill the G.I.'s was awful. Overall, it was a good game, but the original was much better."
4,Syphon Filter 2 is a great game!,"Syphon Filter 2 is a great game! If you liked Syphon Filter 1 you will probably love the new Syphon Filter, but if you don't know the story of Syphon Filter 1 you may have a hard time understanding the plot and the different character. Fortunately this can be easily overlooked, because this is a truly great game."
1,SHAME on YOU,"As I read more labels I am finding out that the FDA is not on the consumer side. ""If it tastes like ""apricot,"" it can legally be called ""apricot.""The FIRST FOUR INGREDIENTS DON'T INCLUDE APRICOTS.The INGREDIENTS of this ""Apricot Syrup"" are:SUGAR, INVERT SUGAR, WATER, APPLE JUICE CONCENTRATE, Apricot juice from Concentrate, PEAR, Clarified LIME and Clarified LEMON JUICE Concentrates, Citric Acid, xanthan gum, Natural FLAVOR, Beta Carotene (Vitamin A)Because you CHEAT the CONSUMER, I WILL NOT BUY FROM YOU AGAIN, MAPLE FARMS."
1,Very sweet,I could not get the Maple Grove Farms rasberry syrup so I decided to try their apricot syrup. It isalmost sickly sweet. I could only recommend this syrup for those who have a strong sweet tooth. I never knew apricots were so sweet!
4,Longing for the ludic,"An excellent book, within the constraints the author sets for himself, to deal primarily with what could ahistorically, but reasonably be called ""situationist"" architecture and architectural theory. There is no doubt the book makes bored, sensitive fellows like myself want to go out and do something to keep these insane transformational ideas alive and working in culture. I'd love to have a list of all the other bored people, we could have a big party."
4,bit late but looks fine,"arrived a bit late due to technical issues, but condition is finethe re-delivery system is fine also"
1,the worst,"You could hardly find a greater betrayal of the Situationist movement in all of its aspects, than this book, which translates a chaotic, exciting and iconoclastic movement into a boring and platitudinous addition to the obligatory academic discourse about everything.Throw this thing in the trash, don't even resell it, certainly don't donate it to any charities or libraries. Go right now instead and find ""The Situationist International: A User's Guide"" by Simon Ford, you won't regret it. I swear to God I am not lying and I have no institutional or other affiliation that would conflict with this judgment."
5,AN OLD FRIEND,"I read MOV about more than a decade ago as a young teenager discovering love and romance. The development of Philippa and Rohan throughout the years was wonderful and exciting. As the plot unfolds we discover a longlasting love between two people dealing with the uncertainty of youth, promise for the future, and pressures of family. A must read!"
4,Inspiring Aewsome Dance Music,"Well this is 6 years after mr. evil reviewed the song. I'm not sure what he was smokin. The song is aewsome. Her vocals are aewsome. It's easy to rip on something. My question is, why waste the time?Check the samples, make your own decision."
4,S&M,"A tour-de-force from a New York writer who brings all the rough-hewn sensibilities of his Yorkshire birthplace to bear on the wonders of metropolitan life and the people who live there. Truly S&M (Sensitive and Mean). Full of lines, and couplets, and triplets that you want to commit to memory for use as little mantras when encountering the slings and arrows flesh is heir to."
2,Nota bene:,"I loved this charger, until I found that, over time, it had pushed apart the plastic frame of my IIIc so that the charger contacts would no longer work, either on the travel charger or the original hotsync module. Palm.com said they could fix it--upon payment of the hefty out-of-warranty repair charge. I'm looking into Handsprings now . . . ;-)"
2,DISAPPOINTING REMASTERS 2007 JAPANESE VERSION.,"I am a long time fan of this band, but I'm disappointed with quality of this Japanese 2007 Reissue. Other Universal titles as Lynyrd Skynyrd for example the sound is very superior than ABB 2007 reissue.The Package is excellent, lyrics both English and Japanese, but the quality of sound could be better. 2 Stars."
3,couldnt find forever,"Commons album finding forever lacked a lot of his real raw talent. Not only he didnt have enough tracks but some songs were lame. The people, driving me wild, I want you and u,black maybe are the only tracks worth listening to. He should of made this an ep or mixtape."
3,Finding uncommon ground,"Common forever walks that line between accessibly disposable and authentically memorable hip-hop, and with many cuts by effective producer West, continues to build off the underground creative momentum of Be."
3,Pretty Good CD!,To me this a pretty much pop oriented album as well. It's a great predacessor to Universal Mind Control. I loved the duet with lilly allen. i thought start the show was pretty fun to listen to.The game was a pretty good track as well. With this album he does a great job of being experimental while trying to stick to rapping at the same time as well. If you love rap and r&b you def. will not be disappointed by this cd. I also think Kanye West did an execellent job of producing this cd. It's def. worth buying.
3,Riddled with to much filler,"Commons 2007 release ""Finding Forever"" isnt a horrid album, but it falls victim to a bit to much ""pop"" hip-hop here, and ruins the flow of what could have been an outstanding release, espically in day and age where hip-hop, once a strong, and diverse music, which has gotten ruined by the world of todays pop scene. I wasnt thrilled on how the album started out, in fact I only found ""The People"" to be the only good song out of the first five tracks. The album picks up a bit with Southside, then it goes on a roll, with The Game, U Black Maybe, and So far to Go. Break my Heart and Forever Begins are pretty good tracks also, but out of Twelve tracks, there are only six on here that really shine, and have the alternitve sound that Common is known for. SO its not a horrid release, some good stuff here, and its worth a purchase, but I wouldnt pay top dollar for it. Get it used and cheap"
4,A good album,"What I like about this album, and about Common, is that its not lame. What I'm referring to is the crap thats out today commercially. All the cursing, ignorance, degrading of women, you just get tired of it. Common delivers a good album with sincere rhymes. My favorite tracks are ""Start the Show"", ""The People"", ""The Game"", ""Black Maybe"", and ""Misunderstood"". The album is very mellow. That might be the main downside though. The melodies kind of lull you to sleep but the lyrics keep you alert. Buy it if you enjoy real hip-hop."
2,Why have I always struggled to like Common?,"I am mainly just writing this review to counter how overrated I think that Common is. In terms of evolving as an artist, Common seems to have done very little. But maybe that is what people like, they know what sound they are going to get and get it. As for me, I have an increasing sensation that this album lacks originality and that Common is continually putting out a product. I'm sure many people will will not like this review but maybe you should. Make sure you listen to some of the songs before you buy it. Because perhaps you may already have an album very very similar to this, it's called BE."
1,A Common Sense fan's worst nightmare,"I've been following Common for a long time, purchasing his CD's to support his music. Back when he was Common Sense a rapper who rapped like a poet. His music had great beats, great lyrics, and it just made you feel good overall.This new CD was terrible. The lyrics are unoriginal and lame. Choruses overrun the song when before Common was all about his lyrics. I don't know what more to say, I won't be recommending this to anybody."
1,Disgusting!,"With the horrible album cover driving me to scratch my skin raw, I gave this album a chance (I was given for Xmas). I was instantly driven to tears with the sound coming from my speakers. Typical ""soul"" music from a publicly appointed ""hip-hop artist"". There is nothing smart about this music at all. Nothing engaging or in the least bit attractive. Please do not call this ""one named dude"" an artist. Simply more trash for used CD bins."
3,NOT HIP HOP but A NICE POP ALBUM!,"This a nice Pop album, but it's not Hip Hop. not Common's fault, just the way it is. There isn't much that can be said by a rapper anymore...and there aren't that many samples or beats that we haven't heard before. I mean, DJ Premier is going to come up with something new after all these years?!Electirc Circus was a flawed work of genius and Like Chocolate is probably the 'best' Common record that ever will be. But if you like Common like I do, even a weak 'Pop' album is worth buying. Remember, in baseball if you hit .300 you still make out 7 times out of ten. This one is a line drive out to the center fielder."
4,Not bad,"Not a bad album, worth buying. Deffinately not Common's best, I actually liked Be more than this one. Production on ""People"" and ""So Far to Go"" are worth the purchase alone.Lyrics are good compared to many other rappers, but just average for Common. Nothing more to say."
4,"Not quite forever, but good nonetheless","I just picked this up yesterday so I really haven't had enough time to absorb this and determine whether or not it will stick with me but I did want to respond to the notion that Common wanted to create music that 'exists forever'.If he intends to create music that stands the test of time it would probably be within his best interests to leave out all the pop culture references that will fade. Things like 'Finding Nemo' a music video by 'Ok Go', film 'Akeelah and the bee' .. and thats just in the first few tracks.Aside from the pop references this album is a quality release as can be expected from Common. Most of the production from Kanye West is great (just wish West would stay away from the mic and stick to producing)."
5,Perfect,"I personally thought ""BE"" was solid if unspectacular, but ""Finding Forever"" is without a flaw. I'm on my 3rd copy already because people will not give this CD back if you loan it out, so be forewarned! There is simply not a bad song in this entire bunch and picking favorites is really beside the point, but I will tell you the moment I fell in love with this insta-classic, when the bass and background vocals drop out on ""U, Black Maybe"" and Common starts his spoken-word confessional over a simple backdrop of bongos, about the persecution we face from other people including ""your own"", I cried. Another highlight is the superb ""I Want You"" produced by and featuring wil.i.am. on an addictive chorus. Props to Kanye West for his great contributions, my favorite being the classic ear-rattling boom-bap on the opener ""Start The Show"". This is the best 'real' hip hop album since last year's ""Game Theory"" by his comrades The Roots. Essential listening."
5,Playing Forever,"When I bought this album, I played so much within a 24-hour period that I scratched it and of course, I have to but it again. If you are Common fan you will like this album, if you are a hip-hop fan you will like this album. The two tracks that were released for this album (""The People"" and ""The Game"") were good but my favorite tracks were ""U, Black Maybe"" and ""Misunderstood"". Common remains one of the most underrated artist in hip-hop, ""Finding Forever"" is another great album from an un-Common artist."
5,COMMON IS GOOD TO HAVE,THIS ALBUM AS WHOLE IS GOOD.COMMON SEEMS TO START AND FINISH HIS ALBUMS THE SAME SINCE HE'S BEEN WITH KANYE.HE BROUGHT BACK THAT WATER FOR CHOCOLATE ALBUM FEEL. DEFINITELY A REFRESHING FEELING WHEN YOU HERE THIS ONE.THIS ONE IS A TIMELESS CLASSIC.
5,Finding Forever,This cd is phenomenal! The artistic and producing style of Common is incredible. I'm in love with just about all the tracks on this cd. Some reach back to the old school (The Game) while others are contemporary and novel. I cannot believe I've slept on this artist this long but I do intend to pick up his other cds. Common definitely has the longevity and talent to leave an indelible mark on hip hop.
4,Be-sides,"This is still one of the better hip-hop albuums out this year. Common didn't try to expand on anything here but instead kept the same formula he did from the last album. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Even though this sounds like BE b-sides it's still beyond what alot of cats is putting out right now. Kanye's production seems a little more refined which is great because most producers, after the amount of work he's put in, run out of beats after a while. The only thing that got me was the track with D'Angelo he did. It's not a new track but rather borrowed from a J-Dilla album. I under stand that's his boy and all and you want to keep his spirit alive and all but you could have picked a better track with you on it. Not that it's a bad song it just seemed out of place.But I digress, if you're a Common fan buy this. If you're a Hip-Hop head buy this. Hell if you just like good music and opened minded buy this. It is definitely worth it."
5,Common does it again,Amazing Album. Things come together for both Kayne and Common on this album. This is the album of the year and can't be missed.
3,not bad,"this cd is ok,but i know common is a much better mc,than you here on this album,also these days its like kanye west is keeping all the dope beats for himself,now that hes famous,and where does that leave common,with a cd that could of been much better,but if you like commons last cd be,then this cd wont dissapoint you"
5,"Teeny, Tiny Terrific",This book is a MUST-HAVE for anyone who wants a sweet story that teaches colors. Great pictures!
1,book,This book was for a Christmas present. My granddaughters favorite book. I ordered it early in November. After it didn't arrive by the first of Dec. I emailed the company. It took them a week to answer then another week to tell me what happened. They resent it but it still never arrived. They did refund my money that's why they got the one star. I won't order from here again.
5,Superb Harmonies,I've been listening to these guys since I adored them in the 60s. Decades later and they are still my favourites. Every song on this CD is performed and produced beautifully. These guys can really sing and don't need to yell to show it - they choose great songs and then give them really professional treatment. It's wonderful to have the songs now on CD so I can listen to them for a few decades more.
5,The Bachelors,I played and played my vinyl record and then cassettes became the go and then CD's reunited me with my favorite trio
4,the best yearly gp bike book,"Without a doubt its the BEST yearly Motorcycle Grand Prix, Superbike and Isle of Man review. There is nothing else that even comes vaguely close."
3,A family of games for a family of people,"The following are a list of the games. This game pack is just all right, and the game is very dated, though.Blackjack, Totem Slots, Monster Madness Slots, Pearly Deep Slots, Neon Luau Slots, Sun Catcher Slots, Double Down Video Poker, Jacks or Better Video Poker, Joker's Wild Video Poker, 10's or Better Video Poker, Deuces Wild Video Poker, Reversi, Chess, Backgammon, Checkers, Dominoes, Klondike Solitaire, Auld Lang Syne Solitaire, Calculation Solitaire, Scorpion Solitaire, Flower Garden Solitaire, Spades, Go Fish, Hearts, Old Maid, Crazy Eights"
2,"Mediocre phone, at best.","I've had this phone for about 2 years and 8 months, and I got it as part of a new-phone-every-3-years deal. I honestly don't think my phone will last two more months.Everytime I have dropped this phone, it has broken. Sometimes just a piece or button will fall off, and sometimes it completely comes apart and I have to spend 20 minutes reassembling it. Keep in mind, these are not falls from my apartment balcony, they are falls from my back pocket or my hand to the ground (3-5 feet drops).I have had to replace this phone TWICE. One time, it rained and the phone was in my pocket. That completely killed it.So technically, I have had THIS phone for 10 months, and it is falling apart- all of the side buttons are falling off and i have to hold the casing in place when the phone is flipped open.The camera quality is poor, and there is nothing special about this phone."
2,Wouldn't recommend,"I have this LG phone for a year now, and I have a lot to say about it.The Pros: Good reception. Easy to hold (not to small like some cell phones are) and has a little bit more weight to it (which I prefer).The Cons: 2 phones later and they both have a short battery life. They both also shut off in the middle of a conversation ALL the time. The phone will power off for no apparent reason, and it will do so if you go to answer it and pick it up the wrong way. The battery doesn't seem to stay charged for as long as I'd like.About the Camera: I think it's crap, but it's a cell phone, in my personal opinion, it's not meant to be taking award winning pictures. So neither a pro or a con, just what I'd expect from a camera on a cell phone.Overall: For all the hassle I have with it shutting down all the time, I wouldn't recommend it."
2,Good for callling people.......,"This phone is decent if all you need it for is to call people. It is nothing special. Ya the time scrolls across the front screen and lights blink for a few seconds... but this phone is not that good other than that. It only holds 20 pictures and the memory sucks. If you want to get songs sent to ur phone from online forget about it, it only holds 5 sec. of a song."
3,Not for Everyone,"Golden Earring Live is not for everyone. If you are a die hard Earring fan, you will definitly enjoy this album. It is a honest, on the spot live recording, despite the fact that there is a extra guitar part all the way thru the recording that is not Barry Hay. Whomever did the job, however, was very capable. Barry's vocals get a bit lost in some parts of the recording, but there are many moments of sheer rock-n-roll magic that make it worth while. George Kooymans does a wonderful job of reproducing some very difficult harmony vocals with Barry. All in all, I would have to recommend it to all earring fans EXCEPT those who expect a perfect and polished product. This is a kick ass live rock-n-roll recording, warts and all."
5,Vanilla Queen - live 1977,"This live performance of ""The Vanilla Queen"" is one of my favorite long songs in history--composed, sang, and played in awesome fashion with such a beautiful, powerful ending. If you like this type of long, ""epic"" song, check out ""Thick as a Brick"" by Jethro Tull, and ""In Held 'Twas I"" by Procol Harum.Golden Earring's ""Moontan"" album is awesome, every second of it (the gray one with the ear & earring on the cover). It's 2011, and I have never gotten tired of it--it is so good!"
5,Sony 3DMR30 8CM DVD-R Discs,The seller was prompt and courteous with the transaction. The goods were delivered even sooner than expected. I highly recommend this vendor.
5,WOW!!!! PLEASANTLY SURPRISED!!!!!!,"I've ordered other products from this website before and I have NEVER been dissatisfied, thank goodness :-D However, when it comes to quick delivery these people were the quickest. This perfume is extremely hard to find and smells HEAVENLY!!!!! I will continue to order from this site and hope more people do too :-D"
1,I think it is unnessesary,"I personally believe that it is unnesesary to use a ""kit"" to clean your old cartrage systems. I currently own the NES, N64, & Gameboy Color, but the NES is the only system that I normally get trouble out of.When the screen is blinking on and off, or when there is ""garble"" on your TV, it usually means that there is a poor electrical connection between the contacts, which is often caused by dirt or grime.If blowing on them doesn't work, which is usually the case. I use an old toothbrush and rubbing alcohol for the cartrages, and a small paintbrushfor the console; just dip it in, shake it, and scrub; it works perfect 98% of the time and will not corrode the contacts."
5,Acoustic Glory,"I saw this CD in a store and looked it up just because of the awesome cover, then bought it. Trust me foo'; not only does Fruitvale rock, it provides sensation for the senses like you've never sensed before from a CD. F that- from anything. And if I don't sound legit enough for you then just read the other reviews from those who use grammar and probably have jobs."
5,outstanding music,"I was very impressed with the composition and execution of all tracks on this cd. From the the good flow of ""She Said"" to the fast sound of ""Margaritaville"", an all out good disc. (I like their version of ""Margaritaville"" better than Buffet's)."
3,"Love the picture, wanted it bigger though",3 stars only because I would have liked for it to have been bigger. Otherwise the picture quality is great.
3,Pretty good,"I picked up this book as a fan of Jordan's Wheel of Time, and the Schwarzenegger Conan movies. I figure put the two together and we're in business. I gotta tell ya... That wasn't far from the truth.In ""Conan the Defender"", our hero arrives in the city of Belverus to, again, find work to fill his gold purse. His plan is to raise his own company of warriors, but Civil war threatens in the Kingdom- and he must choose sides between his friends and the King. But first he must find out who has been trying to kill him and why.-I can't compare this to R. E. Howard's works, (I haven't read any yet) but this has sure made me open to checking those out in the future. An enjoyable read.-And sure it's not Wheel of Time, but I can definitely see the seeds of a great author taking root."
4,Remote spots,"How did Millman manage to find such remote spots in the world? It's not like you can advertise and have people tell you about these places. Nevertheless, somehow Millman did find these odd places and visited them. The stories he tells while visiting here and there, way, way, way off the map, edge into the unbelievable.I read and read and read. After I finished each chapter, I'd draw another big red X on my map of places I someday want to visit, though Millman has taken me about as close to these spots as I ever want to go."
3,Pretty good but .....,"The author is without a doubt an excellent writer. However, before one buys the book, they should know that all of the stories are relatively brief essays that have appeared previously in magazines. In fact, I would say that many of the stories are from Islands magazine. As a subscriber to that magazine, I was disappointed to find that so much of Millman's previous work is repeated here. Recommended if you have not read Islands Magazine- otherwise you might want to reconsider."
5,"An in-depth, comprehensive history and presentation.","Libby Hill's The Chicago River is the result of years of painstaking research and presents an outstanding historical survey of the Chicago River from its creation by pre-glacial forces, to the days of the French explorers using it to access the Mississippi, to its contemporary presence in one of the most densely populated urban areas in the Midwest. The Chicago River is an in-depth, comprehensive work that reveals the never ending struggle between humans and nature over the centuries, as well as the commercial, recreational, and ecological projects currently underway on and in the river. The Chicago River is highly recommended, rewarding reader for those with an interest in Chicago, natural history, environmental issues, and Midwestern history."
3,School Assignment,This book was assigned for my World History class and well I don't think I would have read it if it wasn't assigned. I found it to be interesting and m easy read. I would recommend it to anyone who has an interested in Asian Culture.
1,... Deceiving ...,"Unfortunately, I too cannot recommend this record : it contains a performance close to platitude, a deceiving approach to a fine early work now represented in the catalog by such [examplary] names like Berglund, Segerstam, Vanska or Saraste. Despite some superb singing efforts by distinguished soloists and also by the choruses who sometimes have their moments, the end result leaves something to be desired. I totally agree with the other review and can't figure out how some reviewers or magazines have come to overestimate this disc. Even the Panula-Naxos is preferable."
1,DON'T BUY THIS BOOK,"If I could give this book negative stars, I would. I have taken Epps's class and have had to use this book extensively. Not only was it useless at teaching me, it actually confused me about the concepts...."
4,Forgotten Classics!,"If you listen to the radio, you will not find these songs anywhere. They are not played on the oldies channels which tend to focus on the group's 60's material, and you won't find it on the ""Classic Rock"" stations. This is unfortunate. Perhaps it has something to do with the relative lack of commercial success of most of these songs. This is sad, as I feel that this period was one of the most creative for the band. ""Add Some Music To Your Day"" is one of the group's best. I was always a fan of the Holland album and was happy to see that the ""The Trader"" and ""California Saga"" were included. The covers of ""Peggy Sue"", ""Come Go With Me"" and ""California Dreamin'"" are surprisely enjoyable. While this material is not as well known as their 60's classics, it has aged very well and stands the test of time. Recommended for all fans of the Beach Boys."
4,A solid collection,"Like all who are great in youth, The Beach Boys fell victim to their own success. It is nearly impossible to objectively judge this collection in light of the golden treasures that came before. Yet, much of this music is certainly strong enough to earn our appreciation on its own merits. The early Seventies work shows the talent of Brian Wilson's bandmates (beginning with 1970's SUNFLOWER material) while also recalling his own genius (Surf's Up). Later recordings are a bit more slight, but still highly enjoyable. Recommended."
3,Add Some Music To Your Day!,"If there's an obvious fault to all three of Capitol's recent Beach Boys collections, it's a peculiar insistance on tacking on their eighties hits, out of sequence, and out of chronological order. It wouldn't have been too challenging to come up with a separate eighties compilation.However, ""Brother Years"" is the most cohesive of the lot, featuring several tracks never before available on CD. With the tried and true fans already looking forward to again hearing the individual Brother releases on CD, consider ""Brother Years"" as a preview, with a few unique cuts to boot.And for those who may not be quite so discerning, take the advice of the many reviewers who've owned these songs on 45's, 8-tracks, LP's, and by now, several issues on CD. If you remember these middle-period Beach Boys nuggets, ""Brother Years"" is a safe and prudent buy."
3,"""...a sorry excuse for a Beach Boys compilation.""","If it wasn't so inexpensive, I'd call ""Best of the Brother Years"" a sorry excuse for a Beach Boys compilation. Where's Johnny Carson, Solar System, All I Wanna do, Forever, For Once in My Life, etc, etc.? If we gotta have Bruce Johnston, Deidre is a much more personal, affecting song than the sappy Disney Girls. Just re-release the durned original albums, starting with Sunflower.Bob Rixon, WFMU"
3,Three Stars,"If you're a fan of the Beach Boys, then this is over the top material. The culmination of an ""Essential"" collection of their hits is found in volumes one and two. Either you like the Beach Boys, or you don't... if you do, then this is a must have CD for the avid fan."
1,Hits?,"Greatest HIts -- I don't think so.Top 10 hits? Few.Top 20 or even Top 40 hits? Again, few.Grocery store music remakes? Lots.Songs to skip? Again, lots.Who needed the money this cd was to produce?"
4,A chilling success in the horror realm!,"The author has a deep descriptive gift that drives this tale to the depths of imagination. One can't escape the effects, the story rivets the reader to the bitter end of an intense experience. Now the reader must ask: give us your next!"
4,kept me on the edge of my seat,"What a twisted mind. You never knew what was going to happen next. I hard a hard time putting the book down for fear I might miss something. This man has the mind of Steven King, they both have a way of making you always want more. If this is just a preview of his work to come, I will have my eyes wide open waiting for the next one."
5,"Simply ""Unforgettable""","It's a mystery to me why this album has so rarely been in print, especially in the USA. Johnny teams up with the daughter of Nat King Cole (although it's fair to say that she is pushed out of the limelight on the CD rather) to produce one of the best CD's I've ever heard. When you consider how definitive some of Nat King Cole's records are, just to tackle them requires bravery. But to pull off some of the most sensitive renditions of ""Stardust"", ""Unforgettable"" and ""When I Fall in Love"" ever heard, and in virtually the next breath to swing it harder than Sinatra with songs such as ""Orange Coloured Sky"" and the stunning medley is just incredible. To me, this is the utter highlight of Johnny Mathis's career - an under appreciated classic which stays true to the Cole spirit whilst injecting individuality into the performance."
4,Import,Tracks 1. Feel the Pain (4:14) 2. Get Out Of This (No Words Just Solo 5:25) 3. Repulsion (Acoustic Live at CBGB's 2:42)
3,Design is the strong point,"Pros-This shredder will take care of credit cards and up to seven sheets at once.-The crosscut function guarantees that your documents cannot be read after shredding.-Comes with a power button that is disabled when the shredder is not mounted on the basket.-It looks pretty good compared to most shredders out there.-Fairly priced.Cons-Will shut itself off if shredding continuosly for more than a couple of minutes. This is a safety feature to prevent overheating, but can be annoying if you have a large stack of paper to shred.-The shredder (top) could fit on the basket more tightly.-Having to remove the top to take the trash out of the basket can be a little inconvenient. Some models will have a basket that you can simply slide out without dismounting anything."
2,Noisy. Dead in a year. 7 sheets? Of what?,"Bought the Royal CC75 about a year ago. At that time it was $30 more than now.It shreds paper well enough, but it's very prone to jams from about 3 pages on up. 7 sheets of rice paper, maybe.The sensor that detects the presence of paper is not very sensitive, so you have to poke the paper around the throat until it notices and starts its roar and clatter.Some reviewer back at the time I bought it said it was quiet. It's not; it's vacuum-cleaner loud. I wonder if that other reviewer was using one of those cardboard box crushers you see on loading docks before this...Yes, it'll shred a credit card. From the sound it makes, you're never quite sure if it's going to finish, jam, or fly to pieces. It makes it, in the end. Very dramatic.After about a year, it simply stopped working. At first I felt cheated but then, I felt relieved.Not recommended."
3,"OK shredder not really crosscut, finally died","We use a shredder a lot in our home, and this one replaced an earlier small shredder that died. This one lasted about 1 1/2 years. Not really sure why it's called a crosscut, as it shreds in strings like all the rest. Finally started ""semi-shredding"" and oil, cleaning, running backwards didn't help."
5,Why buy an expensive inverter generator ?,"been using the voltage regulator for 2 years now on a 1200 watt ETO generator. No issues with a Dish TV HD receiver, an LCD tv or a 1080i home theater projector. The only way to use a conventional generator with electronics."
5,Excellent book,Absolutely fascinating account of the power struggle between Great Britain and Russia in Asia. What I loved the most is that author talks about the big picture through the small pictures of those who were participating in the Great Game and their fates.
3,Not as good as I expected,"Pros: Very readible. Easy to read and structured in an enjoyable manner.Cons:1. Unbalanced view through a biased Western observer. Atrocities committed by western forces are gleamed over. Eg. USA's interest currently in central Asia is described as ""seeks to nurture stability in this volatile region."" Oil and gas and geopolitics with China and Russia have nothing to do with it?2. No references in the text, and only few quotations. This makes the book have no scholarly value.3. Very few Eastern sources are used. Very few Russian sources are used."
4,Riveting historical narrative,Despite Hopkirk's occasional cloying English jingoism I stillcouldn't put this book down. A fascinating account of alittle-known conflict in the last great colonial struggle.
5,The Great Game,"As a new Great Game seems to be playing itself out in Central Asia, Peter Hopkirk's book takes on increased relevance. It is especially useful as a primer for anyone interested in the region or who might find themselves there. For those unfamiliar with the struggle, the book reads like fiction. I found myself constantly wondering what happened next. It is a great story of conflict and exploration."
4,BUYER BEWARe,"This is EXACTLY THE SAME book as ""The Great Game: The Struggle for Empire in Central Asia"" but with a different title, cover and publisher."
3,Good book but tedious to read,"This is a great book if you want to know about the history of the Central Asian region. The political struggles are still relevant today. However, it is really tedious to read because it is full of facts and names. It's not really a page turner. There's also nothing about modern day Central Asia. If you want to read a great fiction/thriller that accurately captures Uzbekistan's culture and people and presents the region through an entertaining story, read The Opportunists by Yohann de Silva. Here's a link to the book on Amazon:The Opportunists: A Novel"
2,More Tedium From Peter Hopkirk,"""Reads like a novel"" ??? Come on, folks! The yellow pages of any phone book are far more exciting. This text takes a subject of great potential, & reduces it to the dried up dust of a Central Asian desert. I am disgusted with Mr. Hopkirk, because I truely love real History. This author is only one of the sorry crowd who destroy interest in even the most eager seeker. Our schools are full of them. This text belongs to the times when books were sold by the pound, rather than the content. As a former teacher - & lifelong seeker after the amazing truths of history - I consign Mr. Hopkirk to the dust bin."
4,"Well written account of the ""first Cold War""","""The Great Game"" is an enjoyable read and the 600 pages go surprisingly quickly. I read this as background for an upcoming trip to the region and from the perspective of the post-Cold War era, it's amazing how so many dynamics of the Cold War were in place over 100 years earlier. The chess moves of the British and the Russians and the many intrepid ""explorers"" provide plenty to hold the reader's interest. I would have given it 5 stars, but the references aren't well tied to the text, so it's unclear to the lay man how to evaluate the scholarship. Hopkirk certainly has a track record, however, there always are disputes in the attempt to piece together history."
3,Decent but not great...,"These boots are ok. They are not very comfortable at first, but once broken in are pretty comfortable. They are waterproof, and have good traction. After only about 9 months of moderate use, the rubber on the front has began to separate from the leather. Also inside, the cloth at the heel has worn through. Not as durable as I had hoped, but not bad."
3,Not a fan.,"I love 5.11's stuff, but they need to do some work on their boots. These boots were not comfortable at all. I really just didn't like them. 5.11 was great about the return though, and fully refunded my money. Thumbs up to them for that. They haven't lost a customer. I still love their clothes, belts, packs, and other products."
4,Good For Work or Life,"With this book, John Adams gives us principles and practices that can serve us not only in our professional lives but in our personal lives as well. In fact, Adams recognizes that there should indeed be no separation of values between life and work, and offers what amounts to a handbook of spiritual practice for our whole selves."
5,Inspiring!,"John Adams tells an honest story of how he overcame obstacles, within and without, to create a successful business. He has the courage to use his failures as lessons and the confidence to use his accomplishments as inspiration to help us create a system for success grounded in spiritual principles. Miracles at Work is a lesson in growing, not only a business but also a more fulfilling life."
5,Miracles at Work: Building Your Business From the Soul Up,"I loved reading the book, Miracles at Work. I found it to be inspiring, practical, and entertaining. The author has a talent for storytelling, and within the storytelling a spiritual message is conveyed to the reader. It is a message of hope and a message that leaves you feeling as if anything is possible! Although it is a lofty book, it is written in a very down to earth and simple style that is refreshing. It offers sound practical advice that anyone can use in their daily experience. If every business and every person in America read this book, the world would be a better place!"
1,Do you miss Nuns w/ Rulers?,"If you miss having Nuns (or teachers) wrap your knuckles with rulers, this is the teapot for you; The large plastic non-movable handle and the too tight fitting lid will delight you every time you wish to refill the pot. You get the added bonus of looking tough drinking your tea with convincing black and blue marks this teapot endows. Poorly constructed, poorly designed, but it comes in stainless steel and an assortment of colors."
1,Rusty!,"The only redeeming feature of this kettle is how fast it will boil water.It's a bad sign when the owner's manual includes instructions on how to get rid of the rust spots that will develop on the inside of the teakettle if you don't dry it between each and every use. I drink a lot of tea and coffee, so that's really just not practical.It's impossible to get water into this thing because the handle is rigid and does not move from side to side like most good teakettles.The whistle is so noisy and piercing that it feels like my ears are going to bleed every time it goes off.Oh, and did I mention the rust spot? I only got my money's worth because I got 4 free coffee mugs with this kettle when I bought it. There's nothing worse than having to throw out what seems from the outside to be a perfectly good thing.Spend more on something that will last a lifetime."
1,Melting,This tea kettle's whistle melted and warped during use after only three weeks. We did follow directions using only medium heat. We are using A viking gas range. I would not recommend using this product on gas ranges.
1,Spend Your Money Elsewhere,"Poorly made with carbon steel fasteners which rust. Non-metalic parts,like the spout cover, are not heat proof. Yes, they do melt. The spout cover hinge design is very poor. The hinge is weak and will break with the slightest side force when the spout is open. It's best to avoid cookware made in Thailand. On the plus side, it does have a substantial whistle."
2,Not so much ...,"I was caught by the ""customers who bought _____ also bought Riverside, and since I'm a big prog rock fan, I ordered it without hearing it. My mistake, the cd is average at best, and rather boring overall"
3,A DECEPTION,"Sorry, I expected much more from this group. It was my first Riverside album, and I had read a lot of excellent ratings from everyone here. There's no comparizon with P. TREE or PINK FLOYD or PENDRAGON."
4,A similar band to Porcupine Tree,Another great album by Riverside. I found this band by lack. I was hoping to find something like Porcupine tree and i hit the jack-pot. THis group is very similar to Porcupine tree (moste to their last albums). They play lets say psychedelic progressive metal. I found the combination very dynamic and they succeed in the end. The result is magical music with really great vocals.
4,Adult Contemporary Metal?,"That's the best way I can describe this album: Adult Contemporary Metal. It was recommended to me after purchasing In Absentia by Porcupine Tree. In fact, it sounds a lot like Porcupine Tree, but with some 1980's Pink Floyd and late 70's Tangerine Dream mixed in. Also, there are hints of Tool. It's an interesting combination of sounds that never quite reaches full-fledged Metal, in my opinion. It's too melodic to be Metal, and also, too progressive to be radio friendly. And yet it's not meandering enough to be considered progressive rock. Whatever it is, I like it."
3,Well-crafted prog,"A very good album, with some intense, edgy songs and a couple of quiet tracks that kind of fade into the background. You'd never know these guys were from Poland, as they sound like American bands like Enchant and Iluvatar."
4,Metal Prog from a different angle,The first thing that hit me was the quality of the vocals by Duda. He reminds me of John Wetton and he isn't afraid to experiment with it as he does on the opening cut. This isn't what I expected but that's a good thing. The music here is dark and moody but very melodic and memorable. The ethnic classical music influences are prevalent but help to create a very unique style of progressive rock. The only real criticism I have is that the drums get buried in the mix from time to time and that really detracts from the dynamics of certain songs. But these guys are young and future releases will hopefully correct that oversight. For now they have provided us with an album that intrigues and entertains on many levels.
4,Good! not GREAT,"This band tends to get A LOT of hype- these albums are good, yes, but 5 stars? C'mon!A nice, prog rock albums, good songs, but nothing that you've never heard.A lot seems left over from their previous record, but that is not necesarily a bad thing.Good CD- but not the best."
4,Great follow up to an excellent debut,"Wonderful band out of Poland. I do have a few minor detractions to this album (as well as their last one); 1) I think with a little bit better mix and master these guys could really break very well into North America. 2) I could easily do without the opening 35-40 sec. of whispering. If the album had started right away with the beautiful a-capella that is the opening track ""After"", easily could've developed a much more receptive mood from the listener IMO. Highly recommended."
3,Not quite what I expected....,"....which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I heard a couple of tracks from Riverside on internet radio, which lead me to buy this disc. About 3/4 of the songs I really like, but a bit of the music is too hard with a lot of dark imagery for my tastes. No question about the band's talent, just not quite my cup of tea. I will continue to listen and see if it becomes an aquired taste for me."
3,MOS does it again...???,"With all the hype surrounding this release, because of the stellar combo of DJ's doing the mix, it seemed like a no-brainer to get this one, BUT it seemed like the mixes got less interesting with each passing of the torch. Little Louie's mix was done immaculately, however the tracks were remneince of many other compilations on the market. Tony's mix wasn't as common, but the ""garaginess"" of that set sounded a little forced, last time I heard Tony wasn't only about vocals. Tedd's mix was too laid back and self-indulgent to have any effect and bored me.I'll still hold on to this one, for Tony's sake, he's my fave outta the bunch :)"
3,Bad product,I got this product a week ago and I haven't been able to get a signal from my computer with it. Instead it picks up TV transmissions!!! I can hear the audio from TVs.
4,Great Product / Avoid when Wet.,"This is an excellent, but overpriced product! This product lets you play music from your computer to your FM Radio on any stereo! This product is a system that comes with two units a transmitter that you plug into your computer that transmits a radio signal to the receiver up to 1000 feet away! This receiver sits near your stereo up to 10 feet away from it and can even be plugged into the stereo directly. No additional equipment / computer components / technical experience are needed, just plug the transmitter into your computer's soundcard and sit the receiver near your stereo. The two units are small a little bigger than a man's fist. There are drawbacks however, such as rain, if there is a rain or haze around your house, it will not work at all! Also this item is very overpriced considering that back in the 70s people used this same system to transmit a microphone to an FM radio for only $20."
2,Great concept...fails to live up to its promise,"I was ecstatic when I first got it - worked great and provided something I'd been wanting for years. The joy was short lived. Started getting funky background noise. Then it stopped working for days at a time. But the worst was when it started cutting out. I'd be in the middle of a great song, and all of a sudden some hispanic radio station would cut in for 10 seconds. Now it starts up doing that and doesn't stop for hours.I tried all the different settings, channels; moved it to different locations; added an additional receiver to strengthen the signal - nothing. Thought maybe it was where I lived, but when I moved over the summer the problem followed. Customer service is almost non-existent - I got one email response that didn't really answer my question and then never heard from them again.Wish it wasn't true, but this product just isn't worth the frustration. When it works, I love it, but the majority of the time it doesn't."
3,No customer support,"I purchased this product about 4-5 years ago and it has worked fine. One receive unit recently developed a problem which I believe requires repair. Per their instructions, I sent several emails to their customer service department requesting instructions as to how to have the unit repaired. I have not received one reply to my requests. After sending several emails, I must conclude that their customer service department no longer exists. Buy this unit at your own risk as I would no longer anticipate any assistance from this company. Very disappointed."
2,"Sweeten your Life the Xylitol Way, not a Low-Carb book","I have Xylitol and enjoy using it to make desserts. So imagine my surprise, after reading the glowing reviews, and receiving my book, Sweeten Your Life The Xylitol Way, that the recipes were high in carbohydrates. The book might be great for someone that is cooking for Diabetics. Maybe that is what it was designed for. But I just thought, if there are any other people out there looking for Low-Carb desserts, I do not feel this is the book you are looking for. Just FYI."
1,Caution,Inventive book just make sure your system can handle Xylitol first though as I had a severs reaction to the stuff
2,Does not stay on the window well,Not very good at blocking out sun. If you want it for looks that's about the only benefit. With a clean window and all it always seemed to come off.
1,Is is a book?,"I was expencting a book the same size as the book by Lee Strobel The Case for Christ. This is only a pocket sized book, and only exerpts from The case for Christ. I feel totally ripped off. I won't buy another book at this site."
2,Read the Bible,"Most believers (and non-believers) would gain greater benefit from reading the actual passages in the Bible than this booklet's summarizations and explanations.Furthermore, the use of Easter in evangelization seems a little ironic to me. Easter is a pagan holiday renamed in the latter days of the Roman Empire in an effort to ""convert"" many pagans to Christianity and resulted in the Church being populated with many false believers. The original Easter celebrated the God of Fertility, hence the eggs and bunnies -- neither of which have anything to do with the resurrection of Jesus."
5,Fabulous Book Supporting the Resurrection!,"Lee Strobel, a former athiest who sets out to discount the livin Christ, in the end finds Him, and in this book presents powerful physical evidence of the resurrection! A great gift for the skeptic!"
1,"It's pretty, but....","I've discovered several problems with this kettle: it dribbles when you pour; the handle is set too far forward, causing the steam to burn your hand; the plastic on the lid is sharp (I've cut myself twice); and it's difficult to clean grease off the enamelled part.It's definitely not worth the price."
1,unhappy,I bought the ultimo tea kettle and i am very disappointed with it. The main reson I bought it was for the whistle. The whistle is so weak the only way you can hear it is to stand right next to it. I wanted a whistling tea kettle to prevent it from being left on and burning off. This one does not do that. Thankyou for your time.
3,Copco Odyssey Teakettle,"We received our Copco Oddyssey teakettle within five days of order, and at a price that was approximately five dollars less than at the local store. We are very pleased with the service, as well as the teakettle which is a top quality item."
3,teakettle too hot,"I had trouble finding a cobalt blue teakettle, so when I found it on Amazon.com I was thrilled.The teakettle is the right color and size; however,it has one major flaw. When it whistles, the handle is so hot that you need to use a potholder while holding the handle to pour."
1,the company not the music,"I am looking for opportunities to review Bra Smyth, the company. I really know nothing about this music. Bra Smyth sells bras (obviously) and other underthings online, through catelogs, and at stores in NY and NJ. Their products seem to be quite good, but their customer service is BAD. Specifically, in my case, they refused to refund the TAX collected on returned and cancelled items. TAX, not shipping and handling. I don't think this is legal, let alone fair."
2,There are better videos out there.,"My 3 year old likes the Discovery Little People videos, and for the most part I don't mind them. I do wish they had some sort of teaching value, like Veggie Tales. (One story's moral was Eddie learned he could jump as high as a frog and Freddie learned he could jump as high as a cloud. Not much of a point.) One good thing my son is learning from these vidoes is the difference between real and make believe. (I.e. Michael makes the zoo train fly, my son always announces at that point, ""Trains can't fly, that's just pretend."") If I could change one thing about these vidoes, it would be the guy singing the theme song. His voice is truely obnoxious. My son got this video as a gift, I wouldn't ever buy one. There are better videos out there that are more educational as well as entertaining. (Veggie Tales, Clifford the Big Red Dog, and Sesame Street, to name a few.)"
3,There is better,"I enjoyed this book but found 'Life and Death on the Internet' by Keith Schroeder to be more useful, informitive and interesting. Personally, I would pass on this book and get Mr. Schroeder's."
4,They should have taken out net-sex (it's obsolete),"The part on net-crime was great since it showed history, ethics, pyschology and the zen of hacking itself. i was hoping that the coverage could have been broader, but the book was halfed into net-sex where it talked about BBS pr0n which is kinda dead nowadays.Nonetheless, a good book if you're towards the history and the sense of hackers. But if you're looking for technical stuff, uhmm, better turn your back. The book is not for those wanting to learn, or is in search of technical knowledge. The book is for critics, professors, and the mass who don't understand what hacking is all about."
4,A Good Read For Those Interested In Freedom of Speech,"An interesting book that presents the ""freedom issues"" surrounding censorship of the Net. I found it food for thought because it presented several issues that may not be so obvious to those who are concerned about Libertarian concepts. Interesting, educational and inspiring."
1,"Nothing to do with ""anarchy online""","Platt's book caters to people who subscribe to stereotypes about the Internet. The main problem with this book is it's misleading title: ""Anarchy Online."" It totally leaves out all of the online content being created by anarchists today, especially the hundreds of really useful websites. Platt should stick to fiction, although this book could be classified as fiction."
1,I don't like the pronograghic issueses of this book!,This book deals to much with pornograghy. Even though it raises intersting points about the freedom of the internet. Still this book is evil since I'm a very religos person. This book is evil in that it deals with the freedom to post porno on the internet. I think this book is bad and should not be viewed by anyone. I think that this book should be band from all book stores. I wonce again hate this book. By the way I'm 13 years old.
3,Great camera except...,"I like the Nikon a great deal except for one fatal design blunder, totally unexpected from a company with Nikon's reputation. The optional lenses block most of the view finder when they're in use. As the representative told me, you must use the LCD monitor when using the optional telephoto lens (and apparently other lenses and digital cameras). Unfortunately, the LCD monitor is virtually useless in dim lighting or bright sun. So this is a very serious design error. I can recommend this camera only if you never intend to use the optional lens."
4,This camera does the job like few other digital cameras.,"The Nikon Coolpix 800 is hard to beat. It's easy to use, produces great quality photos and the price is second to none.I have tried other digital cameras -- Kodak, Olympus, Sony, and more expensive Nikons -- and this one is by far the most impressive. I use the camera for newspaper and magazine work, and am quite happy. So is my editor.To save batteries, I turn the LDC monitor off, except for a brief viewing. And, I purchased a PCMCI adapter, which enables me to read the photos very quickly. This makes downloading the photos much more simple and less time consuming.There are a few minor problems with the camera. The biggest is that the zoom is disappointing compared to other mega pixel cameras -- even with the optional teleconverter lens. Here's why: The converter blocks the viewfinder, forcing the photographer to use the LCD monitor, which means batteries don't last as long.Still, I'm pleased with the purchase."
2,cool camera with a few kinks,"Wow, those pictures are really cool. Have it for a few days now and mainly made different pictures in automatic setting. I bought the camera for it's awsome picture quality and so far it delivers. As others have said before, there are a few kinks you will have to live with, if you go for Nikon's entry level: 1) flimsy covers for battery/smartcard/lens 2) this thing eats up batteries, get lots of NiMH rechargables. (the batteries that came with the camera were empty after shooting 15 pictures and downloading them to PC) When you turn the camera on, the LCD monitor turns on and the camera is in constant metering/focusing mode. So, running around like that for a while, eats up batteries even more. If you don't want to use the monitor, you have to turn it off when you switch the camera on.Summary: great pictures for a decent price, if you can live with the above."
2,Nikon Coolpix == Slowpix,"Nikon Coolpix 800 has two shortcomings:1. The flash is terrible. Almost always, the flash shots come out with the subject bright in the center and the backround completely dark. It looks like a metering/exposure problem.2. The camera is slow. I take a lot of pictures of moving objects, my kids etc. Almost all moving shots, the camera takes the picture a second or so later than the actual shot which means I missed the shot.If you don't take a lot of pictures with flash or moving objects, this is a great camera. For me, I went and bought an Olympus C2000Z. Works great, and has 3x zoom to boot."
1,Poor luck so far with the coolpix800,"I recently purchased my first digital camera, a Coolpix 800 (Not from Amazon). I couldn't get it to focus. At a camera shop they pointed out to me that the lens was in crooked. I bought another from the camera shop and returned the first one.To my dismay, when starting this one up I got a 'system error'. I called the camera shop and they stepped me through a card--formating exercise, still no luck.Finally I called the Nikon factory snd told a gal my problem. She kind of laughed and said ""Oh, send it back"".I'm now, being 0 for 2, looking at another brand.Thank you, Clair"
1,Maybe this time the review will shoow up,"... I got the camera and first time out of the box it had a system error. No problem I figure, call Nikon and get it fixed... Now that I actually have a working camera it has it shortcomings, eats batteries, hesitation after you click and other annoying quirks. However after I got more memory it actually takes great pixs. I would NOT buy it again after going through all the nightmare with Nikon. Maybe after a few months with it working properly I might change my tune."

5,satisfied,"I,M HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT. I HAD A LEARNING CURVE WITH THE REWIND BUT I GOT IT NOW. IT MEETS MY NEEDS..."
3,Decent Purchase,"This was a decent purchase, the sink is very handy and works quite well.The assembly went fairly well, the only issue was the o-ring in the drain was damaged during factory assembly. The o-ring in the faucet assembly was also damaged during assembly,it needed lubricant prior to the assembly. It should have mentioned this in the directions, consequently they needed to be replaced. The o-ring damage was obvious when you apply water pressure, it of course leaked. Other than this, all is fine."
4,Hose Reel + sink,this is a really cool tool for your yard - highly recommended - great for elderly and children
5,great device at a great price,"very well designed and made, looks great tooI will be ordering another one to put out by the garden!"
2,Risky and Spurty,"Great product design, but only if used really cautiously, especially with children around, while windingYou can actually get your hand pinched really bad between the reel and frame, when the reel is winding under water pressure if you try to inadvertantly put your hand in to untangle or direct the pipe.The sink is working really weird for me - when I swing the lever to turn on the faucet, there is a spurt of water from the drain hole for some reason. Any tips on perhaps what I might be doing incorrectly?"
1,junk,This product is junk.The manufacturer sold to another co.When I called for warrentee help I got no responce.It has been ovwr a month since the purchase and I'm stilltrying to get some help.I recomend not buying this product or any watered powered productfrom this co.Poorly made piece of plastic that leaks all over the place since day one.
3,No Crank Outside garden sink.,The item I ordered was not shipped. I ordered the No Crank Outdoor Sink Station with Water Powered Retractable Garden Hose Reel. What I received was the No Crank Outdoor Sink Station without the water powered retractable reel. With the Help of Mr. Kleber I was able to return the wrong item.I have reordered the item I wanted through Amazon.com.
5,outside sink sk2415001,"The sink assy was easy to assemble and the autorewind does work very well, but I suggest putting small screws at each anchor point ""where the pieces slide togather"" so that they dont come apart when ever you need to lift it for some reason or an other. Also when liding the faucet into its place, some sort of lubricant must be used to prevent the ""O"" ring seal from coming off and causing a bad water leak.Otherwise we are very happy with it.Thank you."
3,reelsmart sink unit,"Received item in approximatley 1 week. When assembling unit found piece broken. Contacted ReelSmart and was told that the part was not a stocked part but was part of the sink itself. They said that a part would be sent in 1-2 weeks and if the part itself could not be sent that they would send another sink unit. After 2 weeks, contacted the company to follow up on why I had not recieved the part. Was told it was not in stock and they expected an order this week and if the part was not in the order they would send me another sink unit. Still waiting...."
4,No Crank Outdoor Sink,"The reason for the 4 stars is, that sometimes when it is supposed to wind itself back up, it needs assistance, causing me to get my hands dirty, and having to fight my dog on the other end (she pulls at the hose when I wind it). Other than that, I guess it serves its' purpose. I would purchase it again, if that helps anyone make up their mind. After all, I'm at a sink where I can easily wash off."
4,light weight sink,"This sink arrived pretty late in the season and we didn't get use it all that much. It is very lightweight and needed to be tied for stability. Our is placed on a rooftop deck where it is fairly windy. Caution should be used when pushing the faucet in place during assembly, otherwise the washer may disengage causing leaking when you use it. The hose rewind function works perfectly!All in all it is a very useful item, I would recommend this item."
4,Sink review-it works pretty well!,"After they destroyed our kitchen for remodeling, we purchased the outdoor sink to do dishes, etc. The set-up went resonable well...be careful on looking at the pictures to get the legs installed properly.The use is like a sink, albeit with only cold water. The hose does work but I would not install the maximum length hose as on a similar device by the same company it jammed. I went a little shorter to insure smooth roll ups.All in all I would purchase the product again."
1,Reel Useless,"This is one of the few Amazon purchases I have been completely disappointed with. The product is very cheaply made, lightweight and with parts fabricated from very thin plastic that I don't believe will hold up to any actual outdoor - or even indoor - usage. After putting it together, I realized that it had been oversold in the descriptions and reviews (written by company employees?) on the Amazon site. So this is one that went back right away. If priced around $40, with free shipping, it may be worth taking a chance on if you reeeely need something as irrelevant as this to replace the good ol' hose and bucket. But at $80-plus as a Gold Box 'deal,' it was still way overpriced. At over $100, it's outrageously overpriced."
4,Handy workstation,"The setup on this unit was very easy and I was able to assemble it within 15 minutes. It has proved to be a a very very useful item on my back patio. The lever in the sink lets me switch from hose to sink spout function quickly. That is one of the drawbacks. You can only use one or the other. The cord rewinding feature is also great. I used to really hate having to gather and wind the cord by hand, b/c I would get all of the dirt and gunk that the hose would pick up from off of the ground. One advice I would give is that the water output hoses for the pressure winding system needs to be laid flat and not curled or kinked. The back pressure that results causes it to blow right off of the attachment, sending water everywhere."
2,Average moisturizing creme,This moisturizing creme is good but I had better. There is really nothing special about this brand of vitamin E creme. Maybe I expected more. Would I buy this creme again? Maybe....Maybe not. I would look for something else.
5,Recommended,"You certainly won't find any fluff in this book. It is not, as suggested by another reviewer, written in early modern English, but in thoroughly modern English. The prose is a bit stiff and formal, almost academic (which is consistent with its publication date), but entirely readable. There are a few quotes and poems in original languages which are not translated.These problems aside, for anyone truly interested in the origins of how we celebrate various ""festivals"" this time of year, this book is indispensable. I actually found the second part of the book, dealing with pagan rituals and festivals, to be the most interesting; it is fascinating to me how these practices, some thousands of years old, have survived to this day in various forms in different parts of the world.The origins of Christmas are dealt with in a very straightforward, dispassionate way."
3,"Quality, But Difficult, Read","This books will offer an excellent overview of Christmas if you can get through the prose. Written in a by-gone time, this book may challenge readers.If you can get through the awardness of the writing style, please prepare for Christmas treat!"
3,For a Friend,"I purchased this dvd for a friend of mine. He likes that form of martial arts. I did see the dvd, it was goofy. The fighting was ok."
2,Have a barf bag ready,"The 'sister' in the title is actually a sister-in-law. During the Huguenot wars in France (the late 1500s), Philander married Myrtilla and then ran off with her sister Sylvia. These letters are between Philander and Sylvia, and at first they are thoroughly nauseating. They're loaded with trembling sighs and heaving bosoms and anguished glances, and frequent uses of Oh! and Alas! This goes on for hours. Things improve in the second half of the book, as the previous reviewer describes. I recommend doing a lot of skimming until you notice the exclamation points reducing in frequency, and then the characters start to mature a little."
1,Of all the Alaska wilderness books I've read...,"The Coldman Cometh was advertised by Amazon as a new release and I've read a ton of these Alaska wilderness books so I tried it. Well I was most dissappointed, of all the authors, many of whom where ""uneducated"", I've always been satisfied but usually impressed. However, this author with all his credentials is full of himself. Very little of the material is focused on the wilderness adventure but rather on a displaced, pot smoking hippie with an ego. If your looking for the romance of Alaska wilderness homesteading and lifestyle don't look here. This author is purely trying to make a quick buck."
4,A very readable and fascinating story of the Alaska wilds,"This book has particular appeal to those who have visited Alaska and were impressed by the awesome beauty of the wilderness. Bob Durr's book is very readable - it holds your interest through an descriptive storytelling style. Occasionally the philosophizing gets a little tiresome, but then we are back to the story line and things move along briskly. I think Durr's characterizations of the people are particularly effective and help you to visualize each scene as it unfolds. He also incorporates passages written by his sons, Steve and Jon. In summary, I enjoyed the book and plan to read Durr's other book about Alaska!"
3,Hope you have the time to put this one together,"I've put a lot of furniture together. This one had me thinking it might be better to buy already assembled furniture. The piece went together okay, but the top was almost impossible to get seated correctly. If this is your first assembly, make sure you have someone with you who has experience and patience. It looks good once complete, but not a fine piece of furniture. Good for a den."
4,Really nice for the price,"I love the style of this buffet table. Took my husband about and hour and half to put it together and it's now holding our 55"" TV on it until it goes up on the wall. Really good for a good price."
4,Postmodern Kettle - Add Style to your Kitchen,"This stainless steel teakettle is a beauty. It looks elegant no matter which angle you look at it. The quality and craftmanship is high and really shows on the shiny finish. The large opening makes it really easy to add water and not to say that it allows you to stick your hand inside for cleaning. The whistling sound when water boils is also music to the ears. However, its ""stay-cool handle"" does not actually stay cool. It gets quite warm when water boils. However this does not reduce my enthusiasm for this teakettle. You always want to be careful around a hot kettle anyways. My verdict for this product: This stylish kettle ROCKS."
4,New Millennium Dreampop,"The problem with early-to-mid 90s dreampop was, mesmerizing as those sonic explorations were, the music was emotionally distant. You responded intellectually, enjoying the triumph of melody over noise. In some cases, you'd learn to love it - Sonic Youth's A Thousand Leaves and My Bloody Valentine's Loveless are highwater marks - but most of it was more trouble than pleasure (Spacemen 3 and others I can't recall). Six by Seven traffic in new millennium dreampop, but they make a deep, hard rocking impression. The Closer You Get, their second release, betters their first with varied tempos, sharper songs, more orchestrated clatter. Two songs are genre masterpieces: the gothic ""Ten Places to Die"", the roiling ""My Life Is an Accident"". When they can't get their songwriting in order, they do the next best thing: they rave, which usually counts for something."
5,Viewmaster a great toy,This is just like the one I had as a child and the one my children had as a child. It held my grandson's interest and he loved it!
5,ViewMaster Classic Model L 3D Blue Viewer,"Excellent service, prompt delivery, excellent conditonas described, packaged well.Would use again."
4,Classic,"I got this for my children for Christmas. I bought extra ""reels"" for them (Thomas the Train and Toy Story). They liked it as much as my wife and I!! I can see they are going to be hard on the reels (my kids are 3 and 5) but for the price, I am well pleased."
4,GREAT Timeless toy,"It is just as fun for my grandson who used it a lot,as it was for me 50 yrs ago as a child,some toys are just great ideas,this is one of them>Marvin"
4,Old time idea great new idea,"Had these as a kid, of course they weren't in 3D but still spent hours with these. My 4 year old grandson liked it too. Don't suppose he will spend as many hours and I did with it but it was a hit."
2,Distorts pictures,"I'm not sure what the problem is with this viewer, but every reel I put in it is hard to see. I've cleaned the front lenses, and they are not the problem. The middle of each picture has a funny grainy distortion to it."
5,Classic and still great!,"I still remember the wonder I felt when I would look at the images and secret worlds within my own ViewMaster Viewer when I was a child. Now I am a mother and a grandmother, and I still enjoy looking at these little wheels of wonder!I purchased this ViewMaster to serve as our second viewer, so that my two grandsons can both be searching these enchanting worlds at the same time. Now Grandma gets to look at each picture with each child simultaneously! Which means twice the viewing pleasure!I would highly recommend this quality product, sold by a quality seller. Enjoy your past with your children/grandchildren today!"
4,In-Depth Look at Famous Disaster,"Ah, back to the Hindenburg, the disaster that claimed few lives but played out so spectacularly it burned its image into our minds. Mooney's book looks at the event, giving us a brief history of the airship followed by a comprehensive account of the ship's last flight to New York. No airship enthusiast will be bored by this book. It is well written, despite the author's annoying tendency to start each chapter commenting on the sun's indifference to the human clock or calender. My only problem with the book was its contention that the explosion was an act of sabotage by one of the riggers. This idea is not new, and could of course be true, but I believe the evidence suggests a natural cause. Why do so many feel that arson and sabotage are necessary ingredients to a good disaster story? But this detracts little from the work. I recommend it to Hindenburg junkies and aviation historians."
2,Disappointing look at the Hindenburg disaster,"There are much better books on the subject of the Hindenburg disaster and the role it played in American/German history & pop culture. This speculative work takes a long time to get going and then, when it finally reaches the climax of the airship's demise, it is regrattably short on storytelling.Hindenburg enthusiasts will enjoy it, but should not be considered a definitive textbook."
4,Nirvana for information junkies,"Just about any 'ism' you can imagine has a breif description in Bothamley's compendium. It lists ideas from every academic pursuit throughout history and is very readable. The prose is obviously 'encylopedic,' that is, factual by point, point, and point. The entries are also very brief: 'Darwinism' receives as much ink as 'the hole theory of electrons.' Really a nice little book, though, with lots of information."
3,A Gluten Free Gift,"I bought these for our relatives, who have celiac disease, as an Easter treat because they are gluten free. We tried them, and we did not like the flavor very well. But our relatives who have celiac disease really loved them, and were extremely happy to receive them.They considered them a wonderful treat!"
3,Great for crust,I use this to make a great crust for pies & cake that need a chocolate crust or topping. works great and tast great to.
3,"Good workout, but poor quality","I loved the workout that this stepper gave me. It was quiet enough to use while watching TV. On the downside, the weld that holds the adjuster broke, rendering the unit useless. I doubt I have any recourse with the company as I bought it quite some time ago and no longer have any info on it."
5,Smells Smooth,"Amber, Oakmoss, Saffron, Patchouli, Orange, Coriander and Cedar. Makes for a perfect mixture with this fragrance."
4,silver shadow,I like the smell and it last almost all day.Great price and was received in excellent condition and in a reasonable time frame.
1,don't waste your $,"Poor animation, almost unintelligible audio. While the story lines are OK, they are incomplete. This is merely a teaser with shorts that are incomplete. It should be free since it's more of an ad than an event."
5,Great Cat Comb,My cats love being brushed with this and it is easy to handle. It removed more hair than any other brush I have used.
5,It works if you work it,"I got this little book, did what it said to do and noticed a immediate change in my thinking. I enjoyed smoking but in three short weeks I have stopped completely using the simple techniques.I am working on prosperity issues. Quitting smoking has saved me about $500 a year. Get the book and see your life change for the better on a daily basis."
4,pamphlet - it works,Great little pamphlet on the power of positive thinking. Any time I am feeling a little less than I want to - I just grab this tiny pamplet and pick a few pages to read. It lifts me right up. Helps me to remember I can go after what I want and I'm worth it.
1,Panders to the susceptible and unquestioning,"I won't waste more than a couple of lines critiquing a book that is basically a couple of lines. You can call it anything 'affirmation' 'positive thinking or any of a host of buzz words but basically concentrate of what you want like real hard like all the time and if it manifests 'cool' and if not 'oh,well'. This basic theorem has been around for time immemorial in many guises. Save the 3 bucks and bank it for your longed for BMW Roadster. Who knows what will happen after 36 years of your daily affirmations (and daily $3 tithings ). My girlfriend wanted this book to visualize herself in high-dollar S.F. area on an Arizona budget. If we hit the tele-transporter in the next couple of days, color me wrong.BTW, all the 'testimonials' at the end of the book appear not to exist on this earthly plane but may be there in some parallel universe. Googling them take you right to the 'It Works' webpage. Divine providence, perhaps?**Wish I could give it -5 stars**"
1,It didn't work,"Not only is the book tiny. It never really worked for me.Too bad, because a friend highly recommend it to me.Stop wasting time and money trying to make your dreams come true. Start with what's true and bring truth to your dreams."
1,It works for the author/publisher. It won't work for most readers.,"This is a tiny book, with a few pages, that all could be turned into a 2 page flyer and delivered by PDF download and you'd be done reading it in less than 5 minutes. To call it a book and require it to be shipped, is a price-ridden illusion that makes the sale of this book work. Ironically and coincidentally, it is the premise of the book to believe in the unbelievable. So, it works for the author/publisher."
3,THIS IS A PAMPHLET,"I just received my copy of ""IT WORKS""............I'm not being a Hater........and I was fully expecting a smaller book, a thin paperback even; yet its held together by TWO STAPLES.This is a PAMPHLET that has 28 small pages and it begins on page 5; after a copyright page, and several title pages.No, I've not read the ""book"" yet, and am fully prepared that it just might change my life when I do, but for all intents and purposes, it is NOT a book.It reminds me of a religious tract.So just be warned, it isn't a book, and if it inspires me to the stratosphere of achievement, I'll revisit this review.You can sense my moderate frustration in making the purchase, then paying shipping and handling for a.........pamphlet."
4,"Short, simple, and practical","While I believe positive thinking definitely has value, I'm not a big Law of Attraction person. That being said, I still found this book useful. As you've already seen in other reviews, this short book is summarized in three steps for achieving things:1) Write down exactly what you want.2) Think about it as much as you can as if it's already achieved.3) Don't talk to anyone about it until you have real-world results to share.I believe that these simple steps do help with making your dreams a reality, especially not talking about it until it's actually happening. I know too many people that do nothing but talk to others about their grandiose plans, but fail to take effective action on them. I've always been the opposite; I don't say anything to anyone about budding projects (except for maybe my wife and best friends) until they're actually up and running...and even then I'm not one to talk much about it."
4,I am working on it,"This is a short, easy to understand book, with great suggestions. I have nothing spectacular to report, but will continue working with it. If nothing else, it stimulates the mind and brings one closer to the inner-self."
1,Dangerous,"Yes, ""IT"" works, but if you're tempted to try, resist! It's not the ""Unified Field"" or the ""Cosmos"" that answers your request, but a far more sinister, demonic personality. You'll likely experience a string of fullfilled requests, but eventually, there's a price to pay: broken home, depression, drug addiction, miserable unhappiness - any number of possiblilies from a long list of the signs and symptoms of spiritual death."
3,Did it without this book but it's nice to read,"I read all the great reviews and was curious and purchased it here. Reading the reviews summed up what this little book is all about. If you want to save a few bucks then just read the reviews. It does work but my method was a little bit different.When I was in college, I wrote down everything I wanted after graduation such as buying a house, a sports car, a bank account with $XX, etc. Within 3 years after college, I found these notes which were stuck between some college papers and discovered that everything that was written, I had accomplished. I did not read this paper everyday or think about it as much as possible (per 'It Works'). I didn't tell anyone about these goals either, as I really forgot about it and others aren't really interested in what you want anyway (only you are)."
4,Love it,"I liked it so much, carry it with me at all times I will definetely share it with friends so Im ordering some more..."
4,A tiny book with powerful information.,"Very tiny book with one method of manifesting. Nothing new if you've read ""Think and Grow Rich"" or a variety of other manifesting books. However, it does cover one good method in a succint way. Good to have in your collection of this type of material. It's kind of sweet in its old-fashioned language."
5,Does it really work?,"Yes it does, and then some! I have read the book, made my lists, and watched them happen, one by one as I wrote them. Amazing - the power of our thoughts and actions. I shared it with my 9 year old son and he has made his own list. We bought ten copies and gave them out to friends and family... we wish you all the very best!!! It Works!"
3,Good for beginners,"This little book nibbles at some Universal Truths. Its like a primer for stepping into the realm of creative possibility. There are many, many books now, that are much more advanced, like the Abraham/Hicks books, and Wayne Dyer, and a Course in Miracles...but this little book is a good place to get one's feet wet in the world of Potential."
3,"""It only works if you (I) make it work!""","Great advice in a very few pages. This book contains obvious information and positive rhetoric. It's really a handy little travel companion. If you really want a useful book, read; ""As A Man Thinketh"", ""Acres of Diamonds"" or, ""I Dare You"". All of these are small, concise scripts, with a lot more clout!"
4,A good gag gift that just might pay off!,"Rather than spend a few dollars on lottery tickets, check out the odds on the program described in this book. It's really more like a pamphlet. Positive thinking never hurt anybody! A good little gift to stick into a birthday card for friends or relatives."
1,I was thinking I am buying a book not a booklet!,"I was badly surprised to find out it is so small and miserable. I was thinking I am buying a book, not a booklet. If is so simple why you guys do not write it with one sentence and send it by e-mail, so no postal costs are on the way? I can not believe I did pay six dollars for this! I will deffinitely avoid to buy anything from these source again!"
2,waste of money,This book does not say much and it is based on three lines. The book is like 3 pages and you can get it on your search engine for free.
1,Don't waste your time,Used this book as a filler to get free shipping. I'm not sure why in the product details the book is indicated as having 256 pages. It has about 30 . It is essentially what should be a free handout. It is also very dated seeming like it was written in the 50's. Just read a couple of the reviews and you have all the information contained within the book.
4,Only The Facts...,"I have read the original It Works and met people have succesfully applied the principles out-pictured in this little, but very profound book. Don't let the small size of the book to fool you, this is without a doubt one of the best books available.The reason why I like this book is the fact that it presents an easy concept that anyone can follow -- and beat the odds, negative feelings and self-doubts. Certainly worth the few bucks.The key to success is simple, and this book proves it. However, I would recommend two books to be read along this one. One of them is Being The Solution and the other is Immortal Man."
2,available free by googling,"This is a tiny booklet, with one basic idea: write down what you want, and review it daily. Good idea- but you could fit this one one page."
3,"It was ok, a little short.",When ordering this book i knew it was going to be shorter then other visualization books but this was really short. Its pretty much 3 thing to do every day 3 times a day and that's it. Didn't really pull me in and inspire me to the level i thought it would.Overall it was ok. (not good and not bad)
2,Not worth the price,I felt a little cheated when I bought this. It is more like a pamphlet than a book and wasn't that great of a read. I wouldn't recommend it.
1,"How to Get Ripped Off, in a supermarket pamphlet","This ""book"" is exactly like those old ones at the supermarket check out which were 39 cents! Not only is it only a few pages long, it is marked $3.00 on the back as suggested retail, yet Amazon charged me $5.00. It is a ridiculous waste of money. Call a friend who has it and they can read it over the phone in 3 minutes to you!"
1,Save the money,This book isn't worth the money. It's the same message you've heard over & over.You'll get more out of the Abraham & Hicks books. Also Shakti Gawain's Visualization book is better.
3,Cute & cheap,This is a cute idea to give to a Family Guy fan for a small gift/stocking stuffer. It's about as durable as a Nerf - don't let the dog see it!
5,The Family Guy Stewie football head,It's a foam rubber football that looks like the head of Stewie - it's perfect! It made a great gag gift for Christmas.
5,Stewie football head,My friend is a Stewie Griffin fan from Family Guy. I gave him this toy for Christmas and he really loves it. My friend is an adult but enjoys the Stewie merchandise.
2,Much Smaller Than I Thought,"I ordered this for my boyfriend just as a gag. We're both huge Family Guy fans so I thought it would be funny. I was dissapointed when I received it in the mail and saw just how small it was. Definitely not the size of your average football. I put it in his stocking this Christmas and got a little laugh out of him. Oh well, it's Stewie and none the less, it's cute."
5,PIECE OF ART,"THIS IS A PIECE OF ART. I am sure this will have a very good value in the future...ps. You cant play with this very hard, IT WILL break. Dont get it wet, it will be worse!I would recomend buying two: 1 for playing and the other to display somewhere without even taking the plastic off..."
4,Good Read,"While I always enjoy Michael Palmer's work, Sisterhood had it's slow moments where I seemed to ""plod"" along until something happened. However, those small breaks were worth hanging in there as Mr. Palmer came through with a surprise ending and a great wrap up of all the characters involved.I always recommend his writing and will continue to follow it as religiously as I have in the past.Always a great recommendation."
3,Disappointing,"I've now read all but one of Michael Palmers's books and this really wasn't that great. For some reason, maybe because the printing is large, the story seemed short.The book is based around a highly contriversial topic, euthanasia. Most of Palmer's books have been centered highly around hospitals and procedures. While this one had a doctor and nurse, it didn't seem like one of his typical books. The suspense just wasn't there. I've you've never read a Michael Palmer book, don't start with this one or you'll probably never read another again."
5,SISTERHOOD,Have read all of Michael Palmer's books and enjoyed every one of them. He is one of my favorite writers...
4,the Sister Hood,I've always enjoyed reading Michael Palmer and this was no exception to the rule. His medical thrillers never disappoint me.
4,Great Read,Michael Palmer creates books are a page turner. I will continue to read his books as long as he sticks to the formula he uses
4,Good first book,"Good book, perhaps too good. Not long ago an actual male nurse was arrested charged with his 'one man brotherhood', so to speak. After reading this book one wonders: did he act alone or were there more 'brothers' and/or 'sisters'. Was he inspired by this book?Perish the thought.Scary scenario if you are about to be hospitalized. Actually, only under certain circumstances very clearly explained in the book. I may have another serious surgery in 2013 but this is not going to discourage me from doing so..."
3,"Good, but had a sad death","I thought this book was good, overall. Had good suspense and interesting characters (Dr. David and his nurse lady-friend, Christine. But i think my favorite characters were David's friends, Eddie and his wife Teresa. I was really sorry that Eddie had to die in his attempts to help DAvid, in the end. I'm almost angry at the author for letting that happen to his character. I would completely understand if his wife TEresa never forgave David for her husband's death (even though it wasn't DAvid's fault). For me, that kind of ruined the 'happy' ending"
4,High Suspense,"A highly suspenseful thriller filled with tension. I found myself peeking ahead in the story, on occasion, to find out if the bad guys were actually stopped or the good guys made it through another crisis. The main characters were easy to identify with right from the start and the story moves along at a very fast pace. Hard to put down."
2,It could be more exciting...,"This book took me several months to finish reading it..why? Because I felt so bored half way through the book. Well, I finally forced myself to finish it...the thrills didn't kick in until the last couple of chapters.. His other books, Silent Treatment & Natural Causes, were much better."
2,"Because Palmer's Prose Is So Bland, The Story Suffers","This was underneath a good story, but Palmer's obvious and utterly mainstream style of description made me feel like I was reading the made-for-TV version of a formerly interesting novel. I definitely won't be reading anything else by him, I couldn't bear the boredom."
2,Not as clean as expected,"Purchased for use in home herbal mix as an alternative to purchasing pricier mixes. Not as clean as I expected -- found stems and other ""hard"" stuff. Lots of powder in the bottom of the container. Disappointed in the quality. Most of my money was apparently spent on packaging."
4,Good general introduction,"When I was much younger and first started reading the Horatio Hornblower books by C.S. Forester, I was blown away by the authenticity, yet puzzled by the jargon - what's a halliard, for example, or a topsail? What does it mean to shorten sail, and what is the lee side of a ship? This book would have helped immensely. It's not overly technical, nor does it swamp you with minutiae, but it gives you a good general overview of the British ships of the Napoleonic era, what the nautical terms are, what life was like on board and a couple of summaries of battles for good measure.This is an appetizer, but what an appetizer it is. If you're looking for more technical specs of ships of the line look elsewhere, but if you're a newbie to the entire historical nautical fiction scene, I can think of few better places to start."
1,illustrations are inferior,The illustrations in this illustrated book are without detail and almost useless. If you are using this book for reference purposes forget it. It looks like the author passed the origional images through an imaging software program to distort them enough not to have to pay royalities or something. I'm very disappointed.
5,to service my zero turn mower,"well built, the long flexible spout works perfect to get to far reaching service points on my mowing equipment. i am proud to have this added to my tool crib."
1,Bad product,"When I opened the package for the item, I could still feel grease on the container. I was thinking may be this item was returned by someone.I filled the container with oil and noticed immediately that the container was leaking oil. Now I have a messy clean-up to do on my stairs.Even if it does not leak, the product is still pretty low quality.Amazon should not sell a defective item which was returned."
4,"It's an oil can, it works, what else is there.",I bought this because my old oil can gave up the ghost. This one was priced right and works very well. All in all it's what I expected.
3,Plews oil can,"The oilcan looks good, BUT....when I ordered it it was advertised as MADE IN AMERICA, the tag on the oilcan itself said""made in china"" So I was a bit disappointed to say the least I don't shop or buy at "" Harbor Freight"" because all thier merchandise is made in china and is just crap....even thier grinding discs and cutoff wheels.I've learned that its much better to buy quality and only buy it once, than it is to buy crap 2 or 3 times....As I said above, the oil can looks good, so I will try it....If it doesn't perform or last like it should, I will add ""Plews"" to my listof crap made in China....Don't buy...."
3,Just ok,The first time I wore these boots I had a hard time putting it on because of the side zip mechanism. The side zip is a major part of the boot because you cannot wear or remove the boot without having to zip or unzip it. Other than that it fits perfectly and so far I think it is really slip resist? I hope the side zip mechanism will last for long and not be destroyed some time soon or else the boots will be useless!
1,Not worth your money,"A mediocre intro into such a fascinating subject. Instead of explaining concepts and helping develop abilities to solve problems, Griffiths plays silly algebra games throughout this text. Some truly elementary material he made rather complicated, explaining the obvious but omitting points crucial for understanding. With this book, forget about any intuitive knowledge of QM. If you like the monkey business of endless calculations, this one will not get you bored. But if you simply want to learn this fabulous branch of modern physics, consider N.Zettili, ""QM Principles and Applications"", which I guarantee you'll find invaluable. A little note for students to whom this reading is mandatory: Save your own nerves, and get the Solution Manual - will help you a lot on the exams."
2,Sent international edition instead of US edition pictured,The book was in good condition but was not the edition I expected to receive. I expected the US edition and instead got the international edition--not the same quality of binding or printing.
4,Very good,"I liked Griffith's Introduction to Quantum Mechanics a great deal. I liked his Electrodynamics book too. What I like most about Griffiths is that if something is important he will say so, if something is difficult he will say so, if something confounds everyone who sees it he will say so. Many other authors in physics pretend to be computers, and leave any intuition or feeling about the material they introduce entirely to the reader to learn for himself. We are not computers, we all understand things in very human ways, although I think the proud like to pretend everything is obvious to them and that personal comments such as Griffiths provides just insults their prodigous intelligence.The only problem I have with the book is that the shmucks didn't put a single answer in there. That's why I didn't give it 5 stars. How are you supposed to learn it if you don't know where you might have gone wrong in your answers?"
5,Well rounded,"The book is overall well rounded. The notation is clear and concise, making reading the textbook significantly easier. Also, the topics are well organized. The book is overall, self-contained. Seldom did I need to refer to other books to clarify a concept. You should work through the examples since that is how some topics are taught (i.e. Stark Effect, Slater determinants, and others). I highly recommend this book."
4,Better approach,Griffith takes a different approach to introducing QM by ignoring the historical development and stepping into the math right away. QM can be considered similar to taking a bunch of baby physicists and dumping them in the pool at the deep end.His text shares the same problems all QM textbooks have which is they expect only the smartest students to be able to come up with the math.Having taken nearly 2 years of QM I'd recommend helping students by thickening it up more along the lines of his E&M; text.What's really needed is a better version of Liboff who covers a lot of territory.
4,Great Introductory Text,I used this book as an undergraduate and I found it to be a great introduction to the field of quantum mechanics. I took the class as a chemist with a strong math but weak physics background and found it easy to read and understand. I agree that it is not for those looking for an in depth treatment of the subject however it is excellent for a first encounter with and introduction to quantum. In my graduate studies of physical chemistry I found myself constantly re-reading some of it's chapters to get the basics down before moving on to the more advanced treatments in other texts. My only problem was with the book itself as the binding wore out and now the spine is detached from the book so the pages are constantly threatening to fall out of the cover.
4,Good choice as a first step,"This is really a nice book to get a feeling about Quantum Mechanics. In just 450 pages, it covers most of the subject. Of course, with so few pages, you can't expect to see everything in depth.The biggest quality Griffiths has, both in Introduction to Quantum Mechanics and Introduction to Electrodynamics, is developing a kind of physical intuition about the subject. The biggest flaw is a lack of mathematical rigour. Conserning this book, for example, I missed an axiomatic structure-like treatment of the theory. I would really recommend Cohen's book to anyone who wish to learn more."
4,OK intro to QM,"This is a pretty decent introduction to QM. Not many prereqs are assumed which is good. Ch. 4 is organized a bit strangely (angular momentum is presented after the hydrogen atom). However, you will probably have to read a more advanced book to move on to QFT."
4,"Good Condition, Respected Author","I'm making this review short. Griffiths is a well rounded author on physics who also wrote my class textbook on electrodynamics. He's gives a more human feel to the text rather than making the subject seem more mechanical.The book is also came in good condition, and I've been using it well throughout the semester.-Nels"
5,Best Introductory Quantum Textbook,"All I have to say is that David J. Griffiths' Introduction to QM Textbook is by far the best one out there. Honestly, you have to read and compare it to other textbooks to really find out the scope of how great this is especially for an Introductory Quantum Mechanics. Highly Recommended!"
4,LOVE IT!!!!,"My kids really wanted this for Christmas and I couldn't find them in any stores. I had gotten them the Cube People last year and we have had such a hoot with them. The batteries are still working!!Went to Amazon, found these 2 at a reasonable price, had them wrapped and shipped at last minute and Voila! they were under tree on Christmas morning. Cool Gift for those Adults that have everything and fun for kids too."
4,Yum!,"I was pleased that each pocky stick was individually wrapped. The flavor was exactly what I expected. My only complaint was that all the pocky was broken in at least two places. But that could very easily be the box it shipped in, which looked beat up. I would order this again, just with better shipping."
3,Bang the chime slowly?,"This film is not for everyone. It moves slowly and has multiple settings and a fractured timeline that makes it not always clear the ""who, what, when and where"" of the scenes we are viewing. Part of the story concerns a sort of quest, and that is what watching this film may feel like. Yes, we do care about these characters and the situation they are in, but we may not understand them, and sitting through to the end may be our quest for that understanding. While the production values and acting are fine, the film is ultimately not well-enough crafted to clearly guide us to a successful result of our quest. (Then again, it might be worth a second look.)"
3,a toy that sheds!,"This dog was a shock. I took it out of the box and realized that it's about twice the size of our own actual ShihTzu dog. It's enormous! And the long hair on this creature is annoying. It sheds everywhere, and gets stuck to everything. I can not stand this toy, but my son who is 3, loves it. He named it, and likes to nap with it. I try to deter him from this because he wakes up with faux hair all over the bed and all over himself. I gave it three stars because he loves it. I would have given it one star if it were completely based on my feelings."
1,Not what it appears,This product is not worth ordering. It is almost twice the size of an actual Shih Tzu. It is hard and stiff and does not sit like the picture. It will shed and face is not as cute as picture. I ordered it for my brothers son after he visited and wanted to take my real dog home with him. I ended up sending this item back.
3,Bigger Than I Thought - Wiry Beast,"First off, this plush Shih Tzu is a lot bigger than I expected. I admittedly failed to read the part where it states: Measures 15.5"" x 12"" x 8"". My fault entirely, but just a heads up to everyone else.Secondly, the ""fur"" that is used is C-H-E-A-P! Not something I would expect from Melissa and Doug. The plush Shih Tzu they have pictured looks soft and cuddly. Mine has fur that is wiry and stands out in all directions. Poor thing looks terrified and in need of a good bath.Third, the two front arms have some sort of stiff armature within (maybe wire). Not so much a concern if the Shih Tzu is used for display or light play. But if your child (or whoever) typically wrestles with their stuffed animals, be sure that the wires don't begin to poke out.Overall, this item is okay. My son likes it. However, I have issues with the quality of its ""fur"" and wish the wire (?) in the arms weren't so close to the surface. (And that I had read how big it actually is.)"
1,Downright painful,"As they say in Yiddish: Oye Vey. This book is painful.I was so hopeful too: Great concept (romance in the 60+ crowd), interesting setting (NYC upper society). But the only thing that held it together was one cliche after another!I don't understand how this book got through the entire New York agent/publishing scene (not to mention, apparently, an extended network of family and friends who critiqued it for him) -- and the writer still couldn't come up with even one original analogy or description in the entire manuscript!Really. The writing is that bad. And that's not even mentioning the wooden characters, the stiff dialogue, the forced plotline. It was so bad, I left it on the plane when I landed!"
4,funny and poignant,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and found it funny and perceptive. The author (a first time author at 65, no less) drew characters with real personality, and I was touched by the depth of feeling that Dan, the protagonist, continued to feel for his late wife, as well as for the loss he felt when his only son announced his plans to marry out of the faith. Though a couple of the characters' voices were a bit unrealistic, it didn't detract from the enjoyment I had watching Dan figure out how to live out the last decades of his life, and which woman to choose as his companion. I would certainly read another book of his. -- Judy Gruen, author, ""The Women's Daily Irony Supplement,"" [...]"
2,If You Like This Kind of Thing...,"What a disappointment. The idea is good, the characters presentable, but the writing- I would say it's on a high school level but that would be insulting intelligent high schoolers. This said, if you want to read middle-aged chick lit that's told from the male's point of view, this one's for you."
3,beautiful BUT misleading,"I found these to be beautifully made, however I chose this slipper based mostly on the removable insert feature. A feature that is not factual. Happy for now... until it comes time for refreshing."
3,It's okay,I was so excited to see this with my niece who is reading the books. I read them as a child also. She received it for Christmas this year and we all watched it. I could barely keep my eyes from rolling. The acting was pretty bad. I also felt Mandie was too old. With all that I was still happy that they made a movie about Mandie. She is a wonderful character for little girls.
1,Buyer Beware: Don't Get Suckered by this Dead Fish,"Your usual standard industry shinola, puffy and pretty meaningless for everyone but the most devoted of McLachlones. It's a really lousy, really boring, really obvious attempt to prove there's one born every minute. Don't YOU get caught on the hook by this dead fish of a book!"
3,More like a tour book,"This book was more like a tour book than anything, which is not neccessarily bad. It kind of brough me back to all three liliths that i went to with it's color photos (lilith did not have a tour book). I found the biographies somewhat interesting, but it didn't really cross either line: it is not a tour book and it is not a book book, which was a little schizophrenic :( I wish that it was either one or the other. However, in it's entireity, it is a nice tribute to lilith and the women behind the tour and the women that influenced the tour"
2,It's Okay... If You Like This Sort of Thing,"I almost died when I saw this so-called writer's name on a story in a mag here about sex toys, gack! A somewhat misleading book pretending to be authorized (which is just an ignorant jab at a real writer's book, imnsho). Like, so what? I mean, Lilith is not all she's cracked out to be, if you know what I mean, like, she kills men and eats babies. Like, that's the point of this book. Oh, McLachlan's name is on the intro but i highly doubt she wrote it herself, judging by how she has so many problems making sense when she talks to the media, too. I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody but my worst enemy (and then, only if I'm really disparate)."
1,a pennie for your dots,"Though this book was in no way well-written, or enjoyable to read, I did gain one thing from this journey into mediocrity: a name for my new cat! ray+ellen=rayella! [see the November '96 issue of Chatelaine mag. for more on Sarah's *close* friend Buffy, she's been around since Sarah's high school days]. take this, love, take it down."
3,donated it to local humane society,the price and size were right to donate to humane society. My cats have refused to switch to purina or whiskas from Blue buffalo. I was seeking to reduce costs but just knew when I saw the big bag that there was no way my cats would eat it. I had thought it was fancy feast...white cat...gourmet...so when I realized its just a cheaper brand than even the purina ....well. As a donation though it helps Im sure.. The dogs will eat it if the cats wont..at my place the racoons get whatever the cats reject.
4,Very good primer for UD newbies,"This book is perfectly suited for those who want a very quick and clean introduction to Macromedia UltraDev. After I despaired over the awful tutorials by Macromedia (they made configuring the server connections a maddening ordeal of hit-and-miss), this was a welcome breath of fresh air. Everything was crystal clear, and setting up the server connections was a comparative breeze. The screenshots helped immensely in showing exactly what the user should be seeing after every step. I swept through half the book in about two hours, and I was able to execute every example without ever breaking open the enclosed CD. It is a tiny bit limited, because it's geared primarily toward the app's core features. But it really helped me hit the ground running with UD, and it's worth every penny."
2,"Lack of Depth, Lousy Look, Rushed to Market","This book is not worth the money. The layout is okay, but the book is in a dull blue color throughout, which personally is not attractive or easy to read. For the price they are asking, some color would be nice!An okay book for beginners, but I have read better."
5,Best Youth and Family Ministry Book,"This has got to be the BEST Youth and Family ministry book that I've ever read. It touches on EVERYTHING that the other books don't. There are way too many books that focus on just one age group or just the leaders and youth to make a point. This book speaks of how everybody is needed in faith formation and how those little things like simple smile, handshake, or hello can help a person ""come to faith.""The metaphor may seem cheesy at times, but it is very apt. While books like Doug Field's ""Purpose Driven Youth Ministry"" are good books, they don't touch on how everybody is involved in faith formation. They talk about programs and certain aspects of the ministry that still give congregations problems.While there's no ""one solution"" to ministry as it differs from place to place, FROGS WITHOUT LEGS certainly opens one's eyes - it's a great tool, and a great read for anybody interested in youth and family ministry. It brings lots of issues to light."
2,Nice looking but vinyl on inside,"Leather on the exterior is very nice looking, however the inward facing side is cheap vinyl and I expect it to begin cracking shortly."
2,Stiff,"I don't know that I've had a belt this stiff. I had to punch another hole in this and another belt I bought, perhaps I need to reduce my waist size for future pants, but I would have done better to have bought only one size over. I bought a 34"" and note that the internal most hole is at 34"". I know that makes sense but you might consider your size is a minimum size when you make your purchase.Update:The back of the belt is cracking around all the holes. Its really bad around the holes I use, but the belt still looks good from the front. Clearly cracking shouldn't happen so early."
2,Weird Look,"A very unnatural shine, which doesn't show in the illustration, caused me to return this belt. Construction quality looked good, but couldn't get past that plastic-y looking shine."
5,Very nice,I had bought the shoes before and was looking for the matching belt. was very happy to find the exact match.
2,SWAT SAUL,Amazon I'm blaming you guys for this one. The seller even though I may buy from them again did not give full discloser on this item.THEY ARE CHINESE KNOCK OFFS the velcrove and American flag are good but that is where it ends. The caps are not felt they are not canvas they are light cloth with single stitche (not straight). I would not be caught dead at the range with these on my head. I throw both of them back in the box and considered it a (you get what you pay for ) lesson the only redeeming value here was my sons found them and now play army with them so 2 stars.
3,SF Tactical Cap,"Average ball cap with velcro on front and back.Adjustable.WARNING: DOES NOT COME WITH FLAG AS ADVERTISED.beware: The Black cap shows dust/ dirt real easy, and you CAN get this cap cheaper (under $10) with free shipping that qualifies for super saver discount."
4,No Such Agency (NSA),"No Such Agency (NSA) great hat and it has this mystic to it. The flag really gets people asking questions. The only reason I gave it four stars is because the strap adjustment is back is made of plastic. Kind of like a camping backup the strap goes through a 2 segament piece and then curves around to back in and friction, weight and stress on it keeps it from slipping. This one tends to adjust it self after a bit."
3,Cheap Watch Band Used,The watch keeps good time but I am use to a decent watch band from Invicta. Thisband is more like TIN rather than stainless steel. I purchased it because it wasan ordinary looking watch for everyday. I normally purchase watches that areunusual. I guess I also purchased it because of how high the price of gold is andthis is plated over stainless with 23 KT gold.
2,Watch is not heavy enough. Cheap feel,"As a collector of Watches and the Invicta brand, this watch looks great. The Gold color is bright. Unfortunately, the watch feels cheap and lite.The INVICTA Pro Diver watches are incredible values for the money. And if you can find a Pro Diver Reserve brand then you will be extremely happy."
3,"Good, but not Second Sight.","Jonathan Aaron, Corridor (Wesleyan University Press, 1992)My first thought about Corridor, Jonathan Aaron's second book, was ""it's not as good as Second Sight (Jonathan Aaron's first book)."" I kept reading, and while it's still fine stuff, nothing ever convinced me to give up that first impression.Second Sight was a book that was full of good poems and great promise. Corridor is a book that is full of good poems, but the language here reflects an artist more set in his ways, for lack of a better way if putting it; there's less of the striking off into dangerous territory, less to make the reader work, less that will stop the reader and make him go back over the last few lines.Don't get me wrong, this is still good stuff. But if you can, go back a few years and pick up Aaron's first book, Second Sight, instead. Read this one afterwards. ***"
5,The Album's Great,"Besides her career was handed out to her and the fact that she's Jessica's sister, so it was very easy for her, every song in it is great. Obviously, she had the best people in Hollywood working with her and had most control of the album than other artists who are beginning their career. But at the end, who cares. The show was entertaining and the album is good to listen to."
5,*~* AsHlEe SiMpSoN aUtObIoGrApHy *~*,** This CD is absolutely amazing!!! It's my absolute favorite cd!! It's so down to earth and also inspirational and a great motivator! Ashlee expresses herself in almost each song and its perfect for anyone!! **
4,One gooooood autobiography!,"So what do u get when u mix the ""poppy"" gloss of Hilary Duff with the polished rock angst of Avril Lavigne's ""Under My Skin""? You get one stellar album and in this case, Ashlee Simpson's debut album, ""Autobiography."" From beginning to end Ashlee entertains us with her raspy voice throughout her extremely catchy songs. The title track is one of the catchiest and happens to be the theme song for Mtv's ""The Ashlee Simpson Show"". ""Shadow"" is an interesting tune about coping with being in the shadow of older sister Jessica. The two songs that will stay on repeat though are ""Love Me For Me"" which is pretty self explanatory and ""Surrender"" with an interesting arrangement of vocals and instruments. So if you are into good, pop rock, head bobbing music (good for car tunes) then get Ashlee Simpson's ""Autobiography"" now!!!"
1,THREE SIMPLE LETTERS WTF,"WHY WOULD ANYONE BUY THIS ALBUM! SHE CAN'T SING, HER SISTER CAN'T SING, AND NIETHER OF THEM HAVE ANY MUSICAL TALENT AT ALL. I WAS AHPPY WHEN SHE GOT CAUGHT ON SNL, BUT SHOCKED TO FIND THAT THE NATION OF TEENAGE GIRLS ARE SO BRAINWASHED THEY THINK SHES INNOCENT. AND IF I HEAR ONE MORE SONG FROM HER WHINING ABOUT HER SISTER GETTING ATTENTION I WILL BURN EVERY ALBUM OF HERS I CAN FIND. IN CONCLUSION I WILL NEVER GIVE THIS GIRL CREDIT, AND I WILL CONTINUE TO SRGUE WITH THOSE SPOILED TEENAGE GIRLS WHO LOVE WHOEVER IS ON THE COVER OF SOME DUMB MAGAZINE."
2,Over-hyped,"This is ludicrous how so many reviewers are giving this album 5 stars. This spoiled bit*ch can't sign and is simply riding the coattails of her older and much more vocally talented sister Jessica Simpson. I've listened to this album and in addition to watching this show since I am a music talent scout for Sony and am appalled by the fact that my company tried to sign her. I've worked with Jessica and the talent differences are obvious. I give this album 2 stars due to the fact that Pieces of Me is a decently good song by the message she was getting across and not music talent and vocals. Please do not purchase but I encourage you to listen to a portion of ""Pieces of Me"" through this same exact web page. Try it out but I am almost positive you won't like it.Thanks"
1,this is pop/rock? nah just trash,I heard la la for the first and asked myself IS SHE SERIOUS? she sounds like a whiny pussycat getting a body piercing or something. That sounds sad I know but so is the fact ashlee is doing music.
5,Ashlee Simpson's Autobiography is Awsome!,"Hey Everyone, My names Kristina and i'm an Ashlee Simpson insider! I'm here to tell you all that ashlee's new album Autobiography is Great! Her music is very fun and upbeat!! So all of you who havn't got out to but it yet, go get it today!! Also, Visit www.Ashleesimpsonmusic.com for more fun stuff with Ashlee!! Thanks Guys! <3 Kristina"
4,HATERS!,"You all need to open your mind more...music is a expression of ones feelings and dreams, it is not always ment to be perfect and in key. She is a talent just not a sunny perfect preppy like her sister. All familys have a darker side .....and she is it. And me being dark myself find it refresing to know others can express. May all your minds open wide enough for your ego's!"
2,...,"i'm not actually under 13... my computer is just screwd up... heres the review:when i first saw the ashlee simpson show, i didn't really know what to think. although some of the songs featured on it were catchy, nothing really stood out to me. my friend owns this album so i listened to it at her house, and i liked some of the songs, but at the same time, ashlee seems kind of manufactured to me. i mean during the course of the show you see her change... i can't really explain but if you've seen it before, you would know. i mean ever since avril lavigne, every female artist that has been coming out goes after that look, that genre. it's all starting to seem the same to me... the only person i really can give credit to is avril, since she started it all.i don't hate ashlee simpson's music or anything, as i said before some of her songs did appeal to me, but unfortunately, she doesn't."
3,** Better Than Her No Talent Sister **,"This CD is not half bad! I was taken completely by surprise. I expected a bunch of a-typical, silly pop which is pretty much all there is right now ... but this isn't it. There are some really interesting, catchy tunes on this disc ... and Ashlee has a gruff, earthy voice that can make the windows shake! Nice!Why everybody pays attention to Jessica (other than her blonde hair) I don't know. Ashlee is so much more talented song and voice wise than Jessica is. This CD is pretty good. Enjoy."
4,"AUTOBIOGRAPHY, ASHLEE SIMPSON","I really liked this C.D. Personally I think it is important to keep your audience interested and she definitely does. I like the fact that she was daring enough to take a risk by doing a type of music that is a mixture of different genres, and it obviously did not hurt her at all, meaning her sales are through the roof. She is the big talk of the music industry, and I think she'll stay that way for a while."
4,This CD is good,"It's so annoying how people are criticizing Ashlee for her SNL messup while people like Britney Spears and Hialry Duff and half of the music industry lip synchs like there is no tomorrow. She a had a freakin voice problem and still gave her best . If an artist gets sick and can't perform a certain show and they lip synch...I aprreciate that they even showed up. Ashlee doesn't have the best voice but she sounds a hell lot better then Britney spears who Hardly ever sings live and when she does sing live it sounds like she's trying to poop!! The CD is fun, pop/rock and not bad at all! don't listen to the haters....all the songs are different and mostly all written by Ashlee.."
4,Great Album,"Ashlee's music is very unique. It has a punk flavor too it as well as a little bit of pop music. She has definitely succeeded in developing her own personality because her music is nothing like her sister's, Jessica. Ashlee is just as talented as Jessica though, and her album reflects this. The lyrics to her music are easy to relate to and overall this album is awesome."
1,Booooooo,"There is a reason that you were booed at the Orange Bowl. It is because your music is a joke. You are not a performer. You suck. I hate your show. Can't we go one show without you talking about ""how cool your fan's are"", or ""my fans love my music"". It is not YOUR music, it is your PRODUCED IN A STUDIO VOICE! You can't make music. For anyone who thinks she rocks - she did six costume changes at her concert in Chicago. Ashlee - you big nosed, dyed hair, average looking girl - there are no ""costume"" changes in rock music.Loser"
1,I Don't Get It,The lack of talent is unbelievable on this album. Poor vocal skill over engineered to hide the fact there is no quality. Writing equal only to poor high school yearbook poetry without the depth. Save your money don't go to the concerts and like all bad dreams she to shall pass
1,Who listens to this?,"Jessica Simpson does not deserve to be famous. She was able to show enough skin to sell her sub-par pop music to a few million people and pave her way to her own reality tv show. What else was she able to do? Make her family name famous enough to give her younger sister a record contract and tv show of her own. I won't even go into the lipsynching thing, but do yourself a favor and save yourself the embarssment of your children going through the basement one day, finding this cd, and losing all respect for you."
5,Great CD,"I really enjoyed this CD throughly! I though that the CD had a little something for each of my moods, so it was like if I feel bad one day or good then there is a song for it! I am very glad that Ashlee has found her own style of music rather than following Jessica Simpson's style, considering I am not a fan of Jessica's but a big fan of Ashlee's! This is a CD worth every penny! Especially, if you love music and are a Ashlee Simpson fan!!"
5,The Best Freakin Album!!!,"OMG!!! I Love Ashlee Simpson and this is a must have!!! Now when I first heard Ashlee's ""Pieces Of Me"" I thought Oh her album is goign to be just like Hilary Duff's ""Metamorphosis"" (which is a great album by the way) but it wasn't it has much more edge to it than Hilary's and I could tell this when I heard the song ""LA LA"" and ""Love Me 4 Me"" their great songs trust me buy this CD it's worth every cent!!!"
1,WOW!!!!! What an AWESOME Frisbee!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Yes. The best Frisbee in America.I needed a Frisbee the other day when I was at a family reunion at my uncle's house last Sunday. There were a bunch of kids so we needed some entertaining. After laughing with a video of Simpson's monkey dance that we downloaded, we wondered if we could get a frisbee. I didn't know any store in which I could get one so my father told me ""Hey, you should go and buy the CD of that girl that was dancing like a monkey""Awesome idea. 30 minutes I was back at home. I took out the frisbee and began throwing. The kids and the dogs had a hell of a time catching it.Pure entertainment people. The Greatest frisbee in America!!!!"
1,She makes her sister look talented - 0 stars,"Just when you thought music could sink no lower than Jessica Simpson, her little sister comes along with her whole ""punk"" music and image.""I sing punk music actually. I love to run around and scream and rock out and play guitar."" - Ashlee Simpson"
1,Who is still buying this crap?,"Pieces Of Me is one of the worst songs on the radio right now. It's awful!! Little Ashlee has no discernible talent whatsoever and her show was just a marketing ploy to get naive MTV viewers to go out and waste their money on this CD. The whole stereotype about music producers creating these puppets is, sadly, all but true. Ashlee can't sing, play an instrument, or write music. But yet, because her sister is famous, MTV was able to saddle Ashlee with some generic songs, and a grating TV show, and voila!! A star is born. It's so sad.And all I hear is how Ashlee is ""so punk!!"" Yeah, I'm sure that The Ramones, The Clash, and The Sex Pistols are shaking in their boots.Save your money."
1,Where is the talent?,"SNL screw up (and complete lack of professionalism)notwithstanding, this girl's voice is like nails on a chalkboard. Just like Brittney Spears and all the other bubblegum trash that's so prevelant these days, she's trying to substitute style for substance but she's not pulling it off well at all. How nice it is that our society accepts an image now in lieu of actual talent. I'm tired of hearing all these kids who are 5 to 10 years younger than me whining about how horrible their life is when they're making hundreds of thousands of dollars to push their less than mediocre skills. These are the kind of problems you WANT to have. I'll pass on the angst and pick up a CD with real music, thanks."
4,Old people back off,I thought this album was more for the younger generation pop rock listeners so old people shouldnt waste their time listening to Autobiography if they are just gonna diss it and pay it out. I really like the song La La but pieces of me got real old real fast.
1,"ummm sorry girl, but your first album sucks :(","Sorry girl, i was hoping this would be alot better because your show rocks. but your first album kinda sucks. I think maybe after you get some more practice with your voice maybe your next release will be better. SORRY :(- Jessie"
1,LET'S DO THE ASHLEE SIMPSON DANCE!!!,"Someone tell Mr. Simpson to stop pimping his daughters please.I hope no one believed that ""acid reflux"" crap. First they said the vocals weren't supposed to be playing, then they say she needed them because of her acid reflux. To the whole ugly Simpson family- go get real jobs!!By the way, Jessica looks like an alien."
1,What the hell is wrong with you people?,"how the hell could this album have an average of 4 1/2 stars!!? you know what this means, right? people are gonna come on this site looking for good music and see oh ashlee simpsons album got that many stars it cant be bad. well it is bad, very bad, in fact ive contracted a uncureable STD just from watching a music video of hers. if i had the power i wouldnt give her a star i give her a plastic bad to choke herself with. she is awful untalented musician who is riding in on the same horse as her big breasted older sister. neither of you have talent so just please for the sake of the children - GIVE IT UP."
1,I really don't like her music,"As a person she's not much of a brain, but she is entertaining, kind of like the car wreck you can't help but be drawn to, as shown on her reality show. Sure she has the looks and the clothing styles down, but she is not cut to do music at all and she may have been pressured by yes men around her to do this and was told she could sing just so they can capitalize on the simpsons mania we see all over television. I hate to say it but ashlee is the worst singer I have heard in my 22 years of life, and it's not because of the music she does, it's the vocal skills she is lacking in completely, it sounds like a wreck and she's in it for the money, no doubt. True she had it coming with the orange bowl incident but maybe it's a sign that she is not fit to be a musician at all and should consider going to college or designing clothes or something like that. That's my review, the best I could do by seperating the music and the person."
1,Autobiography....Zero Stars,"Why do famous people have the tendency to be so gullible when it comes to a career move.Music talent doesn't always run in the family.Jessica Simpson is a great singer,despite her lousy songs.She has control over her voice and i love it.However,Ashlee Simpson's voice is beyond ATROCIOUS.This is the worst thing i have ever heard,William Hung sings more convincingly than her,this is horrible.Way before the SNL incident i thought that she was a terrible singer.Now has for the title of this album was a complete mistake.She poses has a song writer.Sending your half done poetry to some one who converts them into song lyrics is not an autobiography.This is what i call a joke singer and there are many of them out there.The whole point is that Ashlee needs to try other career options before she makes another complete fool out of herself."
1,where is she?,"She was famous for 3 months in 2004 for her 1 hit ""Pieces Of Me"" Her songwriting is good...but she is talentless everywhere else. her follow up singles all flopped! her show did too and her and her sister jessica who is also a 1-hit-wonder flopping everywhere is over...so both DIE!!"
1,I didnt like it Sorry :(,"Got it yesterday and after a whole of listening to it, Sorry Ashlee but i didnt like it. Some of the songs were ok but even the good ones were pretty bad. I hope your next album is much better. 1/5 stars"
1,you know what,I wouldent have made a 1 star review of this album but i am angry tired and had a bad day today so im giving it one star becuz its awful and shes stupid and i hate her.
1,garbage....and now everyone knows...thanks halftime,"its hard to put into words what i need to say. i am a musician. i am in a band and we work hard writing our OWN music and playing out and doign al that other stuff bands should do. TO SEE A NOBODY FAKE TALENLESS LOSER LIEK ASHLEE SIGING ON STAGE AND HAVING A RECORD DEAL MAKES ME WONDER WHAT MUSIC IS COMING TO NOW N' DAYS. i meen we all know ashlee will have gone the way of the dodo in 2 years, but the fact that she can even have that 15 minutes of fame just becuase of jessica is just sickening. hey Ashlee..your a disgrace to music and im sooooo very glad you got booed at the performance. i hope you now relize that people will not be fooled. we all know you suck ..please ..leave the performing up to the musicians who write their OWN music and put the time and effort into it. your a disgrace...but dont worry your not the only one...people you want some real music ...nonpoint, breaking benjamin, incubus, sentenced, disturbed, boysetsfire..."
1,1 and 1/2 stars because some of the songs are tolerable,"""We have to make sure you're the opposite of your sister,"" Ashlee's manager father told his latest starlet (Entertainment Weekly, 8/23/04).This statment spells out one thing. P-o-s-e-r. I really think the only reason they made this cd is because of image. The lyrics are bad as well as the singing. She's trying to be what she is not. I don't know what she is, but I know one thing: she isn't talented."
1,she's a phony,frist of all she's not worth ur money. she lip-synch's. second of all she can't sing unlke jessica. iam so tired of people thinking they can just make a record just because thier sister or brother already is famous the only people who buy her music is little 10 year olds and that cause they don't know what real music is. also i just wanted to point out thatashley can't sing or act
2,Poor uneducated Ashlee,"I am disgusted with Ashlee. She tries to pass this CD off as her original work. She ""sang"" on it but had almost 0 effort of her own in it. She lets the records company control her. The CD itself is not that bad. I do not like Ashlee's way of music or her opinons. She lied to millions of people, and then got her stories mixed up. However I still like Pieces of Me. Maybe if she tried on this CD instead of letting everyone else do it for her people would like it better. Look at Avril Lavigne. Her first CD was panned to no end, but ""Under My Skin"" still gets respect because she wasn't just handed the music.Recommendation (alternative to Ashlee): Bjork, Tori Amos, Utada Hikaru"
1,"Discusting, Scratchy-Voiced Old Drone... Eeeeeeeeeeeww!","How discusting!!! I must say, that the contents of this album are absolutely pitiful with Miss Simpson's scratchy little voice totally struggling to reach notes that are NOT high. Please, DO NOT waste your money on this horribhle attempt at pop music. Just like her sister, the Dronesons continue to fill our world with horrible, ""I am sooooo cute and rich"" merchandise. Not to mention, Ashley Simpson LIP-SYNCS!!!!! She's just as worse as fake prats Wannabe-Princess Hilary and Ms. Lohans."
1,we are 3 million fools who bought this album - terrible!!,"Its not her fault either - Its a shame how the music industry has been putting out such of the same trash over the last 8-12 years and we are so used to it that we dont know whats good anymore.Ashlee is like any other girl, rock n roll, wanna be at any local bar/music joint in any city......sorry hun."
3,She has a better voice than Jessica!!!,"Granted her lyrics do appeal to the teen sect, but I think she has a MUCH BETTER VOICE than her sister Jessica. All the hype over Jessica is about her looks and her DD's. Dont' get me wrong I like Jessica too but Ashlee is not ugly and as far as singing capabilities Ashlee has my vote, hands down."
1,Let me order the crap special with a side order of sh*t.....,"Do I even need to go into explanation on why this CD is so horrible? Of course I do! Otherwise it is just a little rude, don't you think? I have three good reasons why you shouldn't get this CD:1] How can you tell if that's even her singing? Didn't anyone see Saturday Night Live?2] She's just angry that her sister is far more popular and pretty and is married, blah, blah, blah......3] Do you really want your friends to see you with an Ashlee Simpson CD? Come on, not even you guys are that stupid, except you......There you go, three perfectly good reasons why you shouldn't get this CD. She's not even that good at singing,Wait a minute, thats another reason!............."
1,this is horrible,And no I don't own the album i'm a 19 year old guy. but i came here to laugh at the samples (after seeing her at the orange bowl) and she's the least talented person in all of popular music. the people who likes her are 14 and below.(and that's...ok) if you are older than 14 and you like her.. i'm SO sorry you need to grow up and listen to real music
1,don't waste your money,"this is not good music, in fact it shouldn't even be called music. but it's fun to lip synch to because it won't matter if you mess up!"
3,Ashlee's been outed,"So ashlee was just caught lip synching on saturday night live. This doesn't really affect the quality of her songs because I'm sure they're fine. But what it does prove is that Ashlee's fame is only due to Jessica's success, not her own talents. Her voice has been touched up by machinery and played over and over when she performs. You can't hear her breathing when she's singing! it's ridiculous! So Kudos to whoever wrote the songs for autobiography, but for all the real talent that's trying to be discovered in this world, Ashlee's jus tusing up the resources."
1,UMMM WISH I DIDNT BUY THIS NOW,"THE PACKAGING IS NICE, ASHLEE IS VERY PRETTY BUT THE MUSIC IS HORRIBLE. EVERY SINGLE TRACK ON THIS CD SOUNDS LIKE IT WAS COPIED FROM SOME OTHER ARTIST, ONLY IN REALLY BAD AND CHEAP WAY.SHE OBVIOUSLY GREW UP LISTENING TO GARBAGE AND HOLE BUT ATLEAST THEY HAD A BIT OF TALENT. THIS ALBUM PRETTY MUCH EATS IT. NOT RECOMMENDED. 1/5 STARS"
1,ARRGGGGG i thought this was gonna be good!,"Bought this cd because youre soo cute, but sorry to say it sucks rotten eggs! Your voice could be better, your lyrics could be alot better and the music sounds like music they should be playing at target while you shop! your cd gets 1 out of 5 stars!"
5,Not Like Sister....AND Thats Great,Unlike her sister Ashlee Simpson is more punk than pop and that is great!Her album is Fantastic and i urge you to pick it up if you also like music like Avril Gwen Hillary Duff and Lindsay Lohan. It has original music written by her which you dont see much anymore. The vocals are very good too.
1,Fake Reviews,Ashlee Simpson sucks. And all of these so-called positive reviews are fake. Look at them. They've never reviewed anything else and they all appear in clumps...This should be illegal.
1,Horrible,"My sister got this CD and I listened to it. Its horrible. She obviously has no talent... And everyone saw her for the fake she was when she was on SNL.Do NOT buy this CD. If you did, take it back and demand your money back.Acts like Ashlee Simpson are ruining music."
1,Omigawd!,"Liek Omigawd!!11!!! WuN TiEm I WuZ LiEk @ A FrenZ HouZ n She LieK PlaYd DeZ AlbUm n LieK OMEHGAWD AsHleE HaZ sO MuCh TaLeNt Y'aLL!!!! DEWD, SHE'S LIEK A FREGN JEANIZ!!111!

Ashlee is fake."
4,Ashlee rocks! (I hate Jessica!),"Ashlee Simpson is the best! She has a clear, great voice and she's not afraid to be herself..[...] Ashlee rox and she should be crown'd queen of music for her lovely voice!!!"
3,Ok,"I'm not a big fan of Ashlee Simpson herself, but her music is pretty good. I don't really like her voice either, its like she tries too hard to make herself sound raspy/rockish. Some of the lyrics were pretty stupid too, like they were just trying to make it rhyme. Overall, the CD is alright and pretty fun to sing along to."
3,"Gimme A Break, People","I am by no means some huge Ashlee Simpson fan. In fact, I was quite kind of put off by the way she gained her success through MTV. But people have been seriously ragging on her since her SNL incident and in all honesty, it's not all that fair. Most top 40 artists use backing tapes. They just don't always get exposed for it. Britney Spears basically completelly relies on hers as did people like Madonna, Janet Jackson, and Paula Abdul in the 1980's and early 1990's. Ashlee just got exposed of it on live TV which stinks for her becuase it may have damaged her career significantly. It was obvious that she was not a live singer. Her croaking out her songs on her MTV show was painfully obvious of that....the girl is NOT much of a singer.People are horrible for building celebrities up then bitterly knocking them down when they make a mistake. It's barbaric and disgusting how people jump on here and give her CD one star reviews and name call."
1,......embarassing,"how can u even mutter the words ""rock out"".....ashlee simpson....u really are an embarasment to rock and roll....after snl and orange bowl.... i think peopel are now catching on...."" hey, she sucks, lets buy something good""....hey people go but a real cd....i would suggest disturbeds new one"
3,Shes not that good of a singer,"I do like some of the songs on the cd, but she is not really that good. I know alot of singers that can sing so much better than her. I bought the cd because my friend told me about it. The only songs I like are Autobiography, pieces of me, and shadow. This cd is not AMAZING. his is nowhere the best cd I own. I recommend people like: Christina Aguilera, and Kelly Clarkson."
1,(...),(...)Sorry about that but about nothing sounds worse than her voice.And you know you people are right i read a review where someone said they mixed her songs...well they were right they would have to or no one would buy this trash.I got this for christmas and i lisnened to it all the way through its no good.The only good thing about this cd is you can sell it on ebay.And i really feel sorry for anyone who buys this and wastes time they can not get back..do me a favor do not buy this cd.....Thanks
2,Michelle Branch? oh its Ashlee,"Now don't get me wrong i love pop music. But this album sounds like songs that teen singers like Michelle Branch and Hilary Duff passed on. I didnt read the liner notes so i dont know if Ashlee writes all of her own material. If she does then she needs to hire a songwriter and if she doesnt, fire them get some new ones. Her voice sounds like an angry version of Jessica on crack. I state again that i love pop music but i was really not feeling this at all. NEXT...."
3,I love her,"I love her, i hate ryan cabera, yeah and that chick that said she can sing better.....i doubt it, your stupid.....WTF! is wrong with you? she's not ugly."
2,Whoa.,"How can anyone... ANYONE like this artist? Its sad that she can make so much money for being a ""dark"" version of her sister. Shes not rock... or punk... or any of that, the same way that Avril is not punk.. or hard rock. shes pop light rock. not talented. Music nowadays is just falling behind. lets get a artist who writes their own music and has to actually work for his/her spot at the top of the charts! and even though i dont like her sisters work, i can at least give her credit for making herself through hard work.I give this album 2 stars just because its better than lysdey lohan. *shudder*. also because i think some young kids would like it... but for the real rock fan this is a definite no. (not that a definite rock fan didnt know that already)"
1,She Will Never Be Her Sister...,"Who the hell is this girl. She has to stop moaning and bi*ching about her childhood was horrible and she was the left out one between the two sisters. NO SH*T!!! You will NEVER be your sister. Your sister is 100 times hotter then you are. The kid who said ""are those teeny bopper girls who have there mommy and daddy buy there entire wardrobe from Hollister and have never even heard of..."" is right. Anybody who likes this girl should go follow her.Talentless. Her songs say she was left out. You have all the money you ever wanted. You have no life except lip-syncing on SNL and blaming it on everyone else. Her band is probably those reject kids who shoot themselves because they had no friends in high school. These losers coming out like Avril Lavigne and G@y Charlotte are killing music. ANd whoever said classic rock sucks should be hanged. I don't have this CD and I never will. I just heard all of those meaningless songs on the radio!"
2,just stick to writing songs,"Ashlee's song ""Pieces of Me"" is a pretty good song. Her voice is pretty bad though. I have watched a few of her shows on MTV and everyone seems to be frustrated with her when she is trying to record. She can never get her voice to do right. They had to really help her voice out in the studio for her album. She is not a singer at all. But there are many out there who can't sing and they make it big. It is like they pulled her off the streets and asked ""hey would you like to be a star?"" ""It doesn't matter if you have talent or not."" Jessica can sing a little better but she yells and strains too much. Jessica definately has the looks in the family and apparently the voice. That is if you compare."
1,MUNDANE MUNDANE should be the name!,"""How do you know everything I'm about to say?"" asks the brunet member of TV's other cartoon family named Simpson, seemingly oblivious to her debut album's predictable script. ""La La"" casts Jessica's younger sister Ashlee as a barely legal temptress wanting to ""Make la la in the kitchen on the floor/I'll be a French maid when I meet you at the door."" Ironic or not, it's creepy. The music's mundane melange of Avril-ish brat pop and Sheryl Crow cod rock reaches its nadir on ""Love Me for Me,"" an anemic rip of AC/DC's ""Back in Black,"" wherein Ashlee does Courtney Love, wailing in lieu of hitting notes. ""Nobody's really seen my million subtleties,"" she says on the title track. This album doesn't change that."
1,More bubblegum trash,"After having endured the spectacle of Ashlee ""performing"" at the Orange Bowl (and receiving a thunderous barrage of well deserved boo's) it easy to see what Ashlee is - a packaged bubble gum queen with no musical talent whatsoever who was awarded a recording contract because of her name and her looks.There is nothing defensible in these songs, they are pure trash.This is just another example of Recording Company exec's hoping to score an easy buck on the backs of yet another teenage bimbo who can't sing, can't dance and can't write any remotely interesting songs.Its too bad young kids are spending their money on this junk.Hopefully Ashlee's 15 minutes are up."
2,ashlee simpson CD,"The cd was all right to girley, I basically only liked track #4 LaLa. Thats it. But if you like girley pop rock then you will like this CD.Brandon"
3,Ashlee Simpson No Longer Her Sister's Shadow,"Finally had a chance to get her album (I know a late buyer, lol) and I have so much to say about it. She is not the best singer in the world but neither was Courtney Love, but one thing they both have similar is they have great lyrics behind the good music. Nonetheless her freshman album is a perfect introduction to a 19-20 year old Ashlee who has dealt with heartbreak with her boytoy ""Unreachable"" to living in Jessica's limelight as her ""Shadow"" but being free, to finding a new love with ""Pieces Of Me"" to basically having a boy make her want to ""LaLa"", lol. Overall it is worth a listen and definetely worth getting to know Miss Simpson's ""Autobioghraphy"""
1,"Could Modern Music Get Worse? Yes, with Ashlee Simpson","I don't think I should waste my time analyzing why this album sucks. For reasons already explained by previous reviewers, the album is horribe and rides on the coat tails of ""Pieces of Me"" which isn't even a great song, even for bubblegum pop standards."
1,She's serious?,"When I 1st heard ""Pieces Of Me"", I quickly became addicted that I want to grab the whole album. When I got a copy, I was so disappointed! Only 2 or 3 songs there are considered good. I could conclude that she rushed her music career without much thought. Ashlee, if you are reading this, take time to do something and make sure everything goes great. If you guys don't know what I mean, watch the Ashlee Simpson show."
3,"A solid album, some great songs too....","Alright...so if you look at my other reviews...most of them are of the dark genre....but I broke down and got this album.I don't regret it....the songs are good...and she's kinda naughty too. I mean, how can you not love a french maid waiting for you at your door, like she sings in ""La La""? I think that is quite nice.Otherwise, the songs are kind of generic, but they aren't BAD. They are awesome songs, well written and her voice is great! Everyone needs some help starting out, and I'm sure once she starts (if she starts) writing her own music, it will be some good stuff.If you haven't already bought the album, I'd buy it, just so that you have something to go on, and wait for something new to come, which I hope it does."
1,Garbage CD! BOO!,Wow what concept why not ride on my sister Jessicas coat tails because I am a talentless oaf. If you actually happen to like this CD then you must be one of those mindless drowns that are hypnotized by MTV. Ashlee go back to being Jessicas sister and stop tring to become famous through your sister who does have alot talent. Better yet just go back to acting where you just might make it as a hack.
1,this album sucks.,I'm sorry to say that ashlee simpson is very dissapointing to become a singer. I saw here live at the MTV VMA's and she sucked singing live. Ashlee keep to your acting even though u suck at that as well. Jessica's cd is awesome. Ashlee I hop u do not come out with another album. P.S. Your voice is very aggravating.
5,Great New Sound,Ashlee Sipmson has a sound that's all her own. She doesn't have to live in her sister's shadow anymore because she's come out like a roaring lion. Ashlee's grabbed Pop music by the reigns and she's never letting go. This is the jolt in the arm that the music industry needed. She captures fun and the CD unleashes pulse-pounding music that you can't get out of your head.Great Pop/Rock music should accomplish a few things:1. Good Lyrics2. A Fresh Perspective3. Enjoyable from start to finish4. It should be Memorable5. An energy that's contagiousAshlee's CD is all of those. No other artist this year has put out a CD that's more worthy of being called great Pop Music than Ashlee Simpson.
5,best cd ever,"ashlee simspon is the best she totally rocks you'll love her songs once you hear it. She is better than her sister you'll love her lala,autobiography,pieces of me songs there all great songs."
5,Great Debut!,Ashlee's debut album definitely sets her apart from her sister. Ash shares her voice and thoughts with the world. I can't get enough of this CD and would recommend it highly!
5,"Ashlee Simpson's ""Autobiography"" kicks ass!","ever since i heard her first single ""pieces of me"" and watched her show on MTV i wanted her CD...and i got it Thursday, the 22nd ....and ever since then its been the only thing being played in my CD player...her lyrics are amazing and its cool that shes the one who wrote them...i also liked her vocals....her raspy voice is much different than her sisters and i like it."
2,Come On...Are You Serious?,"How can people give this record 5 stars when there are so many other rich and creative artist out there not even being played on the radio. They are the ones who should have #1 albums and singles. First off, Ashlee ""can"" sing, but her vocals are very limited. Especially when compared against her 8 octave voiced sister. But to her credit, there are some catchy tunes. ""Pieces Of Me"" is almost irresistable, and ""Shadow"" shows us how Ashlee delt with being the overshadowed by her very famous sibling, but most of the lyrics are so bad and the rest of the album lacks creativity and falls into practically the same formula track after track. And Ashlee's attemp to be so-called ""punk rock"" seems more forced than natural. Maybe with some growth and new experiences, Ashlee can find a nitch of her own instead of mimicing what she thinks is supposed to be cool music."
1,the day that mtv made it's biggest mistake,"what kind of world do we live in where a no talent clown can hop on her talentless sisters coat tails and ride them to the most publicized album in the history of music television. i swear if at the end of another mtv show i have to listen this fake, overpruduced and over-populized garbage i'm gonna hurl. the only good she brings to society is that she raises the price of clothes for people who think they can buy punk at Von Dutch. how does a no hit wonder get 15 hours of fame?oh and yea, i do know you better that you know yourself."
1,Same As JoJo: Untalented 1-hit-wonders that (...),"Same as Jojo she (...), September 5, 2004Ashlee Simpson is same as Jojo a Britney wannabe,they both haveanoying voices only ashlee's is so much worse.It sounds likeshe swallowed a tractor still turned on,been smoking for ever,and she is snorng.She is ugly ,and needed a stupid show to turnfamous.And again the only people who said that she was goodwas 10-15 year olds.(Ashlee go back to your sister's shadow you belong theretake this advise honey...just get it your an untalented kiddie star 1-hit-wonder just like (...)."
1,NOT ANOTHER AVRIL,"THIS WORLD DOES NOT NEED TO POSER BANDS AT ONCE, AVRIL IS ENOUGH... AT LEAST AVRIL HAS AN OK VOICE ASHLEE SOUNDS LIKE SHE IS DYING DURING THE WHOLE THING (I WISH) IN OTHER WORDS DO NOT BUY OR LISTEN TO THIS C.D. OR IT WILL SHOW HOW PATHETIC MUSIC HAS BECOME. ALL SHE SINGS ABOUT IS PAIN AND MISERY (SHADOW, PICES OF ME, ETC.) WHAT DOES SHE KNOW ABOUT PAIN NOTHING SHES RICH, FAMOUS, GOOD LOOKING, AND HAS SUPPORTIVE PARENTS SO SHE NEEDS TO SHUT UP"
1,"Terrible, thats it.","This ""person"" is just terrible. Nothing more, nothing less (well, maybe less) and I'm very happy to announce that she is long gone, and so is her co-hort in terrible singing Lindsay Lohan. But at least Lohan's hot, Ashley Simpson is one of the ugliest things I've ever seen, especially with her gay black hair. Her sisters hot, and basically every pop diva is hot, but Ashlee here has nothing, not even sex appeal. This is why she is forgotten completely, because nobody wants to here some ugly person TRY to sing, it just isn't worth anything. Even her posters should be burned!'Nuff said!"
2,Ahh-Who Cares,"I bought this album thinking that it would be as good as Jessica(big sis's) album In This Skin. IT WASNT!!!!! It was lame and annoying. Some songs were really bad some were irritating the two that i can think of that are good are ""Pieces Of Me"" and ""Love Me For Me"" but other than that its not a very good album. Dont waste your money on this buy Jojo's Cd or something but not this!"
1,this hurts music,"you're money going to this cd is hurting the music industry. while you could have spent you're $15 on a band that had fought it way to a record deal on skill, vision, and most of all hard work, you're money will go to a millionaire who has no reason to be on an cd she does not need nor deserve you're money. i do not need to list the ways you will be disapointed if you were to buy this album ( my sister purhcased it, and i am forced to stuff through this waste of vaulable resources whenever she decides to put it on) go and spend you're money on a band that had to work for what they have, and used the only thing they had, talent."
5,AWESOME,"I really like this album. I think it is so different from Jessica's and really has a lot of meaningful lyrics that really express Ashlee. A lot of artists say that they write music that expresses themselves. Ashlee's really does. It's so personal, but so cool. I just like to rock out to the songs. It's an album that both guys and girls can relate to and enjoy. It is different from the definition of Pop. She is no Britney, no Christina, not even Avril. She is something completely different and is really, really exceptional."
1,IS THIS ALBUM A JOKE OR WHAT??,"This cd was not worth the money i spent on it!The singing was horrible throughout!Lyrically my 6 year old daughter could write better than you (and probably have more interesting things to say)I could probably put up with only one track on the entire album but the rest is pure crap!Im not a big fan of your sister but as hard as it is to say it, leave the singing to your sister!"
1,MUSIC TODAY SUCKS,SHE'S NOT ROCKSHE'S NOT TALENTEDAND I THINK SHE LOOKS LIKE A MANWE NEED TO KILL MTV AND VH1
3,A surprisingly good power-pop confection.,"I agree very much with Amazon's review of this disc. (Read it if you haven't already.) I don't know (or care much) about her older sister Jessica. I didn't even know Ashlee existed until reading a review of Lindsay Lohan's debut CD, in which her name is dropped a few times. Even if you have little interest in Ashlee herself, I recommend this album to fans of hard-edged (if a bit polished and processed) indie-style pop. Sure, some of this isn't much more than bubblegum, but the music and vocals sound consistently inspired. Not bad for an ""insta-star."""
1,"shes very talented, shell help lagging cd sales","ashlee is more talented than posers like teh doors, david gilmour, queen, led zeppelin, and metallica!!"
3,I hate to admit but...,"its ok, and i like the songs autobiography, peices of me, and shadow. But the problem is i didnt want to like this CD. But she is tons better than Jessica."
5,*powerful!!*,I love the tone and the raspyness of Ashlee Simpsons voice! This girl couldn't of picked out better selections for her debut album! She'll be around for years to come and I can't wait to see whats in store for her!
1,"Major Poser Indeed, no rockstar","I dont own this cd. Its just another pop/rock wannabe rockstar chik trying to be rebellious. She mine as well be a comedian cuz she looks so damn funny. Look at the way she dresses. She should try being attractive for once. The only reason these singers go platinum is not what they can do, but who they are and who they are related to. If she wasnt Jessicas lil sister she wouldnt have made it. SHe needs to stop acting like a wannabe Joan Jett/Avril Lavigne but i like avril...."
1,Converted Garbage,I LOVE THIS CD! ITS LIKE SO COOL! J.S>'S SISTER?IN A SINGING CARRER?SWEEET! AND THE GUITAR WORK IS EVEN COOL!PSYCHE!!!!!!!!!hahahahaha you actually beleivced i liked this! I HATE IT!!!!!! what a joke.SHE CANT SING.SHE USES COMPUTER TECH. face the damn facts!
1,very very very BAD!,I would not recommend this album to anyone.Her voice is terrible especially on tracks 4 and 6.Do yourself a favor and pass this one up!
1,A girl who can't sing at all....,"After her blooper on SNL last fall, I had second thoughts of buying her CD. Then when I heard she got booed at the Orange Bowl, I went to find a clip of the incident. Sure as sh**, she CANNOT sing at all!!! She was singing off-key at the Orange Bowl. The producers definitely dissorted her voice on the CD just to make her sound good. Now I'm definitely not buying it because I heard recently she was booed at a concert or two she did. Ashlee, take my advice. Stop following in your sister's footsteps and find your own way. You won't make it as a pop singer."
1,Sad...Really Just Sad.,Awww...does Ashlee think she's a punk? That's so cute! Because she's not. She looks and sounds ugly. Her album is junk. And she lip-syncs everywhere and makes up stupid lies and thinks she can get away with it? Please.
2,A Few Sparks of Talent Flying Here and There,"Many of Ashlee's fans complain that people are comparing her to Jessica too much, but let's face it, whether you like it or not, we all know that Jessica is still a bit more talented than Ashlee. Ashlee looks like a sweet little girl but don't let her image fool you. She has some dark songs on this album like ""Shadow"" We're all hearing the over-played ""Pieces of Me"" right? She just can't manage to hit the high notes in the song like Jessica does in ""Angels"" Like I said, she does have a few sparks of talent flying here and there but her talent isn't steady. Even though she does hit some high notes on the album, they were just plain luck. But again, she is adorable!"
3,Hmmm,"Well by watching Ashlee's show on MTV, it's kind of hard to believe she actually sounds like that because everytime I see her sing, she either is saying she's terrible or she's oversinging...or she just is terrible. By the looks of the show, they make her seem really bad. On the album she doesn't sound bad..but is her voice doctored or what? Her songs aren't bad considering she wrote them and all. I think her cd is alright, but I'm just a little confused to whether how much of it is her real voice."
3,Ashlee Simpson,"I'm not particually a fan of Ashlee Simpson. Her music is just not my thing, and i'm not here to argue that shes not a corporate whore or anything (which she kinda is). Just dont be so harsh on the girl, The thing is Ashlee Simpson is young, and a young girl under the tight grasp of her parents and recording company, so it will take her time to really get a hold of the production time. Also a reviewer sayed she doesnt write any of her songs, which is not true. This is admirable, and more than what Avril Lavinge can say, as she has multiple helpers. Last, if you think MTV is horrible? Don't watch it! Oh you say that you watch it too make fun of it? Bullsh_t, MTV does suck, but i'm not going to blame it for the fall of the good music. So all this snob vs. poseur stuff has got to stop.PS: Make sure to pick up Beck's new cd Guero. American Music Club's Love Songs for Patriots, and the Kings of Leon. Love you."
2,You're not singing,"Ashlee Simpson could possibly have talent to be a REAL singer, but there is no way she is rock. Rock is more than screaming and wearing dark colors. Beyond her persona... She actually had a hand in writing the tracks on her disc, the problem is that the lyrics blow. The music is cheesy, similar, and blows, and I regret spending $15 on it. The only semi-good songs on the disc are the first 4 then the rest of the disc is droning. She is interesting, She is adorable, She doesn't deserve to have a record contract. The guy on her show even said,""You're not singing on these tracks,"" but they put the songs on the disc anyway. What is that? Well anyway, I give the girl her props for selling that crap like hot cakes. This goes to show that POP CULTURE MEANS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING."
2,I was not happy...,"I was not happy with the cd at all, I love her songs but I wish someone else was singing them. And then when I heard about what happened on SNL I was even more dissipointed:("
5,THE BEST CD EVER!!!,ASHLEE SIMPSON IS AMAZING. HER SONGS R AWESOME. THE LYRICS ARE AWESOME. THE WHOLE CD IS AMAZING. BUY IT!!!!
4,"Look out, Jessica-Ashlee's here.","I first heard Ashlee's album on MTV's The Leak and I must say that I'm impressed. I love her sound. She has a lot of great material here. My favorite songs and tracks that I feel shouldn't be missed: La La (I love the screaming thing she does in this), Surrender, and Unreachable. The rest of the tracks are nothing shabby, either. I enjoy this CD, I think Ashlee could really burn up the charts. I hope she does."
2,hard to decide,"sadly i ahve to say i was drawn in by the hype and i did listen to her album, i sure as hell didnt but it tho, and i have to say, i found some of it catchy. it's definetly not good enuf to buy, i wouldnt waste your money"
3,Good Voice?,"I never really liked Jessica Simpson but hearing her younger sister live I can see that Jessica has the talent in this family. And that ""Pieces of You"" song? I hate that pouty way she sings it. Please. If you're not writing or playing (instruments) your own songs then you should at least have a good voice to be concidered an entertainer. I know, I know... she co-write many of the songs blah blah blah. I'm sorry but when a teen girl ""co-writes"" a song with an older 20-30 year old man guess who's REALLY composing the song. And anybody who wears a t-shirt that says ""PUNK"" (in glitter no less), guess what, you are not punk. Just cause one of your back up guys has a mohawk doesn't give you street cred."
1,I forgot the title to my review - how unprofessional,"I hate it when I forget the words to what I didn't write.But seriously - this is a classy prostitute. So you guys can just shut up because she is Somebody - she's her own person. Thats why her album titles both identify that she is an individual. She's such an individual. She is her. One of a kind. and special.God don't make no junk. Ashlee ain't junk. she is her. And theses are her stories (written by someone else, but about her)."
5,Ashlee Simpson,welcome to the era of true artist. Miss Ashlee Simpson displays and pours out her true identity in her lyrics and music. Her album displays who she is and is a definite keeper in the CD player. Rock and pop sound great but tie it in with Ashlee Simpson and its nothing but plantinum!
4,Ashlee Rocks,"I think Ashlee's cd is really good. It appeals to pop fans and rock fans, because she definitely incorporates both into her music."
4,Good album!!!,"I bought Ashlee's album two days after it released and I immediately thought I was going to love it after listening to ""Pieces of Me"".I only listened to it once, and didn't like that many songs.But when I listened to it again, I liked it even better.My favorite songs are-AutobiographyPieces of MeShadowLaLaGiving It All AwayThis isn't the best album I own, but it is certainly a good one."
3,It's just pop.,"Autobiography is not profound, it's not artisitic, it doesn't provoke any thought or reaction.. it's just pop. And for a pop album, Ashlee Simpson delivers a half-descent effort.Sure she may not write the songs/music, and the album title is misleading, but how many pop artists these days are musicians really concerned about delivering a message or creating something artistic??Compared with the rest of the R&B; bulls*** we're being force-fed, this is not THAT bad.So many of the reviews for this album have actually been about Ashlee Simpson and her personality/reality show/sister etc etc.. but when did that stuff become the criteria for choosing music to buy... ??Buy this album if you want some radio-friendly pop/rock, but don't expect anything too thought provoking, amazing, or musically impressive, it's just pop after all."
2,Another Ashlee!!,Like Oh Mah God...Another Ashlee...like so many pretty girls are called Ashlee except this one like can sing! First of all like how can the song be like pieces of her? Isnt she like one whole like person? And last time i checked like autobiothingies were like BOOKS not a CD!! Like once i was like in my new red convertible and we were like all jammin to Britney's song 'Outragous'and then like Ashlee came on and she like totally like messed up our mood. And then i like remembered that she's Jessica Simpson's sister and how come she's like totally stealing the spotlight?! Like she is without a doubt like a very cute girl and everything but like her music...it's not like a word to be said on the internet but like it means...EWW!
5,Great CD,"No matter what others say, She did not get an album deal just because of her sister. She actually has talent unlike a lot of these younger siblings to stars like Jamie-lynn Spears. This CD has tons of variety in it and is great to listen to. I would definitly reccomend it and I can tell she is the new big star."
1,crap,"clearly people will buy anything. heard this cd at a friends house (her kid was playing it). this cd makes it plausible and PREFERABLE to be a Brittany fan! man this ""music"" is just painful."
1,Awesome album from a Rock Legend,She is so Amazing! And so hard kore rawk! It's insane!Her new album is gonna be totally hawt!(sarcasm)
4,CD is good but not great,"This CD was good but not as great as all the hoopla that was made over it. The first four songs rock and I also think that ''Love me for Me'' and """"Surrender'' are awesome too. The rest of the songs are O.K. but not that great which brings down my review from 5 stars to 4."
5,Ashlee simpson rocks,"This cd is so good! I love it...I usally listen to maroon 5 and chirstina but now that i have this CD it's never out of my stero. i might even buy a second one for my stero in my room. I love this cd. I think that there is alot o fpressures tat ashlee has over come and this is nothing like her sister. I think she has done a great job. This CD is a lil bit of a rocker/pop. there's alot of heart in the CD and you can tell that just by listing to some of her songs...like ""SHADOW""...she put alot of effort into this album and you can tell! I'm buying her next CD for sure..<Sash"
3,Decent,"This is not a horrible cd, but it isnt fantastic either. I think she's done well for herself considereing her sister's career and the troubles she probably went through, but there are a couple of you who think she wrote all her songs herself. WRONG...she helped with some...not one of these songs is completely written by AShless Simpson. Watch the show and she'll say me and whoever wrote this song... She's not that talented yet."
3,"good,but i prefer her older CDS","This is good, but I prefer Jessica's older CDs such as in this skin, and sweet kisses. Autobiography is by far my least favorite Jessica Simpson CD."
4,I'm a Jessica fan but I really like this CD,"This is for all the Jessica fans who are wondering if the should get Autobiography. If you like Jess for her upbeat songs-like me-YES ballads-probably not. My favorites are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 11. I really like how in Shadow she said ""dont feel sorry for me"" and ""i got more than any1 should"" I would have been really mad if she thought she had it so tough being second to jess and now being really famous. LaLa is really fun to scream along to. Love makes the world go round is kinda slow but i like itConclusion-Jessica fans of upbeat songs BUY THIS"
5,You guys r hilarious,"Ya kno what? I just think it's HILARIOUS how many ppl are SO damn jealous of Ashlee! Seriously, half the complaints here r ""Wahh it's not fair, sheee has a celebrity sister, :( boohoo that's the only reason she has success"". You guys just WISH u had that kind of priveledge & ur pissed that she does when u don't! Plz, get over it. The other half of these pathetic complaints r ""She can't sing for sh*t"" and all this bull, but seriously, lets see how you can sing! I'd really enjoy seeing what you would have to offer. Keep your jealous complaints 2 urself, for your own sake, plz!"
1,Hahahaha so bad,Ashlee Simpson sucks! You people need to learn this already!! She has no talent and she's the most unoriginal performer around. Pro-tools and a Hot Topic wardrobe do not a good musician make. Or even an authentic one at that.
1,Please....,"Let's start out honest: Ashley Simpson is nothing more than a slogan. Just a face to put in the album cover, and that's that.Now, let's see: - There is not one song in this album thatis really memorable or that may be rememberedin the future as something good- She can't play any instruments- She can't put three words together that makesenseSo why buy this album? If you really want good Rock and Roll, leave this so-called ""rock-chick"" alone and get Led Zeppelin II or Black Sabbath's Paranoid."
1,The World's Most Sarcastic Review!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(EVER!!!!),"I LOVE this album!! The songs are, like really moving! And now, I can proudly sit at the punk table in my school caf!!! Ashlee is like, so inspirational. It is like, really no fair that she was in Jessica's like, shadows. It's WAY cool that she had these people called The Matrix write her autobiography for her, and she gets credit for it. And, Ashlee, like, proved to me that like, brunettes aren't having less fun. Dark hair actually makes you a ROCKER, like ME!!! I LOVE my new hair color. It's like, cutting edge!! But OMG! People say the MEANEST stuff about Ashlee! Why? She can too sing, as lovely as a car over gravel!! Which, for us PUNKS is like, cool! Rock on,Ashlee!!P.S. What does lala on the kitchen floor mean? It sounds SO fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Buy Autobiography 2day!!!!!!!!!! Oops, gotta go! I'm late for CHEERLEADING PRACTICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!And that folks, is why NOT to buy this awful excuse for ""rock."""
4,ashlee simpsons autobiography is awesome!,"ashlee's cd is great..i listen to it all the time i can never get tired of hearing it..she is such a wonderful person and singer. u cant compare her to anyone else, she will be successful just by being ashlee simpson.."
4,Ashlee holding up the family name!,"Ashlee Simpson's autobiography is one of the summer's hottest albums. Filled with heart felt lyrics and Rock-in' melody's it was just what we needed. When I found out Ashlee Simpson was making an album, i have to admit I had my doubts I had been fan of her on seventh heaven but I wasn't quite sure she could make the transition from actress to musician. Boy was I wrong! This is what she should be doing. She's not trying to fit the mold of some other female pop stars she's out doing her own thing she's being original. With songs like ""pieces of me"" and ""shadow"" She's well on her way to becoming a Kick a** rock star."
1,Did someone say vocoder?,"Bouth this album and I completely regret it.Low quality production, singing and song writing.If anyone doesnt know what a vocoder is, its the piece of studi equipment that madonna and Jlo have made famous. It mixes a person voice with a synthesizer, basically it allows people who cannot sing to hold a key. Even still with the help of the vocoder, Ashlee's voice is still very bad. Avoid this release and looks elsewhere for good pop/rock music."
1,um.....,"If this is truly her Autobiography, then her life is pretty sad. I am all for new and fun young pop stars, but she has little musicality. She plays no instruments and writes no songs; hopefully, she will explore trhose areas. The nodes on her vocal chords are incredible and she needs to work on her technique. I liked the song ""Pieces of Me,"" but that was about it. Good luck to her on a new cd!!!!"
1,Ashlee Schmashlee,"Indeed, with this chick's lip-synching debacle, what was she thinking? What are we the general public thinking? Why do we elevate her and so many other non-musicians like her into stardom? The music world has become such a fashion show that it's not only more difficult for real musicians to gain any footing, but it's also incredibly nauseating. So Ashlee Simpson got caught lip-synching...what a shocker! The only respect this 'band' deserves is for its members who actually play instruments. The other reviewers who deem this girl as having ""exceptional talent"" must either be her relatives or the mentally defective. Her entire career is forced and preposterous. It is an insult to actual bands."
1,Who would pay money for this?,"It's bad enough the world is subjected to Jessica Simpson, but do we really need to have Jessica's far-less-talented sister shoved down our throats?Just because you are the sibling of somebody famous doesn't mean that you deserve to be famous too. Seriously, if this girl wasn't related to Jessica Simpson, do you think that any record company would give her the time of day? Enough said.Her meltdowns on SNL and the Orange Bowl just prove that she is totally untalented. A year from now, she'll be nothing more than a punch line to a joke and anyone owning a copy of this CD will be left feeling very, very embarrassed."
1,oh my buddha. she cannot sing for poo.,"her cd sounds decent probably because she recorded each track a gazillion times and selected the ones that didnt sound like chicken wailing.as many people noted, the fans booed her off stage at the orange bowl a couple days ago. deservingly so. she demonstrated that she has no sense of tone. and thus, to make up for her poo-poo voice, she decided wail her aweful hoarse voice and to thrust her [...] body all over stage.why is she so popular? i have no idea. she has no talent or skill whatsoever. she was lip-syncing on SNL... to the wrong song. so later, she blamed her band for messing up. good one. she needs to just shut up, quit the singing business, and just be glad that she is jessica's sister. she complains so much about herself being in her sister's shadow. but clearly, she is so much better off in her sister's shadow than being a complete loser-of-a-musician that she is."
1,judge her by snl,she gets all that for lip singing. she deserved it. and she lied. dont support a liar.
1,Ashlee Simpson Is The Worst Singer Ever!,"OMG! I can't stand her or her voice. Its just so anoying and even ""Pieces Of Me"" makes me want to hurl. Even the rumors about her lip syncing, I heard that she was loosing her voice or whatever. Her sister Jessica Simpson is way much better than her. I dont even know why Ashlee even got her own CD! And if she gets her second album, dont even buy that either. Waste of money. End of discussion."
4,Well worth it,Ashlee Simpson has created an amazing album. All of her songs are well written and instantly addicting. I play them repeatedly and it never gets old. She has a great voice and this album is awesome!
5,MAKE SURE TO PICK UP A COPY OF 2004'S BEST ALBUM,"IVE GOT SAY, FROM LISTENING TO SEAN PAUL TO G-UNIT, TO SIMPLE PLAN TO BEYONCE, FROM BRITNEY SPEARS TO USHER THIS ALBUM HAS GOT TO BE THE BEST I HAVE EVER-NO WORDS CAN EXPLAIN HER MUSIC ITS SO UNIQUE IN HER OWN WAY IT IS SUCH AN INSPIRING AND BREATH TAKING ALBUM. BE SURE TO PICK UP A COPY OF ASHLEE SIMPSON 'AUTOBIOGRAPHY' TODAY!!"
5,Ashlee Simpson Deserves More Credit,Ashlee Simpson deserves respect. Her cd is amazing if you do not like her music then don't listen to it. She has come a long way and she wrote everyone of her songs. That is way more than a lot of artist's can say. Ashlee Simpson has amazing lyrics that 19-24 years old can relate to. I can't wait for more Ashlee Simpson music.
1,you make me want to puke puke,"how this girl managed to get a record deal is questionable. Could it be that she's related to jessica simpson and paid her way to make this album, looks like it. She's just pop trash"
2,Heard it all before,"Granted the production of this album is great, the songs will have you singing along, but there is nothing here I haven't heard before. It's slick pop/rock taliored for teenage girls. It doesn't seem like one of those albums I'll be listening to years from now;I can throw it in the garbage as soon as I take it out of the stereo.Ashlee's emotion is admirable but she isn't unique. I think about Kim Deal* and Jennifer Finch* and shudder that many consider the harmless sentiments of Autobiography to be the apex of female rage and emotion ever expressed in song.*if these names are greek to you and you're proclaiming Ashlee's album the best thing you own, pity yourself."
1,SNL WHAT A SAD MOMENT,I AM TRYING TO BE FAIR. I WONDER WHAT THE REACTION WOULD HAVE BEEN IF HER FAN BASE HAD SHELLED OUT $50 OR $60 TO SEE SWEET ASHLEE IN A FULL BLOWN CONCERT ONLY TO HAVE HER LEAVE THE STAGE DUE TO A SMALL PROBLEM SUCH AS THE ONE ON THE SNL BROADCAST. ASHLEE IS ONE OF MANY IN THIS AGE OF MUSIC STARS WHO ARE VERY LIMITED IN THEIR ABILITY TO DELIVER THE GOODS LIVE. THEIR ARE A GOOD MANY TRULY TALENTED SINGERS WHO REMAIN UNSIGNED/LACK THE RIGHT PROMOTIONIAL TEAM.
5,A Review This Album Deserves,The only reviews for this album are from haters. Ashlee can sing better than some of the people ya'll like.. for example BRITNEY. Britney wishes she could reach these notes. AnywayAutobiography- 9/10Pieces of Me- 10/10Shadow- 9/10La La- 10/10Love Makes The World Go Round- 8/10Better Off- 9/10Love Me For Me- 8/10Surrender- 10/10Nothing New- 10/10 my favoriteGiving It All Away- 8/10Undiscovered- 9/10
4,very good,Though Ashlee may not be the best singer she is still trying and you have to give her props for that. She is a pretty descent singer and no one wants to give her credit for that. Her voice has improved since the snl accident. If you don't like her you don't have good taste in music. I am one of the fans that have still supported her since snl and you should too because if something like that happened to you wouldn't you need some support? So just give it a listen especially lala!
2,VERY VERY VERY BAD!!,"This album unfortunately is the worst purchase ive made this month. very bad music, it sounds like a rip off of Garbage and Hole. Too bad amazon wont allow returns :("
1,she just doesn't have it-and by it i mean talent,"this is what one could have expected from a clone of the simpson family-over produced, sleek and meaningless drivel of an album.how many words did ashlee write on her own for this cd?how many can she even sing?shes too busy milli vanilling ""her"" lyrics on national tv and acting like the next big thing on mtv to even consider using what thin amount of talent she may or probably doesnt have.she doesnt even have the good looks of her sister-ashlee, makeup doesnt kill ugly.sorry.ryan cabrera must dig over colored femullets.whatever.this is garbage in every way,shape,and form.want real music with real talent and emotion?check out NIRVANA,SHINEDOWN,SILVERCHAIR,SEVENDUST,DEFTONES!"
1,this is the kinnd,this the kind of cd amazon.com user kindofnot.com likes. its stupid and dumb and kindofnot.com thinks its punk rock. buts inot.
1,OMG,"Ashlee Simpson is totaly smart and talented. That blooper on SNL was just part of her show cuz it was just a skit and it fooled alot of people into thinking she can't sing! But she totally can sing. She can sing better than Mariah Carey. Plus, she has less ego than her.Also, she did not need to ride on the coattails of her older sister to like be famous. You haters are like totally jealous of this grrls talent. All you need to stepoff. She's like the coolest thing eva. The next Aretha Franklin even. The next Madonna. The next Britney SPears. And Birtney is oh so totally talented fer sure!P.S. - I meant to give this 5 stars, but I hit the wrong button and now I'm not able to change it. It's DEFINITELY a 5 star cd!"
1,You're kidding right?,"Man, when I first saw her on TRL (only because a buddy of mine was flipping through the channels), I was like ""What the hell is this crap""? I wanted to watch TRL again only because I couldn't believe what I saw the first time.Then I looked at TRL again and that's when I saw the video ""Pieces Of Me"". That was when I heard singing that was uninspired and flat. She also looked jittery and nervous throughout the entire video.And then I went down to the steaming pile of garbage known as FYE to hear the sound samples of the album. That's when I heard some idiotic lyrics (""You can throw me like a boomerang, I'll come back and beat you up""), and a song which sounded like an AC/DC ripoff.If you want good female singing, look no further than Jill Scott, Joss Stone, Fantasia and Rebecca St. James. These are women who actually try to sing without some BS computer fixing all the bad notes and things like that. Your ears will thank you."
1,PLEASE SAVE YOURSELVES!!!!!!!!,"I got this for a present, never listened to it but when I did I thought barking dogs were better. She sucks. She is TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!"
1,hello kitty,"I have a sweet little cat, and you know what? Her meowing and purring sounds better than ashlee"
1,"She's talented, alright!","...talented enough to vomit all over the stage while her song is playing in the background. She was caught lip-synching! FACE THE FACTS. BTW, Be sure to catch her next tour for ""I Am Me."" She's touring with Milli Vanilli. Those are two related artists, alright."
1,ashlee simpon,ashlee simpson is a horrible artist and should NOT have an album! she clearly cannot sing (as she has proven to us) and makes me sick. she needs to stop polluting our radios with her mind numbing crap. she's horrible and i feel sorry for people who get sucked into her gimick and think she can sing and perform. she sucks and i would not buy this cd or anything else of hers. do yourselves a favor!
2,"""Nothing New""","Recently we have seen an explosion of ""chick rockers"". You have the folk-like Michelle Branch, the teen-angst of Avril Lavigne and now we have punk wanna be, Ashlee Simpson. I'm not a fan of any of them to be frank but Ashlee Simpson's debut ""autobiography"" has to be the worst I've come across. More Hilary Duff than Courtney Love, Ashlee belts (or attempts to anyways) catchy hooks and one typical chorus after another. In the end Ashlee comes off desperate to make an image with her lyrics (""I'm the baddest girl in this messed up world"", ""you make me wanna La la in the kitchen on the floor"") and fails to seperate herself from her pop peers.If looking for a good pop/rock album I recomend early Liz Phair (whip-smart) or Fiona Apple (Tidal)."
1,this album is total crap!,im pissed off that i actually bought this cd!this album is terrible.she lacks any singing ability. thats all!
5,ASHLEE ROCKS,"You know what, not everyone is going to even give her a chance. But I really enjoy her show and her music. She's so Real! So many artists have such an act, and you can tell she is very genuine. She's so sweet, and her music is dope! It's this really happy, cute rock out music. It's not super hard, or even trying to be. No one gives Avril a hard time. Now there's a try hard. I like Avril's music, but seriously if we're talking about 'corporate image consultants' and so forth like I have been reading in these reviews, take a look around. Bottom line is every single artist or band on the planet has a gimmick."
5,worth buying even if you haven't heart it yet!,"Ashlee Simpson's debut CD is INCREDIBLE. Listening to it you'd never know it was her first album. All 12 songs are great, and as she said, I can really tell a lot about Ashlee from listening to it. Listening to Shadow then listening to LaLa, two totally different songs, it shows how diverse she is and how anything she sings sounds great."
4,Ashlee's CD,"This cd is a really great, fun cd. I love to listen to it, turned all the way up, in my car, with the windows down. All of the songs are fantastic!!"
5,U Need 2 Buy This!!!,"I was so glad I went out to WalMart on release day and bought this album! I fell in love with the single ""Pieces of Me"" and I had no doubt that the album would live up to the singles success. The songs on ""Autobiography"" fit all types of styles and moods. A major plus to the songs is that all were written by Ashlee herself. The beats on the cd are awesome, and I highly recommend this cd to anyone. No matter what kind of music you are into, ""Autobiography"" you will enjoy!"
1,Crappity crappity crap!!!!!,"This is a s***ty album, but I have heard MUCH worse. But still, this album sucks! I agree with watty420. I'd pay to see her naked, but I wouldn't even THINK of listening to her music, let alone BUYING it!!! For good music listen to Sepultura, Lacuna Coil, Death, Iced Earth, Megadeth, Hatebreed, Enbalmer, etc."
5,Good stuff,Ashlee simpsons Autobiography is great all I have to say is you will love almost all the songs in the Cd. The song Shadow ashlee sings about how she was left out and didn't get all the attention. This whole CD is about her life her problems her breakup her family and her new boyfriend the song Pieces of me was about him.LaLa is the best song on the Cd also her show is good to on Mtv
5,Inspiring and Fun,"I found Ashlee Simpson' debut album ""Autobiography"" to be inspiring and truly touching. In some songs, such as LALA and Love for Me, she shows her fun side which many can relate to. But many of the songs are beautiful and relatible, some being Shadow, Unreachable and Undiscovered. Many teenagers can relate to difficulty of finding themselves and also in living up to others expectations. She blends incredible lyrics with a punk/pop sound that is sure effect everyone in a postive way."
1,Awful just awful,"All i have to say is remember the SNL lip-synching fiasco.This chick makes Milli Vanilli look respectable. At least they didn't pretend to ""Rock""."
1,It's all the same,"Ashlee Simpson, Clay Aiken and other American Idol rejects, Twitney Spears, Lindsay Lohan, and the most overrated of them all, the equally undertalented and overexposed Jessica Simpson: These are poor excuses for music and if the aforementioned slop is all that record companies can market today, they should just pack it up and forget about it.Whatever happened to club scouting to find some struggling *musicians* who can sing, play instruments, and write their own material? Is that another thing of the past?Whatever the Simpson sisters did to get ""reality"" shows on MTV (besides the fact that their father is media savvy), I'll never know.The ""music"" industry has been in such sad shape for the longest time ... and the future doesn't look that much brighter."
1,Ashleeeeeeeee Simpson looks like a man.,"God, she's so ugly. Her hair looks like it's been burned or something. I'm so sick of seeing her on MTV taking up the time that good s*** could be on. I wanna teach her to sing one of these days but she'd probably just act like a two year old and run around messing with things so forget it. Her album is terrible and her voice is just aweful. How many times do we have to hear that stupid ""Pieces of me"" song on the radio?! By the way, I thought Josh's review was funny. I wish somebody'd throw the pieces of her away 'cause they're littering this planet."
2,oh man,Can you say one of the most over rated artists out there? Her lyrics are very random and sometimes make absolutely no sense whatsoever. They have medication for acid reflux by the way
1,This album is not good!,It's funny how so many 5 star reviews pop out of nowhere in 1 day and each persons review history has only the review of this album!????Hmmmm yeh I think there's this weirdo keep on using a bunch of acounts reviewing this horrible album 5 star reviews over and over and you can tell it's the same person from how he post the review it's adenticle to the others!This album is just horrible it has no substance and poor writing plus Ashlee has no voice what so ever maybe a talking voice but deff not a singing voice!This album is not worth it!
1,No Respect for Music,"I caught one episode of the Ashlee Simpson Show. You know, the one where she can't sing live and goofs off with her friend while the 'grown-ups' add strings to one of her songs. How is she a recording artist? If you haven't ever had a live performance and you don't take music seriously, why are you in the business?"
1,soon this won't be able to happen,"Record labels are crumbling because of the internet and soon enough they won't be able to do things like this. If a dying person was trying to sell me this cd for a dollar so he could live, I wouldn't give him a second glance. She doesn't write any of ""her"" songs, sing any of ""her"" songs, or even look attractive (currently an attribute which can single-handedly elevate you to stardom).It's ok though, people don't know any better. The radio and television are the source of all evil in the music world. In time, the record companies will fall because they can no longer serve a purpose to talented artists. The internet makes it possible to promote your cd without the help of a label, so only ""artists"" like ashlee simpson need the record companies to tell people that they're talented.Enjoy your new Ashlee Simpson cd, your soul is escaping slowly out your ears."
5,LOVE IT!,"I would have never purchased this album if I hadn't been watching ""Newlyweds"", and caught some of Ashlee's reality show right after. I heard some snippets, and every one I heard, I loved.Jessica's baby sister is all grown up and tells a story through each song. I think we all can relate to in this CD titled ""Autobiography"".The hit single ""Pieces of Me"" is one of my favorites, but there is also ""Shadow"" a song about the slight twinge of jealousy she had over her sister and her fame. ""Lala"", a funky song which she went all out and showed us her wild side, and ""Better Off"" which is more along the lines of ""Pieces"" but with a slight twist.I think this is a great debut, and while I don't think Ashlee is the greatest of singers, the songs take away from that fact."
2,Bad Album. First album I've Ever Bought That I Don't Like.,"Two stars for Ashlee this time. The only tracks I like on this album were ""Autobiography"", ""Pieces Of Me"", ""Shadow"", and ""Love For Me"". The rest is... let's leave it at that. I am not going to resell it, I am going to keep it somewhere in my music library because I paid for it and if I get rid of it in any way I'll be wasting my money because this CD, although it was used one time, it's not worth much. Sorry Ashlee. ""I Am Me"" was much better."
1,Jealous?,"Jealous? Not really. Just puzzled and deeply annoyed.I can't answer for others, but what annoys me is that there are LOTS of other, far more talented people who will NEVER get the promotion and publicity they deserve. (And I'm NOT talking about myself or any members of my family.) When someone with no discernable talent whatsoever gets this kind of insane saturation promotion by the record industry, it's a fair question to ask why. There are girls at my local high school who can sing and dance and play guitar much better that Ashlee can. So, like an earlier reviewer asked, WHY HER?"
3,Meh...,"I'll admit, I do like Ashlee Simpson. I like ""Pieces of Me"" and ""La La,"" but it seems to me that she's trying to hard to be different from her sister. Her attempt of being ""rock"" has turned many people, especially the true ""rockers,"" against her, and believe me, they have plenty reason to. If you've seen her on ""The Ashlee Simpson Show"" on MTV, you'd know that her constant whining and her excuse of the acid reflux disease is completely and utterly annoying. Although I do like some of her music, she is nothing but a poser and needs to quit the ""rocker"" act. Then I, and maybe some other people, will have more respect for her. But after the Saturday Night Live incident, that is not assured."
5,Best Cd ever!,As soon as i saw Ashlee on her show i loved her! And i knew as soon as the cd came out i would have to own it! So i bought it and i swear this is the best cd i have ever owned! There is so many different types of songs for everyone! Ashlee simpson rocks so i'm telling everyone that if you dont get this cd..you are really missing out. :)
5,Something for everyone,"This album is very diverse, it has something for everyone, and it's very eclectic, it's an amazing album. Definitely a must have in everyone's music collection :)"
1,you make me wanna throw up,"after watching her show and seeing the many attempts it took to hold the right note for pieces of me.....after watching her blame her band for her lip-syncing on snl......after watching her f*ck up lala at the orange bowl.....i've realized that ashlee simpson, you cannot sing....no no.....you cannot sing....the only reason why and how she could make this album was because of her sister jessica....who actually scares me when she sings.....the seizures must stop when you try to reach those high notes, jessica...back to ashlee....i'm giving the album a 1 only out of mercy for your short-lived career......your ""rhymes"" are terrible....good luck with the 11 minutes of fame you have left on mtv and the radio"
1,FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE.....THE MILLI VANILLI OF THE 2000'S,"Ashlee Simpson is the fakest person in the industry, and is all John Shanks fault for keepin' endorsing all this people...I'm sorry Mr. Shanks workin' with stars like Etheridge and Crow is one thing, selling yourself to thangs like Simpson, is to have lil dignity. This albums sux big time, cos it has written FAKE all over. And even if she have written and perform all the songs, they sound the same after LALA, I actually own the record."
2,I'll give her two stars for trying.,"Ok, I'm cutting her some slack. Can she really sing? I don't know because she seems to be ""screaming"" and forcing her vocal cords over music that sounds way to processed. Each song on the album plays this way. It is not fair to compare her though to other singers in her age group or genre. Each artist has his/her own style. I'm sure that Miss Simpson has some talent, it is just that this album doesn't quite reveal it. My friend bought this for me awhile back thinking I would like it. It really rates high on my crap-o-meter. I may give her another try someday. Maybe she just hasn't hit her mark yet."
1,A Talentless Family...,"Jessica Simpson is a Joke, no two ways around it. So when I heard her sister was coming out with her own C.D., I had to check it out for laughs. It exceeded my super low expectations alomst right away. Why do these talentless simpson girls keep getting second chances when there are REAL talents out there waiting to be discovered? It boggles the mind. bottom line, I HATE THIS ALBUM, and by no means should you purchase it...unless you accually like formulaic, mass produced garbage shoved down your throat by the good people at Mtv..."
1,I find the one star superfluous.,"Wow. So it has really come down to this. How embarassing. This is the most contrived, force-fed collection of digitally-recorded swill I have ever beheld. How sad that young people are presented with this horrible scourge of sounds. I am embarrased for people who buy this sort of thing. I mean, she doesn't even sing. SHE DOESN'T SING. She is a stuffed animal created by a company. Without her sub-100 IQ possessing sister (not to mention her stage parents), she wouldn't even have an album out. This is just so.....sad."
4,A pleasant surprise,"I will admit I was a total cynic when I first bought her album, but after a few songs, I was estatic that I had. Ashlee's voice may not be that of an ideal pop princess, but she kicks ass with what she has. The album also has a great mix of songs, from punky ""Lala"" to mellow ""Undiscovered"". Kudos to Ash for a job very well done."
5,Ashlee Simpson,"Ashlees music is great, you can relate to every song on her albumn. She is way better than Jessica, she has more of a punk/rock vibe. Anyways, everybody needs this Cd!"
5,Ashlee Simpson is smashing.,"In Ashlee's CD, Atuobiography, you can hear hurt, love, happiness, and everything in between. Ashlee has rocking music, as well as amazing lyrics. This CD is a must have!"
5,Ashlee Rocks!,This is an amazing album! It's exactly what the music world has been waiting for! A girl to rock out like days of Pat Benatar and kick some vocal ass! This CD is absolutely awesome.
5,Not just a Rubber Stamp Pop Princess,"I've watched 7th Heaven since it started and enjoyed watching Ashlee on it, but it was a real treat to be able to listen to her music and know she sings from her heart her way and didn't back down on what she wanted. What she got was a Number 1 record. I went to four stores on the day after it was released and they were all sold out and were giving rain checks. I'm looking forward to seeing her in concert. Buy this record you'll love it!"
4,People are so silly...,"First of all, you people shouldn't be comparing Ashlee to her sister, Jessica. Just because they are sisters doesn't mean their cds are in the same genres. That is like comparing apples to oranges. Besides, I always personally felt that writing your own music wins half the battle of being an artist which makes Ashlee more of an artist than Jessica. But whatever everyone is entitled to their own opinion. In my opinion, I like this cd alot. Ummmm yeah."
3,Deep Meaning with a Gutsy Debut Album!,"Yes, she is young and has a big sis that may have helped her get her own mtv show to help promote her album, but she truly does have talent. ""Pieces of Me"" was her own concept and she wrote most of the song. Lets give her some credit where credit is do!She definetly has talent! I personally love her Deep Huskey voice. I find it different, ingtruiging and refreshing. Her voice is original. I think she has a lot of talent and if she ispersistant on growing as an artist, I think she will go far with or without jessica or mtv. USA Today cut her up to shreds. However, I don't agree at all with there review! They are wrong on this one! She is the New Lita Ford!"
1,"OMFG!!! THE, LYKE, BEST ALBUM EVARRR!!!!!111","Oh, Ashlee! You are so wonderful! Your music has so much meaning! And your voice? Forget Madonna, Aretha, or Alicia Keys, she blows them right out of the water! Buy this now!!!Actually, I was blowing smoke up your a.s.s. in that first paragraph and the title. The exact opposite of what I said there is the truth. Aretha, Madonna, and Alicia Keys are real artists with talent and songwriting skills, and Ms. Franklin could smoke Ashleeeee's vocal chords with one high note. Please, do music a favor. Do not buy this if you care about your ears. Please: buy something, ANYTHING! Just not this."
5,Say what you want,"I hate how people can be so negative. So what if she has a famous sister, and so what if you don't think she has the greatest voice, get over it. If everyone in this world were ""perfect"", this would not be a very fun place to be. I have this CD, and I happen to like it. She is just being herself, a 19 year old. I think as she gets older her music will get better too."
3,A Little Too Much Ashlee in My Face...,"Ok, I wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt and try it. (I bought the cd for $6 total on Ebay) When I popped in the cd, I was a little put off. Dark punk stuff? Is that what she thinks that is? The music (the band) itself was awesome, her voice added to it was slightly confusing. I noticed more of a touch of Avril-like lyrics to a couple of songs, but not anything worth getting excited over.(Yes, I realize that everyone and their sister has something bad to say about Ashlee, but I promise I'm rating her music,not her...)I tried not to be too negative though--all I can really say is that you have to frown and analyze the whole cd several times before you can sort of smile and say that it's decent. I caught on to some catchy beats and sort of liked it. BUT--Ashlee's howling, scratchy voice can grate on your nerves if you listen too much, so be careful if you take the jump."
1,"For the Love of God, Stop Buying This Crap","Don't you folks understand that if you keep buying this crap, the music industry will keep putting it out? You must be the same people buying CDs from American Idol singers. You have the worst taste in music. The music industry is spoon-feeding you the same recycled garbage year after year. When are you going to fight back and demand something truly original? There are NO role-models in pop music."
5,Ashlee is pretty cool,"I've noticed that a lot of people are saying all this crap about her music.. HATERS!!... I can honestly say that 95% of the songs on this album are great.. They are catchy and sound very cool.. Please dont listen to all the negative people out there.. They are just talking smack because she lip syncked or however u spell it on SNL.. Everyone does it; Madonna, Britney Spears, Janet Jackson, Christina Aguilera blah blah blah.. But anyways, listen to the album youself.. YOU'LL LOVE IT."
1,VERY BAD!,I Thought she might be okay because she dated Ryan Cabrera and I like his music. I was not at all right. She can't write songs and she is not very good at singing at all. I didn't like Jessica's singing so I thought that Ashlee would be better but she isn't...not even close. This CD is a waste of money and time.
2,Not as bad as Jessica Simpson - 2.5 stars,"Ashlee Simpson's CD Autobiography is somewhat of a bubblegum grunge style, which makes her sound a little different from her peers - but the style doesn't work very well. There are only three songs that stand out - ""Pieces Of Me,"" ""Love Makes The World Go Round,"" and ""Nothing New."" And ""Love Makes The World Go Round"" has a melody that's a lot like Jimmy Eat World's ""The Middle."" The song ""Surrender"" sounds like Hole for youngsters who aren't ready for Hole's music. ""La La"" has a good beat, but sounds forced lyrically. And ""Shadow"" doesn't really make me emotional. Ashlee's father had a role in making Ashlee famous. At least Ashlee's CD isn't as boring as Jessica's CDs, though. And her vocals are versatile and go against the girly vocals trend. I bought this CD based on ""Pieces Of Me,"" and while I now know I could have gotten something better, there are songs that might make me listen again."
4,VERY good album..,"I wouldn't say its a great album but its pretty damn good. No matter how much people say its garbage, or that she has no talent, (yes and I know everyone's entitled to their opinion), but its #1 on the charts for a reason, and its not because of her sister or anything like that, its because she actually has a good voice... although I don't think she can compare with the vocal stylings of her sister, shes still pretty damn good.Just my opinion...."
2,Can You Say Cheesy?,"I found this CD to be a wooden, plastic performance by Ashlee. Most of her songs didn't even have that much meaning to them. In fact, I believe that she lipsings. She has a very raspy, raw voice. Better luck next album, Ashlee!"
3,All Right for First Album,"It was alright for her first album could of been a bit better but I'm sure she'll grow within time with her music and within in her music she a ok in my book, main songs I like are:1.)La La2.)Unreachable3.)Giving it all away4.)Undiscovered"
1,pop music has just taken a turn for the worse,"man.. back in tha day pop music was the beatles, rolling stones, more recently nirvana, pearl jam, red hot chili peppers. and now 2004/2005 we have ashlee simpson.. this girl is kinda pretty but in all honesty, completely talentless (in music at least). that ""i wanna lala"" song is horrendous! it's just sooo horrible. and as if the song wasn't enough, she had to make a video for it! somebody explain to me what that video is about. she pushes and shoves her friends around while going from one place to another? it's just so dumb and mindless.. so everyone, DON'T buy this album. just download pretty pictures of her or something."
1,"My ears, my poor poor ears!!!","What did I do to deserve actually thinking this might have been good!?!?!?!?!?!? Let me make this short and sweet, well almost short and definately not sweet.Ashlee Simpson is like all the other pop star singers sisters or younger siblings that decided, ""Hey, I want to be just like my big sis, bro, or cousin because being rich and famous already since I am related to her/him isn't enough. Now I have to go and make a CD, a TV show, and dye my hair to make it look like I am a rebel/innovator.""Puh-lease! I think you already proved what you can do Ashlee after your little SNL show. Nice dance by the way.Dont buy this, dont be a sheep or cow being led to the slaughter, just be glad that in a few years this chick will come to her senses and apologize for making this crap worthy title of an album. I know I will be waiting to take her back with open arms, NOT!!!!!Go ahead, click the unhelpful button, I dare you!"
1,"shadow, love me for me, undiscovered, mom i'm hungry too...","jessica is to ashley as metallica is to william hung man, jessicas a lot better, and this entire ablulm is about 2 things: 1: ashleys love life 2: jessica. jessicas hotter than her, so ashley got the worst of both worlds cuz she cant sing either. if she got a lil bit more original and wrote some interesting songs this albulm could be good. i dont know wat people c in pieces of me. on monday shes waiting, tuesday she fading on wendsday she cant sleap, but no matter wat day it is, she can sing."
1,Terrrible,"It's no wonder she lip sync'd on SNL. This is the worst corporate music ever made up, no what her sister is also right up ther with her."
1,Propaganda,Do you really MTV is the cultural genesis that it claims to be? It is just another corporate brainwashing product. This album is proof of that. Talentless. also mist cliche title for an album. The show is advertising for the album and vice versa. 99% of music on MTV is worthless. If you want real punk listen to sex pistols or clash.
3,It's..... Ok,"The album really isn't that great. I've never been anywhere near a fan of Jessica Simpson, but when I heard her sister was releasing an album I thought it would be awful. Then I heard ""Pieces of me"" and liked it very much. That song is great, so is ""Autobiography"", ""Love makes the world go round"". Those are the songs that stad out, nothing from there is really that good, its a bit repetitive. The song ""LaLa"" its just creepy to hear a really young artist sing ""You make me wanna Lala/ on the kitchen, on the floor/ I'll be a french maid"", she's so young to be singing that. Overall its a good start and she will improve."
2,This cd is completely Toe-up!!,"Purchased this cd 2 days ago and after listening 2 times, i have to say it completely , totally is NOT GOOD. If youre not a 10 year old girl then this cd is not for you. I hope your next album is 100 times better than this crap!"
4,Don't Listen to the Critics...,"Don't listen to the critics. This is a great album. This album is way better that some of the pop crap that has been coming out latley. If you watch her Mtv show than you should know what you are buying. She is orginal and does write her own song (unlike some people). Give her a chance, this is a solid debut album. And if you are expecting a biproduct of Jessica Simpson you are not going to get it on this album. Rock on Ashlee.."
1,It doesn't even deserve 1 star,She can't sing. Her music is horrible. Everything about it is horrible. Everybody who says she has any talent at all is horribly mistaken. Talent is not having a famous big sister and grossly attempting to sing a song about subjects you know nothing about. She discusts me. I shouldn't even waste this much space on her. She's repulsive.
2,"I prefer Jessica simpson, Ashlee is orrible...","This cd is ugly indeed, everything equal and monotonous!! It is not a beautiful and delicate rock (as Avril Lavigne or Hialry Duff).I find very beautiful only 3 songs :PIECES OF Me - GIVING IT ALL WAY - LOVE FOR ME!!"
5,Hmmmm....,Ashlee Simpson is hot. I don't really know what she sounds like because whenever she comes on tv i prefer to put it on mute.
1,"This is a Product, this is not an Album of Music!","MTV has fooled millions and now it's paying off. You are paying because they have sucked you into the commercials that they air 24 hours a day. Every minute of programming is a commercial, whether labelled ""reality show"" or not, there's a product in the works that they want you to buy. Ashlee Simpson is just a karoke singer with a famouse sister, but so many were fooled into thinking that they ""needed"" her album, this product for one reason or another. If you like her, that's fine, enjoy! But please look into all the thousands of struggling, talented artists that would blow you away! Norah Jones, has actual talent, Mindy Smith and East Mountain South, all these ladies have some quality and talent to offer, don't settle for this B-rate plastic, go for the real porcelain and you won't be dissappointed!"
1,Diable,"I agree 100% with the reviewers ""the End"" and ""Huffman"". How can anyone call what is being regurgitated by these so-called ""superstars"" music? I suggest that the category ""0"" (zero) star(s) be added to the rating system since such garbage does not even qualify to get a 1 star (I had to give it a 1 star in order to submit my review)! Last but not least, how times change: almost 15 years ago, Milli Vanilli were crucified for basically doing the same thing, yet Ashlee gets a second chance and there is no uproar from the music industry... Ah, that's right, it is the one peddling this junk! Duh!"
1,go away yes-men,I see what's going on here. Ashlee's pr people and daddy dearest are giving her 5 star reviews on amazon. I aint falling for it! Stop singing or you're going to make me deaf!
1,ughhhhhh......,"i fed up with the media trying to decide what is popular or not! ashlee simpson does not have any talent at all and we should not have to listen to her stuff. my friend has this album but it totally sucks, the lyrics are babyish, in fact a baby could have written 'dirtier' lyrics for Lala!plz take my advice and do not waste your money on this, get something better like Hilary Duff's Fly or Lindsay Lohan's Speak."
1,Pathetic CD,"Don't buy this cd.Don't lisnen to this cd.Don't talk about this cd.Don't think about this cd.don't look at this CD.The reason i say this is because Ashlee was alot of peoples idol(me)but i found out she don't sing any of these songs!I hated her music right afterwards.I don't really like pop but i did like Ashlees music but not anymore.I would not listnen to this CD it would be a waste of time it would be 40 mins of your life you could never get back...Buy cds like JoJo,Avril,Hillary Duff,Gwen,or my fav Green Day.They are the real deal......."
1,I think ive heard this music somewhere else before?,"Halfway through the album, the recipe gets repeated and you find yourself yawning despite the hooks. Not recommended! pass this one by and wait for better music."
1,Garbage,"Must be nice to have a career handed to you with no work put in to achieve it. This person is a disgrace to real musicians and talented singers who work thier whole life and are never given a chance. The funny thing is that she can't fake the fact that she is talentless...The SNL thing, and the halftime show that she got boo'd at. LOL that was exactly that she deserved. I can't believe that people buy this junk."
1,Ashlee's artistic ability keeps on growing,"Not only were we blessed with this wonderful metal CD, but now will we see Ashlee at her artistic peak when she poses nude on the cover of her next album to save her pathetic 15 minutes of fame."
1,"Not very good, but very cute girl!!","Well Ashlee, youre very cute but not a very good musician.I wish you were better than your sister because i absolutely hate her but u turned out to be 100 times worse than her, which i hate to say! On tracks 3,5 and 7 you sound like youve never sang before in your life. The music is cheesy and your lyrics pretty much suck! sorry :O("
1,Manu-fractured,"Ashlee Simpson. Lindsay Lohan. Jennifer Lopez.Somewhere, Milli Vanilli must be saying, ""Wow, we don't feel like such complete talentless hacks anymore!"""
1,Stunning...just mind-blowing,"I simply cannot believe people actually like this girl. SHE CANNOT SING! I mean, she can't hit a note to save her life. Listen to her tone, her pitch - awful. She's riding her (extremely talented) sister's coat tails, but it won't be long before the whole world catches onto the fact that she has no talent of her own. The punk image is clearly a way to distinguish her from Jessica - which is understandable because something has to draw attention away from her ""voice."" I'm sure she's a very nice person, but I would rather listen to a dying goat than to Ashlee Simpson. That is, if I could even tell the difference."
1,The COMMERCIAL ALBUM!,"I can only say: WONDERFUL...ASHLEE SIMPSON has made the album with excellent lyrics and excellent vocals...the riffs and melodies are excellent...OK...all of those who listen to good music like Led Zeppelin, Megadeth, Metallica, BLACK Sabbath, Helloween, or Sonata Arctica...this is your new idol: ASHLEE SIMPSON!!! Why would you need Led Zeppelin anymore...this is the perfection!!!"
1,Jessica's Ugly-Ass Sister,"Kinda-like Haylie Duff! She can't sing, can't dance and can't stand next to her sister without looking like she crawled out from underneath a truck. Her getting busted lip synching on SNL and then getting booed for her awful ""real"" singing at the Orange Bowl was wonderful! I wonder when she will finally give up!?!? Probably not before the industry gives up on her."
3,lollipop?,it doesnt see where i am hiding. maybe i should eat the moon. but why do i know what is not to ummm what am i writing. i know the marker is wet. how old is that bike? canned tomatos are icy so watch your golf clubs. gizmo is a pool i see in my ear.
3,She certainly is no Tina Turner or Anastacia!,"Overall, I thought it was a decent album that did show some effort. However, she most certainly needs to go back & be taught how to give a proper live proformace because she can't do one! Some vocal training would not hurt either! If you are looking for an awesome Hard Rock album, get Anastacia's third album, self-titled ""Anastacia."" It has already gone more than 4 times platinam in Europe! Overall, rating: 2.8 stars. Peace."
5,Good beginning!,"This girl has something of talent, although I don't judge for that reason because the truth if to my I like her music I care an ass if makes PLAYBACK, the best song it is the one that goes to make its next simple Lalala it is sticky, Shadow and pieces Of hopes for Myself in its second Album it improves."
1,The lesser one out of the Simpson sisters,This CD is so horrible. She will always be in the shadow of Jessica because she is 100x better than she is. She's gonna be a one hit wonder. Warning. Do not buy this album.
1,bad bad bad bad bad bad,"the entire simpson family is a bunch of ugly not talented pseudo-celebrities who are bitter because britney and avril did it better than both jessica and ashlee respectively. do not buy this album. do not support this white trash family full of nothing but terrible, pop rejects."
1,ASSLEE SIMPSON SUCKS,"Ashlee & her ugly boyfriend Ryan Cabrera are nothing more than poseurs. Don't try to act all hardcore when you sound identical to Hillary Duff and Britney Spears. At least those two don't try to fake who they are. People like Ashlee, Avril and Fefe (along with all those other pop punk boybands) should be shot for fooling the idiotic masses into believing they're real musicians. The only real musicians are the song-writers writing this ""music.""If you want real hardcore go buy the new Dillinger Escape Plan album or wait for the new Converge."
1,DO NOT BELIEVE THE HYPE! IT'S ALL FAKE!,"Ashlee Simpson is nothing more than a talentless, ugly little girl who is famous because of her older dumb sister. Ashlee's chin gives Kirk Douglas a run for his money and I haven't seen a shnozz that big since Adrien Brody. Despite hundreds of manhours using Pro-tools and a world class team of songwriters and producers behind her, Ashlee still sounds like nothing but absolute garbage.Also the positive reviews are fake and were written by Ashlee streetteam members. Do not believe any of them. Notice how they are ambiguous and the reviewers have never reviewed anything else on Amazon. These idiots probaly haven't even listened to this vapid garbage but get points and free ""stuff"" for writing these fake 5-star reviews. Ashlee has no real fans and Geffen has to sink this low just to get people to believe this girl is actually good."
1,nonono,"NO! ashlee has a horrible voice! she cant sing at all, the one star is for cathy tunes like ""peices of me"""
1,please stop the madness,"Her voice sounds like a cat with a huge hairball caught in it's throat. It's so raspy and horse sounding, that it is unappealing. In her hit single, ""Pieces of Me"" I think that she actually created brand new notes that didn't exist before.She attempts to achieve that Avril vibe, but she doesn't realize that we ALREADY have an Avril who, although more talented with a better voice, is equally annoying. There is not enough room in the music buisness for one of them, let alone both.Ashlee should have just stuck to acting. She was great on 7th Heaven, and fit that role perfectly. By trying to become a singer, it just proves that she is jelous of her sister's fame."
1,Peter R.,"""How do you know everything I'm about to say?"" asks the brunet member of TV's other cartoon family named Simpson, seemingly oblivious to her debut album's predictable script. ""La La"" casts Jessica's younger sister Ashlee as a barely legal temptress wanting to ""Make la la in the kitchen on the floor/I'll be a French maid when I meet you at the door."" Ironic or not, it's creepy. The music's mundane melange of Avril-ish brat pop and Sheryl Crow cod rock reaches its nadir on ""Love Me for Me,"" an anemic rip of AC/DC's ""Back in Black,"" wherein Ashlee does Courtney Love, wailing in lieu of hitting notes. ""Nobody's really seen my million subtleties,"" she says on the title track. This album doesn't change that."
1,koo-koo-ca-choo,"Where do people come up with this garbage?It is so obvious she's about as real an artist as her sister (rich & dumb Jessica Simpson-Lachey). The music is so vapid, phoney and devoid of any real content; the lyrics remind me of love notes scribbled on the back of a trapper keeper. I enjoy great, entertaining music like the next person - but this stuff just insults the intelligence.Come on now? Why can't people get behind real artists, people with actual talent and interesting things to say? Not talking depth, but just plain reality? It's disheartening, one, that this is the kind of stuff the industry seems to always get behind - cash cow potential; but on the other hand, people buy up this rubbish? This seems to be one of the hoofprints of our culture: toss anything into the troth and we eat it up. Maybe it really doesn't matter in the end. Life is short, so who cares?Yeah, who cares: buy more, buy now.www.hopeinamerica.com"
1,Please don't buy this,"First off, I didn't buy the album, my roommate did. The only reason this album was created was because Ashlee is Jessica's sister. I'm sorry to the fans out there, but Ashlee can't sing. She got a record deal because of MTV and her last name, and those record companies were smart because guess what? People don't know what ""music"" is anymore, and they'll buy anything they hear on the radio or advertisements. For those who gave this 4-5 stars, please listen to the album again and try telling me that any random 18-year old girl can't sing the same lyrics and probably sing much better."
1,the definition of lack of talent,if you look up no talent in the webster dictionary you will see a nice picture of ashlee simpson.
1,"If you buy this album, you're only encouraging her!","Ashlee is your typical dime-store pop star and this album is hyper-produced. I sadly bought this trash on a whim because it was on sale. The tracks all sound alike. Ashlee is clearly trying to copy sound of Courtney Love from Hole. Sadly, she has no talent which shows through the album. The worst part is the tunes are catchy, so you embarass yourself at work or school singing them.We had to endure her struggling to sing each track on this album, in three-second clips at a time, on her MTV show. Then we had watch her get caught lip-syncing on Saturday Night Live because of, according to her, acid reflux! Then she got what was coming when she got booed following her unbelievably bad performance.DON'T MAKE YOURSELF ENDURE ANY MORE OF HER WAILING AND DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"
1,none,"I hope all you idiots out there who buy this crap realize that everytime you purchase this ""musician's"" album, your contributing to the expensive cloths and cars that she doesnt need, but has it anyway to add to the driving force bad musicians have to make everyone around them feel inferiorjust thought a reality check would enlighten you"
2,How can you see her in concert?,"After this SNL fiasco, how are any of her fans going to be able to see her in concert when they know her voice is manipulated? I would don't pay 100 dollars to see her on concert. I'll just listen to her whining onthe cd"
1,"Can't Sing, Can't Dance.","This artist and her singing reminds me of the stunts that people have played with paintings. You know, they get a 4 year old to dip their hands in some colorful paint and then slap it on some canvas. Then they take the painting to some top art gallery and watch as a load of no talent, more money than sense, people critic it and praise the wonderful flowing streams of deepening shades of blue sky... and it promptly sells for $10,000 dollars.I am convinced that the recording companies have done the same thing with Ashlee Simpson. They have pushed forward someone with no obvious talent and are sat back laughing as people actually buy this rubbish. She was obviously embarrassed into singing live after the SNL stunt and we all saw the result of that.. how can people purchase an album from someone who obviously can not sing live.. ?"
4,Ashlee Simpson,"Ashlee's album is breathtaking. When I heard of Ashlee Simpson, I stereotyped her to be just like her sister. But then I heard ""Pieces of Me"" on the radio! It blew me away. I bought the CD the day it came out and realized Ashlee proved me wrong and posesses some talent up her sleeve. The lyrics on ""Autobiography"" are amazing and original. You can tell they're coming from Ashlee's heart and she sings them with an awesome attitude and an incredibly original voice. Some of the music on her CD makes you stop and think and realize you relate to it but then other tracks like ""Lala"" make you want to roll the windows down and blast it. Go buy it! It's totally worth it and it's a guaranteed satisfaction."
5,Awesome!,Ashlee's such a great young talent! You've definately gotta give the whole CD a listen before you jump to any conclusions about what kind of artist she is. There's a song for every mood and every taste!!~~ www.ashleesimpsonmusic.com ~~
1,When's she gonna put the mic down?,"I'm sure thats what we're all thinking .. Oh thats right, when she's on mic, its actually a recording.. My bad.. But i deffinately think she isnt that great of a singer anyways.. actually she's far from great.. Her annoying creeky voice gets burrowed into your head and OMG you'll cry.. im serious..anyways.. bit waste of money, all these songs blow.. if you want a better pop singer, i totally suggest Avril.. she's way better trust me!.. yup well im trusting you to TAKE MY ADVICE! ha.. Buh Bye!"
1,Pathetic,"This album sucks, only 2 songs are ok, this girl cant sing and she suxx completely.. retire ashlee u r worthless"
3,Could be better,"When I first got this Cd, I thought that it was great. I too was sucked into the MTV trap by watching her show. Well I like her song Pieces of Me and Shadow but after her stunt on SNL, I kinda lost repsect for her. When you are a singer performing on live tv, you should sing live. I know she said that she had acid reflux disease,but that doesn't mean she should lip sync. Don't get me wrong, I still like Ashlee Simpson, but I'm just saying that she should admit that she lip syncs and not blane her band. I think her cd could have been better, but I guess it will with the next one. If you want to see a real live performer go see Kelly Clarkson in concert, she is amazing. I suggest you pick up her cds Thankful and her new one Breakaway then watch her live in concert. She will show you how performing live was meant to be!"
3,Good debut!!!!,"I had no intentions of buying this cd but I got caught up in watching Ashlee's reality show since it followed Newlyweds. The songs I heard were good and I was always humming Pieces of Me. I got the cd and was surprised that I really liked all the songs. LaLa is my favorite, follwed by Pieces of Me, Autobiography, Love Me or Leave Me, and Nothing New. This was a good debut and hopefully she will continue in this style of music it suits her vocal ability."
4,I've never seen Ashlee's MTV show...,"Interesting that most of the reviews here make some reference (mostly disparaging) to Ashlee's reality show on MTV. In my view, this lends an element of bias to the reviews, since most people who have seen the show have probably already formed a view of Ashlee (positive or otherwise).For impartial reviews, have a look at Amazon.co.uk, where the writers have, for the most part, never seen Ashlee on MTV, and many had never heard of her before this album was released. Like me, most people found this to be an engaging and enjoyable pop/rock debut. The fact that Ashlee is ""manufactured"", and that her voice may not be exceptional, is largely irrelevant. Why? Because you wouldn't know this if you just listened to the CD on it's own merits."
5,Autobiography is Awesome!,"I went out and bought Ashlee's new cd the day it came out. And I'll tell you what...I have never been so impressed. You can hear in her voice that she is really dedicated to her music. And that makes the whole cd that much better. Not to mention, there are some really awesome songs that just make you want to dance."
3,not a bad debut but nothing special...,"i bought this used after the SNL thing which i'm over. it was almost a year ago so people should let it go. i wasn't completely satisfied but for the most part, it wasn't half bad.1 - Autobiography 10/10 good, fast, mainly happy start2 - Pieces Of Me 10/10 i'll always love this first single3 - Shadow 6/10 the whole ""living in jessica's shadow"" is crap4 - Lala 9/10 annoying chorus but still great5 - Love Makes The World Go Round 7/10 stop the cheesy lyrics!6 - Better Off 9/10 pretty catchy7 - Love Me For Me - 10/10 my favorite, very edgy8 - Surrender 10/10 great but very pop sounding9 - Unreachable 5/10 This song is unable to reach me10 - Nothing New 8/10 not a bad listen11 - Giving It All Away 5/10 spare me this crap12 - Undiscovered 10/10 amazing! perfect ending with a great melody and lyricsNot the best cd, not the worst. You could live without it. I say either buy it used or burn someone else's copy.3/5 stars"
2,its ok,it is an ok cd but i wouldn t buy it.who wants to buy the cd of a phony?i heard her liveand she sucks.she lip sings anyways
3,Stepping out of her sisters Shadow,"Ashlee Simpson has finally proved she can step out of her sisters shadow. ""Autobiography"" is a much different style of music than her sister belts out. She is trying to make a name ofr herself, which is respectable.The downside is that she does not have a very good voice. She needs to work on her vocals. After watching her show, I can only imagine what touch ups they had to do to her voice on the CD. I know for much of the show she had throat problems, which could have caused her to sound bad, but I'm sure with our without the throat problems, she still wouldn't be very good.However, I respect her for writing all her own songs. She gets a thumbs up for that. And her songs are written very well. They surprisingly hold depth, something I wouldn't imagine by looking at her. She has already done better than Jessica, but I think if she can work on her voice, she can do much more."
1,Just complete C***!,"This album is the perfect example of how the Recording Industry would slam garbage in our CD players and fill our airwaves with trash and expect us to put down $30! This ""artist"" has no buisness being touted as a singer. The songs are boring and typical pop junk. I feel sorry for her band. I am tired of cut and paste music. If you like this you must be very small minded indeed. Get her out now. This is nepotisim in it's highest form. I would give it no stars if I could. How does a person like this get a gig like The Orange Bowl. It is completly beyond me.It is time for people to hear of IQ, Arena, Riverside and Proto-Kaw. Bring back music to music."
3,Different than expected,"I had seen ashlee's mtv show and their clips of surrender were different than the actual song came out. The same with her song in the opening credits, autobiography, had a clip that was misleading to the actual beginning and none chorus interludes of the song. Also the song fly away (something like that) is not on the CD, the song she tried to record after she got locked out of her car. And the chorus they show her taping"
1,UH-oh,I think that everyone that gave this album good ratings should watch mtv sometime and watch her show where she tries to sing but cant do it and her daddy gets angry. Its just a big joke. If ashley simpson doesnt have her computerized voice changer with her then shes crap!! Shes just trying to be like her sister. AINT GONNA HAPPEN.
1,Complete Record Company Corporate BS(or CRCCBS),"If you have not figured this out yet, let me do it for you.This is a record company trying to recoup the costs, for a complete lack of judgement, they should have pulled the plug on this turd before it ever made it out. These reviews are fake, and I can promise you there is nothing Punk or Rock about this CD. In fact, it goes against everything Punk and Rock stand for.The record company put a bunch of interns on computers and told them to write this stink, and the sad part is, all of those employees and interns actually did it, and in turn, sold their own souls to be a part of this machine.Please don't fuel an already completely screwed up industry, by buying this crap, this is the biggest widget you have ever seen, and I promise you this CD will be over by the time you read this reviewLet the truth be told!"
1,"I am sorry, but I CANNOT stand Ashlee Simpson!!","I just do not like her voice and her style, I mean Jessica Simpson is alot better that Ashlee! I saw Jessica Simpson in concert and she blew away Ashlee's concerts on the The Ashlee Simpson Show! I bought Ashlee's cd and I just do not like it!!"
3,sajhfkhsfhksjaf,"You can say whatever you want to say about this c.d. Like it, love it, dislike it, hate it, whatever. BUT PLEASE DON'T PUT THE WORD ""ROCK"" AS PART OF THE DESCRIPTION OF THIS C.D.. IT'S FARRRRRRR FROM IT, EVEN FURTHER THAN AVRIL LAVIGNE'S C.D.. GEEZ...."
1,Mandy Moore rules,"Ashlee's voice is beyond horrible, but we overlook that because the melodies hatched up by the producers are so good. But that isn't acceptable. Music is more than melodies and production. Music is about heart and passion, neither of which Ashlee has. Yes, I like a few songs and find this album to be pretty good. But ""pretty good"" doesn't sell 300,000 copies and hit #1. No, MTV does that.Stop eating whatever MTV feeds you and start to discover music for yourselves. There's a lot of undiscovered beauty out there that unfortunately takes a back seat to this MTV-concocted garbage. Mandy Moore is more rock than Ashlee can ever wish to be."
1,Two Thumbs Down,"I strongly disagree with Tammy La Gorce(Amazon's reviewer of this album). Ashlee Simpson's attempt at a deep and meaningful album provides us with little more than a young woman with dreams of being an idolized singer, yet merely seconds into the first track it is painfully clear, that a singer she is not. Unfortunately for Ashlee one must first possess the pipes (naturally) to be considered a true, talented artist. She simply does not have that, in other words she is missing the first and most essential element in her fruitless quest to national stardom. I will not waste time in explaining why each and every song on this album lacks any gripping power whatsoever, but i will tell you that i did indeed (and it was painful) listen to every track in order to assess my review accurately and fairly. Im sorry Tammy you may be anxiously awaiting a sequel, I however am praying their will never be one."
1,Another reason to hate US pop culture,this is proof how MTV and Clear Channel can make your career without actually having any real talent behind it.An awful singer AshLEE simpson is here riding the coatails of her sister Jessica who is a mediocre singer.Sa
1,Sorry Ashlee but your cd isnt very good.....,"This cd is pretty bad. Bought it at tower yesterday popped it in my car on the way home and by the time we got home me and my 3 girlfriends thought it was really really bad. The music itself is ok, nothing special. Her singing isnt very good and I cant related to her at all. Im a 16 year old and after watching her tv show and listening to her music, me and my friends cant find any way we can relate to a girl like her. How can a girl with her lifestyle try to write songs about my regular life? she cant! I prefer listening to Avril Lavigne who has much more to say about my life that Ashlee Simpson ever will. Sorry Ashlee, god bless you but your music sucks!"
1,This album totally sucks!,"Saw you on MTV and bought this on sunday.your singing really really sucks!your songwriting sucks even worse!tracks # 2,3,5,7 were absolutely pitiful!!!I totally do NOT RECOMMEND this album!1 out of 5 stars"
1,UBER GARBAGE!,"Gave your cd a try and forked out the money online to buy this. Since then ive listened to 3 times and it completely sucks! I WANT MY MONEY BACK! I was misled by all the positive feedback you have on amazon, after reading them again it turns out they are all fake just like your album! Not trying to be rude but you really cant sing and your lyrics say nothing about my life! get a new job!"
1,For God Sakes,"What is music coming to? I seriously think my intelligence has been lowered just from hearing this on the radio. This girl has one of the most dreadful voices I have ever heard. You know there are REAL MUSICIANS out there who dont gain a fifth of the attention and respect this chick does. Ones who write their own songs and dont use machines to make themselves sound good (even though even with machines Ashlee Simpson sounds horrible). Really, if it wasnt for her amazingly hot sister nobody would care about this girl. Dont buy this album, please dont give the Simpson family more money."
1,No Talent,This mass marketed junk somehow sells instead of real artists that compose their own work instead of letting producers do it for them. She and her Bush loving sister both suck.
1,Worth less then the plastic used to make it,"If you would like to support the current trend in pop music of insincere, no-talent hacks who capitalize on society's tendency to buy into image versus genuine ability, then by all means buy this worthless cd. You deserve every shallow lyric, and every studio-generated vocal on this. Wesley Willis has more talent than most of these pop clowns, and he was an obese shizophrenic who heard voices in his head and sung to the backdrop of the demo songs on a $40 keyboard. I hope it is clear from Ashlee's less than stellar performance on RMA tonight that her artistic talent is zero, and that ""artists"" like her should be thankful there are enough morons out there to buy into the charade to make them rich. Personally, I will continue to listen to music that isn't contrived and send my dollars to people who deserve them."
1,What happened to real music?,"[...]what so ever. Her voice is awful and she doesn't play any other instrument, or write her own songs. I don't see how she could sell over a million copies. Don't buy this cd. Save your money for Velvet revolver, Kelly Clarkson or Eminem. Not on this"
1,She must feel stupid..,"This CD sucks...i mean seriously...i like ashlee as a person, but she needs to stay in Jessica's shadow...so she needs to shut up and take the hint that only 2 year olds and deaf people like her music. She'll go away soon or later. But i wouldnt but this album if my life depended on it..and i only hear little bits of each song..so sad...Geffen must feel retarded for signing her...JESSICA HAS ALL THE TALENT!!"
4,Ashlee Simpson-Autobiography...Not Too Shabby!,"Recently the public has been subject to heavily played rock/pop female artists such as Michelle Branch and Avril Lavigne. While at first glance, Ashlee Simpson may seem like the rest, her album sound is somewhat different. Of course, she has the regular pop sound with: ""Pieces of Me"" and ""Better Off"" (which is an excellent track, by the way), she also shows a little deeper side with: ""Undiscovered"" and ""Giving It All Away."" All-in-all this album is great! However, ""LaLa"" is a little forced, but you may find it hard to get out of your head!A good effort!"
1,Too bad it wasn't at the Super Bowl,"I think its pretty much safe to say that this is the end of Ashlee Simpsons music career, i can't imagine there being a sophmore album to this disaster, especially with Ashlee consistentley f*cking up on live TV, see: SNL, Orange Bowl. Its only too bad that orange bowl performance couldn't have been saved for halftime at the biggest one of them all and since it wasn't, we probably CAN expect another album <shudders>, seriously folks, save your money and go buy a Stone Temple Pilots or Mother Love Bone record instead."
1,Craptastic!,"Shame on those of you who pay money for this tripe and allow for shallow, talentless drones to continue to make a living in entertainment while true artists starve. Ashlee Simspson doesn't deserve any of what she has. She needs to be blackballed for the trickery and fraud she is guilty of. She must be removed from radio and television. She is so hated now that she even had to shut down the message board on her own website. Should she play a town near you, please loudly protest outside and do your part to shut her down."
2,"Once again, what downloading is for!!","First off, let me just state this: I don't dislike this CD because she's Jessica's sister. And I couldn't care less about that SNL incident! I don't like this album too much because other than tracks 1-4 and 10, it's nothing but filler! Pure and mindless filler! There's no creativity or any remote hint of originality! I'm getting so sick and tired of albums like this! The whole album is pretty much teen-movie-friendly pop-rock. If you want to hear this music that bad, just pop in any teen movie released since 1999!!"
1,a disgrace,"I think it is completely pathetic that someone like ashlee simpson has a ""music career"" She has no musical talent, yet she is making millions of dollars in this industry. The actual ""music"" is extremely mediocre, and the lyrics are laughable. She is getting paid to whine and complain about her life and her boyfriend? Go live in Africa, or even Iraq for a year, and then come and then you can complain.""Ashlee Simpson... the apocalypse must be nearing"""
1,"Pass the barf bag, please.","Why hasn't this b**** been exiled from the music industry or any other media? Horrible, absolutely f***ing horrible. Milli Vanilli was given their notice to leave and did so. Ashley ""I can because my sister is Jessica"" Simpson should never show her ugly face in public ever again. SHAME ON YOU! Teenage girls can listen to this garbage - when they get older and mature and have some intelligence, then they'll be as embarassed as the people who bought New Kids on the Block back in the day. Anybody else listening to this garbage and buying her ""music"" - you probably enjoy the bland and ""cleansing of America"" period happening right now. Give it a couple years and some REAL talent and original musicians will emerge and this stupid b**** will be long gone and forgotten with the likes of Clay Aiken and the elder Simpson herself. Nausea - pass me the f****** barf bag."
1,Im laughing my ass off,"When I heard this album I didnt know if I should laugh or I should cry. And I decided to laugh, coz I mean shes rock isnt she??? And her album has very deep lyrics. ""U make me wanna lala"" is very deep isnt it. It makes u think coz u have to guess what does lala mean. Geniuns.And there are actually people who tried to convince me that Ashlee is a ROCK chick, that her album is great, that she writes deep lyrics which can help you through the life and that she CAN sing. Common Im not an idiot.And all I can say about that is: IM STILL LAUGHING."
1,My advice.,If shes as dumb as her sister then her mouth is only good for one thing and it isnt singing. Id like to find out anyway. LISTEN TO SOME REAL MUSIC PEOPLE. Inflames all the way.
1,Should be taken out of the industry,"Ashlee Simpson should be pushed off the shelves, she doesn't deserve the chance to have a CD out when it's so obvious her voice is manipulated : She simply can't sing. And the fact that she's blamed her band for the SNL fiasco, and even forced the drummer who actually did a good job trying to save the gig (check out her website to see the apology that is obviously manipulated), I say she doesn't even deserve to have a band.The songs in this record simply all sound as make-believe ""made in studio"", it's amazing people could actually keep on buying her records, I know I did, and it's the last one I ever buy from her."
1,"not a kid, but...","Im not going to waste any time telling everyone what they already know, that Ashlee Simpson is just the powers that be duping the masses. I just wanted anyone who reads this to check out an excellent band(w/female vocals) named Scarling, please spend your money wisely....."
3,I like the songs but not her voice!!!!!!!!!!,"The songs sound good, but her voice is horrible when she sings live. Sure, it sounds fine in the studio but I could'nt believe what I was hearing when I heard her sing live. The only reason she got into this music business is because of her sister Jessica. Other than that there's no way she could be a singer. And she's trying to be so different from her sister. Jess as blond hair and she dyed her hair black. Jess does pop and she does more rock. All I'm saying is it's not worth your money, but if you like her go buy it."
1,Why does everyone love this?,"This is nothing special. She's just another pop singer who doesn't want to be like britney and hilary or whatever. Ashlee may be a cool person to be around, but her music annoys me and she doesn't have a very good voice. To be honest, i don't have this CD nor do i want it. I don't even like pop music. She can not sing like her sister. Ashlee can go in the garbage along with Avril and Lillix. Buy the new Kittie CD ""Until the End"", now morgan (vocalist of kittie) can SING"
1,"OUCH, Why did they have a second daughter?","If you are reading this you have to already ask yourself: why am I even dreaming of purchasing this vat of excrement.Riding in on the coat tails of the talented sister Jessica, the vacuous Ashlee Simpson claims to be a ""rocker/rebel"" and therefore again claims to have ""harder"" music. This music is about as dangerous as canned baby food and, while on the topic, about as musically inclined.Naming a song La La and classifying it as rock insults every principle of past or modern music. Lyrically challenged and talent deprived, the target consumer must be 12 year old, prepubecent girls or creepy men in trenchcoats.Once again I beg the reader to Not Buy This Album!"
1,"Predictable, Pointless Nothing","The problem with Ashlee Simpson is the problem with all other ""pop musicians"" today. They are not actually genuine artists but rather are marketing creations of large corporations, carefully crafted to appeal to mindless pre-teen girls. I'd recommend skipping her ""music"" and buying something from an artist with actual talent - someone who sells albums because of their talent and not because a public relations corporation came up with a successful marketing campaign and was able to convince the public that crappy music is actually worth buying. Try anything by Elliott Smith if you care about how the music sounds, which one would assume should be of primary importance."
1,Wow. She sucks,"She cant even sing right, shes nothing more then an MTV produced wannabe riding on her sisters ""fame"" (not too much to be proud of there either)"
1,Terrible....plain and simple,"Ok...Who gave this girl a record contract anyway?? Her voice is scratchy and her TRYING to be punk is just something to laugh at. The ONLY reason why she is considered famous is because of her sister Jessica who actually has a great voice, and that WONDERFUL performance on SNL which, i LOVED by the way! I read one review that said she only got a deal because of her looks and because of her family....ok I'm not buying into the looks...she looks like a dunk if you ask me. The songs on the CD made me laugh, she is pure bubble gum pop...not rock or ""punk"". The CD is NOT good at all"
1,even i could do it,"Wow, ashlee has the most talent ever. First of all, she's only famous because of her sister. She's just another girl on the planet who's sister just happen to be a star(she is living proof that you can go to school and learn virtually nothing) Ashlee a.k.a lipsycker decied she wanted to let everyone know that she is not a dumb as her sister and had a tantrum untill the music business said she could be famous too. Well, now that we know who who are, go away. I could care less if i see a 'piece' of you again."
1,I would give it 0 stars if I could!,"Yeah, at first, I though that this was gonna be a great album. Most of the songs are stupid. They have dumb lyrics, and her voice is very bad. Everyone knows, that she is only famous because of her sister Jessica Simpson. Now Jessica knows how sing! Ashlee Simpson sucks, literally! When she sang at the Orange Bowl, she was wearing this black cocatoo feather thing on her ass. She was really singing, but she was so bad, she got booed off the stage! I was like, well she sure deserves it! I watched the Ashlee Simpson show, and it was about her SNL deal, where she was caught lip-singing. She said that her voice was so raspy that she wasn't able to sing. Her voice was fine!!!!!!!! She didn't sound like she was sick or her throat hurt! She was screaming before she went on!!! Just goes to show you, that this is a total and complete FAKE! People, don't buy this CD and waste your money. REALLY!"
1,ASHLEE SIMPSON HA HA HA HA!!! ON A MONDAY ON A TUESDAY...WHAT THA FU*K IS SHE TALKING ABOUT?...ha ha,"IM GLAD I DONT HAVE THA TASE FOR THIS PEACE OF TRASH...GIRL CANT SING HER ON MUSIC,PLUS SHE DONT KNOW THA WORDS...HOT DAMN... HA HA HA...MOVE ON,TRY SOMETHING NEW OH! I FORE GOT YOU CANT HA HA HA HA,YES I GOT JOKES...A LOT OF THEM,WHEN IT COMES TO BULL JIVE LIKE THIS!!!!"
1,I don't get it.,"Okay, can someone explain this equation to me: Ashlee Simpson+her music= punk rock??? Uh...what?!?!?!?! Okay that does not make since, at all. Ashlee is pop-rockish. She is not punk. Please don't clasify these people as punk. There isn't punk rock music anymore. It died a long time ago."
1,I hope she dies,"Awful. PEOPLE, SHE DOESN'T EVEN SING HER OWN SONGS. If you fall for this you deserve brain cancer."
2,This is bad,"I dont know anything about ashey simpson literally,i only have her album so my judgment isnt biased. I see many loyal fans commenting on either fighting out the ''haters'' or their comments are influenced by somehting other than the actual music. As a musician, I must say some of these songs really stink. Considering that she lips synch, she sucks as a singer more and its really bad for the music world. It lowers the standard for musician like the fact that everyone can lip synch but if anyone can actually sing(the rating is based on the songs alone otherwise I would give her a 1"
3,"Not Very ""Punky""","ashlee's album is pretty good. it's not OMG AWESOME but pretty good. i don't really think she's ""punk"". her album and lyrics are pretty ""teeny-boppish"". i think the cover is an awesome shot, but the songs aren't too good. the best songs on her album are ""autobiography"", ""pieces of me"", ""shadow"", and ""lala"" but are sorta corny. . . if she does make another album i'm hopin it'll be a lot more rock than pop. . ."
5,BEST CD EVER!,"This is a great cd...each song has a great beat with awesome lyrics! My favorite songs are LaLa,Surrender and Love Makes the World Go Round! I also love Ashlee and her music!"
1,WOW....YOUR VOICE IS GREAT!!!,"""AYYYYYYYYYYY! It sounds like I've been smoking for over a hundred years, and had a couple beers!""Do us all a favor and SHUTUP!"
1,Definitely not what I expected,"After listening to ""Pieces of Me"" on the radio, I thought that some of her other songs would be just as good. The album, however, is a horrible letdown. The only decent songs on it are Pieces of Me (#2) and possibly Better Off (#6). I think all the others are poorly conceived, poorly written, and poorly performed. I strongly advise you not to buy this--it is a waste of money."
1,LEAVE THE SINGING TO YOUR SISTER!!,"Where should I start? This album is absolute garbage, which is funny because much of it sounds like she grew up listening to the actual band Garbage. Her singing abilities on this album are mediocre for lack of a better word. Her song writing skills are even worse! My only advice to this girl is to quickly abandon her dreams of being a musician and leave the singing to her elder sister!"
5,The best cd this summer!,Ashlee Simpson is for sure not another Jesicca Simpson. She is coming out with her own new edge. I think it is great that is is doing her own thing. She is a great role model for all those who are the younger sibling and are trying to find themselfs. Ashlee is a truly amazing singer/songwriter and she is even a great actor and dancer. This CD really gets people to see what she is all about. This IS the best CD this summer!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Very listenable. I've had LALA in my head for a week now!!,"If you like Michelle Branch, I think you'll enjoy Ashlee's cd. It's no masterpiece by any means but it still rocks and has some very catchy tunes. I'm not about to criticize her musical or vocal ability or disability for that matter, but I still very much enjoyed her album no less. It's been a while since I have bought a cd I can listen from beginning to end. Worth the $10 I paid for it!! So what if she got the deal because of her sister, you would, too! Stop hating on the girl. I watch her show and I agree she's spolied and I think she might even be more annoying than Jessica but I still watch their shows religiously. Now, go buy her cd!!"
3,she is not a rocker but has a decent album.....,"ashlee simpson is a great poser......she literally lived in the shadow of her sister before her album came out and she is just being rebellious and going with a kind of music that her voice can handle... she IS a better singer than avril lavigne live.....this album, AUTOBIOGRAPHY, is a good pop-rock cd...she does shine in tracks like the title song, 'surrender', 'shadow', and 'nothing new'.... it shows that she is just a poser on the rise....but she is just dreadful on 'pieces of me'.to be honest the best song on the LP is 'la la'.... this is a great song you can jam in the car and bang your head too....overall she may not be the better singer in the family, but she does hold a solid poser cd though....by the way the show is better than the cd.... more entertaining...."
1,no no no no no i wish you were better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I dont really like your sister, so when i heard you were coming out with your own cd I thought well maybe this will be more my kind of music.....NOOOOOO it isnt!!!!!!!I thought this cd was gonna be alot edgier with a harder sound than your sister but it wasnt. Youre very pretty but u cant really sing and your songs dont make sense to me at all. I wish my mom would have bought me the JOJO cd instead!!!!"
1,lightweight,it's no seceret who has the Vocal skills of the family.Jessica has the Skills but didn't Hit like Ashlee. run of the mill material&songwriting through out.i feel this has novelty written all over it&Pretty much about as deep as Her sister's tv project.nothing really stands up but the right last name.but it's about Dollars&sense.
1,Overrated!,"I bought this the day it came out and exspected something different and good since ""Pieces Of Me"" is good,But I was wrong this album is just a waist of money ""Lala"" is just repetive and very annoying and ""Shadow"" is very very cheesy.This album is not good at all and is not worth to buy!"
2,eh,"In my opinion there are only 2 really good songs here, Pieces Of Me and La La - if I could I would give 5 stars to those songs, zero stars to the rest of the cd. Her lyrics are not very meaningful, and after a while you get the idea that she is singing about the same thing over and over - oh wait, she is! Her popularity is fueled by her sister's success and her over exposure on MTV. If you want to listen to a really good cd, get Avril Lavigne's Under My Skin, now that's talent."
4,"Story and writing are fun, but this edition is full of typographical errors","The poor quality of this edition is what prompts me to write a review. This edition is full of periods in the middle of sentences. There are other mistakes in it in spelling and with random commas (not just a use I don't agree with, but clearly mistakes). I was still able to enjoy the book, but the mistakes definitely detract. For a bargain-priced book it wouldn't be so annoying, but this is a full-priced paperback. It is nice to find new releases of this author. She has been recommended to me by many people whose opinions I value. I'm not fully crazy about her yet, but could see her growing on one. I just wish the book wasn't so full of mistakes!"
5,good product,"I bought these cobalt tool bits to make Oland tools for my wood lathe.This size is good for small bowls, boxes and detail work.This size is also good for medium hollowing far over the tool rest without a lot of torque and chatter.Good price and prompt shipping."
2,Pronunciations??,"1999-First Edition of The Oxford Companion to Food did NOT HAVE PRONUNCIATIONS AT ALL - a HUGE error, rendering the book useless for that much needed purpose!!Many omissions as well. Hopefully, the 2nd Edition corrected these problems, but find out before you buy.Webster's New World Dictionary of Culinary Arts, Second Edition,2001, (which I bought at the same time)is not so voluminous and detailed, but has pronunciations of all terms which may require them."
5,Everything you may possibly want to know about food,The best part is that it doesn't have recepies; the author almost boasts for keeping them out. Planning a visit to some remote country and want to know what and how they eat before you start your trip? Read the relevant entry and you are home. Many more... just buy it.
3,"Yak Yak, back at ya!","My 5 year old grand daughter loves to hear what she says repeated back to her and loved playing with my father's parrot! However, my father's talking parrot (looks identical to this one) you can say much longer phrases or sing a short song and it will repeat the whole thing. I was disappointed that the one I purchased only repeats back after saying a few words. I wish I would have known this before I bought it."
3,Not what I expected.,"I had a talking parrot years ago. It was the funniest thing I'd ever heard. Not only did it repeat what you said twice, but it repeated it faster and in a much higher pitch. This parrot just repeats your words--it's boring because it doesn't sound funny like the last one did. The wings don't flap well either. Wouldn't buy again."
2,Fun while it lasted....,"This toy was a lot of fun while it worked. Unfortunately, after 3 times, it became unresponsive. Sad...."
2,It stopped working after 2 days!,"The kids ages 2 and 4 loved this but it stopped working after 2 days of mild play. The repeat back seemed garbled and when you pushed the button the parrot sings happy birthday which was cool because it was a bday gift for my daughter. We are returning this toy, very cheaply made...I'd be interested in a better quality version."
3,fine,we can't use the battery component because is there such a thing as the long and skinny screwdriver required by this thing?
2,disappointing,"The parrot moved and flapped wings the first time, then never again. It repeats the last syllable you say, nothing else. We chuckled a couple of times. Disappointing. I returned the parrot."
2,Doesn 't work well,"Not very good quality. The Parrots voice is garbled, doesn't really seem to work properly. I bought this for my grandson but am disappointed with it. Seems to work hit and miss."
1,"Had to return, poor quality!","One of the battery compartments on the bottom wouldn't stay on, so I had to tape it to keep shut. Then, the ""talking"" mechanism for the parrot would stick most of the time, so it would repeat part of the phrase and then ""stick"". Also, you had to be REALLY close for the bird to pick up your voice at all. I put in brand new batteries, thinking that might be the problem, but it made no difference. I was really disappointed as I had purchased one of these parrots locally about 15 years ago. The quality was great -- in fact, you could put the bird down and speak something from across the room, and it would repeat. Also seems like the original allowed you to say a longer phrase -- this version only allows a few words. Overall, poor quality made this a big disappointment for me ... but once again, I am thankful for Amazon's great customer service and return policy!!"
4,Very Funny!!!!,"I bought for my son and now I'm going to give a few friends too who can not pay a real parrot, jajajaja!"
3,pete the repeat parrot,Excellent potential but you could not understand what Pete was repeating. It sounded like a bunch of noise not words.
2,disappointed,"A friend had what appeared to be this item. It was adorable, the repeat speech was understandable and sounded just like the person doing the speaking.I was thrilled to find what I thought was the same parrot on Amazon.com. When I received the Parrot, it didn't work. It didn't repeat clearly and what little it did repeat sounded tinny. I put in a new set of batteries and that didn't improve the performance.I had ordered the same item for a friend in Washington and she had the same experience with her Parrot. We both returned the Parrots and were immediately credited for the purchase, but we were sure disappointed because the original we had seen was so desirable."
2,"OK, but...","I ordered this parrot by accident. I was clicking around looking at toys for Christmas. I accidentally placed two items in my cart (this parrot being one). When I finalized the purchase and went back to review the total, I couldn't believe I had an extra parrot and an extra outfit. So I contacted both sellers to cancel the orders. The seller of the clothing responded within 6 hours and cancelled the order with no problem. The seller of the parrot decided not to respond, and then shipped me a parrot. Oh, and I got nailed for $29 in shipping. Yes, $29 for a $12 toy. It seems like a nice toy, and I'd probably give it 3.5 stars. I have to take off a little for the lack of customer service and getting taken to the cleaners on the shipping. I guess I won't be shopping online anymore when I am tired!"
2,Mouth and wings didn't work,"Ordered this for my 3 year old for Christmas. Fortunately, I decided to test drive it before wrapping it up. It's cute, just averagely made. Bright colors, the stand looks cheap but that doesn't take away from the toy. You have to unscrew the battery compartment to put in 4 AA batteries. Pete immediately started repeating whatever I said or just sounds close to him (like me attempting to move his wings). His beak and wings didn't move. Perhaps if I didn't know they're supposed to I'd have kept him but I felt moving wings would give him 5 points rating. So I'm returning him and probably getting another to complete the gifts for the kids. The audio was good and clear. Hopefully the kids will love him too (the replacement).UpdateDecided to go with a furby instead for $30 extra I get a whole funny looking pet."
2,Neat but not durable.,"I bought it for my daughter for Christmas one year. We were trying to help her talk more, and she didn't really like it. My son ended up playing with it more than her. All in all it broke pretty quickly, so not really a great toy for children under 10. Could see it being nice as a novelty for adults though."
4,Pete the Repeat Parrot,"Pete the Repeat Parrot is a fun toy, and entertainment for all ages. The handle broke the first day, but it didn't matter because he wasn't going to be hung up anyway."
2,Didn't live up to our expectations,"My two and a half year old daughter has been asking for a parrot and After reading through the positive reviews, I was fairly convinced this is the right one. But overall thus purchase turned out to be a disappointment. The toy is really loud with no volume control. The item came sort of broken. I could not make the toy sit on the stand that came with it."
4,nice,"I bought this toy for my 1 year old boy because he loves bird. However, when I received this toy my 3 years old girl enjoy more then my boy. She likes this talking bird because whatever she said it will repeat it. Thanks"
4,Pete The Parrot,"Bought this for a Secrete Santa gift for my wife. Every one laughed when she opened it and it was fun to have the Parrot repeat what she said. I love my wife but when she starts to nag a little, I tell her she sounds like a parrot, ""ah, ah, I'm hungry"", ah, lol...It was fun..."
3,"Speaker gave out, but so much fun we will try another one","This is so cute and very fun. Talk to the parrot and he flaps his wings repeats what you say (small phrase). Kids played with it all day on Christmas and the speaker gave out. New batteries didn't help. Wings got twisted, but go back in place easily. Perch is plastic and had a crack in it. Amazon was terrific in processing my return and refunding the purchase price. Amazon has great customer service. We liked it so much, I may order another one and hope that it lasts."
2,Narrator put me to sleep,"After having used the ""Getting by in French"" and ""Getting by in Spanish"" with enthusiasm, I found the ""Getting by in Italian"" version very disappointing. Both the French and Spanish versions have an uplifting musical accompaniments to splice the different sections, and both the French and Spanish versions each have two narrators/hosts/teachers who banter back and forth with each other to make the learning more fun and make the material more retainable. However, on the Italian version, there is only one narrator, and she is slow and deliberate, as if she's reading from a script and she constantly refers the listener back to the book. I could not keep my attention easily focused on the speaker because her speech was too slow. I also found the French and Spanish versions nice because I could use them in the car or while doing household chores. This was not so easy to do with the Italian version because of the narrator's constant reference to the book."
3,How this Egyptian leader changed the Middle East.,"This is a breezy and glossy review of the life of Anwar Sadat.Unfortunately, it was written prior to his murder, so there is not much critical information of this leader. At a little over 100 pages, it does not go into great detail on his life. That said, it does tell the history of Sadat from his humble peasant beginnings to the Egyptian Presidency.I mention that the book is not as critical as it could be since Sadat did engage in guerrilla (terrorist) activity against Farouk's government and the British military. Sadat was in a group that planned assassinations. So I believe the book does not give a critical view of his early life. However, the later part of the book gives us the image of Sadat going against the flow and making peace with Israel. At that point, the book ends. As we know, Sadat was himself assassinated..."
5,GOTTA GET IT AGAIN!,"We bought this cd 3 or 4 years ago when my daughter, now almost 7yrs old was younger, she just loved it. we dubbed it onto casette so we were able to listen in the car. I now have a 3 yr old son who very much wants to listen to it, but it is not in good condition and skips. So, since the tape is long lost I am here to purchase another so that my son may enjoy it as much as my daughter did.( as well as mom and dad lol)"
1,Totally not recommended!,"Doesn't this look like a nice emblem that you would put on your car? And it's marked down from $22 to not quite $11, so you think it's a quality product? IT'S NOT! It's a small, cheap piece of blue plastic with a crappy silver coating that won't last very long in any kind of weather. It has a 1/2 inch by 2 inch piece of adhesive on the back, that sure won't last long, either. This should retail for $1.25 with $1 shipping!!Awful.Waste of money."
1,Shamanic Journey Drumming,"This was not what I was expecting. Maybe I need to give it a better chance. But, frankly at this point I feel that I wasted my money. Unless, someone out there likes monotone, this one will not serve you well. Not recommended."
5,You Got To Have This One!,"If your new to Shamanic Journeying or if you have some experience with it, you will find this CD is what you are looking for!The CD has a Great Intro track to begin your journeying and a approx 1 hour long drumming section that is set to the proper rate of 150 bpm to induce Alpha and Beta States.The CD is very relaxing and of course has a call back track at the end to help you return from your journey.Now having said this, if you are a sensative, and do not believe you need a drumming CD to journey as I did...try it! You will be surprised as I was.I now us it on a regular bases to help provide me with a higher more dynamic journeying experience."
4,not bad,"This cd didn't exactly shock me into being amazed at it's greatness; however, it isn't a bad cd and it does the trick for entering into trance.it would be nice if you could set it for different length journeys though."
1,"I Say ""Don't Bother.""","I'm skimming through a lot of this book cos frankly, not much to hold my interest. I've already thought about putting it aside (on page 119 currently) or at the least, picking up another book to read between readings of this one. You'll excuse me if my head hits the table?Hugh and his wife Laura lost their only child - young Michael. He got hit by a vehicle as he was getting off the school bus. This story is a day in the life of Hugh and Laura as they struggle to make sense of it all. This story moves back and forth in time between present and past and also between Laura and Hugh.(I finished reading/skimming through the book, by the way.)"
5,The right amount of tightness...,Once you get the straps on the goggles they are very easy to adjust. Kids all ages love 'em. They comes in a variety of pretty cool colors. The Bungee Straps arrive with a bit of stiffness but once they come in contact with the water they soften right up. Worth the price. Both parents and kids find it a worth while investment.
2,bungee stap,"the picture showed a few straps. Did not fremember requesting a color, so thought the price was for all of them. Would not buy a single one for that price along with \shipping charges."
3,As advertised but a little too much wear.,I can't play the CD on my computer because of some scratch wear but the story has a happy ending. I used iTunes on another computer (with a less fussy drive) and carried the files to mine. All's well that ends well. The music is lovely which is the whole point.
4,good looks,"good looks, works well in almost a year of purchase, only recommend that the photo could see the details of the belt in order to decide either purchase"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BATTERY,"I bought two of these batteries, one in 2009 and one in 2010. But I started to use both of them in 2010 because my other OEM batteries are not working anymore. They seem to lose power very fast. DO NOT BUY THESE BATTERIES or else you will feel my pain."
4,great computer - but,"These Imacs are great, but they tend to overheat - and then crash or die on you. as for the way they function with 512 or 1 gig of memory and a minimum of 400Mhz - 500 or 600 is better the G3 will do everything you need. just run it a while and make sure it is not overheating - Apple did not put a fan in the units, you can put one under it, but does not seem to help - both of mine died in the same week, so I am thinking of buying a used one to use the hard drive and memory....the best thing about this machine is upgrading to OSX and using all the neat programs - very nice, but then that means you are paying top dollar for UNIX which is low cost or freeware, and Unix - Xenix - etc...just a thought.."
2,imac DV,This machine ought to be called the iCrash! because that's all it's done since the day I bought it.
4,Private letters home from a private,"This is a rare look at a regular guy in the Civil War. You get to read the letters of the rich and famous often enough as every letter they ever wrote was saved but here is a collection of letters from an ordinary guy. He tells about his life, battles, and how he wants the money he sends home spent. You get to know him almost too well as you feel the pain of losing him. This is well worth reading."
5,Excellent!,"This book is excellent in every way!I just read this for the second time & it spoke to me in ways it hadn't the first time.One of the best hours I've ever spent.Concise, accurate, biblical information presented in a way that anyone can understand.Packed full of scriptural proof to back up the authors claims.Whether you think this can't possibly pertain to you or not, check this book out, it will change your life!"
5,How Christians Unknowingly Talk To the Dead,"This book is one of the best books that I have ever read outside of the Bible. Every Christian or perspective Christian should read this book through at least twice. Most Christians will find, unknowingly to themselves, that they communicate with the ""dead"" unknowingly.And I agree with the author that if we Christians could grasp the one concept of how to recognize and cease communicating with the dead, as taught by Jesus and the apostles in the Bible--the entire world would sit in awe!!!"
3,Fun when it works,"The game allows you to bild your own car using LEGO pieces and then race on either individual tracks or curcuits (a series of 4 tracks one after the other with a combined score). The game is really fun and both me an my son enjoy playing it except for:*The graphics often become choppy making the game unplayable. There is a fix suggested on LEGO's website but it is not for the faint of heart. Judging by their technical support page there is a high number of compatibility issues with graphics cards.*The interface for designing cars is awkward and slow - pieces are hard to find and their size is hard to judge untill you actually try to put them in place.After playing a few races we loved it. Then after the choppy graphics problem occured for the first time, we were very frustrated with it. After a few hours of research and fixing it we like playing it again. Overall, it is lots of fun but the programming could have been better."
5,Fun Racing Game-Just Buy It!,"This is a fun racing game for, yes, kids of all ages. Our four year old can play it with my help (she steers, I work the ""pedals""). The races make her laugh, and she narrates each one as she drives (""Here comes the bridge!"" and ""Don't crash into that guy!"") She also likes making her own car and driver (again with my help).Older kids (like me) will appreciate the fact that you can just start driving, without messing with car building and tuning. Then, if you want to make a custom car, you can do it anytime.This is an ideal first driving game. Don't get it for anyone who has already mastered other driving games, because this is a starter game. Don't get it for an older kid if they would be insulted by the cartoon Lego characters.Final note: I read a positive newspaper review of Lego Racers II, then saw some negative reviews here on Amazon. So I looked at the original Lego Racers, saw nothing but positive comments, and ordered it here. It turns out that was a good decision."
5,Great FUN !!!,My 5 year old son absolutely loves this game and will spend hours on end at the computer 'mastering' it. It's hours of fun and well worth every penny!
4,Lego Racers is the best!!!,"I have the demo of this game on my computer, and it equals FUN!!!I totally recommend it. Once you play it, you can't stop!!!!!One of the racers always gets Weapons which you have to remember!!!"
5,Beginnings,"I purchased both DVD's of The French Chef. Both are equally enjoyable and bring back a different time when we didn't have ""food celebraties"" but just Julia. Still informative and interesting along with the combination of her irreverance and humor make these DVD's a must have whether the viewer enjoys cooking or not."
4,Beware: The French Chef,"The French Chef 1 and 2 are not captioned as noted in the product details which is not OK if you have as profound a hearing loss as I have.The shows are watchable pretty much without the sound, if you are fan, otherwise pass up these sets of dvd's.""The Child"" is truly entertaining. If you are a true fan, these dvd's are really worth having.One note: PBS.org lists these sets as captioned also."
4,A JC indulgence but historically reckless,"These DVDs are pure and uninterrupted Julia. No awkward introductions or montages--just JC. However, the episodes are jumbled and skip from the first episodes to later ones in the seventies---but no dates! so the only way to divine their sequence is by her clothing and hairstyle. Honestly--wouldn't it have been more effective to showcase her progression as a TV personality by revealing her episodes to us just as the public saw them?"
4,"Julia is wonderful, but the DVDs have problems","I love Julia Child, and these episodes are what I had hoped for. However, the DVDs have problems with the recipes. There are two recipes on each disc, both from ""The French Chef"" cookbook. Each is related to the subject matter in one episode, but does not appear to be the always the same recipe. The recipes have problems displaying on one of my players, a relatively new machine. (Another one is fine.) They display with no problem on my computer, but there is no provision for printing the recipes."
5,Love It!,"Thanks for the excellent delivery service, pristine condition and fair price. I am a 1st time buyer from you but won't be the last. I just received this tonight. I watched the first ""potatoe show"",... listening to it in the background as I type. I love it. I am going to next send the same DVD to my dad as an early thanksgiving gift, (which we never do gifts onthanksgiving), but this is too good not to share...I know he will enjoy this. I am going to order a few of her other episodes as well.. especially her and Jacques Pepin. If you love Julia, ...this is a must have.By the way, it's good to know that good old fashioned customer service still exists. Thank you."
4,She is a classic,"Julia Child is a classic. She started a cooking show before there was one. I was very young when this came on so only vaguely remember the shows. I learned to cook fine food from her cookbook. I liked the DVD because she is not afraid to have dead air. The show is not made as entrainment (though it is) but as enlightenment. She tells you and shows you how to prepare great food, how to find the best ingredients and do it all yourself. Bon Appétit."
4,Interesting Soundtrack,"Give My Regards To Broad Street is a laughable bad movie that's not quite sure if it's a movie or a long music video. The soundtrack is a much more interesting affair. It contains a couple new songs, but what's it interesting are the reworkings of several Beatles songs and Paul McCartney solo work. In many cases (especially on the solo songs) the reworkings surpass the originals. Most notably are ""Silly Love Songs"", ""Ballroom Dancing"", ""So Bad"" and ""The Long & Winding Road"". Some of the other songs like ""Yesterday"", ""Good Day Sunshine"" and ""Here, There & Everywhere"" are not bad, but they don't change much from the originals. ""No More Lonely Nights"" in it's slowed down version is a great song (avoid the dance version)."
3,Sounds Better But...,Generally lifeless performances of old Beatles favorites and Wings/solo stuff. Wanderlust is fantastic but the rest was disappointing.
4,Quite good !,"I think that this is a good cd. I would give it five stars except that it has more older songs than new ones, but the new are really great. PAUL MCCARTNEY IS THE GREATEST !!!!"
3,All Right,"This album is pretty good. Some remakes of older songs, a couple of decent new ones (No More Lonely Nights, Bad Boy and No Values). Not his best work, but far from his worst."
3,Nice Try-But not up to par,"Paul really disappointed here. There were some nice videos, and good press way back in 84 when this was released, but it really left a lot to be desired. We know he is capable of much better, and he has delived before and since."
3,Okay McCartney album,There are some good songs. What might fail on the screen version doesn't matter here. Most of the new versions of Beatle songs don't really work mainly because of the way Paul's voice sounds. Eleanor Rigby with the accompanying instrumental are the best of Beatle tunes. A lot of the tracks are of no interest to me though.
5,Great CD,"This is one of my favorite Paul McCartney albums.There is a good choice of songs here.His remakes of classic Beatle songs such as Yesterday,Here There and Everywhere ,Good Day Sunshine,For No One ,Eleanor Rigby,and especially this version of The Long and Winding Road were all recorded beautifully.I usually dont like songs redone (except for live versions) cause they never quite hit the spot with me.But this is an exception to the rule.Ringo Starr was playing drums on many of the tunes,and you get a few glimpses of his humor between songs.There is also some remakes of some of his post Beatle days which are all excellent.This CD contains the hit No More Lonely Nights."
4,Paul At His Creative Peak,"The movie isn't so good. It's easy to see that Paul was going for something that would attain a cult status ... but the movie actually doesn't have enough music or enough pacing to make that team (Rocky Horror Pic Show might be short of dreadful, but you can dance to it and it moves at a dizzying pace). But the star of this vehicle is the music ... and it is terrific. Paul re-imagines some of The Beatles stuff and seamlessly blends his own stuff in. I don't agree with one reviewer who called the solo efforts 'tepid'. In fact, these songs showcase Paul at his creative and melodic peak. 'So Bad' is a stand-out, as is his medly. The absolute best is the disco-fied version of 'No More Lonely Nights' that thrums through the end credits ... it evokes Paul with Wings in the 70s, but adds that oh-so-special 80s take on the music. The movie is worth watching to hear the music. But all things being equal, just buy this terrific soundtrack and make your own movie in your mind."
3,More of a pleasure than the movie,"Undistinguished but not bad Macca collection. The re-recording of the Beatle songs is harmless (surprisingly, Ringo declined to perform on those) and it offers up a few decent new tunes like the title track (and it's remix) and ""No Values"". He does a great job on the ""Tug Of War"" tracks ""Wanderlust"" and ""Ballroom Dancing"" and the ""Pipes of Peace"" track ""So Bad"". A worthwhile unembarassing CD, and certainly more enjoyable than the movie"
2,"I love Paul, but....","Only 6 tracks here that you can't find somewhere else in a better version and the only one of those that's any good is ""No More Lonely Nights"" which can be found on ""All the Best."" Unless your a Paul completess (I am), leave this one alone. The remakes of Beatles classics are particularly offensive."
2,McCartney's weakest?,"Well this spectacularly annoying effort was his weakest, until ""Run Devil Run"" anyway. There simply is nothing to really listen to here; the new songs are ok, not great, the rerecordings of the Beatles classics are abominable, and so on. And we didn't need his woefully saccharine ballad 'So Bad' back-to-back on two albums! Thankfully Paul's next album, ""Press To Play"", saw him writing with conviction again."
2,"Why, Paul? Why?","If it weren't for the three new songs on this disc, I'd probably give it ZERO stars. I mean, come on-- why did he think it would be a good idea to record new (WEAK) studio versions of Beatles' classics?? God bless Ringo for refusing to play on them. And WHY did he choose to re-record fluff like ""So Bad"" that came out just the previous year? At least there were three good new songs (FOUR counting the dance version of ""no more lonely nights""). ""No More Lonely Nights"" was his best single in years, and ""No Values"" and ""Not such a Bad Boy"" represented his most convincing rock'n'roll since late-era Wings."
1,no regards,"Paul has made some interesting works, other are not so and finally has created a few CDs really creepy. This one belongs to the last group. How come somebody recommend this work. First and foremost, there's just one song to remark ""No More Lonely Nights"". Second, most of the songs are covers (quite cheesy) of his'. Third, he had the nerve of making sloppy-cheesy covers of some Beatles' classics such as: ""Eleanor Rigby"" and ""here, there and everywhere"" that's unforgivable. However, there's just something to recommend, pass this CD by."
5,High Regards,This is a great compilation of Beatle and McCartney tunes. The movie was very enjoyable for a music lover. I bought the cassette in 1984 when it came out and this is my second CD. My son aquired my first CD.
4,"It's a soundtrack to movie of same title, see it first.","THIS ALBUM HAS SOME NEAT VERSIONS OF PREVIOUS BEATLE AND WINGS SONGS. ""WANDERLUST"" AND ""SO BAD"" ARE WORTH A PEEK. IT'S A SOUNDTRACK AND THE MOVIE IS A LITTLE HOKEY BUT P. M. FANS WILL APPRECIATE IT."
5,Airplane calendar,"Complicated airplanes for kids and parents or obsessed adults, this calendar has an airplane at the end of each month. Pre-printed, ready to cut out and fold, the skill level requires at least a 12 year old ability or the help of a parent. I actually think this would be a great idea for behavior modification strategies for something different."
2,Basically a WWE documentary,this was alright for the money but what dissapointed me most was all of the footage was of the old AWA wrestling and they had no wwe and old days wwf footage but they gave a good description of the bret hart story and owen hart. Overall this was okay if you have 8 bucks to waste
4,Not intended for WWF/E Die-hard Fans,"I'll take a very different perspective on this. I have been in the business for more than 10 years now. This type of film is the ""B"" of the A/B perspective. It is NOT from or by the WWF/WWE. Nor is it intended for those fans.It IS, however, a good look at the other end of the company. A wrestler is either happy with a company or they are not. EVERY company dumps on a few workers here and there. This is the dumped on worker's views. In all honesty; the truth of the matter is somewhere in-between this film and a few ""history of"" and ""Story of"" DVDs/VHS tapes that the WWF/E put out. It's good at the <$6 point to see and understand the other side of things.WATCH IT FOR YOUR SELF AND MAKE UP YOUR OWN MIND."
1,For stupid people only.,"Okay I'll admit I did not see this cause I don't have too. It's just another example of lying documentaries like those of Michael Moore's.Sure people will say I can't knock it cause I didn't see it, but any DVD with the headline of ""We sit down with Vince Russo, the WWE writer responsible for shaping the personas of The Rock, Stone Cold Steve Austin and others"" tells me it is not worth my time cause it is in fact a lie. Vince Russo always tries to takes credit for things he never did and when he came to WCW it was proof that he had nothing to do with the success of the WWE. It is an insult to The Rock, Steve Austin, and wrestling fans in general to say he was what shaped the personas of The Rock and Steve Austin."
4,Jury's still out on this one.,"The jury is still out on this one for me. I am new to Derma e, and overall love their products so far--my skin is very sensitive, and their products haven't caused any irritation. I have used this product for a couple of weeks and really can't tell if it's doing anything. I also bought the Derma e Hyaluronic Acid Rehydrating Serum, which I like much better than this one."
3,still waiting,I have only used this for about 2 weeks and I only ordered it bceause Dr Oz recommended hthe ingredients. Still waiting ......
3,The opinion of a male model,I am still determining this products effectiveness. I've used it only 3-4 times and for only three weeks. I hope to offer my final decision following my fifth use.
3,Different Packaging,"Product received different name than soothing moisturizing creme. Checked with Derma e - Product sent to me was the old name and packaging (Anti-Aging Pycnogenol Moisturizing Creme) I think the picture should match the product, but is seems to be okay to use."
2,Chalk is mediocre,This chalk is just so-so. My son has tried it on his chalk board and it is very faint. The colors are not bright and you have to press harder to get it to write on a traditional chalkboard. No one in the family likes this chalk.
3,"Cheap and breaks easily, but fun colors!","This is cheap quality chalk, but I couldn't find small chalk in fun colors at Wal Mart or anywhere else, so I went with this. I use them to draw on my framed chalkboard each month, and I'm able to color, shade, and write just fine with them. Although sometimes all I have left is small pieces!"
4,I love this thing!,It has helped me numerously when I didn't feel like carrying a purse around... I don't know maybe it's like any other phone clip but it has also saved my phone from damage when I have dropped it many a time.
1,Product works well for mild cases but is much cheaper at walmart,"My one star is more for the price from this seller. Go to walmart and spend about 1/3 of this price. Yikes, maybe I am missing something but this is gouging customers."
5,Works better than other products,"My son's pediatrician recommended this shampoo for my son. When it was no longer stocked in the stores, we had tried Neutrogena and Head and Shoulders, but those products didn't work as effectively as Nizoral. I was glad to see it available again, at least online. Wish it was cheaper, but this product seems to work much better."
3,nizoral results,"I have not had any problems using this shampoo (hair loss, discoloration etc.) My dandruff and itching have not completely disappeared yet, however, they have significantly decreased. I do also alternate with the apple cidar vinegar treatment 3 x week."
1,Have not found this product useful,Used this daily for a week. Did not find this product effective. At least it did nothing to help me. Maybe it will work for u. I am going back to head and shoulders shampoo and conditioner which gives short term relief at least.
2,It doesn't work as well.,"My dermatologist told me to get this for a rash I had under my armpit and I used it as directed, but it dries my skin out."
5,Helped a lot,"I got really dry scalp when I was overseas, the water was terrible. This shampoo really helped keep it all in check while I was there. It doesn't stink like the tar based shampoos, smells pretty normal."
4,just started using its working great so far,"I just found the OTC nizoral and have seen great results after the first shampoo,I have thick natural aa hair and have not had any flaking or scaling, so far so good."
3,Review of Nizoral Shampoo,It's a nice shampoo but does not keep my scalp from itching which I thought it was supposed to do.
2,to much money,I found I can get it for $9.00 $20.00 way to much money fill your pockets with someone else hard earn money.desw
5,best dandruff sampoo!,"I have a very bad skin condition in my scalp and if I do not use Nizoral it moves to my face, I have found that this product works great. One of the reasons that I had to use Amazon is that there is a supply problem right now from the factory being moved and I can not find Nizoral in any store. I looked there is none out there except Amazon."
3,Nizoral Dandruff Shampoo,"This shampoo is great! i've used it before, however it has been discontinued from my local pharmacy store. I am glad i found it here. It was recommended to me by a dermatologist."
4,Used this for my dog and it worked great!,"My dog had suffered itching for two years he is only 3, my vet insists that he is allergic.We tried all kinds of allergy solutions to no avail. My poor dog suffers terribly.Someone just mentioned yeast infection to me and I ran out and bought this product.I gave him a good long shampoo and he actually liked it. He smells so good too. I was amazed at the outcome.Normally he would me scratching himself to distraction and I would be sitting here getting all upset for him. Instead he is laying next to my leg snoozing and very happy, he has scratched only about three times since the shampooing.I was not expecting a miracle but this is close enough for me. I know I will have to shampoo him regularly but that is fine with me as long as he is happy.BTW, I bought this OTC from a local drugstore chain, for $11.49 for 4 oz."
2,Expired when delivered,"Keep in mind that this is the US version of the product and that it may be expired by the time you get it. Mine was expired on the day that I received it (09/2011). It appears that McNeil has stopped producing this product and what is being sold is old stock.The product itself is great, it is just that McNeil has apparently stopped making it and so beware that you may be purchasing very old stock."
2,Handsome but useless,"I like IKEA stores very much, but this book is useless. Nice settings, fun furniture, but it's basically a catalog. And not everything you see is still available from IKEA, so it isn't even a very reliable catalog at that."
1,They don't tell you WHICH furniture comes from IKEA,"This is a very nice design book with beautiful photographs but the author leaves out some very important information. He/She does not indicate WHICH pieces come from IKEA. Looking through the photos, I'd say the majority of the furniture does NOT come from IKEA. It was nice to look at but IKEA's in-house publication called Space magazine does a lot better job."
2,Sounds like a musical,"It was a little bit a disappointment since I expected some acustic songs you would like to listen in a bar, but instead sound of each song is made with a big orchestra. Not so much my style."
5,INCREDIBLY INTRIGUING!,"This haunting CD has had a peculiar effect - it's mesmerizing! The arrangements, utilizing full orchestra in many cases, are consistently interesting and Joni sounds mostly at home in this element. My favorite cut is the swingin' I WISH I WERE IN LOVE AGAIN - a real departure for her. She reveals herself to be an able interpreter of the old standards, and spins a fascinating musical web!"
5,High Volume Romance - Joni Style,"In one her recent interviews, Joni suggested that her new ""Both Sides Now"" CD should be played with the volume ""way up high"" to get the full emotional depth from the orchestration. How right she was. I've followed Ms. Mitchell's music since she began and have never been disappointed. This comes at an interesting time for me -- lots of personal highs and lows, love among them. It's so nice to put on this music nd just ride across the waves of her rich, newly wonderful, smoky voiced interpretations. I think ""A Case of You"" is exquisite -- I've probably played it more than any other song in the set. What a classy, classy record. Now, this is what music is about -- challenging, shaping, entertaining and soothing. This is balm for romantics."
5,Incredible,"My favorite thing to do is sit down with a cocktail and listen to the original 60's versions of Both Sides Now and Case of You, and then listen to this album, in which Joni Mitchell masterfully brings the songs full circle. The original versions of these songs feature a young, raw, bare Joni, her guitar, and her youthful, swooping, innocent, soprano-ranged voice. Now, 20+ years later, her range is basically a BASS after smoking for decades. Instead of her little folk guitar, she is backed up by the most lush orchestral arrangements imaginable. For me the lyrics are even more poignant when I hear her sing them now...she has clearly weathered a lot of life since she first recorded. This woman is my hero and I am so blown away by this album. It is my favorite, along with ""Court and Spark,"" ""Blue,"" ""Ladies of the Canyon,"" and ""Mingus."" These are THE essential JM albums for a true fan's collection."
5,....fits like a glove....,"Until now, I had never listened to any of Joni Mitchell's CDs and never wanted to. Her emphasis on singing in a high vocal range always sounded harsh and was a huge turn off. Both Sides Now is a complete reversal of her usual singing style and an absolutely stunning album. Encompassing the cycle of a love affair, each song is beautifully done, despite the initial orchestral heavy handedness of You're My Thrill. A Case of You, previously recorded on her album Blue, is by far the best song on the entire album and well worth the price of the entire CD. Mitchell's voice is ideally suited for jazz and it's a shame that she hasn't recorded more albums in this style. Let's hope she repeats the experience soon and has the same, if not more, success with a genre that fits her like a glove."
4,"Gorgeous, but a missed opportunity for Joni","This is a pretty, and extremely well-recorded album. By almost any other singer, I'd admire it greatly, listen to it once or twice, and never give it another play. With Joni, I have higher expectations. The song selection is pretty good. The arrangements by Vince Mendoza are really interesting. The singing is very good. The result, though, is kind of sterile. This recording doesn't really draw one into the emotions of the songs nearly as well as you'd expect. Frankly, as good as the songs are, I think Joni Mitchell's own compositions are the best things on here. When I had the pleasure of seeing her perform this material live, the best part of the show, by far, was the second half, when she sang a bunch of her songs that aren't on the record.Joni is currently working on a follow-up record with Mendoza which will concentrate on orchestral arrangements of her own songs. That, I expect, will be a more satisfying long-term listen."
5,"""I love this CD""","Especially ""Both Sides Now"" with the orchestra. This is a classic and something different for your music collection."
2,How could she?,"I love Joni Mitchell so I could not bring myself to give her zero stars. Yet I strongly dislike this album. What I loved about her music of the past was gone from the Both Sides Now. She is a singer and song writer so great that she did not need to over-orchestration on this cd. I thought her songs came across so much better with just her voice and an acoustic guitar. Plus most of the songs aren't even hers! If you loved songs like The Circle Game, California, and the old Both Sides Now, this is not for you."
5,Layered performance,"The first reaction I had to this CD was what that the orchestration was good but detracted from Joni's voice, then I realized it complimented Joni voice, and now I realize it adds a vital element to this album. The presentation of these classics must really be listened to over and over to discover the true versatility of the words and music. Whether listening to them while pre-occupied with something else or just closing your eyes and feeling the music these songs are really effective. The magic of the album is that these are extraordinary songs that have penetrated are souls from the voices of Ella, Frank, Dinah, and Billie yet they were sung as if they were written by Joni. These songs are so different from Joni that they really ARE Joni. A surprise that is so moving and delightful that I get excited that everytime I listen to it I will discover something else."
1,what a dissapointment,"I am a big fan of Joni Mitchell. I loved the opportunity on this CD to hear how her voice has matured over the years. But, the musical accompanyment on every song is so bad that I cannot listen anymore."
1,Save your money!,"I thought by obeying the old adage of judging a Joni Mitchell CD by the cover,I'd be pleasantly surprised and inspired as I always have been by her work. It's quite a pity though, that her work after the 80's departed from the rich organic yet ingeniously simple form that put her on top.Even more of a shame about this collection,is how her own songs take an irreparable beating with breathtakingly lethargic syncopation in 'a case of you' and struggling throaty groans in 'both sides now'.This CD is nothing more than the dissapointing epitome of an airy, overpowering and quite frankly, immensely boring, milksop of a once great artist's flirt with an incompatible genre."
4,"Big sounds, classic songs","Both Sides Now is Joni Mitchell's take on ""the great American songbook,"" a task taken on by many pop singers. Mitchell tosses in two of her own compositions (both of which are indeed great) and turns over arranging duties to Vince Mendoza, who conducts the London Symphony Orchestra. The results are pretty pleasing, but not consistently wonderful. Highlights are Comes Love, with a big-band arrangement and Both Sides Now, sung now with a mature, somewhat world-weary point of view. If you like Joni Mitchell's vocal gymnastics from earlier years, you won't find that here--the voice now is deeper and thinner, with, frankly, considerable damage resulting probably from smoking. But there's still a lot of beauty in that legendary voice (another highlight: You've Changed) and it's now well-suited for jazz."
5,"A lovely, well-executed collection","With BOTH SIDES NOW, Mitchell further solidifies her reputation as an artist who never repeats herself but continues a restless quest, a hejira, if you will, for new ways of expressing herself.According to the liner notes, Mitchell and her co-producer Larry Klein planned this album as a suite of songs detaling a love affair in all its manifestations, from infatuation, to involvement, to passion, to disentegration. The plan is beautifully executed. This is Mitchell's lushest collection to date and by far her best use of orchestration so far (unlike, say, the unfortunate but well-intended ""Paprika Plains"" on DON JUAN'S RECKLESS DAUGHTER).While Mitchell does memorable and laudable renditions of others' standards, perhaps the most poignant and affecting cut on the album is her own revisitation of ""Both Sides Now,"" a sweeping, sad, sweet summation of her experiences and losses. it could surely serve as her anthem."
5,Want look back your history? This Music will be with you.,"I've read magazine that this album is 'very jazzy'. So, I was a little embarrassed this big orchestra.(Where is Wayne Shorter? ) But that's completely OK. What made me satisfied is the smell of graceful history (with dignity). The sense old but good musics succeeded to young generation. The best one I love is 'A Case of You.' I'd like to find original album and listen to it some day. Instrospective lyrics like 'You're in my bloodlike holy wine / And you taste so bitter and you taste so sweet / I could drink a case of you ...' really remains in my mind. Yes, everything has its own 'both side'."
5,BOTH SIDES OF JONI,"JONI MITCHELL has always been one of my favorite female vocalists. This recording, while surprising in vocal style, only confirms her amazing ability to stretch her range of interpretation.Tracks such as ""You're My Thrill"", ""Comes Love"" and ""You've Changed"" evoke the smokey memory of Billie Holiday and singers of the genre. ""A Case Of You"" speaks with a nod to her youth and a knowing heart. This recording confirms Joni's status as a true artist who knows HOW a song should be sung. How amazing that she has the venture of her early days blended so seamlessly with her voice of experience."
4,"Great, but not exceptional","THis is a great recording, but it is not exceptional. But I think Joni is going to the right direction with this mellow jazz style. Traditional Joni fans might be dissapointed, but I am not, as I welcome her latest recording since I am an avid lover of jazz. Would give it five, but it loses a bit of steam towards the end."
3,Almost made it.........,"I purchased this CD what it first came out. But play after play something is always awry. The musicianship is first rate, it had to be with Mitchell, Erskine and company. But the BASS is too TUBBY or BOOMY and this makes listening to the selections very irritating and fatiguing. Mister engineer-man, the music is supposed to relax you but instead one is always jolted when the artificial bass sound comes out - rap city?With due respect, Ms. Mitchell you did very well belting out your emotions, I gave your performance 5 stars. Perhaps your producer should sue your recording engineer or your bass player or both and for that, the overall rating dims to 3 stars."
1,Disappointing,"What a disappointment! I'm a long time fan of Joni's and this is probably her worst release, ever. Can I trade this CD with someone?"
4,Times of our lives,As you get older and have life experiences the lyrics take on different meanings. Fun to think about
4,Good Disc,I've followed Joni Mitchell's career for a Long long time and she is constantly doing her own thing and this Recording is no different.I Enjoy her voice&the Music here.but I feel her more on her stuff overall.A Case of You sounds Fantastic.She is one of the very very few Mavricks left in the music Business.getting a Recording of her's is still a treat.you are getting A real Music Talent&Genius.
4,"No hit, no miss","Borrowed Time is the fourth Robert Goddard mystery novel Ihave read. Once again, the author brings us a crafty tale of murder, deception and lies. There are enough twists in thestory to keep us guessing - and reading - of what really happened, who is speaking truth, who now is the true culprit. Sadly, the manner of how we come to know the truthis rather unsatisfying in relation to Mr. Goddard's previous works I've read. The principal character does not come to the ultimate conclusion by way of his own investigative reasoning. The underlying motive of the criminal act - how true and realistic this motive may be - is rather plain . It leaves me hungry, unfulfilled and certainly does not grab me by the throat. This book however still deserves a good rating for the author created a fine intrigue, good twists in the plot and a realistic view of family-life in hard, harsh times. More of Mr. Goddard's work is on my reading-list."
2,no difference,"I see no difference with this cable compared to the original Xbox cable, but I am probably doing something wrong."
4,Excellent computer for home,"This is an excellent computer for home, it provides all the things needed for any home task, it is also great for digital video an image management. The only thing it makes me not give it a five star rate is that is not to expandable, any way, if you are not planing to add more hard disck drives and there is no problem to add any other stuff as external peripherals, this is a great product."
4,yesterdays model,"I have had this little machine for about 5 months now and Its workin great. The simplicity of the OS is wonderful! It literally took me less than 5 minutes to get connected and on the internet. While OSX is very, very stable It leaves me wanting the speed of 9. The programs I use this computer for are photoshop7, indesign2, and illustrator10. A G3 isnt exactly the best computer to be running for these programs. A new g4 imac is what I really wanted but my financial problems kept me from purchasing one. If you have the money and you will be doing animation, photo rendering, etc. then there is no doubt that you want a new g4. Check out the new emac, it's looking very nice and is the most affordable g4 on the market. (at the moment) But you should really find out what computer is best for your needs and what you can afford. Read alot of reviews and ask alot of questions, because buying a computer shouldn't be a trial and error situation. Know what you're buying!"
2,Top Checkbook Royal Calculator,This Royal Calculator was a bad purchase. It worked for about a month and went blank. I hadn't dropped or misused the calculator it just died. It still looks like it's brand new sitting in my kitchen draw.
3,Won't stay put,"Love the calculator. However, it wass held into place by some sort of sticky substance which is still sticky but does not hold onto the calculator. This allows you to easily drop it when opening checkbook."
1,CHEAP LOOKING,NOT VERY GOOD QUALITY cheap looking item is over priced would not recommend I would keep looking & pass on this one
4,Nice...but...,"Ok, for the price, this can't be beat for a small office. However, some caveats. First, it is pretty noisy, not ""I can't hear myself think"" kind of noisy, but if it sits next to someone all day and gets heavily used, they will find it annoying. Second, our printers power supply shut down a week ago (about 4-5 weeks after we purchased it) and we are hoping to see a technician with a replacement part today. So we have been without the use of this printer for a week. Luckily we had a couple little inkjets scattered throughout the office that allowed us to get by.Finally, be careful when you order, because this item did not include the 250 sheet paper tray. I caught this just as I was about to order and added the paper tray for another $100 or so. Pretty stupid to sell it without it (considering that it is intended for an office environment), but that is how it is marketed."
1,NOT a good machine,"We have five people in our office, all run Windows XP, one runs a Vista machine too. On average, once every two weeks we have to reload the software on our PCs to make the Scan To function work. Occasionally we lose the ability to print, and have to reload the software for that too. It might work okay in a small office with peer-to-peer networking, but in our corporate branch office it does not work well. I'm about ready to buy my own scanner out-of-pocket so I won't have to waste my time on this machine.It is noisy. The color and black cartridges are installed in a carousel. When you print a document with color, the carousel rotates for each cartridges, making a clunking noise. I'm glad it's down the hall a bit. Ours also does not duplex (scan/print both sides), a huge waste of paper and space for printed material, and wasted time for scanning two-sided documents."
2,Drivers needed,"I bought this unit over two years ago (2006) and was very disappointed when HP took until March 2008 to come up with their first (and so far only) driver for Leopard (OS X 10.5). Even now some parts are missing like software for the envelope-printing widget. I tried calling HP Support, but they could not do anything for me. For $1000 (the price I paid two years ago) I expect better.Also, the is constantly calibrating itself, adding to the noise already mentioned in the other reviews.PS on March 16, 2011: Still no driver for Snow Leopard! This is now a $1000 brick, good only for printing (but not envelopes) and one-page-at-a-time copying.I plan to sell it and never buy HP anything again."
2,Mac Users Avoid!!,"I don't have lots of experience with this printer, but I am trying to get it to work with a new iMac using OS 10.5.2. What a nightmare. The HP software is rubbish. I can get OS X to print using the built-in printer control, but any other operations, like scanning, are intermittent at best. That's really the worst part. One minuet, the thing works, then HP Scan crashes and everything grinds to a halt. I have embarrassed myself twice by proclaiming the printer ""fixed!"" only to have the darn thing fail again with my customer standing over my shoulder. Horrible.It's only a little better than Samsung, which simply stopped making Mac drivers for one of my older laser printers.Samsung and HP = :( mac"
1,Very very loud,"I was very dissapointed with this printer. The performance was not what I expected, I would say it was sub standard. One thing that bothered me the most about this printer was that it was really really LOUD, it woke up my sleeping baby in a different room."
