5,Augusten is great at both memoirs and novels,"I read all of Augusten Burrough's books and I loved them all. Sellevision was the last one that I read and I wasn't sure how it was going to be since he only wrote memoirs before this. This was one of the funniest and clever novels that I have ever read. Augusten is so smart and down to earth and he made the book so much fun to read. I was laughing the whole time. I will never look at home shopping networks the same way. Seriously, you will love it.But like he said in ""Magical Thinking"", you have to be a certain type of person with a certaian sense of humor to appreciate his stories. He even went so far to say that he wishes that he could have people apply to read his books so that he can only choose the people who he likes.I can't wait for ""Possible Side Effects"". I already pre-ordered my copy. I love Augusten Burroughs's books and he is definately my favorite author."
4,If you like QVC you will enjoy this and a laugh,"If you are an avid QVC fan or home shopping tv fan, this is a must. Very fast reading and a good laugh"
4,Burroughs' only work of fiction,"This is Augusten Burroughs (the phenomenal author of Running With Scissors and Dry) only novel thus far. And he handles the form rather well, though he is known for the short memoir-vignette. But he definitely has the potential to write great fiction, and I think he has run out of things to write about from his life (they get less interesting as his books go on). I will say that Sellevision is a little cliche and that at times Burroughs tries to hard. It's like his idea of his life if it were fiction. BUt definitely worth a read."
4,Funny and ironic view into the world of TV home shopping,"In this witty look inside the world of TV home shopping, Augusted Burroughs is both clever and mysterious. Not only do you get a look inside this bizarre world, but also deeply into the colorful characters who live in it.As the novel that then launched the 3-part memoir series by Augusten Burroughs, I recommend reading them all. You will laugh your head off in some schenes, yet be wide open in horror and amazement in others. I recommend them highly:Running with Scissors: A Memoir,Dry: A Memoir,Magical Thinking: True Stories. Take them all to the beach!"
2,Very disappointing,"I so loved both of his memoirs that I had high expectations for this book. Needless to say, they were not realized. I found it to be a boring, predictable piece of fluff."
3,"Love Burroughs, don't love his fiction","This is Augusten's attempt at fiction, and although it is well written. It was not as funny as his own stories. Some parts were a little boring, but this book had a lot of twists. Def a good light reading. It was very enjoyable. The book said it was in ""good"" condition, which it wasnt in terrible condition, but the cover was all bent up."
2,Would have made a better script,"I like this author, and the book has a great premise. Unfortunately, I don't think the author cared enough about them to ever bring them to life. The situations in this book are quite hilarious -- and they would work really well as a popcorn movie. It's just not a book."
3,Sellevision: A Novel,I really enjoy the author and plan to read more of his books. This was a quick and easy read and much lighter than Running with Scissors.
4,Love it....except,"i love this product! only problem we had was that the zipper fell off while we were trying to zip up our baby's toys the first day we received it. i think it might have been a faulty zipper. also, it can be a bit difficult to squeeze into a restaurant high chair. but it's simple to use on shopping carts and it covers the seat area completely which is a definite plus!"
5,Beato Soft Drum Bags,"This is the first time I have used soft bags for my drums. While not giving the same impact resistance as hard cases, with a little care these bags give a considerable amount of protection from scratches and dings and a convenient way to carry and transport your drums. If you are transporting your drums long distances or having them loaded/unloaded at gigs, by folks who are in a hurry, you might want to go with hard cases. But for local venues, with reasonable care loading or unloading, these bags are perfect. The fit is good and the construction is excellent, with the heavy nylon bands extending from the handles, completely around the drum. They also fold or collapse into a compact space for storage, something not possible with hard cases. To be able to protect, carry, and store your drums for under $50, these seem like a bargain to me."
3,Television Series,"Eileen Dewhurst's THE HOUSE THAT JACK BUILT is a murder mystery told around the background of a British television series of the same title.Sue Halliday has been a member of the cast since she was two weeks old, but as an emerging young woman she has a crush on one of the actors in the show. She keeps a fantasy journal of her faux romance. This is stolen from her purse and her nightmare begins as a staged voice on the phone blackmails her into actions she doesn't understand until real accidents start happening to members of the cast.The early part of the story told from Sue's perspective is rather flat, long and drawn out. The story gains substance when the point-of-view switches to that of Sue's real mother who has been deprived a her daughter's love by her stage mother.Okay read, but lagging in pace.Nash Black, author of SANDPRINTS OF DEATH."
1,"Broke on First Use, Image not Accurate","I used this product once to drive a 5/8"", 8-foot ground rod. The image shown with the product indicates a single shaft tapering into a flared tube. This is not how the tool is constructed. Instead it is two separate pieces, a tube and a shaft. As you drive the ground rod, the tube slides up the shaft, until the edge of the tube and the business end of the shaft are evened up. The tool is worthless at this point because it doesn't stay over the top of the rod, it just bounces around on the end of the rod you're trying to drive. Look elsewhere, this is not up to the Dewalt standard."
2,True - Photo not accurate,"I just received this ground rod driver and it is true - the shaft/hammer has a sleeve pressed on the end rather than being one piece like the photo shows. However, I figured the price was right and that I'll tack it in place before I put it to use. We'll see how long it lasts."
3,Pretty cool,"I picked this up after hearing The Calling's song ""For You"". I like The Calling a lot as it is so I figured ""Hey, if worse comes to worse, I have a CD with one of their songs on it"". This soundtrack has much more to offer than that though. ""Won't Back Down"" by Fuel is my second favorite song on the CD. It's pretty loud, good lyrics, and by a good band. Hoobastank's ""Right Before Your Eyes"" is also a good effort, not really their best song, but you know, what do you expect on a soundtrack? Beyond that, it's just OK. If you're a big rock fan, you'll probably love it, and I'd definitely reccomend you pick it up. I think this is one of the better soundtracks of the year, so even if you're not a huge rock fan, you may want to check it out. Peace."
3,Daredevil Has First Great Soundtrack of 2003,"I own a lot of soundtracks, but very few of them have more than 5 or 6 songs that I actually like. This soundtrack, is one of those few. I usually buy soundtracks just to get the new songs by the artists that I like, in this case, it was Fuel, Seether, Nickelback, Hoobastank, and Rob Zombie with Drowning Pool. None of the songs by those artists were disappointing in the least. Then there were the artists I wasn't so familiar with that caught my attention, like Evanescence and 12 Stones. Also, I've only just recently taken an interest in Chevelle, and their song on here is awesome! I think just about every song on here was at least ok. This is certainly a soundtrack worth picking up. It may also provoke you to go buy albums by some of the artists, in my case, I'll soon be purchasing the latest from Chevelle and Evanescence. Even if you didn't like the movie, give the soundtrack a try!!!"
2,Like the music but...,"You can buy the tracks on this ablum individually (from Amazon) for $5 or... you can buy ""the album"" for $10...The CD is one of my favorite movie soundtracks - the download list here is missing too much."
3,Dare Devil alright the movie seems to be much better.,"Well the movie awesome it must see that for sure. i found only few songs in the movie that where played. it was nice because they where the one i really enjoyed from the movie...I believe the best songs on this soundtrack are......Evanescence is so awesome i love both songs from this artist. Songs are, Bring me to life and My Immortal. Other songs that are so good are....Salvia, Bleed for me. Nickel Back, Learn the hard way. Finger Eleven, Sad Exchange. And of course the theme songs is great too...Daredevil Theme - (blind justice Remix) -Graeme Revell and Mike Einziger.I would also say that two of these bands have other great songs and you all should take a look at them.... Evanescence - Hello, and Lies. Saliva - Always, and After me .those are just few that i love the most. hope this helps everyone who loves music as much as i do....Hope the movie comes out soon to buy i be buying it forsure........!"
5,From the hometown of Evenescense,"This CD was even more eagerly awaited here in Little Rock, Arkansas since it's the hometown for the group Evenescense. The radio stations here have been playing ""Bring Me to Life"" for a couple of months. This entire soundtrack is one of the best I have ever heard. It has some of my favorite groups: Saliva, Seether, Nickleback, Chevelle, Fuel, Drowning Pool with Rob Zombie and more. The group Seether is coming to LR next month for the third time, believe it or not. This CD rocks and so does Little Rock."
5,Evanescence is amazing.,"Basically, I've listened to the title track, and this is a review for that song. It's...*UH*-mazing. Yes indeed. The song starts off with some good sounding background noise of a storm and enters into the strong female lead. Singing along she's acommpanied by good guitar and a good beat in general. The song is in itself, moving, the topic as well as the male singer who comes in to contrast with her in a rappish style of singing, is just...moving. It's the only word i can think of. It's amazingly new and fresh, and I love it."
3,Tequila,"Some music is like an 1830's Madeira. You savor the complexities, the harmonies, and feel smart for consuming it. It lasts forever and is something special.To paraphrase Whitley Streiber's _The Hunger_, you drink tequila because of how it makes you feel, not how it tastes. This music is not Madeira, it's tequila. Not that there's anything wrong with that. But none of these songs is really anything special, but I like listening to it while working out. It gets the blood pumping and distracts the brain."
4,A great CD!,"Along with the soundtracks to the Spider-Man trilogy and Fantastic Four, the soundtrack to Daredevil is a great CD to listen to. I bought this on eBay around the same time that I bought the Fantastic Four soundtrack. My favorite track is Won't Back Down by Fuel. I love this CD."
3,Song Titles?,What are the songs playing during...1) the funeral2) when elektra is trainingPlease help me out...thanks!
4,Evanescence,I've been waiting for this soundtrack for SO long! Ever since I saw Evanescence in concert at the beginning of January. They're from my hometown so this is WAY major for me :) Nothing cool ever comes out of Little Rock. THANKS GUYS! Bring Me To Life is such an awesome song... and I'm just so excited to hear a hometown band on the big screen!
2,Too bad Daredevil isn't deaf too,"I guess after Spider-Man was such a success in the box office and it's modern rock soundtrack was such a success too, it seems only that natural that Daredevil follows the same formula. However, Daredevil: The Album is yet another collection of ""all-star"" modern day post grunge sensitive rock that truly grates on the nerves. Funny how songs by Fuel, The Calling, Nickelback, and Hoobastank all sound like they're from the same band isn't it? Most of the soundtrack is filler, the only saving graces being the pairing of Rob Zombie with remaining members of Drowning Pool for the headbanging ""Man Without Fear"", and the two tracks from Evanescence are worth listening to, but other than that this disc is best used as a coaster."
2,Not The Greatest Soundtrack...,"To put it plainly, I didn't like this soundtrack very much. Anyone who knows me knows I'm a huge fan of guitar rock and metal. But this CD made me disappointed.I've been a fan of Fuel, Nickelback, Boysetsfire, Hoobastank, and Finger Eleven since they all started out. But, truth be told, Fuel, Hoobastank, and Evanescence have the only stand-outs on this album. All of the songs sound the same to me. Its redundant and slow.This CD reminds me of the annoying pop-ups on the internet a lot of the time. You don't want them to pop up, but they do. Much like the songs- you don't want to hear the same thing over again, but you do. I found myself rolling my eyes 20 minutes into the CD every track that came on.If you like diversity in rock, please don't buy this disc. Or buy it for someone else. I gave mine away."
3,MISSING THE MOST IMPORTANT SONG,"I am typing this review only to note specifically that the hottest song in the ENTIRE movie and one in which probably does more for Michael Clarke Duncan in this flick than most songs do for any portrayal of the villian is, LAPDANCE, by N.E.R.D.KINGPIN IS AN OUTLAW"
2,not so good,"OK so I bought this mainly for the evanescence song. Bring me to life. On the cd was another excellent (but really slower) song by the same band. 2 1/2 of my 3 stars are awarded because they really made me discover (and appreciate) this new talent.as for the other songs, well,the calling, nappy roots and moby are BAD. Fuel's song is good and autopilot off's raise your rifles was greatly surprising. well-known bands were deceiving (saliva, seether, nickelback, chevelle, hoobastank, finger eleven and 12 stones), we know they can do much better. and lesser known bands (except evanescence and autopilot off) were not so great discoveries. I had waited for this cd with great expectations, bought it as soon as I could and it deceived me a lot."
4,Speedy Daredevil Arrival!,My son had to have this CD. I ordered it and it arrived in record time! I would absolutely buy from this seller again! Thank you!
4,Daredevil,"This is a pretty good cd, with some good songs from seether, saliva, chevelle, the calling and some others. The reason i gave it four stars is because most of the songs that are good, are very catchy, but there are some very poor songs on this cd also."
2,thin on information but interesting. caveat emptor applies,"I just finished watching this. I've also read the subject's book, The Catchers of Heaven. The book was interesting but disjointed and hard to follow., the DVD is a long interview with Michael Wolf by someone who is... very simpatico with him. There are no probing questions here, no followup, no explain further. Well, what else is new in UFO stuff. heh. All of it is just too breathless by half and too coy to be much beyond frustrating. To everyone in the field I would say; be clear, no more coy, no more dancing around, just tell something useful or shut up."
5,Spot On,"People who moan about how dismal the author makes Britain look obviously aren't acquainted with the UK of the early 80's. It was a dump!! If you want someone cooing over scones or gurgling with rapture over English gardens look elsewhere. 1982 Britain was grey, dreary, and poor. The book captures the essence of Britain at the time."
1,I could not finish this,"This was a book I stopped reading when I was one-third of the way into it. It's not because I think Great Britain is a boring place to read about (quite the opposite), it's because Theroux's writing is filled with so much sneering contempt for the places he visits and the people he encounters. With a greatly inflated sense of his own intelligence, he snorts at everyone's little foibles and stupidities and sniffs disdainfully at every little town or vista he passes. It's like being stuck in the car with a conceited sourpuss for a REALLY long road trip... not worth it."
3,lovely lovely lovely,Bit samey. All that scenic scenery is something to see. I guess I don't feel I've gotten to know a place until I know how the people who live there experience it. Theroux takes a patronizing view of those few he does meet. He paints the british national character as being on a spectrum ranging between cantankerous and drab. He is also given to over intellectualizing. Many incidental details are presented as mundane reflections of Big Ideas. Stomach churning.
1,An unbelievable bore,"I first attempted to read this book ten years ago, and couldn't manage to get halfway. I fought through it this time and affirmed my belief that this is a dull book! The man spent three months or so travelling and managed to see nothing. He apparently promised himself that he would shun castles, churches, etc. but he doesn't find much worth writing about. He claims that he's interested in people and scenary, but inadequatly describes both. The only interesting thing that happens the whole time is in Wales, and he spends a full page (out of over 400!) telling us about it. I can't help thinking that if I was doing anything for three months, something would happen worth sharing. But perhaps it's because he spends so little time in each place that he learns nothing. I've been to England a few times, and enjoyed my time there. As a first time visitor, I'd toss this book out before I was discouraged."
1,A tremendously dim outlook,"Being an avid reader of travel books, I have to say that this is one of the most depressing books I've ever read. Paul Theroux does an amazing job of describing a Great Britain on the verge of depression, desolation, and decay. By his viewpoints, we should expect the country to come to a screeching halt in the very near future by virtue of its unemployment, incompetance, disrepair, and violence. I found this book so difficult to read that I did not finish it, and gave it away."
1,Rubbish,"Although Mr. Theroux had lived in England many years, he obviously knows nothing about the English. His book is like taking an interesting walk with someone you don't particularly like because he's constantly in a bad humour. It isn't until Chapter 20 that he writes anything at all positive about the country. Maybe he should try again, walking the in the opposite direction!"
2,Not good,"Generally speaking, Theroux is a great travel writer and I've enjoyed several of his books. Not this one. It's a snooze."
4,"Return journey, Mr. Theroux?","This, like nearly all of Paul Theroux's travel books, is superb. You really do get a sense of Britain, its coasts, its places and people. It's a particularly incisive portrait of the country at the time of his journey - 1982. And that's the only drawback. In ""Ghost Train to the Eastern Star,"" Theroux revisited many of the places he first wrote about in ""The Great Railway Bazaar"" decades earlier. Please, Mr. Theroux - take us on another trip around the coasts of the British Isles. We'd love to see it again through your perceptive eyes."
3,Too Tight,"While the shoe is well made and just what I am looking for, I find the Clarks Artisan shoes to run very narrow. I have a medium foot and the Artisan collection is too tight. Very painful to wear for even 15 minutes."
5,Really cute shoe and COMFORTABLE!,"I've bought a bunch of Clark's shoes from their various collections, and this is just another masterpiece.It's really adorable, looks great with black tights, and you can run around all day like you were wearing sneakers!The shoe is so well-made, the leather is just sumptuous, and the padding in the shoe is unbelievable.It's a great shoe when you want to run around and not be in pain from the wrong pump. I'd highly recommend it, and pretty much all of the Clark's line (although you do have to be careful. Some Clark's shoes fit better than others, and when they DON'T fit well...well, I don't have to describe shoe pain to any woman who has ever worn heels!)"
3,"great shoe, but not perfect","This is a great shoe, but beware that the width fits tightly for an average shoe! I had to get them stretched."
5,Simply Brilliant,"One aspect that non-Indian readers will completely fail to realise is the boldness with which Tagore used to weave his imagination based on stark solid reality. Tagore was socially ostracised for his depiction of the passion (always cloaked and shrouded in the garbs of the civilsation, norms of the society) of an honourable aristrocatic married lady, which acts as the metaphor for the passions the society was undergoing in those turbulent days of political upheaval against the British Empire. A brilliant picture of the torment of the human character caught in the web of desire of ecstacy and quest for contentment, peace and bliss, this narrative draws a beautiful parallel to the miopic frenzy of the mob in its quest for subversion with the destructive consequences of unbridled passion, and an individual's attempt to bring harmony and order in the chaos, attaining salvation. Technically brilliant, this disturbingly beautiful tale is another of Tagore's timeless creation."
1,The Passtor's Secret,this film sucks. There is no story here just someone who wanted you to hear the choir sing. A total waste of my time.
3,"a good ""read and leave at home"" book. many color pictures.","Biggest, heaviest & most expensive of the 4 books I bought, it has a LOT of pictures, but wastes quite of few of them on things that I have no interest in.. I don't care about groups of children, people in the marketplace, people in a bar, people in a restaurant, 2 men sitting in a library, etc, etc... but there are a good number of other good pictures, but not nearly enough of the BIG INCA sites... not much in the way of maps. If you're spending the money to go to Peru, buy all 4 of the books I got, but read this one at home and leave it there; take Lonely Planet for maps of cities and archeological sites. And don't use ANY book for the final word on hotels, restaurants, busses, trains, guide services, etc.. also reviewed: Lonely planet Peru, Rough Guide Peru, and Peru Handbook by Alan Murphy."
5,Get's you ready to go!,"What a wonderful country! This book like all the other Insight Guide books that I've read (Costa Rica, Morocco) gives an excellent history and overview of the country. Many people complain these books are to vague and don't cover the specific details of trip planning. I will agree with that, but I won't complain. These books are great for getting an idea of what to see and where to go, not where to sleep and eat and how much. The pictures in these books cover such a wide range of sites and topics. I recommend, buying an insight guide book for the countries flavor, and a seperate guide book or two for the trip planning details, (I prefer Lonely Planet). I have, and will continue to buy an Insight Guide book for everywhere I travel. The best thing about these books is after your trip when you look thru them again and see pictures of the places you've been, it truely takes you back. Buy this book, go to Peru and enjoy!!!"
4,A Great Guide,"I've been to Peru several times and found this guide book very informative. The maps are really good especially if you want roadmaps of the entire country. I haven't seen this in any other guide books. I'm planning a drive trip to the south central Peruvian Highlands for next July. This book will go with me. It has great photos, not just of ruins, which are great, but real people. Peru's riches do lie in its people. I think the photos let you know a bit about the cultural differences that do exist in Peru. Buy this book!"
5,An interesting life portrayed through a musical essay,"One of the most interesting of Elgar's compositions is his Enigma Variations. Most of us have heard this work played and initially wondered who these people were. There is no better ""essay"" than Sir Andrew Davis' DVD with his hypnotic lesson by word and piano followed by his rendition with the BBC Symphony Orchestra. This is a DVD that is to be played more than once just to appreciate what Andrew Davis' lesson to each of us has been. All of us will hear the same thing but each of us will see and hear in a different context. One should be so lucky as I have been to hear Davis in an orchestral rehearsal and a voice Master Class. A truly great communicator."
1,Don't Purchase,"When I received this product, one of the spinning wheels was broken. Also as we put the puzzle together it did not lay flat. Because of the moving pieces it was hard for me to get together and impossible for my 3 year old. I do not recommend this puzzle."
5,Wonderful Mallet,"For the cost, this is a great shop quality mallet. The colors are yellow and black, which makes it a nice change from the orange that swamps most shops. If you are looking for a sturdy, high quality mallet for your tool chest, this 24 ounce mallet will do well for both heavy and light jobs. It is not cheaply made in any way."
5,The Great David Calzado,"This is a great DVD for any musician who understands the hard life talented musicians have to go through to become great. Its a must see, if your interested in people who truly love music, Not for money but for the love of music,then buy this DVD. I should add David Calzado is a Russian trained classical musician.Viva Fidel"
5,Book Order,"Great service. Condition of book was okay, but that was expected from the seller's report on the condition (very accurate report) and it was delivered in a very timely manner."
2,not a well writen book,"The authors don't know how to explain the theories in a easier way, on the contrary, they try to confuse you as much as they can. They also have all sorts of stupid examples which have nothing to do with reality. They are theorists, not good writers!There are also many mistakes in the book. not too professional.If your university requires this book, you do not have a chooose, but it is not a good one."
4,Second time around...,"MARRIAGE BY NECESSITY by Marisa CarrollOctober 14, 2005Amazon rating 4/5""In Marriage by Necessity, Sarah returns to her ex-husband's hometown of Cottonwood Lake, Michigan to ask him to do her a big favor. After she and Nate split up, Sarah remarried, the result being a three-year-old son, Matthew. Sarah's husband was killed in an accident before Matthew was born, and she has been raising their son on her own. Sarah was recently told she is dying, and does not have much time left. She asks her first husband Nate to marry her again so that her son will have a father and family to take care of him when she is gone."" Complete review at BookLoons dot com - M LoftonI found this to be an interesting premise, but it took me a while to warm up to it. The characters are what made this book work. Recommended."
4,A great historical event,"A must see to understand what these poor Arjentinian soldiers went through during this island war.They were closer to this island then the british, but sure the brits were more orgenized and supplied better."
3,Good but the bosch is better,"Honestly I have had great success with a number of dewalt tools but when in comes to bits, whether its sds plus or max, bosch and hilti's are that much more better. This unit worked great until it got a full day breaking through a brick facade, it rounded the head. Go with the bosch the price is similar here on amazon."
5,A book that will reveal your inner musical soul.,"I recently had the pleasure to review Jon Gindicks book entitled Country and Blues Harmonica for the Musically Hopeless. I Have been interested in the harmonica for several years but was of the opinion that I had absolutely no musical talent. The closest I had ever been to an instremeent was about 20 feet from the piano in my high school choir class about a couple of decades ago. Jon proved me wrong. After reading his book and reviewing his harmonica video tape for beginers, I began getting the hang of it and found out that I posessed bountyful soul."
2,Not all there,"The book was fine, but it should have come with an instructional tape and a 'C' harmonica which it didn't. I have a harp, but no tape. Not a satifactory purchase. If you look at the art clip accompanying the ad for this product you'll see the tape and harmonica attached."
1,Not a real stuff!,I am using this perfume for more than 20 years and for the first time the smell was kind of weird. Ordered from another company and liked the smell!
1,Not where it should be,"If you look at the history of Vista (aka ""Longhorn""), it is no where near where it should be. Microsoft went over deadlines on multiple occasions and the features that were to be so definitive are missing. And the new features are buggy at best.Do yourself a favor and leave Windows. It's far beyond where it should be and this garbage is overpriced. I mean, c'mon. Over $300 for an operating system with subpar features, and a horrible interface? No thanks.I'm just happy my college partnered with Microsoft so I didn't have to actually pay for it (well, I did but through student fees)."
2,Vista - WOW - Nothing Works!,The weekend I got vista I loaded it...3 times. That's because every time I did the Windows Update it became unbootable. Several other things have caused it to either crash or become unbootable including the ODBC drivers for the database we use at work. The only things I've seen work consistantly well are other Microsoft products. I've gone back to XP for now because I can't run the software I need to do my job on Vista.
1,Giving Mac s a fighting chance,"Everything about Vista to a tradition windows user is wrong. I am not sure what Microsoft was thinking. Perhaps they felt their traditional OS was not cute enough for users which is why Apple's sales were increasing. There solution was to sacrifice their advantage in speed and flexibility in favor of a pretty OS with lots of bells and whistles. What windows users got was a slower, annoying and overall pain in the butt to work with OS. Thank God I only switched one of my computers over to Vista and and keep my other on XP. IF you are smart you will either stay with XP or sell out and get a MAC. I hate Mac so I will stick with XP until something better then both Vista and Win 7 comes out and gives me what I want (Speed and flexibility). Dear Bill Gates I don't want a cute computer that my grandma can use. I want one that is fast as hell and never asks me if I am sure if I want to do something. That is what my virus protection is for."
1,Downgrade,"If you like a slow, incompatable computer, and making remote support nearly impossible, this OS is for you. XP is an upgrade by comparison."
2,Stay with XP,"I'm not a tech guy. But from a simple user's standpoint, there is no reason whatsoever to change unless you just have to have a small change in appearance. About 1/2 the software you might have purchased that worked with XP won't work with Vista.I was thinking that Vista would be an improvement. But there is nothing there. Just some minor superficial changes as far as I can tell. Maybe for IT people, there might be some big difference, but for your average user, there is no improvement at all.Save your money. Don't buy it."
2,Not worth it!,Yes its not worth it! very expensive no drivers available your old antivirusalong with most of your XP softwares will not work with Vista and compared to XP Vista is very complicated and needs more Ram the only good thing about it is its slick appearance my advice stick with XP because Vista brings nothing new to the table and the DRM is excessive in Vista i went back to XP after 2 days of installing Vista its just not ready yet maybe ill install it again after a year or soo.
1,"Stay with XP, Ubuntu, etc.....","My computer had an electrical problem here in South America where I'm temporarily working and it was unusable.I had to buy another laptop immediately and wound up with Home Basic in the spanish language. I thought I could easily change this to english. Not so easy!I have to buy Ultimate at $399, $28 sales tax, $120 Colombia tax to get the backup disk, and $35 to mail it to me, making a grand total of about $572.00. the computer only cost $750. So I have to pay almost $600 more just to get the english language.Hewlett Packard says tough luck. If I had bought a Toshiba, they would have changed the Home Basic spanish to Home Basic english at no charge.I see no need for Vista or Hewlett Packard."
2,Be prepared to spend a lot of time making basic things work,"I have spent hours and have yet to get my home network nor email working.Vista randomly decides that my XP Home computers are not secure (even though for years Microsoft has been saying they are) and refuses to even show they exist. When it does show them, it still refuses to let me copy files to them because they are not secure. So, now per Vista's recommendation I have a full backup of my hard drive on that hard drive in case it fails (since it would be insecure to have it on another hard drive.)So far it is unable in to install Office 2000. This would be fine except it refuses to import my emails until I install it.Other key applications like my password safe, etc. are still unable to install.It is, however, a very nice looking application to surf the web with. But, I'm not sure that's worth the money."
1,Neither the consumer nor Vista are ready. Wait a year. Buy a good computer,"I tried Vista. I sell and repair computers. If you want to work with Vista without a glitch follow this tips:1) Wait until the first Service Pack it's out.2) Buy a State of the Art computer with components and programs manufactured after the first half of 2007.3) Get the OS preinstalled, not retail.4) Forget about all your old software."
2,Very slow,"Much, much slower than Windows XP even after a clean install. The slowness is everywhere and very frustrating. Numerous devices failed to work on my Dell laptop after attempting an upgrade."
3,nice new features but not stable,"There are a lot of new features in Windows Vista Ultimate that I like, and after I purchased a new convertible notebook with it installed and solved some early glitches (incompatible software) it ran pretty well. But after only a few months it started crashing almost daily, and now it crashes several times per day. Sometimes it's a blue sreen, sometimes it freezes up, sometimes it just randomly reboots. The product was relased prematurely; it is not robust, nor as stable as Windows XP and Windows 2000. I am considering doing a clean install of Windows XP, which will be a hassle and will force me to give up some of the nice features of Vista like the Photo Gallery. But I would rather have a stable system."
1,Windows ULTIMATE GARBAGE OS,"This OS is not for any ordinary user. If you know nothing about drivers, peripherals, etc, then don't get this OS. Lots of incompatability issues. I thought this OS would make my gaming experience better, apparently it needs lots of work. Can't play CS:S, Day of Defeat, Lord of the rings Online, etc. BF2142 and some other games play slower in Vista compared to XP. I hardly write reviews, but I just want everyone to know that this OS suxs! Stay with XP Pro SP2. Games move faster and load better and encoding video and editing software runs much much better on XP. It isn't worth getting right now, wait a year or two until it gets worked out. Feels like BETA, which it shouldn't. Microsoft, you get a F- for your new OS. You fail. Nice try!"
2,Not Impressed,"Windows Vista is just another flawed operating system from Microsoft. I have been using the RTM version that my company received and even on pretty good hardware this OS is a resource hog. A lot of applications do not run on Vista so watch out. All Microsoft applications run fine, but not every app you use is Microsoft is it? Warning! Linux users if you use tools to connect to Linux systems beware, I got a blue screen of death a few times trying to run PuTTY and No Machine. The Aero ""Glass"" effect is not impressive, especially since it's been used (and looks better) on Mac OS and a lot of versions of Linux. I will wait before purchasing Vista until application vendors and Microsoft work out all the kinks. IMO, wait awhile after release to let them work out the kinks as they did with Windows XP."
2,Not worth the upgrade,Windows Vista copies heavily from Mac Os X. Basically it is Windows XP with a new look. It is not right to force the consumers to buy new hardware by making an OS run slower.
1,WORST MICROSOFT WINDOWS VERSION EVER RELEASED,"I beta tested Microsoft Windows Vista Ultimate 32 Bit and 64 Bit Editions during six months. Microsoft Windows Vista Ultimate RC2 (Build 5744) was not reliable at all.I expect that the RTM version to be even more slow, unefficient and user-unfriendly. In spite of five years of development, Microsoft have once again proven to be uncapable to release a decent OS.I am currently using Red Hat Linuz, which almost free (40 bucks) and, hey, Linux never crashes and is better and faster than anything Microsoft could ever put out."
2,Spent a lot of money on a PC ... switching to the mac,"I spent $2,000 on a Dell laptop. Also, I upgraded to Vista Ultimate and Office Ultimate. This software is so damn junky! It doesn't work! Office works terribly on Vista, constantly freezing and crashing.After 10 years of PC use, I've got an Apple computer coming in the mail right now.... I'm DONE with Microsoft!!"
1,Best thing that ever happened.......to Apple.,"After getting a new computer at work complete with Vista and Office 2007, I've decided that I won't be upgrading my home computer or my laptop computer any time soon. I used to upgrade every 2 or 3 years, but if I have to work with this garbage, I'll use my old hardware with XP and Office 2003 as long as possible. Then I'll make the move to Apple. Sorry Dell, my complaint isn't with you. From a simple productivity point of view, Vista (and Office 2007) are HUGE steps backward. And to think they're actually charging for these upgrades. They should actually be paying me to use them."
1,Very broken,"Not to beat a dead, stinking horse, but here's another Fun Vista Feature:After indexing one of my drives, ALL searches now come up empty, even as I am looking at the files. This includes email searches within Outlook 2007 (which has its own share of issues, starting with its slower than molasses speed, even on an OC'd 3.2 ghz/2gig/PC8000 box.)Well, I will say the failed searches makes you forget about the other little stuff, like your inability to save how folders look, or to know what the defragmenter is actually doing."
1,This software really needs a 0 stars option,"Its amazing, I never thought that my nice new high end pc would be able to find MORE compatable drivers for ubuntu than I can find for vista. Simply put I tried to install, which took forever and crashed a few times forcing me to start ALL OVER AGAIN.Now I just have to wait for my antivirus software to release a new version (even though this one claimed to be vista compatable) get working video card drivers, buy a new monitor and... oh never mind... Ill just return this POS software."
4,Vista Ultimate OS,Best OS since W2K Professional and certainly much better than XP which is as poor in my estimation as the old Windows 95. T had been using Vista Ultimate in Beta and then in C-1 for past year prior to this purchase.
2,Lot's of problems,"I have had the misfortune to work with Vista on my laptop for 2 years. It is very bad, and I have had lot's of problems with programs crashing for no good reason other than running on a Vista PC. Further more the ""blue screen of death"" has teased me many times, and always when I have made something really important (murphy's law I suppose).I have now switched to Windows 7 which seems a lot more stable."
3,vista ultimate,Have to say I prefer XP over Vista. Vista even set in classic mode does not show the progress of some programs like defragmenter. Vista is also lacking the internet games I enjoy with XP.
1,went back to xp -- forget trying to do pro audio with vista!,"do not buy this.fewer software/hardware companies really care enough to release working drivers for vista because they know its a flop.i got this with a laptop, and i wish i had the option to take xp, but certain laptop manufacturers are in bed with microsoft.dont be an annoying jerk and need to impress others with how much like a mac your pc looks. you want to use a computer because it works, not so you can pretend you are doing stuff and look like a moron who paid too much for their equipment... (like a big portion of mac users are!)i went back to xp and didnt look back! dont be fooled by the nicer looking solitaire game and whatnot. believe me, its not worth it.forget doing pro audio on vista, by the way. you will meet only frustration."
2,Not for beginners,"It looks very pretty and has some usefull features, but if you are planning to upgrade your OS, or adding a new computer to an existing system, watch out. Consult the Vista compatability list carefully, most of your existing periphials, scanners, printservers, printers, Non Microsoft games and applications may not work, and drivers are not available. Purchase only if you plan on replacing most of your periphials. My printer is less than 6 months old, and although the company states it is Vista compatible, the drivers in Vista do not work, the printer company does not have standalone drivers, and does not intend to release any."
2,"Vista is Buggy, Buggy, Buggy","Quite simply, Vista is a mess. Very buggy. Many programs and such that don't run well, or at all, with Vista. The more I discover, the more I find out. I second the opinion of many who have submitted reviews -- stick with XP for as long as possible, unless you are buying a new PC or notebook, then, of course, you are stuck with Vista! Microsoft should be ashamed. I am ready to switch to a MAC!"
1,Horible Experiment gone bad,"Vista should get no stars. We are all beta testers for Mad Doctor FrankenGates. I hope he burns inhell for all the trouble he has caused with this junk known as Vista. Microjunk is so worried about themselves and their profits, they have forgotten how to take care of their customers. Don't waste your money on any more micro-junk, buy a Mac like I did. You will not be disappointed.Microsoft vista......What a joke!"
1,Bill need a recall on this one. Wish I could go back to XP,"Aside from some pleasant pictures, this is a BAD improvement over something that worked well. Worse yet is to get the Bundle with the new Word and Excel, which are terrible. Fortunately, I have another computer with the older versions on it. So, if I have a sophisticated Word document, I have some recourse."
1,Terribly Frustrating,"Vista came on my new computer and a dark day it was. I should have replaced the bad hard drive on the old one and loaded XP. Five days straight and I have had to 1.purchase new printer 2. purchase new Office Suite 3. purchase new Norton even though I renewed in September. 4. purchase new Quickbooks 5. Probably have to replace my scanner since Microsoft says it is incompatable. Family Treemaker does not work. Buy a $600 computer and get to spend another $1500 on programs and equipment. WHAT A DEAL!! No wonder Gates has billions, he makes it on slick deals like this. R.E.T."
1,BAD BUY,"INSTALLED, BUT MANY OF MY PROGRAMS DONT WORK , ALSO GRAPHIC CARD, SOUND CARD RUN POORLY. I ENDED UP REMOVING THIS SOFTWARE THAT WAS NOT READY FOR RELEASE !BOUGHT 2, I AM OUT, OVER 700.00 ! CAN WE GET A REFUND ?"
4,Easy for use but......,It's a good one....but be sure you that have've got all nesecary drivers that work with vista cos' luky for me i didn't have any internet problems so i downloaded everything but i might be a problem!
4,Vista Ultimate,"This, being a bargain, was the original version. I had to do quite a bit of updating to make it current. However, I am happy with the cost, the delivery, and even VISTA! I had read a lot of bad, but I really like it."
2,Is this supposed to be an improvement?,"I have countless issues with Vista Ultimate-without Service Pack 1. My ""Vista-certified"" hardware is always having trouble functioning. Downloading new drivers has proved futile. I fix one problem, and then another shows up. I thought this was supposed to be an improvement over XP? What a downer... Get a Mac, they work far better."
1,Not what you want,They took away all the things you were used to and replaced it with slowness. Why???
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!!!,"This is the worse OS that I have ever worked with. I am sick and tired of fighting with it everytime I just want to rename a file. (the pointer keeps changing into a ""clock"" and booting me out of the prompt). I ASSume that its the indexer, but am tired of dealing with it and the many other things this joke of an OS does to use up resources. (btw, I bought a very highend system that had vista home premium preloaded)Dont get vista!!"
1,The Cost is Ridiculous!,"Regardless of the details, good or bad, of the operating system, it's silly expensive! The Premium Upgrade versions force you to install it on top of XP. Wow... isn't that great! One of the most aggregious examples of Corporate Greed I've seen in years!"
3,"OK, but don't expect too much!","I have used the official company ultimate version for about a month now and i will cut right to the chase. unfortunately the cons outweigh the pros....pro: more modern interface, somewhat more securer, better networkingcon: way too expensive, vista is more like an upgrade than an entirely new OS, some menues (like windows explorer) are very confusing, several popular programs (divx, quicktime) do NOT work right, or at all, including some MS programs (visual studio, sql server)verdict: unless you like to have the latest of everything or the money doesn't matter, keep on using xp until the first vista service pack."
1,"Ghastly, ghastly!","Don't bother! This compilation bases its validity on the fact that they were recorded when major revivals of the pieces were being directed by Gilbert in the early twentieth century. However, none of the recorded performers were members of the company, so, apart from the fact that they probably saw the odd matinee, it does not have much to recommend it, particularly when the results are so variable. Being an acoustic recording, the orchestrations are heavily revised and the sound is fairly horrible. The most interesting results are the snatches of dialogue. For besotted devotees only."
5,What I needed,I don't have standard eves on my house because it's too old. Menard's doesn't carry them anymore. I'm glad Amazon does. Just what I needed.
5,Gutter elbow,"This product is a good product but the size of the elbow was a bit small for the job. It is a good product and I would buy from this company in the future, but I would have to make sure the size is correct."
3,Kind of lame without the battery kit,"It's bright. It's easy to use. However, it's anchored to the wall with a plug. Kind of lame having a cord stretched across the bed to use it. It does make reading easier though. Look for the kit that includes the battery"
1,Very small cutting board,"Very small cutting board - 12"" x 7 1/2"". Not what I thought it was going to be. Thought it would be 12"" x 12"". Wish I had known this before ordering. While the color is indeed purple and fits well on the counter, it will only hold a litle bit of content."
1,"HIGHLY DISSAPOINTED (Got a theory, though!)","Hi good people,I'd like to say that I was highly dissapointed with the selections of WOW GOSPEL 2003. It's my speculation that some of these artists must've paid to have their music included in the listings. Why else would there be a ""new artist spotlight"" from artists no one has ever heard about? Who determines whether people wanna hear these artists or don't? How did the compilers hear about these people anyway and most of the listening public didn't?Why didn't they include ""Your mercy"" by Blessed? Or ""Constantly"" by the Rev. Clay Evans? Or ""Caught Up"" from Shirley Caesar and Kirk? I have yet to see ""Mississippi Po' Boy"" in their listings from years past to the present.If you guys(WOW music producers) are listening I have a great suggestion: why don't you let the gospel audience go online and vote for the best songs of the year?You might lose your ""cut"" from these ""new"" artists but you will sell more CDs.Thank you!"
2,Very disappointed,"Never had purchased anything from the WOW series....probably won't purchase another again... I love gospel music, but this is far from being among the best of the best"
1,ALSO DISSAPPOINTED!,"I thought that this cd was going to be off the chain but it wasnt! A lot of these songs, I have'nt even heard before. More than half of these songs are'nt tight at all. The only songs I really enjoy listening to is TWO of them: I NEED YOU NOW and PRAISE IS WHAT I DO! I was suprised that a lot of songs were not on there. For example, I think that Marvin Sapp could have made it on there with ""There is None Like You."" Overall the cd was'nt great."
2,Why?,I want to know why does every wow gospel not include the best songs of the previous year as advertised? That's false advertising Verity!! Its sad that the best song are never included. Who pick some of these songs? marymary album came out in 2000 but its just now showing up?
2,this is again a bad collection,"This wow gospel 2003 is an insult to gospel music. do the people at verity listen at all to true radio, or are they just in the business of supporting their own artists?Where is Kirk's Hosanna, Cece's Anybody Wanna Pray, Yolanda AdamsNever Give Up, or Nicole C Mullen's Call on Jesus?I am disappointed that they always include Yolanda's old hits. How about her new music? How about Mary Mary's new song ""In the Morning? Nicole C Mullen is a black artist and she sings gospel."
3,Not What I Expected,"I loved WOW Gospel 2002! I thought the follow up would have the same impact or better which turned out to be a bit disappointing. I like Praise is What I do, Anthem of Praise, and a couple others. WOW 2002 is 100X better than 2003. On 2003, they have an old Yolanda Adams song from one of her old CDs (not even the most recent one). I was surprised Kirk Frankin wasn't on it. Save your $! If you haven't purchased WOW Gospel 2002 please do!"
2,Diappointed as well,Like so many of the previous reviewers I am disappointed by the cd. I also noticed that the cd has on it that this is the best compilation ever and I beg to differ. First of all I thought the pupose of WOW was to give you the top songs for the previous year...seems to me lots of these songs were very old. They have been out for quite sometime. Now if they wanted to use these songs and didnt use them when they were out they should come out with a WOW Gospel Mixture Cd or something but I think they should stick to putting the songs that were made in the previous year. Im not certain if they are putting the songs that were popular even though they were made 3-4 years ago could that be what they are doing?
5,Absolutely wonderful.,"This tape is a great learning tool for children of ALL ages. It teaches through song, simple things such as the alphabet, going shopping, etc.. I can't think of a better way to learn, than through music because it make it fun for both child and parent. We listen to it while driving so the errands don't seem so long. Another great thing about the cassette is that there are children singing, so children are able to capture the excitement. All songs are sung in English and Italian. Simply wonderful."
2,Shoddily built.,"When my son-in-law tried to hang the easel for my 5-year-old granddaughter, the screws gave in ant it fell apart. He managed to repair as well as he could because she was crying. I should get another type of easel for her, on legs maybe."
4,Definitely worth buying.,"I too must agree that these four gentlemen have produced a very fine album that covers a wide variety of genres. They had obviously put a lot of work into these particlular pieces and, even though all of them are branching out into solo careers, manage to work well as a group. My favourites are the Haydn, Serocki and No more Blues, even though (dare I say it) I prefer some interpretations by other quartets (eg. Triton Trombone Quartet playing the Serocki). I personally feel that the recording quality lets them down a bit at times. The 2nd & 3rd trombones in particular sound a little 'fuzzy' from time to time; whether that's the recording or perhaps their horn I can't say. Nevertheless I have been inspired once again to practice diligently upon listening to this CD. It's worth the money."
4,"Insight, Detail and Passion","I had a great time listening to the songs while I read about them. I love the way he describes the songs one by one in detail, the insight he offers that cleared up a lot of guessing (Who played on what etc.) He also has an obvious passion for George's music which probably matters most. His opinions are not typical which is a relief. (i.e. He actually likes ""Gone Troppo"", me too) It's a great book and a lot of work went into it. This is a George book that I will keep. ""I Me Mine"" (written by George himself) and ""Harrison"" from Rolling Stone Publications are the other two."
2,Don't bother reading this,"I am both a student of the early Christian church and a faithful LDS Christian. This book is dated and slanted, and often it appears the author doesn't quite understand certain early Christian beliefs. It is interesting as a Latter-day Saint to see how some mid-20th century Mormons viewed the apostasy, but it isn't a real contributor to one's knowledge and I never felt I could quite trust what was being said, especially after finding a few flaws about history or theology that should have been understood by the author. This book is for people interested in LDS culture and history, not really for anyone interested in the history of the Christian church."
2,Not what I expected,A little confusing to understand. Bought this to give to customers to save time but the LED's don't coinside with the monitors so it's confusing as to when the vehicle is ready for smog testing. Directions are vague.
2,"Might be a great book, but IS a bad print.","Here, I just want to make a comment on the quality of reproduction quality of the book, not the contents. I have never seen such a bad print in maybe last 20 years. The printing method is so horrible that I can not believe it is a $25-worth commercial book. It does look like just a personal xerox copy version. Regarding the quality, it should be under $5."
4,Celtic Art,"beautiful piece of work... when I think of the word ""tapestry,"" I think of thick material. This item's material is thinner than woven material, but that is what I wanted. I personally like it quite a bit."
1,Butchered and no Songs,"Sorry folks, but they did it again. They placed the title of the DVD collection at the not-low-enough right of the frame, where it stays constantly visible throughout the programs; AND they cut out every single one of the Dean Martin songs as well as other parts of the show, INCLUDING some of the Martin & Lewis scenes!! For instance, on CD4, Show #1, the ""Chapters"" listing has a routine called ""Jerry's Everywhere!"", but this skit is nowhere to be found anywhere in the collection, and so you miss one of the funniest bits they ever did.Don't buy this set.Hey producers, you out there? Anybody listening? Give us the uncut versions with the option to skip the main titles and the commercials. No, I don't want to watch every show all the way through, but let ME CHOOSE what I want to watch or not watch."
3,"It's good, but it could be great!!","Martin & Lewis in every endeavor, but most importantly in their Colgate shows, were the epitome of ""The Golden Age of Television."" Never will you see two men equally do all they can to make their audience laugh without completely humiliating themselves. Their movies would never completely show case the comedic talents of Dean Martin, but the show always would! Which leads me to the only flaw I found with this DVD set; you can see the two men in all their comedic glory, but you can barely hear Dean sing anything. Yes, all of Dean Martin's solo spots behind the microphone doing what he does best is extracted from every episode. So, laugh your bum off, but for newcomers you will only bare witness to half of the history."
3,Expected more.,"I was expecting more depth from a book like this. Instead we have some simple meditations and exercises that don't quite resonate with my need for deep ecological connection with the earth. I'm still reading, but what I've read so far hasn't gotten me any closer to where I want to be or hasn't taken me anywhere new."
5,Great!,Sorry Im late to write a review.. but its exactly what I wanted. great book.. to open our eyes to what really foes on around us. ( unseen) thank you
5,Truthful Expose of the New Age Movement,"Shocking expose of the nature of New Age Movement and Spiritism entering ""Christian"" churches. A must read for those who wish to be ready."
4,Notable for its casting,"Though the episode aired two years prior to man's initial landing on the moon, ""Moonshot"" posed an interesting guestion: What if alien invaders did try to sabotage the lunar landing by having a double on board? B-movie star John Ericson has the role of the ""doppelganger"" while a pre-""Mission Impossible"" Peter Graves plays the head of NASA security. Joanne Linville is the astronaut's suspicious wife while character actor Strother Martin plays a beachcomber that witnesses a murderous assault by the aliens on fishing astronauts.The episode also features other fixtures of 60's television: Ross Elliott, Richard X. Slattery, Anthony Eisley, and Kent Smith, the latter who would later join star Roy Thinnes in ""The Invaders"" second, and last, season."
3,"Hoped for more ,got less!","I got this atlas thinking it was going to be like the atlas I got as a gift years ago.I bought it as a gift for my nieces and nephews but It did not even draw a glance from them.For one thing its too small and although the Information Is good, the artwork Is somewhat dry and unatractive to most youngters.I hope that they put more pictures, charts, and sidebar Information, ( although the maps are good)If they decide to revise these books, because they are worth having!"
1,Not completely satisfied,I ordered the bundle believing it was the system/software bundle.I only received the games. The description said bundle leading me to believe it was both.
3,good for advanced student,"I think this dictionary would be good for someone who already has a good knowledge base of bangla. For someone learning it is a bit difficult. It only goes bengali to english. So you have to know the word in bengali! Other than that it seems good. I'm just waiting until I learn a little more, then can really get some use out of it."
1,Item is always out of stock,"I agree with one of the prior reviews - it is a shame that Amazon advertises this product as being available when it actually is not. Several weeks after the order was made, and after I was assured a second time that it would be available at a later date, I was informed that this item is not avaialable. The advertisement for this item should be removed so that more people are not disappointed. Bad job, Amazon."
5,VoodDoo Magic Works!,"I bought this as a gift for someone who didn't really care for a coworker. After a few weeks of stabbing it with the included pins, this person actually gave notice and left their position. We broke the this open at a friends house where we all laughed as we took turns poking he doll as if it was some crazy ritual. It's a great fun and entertaining product and may actually solve your beef with that ""special someone"". Give it a shot or should I say ""needle"" today and see if you can change the future outcome of your selected individual."
1,NOT AVAILABLE - DO NOT ORDER!!!!,"I ordered this 6 months ago as a Christams gift. Amazon FINALLY emailed me admitting that they do not carry this product, yet it is still list on the website at $9.95????"
5,Good computer,This computer has been working out great since I bought it about 3 months ago. With the coax hookup in the back my monitor will double as a TV and it even comes with a remote. The card readers located on the front are very convenient as is the USB port on the front. There are 4 more USB ports located on the back which is way more than I need right now but it's good to know that when I do need them they will be there. It has room for 2GB RAM which is nice. You can put this computer almost anywhere because of it's size. The only downside I see is the lack of room for expansion. That hasn't really been an issue for me at this point though.
5,Good product difficult to find,Very good product even though a slight delay in shipping was recived in a timely manner
2,Be Careful,"Be Careful. I have the earlier version of this Slimline, s7220n. Mine developed an overheating power supply when creating DVDs. It only has a 108 watt power supply, which is rather low for all the devices attached. I did a google search and found many others who had similar problems. HP would not acknowledge a problem existed. Had to buy a new power supply from them."
5,ALL HAIL ICP AND MIKE E. CLARKE,"Juggalos....Where to begin!!.Ok..... Firist of all the Album is one of their best ever. The one the only Willaby Raggs makes a return for ya earlobes and the Intro is just out of this world. Picture ICP now doing old skool Juggaalo Sh*t. The remix of Homies is amazing and better than the original. The other songs are just too much to take in....The excitment, feeling, terror, freshness all hits at once. Trust me Ninjas and even if you aint a Juggalo, This album is Purely Amazing. Simple as That."
3,Great Jahnz Vocals,"I will admit, this album is very good. However, I tend to wonder why there are 5 songs on this CD that ""originally"" appeared on Gary Richrath's Solo Album simply titled ""RICHRATH"". Michael Jahnz is a better singer than Cronin on Gary's CD. I just wished Gary Richrath would of kept writing songs on his own, and kept Jahnz for the vocals. This guy can really belt them out. Anyway, get this CD, and also pick up ""RICHRATH"". Both have the talent of an awesome singer..""Michael Jahnz"""
3,Shop around b4 buying,"Great item. I really wanted one w/ my first child. I decided it was a necessity for my 2nd, especially since I'm short. We are very much enjoying it. My only gripe is that it really could stand to be a little wider. I saw another one for a similar price advertised particuarly on the point of being wider. Just something to consider. Also, I now realize that the matching ottoman to go w/ your glider is worth it. In comfort, this product pales in comparison."
5,Lovely Music for a great game - a must have for the PSO fan,"Put away that tape recorder, close the sound test screen, and get ready. This CD has nearly every song used in Phantasy Star Online. A complete soundtrack that actually sounds better than the quality used in the game is hard to come by. With musical gems such as World With Me, A Whole New World, and Rose Confession, this OST will drive PSO players and fans wild, and spark interest in people who haven't even heard of PSO.Sound quality is perfect, with stable volume throughout the CD. Every song is played out completely, not just one little half minute loop. Both Episode I and II are completely tranposed on this two disc set, which will not disappoint.The only better version is the rare Premium Arrange, which I recommend you get along with this OST."
5,I LOVE THIS THING!!!,"This is one od my FAVORITE albums ever!!! i can't get enough of the song ""tricktrack"" its one of my favorite songs ever! i used to play the game but stopped after my 264 hours of gameplay got corrupted, but when idid play i would go to a certain level just to hear tricktrack.It's a bit pricy but i got mine omn ebay for around $20, but i think it is still worth the amazon.com price.the only reason i gave this 5 stars is......because 5 is the highest!"
2,Phantasy Star Online Songs of Ragol Odyssey,"Got most tof the tracks from the game missing a fue key ones, got a due you might not have heard the planet dreamcast web site has the listing, sadly it doesn't live up to the cost I feel"
3,Reproducible lab worksheets?,"I like the simulation aspect of this software. However, its claim to include ""40 reproducible lab worksheets"" is extremely misleading. I could not find them. When I contacted the makers of the software, they responded by directing me to the ""labs"" button. The ""labs"" button gives access to some 40 printable lab schematics. I was expecting a printable worksheet for each lab giving instructions and asking some exploratory questions for the student to answer. There are no instructions on how to use the labs that I could find, nor are there any reproducible worksheets as most people would understand the term ""worksheets"". This program is probably OK if you are knowledgeable and don't mind verbally leading a student through various ""virtual"" experiments or making up your own worksheets."
4,"Few problems, cool-looking","The AR remote has very sleek looks and a good feel to it, I like how it looks with the backlight on. It controls, my TV, amplifier, stereo, DishNetwork receiver, dvd player, ceiling light/fan (w/ a Lutron Maestro IR switch, media on laptop, and tower fan; I love showing off my ""smart room,"" which I saved on with this remote.It IS a two-handed remote, which might not be what some of you are looking for. I had several isues while and after learning from my notebook's remote, but I eventually got it working. Also, I experienced some screen freezing issues, but they went away after replacing the batteries.overall, a great product for the price!"
1,Nearly Useless - It's Going Back,"I suppose if you had the most rudimentary setup of a cable box, TV, VCR and DVD player, this remote might be worth considering. However, it doesn't work well at all with new TV's, sophisticated receivers, etc. This remote wasn't state of the art in 2004 when it was manufactured.The buttons are pre-programmed, meaning you can only reprogram those buttons that have been assigned to a particular type of component. No new buttons can be added to a layout and you cannot rename them, other than by choosing between a couple of defaults already programmed in. I tried multiple times to give a button a custom name, save it and it would never show.The real killer of the whole deal is the fact that it doesn't recognize the signals from my remotes, so it won't learn anything. I don't know if it's a defect or what, but it's not worth the hassle to find out. I'd rather spend the money and get a Harmony Remote that actually works right."
1,Don't waste your money!,"First off everything looked good- my components could turn on and off but programing the specific keys the universal remote would not detect any of my original remotes. Customer service is terrible and I got some lame excuse- Sorry , we don't guarantee our ""Universal"" Remote is compatible! Huh? Go figure, then why do they call it a Universal Remote. Price wise great, but you get what you pay for these days. I returned mine."
4,Hard to push buttons,"Great remote. It works great as a learning remote. It was able to learn all my remotes and all my devices even. The only problem I had was the touchscreen was a little sketchy. In this, I mean, you gotta really push down hard to actually ""push"" the button on the touch screen. but other than that, awesome remote."
3,"Good, but need light","It is a good remote and once programed, makes it easier with macros to turn on and set several A/V electronic items together. Main complaint is backlighting and writing on touch screen is very dim. Unless your eyesight is 20/20 or better {mine isn't anymore} it may be hard to read in some lighting conditions; particularly in brighter rooms. OK for the price I bought it for, but probably wouldn't pay over $60 for it as there are others which are now better."
3,Great for backstory,"I'm a huge Wildcats fan and Warren Ellis made me fall in love with Stormwatch. These stories aren't as clever as as Alan Moore's take on the Wildcats or, Ellis' run on Stormwatch. However, if you want good old fashion slugfest in tights fun, it's entertaining. At the very least, it's a nice middle point and some more background on some of my favorite comic book characters."
5,Great cover at a great price,"After doing some research on different styles of covers, I decided on the Access Tonnosport. This is a GREAT cover!!! Really good quality, very easy to install (recommend using 2 people) and an unbeatable price. Thanks Amazon"
2,Confusing,This game is very complicated and my daughter put it down and never picked it back up. I also tried it and could not understand
4,That's So Raven Psychic,"Brought this game for my daughter for Christmas. She loves it!! It is now Mid February, and she still playing it! This is her second one. The first one was stolen by a jealous friend."
3,Not getting played,"My 9-year-old daughter got this as a Christmas gift. She has played it once. Just doesn't interest her. I played the timed, restaurant serving portion of the game and it was okay. I could see it getting boring."
5,Excellent Footage & Audio,"I purchased this on DVD back in 2005 and thought the video was of poor quality and very amateur, but this Blu Ray edition is simply amazing. The video and audio is really good. They really put some time into editing this footage. I took a chance at purchasing this again and I'm really glad I did!"
3,"Excellent concert, recording could be better",It is definetely great to see Tupac in concert and good audio. Unfortunately I find that the recording for this concert could be better and more defined. I guess remastering is just to expensive these days.
1,No chegou no prazo,"O produto ainda no foi entregue a data prevista foi 29 de agosto 2011, por isso estou chateado visto que no foi respeitado o prazo."
1,order canceled,"I ordered this product and the order was canceled with no explanation. I then checked the site, and the exact same shoe was available again. I was planning on giving the shoes to someone as a gift, and now I can't. Poor business practice."
4,21 unique ZZ tracks produced by Swamp Dogg!,"Blues At The Opera? It's an ambituous concept and who better to attempt it than the late Z.Z Hill along with material from Gary U.S Bonds & Swamp Dogg ? There's even narration provided by WZZA dj/owner Bob Carl Bailey. That's just the first chunk of stuff here. Great phat liner package from producer Jerry Williams a.k.a Swamp Dogg lays out the facts & hoo haw surrounding these relatively obscure Muscle Shoals & L.A recordings. Suffice to say much mid-60's money marauding & meddling kept Z.Z Hill reticent to do biz with shysters like Phil Walden, Quin Ivy etc. After some legal wrangling Swamp Dogg was able to get an injunction lifted and get Z.Z back on the charts in the mid 70's and into the early 80's with some of this material. Jerry has also included some bonus type revamped ""collector's versions"" with newer instrumentations. Not every note is notable, but the total 21 song package has it's merits."
1,Junk Food,"It should be the responsibility of editors and publishers to recognize real talent and sort it out from wanna-be copy cat writings. Surely there's better than this out there. It's a stretch to even give this series one star. I will not feed my children fast food. The only thing that keeps this series from being total junk is that much attention is obviously paid to grammar. Obviously a lot of toil, but common as TP."
1,AWFUL,"This book was AWFUL! It didn't captivate me or pull me in like good books do! If you want a good book than get ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" by J. K. Rowling, if you like that than in June by her second novel in that series called ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets"", which is definetally better but you need the first book to explain most of the second book, and in mid-September her third book called ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" is coming out and though I haven't read it I'm sure that it will be excellent, and I read that she will have seven books in that series so you can be sure to read seven excellent books all of which I rated or will rate *****."
4,"Great, not perfect","I just finished reading this to my 8-year-old son, and we both enjoyed it. We have read all of the Harry Potter series, which was an obvious point of comparison. First off, my son kept repeating, as we got further into the text, ""This is so much better than Harry Potter."" That is quite an endorsement, since he likes the Potter books a great deal.While this book is filled with interesting characters and details, there are obviously some limitations to what you can develop in so few pages. However, in the end I thought the details that were included in this text left Harry Potter looking a bit cartoonish. We both enjoyed the descriptions of of inner workings of the spells as they were cast.I think this book is great for reading aloud and would also work for slightly older kids reading to themselves. However, it is clearly no Lord of the Rings, nor does it pretend to be."
4,It's Murda!,"This is a pretty tight record. Although many of the songs are annoyingly the same thing, it's good enough to last a while.Some of the hottest points are ""Down 4 U"" which features Ja Rule, Ashanti, Vita, and Charli Baltimore. That's the best 1 on the album.Another tight one is ""Ain't It Funny"", the J.Lo and Ja remix that waz featured on J.Lo's remix cd J TO THE LO! THE REMIXES.Some of the others that are cool are ""It's Murda"", ""Gangstafied"", and ""Rain"".So, 4 the fact that i kept this cd in my cd player more than 5 minutes, i give ""Irv Gotti Presents: The Inc"" 4 stars."
1,NO!NO!NO! more of this please!!!!!,"Yeah this is probably the worst compilation I've heard in my entire life (worst than Dr. Dre's Aftermath compilation, i love dre but that just wasn't good). This album features music that is just the same over and over again. Actually very annoying to hear everytime on the radio and people saying ""oh yeah that's tight."" Ja Rule used to be puttin it down before he got into down a** chick songs and other wack stuff. Ja you need to start rappin and not singing cause it ain't workin' for some of us. For those who think this is ish then you need to start looking outside those billboard charts. You have some talent murda inc., but you're just using it in the wrong way."
1,The world's most wack record label.,"I am so tried of seeing this 1 star(ja) record label talk about how tight they are. Who cares about the rest of the inc. If ja rule were to leave the label, it would be nothing. After I listened to this horrible c.d. , it made me want to go out and buy ONYX'S wack c.d. I can't tell them apart. They both are garbage. I can't understand why irv gotti would want to take his shirt off video's what is he thinking. After this c.d. I will say that lil' romeo has more skills on the mic than ja rule. Yes this poppy collection of song made it into my wack list."
3,It's ok,This cd is ok but it seems like on every song but the singles they were saying the same things over and over again.Caddilac Tah and Charli Baltimore definitly helped on this cd and I think that if they got some recognition they could actually be in the same rank as Ja and Ashanti.
3,"Not the best, Not the worst","I listened to this cd from start to finish the first day I bought it. Though the majority of the songs are tolerable, they are not all great. However, most of the songs with Cadillac Tah are great and along with Charli Baltimore's appearances the cd is worth buying. I would definitley recommmend this cd."
3,Not bad not great,"This album is decent but it aint great...But i have to say the best song on the album is nexx nigguz..that song is amazing especially crooked i's part...and to that person that reviewed it earlier get ur facts straigh eastwood and crooked i are on tha row and they are 2 of the best emcees out right now...i cant stop listening to that track its just too hot i cant wait for crooked i's album,go request his single so damn hood ft. sisqo on ur local stations....the album id say is worth picking up but dont expect to be blown away by this release..."
4,ITS GOOD GOOD... MURDER I.N.C.,"WELL WELL WELL, I GOT THIS ALBUM THE DAY IT CAME OUT. I LIKE IT SO MUCH. IT SHOWS THAT THE INC. IS GOING TO BE A FORCE TO BE CAREFUL OF. I LOVE TRACKS 4 (NO ONE DOES IT BETTER BY CHARLI BALTIMORE AND ASHANTI: THESE 2 SOUND GREAT TOGETHER; CHARLI IS JUST PLAIN GGREAT) 5(ITS MURDAH: COOL SOUND AND ALL) 7(RIDE WIT US: JUST PLAIN AWESOME)! ITS A GOOD GOOD ALBUM. MURDER I.N.C. BABY"
4,Decent,"Not bad overall.I'll keep it short.This cd lacks only a few things..That's more of Ashanti,Vita, Charli Baltimore.The tracks they are on highlight the cd..Especially ""No one does it better"" which IMO is the best of all on the cd."
1,"OH,NOW I GET IT","OK so Irv Gotti is Suge Knight.Ja Rule is 2Pac.Ashanti is Aaliyah or Janet Jackson.Vita is Roxanne Shante.Charli Baltimoreis Lil' Kim.Oh,ok,so that's what you need to succeed in hip hopthese days? Just poorly recycle '90s success stories and copy other multi-million-making hip hop moguls.Got it."
3,I hope theres better to come!,"Being a huge fan of Ja i was a bit dissapointed to see his relatively small vocal contribution on this comp, but as i listened to it i realised that this was more of a promotional c.d. for alot of the up and coming Inc artists such as vita and cadhillac tah (who both proved to be more than adequete rappers, both lyrically and vocally). Ja was once again superb (when he was there) and ashantis' sultry voice fitted in perfectly to most songs. However the album was very inconsistent (as with all compilation record label albums). The best songs throughout the whole album proved to be coming from the one producer, 7 Aurelius, he hit the mark with every song contributed, such as ""down 4 u"", ""the pledge"", ""the rain"" and ""aint it funny"", without these songs the album is only worth about a two but if he had done the whole album it would have been at least a four!"
1,Irv Gotti Presents The Gayest Album Ever!,"what is the point of this cd?ja rule has gone from yelling MURDER, MURDER - to just one more pop singer. ja and his boys are soft, and all they rap about is being thugs, gangstas, hustlers, and O.G.'s!"
3,Good,"A better book that deals with rock legal/economic matters is ROCKONOMICS. A lot, if not most, of the Beatles stuff, for instance, that are in this book are in that book, but better written. Nonetheless, this book had stuff I hadn't known about before, and it confirms what Pete Townshend said in ""Rolling Stone"" when it was pointed out to him that he had been friendly with a lot of English aristocrats, ""Aristocrats are supposed to be real sh**s. But I don't think I met even one who was a real sh**. Whereas, in the music business, I could introduce you to a THOUSAND sh**s! "" This book is a good study of those types."
5,Glad I Bought This For Class &#65533; Very Useful,"I bought this book for a course I'm taking about the music business and after reading it, I'm so glad I did. It's an easy read since it's broken into several chapters...each about a particular musician or group. The chapters tell the story of a legal battle or a deal gone terribly wrong. It illustrates the pitfalls that lay before artists when it comes to publicity, trademarks, estate planning, merchandising, copyright infringement, royalty claims, publishing, bankruptcy, and so much more. I particularly enjoyed the stories about Elvis Presley, Billy Joel, The Beatles, and Judas Priest. A terrific addition to your personal library."
2,lacking,"this program did not have the full converago of my computer safe. The firewall would always pop onto my screen when i went to a new set of web sites, so that meant that I was always pressing the X button on that program. I also upgraded my computer which meant that McCafee was never loaded back on because I didn't want to have to deal with the program again. I would prefer Norton System works over McCafee any day and that is what I now have back on my computer and I am very satisfied with its performance."
1,Horrendous and Outdated,"This book is the most outdated piece of garbage out there. I was forced to purchase it for an Anthropology course at UMASS Boston, and has verified that education in this country is a joke. Written in 1992, about 18 years ago. A lot has happened since 1992, like I'm not 9 anymore and I'm 27. How could this book even be sold still.There are racist, homophobic overtones, nothing is relevant, it is written from an ethnocentric view.Seriously do not buy this pointless waste of money, waste of time, useless, outdated, irrelevant book.If you have to, rent it and return it asap as to get it out of your possession so you won't become dumber, or at least so you don't fool yourself into thinking it is 1992 again."
4,Fusion Pop,"One of the aspects of Cafe Tacuba's music that makes it so great is ithe love it has for fusing musical styles. Even though it is fusion, the bottom line is that Cafe Tacuba makes pop music. Joselo's solo album shows us why that is. He is the heart of cafe tacuba's music,the guy that connects all the different genres of music back to the pop world. This album is just pure unadulturated pop: quiet,sweet,sad,happy,short, and always very simple. Listening to this album makes me feel happy, and reminds me of being a child. Joselo shows that even though the apple doesnt fall far from the tree, the apple can appeal to different sensations of the mind and soul."
5,"Joselo, sounds like the father of SINO","If you are fan of Cafe Tacvba (Tacuba), and want to know the evolution of the band, this is a obligate item you need to have."
3,martinu quartets,Please know that these recordings are also available in a Brilliant Box which also includes the quartets of Janacek and Smetana. The sound is excellent and the Stamitz Quartet is excellent on all. The box is labeled Czech Masters and the price much cheaper.
3,Works like other brands,"Works as effective as other brands. If you're familiar with B2, you know this can stain your hands yellow/orange. Wash immediately afterwards.Buying this product makes your hands and urine more yellow/orange than other brands though."
3,riboflavin,When I was encouraged to take riboflavin for migraines I was hoping I could get a bigger dosage because I have to take 400 mg per day. The pills are a bit large to swallow but they seem to be working for me.
5,Useful adjunct for migraine,"One of a handful of migraine preventatives in my mix. I take 400 mg per day, as per published clinical trials. By itself, it is supposed to reduce migraine frequency in half; but since I have daily migraines if they are untreated, getting to every other day isn't good enough. It is best value, least amount of potentially allergenic additives for the money, as of January 2013."
2,Hard to Swallow,"This product arrived on time and as stated, but I found the capsules hard to swallow. I am one who usually can take several pills at a time and found even one at a time with these capsules seemed difficult. The capsules kind of stick and didn't go down easily."
3,???,"makes your pee really yellow. It is as described, but I'm not sure that its working. I guess my body has enough of this vitamin."
4,Good quality at a very reasonable price,"Nature Way's B2 capsules are a good product. The ingredients are decent and the vitamins are sold at an excellent price.Juts one note: The capsules are not small. They are gelatin and fairly easy to swallow. However, if you have trouble swallowing pills or just prefer a smalled capsule to swallow you may want to shop around. For example, TwinLab makes a very good B2 capsule for a little more, yet the capsulres are much smaller, far less than half the szie of the Nature's Way capsule.Other than the size, the Nature's Way product is very good, and very, very reasonbly priced."
5,Hard to find item,This was recommended by my neurologist to take to prevent migraines. No store locally had it in stock. Glad to find it on Amazon at such a low price. Will be buying again in the future.
2,Maybe it's just me...,"... but one of the straps on the underside of the watch sticks out all the time and no matter how much I tuck it back, it sticks right back out. It's gotten to the point where I just don't wear it anymore (I wanted this to be my casual watch - the only leather band I have - but it is too annoying). I have very small wrists, so perhaps that's why I'm having this problem. But since the straps are designed this way (there are two layers of straps, one thick and one thin), it may happen to others."
1,Shame on Amazon,"It was not the original soundtrack from the movie with all the great songsand artists. I should have read the other reviews before I made this purchase.I was very, very, disappointed."
3,Careful -Score VS Soundtrack,"When I first listened to this CD I was very disapointed, expecting it to be the sound track. I was REALLY looking forward to listening to Brook Benton and Norah Jones and others. I now realize I've purchased the Score. After getting over my attitude attack, and listening to the SCORE, it's very good. Nice background music for work, or tinkering in the kitchen. Light Jazz. I am now REALLY enjoying this CD! PS ( When I first attempted to purchase this CD and found out it wouldn't be released till last Jan, I HAD to hear Brook Benton and Norah Jones, so I bought ""Norah Jones - Come Away With Me"" and ""Brook Benton - Endlessly"" WOW and WOW, I Love these two CD's. GET THEM!"
4,great SCORE,"Im just utterly disapointed at all the people that knocked this absolutly wonderful effort by John Powell JUST because they were expecting songs. COME ON, this score deserves more than that.As for the Score itself, John Powell again is up to his usual self with some catchy and wonderful string work. As a score, this is 4 stars, and deserves the credit, which some ignorant people refuse to give it."
3,Missing Tunes,Unfortuanelty this CD only covers the score. But if someone is looking for the same great tune that I liked so much. It is a Joni Mitchel song called Big Yellow Taxi covered by Couting Crows feat. Vanessa Carlton. Enjoy! FDT
1,"""Two Weeks Notice""","I thought the movie ""Two Weeks' Notice"" was mediocre, but the music was fabulous. Like a lot of other people, I went on Amazon to buy it. Lucky for me that you provide the wonderful reviews so that I immediately KNEW it was not the music of various artists that made the movie what it was, but rather ""boring do-de-do background stuff"". Thanks for the warning!"
4,Take notice of this pretty score,"First of all, for those looking for a list of songs in the movie, here are some.Norah Jones - The Nearness of YouDusty Springfield - The Look of Love (might be the cover by Diana Krall )Counting Crows w/ Vanessa Carlton - Big Yellow TaxiBachman Turner Overdrive - Taking Care Of BusinessAretha Franklin - RESPECTSinatra - Come Fly with MeSecond, this is a sweet and charming movie and the score only highlights it. One of the best pieces is ""Love Theme"" which adds the perfect backdrop to the movie.My advice is that if it says SCORE, for future reference, it will be the score."
1,Disappointed!,"I was very disappointed to see that there are no songs that are featured in the movie on this CD. I would like to see a CD brought out that includes the great cover of ""Big Yellow Taxi"" by the Counting Crows w/ Vanessa Carlton. If you like scores, this is for you. If not...forget it!"
1,A Complete Letdown,"As other people here have mentioned here, this is the musical score to the movie as opposed to the actual songs you hear. First off - this is a terrible way to market the CD as many people will buy it expecting something else.The seconds HUGE mistake with this is that if you want to get a CD with the actual songs from the movie (NOT the score) then you have to download them and burn them (boo!). This may not sound bad but the songs are in Windows Media Format (yuck) and are encoded in 128kbps (your not getting CLOSE to CD Quality till you get to 192kps or better). I have no idea what marketing deparment dreamed up this fiasco.I'm hoping that it will be availible on CD soon - since I *really* would like a nice sounding version of Big Yellow Taxi by Counting Crows feat. Vanessa Carlton (the version on the Crows CD doesnt have Vanessa in it)"
2,THIS IS A SCORE NOT THE SONGS FROM THE MOVIE,I did not read the CD. I just bought it. It is the score from the movie. The songs in the movie brought back great memories BUT they are not on the CD.
3,Pressplay,"Many thanks to the music fan from VA but, unfortunately, Pressplay is not yet available outside of the US! Good planning on the part of the Movie Producers!!"
3,"Not the Songs From the Movie, But Still Decent","The main thing that made the movie Two Weeks Notice so good was the music. Specifically, the songs done by various and sundry artists. You would expect that the music on a CD bearing the movie's name would be those songs. If so, you would be wrong. This is a CD of the background music that was played when a song was not running.The background music, on whole, is pretty decent in its own right. As such, this CD is still worth the cost."
1,Not what I expected,I was looking forward to hearing the songs from the movie and instead I hear a collection of all the instrumentals from the movie. Too bad because I really enjoyed the songs on the movie.
1,Very disappointed,"None of the great songs in the film is on this, it's just the score. I'm sorry I bought it."
1,This is very bad!,"I was expecting to hear the songs from the movie, because I remembered that I really liked them.Let me tell you I am so mad, I wasted 20$ for nothing..."
4,Disappointed but beautiful nonetheless,"I am with all of the reviews I have now read after buying this. This was my first CD purchase online, and made the assumption this was the Sountrack - of which after watching the movie was totally looking forward to getting the soundtrack, so rather than waiting for it in stores (which I looked first) I ordered. I didn't find the song names when ordering -- So now I know the difference between ""score"" and ""soundtrack"" -- However, though I don't listen to this as regularly as I would the soundtrack, it is fabulous and beautiful music. -- I hope they release the ""soundtrack"" eventually - the sooner the better!!!"
1,SOUNDTRACK not the score,"I too am looking all over the place for the list of songs played during the movie, and they are nowhere to be found, but the original score. I would like very much to find this list of songs.What they offer here as the Soundtrack is not what we are all looking for.Shame !!"
4,Disapointed - but still nice,"My husband ordered what he thought was the soundtrack after I told him how great the songs were. I was so happy and could hardly wait to hear it on my hour drive in to work. I realized my spouse had purchased the movie score as soon as it started to play. However, after a hectic morning preparing for work, I thoroughly enjoyed the CD after all. I followed up by going on line to purchase the soundtrack after watching the movie again but I see that it is unavailable. I wish it was because it is a great soundtrack - but the movie score is really quite good."
1,Disappointed,"I just watched the dvd of this movie - and loved the movie - and the music! I was excited to find the soundtrack - but then after looking at the song titles, I did not order it. Where is the soundtrack of all the great music that was in the movie?"
1,Two Weeks Notice,What an unfair way to market a CD. People who buy the Soundtrack would assume that they would get the music that was in the movie - but nooooo. The CD consists of harp music that would be nice in an elevator but not in my collection.
1,Deception!,"I basically bought this CD because I wanted to hear the Counting Crows rendition of Big Yellow Taxi. This ""score"" was one big disappointment. Wish I'd read the reviews first. Any one know where I can find the song I'm looking for?"
4,Not what I expected but good music anyway,"This is Not what I expected, however this is a good C.D. The Score From the Movie is a pretty good Score. you are all Complaining because it's not the the Soundtrack Soundtrack, but a lot of good movies Don't always put out the Soundtrack soundtrack. By the way whoever said you can download the music from the movies' website was seriously mistaken I have been on. The Website and can't find a thing about Downloading the music from it. Also Whoever wrote the complaint to Universal Studio's Wrote there complaint to the wrong Movie Production Company they need to write it to warner Bros. Who actually put out the movie, or to Castlerock Entertainment who was also intrumental in putting out this Movie."
1,Two Weeks Notice - soundtrack,"Like many of you, I too am disappointed that all of those lovely classic songs, that were played during the movie, are no where to be found on the soundtrack, so I emailed Universal Studios at UniversalStudios.com and clicked on 'contact us' then clicked on the 'music' category and asked them if they are considering putting out a second soundtrack to this lovely romantic comedy that includes all of those wonderful classic songs. May I suggest that all of you who have been disenchanted with this soundtrack, do the same? Maybe if Universal receives enough emails requesting this, we will get the soundtrack they should have put out in the first place."
1,Extremely disappointed.,"After I watched Two Weeks Notice, I was really looking forward to buying the soundtrack because I had heard so many great songs in the movie. When I went to the record store and saw the tracklisting, I was appalled. There was not one song on the soundtrack, just the score! I wouldn't have even hesitated buying this album if they would have included songs from the movie, like ""Big Yellow Taxi,"" ""Magic Moments,"" ""Respect,"" ""Papa's Got A Brand New Bag,"" ""The Nearness of You,"" ""Come Fly With Me"" and ""The Look of Love.""This could have been a wonderful soundtrack. Unfortunately, it's not."
1,Not What People Wanted,"Most people who bought this album were duped! They thought they were buying the Sountrack to Two Weeks Notice when in fact, they were buying the Score to the movie. No one wants the Score...Where is the Soundtrack???????????????"
1,NOT THE MUSIC THAT WAS IN THE MOVIE-HATED IT!,"THIS CD WAS SO DISAPPOINTING. HAD THE COMPANY STUCK WITH THE CONTEMPORARY MUSIC, STEVE WINWOOD, AL GREEN, ETC. THE SOUNDTRACK WOULD HAVE BEEN SPECTACULAR. BUT THIS AGAIN IS WHAT IS NECESSARILY WHAT YOU SEE IS NOT WHAT YOU GET. WHAT A LET-DOWN! I WANT MY MONEY BACK!"
2,Found the SOUNDTRACK!!!,"I've also been searching for the soundtrack (not the score). On the back of the DVD, it says ""Soundtrack available on pressplay"". Sure enough, at pressplay.com, you can download the entire sountrack as an album!!! It's worth it!"
1,Disappointed,"Do not get this expecting it to be a collection of songs from the movie. It is the instrumental backround music, not the featured songs."
2,Not the movie's soundtrack,"We were truly disappointed when we got this CD, expecting to hear all the great songs from the movie.....but not, we only got the score. It will be really nice if they come up with the real soundtrack sometime."
1,[Not worth it],"When my daughter asked what I wanted for my birthday, I picked this cd because we had seen the movie together at Chrismas when I was visiting, and I enjoyed the soundtrack so much I wanted to share the experience again. What a surprise when listening to it for the first time, I thought I had a promo that a songwriter was selling and I knew my daughter [would be disappointed]. The soundtrack is not even available: the cd is packaged the stars as though it is the definitive track. No wonder the music industry is losing profits because the public is burning cd's. They expect a fair and honest price for the products they buy. This transaction just made two people disappointed with the merchant and of course, we cannot send the product back because I listened to it once. ..."
3,A Pleasant Score Album,"In reading the reviews for this particular score, I was surprised by how many people gave the score such a low rating simply because the cd contained the film score, not the film's songs. One thing that must be understood is that you shouldn't criticize a score simply because certain songs aren't there, the cd should be judged on what's actually there... and the honest truth is, what's actually there is rather pleasant. John Powell has pieced together a very listenable and pleasant background album, mostly light jazz bits with a slightly romantic touch. No, it's not a sweeping, breathtaking score that will thrill you, but it's a very nice little album that makes a good candidate for something to listen to while you cook dinner or relax on the porch. if you're seeking the film's songs, avoid it, but, if you are a film score fan and can appreciate a good romantic comedy score, this is one you might consider picking up."
1,Not what I thought,"Was very dissappointed that this was not the ""soundtrack"" of various great music from the movie....but was the ""score"". Since when do they not put out a typical soundtrack? Sorry I wasted my money. Will they put out a regular soundtrack??"
1,Where's the GOOD music?,I love to collect soundtracks but this one's a big disappointment. Thanks to the review from Colorado I didn't waste my money on this score. Someone should put together the REAL soundtrack. I'd buy!
1,what a waste,"I agree with all the other reviews. I was hoping for the songs from the movie, not the background music."
1,Soundtrack stinks - Movie is a riot,"When my wife brought this movie home I instantly labeled it asone of her ""Foo Foo"" movies. I watched it (against my will) andfound the movie to be very funny. I rate the movie and the actual soundtrack as 5 stars.Unfortunately, the movie soundtrack CD is obviously self centered around John Powell the movie's Composer. My suggestion to Mr. Powell is to publish a CD on his own. Then, publish another CD with all the music from the movie (Norah Jones, etc). In closing and for those wanting the bare facts....this CD Soundtrack [is not good], we use it as a coaster."
1,Where are the songs from the movie?,"I haven't heard this CD as I have not been able to find it in any of my music stores yet. But, after seeing the movie I was waiting anxiously for this CD to come out. After reviewing the songs listed I am wondering.... Where are the actual songs that were in this movie? Unless I know that ""Taking Care of Business"", ""The Look of Love"", and finally a song (title unknown to me) by Norah Roberts are all on this CD it is not a true ""soundtrack""."
3,It works like I expected it to.,It works like I expected it to. My only complaint is that I would've liked something to make it more compatable with a smaller guage crossbar like the one on my motorcycle.Jerry-rigging it to compensenate for this was easy though.
2,Overly questions unanswered,"This book has three stories that doesn't have to do one with another. The standoff is thrilling and would had been a great story if it'd be a little longer. The flashback is sometimes boring and sometimes just fine. Its overly long and in the core it doesn't has to do anything with the main story.Lena's love story is pathetic. Why? Because she knew what means what it's suffering with a man. This you can read it in 'Blindsighted'. So if she saw that his boyfriend beat her when he is in a mood, and she wanted to leave him why did she return to get beaten again? If she's a cop why she left his boyfriend beat her? She was really pregnant? As you see here we have overly questions unanswered. That's not the way to write a book."
5,Indelible,You will sit on the edge of seat for this and any other book Karen writes. I love all her books especially the Linton and Toliver series.
4,Back and forth,In the book slaughter goes back and forth between present and past. She does it nicely so that it is clear but y want all the information quickly because it is a gripping tale that spans years.
4,What a good book,This is the first book I have read by Karin Slaughter & I must say it was a really good book. I look forward to reading more from her.
1,CHAOTIC NOT COMPLEX,A disappointing attempt to provide a novel explanation for a lethal hostage situation. This book lacks the focus and substance of Slaughter's previous efforts.
5,LOVED IT,Love everything written by this author. She keeps your attention from start to finish. Characters are always easy to relate to and very believable.
3,Weaker than her previous novels.,I have to admit that I was slightly disappointed by this bookas I loved her previous works. It still contains all the trademark elements of earlier books but with the flashbacks in this one it did at times make it somewhat of a muddled tale.
5,Indelible,These characters are all too human and the plot is well developed. I feel like I know all involved intametly.
5,"Just the right mix of intriguing plot, believable characters and forensics!","I wasn't sure I'd like the 'flashbacks' as Slaughter combined two stories into one, but she did this really well and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.The main story is actually the 'flashback' but she cleverly combines the past and present as we learn about Jeffreys history and the beginning of his and Sara's relationship as well as discover the truth behind two earlier deaths.Not boringly descriptive yet I could well imagine Sylacauga in Alabama and the characters who lived there.The author really describes her characters and the feelings behind their actions well."
4,Great Next Book in the Series,"If you've been with Ms. Slaughter since Blindsighted, you won't be disappointed by her latest book in the series. I enjoyed it tremendously and count it as the best in the series. I won't rehash the plot(s) as you can read other reviews, but I couldn't put it down until I had turned the last page.Some nay sayers who read this as their first book in the series seem disappointed - I say start with Blindsighted and move forward. You won't regret it!"
5,Better then the others,"I gave this book 5 stars because I thought it was the best of the four by Ms Slaughter. I finally saw some resolution in the main characters' relationship and it was about time, too. The overall story was much more interesting, going back and forth between now and the past. I hope the next book brings resolution to another character, Lena. She needs to move on. Very good, fast-paced book."
1,TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!,"I have read most of Slaughter's books. I recently discovered her, and have enjoyed her suspenseful stories.This book, however, has a flashback from 10 (?) years prior to current story. The current story is chaptered in days and increments of time, as most of her books are. In the beginning of this whole hostage story, starts a flashback that either is a chapter at a time, or multiple chapters. I got so distracted, and bored, with the flashback, I couldn't help but wonder what this had to do with the story. It over powers the intial story. I could care less about the flashback story, that went on and on. I wanted to read about the current standoff. This was a terrible book. Definitely not recommended."
3,It's Ok,"The album is ok for fans of JMann's projects but there are only like a couple songs on the album that I would want to listen to many times over, for the most part it feels repetitive and it was a bit dull. I also didn't like how the songs were really short."
3,To Short,"This is not a bad album...however it is also nothing that will impress. SOC puts together some good tunes with a straight up metal beat. Nothing to fancy in terms of singing, guitar work, or drumming. It's good music to just bang your head to, or workout to.My main gripe with the album was how short the songs were. Most of the songs are 2:50 in length or less. By the time you start to get into a song, it's pretty much over."
1,@#$%%^&!!!!!!,"I bought this to replace a screechy tape that was defective when rec'd.Well surprise, this one was defective in the same way (from two different vendors) this tells me that all of these are defective from the factory, and the vendors don't screen what they are selling."
2,Poor Imitation,Purchased this thinking it was reprint of a book from the 60s. Same title and same premise and great stories.I was greatly disappointed. This collection is no where as good as the stories from the older book.I am still searching for that older book and highly recommend it over this one.
3,Leaning Swedish in Song,This cassette and book is good for children who wish to learn Swedish in melody. [songs]. Not for adults.
5,"A superb, professional-quality, industry-standard reference","Now in its 53rd updated edition, 2005 National Construction Estimator is a no-nonsence resource designed expressly to aid in estimating labor and material costs, manhours, and city cost adjustments for residential, commercial, and industrial construction. 2005 National Construction Estimator consists almost entirely of tables listing prices for each piece of hardware (or manhours); an index allows for swift lookup of individual components.

5,One of the best devotional books that I have ever read.,"This book was given to me as a 21st Birthday gift by my preacher and good friend. I have enjoyed reading and studying God's word from it every night since I recieved the book. I would definitely reccommend this book to anyone who is looking for a good spiritually sound book to read. Like I said earlier, it is definitely one of the best I have ever read!"
5,native,Eduardo is an awesome person. I saw him speak in person. He is very good at helping to put the audience in the right 'space' in regard to working with/understanding Native people.
1,Leaky hose,"This 6 foot extender hose is cheaply made and leaks when you attach it to other hoses. I tried attaching this hose to 3 different hoses/sprayers and every time it leaked. The threaded (male) end would not screw in all the way and remained loose, and thus leaky when the water was turned on. I had no such problems with any of my existing hoses and sprayers, so clearly I got a defective hose.Beware: this hose is low-quality."
3,Hose is Good but...,"I bought one of these after Mrs. Spudman asked me to move the garden hose that was interfering with the foundation bed's aesthetics. The plan was to put the stake and faucet in front of a large evergreen since it's a pain to reach the on house connection hidden by shrubbery.Hooking up the hose itself was fine especially with the included washers and nice connectors. The spike and faucet, however, weren't as cooperative. I didn't like the plastic spike and plastic connections and couldn't get a tight fit using it. The faucet knob felt flimsy and didn't inspire me with conficence. I finally ditched the spike/faucet and just used the six foot hose to complete my little project. To turn the hose on and off in a convenient location I am using a metal faucet bought at the local hardware store. It works great."
5,Love it!,"Showcases Gold City in a unique way.The inserts are Tim Riley's personal accounts of the songs on the CD, what they meant to him, how they came to sing that song and stuff like that. Very interesting.The songs selected were great choices and deserved to be on a ""Bests"" album.*God's Building a Church - Shows off TIm's low bass voice!*I'm Not Giving Up - No matter what, hang in there! One of Gold City's all-time favorite hits.*Child of the Light - I belong to God and there's no doubt! Features a great story along with it.An outstanding job and a good addition to any Southern Gospel fan's collection."
5,American Made,Well made solid wood cover plates that look great in our home and best of all their American made! Would be nice to see more American made product.
2,Roasted Chestnuts but no taste,Roasted Chestnuts are a tradition with my family on Christmas day but this purchase of chestnuts was very disappointing due to the lack of flavor of the chestnuts themselves...no flavor even with using my chestnut roaster. The texture was perfect as well as the color but lacked taste in the mouth. Thank you.
1,Terrible,We ordered two jars of these cooked and peeled chestnuts. The vacuum was opened on one bottle and we tossed it out. The seal on the second jar was OK but the chestnuts were mealy. We tossed it out.I think we should get our charges refunded.
1,The are much better options,"Unfortunately, this book is so poorly written that it is often confusing. Especially for a beginner, I highly recommend obtaining a copy of Pilone's book instead. The examples are much clearer and easier to follow, and the exposition is extremely clear."
4,Good Overview,"Although this book won't make you a guru in one pass, it is a good introduction--more concise than the comicky ""Head First"" O'Reilly books and more complete/faster paced than the Dummies books, but less deep than some other series. There is a great organizing theme throughout, based on the type of view that one wants to focus on--logical, physical, process, development, or use case. Well written with useful examples, it lives up to its O'Reilly animal-cover heritage."
5,Pragmatic UML,"I found the presentation pragmatic, readable, and practical.It is easy to pick a UML Diagram type you want to use and start reading, drawing.UML is a straight forward notation and these authors presents it as such. (Perhaps because it is straight forward many other authors seem to make their UML exposition much more complex than it needs to be)."
5,UML 2.0,The manual was delivered quickly and in good condition. I was very satisfied. The content of the manual is enabling me to build on a critical business analysis skill.
3,Good and Handy,"Nice to read and quick to understand with the illustrations. Well described examples and after going through the frist few models you would able to quick start building the models. Overall, It is recommended for a one time read."
3,"Great spiritual, fath-based book of reflection","Fran Yates has written a book for the ages. It is an awesome account of a young girl growing up facing, meeting and resolving many adversities. She was the product of a mother with numerous problems, was brought by God to Mrs. Carrie and her husband Mack who raised her like a daughter. Mrs. Carrie is a person we should all have in our lives but Linda was the lucky one. A wonderful, quick read that will cause both tears and laughter and bring upon you personal reflection of the Holy Spirit working in all our lives everyday."
2,Very disappointing,"Comprehensively defanged version of the Ursula LeGuin Scifi classic (her 2nd best novel after the (as yet unfilmed) Left Hand of Darkness), this DVD omits so many plot elements it is barely possible to follow it without having read the book, and if you've read the book, you won't want to.Extra star because it *looks* good, especially the hot young leads, and James Caan and David Strathairn are always watchable. But the up to date special effects treatment of the aliens that many fans were waiting for is absent - in fact, there are no aliens! Plenty else missing, in particular a sense of pacing and excitement somehow got left on the cutting floor.Correctly described by pipingbear as the ""Latte of Heaven"", sweet as far as it goes, but insubstantial, unsatisfying - and produced by a vast evil conglomerate!"
1,Vile,"The 1980 version is lovely--low budget but true to the book and Le Guin's vision. This clunker is hardly recognizable as the same story. Le Guin says she had nothing to do with it, and it shows. Don't waste your time on this version; get the 1980 instead."
1,Lathe of Heaven - 2002,"The only way this type of butchered travisty will not happen again is to vote with your dollars. This remake, which aired on A&E;, is one of the worst efforts I have seen in a long time.Get the original PBS version, also available on Amazon, if you want to get the feel of the real story, or buy the book. Sometimes failure is important to learn to be better and to stop under-estimating the audience. This 2002 production has a lot to teach about failure. Unfortunately, for those of us who know the original production and book, it's an unnecessary lesson that is unbearable to watch."
5,A Personal Favorite,"For once I must disagree with some of Amazon's top reviewers (a rare occasion). This version of ""The Lathe of Heaven"" stands alone from the book (you don't need to read the book to understand the movie). The characters and plot are deep and moving. Due to the depth and development of the mood it is slow at times, but it never becomes dull. It is original, refreshing and a touching love story runs as an uplifiting undercurrent. Even those who don't like Science Fiction, or don't ""get"" the book will enjoy this film."
1,"Saw the A&E remake, skip it","It really missed the mark and I was very disappointed and that's a shame because I so looked foreward to it. The serious problem was that they seemed to miss the idea of the book (LeGuin did not consult on the production) and made Dr Haber a power hungry guy which is true but in the book, despite his becomining more powerful and bigger, he does want to create a better world. Lisa Bonet is really not mature enough as an actress to play Heather Lalashe, I'm sorry she just can't pull it off. Plot wise, they skipped what a good 2/3 of the book! I really think they should have had a few of the changed worlds, they totally missed the plague that wiped out 5 billion people, the dropped the aliens, everyone turning gray. THe whole concept that if you change one thing everything changes. Get the 1980 PBS version, much better, more fun. Though, I did like Manny in this version, I have to admit. But they aliens never exist so he nevetr gets called Jor Jor (George Orr)....."
1,A pale immitation,This remake of the Ursula K. Le Guin's classic will be a sad disappointment to fans of the 1979 adaptation starring Bruce Davison.
3,poor visual quality,"Other reviewers have put this film through the thresher, but I wished to add a couple of points:1) Lukas Haas's understated performance is perfect for the character; anyone in that position would have learned to be subdued, or else. Most of the other actors follow suit, which makes for a smarter film.2) This DVD is a great example of why WIDESCREEN is not the same as ANAMORPHIC. This widescreen disc shows up both letter-boxed and pillar-boxed. If you zoom in on the central image, definition collapses to something like standard def (awful). Hardly a great film, but an enjoyable enough experience if you take it on its own terms, and deserving of a better DVD than this dreadful thing."
1,NOT THE ORIGINAL!!!,"This is a recent version of the ""Lathe of Heaven"", not thePBS version from the early 80's. While the first version wasa wonderfully crafted adaptaion of the original story, thisis a maudline love story that never rises above the mundane.I saw a special preview of this movie at the recent WorldSF convention. I went to see it thinking it was the same""Lathe of Heaven"" that I had seen on PBS 20 years ago. A movieso powerful that although I saw it only the once I still rememberit well. I was thrilled at the chance to see it again. I wasso very disappointed.Nothing about this is worth watching. Buy the 1980 versioninstead."
1,Skip it.,"I had high expectations for this movie. A decent budget, modern effects and real actors. I really liked the original Lathe PBS movie, but it had that low budget feel. The story, not the effects carried it, something that is impossible to find today. Having seen that original adaptation and read the book, I was left wondering. Did the person who made this screenplay read the book? Perhaps he started reading Lathe and fell asleep watching Quantum Leap. I really don't know, nor do I care. This movie is a dog.It was painful to watch, poorly acted and bizarre in the extreme. Maybe it's what Lathe would be if you read the book while drunk and had a short term memory problem."
1,Horrible...,"One of the worst remakes I've ever seen. The original PBS movie is the one you want to see - a true classic. This version ignored most of the important plot lines of the original book, and left me angry and frustrated. I watched the original movie (made in 1980 for a fraction of the cost) just to wash the bad taste out of my mouth. Please - don't waste your time or money on this travesty."
4,"Good, but...","I think Al Roker is the greatest. His book was both informative and funny. However, after he details his trials and tribulations of becoming a father, the book gets choppy. He doesn't tie the chapters together too well. Over all though it was a very good read that I couldn't put down"
2,Stick With Your Day Job,"Al Roker is a funny, humble, insightful, multi-perspective weatherman. The audio CD falls short in all ways compared with expectations. The ""getting pregnant"" section may have been personally important to Al's family, but the story was told without humor, insight or depth. The audio delivery was weak, almost flattened like a pancake.For my next road trip, I'll try a novel, a history of the English language or a sports biography - anything but humor or parenting tips from the weatherman."
1,I am disappointed!,"Frankly, I am disappointed. I thought this book would be humor filled. I guess I was hoping for another like ""Bill Cosby: Himself"". This was not to be.All the other reviews are excellent, but I cannot recommend this one. Where he tried to be funny about his wife and things they went through, I thought instead he was being utterly RUDE toward and about his wife. He even criticizes his wife when he asked her to look over and critique his manuscript and she left her opinion for him. Why ask her opinion if he is just going to throw her suggestions back into her face?I do not recommend this book to anyone and that is a rare thing for me to do."
1,YUCK!,"Frankly, I am disappointed. I thought this book would be humor filled. I guess I was hoping for another like ""Bill Cosby: Himself"". This was not to be.All the other reviews are excellent, but I cannot recommend this one. Where he tried to be funny about his wife and things they went through, I thought instead he was being utterly RUDE toward and about his wife. He even criticizes his wife when he asked her to look over and critique his manuscript and she left her opinion for him. Why ask her opinion if he is just going to throw her suggestions back into her face?I do not recommend this book to anyone and that is a rare thing for me to do."
2,"Easy read, somewhat entertaining","Received as a Father's Day gift. Al Roker's: Don't Make Me Stop This Car, is an easy read but left me a bit less than entertained.More like a collection of essays rather than a narrative, the book cointains Al's personal, although a bit shallow, experiences in pregnancy, adoption and artificial insemination (yes, you read correctly).While there are a handful of funny parts in the book, they are few and far between. Two other books that I have heard Al's book being compared to are: Babyhood and Couplehood by Paul Reiser. Well, in my humble opinion, both of Reiser's book are astoundingly better than Al's book. (Sorry Al!)"
1,don't make me stop this car,This is the worst book I have ever read! My advise to Al is: Don't give up your day job!
1,Let me out of this car,"Terrible! Al Roker should be ashamed of this. I got the book as a gift, for Father's Day. Very Disappointing. Who cares if Al has sperm motility problems? His snide description of his ""little guys"" was repulsive! The title promised so much, but we got so little. I read 20 pages, 10 too many. Waste of time and money. Don't buy or even borrow it from the library."
2,AL ROKER...A NON ROKKER,"This is an autobiography as related to the author's two children. He doesn't delve into any other area of his life except about a few comments of his TV career.Al's sincerity comes through, shining, but this book is meant for the first time parent at a youthful age. There is not a whole lot of information to pay attention to, but this is just a simple story of how one man looks at his status of fatherhood."
3,Don't Make Me Diss This Book!,"Wow, I am so torn. Al Roker has long been a morning staple for me, and his upbeat personality is an inspiration, but i just don't know about this book. He gets an ""E"" for effort, that's for sure. There are some truly candid moments, but it does drag on after a while. I guess if you're expecting a non-stop laugh fest, you might want to look elsewhere."
5,VERY INSPIRING,"As always, Dyer and Chopra are very inspiring and give you much to think about, even in one short tape. The person writing another review wants a ""how to"", but in one tape, that's impossible. Plus, spiritual matters are less about ""how to"" than easing the psyche into a fuller life."
1,Disappointing,"Save your money on this one. They ALWAYS seem to skirt the issue as to HOW right now. I'd recommend getting Personal Power II by Anthony Robbins - they both teach relatively the same work, but with diff. words - semantics some would say."
3,"Spacey, psychy, somewhat goofy quasi-electronic","This is a set of very quirky and playful songs in a space-rock meets electronic music vein by an SF band. One of the members used to be in Melting Euphoria, and it has some of the stylistics of their first album. It's not the best album ever, but it's fun and interesting if you like unusual tapes, loops, poetry, and just odd electronic goofery."
1,This Is Not Music!,"Well folks, it's like this. There is a lot of very good music out there today, but this is not it. This is simply someone splicing together a bunch of electronic noises and calling it music. Any three year old using a Fisher Price toy could make these sounds. Am I being harsh, yes, but honest too. This (music???) has no structure, no sense, no melody, no point."
1,Uhhh...No,"Once apon a time, I was into alternative, and even then I didn't like this cd. ""Bulletproof"" was the only song I like.I won't say these guys suck...But the sound like every other post Nirvana group. Nothing new here"
1,"Stop with the R Rated versions and release the Unrated Versions, Please!","I saw this movie on Showtime, which was longer than the DVD. The sex scenes on T.V. were longer and far better than what was on video. Susan Featherly is one of the hottest ladies in the soft core genre. Her last love scene, when taking it from behind and the moans she makes are very arousing. Like most of my searches for these types of movies, sometimes you have to track down VHS,or even a region 2 DVD. Then you must also get an all region/or region 2 player. If the XXX industry is said to be thriving, the producers of the softcore genre could increase the business success by releasing the unrated cuts of these films."
5,susan's attraction is desirable.,"Another hot exotic movie of susan featherly that is very entertaining to watch. You just never get bored watching her deadly moves and her sexy style. I recommend this movie to all my friends and give it a two thumbs up. Keep driving the guys crazy Susan, YOU SIZZLE!!!"
4,i like it,"i am 68 and have never used a yoga tape or book ,I can do most, maybe not hold quite as long -but i find them relaxing and metatative . I think older peo;le may find this advantages. susan"
2,More selling than demonstrating yoga,"I wish I could have returned this DVD but your policy is they cannot be opened which does not give you a chance to view it and not be stuck with it.This DVD spent 10 minutes selling the program. I thought there would be more yoga instruction, their life story is interesting but I think it could be cut and show more demonstration. Since I have to keep it, I will skip what I don't want to watch and view the portions of interest to me."
2,Not as implied,Cameras have narrow view. Camera 1 (channel 1) is the most powerful with camera 4 (channel 4) only functioning within 10 feet of receiver. IR night view is provided by LEDs which only weakly illuminate a 4 foot circle up to about 15 feet. To monitor an area in the dark or near dark it does not do the job.
3,it's Ok. I expected more from Hartmann,"Feels cheap. It works find and has a good design, but it is not up to the quality I would expect from Hartmann."
1,Not so much.,"This is a great price for this battery, but it won't hold a charge very long. It serves as an emergency backup for the ""real"" battery, but only until the name-brand battery can get charged. Wouldn't buy again."
4,My new Toy,"I have been running my tumbler full time for a month. Had one problem right at first due to the clips on the idler shaft being being not pressed onto the shaft far enough which allowed the first barrel to move over and contact the pulling wearing the barrel base and causing the motor to overheat and shutdown, (a great feature), by the way. The tumbler otherwise seems to work great. I find a competitive machine at Harbor freight for a bit less money, but felt this one an OK deal.A tumbler can be a great geology instructional tool if someone explains the various stones, their types and origins. A beach, like where I take the dog to romp, can be a whole school on geomorphology."
3,Rock Tumbler,"My 9 year old son loves collecting rocks. We thought it would be fun for him to be able to turn his findings into treasures. We did not consider the length of time this would take and we were not prepared for the amount of noise put out by tumbling rocks in the cylinders. The machine was quickly moved to the basement where it was forgotten about. This is designed for older, more patient children and/or adults."
4,Great pan but watch for rust.,"As far as non-sticks go this is THE best loaf pan- the coating amazingly does not flake off. I will never buy anything Wilton's again because their non-stick is horrid and you will likely end up eating it- Norpro, on the other hand, knows what they are doing. This pan rusted for me after just 2 years in the corners and bottom holes. If you live in a humid climate or do not completely dry the pan it WILL rust. Still gets four stars because I'm sure I'm partly to blame for the rust issue."
4,Great meatlof pan,This is a very handy pan when making meatloaf. The fat gets drained although some are still left at the top and you just have to spoon it off. Good price and I highly recommend it!
4,Its a nice pan,I am giving this pan a 4 star/5 star because as it is a nice pan its more width than depth... they sell nicer/deeper pans at the fry's grocery store for 12 bucks.. ill be buying one there next time..
5,good,Love this pan. You can cook almost anything in it and the grease or water drains right into the bottom of the pan.
1,not happy,"teflon very poor it is coming off the pan, only uesd three time not happy, work good if not for that the tefion coing off"
3,Helps lower grease level.,"This pan in a pan does the job of lowering the level of grease in a meat loaf or whatever you cook, but the loaf is no easier to remove than from a regular pan."
1,Bad Product,"Purchased for a gift, was used all year long, never put in dish washer, only hand washed and now the bottom of the insert rusted! Would not recommend this product or buy another one of this kind."
1,Doesn't brown the meat....yuck,"It's a great idea but the dark pan keeps the meat from browning. It looks very unappetizing after cooking. It does keep the grease away from the meatloaf but I just can't stand the ""grey"" look the meat has after cooking instead of a nice browned loaf."
4,Nopro 2 piece pan set,I purchased this pan after seeing another brand advertised on TV. The first thing I used it for was to make a meatloaf. Since I use very lean ground beef in my meatloaf there wasn't much grease to drip out. I do think that the meatloaf cooked faster and more evenly because of the increased circulation.The bottom line on this type of pan is that it's nice to have but not a bake ware item you can't live without.
2,"i like it, but i don't!","This pan DOES keep the grease from saturating the meat-so functions well in this respect, BUT and hear this, it is IMPOSSIBLE to wear oven mitts and remove the inner pan! i ended up sticking a fork between the twp ""lips"" on the ""quasi-handles"" and trying frantically to grasp the pan. After much cursing, i got it up and out and flipped onto a plate, where when removed from the pan it fell apart and was much worse (in appearance) than a meatloaf made in my old glass pan! i would advice anyone in the market for a ""grease free meatloaf pan"" to get one that has HANDLES on the ends which enable you to seperate both pans! It does what is expected, but not efficiently or give a nice presentation with your meatloaf-"
3,"Pan Fine, Teflon Sorry","For my purposes this set is not particularly helpful or convenient. I use extra lean hamburger so there is very little runoff that needs to be drained. Using the pan without the insert it is more convenient to cut and serve the meatloaf from the pan and then refrigerate the remainder in the same pan. Using the insert requires that the meatloaf be removed whole from the pan before serving. This can be rather awkward and messy.This might be a good set for those who use standard hamburger in their meatloaf. It is a good solid set that should hold up well.Addendum: I have now used this pan for meatloaf about half dozen times. It works as promised. I am always gentle with my pans, using only plastic and cloth to clean them, yet the non-stick Teflon surface is already wearing off. I do not recommend this pan for the health nuts who are concerned about Teflon in their food. It's probably okay for everyone else. I still give the pan three stars."
2,great idea,"The double pan idea is great but the design should have allowed for more space between the bottoms of the pans,and the nonstick surface worked really well until it started to peel off after only 3 or 4 uses.!!"
2,Great Concept Not so Great Quality,I love the idea of the meatloaf pan and it works terrific. Meatloaf is one of my husband's favorite comfort foods and I was shocked to see how much fat had drained off even using a lean meat mixture. The unfortunate thing about the product is that the quality of the teflon very poor it does not stick BUT it scratches in a blink. Do not cut your meatloaf in the pan it will be a disaster. All I did was insert a wooden spatula under the meatloaf to lift it and it scratched the surface of the pan on the very first use. I guess you have to use the flip the meatloaf out of the pan method. Absolutely no hard surface should touch the surface of this pan if you expect any longevity from the product. If the fat from the meat doesn't degrade your health the teflon flakes will!
4,Good product for the price,"Good set of pans for the money. It really does work. Only wish it was easier to separate the two pans, Very difficult (especially just out of the oven)! The inserted pan's handles should be larger."
5,Sad and Touching!,"Storm Rescue was an awesome book! It was really sad and toaching at the same time! I've read many Wild at Heart books, and they're all good! You actally feel like you're there! Storm Rescue takes place from a cat lover who volunteers at Wild at Heart,! Her name is Sunita! She pet sts a cat named Lucy who has diabetes.

5,best game ive ever played,this game is the best game on earth if you liked any of the previous spec: ops games. the graphics are unbelievable. you can choose from a wide selection of weapons. the missions are great thrill rides. i'd recommend buying this game and all the other spec:ops games in the future.
2,very unplayable,"Haven't got to disc two yet, but disc one is very unplayable, even in the easy mode. If you pay full price for this you are a fool."
3,Micro Revision Tool,The book provides a conceptual and intuitive understanding of some basic mocro theories. The approach is very detail. I would reccomend this bok for the preparation of graduate microeconomics for those who needs a quick and clear revision of undergraduate consumer and production theories.
3,Another Solid Roundup,"Like the first in the series, a solid roundup of northern soul/r&b; of the 1960's (not including Motown or Philly) of course. Again, the best tracks are featured in many other compilations so if you're a long time collector, this might be of less interest to you as you probbaly already have the best tracks ... unless you're a completist.Like the CD cover, it's professional but not overly exciting nor was all that much creative effort expended in putting these tracks together. It's good, just not great.(for great - check out Zealous Records Presents Soul Sides)"
5,beautifully written,"This novel is stunning, elegant, and poetic. My favourite work by her next to Late Summer Passion of a Woman of Mind."
1,Fabio meets Max Plank,"A love novel for scientists. In a direct quote from page two which pretty much summed up my feelings about this book... ""This is interesting, though not very."" The author makes some witty jests thoughout the book, but I had trouble keeping interest in the main character's frequent rants to himself and even more frequent trips into delusions."
4,very impressive and well done,"This review is for the Criterion Colelction DVD edition of the film.""Testament of Dr. Mabuse"" know in Germany as ""Das Testament des Dr. Mabuse"" was Fritz Lang's last movie before leaving Germany to escape the Nazis. It was promptly banned in Germany after it's completion until the end of World War 2.I think it is one of his best films and is very well done. It follows the case of a policeman invesigating a case and clues lead to Dr. Mabuse who has been in a sanitatium for many years. it is discovered that he was writing a manifesto in his cell and it appears to predict future eventsThe film has some impressive acting and some very good special effects the best of which is of a fire at a factory with and the footage the smokestacks collapsing is very realisitc.This is a film that should not be missed."
4,Expressionistic Classic,"This is one of the last of the great expressionist claasics from UFA, made right before the Nazis took over Germany and made freedom of expression a thing of the past. Dr. Mabuse, played by the astounding Rudolf-Klein Rogge, embarks on a campaign of crime that is designed to do nothing more than to cause the breakdown of society and to spread chaos -- Mabuse's underlings spout actual Nazi propaganda, so what exactly is being attacked here is quite obvious. The cinematography is stunning and the acting is superb, but the use of voice I find rather decreases the visual impact of the expressionistic genre. After this film was made, Lang, the director, was forced to flee for his life as the Nazis imposed total control over Germany and UFA became a propaganda tool. The subplot of a decent man forced into a life of crime by poverty may also be of interest of thos who might wonder how a man like Hitler could have gained so much power in the first place."
1,This beginner felt woefully inadequate,"This is really hard for beginners. He holds poses for extended periods so that the viewer can fully appreciate and take in the posture. But I found holding some of the poses very trying on my out-of-shape muscles. There are no modifications shown. If you can't fully do the poses, it can become very frustrating and defeating quickly. As a beginner, I won't be doing this video again."
5,Top In ReAlignment of the Skeleton,"Great workout! Targets the heart, core, spine, major muscle groups. Builds overall Strength for all ages and levels of fitness."
4,Family tie builder,"This little game really gave our family a chance to reconnect. It was the first time we had sat down to play a game in a long while, we have teens. It was very positive and improved communication without working at it."
5,Lots of fun!,"Played this with our family. It is a lot of fun, and a learning experience for everyone. Everyone had a great time."
3,NOT for kids,"my mother brought this game home when I was 10 years old and my sister was 6. the box said something like 5 and up. many of the questions are about first kisses, dating, high school, jobs and other things we had not experienced yet. very few questions were things we could answer. the game was really frustrating and sat in the closet for years, where friends would suggest we play it, so we would have to explain what a bad game it was. I'm sure it's great for adults, but for kids, it's horrible.Don't buy this game for your kids!"
2,"Ghostly encounters with Elvis, George Reeves, and others!",This was an ok book (if you believe these tales) but I picked it up for the chapters on Elvis and TV Superman George Reeves because I am a fan of the two. It was a different type of read is about all I can say about it.
4,A Good Basic Overview,"The title says it all--this is a good basic overview of payroll. You will not become an expert by reading it, but what can you read that makes you an expert? This book will give you the vocabulary and the tools you need to take your first steps in payroll. After that experience is the best teacher."
1,Negative STARS--DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK IN ANY Format,"This book contains multiple errors in payroll reporting. Ones that can get you on a first name basis with the IRS and most state agencies. What is correct in this book is ""Well Duh!"" stuff you should learn in kindergarten. This book is a total waste of money and somewhat dangerous."
4,Pleasantly Pleased,"The product arrived sooner than expected. My first response when I smelled the vanilla was that I had been taken, but when my daughter made cookies with the vanilla we knew that we had made a good purchase."
4,The Magnificent Opera Atelier,"This production is magnificent. I had seen Opera Atelier live when they performed Orpheus and Eurydice in Cleveland Ohio a few years back. They embrace all aspects of the baroque style. I am as much a fan of opera as of ballet and this production is rich in both. The glorious period appropriate gestures of the singers add beauty and colour to the work. For all baroque purists such as myself, who desire our period peices as they were, in both sound and presentation than this is a must buy. The performers are magnificent. Cyril Auvity is the epitomee of Persee. And is a mervelous dancer in addition to having a fine, light voice perfect for period peices. He has a sound like two other great tenors of baroque, Paul Agnew and Jean-Paul Fouchecourt. Though I doubt they dance as well as he. This is a must buy, so BUY it. You will love it and it will give you many hours of pleasure as it has done for me."
3,"Good Game, Buy It!!!","Me And My Sister Played This Game 3 years Ago And We Loved It! We Got To The Very Last Part Of It And Then We Got Stuck, Couldn't Figure It Out. We Never Finished. Its A Hard Game, Takes A While To Beat Too. Realistic Looking CGI. Sometimes Its Kinda Creepy Becuase You'll Go Into A Room With Dead Bodies On Tables (GROSS) But Its Not Very Bloody. And The 'Dream World' Or whatever It Was Called, Was Creepy And Scary With Those Bat-Things Flying Around Trying To Attack You! But It Was A Good, Even Tho Difficult Game."
3,really hard,"i have been an xmen fan for a long long time and i cant say that i really like this game.it is very fun to play but very very very hard and you have to unlock all the characters.for instence gambit is my favorite character and you have to unlock him on the third level and the levels are so long and hard,like the sewer level(third level) farther within the sewer level there will be so many enimies that you will find your self in a life or death run for it to the door to the next part of the level and when your doing this running for the exit with about 35 enimies on your tale theres a 30% chance you will make it.and when your not on a mission you have to controll a girl mutant named alison(magma)"
3,for xmen fans only,"The game took me about 6 hours to 100% beat without a guide on my first playthrough. It's not worth the full price. It was good while it lasted though. Players lvl up characters, and add ability points to stats similar to the shinning tears game. Graphics are average, contols are usable, and the camera functions are fine most of the time. There appears to be a limit on the max EXP available. This means you can't crank all of the characters to their max lvl."
3,Is it really worth the time?,"Well, about a week ago I got this game and I gave up on it about a half hour into it. The graphics are good, the controls are easy, and the battle system is alright, but I played for a long time as wolverine only to die like three times at the hands of mystic (who, by the way, has guns to combat your claws, like that makes sense). Frankly, I'd suggest LOTR: The Third Age over this game. I dropped this one for it, anyway.Graphics: 9/10 (It's an overhead view)Characters/Plot: N/A (I can't rate that, I haven't gotten that far)Battles: 8/10Worth it? You decide. I disliked it though."
2,BAD GRAPHICS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this game might be fun but has bad graphics,that annoyed me when i played.BAD GRAPHICS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Light Program is far superior,I have been an Asia fan since day one and a huge fan of Geoff Downes in particular. I greatly looked forward to hearing the World Service CD but was sadly disappointed. The music is fine and very representative of Downes' style but the songs are so short that you just begin to get interested in them and they are over. Its like listening to a bunch of song clips. Its a cool idea to create an album of songs that depict the feel of various countries but it would have been better done with 10 full songs than 30 snipits. If you are looking for a great instrumental album that showcases the style and full talents of Geoff Downes I would highly recommend you go with The Light Program rather than this disc.
1,REGION????????,"I never got to watch the dvd, as the one you sent me (twice) was not for my region; therefore, it would not play in my dvd player. I was very disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Everybody Loves Raymond season five,"This season of ELR was given to me as a gift a while ago. I played it and it would not play in my player. I tried another one and it would not play in that machine either. Unable to take it back since I had it too long, I ordered another. It arrived in short order. It too would not play in any player in which I tried it. So I returned it quickly. I have all the other seasons and all play on both of our machines."
5,everything was perfect,Everything was perfect what i asked for the shipping the product the price absolutely perfect no complaints at all I would recommend and definately use amazon.com again.
4,ELR Season 5,"Everybody Loves Raymond - The Complete Fifth Season, is another journey well-worth taking with this great cast. Season number 5 is full of some hilarious episodes, and also some average episodes. It is difficult for a show to be great every week, though this series comes close. One of the hi-lights in this great series includes the episode Wallpaper in which Marie drives into Ray and Debra's living room. One of the hilarious episodes includes Ray finding out that Marie read his diary which included some incredibly private [measurement] moments. Four solid stars."
5,Hilarious Show!,"I love this show, and this season did not disappoint! It includes the Italy episodes and quite a few Robert-centered episodes. A great buy!"
1,false advertising,"Same complaints as those on the second picture of the advertised item. I bought it for my daughter based on the pictures, and what I received was a different stuffed animal. They're lucky I'm too busy getting ready for Christmas to return the item for a refund. Definately not worth the $20-25."
4,Short but functional,Good for bike bag. You cannot get too much leverage so don'texpect to fully tighten some higher torque locations.
5,"Not an Acapella fan, but was FLOORED by this CD",This group played at my sons school here in Germany (U.S. Military) He convinced my wife to go to the repeat concert at the H.S. They enjoyed it so much they bought the CD. I was forced to listen to it and I loved it. It is INCREDIBLE!!!! They make music that has to be heard to be belived. DON'T MISS THIS CD.
1,Not useful,"I generally have been very pleased with DeWalt tools, and had high expectations for a table to use with my DW621. I was disappointed. The ""table"" is about 10 in. by 10 in. The fence is fixed, going on the theory that you move the router along two bars underneath the ""table"" to make adjustments. However, they only allow about 3/4 in. of clearance to move the router, so this is the extent of adjustment of the ""fence."" Even if this narrow range fits your needs, the bit clearance on the fence is not high enough to use the router at full plunge for most bits. I cannot figure out if there actually is use for this table. The kit comes with several router accessories - trammel bar, edge guide and several other things. If you are not very familiar with these things, they are useless as there is no documentation for any of them included. Only buy this product if you are well aware of exactly what you are getting. I gave it 1 star only because I couldn't give anything less."
4,Very Informative,"I found this manual to be informative. The authors knew what they were talking about, instead of being on the outside. They wrote with experience which is helpful to any level of coach and player alike. I really enjoyed reading this manual and will keep it as part of my professional library."
1,Tommy Habeeb is not present.!,All of the Eye For An Eye DVD's claming to star Tommy Habeeb do not have him. They instead have poorly edited episodes with Tommy blurred out and Kato Kaelin inserted in. BUYER BEWARE!
2,My first Anovulatory cycle with vitex,"I normally ovulate around cycle day 17-20.I wanted to give it a shot to shorten my cycles.The very first month, when I took for month long based on dosage proscribed, I didn't ovulate for that month. This was the first an ovulatory cycle for me. I have normal 14 days luteal phase. I guess ,this is not for the women who has normal LP and regular cycles. Just think and research more before jump into it."
1,Hair loss,"I bought this product a few months ago, in hopes of conceiving. Instead, I am still not pregnant and have lost almost half of the hair on my head. My diet hasn't changed and I am only 27, that's the only new change in my life. Very disappointed"
1,no change,"i've taken this on and off for a year now - no change in anything. no change in monthly cycle - no pregnancy --- it don't think it hurts to take it, but no change here."
3,Something is working!!,"I bought this product in May of 2008, and I must say that my last menstrual cycle was a lot lighter than before!!!!! I just need to keep in mind that I've only used it for one month and I need to keep this up. I haven't concieved yet, but I know it's coming!!!! Good luck with all the other women out there that are on this product!"
1,Digestive upset,"I tried Vitex for hot flashes as recommended by my sister. She swears by it and takes it regularly. But not only did it not help me, it gave me life altering digestive disturbances. I couldn't be very far from a bathroom and actually had a couple of potentially embarrassing incidences. After a while I decided that my misery was caused by the Vitex and stopped taking it. It took months to get my system back to normal. I recommend caution when trying any herbal supplement and be alert to any changes from normal."
4,TTC/Incredible Herb,"I am 23 years old and have had irregular periods for about a year now, my periods would have me spotting for weeks and I would have HUGE gaps between menses.. my hormones were all out of whack! The doctor prescribed me PROVERA to induce AND supposedly REGULATE my period. Provera induced my period but it didnt correct the problem. I began charting my temps on FF and on CD 23,after provera, I started taking vitex 3x a day. The chart shows that I ovulated CD 46 and AF came CD 53.Which means my luteal phase only lasted 7 days. This is my second cycle using Vitex, I also bought a clearblue digital ovulation test... I got a positive OPK cd 20 and according to my chart this is the day I also ovulated! Vitex has cut my cycle length IN HALF in a matter of 6 weeks! I am now 5DPO and in the 2WW. Im hoping that this is the cycle I will conceive : )For the record Ive had no side effects! And the pill does exactly what it says it will I will come back and post my 2WW results!"
2,Made me feel sick,"I tried to take this vitamin to help conceive with my PCOS. I'm pretty sensitive to hormone medicines like birth control pills and clomid. I was hoping since this was more of a vitamin I wouldn't have problems. The first couple nights I took it I woke up feeling groggy and a little loopy, but not too bad. The fourth night I took it I felt really weird: It made me feel really anxious, I couldn't sleep and I felt sick to my stomach. I don't have problems with anxiety or depression or anything. I can't really say how it works since I will not be taking it anymore. Oh, I was only taking one pill a day."
1,Headache,"Started taking Vitex 3 days ago. All 3 days having headache and light dizziness. Not sure what to do now. Read in the Internet, that i should wait and it will go away naturally. But ....should i ???? Thats why i have it 1 star. Will try to stop for a week and see if the headache will go away. Im so sad, because thats really my only hope to get my cycle back naturally. :-(((("
1,Do NOT use if you have regular cycles!!!!,"My husband and I have been ttc for 15 months. I have regular periods of about 29-30 days each. I bought this in the hope that it would give me the boost I need and maybe clean up my system as I read on other sites. Well, only 7 pills into it, my ovaries hurt SO bad. I found out that they were the size of apples! Then, my period came 10 days late. When it did come, it was SO terribly painful and full of clots. Please save yourself some pain and SO NOT take this if you have regular cycles!"
3,No results,I know it takes time.. But I thought I would have seen somewhat of an improvement by now. Guess ill just have to wait it out
2,It didn't work for me!,"I am TTC and have a 32-36 day cycle, after four months of taking this and 1200 MG to 1600 MG every month, I saw no change."
3,is it normal,iv been taking these pill Vitex fruit to get regulated an hope to get pregnant i startd on the 5th .1-5-13. an it made me start my p.m.s .it's 1-18-13 an i'm still bleeding an now passing blood clots . dose this meant it's cleaning out my uterus an the clot have been stuck there .. an this pill is helping . i was check out by my do 12-13-12 an my uterus is swelled .no baby no infection . an he said my uterus was lined with super thick like blood clot . i was freak but he said it will go away . i read up about this stuff it helps you blood out trash an regulated us . but can it help to get my uterus back to normal .. i dont under stand an my Doctor acks like its not a big deal . but it is to me .can anyone help.
2,Makes Your Monthly Cycles 28 Days (Temp. ) - But Will Not Help You To Conceive.,I took this product for 4 months and it made my cycle go from 31 days to 28 days. It controlled my bleeding. I only bleed for 3 to 4 days instead of 7 to 10 days each month. I thought this product would help me to conceive. But it didn't. I eventually started taking Clomid. And I conceived on the 1st cycle. The only problem is that I don't believe you can take it longer than 6 months to a year. So I suppose their is no real reason to take this product at all. So in the end I would not recommend this product.
1,DON'T BUY,"IT IS HORRIBLE!!!MADE ME GAIN 5-6 POUNDS IN 3 DAYS...I felt so so big,plus THE END OF THE MONTH I WAS 5 DAYS LATE AND NOT PREGNANCY(I HAS BEEN NEVER LATE),THANKS TO ZXT I LOST MY WEIGHT BACK.DONT BUY THIS."
5,I took Vitex for my acne,"I have been taking Vitex for over a month now and I've had an amazing experience with it. I have suffered from consistent, but mild acne since I was 18(I'm 28 now). I've suspected that my acne was linked to a hormonal imbalance because I have always had a very irregular menstrual cycle. Instead of taking birth control as a means to regulate my hormones, I opted for something herbal so I found Vitex. I haven't had a breakout in a month!! My skin looks great and for the first time EVER I got my period in exactly 28 days. If you are at all like me, I absolutely recommend giving Vitex a try."
1,This herb may cause suicidal tendencies or severe depression,"After a few days of taking this I seriously considered suicide. After reading about this product more, I realized this was not just me, it was the herb.You should not take this herb if you are on the pill. You should not take this herb if you have endometriosis. It may make your symptoms much much worse as it did to me. DO NOT take this if you have ever had side effects from the pill, they may intensify. This can be a very dangerous herb which may cause severe depression and/or suicide.There are vitamins which can help safely (and more effectively) listed here: Magnesium citrate 600 mg, B6 (in a complex of 25-50 per B vitamin) and Zn (40 mg/day). Take these for 6-12 weeks instead. Please.Please be very very careful if you buy this and watch your moods carefully."
3,"Not a hub, but a switch branded as a hub","Beware if you are looking for a ""hub"" for packet sniffing. This is a switch that is labeled hub. True hubs are very hard to find. Look online for lists of true hubs."
2,Not really a good humidifier for its supposed reliability.,"After reading the review of the product which interests me and then making a purchase I was really disappointed with the overall consistency and performance of the Vicks 1.2 Cool Mist humidifier. The number of things which disappoints me, is the flimsy plastic housing that fits funny when assembled. Also the filter that is not supplied with the humidifier must be carefully assembled so the cover fits snug over the filter. The second is the fan. It is so noisy that it is literally a huge distraction and that the humidity doesn't actually distributes through the vent. I purchased another humidifier which works a lot better than the previous humidifier I've purchased. I am going to give it away through charity And the Optimus which I recently purchased and then received,has been proven to work much better than the Vicks 1.2. Cool Mist Humidifier. So much for the inconsistency of the previous reviews of the user."
3,new barbie collector,"I found the book ok i am still just reading through it , i didnt find the photos as good as other Barbie books i have bought"
3,Bring Me a ream,I spent so much time reading about her problem with male of the world. I would have love to read and feel her as true boyguard and not this hot an cold person or better yet she could have remain a policeman and work as a bodyguard on the side.
1,goji berries,I would not buy these goji berries. They are very hard to chew even when put with milk for cereal. They have no flavor at all. If you consider buying goji berries try a diffferent brand which is what I will do in the future.
2,"Dreadful Aftertaste, Bitter","Having read quite a bit about Goji berries and their health benefits, I ordered a 3-pack to give them a whirl. If you eat them raw, they're vile. They have a hideous, bitter, dry aftertaste that lingers and requires you to drink something quickly or rip out your tongue.I have tried to bake them into muffins and various baked goods to nullify the Goji berries' aftertaste, but with no such luck.Goji berries may be healthy, but the hideous and lingering aftertaste just don't work for me. But it was worth a try."
2,Maybe too old school,I never played Myst on computer or anything when I was a kid so I snapped it up on the Saturn for fun at like 2$. I just cant hang. Its so slow and limited (at least in this day and age). I didnt realize it was a point n zoom in adventure. Takes a lot of patience. The graphics are good but lifeless and dont hold up when you are close. I will go back and explore this one more later but maybe this is just for nostalgia.
5,LOVE THIS BOOK!,This is a great story of an Ozark teacher. I read it many times over and love it more each time!
3,How to rate this??,"I don't know how to rate this book. Of course the problem of street children is important -- of course we should all care. Of course we should have a commitment to do something about it. But....I just didn't like this book in terms of fiction. The whole structure, the simon magus stuff, the Loudon background, just seemed silly and pointless to me. And I just didn't like the writing. OK, lots of folks disagree with me, and that is what personal opinion is all about. But I would much rather read a really good study of street children, with some recommendations of what we can do. All that other stuff was just silly. But I gave this three stars because it did make me think about street children, and also about how a book could have all the components that I love and still not work for me."
1,A HEAP for sure,"This book is not a thriller..it is a book with a malevolent attitude toward children. Literally nothing happens until the last pages and even then ...like duh!!!!I made the mistake of buying into the reviews. Do not waste your money or time...HEAP is an apt title, but a HEAP of lousy writing is not what i was looking for...."
3,eh...so so,"Engaging story....but not as mesmerizing as the all the reviews claim. The story line about the children was interesting and the story line about the religious mystery was interesting...but I wasnt feeling the connection. Some parts were so allegorical I felt like I was in a high school english class. The childrens wisdom seemed unbelievable even if they had ""street smarts""."
3,For die hard Groove Armada fans,"I became a fan of Groove Armada last Spring after hearing ""Inside My Mind"" off the Vertigo albumb in a coffee house in Amsterdam. Vertigo is a great and complete albumb. The Remixes albumb has only a hint of what makes Vertigo so great. It does have a tendency to get repetetive. Mostly there are only straight forward beats to be offered here without much to make the tracks unique. However there are a few exceptions that I really like. I recomend buying it if you already have the first two albumbs and the ""Back to Mine"" albumb and you still need more.But if your looking to explore Groov Armada further and dont yet have their first albumb or ""Back to Mine"" get one of those first. ""Back to Mine"" is a great comp of music that has influenced Groove Armada from Soul to Hip Hop to House...It's a much better move then this one."
2,"Fine with CO2 cartridge, useless as a hand pump.","With CO2 cartridges, the unit works fine, but is heavier than plain CO2 units. As a hand pump, I have not yet been able to make a dent on my road tires; I actually loose pressure.I do not recommend it."
5,Don't overlook this hip hop gem!,"One of the most talented and overlooked hitters in hip hop / funk today. Pete and crew drop well written raps over deeply crafted, funky grooves. Check out the Hammonds kickin' in the background. Pete can deliver with the best of them, and he knows how to dish out old school flavor AND push the music forward at the same time.The album's great, and the live performances are amazing. Check him out before he gets HUGE!"
2,not Bill Myers at his best,"After reading numerous books by Bill Myers, he became one of my top four favorite authors. But after finishing this one, I had to wonder if it was even written by him. The constant reference to Helen being attractive to all the men really got annoying. Enough of the silky, clingy short clothing and move on. Save that for the romance novels. The story seemed to drag on and on and I found myself skipping through a lot, especially towards the end with all the screaming each others' names over and over. This one just didn't cut if for me, unlike some of his other books, which I found intriguing and thought-provoking (eg. ""Eli"")"
1,Great read!,Great book! Fast moving and interesting. I really cared as bout the characters. Read it in 3 days! It is a fast read.
4,Worth the read,"While it was an easy read, I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was interesting and made me think. Definitely worth the read!"
2,Great plot-limited vocabulary,"The plot was great but the author's vocabulary could have used some divine intervention. The word ""brief"" was used three times in the first three sentences of the book. I nearly put the book down before I had finished the first page. Secondly, I found it bothersome that the phrase ""she blew her hair (or bangs). . .""was used eight times in reference to Helen. The character development was also lacking."
5,Tools For Life,"For ten years I have worked the six step process described in this little book. I am so very grateful this toolkit for life was made available to me, and I am delighted to see it in book form. The steps have enabled me to become more happy and whole than ever I dreamed possible. Find this out for yourself, if you choose to, by learning the six step process and implementing it in your daily life. With appreciation and joy in my heart and soul, I recommend this book and all that it makes possible."
2,cute but very thin material,"The dress has a cute style, but the material is so thin and flimsy it rolls up on the ends and looks cheap. Although the dress was a good price, the shipping and handling doubled the cost, so it was not such a bargain in the end."
4,A very nice English/Spanish Book,This is a nice book if you are attempting to expose your young child to both English and Spanish nouns. Note that their is no pronunciation guide for the non-Spanish speaking parent.
4,A great summer read,"Alan Russell's latest book is not my favorite. Multiple Wounds still holds that honor. But Exposure is a very compelling read and would make a welcome addition to any beach bag.Sparked by the idea that a paparazzo was responsible for the death of Princess Diana, the story takes off from there. It pulls the surprisingly likeable paparazzo protagonist (and the reader) into a bizarre confrontation with a monstrous villain through a series of plausibly rendered plot twists.Both the scene that triggers the action and the scene that caps it are edge-of-your-seat vivid. Russell's sense of humor, sometimes slapstick and sometimes sly, plays hide and seek throughout the story, and a good helping of Hollywood trivia rounds out the book's attractions. This is a perfect book to take on a long, lazy summer weekend."
2,Nyah,"We bought this to match the oil rubbed bronze theme in our half bath. The thing is basically black. Doesn't tie in as well as I'd hoped. Also says it fits Wellworth Kohler, but it was too long for my Wellworth. I had to cut it, drill a hole and attach a key ring to make it work. It's also way overpriced. Should be $8.99 for what it is."
2,Not Kohler's Best Work,"I'll keep this short and sweet: Like other reviewers, I bought a few of these to replace stock ones on my Kohler toilets. I was very disappointed by the quality, these are spot-on el cheapo just like you would get in the bargain bin at a big box store. the handle itself is OK but the pull arm is cheap plastic and instead of screws, is simply peened over the arm. No modifying it easily, stock handle is way better. Back it goes."
3,Great music...by a zombie,"I really love Loussier's stuff but unless you enjoy your artist's with a blank stare, you don't need to see him work. It's nice if you need your HDTV and home stereo to be doing something during a party, but it will just help you sleep if you watch it"
5,"Mesmerising, engrossing, haunting!!!","In Melanie Jackson's second book, and in it she weaves a tale of the Scottish Highlands, with the canny feyness that makes you think she lived it in another time. I write history and lore of the Picts and Celts, so I generally cringe when I read a Scottish Historical. NOT THIS ONE!!!From the opening pages, she takes you into the mind of a woman who stands alone, who has the full weight of her clan upon her shoulders, cares little for men and the wars, only the survival of her people and she is willing to ensure this even to committing murder.I could not put this book down!!WISE Writers and Readers Historical Selection"
1,Not what I expected,"After reading other reviews, I am skeptical about writing a review myself. I was very disappointed in this book. I only finished the book because I like to finish what I start. I did not understand the book. It felt like the book revolved around two people only. It felt as if though the the storyline kept jumping from one to another without explaining itself. All I know about the book was that it was cold and raining all the time. And that the main male character didn't like staying on the island of Iona. I didn't understand their plans. I was just lost! I don't even know what else I can say about the book, because even though I read it a week ago, I don't even remember the characters! I have read numerous scottish tales, and this was the worst."
1,Iona,"I was realy disappointed in this book! The author was continually describing a very desolate island and how persecuted the clan was, I felt totally depressed and would not read another book from this author. There was hardly a good story and I really struggled to finish this book and I am a big fan of this kind of romance!"
4,Faceting for Amatours V4,This is a great book. Delivery was just three days. However I consider the price ($300) I paid to be way too much. As soon as I bought my copy the seller jacked the price up for another copy even higher. There are other books currently being published almost as good for a lot less.
3,"Good, but not the best methods for bass trombonists","After listening to the excerpts, I recognized Jeffrey Reynolds' perspective. He is an experienced player, but some of his advice is not as practical as it seems. For the Franck excerpt, common orchestral practice is to play the f-sharp as written: it is an applicable range study and should be kept intact. The Schumann excerpt is not played as written also, and should be taken literally in the context that it was written. Mr. Reynolds' approach to Wagner is interesting, especially to Die Walkure. It's not for everyone, but it may be beneficial to some. The Kodaly is well presented, as well as the Mahler, Berg, and Strauss excerpts. All things considered, it is a decent aide for study, but should not be seen as a ""this is how it must be done"" collection of excerpts."
3,Nunquam,"This book is somewhat outdated, however, it remains a witty and intelligent satire of modern science. Despite the obscure humor and fascinating idiosyncrasies of it's characters, the subject matter is quite dark. It attempts a subtle warning against man's love-affair with technology."
1,Lawsuitlarity ensues,"The Rival is a masterful design, spinning each kernel out at the perfect temperature -- to explode in the bowl or in the air as it hurtles towards your face. That's not to say it pops every kernel, some it heats just enough to lay as flaming caltrops of doom across the kitchen floor so if you're foolish enough to retreat from the initial bombardment it's likely one of these will burn a hole in your toe like the one on mine tonight.Overall it begs the question, does anyone actually test consumer products anymore? It's one thing to put a design to paper but this thing should have been scrapped in the first trials.Still if you're looking for a popper to recreate that Calvin and Hobbes comic where they pop the corn without the lid, this one would be good for that."
1,Wish I would have read these review before I bought today,Bought this today at Walmart. Used tonight and it goes in the garbage in the morning. Wished I hadread these reviews before. Will never buy anything from rival again.d
1,Horrible and dangerous design; waste of money,"Though visually appealing, it is the worst engineering design ever -- there is no chute for the popcorn to be guided into a bowl. I agree with other writers -- popcorn and hot kernels everywhere, which pop wherever they land and have a bland taste. TONS of unpopped kernels in the bottom of the bowl, with a burned scorch to them. The Rival seems to be a truly dangerous design, and it's hard to believe they haven't voluntarily or involuntarily recalled it. Over the years, I have had much better experience with Presto and want to return to Presto, even though it is a less visually appealing design -- OK if you like 70s retro, though!"
1,Not very safe,I can't believe that none of the other reviews mentioned that this thing does not have an on/off switch. You plug it in when you want to use it and then unplug it. That seems a bit unsafe to me.
1,AWFUL,"This popper leaves most kernals unpopped and burns most of the others. It is loud and takes forever. You would probably get better results by just shoving a hair dryer in a bowl of popcorn (don't try this at home, though). I tried it with store brand popcorn and with Orville Redenbacher popcorn. Results were unacceptable with both brands, though slightly better with the Redenabacher corn. Sounds like Presto is much better. I'm going to try that."
1,Don't buy this,"The other reviewer's have it right , this thing is a hunk of junk. I can't believe they sell this product. About 1/3 to 1/2 of the kernels you put in aren't popped - they just end up in the bottom of the bowl & all over the counter & floor. Way too much trouble to clean up."
1,Rival PP25 is a disaster,"Do not buy this popcorn maker! It launches unpopped and hot kernels all over the place, so you have a nice clean-up job associated with every use.Clearly no product testing done by the manufacturer. Time for a general recall as my son got burned when a hot kernel landed on his arm.Also noted on another Amazon site (UK version) that the maker got rave reviews. Something is up!"
1,Should be recalled,"I have to agree with the sentiment that it should be recalled as defective.The unit fails to pop about 1/3 of the popcorn used, its chute design throws popcorn and hot unpopped kernels everywhere (which encourages people to make unsafe 'add ons' to the chute to capture the mess), it has no safety features such as a 'tip switch', a timer, an 'overheating switch' or even just a plain old 'on/off' switch.Of course I may be just a bit biased since we had a garage fire caused by a PP25 last weekend that destroyed it, a computer system and a chair.Do not buy under any circumstances."
5,Nice product!!!,This is a really nice product that dresses up my truck very well. It was very easy to install with the proper tools. Although it was not specified to fit a Dakota; it fits my 2005 Dodge Dakota SLT perfectly. And Amazon had the lowest price I could find anywhere both in retail automotive parts stores or on the internet.
2,Not worth it,"I'd rather have my money back than this table but its too much of a hassle to pack it up and send it back. The plastic pushers came crushed but were immediately replaced. The pucks just don't slide that well on the table. A disappointment after the mini pool table. The pool table is awesome. Quality built, just a mini version of real pool."
2,Not Kurosawa's best,"Kurosowa has made some terrific films, but this isn't one of them. It's plodding pace and bland story put me to sleep."
2,"A good, not great, early Kurusawa","But as with all his films of the occupation period, the look into Japan at the time is worth the price of admission. Compare the Japan of this film (food-rationing, unemployment, desperation, violent crime) to the thrusting 1960s Japan of 'High and Low'. The social message in Stray Dogs is curiously ambivalent."
5,Another Kurosawa gem!,"Vastly underrated film, wonderful portrait of post war Japan. Mifune is masterful"
5,Stray Dog,"Landmark, atmospheric Japanese noir helped cement Kurosawa's reputation as a director to watch. Not only is ""Dog"" a satisfying thriller, it exposes the thin line between a vengeful cop and his base and desperate prey. Superb film also fascinates in capturing a scarred Tokyo in the wake of the Second War."
2,Dissappointing follow up to Echo Park....,"Feeder have been perhaps one of the best, and my favorite, pop-punk guitar bands since Husker Du, and they have been churning out one loud, riff-and-hook laden album after another. Which is why I didn't mind plunking down the extra cash for this new one. It's a sure winner, right?? Boy was I duped.Apparently the suicide of the drummer caused a major style change, cause this thing is MELLOW. Every single tune. Gone are the loud guitars, my friends. If you like their ballads, then you will love this one. I wish I would of known before blowing 20 bucks. Buyer beware!!!"
1,This game Sucks!,"This game is the worst ever. The graphics are bad, the story is completly stupid! I wouldn't buy this game, if I were you I'd buy Custom Robo now that game is SWEET!"
2,BY FAR NOT THE BEST GAME IN THE SERIES!,"I was eggerly awaiting the arival of this game only to be extremely disappointed. What was EA doing? The game is terribly short and is just not as good as the other two preciding it. Yes, you get to play as Harry, Ron, and Hermonie which in itself is fun but it lacks the depth of the previous games. The game is lacking something, besides not being able to play Quiditch. What was EA thinging, not letting Harry play Quiditch. Don't get me wrong, the game is alright and parts of it are really challenging but it needs more, alot more. In the end all I have to say is don't waist your money on this game, rent it or buy it used."
1,"My son likes this game, but the quality of the game he received is not what was stated. It doesn't always work.","I don't know if I will buy a used game from amazon.com again. The game I purchased doesn't always work. It worked for a few days and then the disk started saying it could not be read. My son is older and very careful with his games, so I know it is not from his use. He only played it a few times. I am not impressed!"
4,This is the Best Harry Potter Game!,"I have played all of the other Harry Potter games and this one is the best! You can play as Ron, Harry, and Hermione, and there are more spells. Also all the creatures in the game are in the Harry Potter books. The graphics are really good. But it is the shortest game and it took me six hours to beat. You cannot play all the mini games unless you have a Gameboy Advance and a link cable. But still it is worth buying."
4,This game is awsome!,"This game is awsome! I only got it 3 days ago and I really like it. The Best Part is that you can fly Buckbeak. The spells they use in the game are great,but the only problem is that you cant play quidich like in the other 2 games.My advise to you is BUY THIS GAME!!!"
1,Nearly all cans are dented,"Received 12 cans inside a box that was torn open at one end and taped back. Of the 12 cans inside at least 8 were dented. Of the 8 dented, 6 were heavily dented.The food is delicious that we ate from one of the un-dented cans.Packaging of this product must be improved or I will not order more of this."
1,Pathetic,"This is a pathetic excuse for Punjabi Chholle. Over powered with Garam Masala, and very oily. I read the earlier reviews and bought this...but what a mistake."
5,Great product,Just what I needed. Customer service was very helpful and nice. would buy again. Works great fast shipping.
4,Nice Speakersw,"Nice remote speakers. Good wireless reception to 50 feet. Good sound for a small speaker of this type. BNRIGHT power indicator lights on speakers can be irritating depending on location, but a small piece of electrical tape cures that. Better sounding than the 300 dollar JBL's to my ear."
5,Linear Delta 3 System Garage Door opener receiver,This item was very easy to replace the malfunctioning one and has worked perfectly since it was installed. We are very pleased with it.
5,Door Opener,I was satisfied with the purchase. The order arrived before schedule. Everything was in order. I will do business with this store again.
4,esential reading for the transducer acoustician,"This consise and precise book gives almost all the information you will need to gain a great understanding of the acoustics envolved in modelling transducer's acoustic properties. Sometimes tough reading, but rigourous."
4,Candle In The Wind,This is the original published version of Elton John's Candle In The Wind. It shows all the verse variations and is arranged for intermediate-plus players.
5,This watch is gorgeous!,"This watch is gorgeous! It is the perfect gift for a man who doesn't wear much jewelry. It came fast, too! Ordered around the busy holiday season, this watch came earlier than expected at no additional charge from the seller."
2,Fossil AM3997 Degrade Stainless Steel Black Dial Watch,"I bought this watch for myself even though it's categorized as a women's watch. I have a small wrist so I thought that this watch would be a fit since men's watches are too big for my wrist. Also, the watch doesn't look that feminine. But when it finally arrived, I was totally disappointed because it was still too big for me. I think it should be categorized as a men's watch and not a women's watch because the case diameter, thickness, and band width are not ideal for women. My father, who has a bigger wrist, ended up wearing the watch.(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review. However, the opinion stated in the review is that of the reviewer and the reviewer alone. Further, the reviewer independently selected this product to review and has no affiliation with the product maker/distributor, Amazon or the review requester.)"
3,Too big for a woman watch.,"Too big for a woman watch. Even thou i know bigger watches for women, this one doesn't look very feminine, i ordered for my girlfriend ended using it my self."
5,Fossil Watch Review,The watch was a gift for my son and he was very pleased with it. He said it was even nicer than he thought it would be (he picked it out).
4,For the 80's Enthusiast!,"Awesome! Narly! Cool beans! This CD has the best part of the eighties compiled together. Some of these songs have become extremely hard to find and if you're so lucky to find them you're paying out more money on songs you don't want. Been there, done that! Totally excellent for those collecting!"
2,Old-fashioned approach,"I really had great expectations about this book because of the previous reviews, but I got frustrated to see that it has such an old-fashioned approach. The exercises for sight singing progress based on the number of alterations that appear on the key signature. Today we know that the relationship between the different grades in a tonality are the same, wether you sing in D flat major or in D major or in any other key. The range of the melodies are quite difficult for singing and they are written in an instrumental style, not vocal. This is book is not a good choice for teaching sight singing."
3,half and half,well i thought it was pretty easy. I finished it in like 4 days(only cause i rented it). But in bits of it you keep dying so you have to do that bit over and over again. like when your trying to save sirius. The two player sucks and you dont play quidditch in this one. But buckbeack is cool to fly.P.S.Watch out for those pixies
2,HP3,This specific disc stops working at the same spot in the game which is very annoying because I was having such fun. Guess I'll have to buy another one because I really LOVE this game!!!!
4,game,i purchased the game and it didnt work. i had to get it resurfaced. i notified amazon and i was reimbursed immediately
4,Okay,"I have read all the Harry Potter books and seen all the movies. Coming from a fan, I really enjoyed the game. Let me tell you the pros and cons of this game.Pros:You can fly around using a hipogriff.You can roam around the castle.Switch between characters.Interact with other characters.Attend classes.Use spellsBeautiful graphics.Cons:Long loading time in between roomsNo quidditch.Castle is not that elaborate as I would have preferred. (Much better in HP 5)Ron and Hermoine constantly nag you about what you should be doing when you roam)This game is very fun, but it could have been a little better. I would recommend it."
1,A complete waste of time and money!,"How do books like this even get published? Seriously? I kept reading hoping it would get better, but it is the most ridiculous approach to swing mechanics I have ever seen.A new low...wish I could gove it 0 stars"
4,Super clarinet playing,"If one is a clarinet enthusiast when its played well, then this performance is for you. The music is fascinating and the performances top notch. I am very pleased to own this CD."
3,Good but not excellent,"Though Larry Combs is recognized as one of the better clarinetists of the 20th Century this recording does not portray that recognition. The tone is a bit spready and rough around the edges, it lacks the more refined quality of contemporary players like Ricardo Morales or Jon Manasse. In addition the counting in the Scherzo from a Midsummer Night's Dream is a bit off, Combs enters early on the eighth notes preceding the infamous trilled figure. Overall it is refreshing to have a recording of only clarinet excerpts, however this is not the definitive way of playing those same excerpts."
1,Coulden't get it to work with XP,"I used to play this game when it first came out and it was great.I bought the CD and for what ever reason, I coulden't get this wo work on my XP machines.. I tried 2 different PC's and I coulden't get it to work...I work for IT....lol.. so good luck."
3,Good to listen to once,"The long cycle of oratorios by the completely forgotten Felix Draeseke is interesting to listen to once or twice, and only then as a curiosity. This work sounds like J.S. Bach's St. Matthew Passion as written by Richard Wagner. He makes good use of traditional Lutheran hymns. It is understandable though, why this work has fallen into obscurity (this recording being the first performance of the piece since the early 1900's). Draeseke simply doesn't have the dramatic flair nor the theological insight to make the music interesting."
4,Excellent whether or not you can repair other vehicles,"I found this book very useful, and will keep it on my shelf as a reference book. Although I already knew how to fix and maintain many car/truck items already, I found it very useful and think its good also for those who have not tried their hand at repairing other vehicle types.Overall, I was happy with the purchase and would recommend it."
2,"For those Know, it helps explain","I have that manual and I have found it minimally helpful. Very rarely does it seem to address the specific problem with which I am dealing. It appears to be more advanced and I suspect to the knowledgeable handy man, it makes a lot of sense. For the average novice however, not so much. If you're a novice and looking for a guide on a small project...this isn't for you. A manual that trys to be everything for everybody isn't for a novice."
2,Disappointed,"The purchase of the book was a mistake. The bulk of the information is cut and paste from various manufacturer's websites. The few photos are old and grainy. Clearly the book is pre-""take a great pic with a cell phone and upload it"". Again, there is nothing really wrong with book other than dated information and lack of much real insight. My suggestion is save your money and google your RV issue- you will find the source information that was borrowed for the book."
2,not very detailed,This book has a bunch of general descriptions about repairs but nothing detailed so it isn't very useful if your planning to do your own repairs.
4,must have for fulltimers,"this book is a must have for any full timer that wishes to maintain his/her rv themselves. as a traveling electrician, i sometimes get into areas where getting someone to come out and service my rv isn't possible. this is a good reference book for the do it yourselfer. very in depth and useful. highly recommended."
3,Good general reference book,It was a little dated for what I needed the book for. Some PM tasks are still pertinent as well as some test procedures for various troubleshooting issues.
5,Easy to understand,I purchased this book when I was strarting to look over a used RV I had just purchased. I soon was using the book to diagnose and fix a heater that wasn't working. The information is layed out in a clear and well ordered manner with good troubleshooting information. After reading the section I was able to quickly diagnose the wiring problem and everything is working great now.
4,Well prepared,Received the book within a short time frame. Well written and presented. Will carry in our r ec.vehicle at all times.
2,BIG FAN A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED,"I love the group Azucar Moreno and was waiting anxiously to hear this particular CD, but was a little bit disappointed with the outdated mixes and the selection of songs. The sound quality of the CD is also poor, not to mention that there are only 6 tracks. If you were as interested as I was to get this CD, I suggest you invest in another of their selections rather than this particular one."
4,In my opinion,"Tracks as follow.1. Soul Live-Hurry Up and Wait-4:052. Karl Denson-Dance Lessons No. 2-6:093. Medeski, Martin & Wood-Big Time-3:234. Dianne Reeves-I Remember Sarah-4:195. Marc Jordan-Slow Bombing the World-4:346. Jacky Terrasson-Les Chemins de L'amour-4:227. Patricia Barber-Bye Bye Blackbird-4:038. Stefano Dibattista-Johnny's Time-4:049. Cassandra Wilson & Dianne Reeves-Come Together-6:0710. Erik Truffaz-The Dawn Part 11-4:2211. Jane Bunnett-Journey Back-5:5812. Renee Rosnes-With A Little Help From My Friends-It's worth a listen. Includes some great artists."
4,Everything you need,If you need to replace your defective solenoid valve on a humidifier this kit provides everything you will need to get the job done.
1,Ripoff,"This was, apparently, partly the fault of my local NPR station which played an orchestral version of Schelomo Rhapsodie Hebraique. The station noted on its playlist the CD number from Dellos and that is what I purchased. What I actually received was this CD, a violin/piano performance. Here's the ripoff. The CD has just one track: Schelomo Rhapsodie Hebraique coming in at 21 minutes. NO OTHER MUSIC. What kind of CD is this??? One track? Thankfully I only payed ~$5 and shipping."
1,ughh.,"this hate is very small, i don't know how it's supposed to fit on someone's head! i thought beanie's were made to be loose. i guess i was wrong -.-"
5,"A brilliant selection of good songs, good voice","This is a great CD. Joe Cocker gives his all to each song, but my favorite is ""The Moon is a Harsh Mistress."" I've heard other versions but feel his voice tells the sadness of this song best. A great album."
4,Too cute for words!,"This is one of the cutest outfits and very soft/comfortable. My daughter looked great. My only complaint was the sizing was a little small, so one wash and a little shrinkage and already my 8 month old's feet are pushing out the froggies so it's tight. I recommend getting a size or two up from what you think you need so that you can enjoy your little one in this outfit much longer!! But a great value/cute find overall!!"
4,"I also like ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly""","This is a best of. I would call it a good introduction to the band. It has some good songs on it, mostly from ""Up on the Sun"" and ""Meat Puppets II"" but it also has a lot of other great stuff. I understand why songs that were not good enough to be on the original albums suddenly are classified to be on the ""best of"". I'm talking about songs like ""On the Move"", ""Burn the Honky Tonk Down"" and last last four songs - all fantastic. I also think that the mixture of punk, metal and country works well being on the same album together; Derrick Bostrom knew what he was doing when attempting to show the variety of the band's work. Songs like ""Looking at the Rain"" and ""Get on Down"" I find very cool and help to make this compilation a good listen. Blah blah *no 90s stuff* blah blah *personal preferences* blah blah. Buy it, it ain't too bad at all."
4,The early years.,"I'm not sure why they didn't release a career-spanning collection, but this one is pretty much just from the 80's. So nothing afterwards like the hit ""Backwater"", among others. But of course what's here is awesome, and it's remastered too. All the old stuff is sweet, so I won't pick those apart. The last 4 tracks are previously unreleased. The booklet also has a band history. So if you want a great intro to an influential band, get ""Classic Puppets"". It would go well with ""Too High To Die""."
2,yoo..,"This is not a best of, I wouldnt even call it a good introduction to the band. It has some good songs on it, mostly from ""Up on the sun"" and ""Meat puppets II"", but it also have a lot of lame stuff. I dont understand why songs that were not good enough to be on the albums originaly, suddenly classifies to be on the ""best of"". Im talking about songs like ""On the move"", ""Burn the honky tonk down"" and the last four songs. I also dont think that the mixture of punk, metal and country works on the same album, but I guess Derrick Bostrom just tries to show the variety of the band. Songs like ""Looking at the rain"" and ""Get on down"" I find very irritating and should not be on the album. Nothing from the 90's is on this album (because of legal reasons) which is a shame. ""Forbidden places"" and ""Too high to die"" are two of their best albums in my opinion."
4,"Sensible, Readable Introduction to the Stock Market","Leibowitz is a teenager with a sensible, cautious approach to the market. He explains concepts well and urges readers to invest for the long term, based on research not rumor. I don't understand the reviews that call this book dangerous--he's quite conservative in his advice and not at all oriented towards making a quick buck like you might expect for someone that young. This would be an excellent introduction to the market for someone totally unfamiliar with it, which is clearly who he thinks his audience is."
1,A Dangerous Book for Beginners,"Jay gives terrible advice. He has been in the market during a record bull market when it have been difficult to lose money. This appears to have led him to arrogantly believe that he is much smarter than a lot of other people who have much more experience in the market. Trust me, if it were this easy, everyone would be doing it. Follow the advice in this book and lose your money."
1,Eeeehhhh,"This book was not for Gen Y. The language was boring, there was too much hype and not enough substance, and basically I the book was written for 50-year-olds not my generation. If your in college or high school (or you're a parent buying a gift for someone that age) look for something that takes a look at investing from a more Gen Y perspective, something you can relate to. This book doesn't cut it."
4,Just beginning,"I've had my guitar for a year and could only play a few songs and a few chords because I didn't have sheet music to go by. I broke down and bought a few books, this being one of them. It has helped me tremendously. I was able to pick up on a few more chords and play many more songs. I was also able to easily change songs to a different key to make it more chord friendly and I just did that by playing around with the chords I know. It is definately a good book for beginners who are looking for the old time hymns and gospel songs. I now play my guitar almost everyday and with 2 toddlers that's not always easy, but I really enjoy being able to play songs and sing along."
5,Good starting point.,"I found this book to be a good resource for gospel music. For those needing repertoire to perform, it is filled with a large amount of music including many traditional tunes and gospel ""classics."" The music is a basic lead sheet with melody and chord progression listed above it. Being a novice into gospel repertoire, I found this book a good starting point."
5,Gospel's Greatest Fake Book,"I enjoy the variety of songs, but the scales are a little smaller than I am used to and I find myself straining to read some of the notes. Aside from this, playing the music is much easier than reading all the notes in both the treble and base lines."
5,reference material,This is a great reference fake book for gospel music. My favorite old time gospel songs are here.
4,Good Stuff!,"This is good stuff for beginners like me. Full of old time hymns. However, some songs isn't very Christian....like there's one from sound of music.The keys are somewhat unfriendly to a newbie like me...coz many songs are in Ab, Bb, Eb....well, just somemore things to learn!Gonna explore somemore since I just got the book 2 weeks ago!"
3,Underrated,"He does it again. Most underrated. Trully I can say half the albulm is hot. If your not a fan of any of Frukwan's previous packaging, this is not for U. Although frukwon does expand on his topics,he delivers that same punchy, choppy, 5% mix of marvel, he's been known for in the gravediggaz. For me a true undergroud lericis, he hit's the spot in hip hop, toching on subject the main stream scared to surface(plus he be singing his hooks).ez"
5,Novice interested in electronics,"I'm using this book as a self-study guide. It really starts from the basic assuming that you know nothing. I bought a locally printed edition of this book which costs US$20 which have an uglier cover, and I think it's worth more than that.You might need to struggle with it at first, but it's really worth it."
5,The Electronic Basics You Need To Know,"This is a classic for giving the basics of electronics to anyone interested in entering the field. I would classify it as a college level freshman or sophomore level introduction. It is simply one of the best! I personally purchased a new/old book, 4th edition. While some might think this means the material is dated, they would be wrong. The basics of electronics remain the same. A great supplement to Grob is the Tony R. Kuphaldt free e-book. The basics are what these books teach. If you want something shallow then get a book like ""Horn's Basic Electronics Theory!"" If you really want to learn something, get Grob.This text leads into Malvino's ""Electronic Principles."" In this case, I would suggest you get the most recent edition of Malvino's book, which is what I did. If you go through both of these books, you will be more than ready for practical application knowledge.Lou"
4,The Missing Link,This book is awesome. I was hired on as an apprentice with a local company and this book really helped out the novice. It's easy to understand even without formal instruction.
2,A Big Disappointment,"Basic Electronics, 8th Edition, was a big dispointment. I used an earilier edition of Grob in high school. I hardly recognized the book that I received in the mail. Half of each page is given over to pictures that have little or nothing do with the text, and at more than $80 it is over priced. I would recommend ""Practical Electronics of Inventors"" by Scherz instead."
3,"Competition, Rayman Style","In Rayman Arena, you compete to become the victor in two types of gameplaying: Races & Battles. In the Races, you will run, jump, and swing your way to the finish line while overcoming many obstacles on the way. In the Battles, you compete with other players in battles modes such as shooting weapons for KOs and capture the ""flag"".As you progress through the 1-Player mode, more features will be unlocked, such as new stages, new characters, and ways to alter the way characters look.In multi-player mode, you get to play with the characters you have found (5 original, 3 hidden) in the stages you have accessed (annoying for people who just play games for the multi-player modes).One of the things I didn't really care for in Rayman Arena is that in 1-Player mode, the challenges can get somewhat boring since the same challenges are in every stage. Also, the 1-Player mode is not very long.Let's put it this way: It's better to receive Rayman Arena as a gift than to buy it yourself."
4,Praise from a UCLA Extension Screenwriting Instructor,"""Marisa D'vari's Creating Characters gives the beginning screenwriter/novelist a set of useful tools, as well as some nifty tips on how to win over Hollywood's gatekeepers.""-- from Beverly Gray, UCLA Extension screenwriting instructor; former story editor for Concorde-New Horizons Pictures; author, Roger Corman: Blood-Sucking Vampires, Flesh-Eating Cockroaches, and Driller Killers"
1,Worst of the 2-3 dozen screenwriting books I've read,"This is far and away the worst book I've ever read. Amid the spelling and grammatical errors there were many poorly summarized/ plagiarized ideas from other people. The one original idea, the author's system of classifying characters, is totally counterproductive to creating interesting or unique characters. She suggests grouping ALL PEOPLE into 4 groups. I have read around 2 dozen books on screenwriting. They were all better."
4,Instant creativity tool kit!,"Like a lot of writers, I spend way too much time staring at a blank sheet of paper, wondering what characters are going to say to one another to further the action.In the first chapter, I learned how understanding the 4 basic personality types makes it easy to create scenes with the kind of tension and emotion that carries the story. What's most helpful are the colorful examples from popular films and books to support her points.Fun and valuable are the many creativity exercises that got my juices flowing and helped me better understand my characters and give them interesting quirks. The final chapter (Insider Secrets to Get Past the Gatekeeper) quotes a lot of publishing editors and script analysts giving great tips."
2,It could have been written by a Washington reporter,"I was really looking forward to reading this book. I was hoping for some inside information on how our political system works or more importantly, why our political system works the way it does. Instead, except for a few minor items, this book could have been written by a Washington reporter. It would also appear Ms Schroeder did not want to burn any bridges when she left as she said very little about the people she left behing in Washington. If you are looking for a book about politics, there are much better books out there."
1,Absolutely for Dullards,This is absolutely one of the dullest books ever written and one of the most boring. It is written by the dull for dullards.
1,Several hours of my life I'll never get back!,"I received this book as a graduation gift and while I was never a big fan of Pat Schroeder, I figured I'd give it a chance and see what she had to say. That was my first mistake, the second being reading the entire thing from cover to cover. The book is neither thought provoking nor intellectually stimulating and contains very little of substance. I got the distinct impression this was something she threw together over the course of a week in hopes of cashing in on her retirement from the U.S. House. Regardless of your political persuasion, you'll be wasting your money, and more importantly your time, if you purchase and read this book. ..."
1,THIS IS NOT GENE FROM KISS,PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS ARTIST IS NOT GENE SIMMONS FROM KISS!!DON'T BUY THIS BY MISTAKE OK!!P.S - KISS FOREVER!!!!!!!!
5,This CD is DOPE!!!,"disclaimer: marques is a friend of mine...but i swear on my life that i sincerely mean everything i say here.Deep is easily one of the best clubs in the country. There's a reason that DJ's like Little Louie Vega, Frankie Knuckles, Tony Humphries, Mark Farina, Timmy Regisford, Joe Claussell, and Miguel Migs (just to name a few) are regulars when they're in town. This CD captures the vibe of a typical night there perfectly...the only thing missing is the insanely positive vibes and crowd noise that you get if you actually go to the club. A super smooth mix with some amazing joints. Definitely pick up a copy.scott k.(...)"
3,Whirlwind by James Clavell,"I had ordered a new copy, which turned out to be an old, unread copy...that's not what I expected to find in the package. The pages were not damaged, but the cover and the book looked like it had been sitting in a store front window, for some time. Not sure if I'll be Amazoning again."
3,Dont buy this if you played THPS on other systems.,"Graphics are great, but the game play stinks. I had THPS 1 & 2 on Dreamcast, and the games rocked!!! I buy an X-box thinking it will be better, but it definately was not. Somebody thought changing the way the controller functioned would be a great idea.....well, they were wrong. It totally ruined the game. And you can't change the button configuration either. If you liked THPS on other systems, chances are you'll hate it on X-box."
4,Go for it....but only if you're part of the gaming minority.,"I only suggest you buy/rent this game if you: A- Are in possesion of an Xbox, and B- If you've never played Tony Hawks 1 & 2 before.I've never played Tony Hawk parts 1 & 2, so this was a great buy for me, however, I only have two complaints so far: Even though it's on Xbox, it still plays really slow when compared to Tony Hawk 3 for the PS2. The other complaint I have, would be the lack of pre-made button configurations(there's only one).So far, other than the two aforementioned flaws, I've been pretty pleased with this game."
3,THPS 2X,"Tony Hawk 2X is exactly what you expect -- an amazing translation of Tony Hawk1 and 2 with extra touches such as more detailed characters, and crisper textures and details on the environments. Unfortunately, because it's exactly what you expect, this isn't a game that can be recommended to everyone. If you haven't played Tony Hawk 1 or 2 on the other systems, AND you've just picked up an Xbox, then this is definitely worth your purchase. If you've already played the games on the other systems, AND don't own a GameCube or PS2 with which to play Tony Hawk 3, then this might be a game to consider for you launch package. But if you answered no to any of the above, this is probably not worth your money, unless you're a die-hard Tony Hawk completist that must own every version ever made. Despite the new additions, this just can't compete with the gameplay in NeverSoft's latest effort, no matter how polished."
2,Good but old,"The only way I ever suggest you to buy this game is if you've never played the one on Dreamcast, N64, or the Playstation. Sure, it's probably the most complete version of the game, but it's a sleeper hit in my opinion. If Tony Hawk 3 weren't coming out for the system, I'd suggest you get it, but since it is, I suggest you rent before a purchase."
5,When Tony Hawks Collide,"This game is definatelty looking to be greatness. All the level from Tony Hawk 1 and 2 with very revampes graphics. It also has 5 new levels. Its a shame the some will not buy this because Tony Kawk 3 is coming out close to the same date as it. This is assured to be one of the best games at launch, if it manages to stay a launch game that is. The graphics are very good, i havnt seen enough pictures to say amazing though. If you like other Tony Hawks than youll love this. Only people that do not like skateboarding games will not like this. I also hear that the grass flows in real time, which most people like me wont care about, but some people might. I am very eager to play this and see if it meets my expectations which im sure it will. I dont know if this is going to be better than Tony Hawk 3 or not, but i know that it has better graphics at least, plus its made by the same people, so they'll make the games equal and not be competing."
2,was good at first,when you first get this game it will seem awesome but as you play it more and more it will become tiring when you cannot open the next level and have no idea how you accomplish the goals it asks. Tony Hawk 4 is much better!
5,Tony Hawks Pro Skater 2 (Thps 2),"I really like the Tony Hawks Pro Skater series. I own Tony Hawks Pro Skater two for Nintendo 64, three for Playstation, and 4 for Xbox.I have cheats for all of them too. I am good at number 2 and 4."
4,"Good, not great.....","For a premire game, Tony Hawk 2x is pretty good. XBOX enables great graphics, and like all Tony Hawk games, it's fun. However, it's unique in it being a combination of Tony Hawk 1 & 2. This is why I don't care for it... The levels are ones I have already experienced on Dreamcast. So, if you can wait until Tony Hawk 3 comes out for XBOX, you should. It will not only have better graphics, new levels, and kewler features, it will also enable you to play your soundtracks during the game. It's worth the wait..."
1,HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA! HA!,HA! HA! you stupid people bought a x box instead of a playstation 2 and while i get tony hawk 3 you have to settle for tony hawk two and a half. HA HA :)
5,Country Blues CD,"This is one of the best overall crossection of original blues recordings I've found. The quality of the recordings appears to have been enhanced, and is as good as I've heard for these type of vintage tunes.I quite enjoy having either of these 2 CDs (2-CD Set) in my car CD Player. Especially enjoy hearing the Memphis Jug Band, Leadbelly, Tommy McClellan's Cross Cut Saw is worth the price of the entire 2-CD set!! I never tire of listening to it.Doc"
2,Unimpressive,"While the title implies this book will provide business specific memory skills, there is no original content here, and little to tie memory skills back to the business world.All material and facts have been covered in previous memory books (and often in much greater detail). Incorrect facts are also stated, e.g. ""We use less than 10% of our brain power"", a widely perpetuated myth which has been disproved many times.There are many other memory books out there with greater value."
1,Very Unhappy,"I bought the Intex air Mattress # 67731, twin size. There is nowhere to tuck in sheets and I don't know how anyone could sleep on it unless they use a sleeping bag. The sheets just slide all over. No one could be comfortable like this."
5,Better the 2nd time around,"I purchased one for my grand-daughter so she would have a high bed to sleep on when she visits us.We took her and the bed with us on vacation. She slept on it when we arrived and loved it. Others in the home where we vacationed saw it and were impressed with it as well.The easy electric pump quickly inflates and deflates. Before I left, I had another request to buy a 2nd bed.I actually purchased two more beds, one for the host, and another for my grandson.I had previously purchased a queen size Aero bed for well over $100.The Aero bed inflates okay, but to deflate it, you must squish the air out of it.With the Intex Deluxe Pillow Rest Airbed w/built in AC Pump, there is no squishing required. The bed inflates/deflates, by turning the dial, and pressing the button.You just sit back and let the pump do its work.A great investment for very little money!"
4,easey peasey lemon squeezy,"My son and I are living in a studio apartment for now and I sleep on a futon that is a sofa by day. There isn't a lot of room for another bed, so we purchased this inflatable bed for him. We love the ease of set up, the ease of deflating and the overall comfort of the mattress. He uses it every night, not just for temporary guests, etc. It's holding up nicely, and we've had no issues with anything. Having the pump IN the bed itself eliminates the hassle of having to plug in the pump separately (and store it separately!). The pump is relatively quiet, and fast. We inflate every night and deflate every morning and the bed rolls up and stays on a shelf. We haven't had issues with overnight deflation either, which we've had with every other inflatable mattress we've owned. Thank you for such a durable product."
1,LEAKS,"Junky Chinese quality - sprung a big leak after a few weeks of normal/moderate usage, also no instructions or warnings about over-inflating. Will try a different brand....."
1,Not the Husky in the picture,Very unhappy. I looked at the picture and it was spot on to the one my 2yr old cant be without. His is getting rather shabby and I was going to pull a switch. We already have 2 well now 3 of a dog that is much larger not as soft the fluff is missing from his inner ears which is a big deal to my son. I guess fleece just doesnt feel as good when hes snugglin and scratchin its ears at bedtime. So for me it was another loss but I have high hopes I will oneday find the one I need.
2,Not like the picture,"We have had one of these in the family since 2009, and finally gave in to requests for another. The one that was sent was not like the photo. The muzzle is made of different material and the eyes are different as well. We kept this one as at some point we will need one that is sterile, but we were able to get the original version on an auction site."
2,Disappointed child...,"I purchased two of the Slush toys for a Christmas gift, but only received one. Needless to say my nephew did not get a toy like his brother or sister...very disappointing to say the least."
5,girl's best friend,"I first bought tub-tub (slush)4 years ago then last year my daughter and i lost him in toy'r'us. we both cried because she never left the house without him, so a replacement was a must. A few months later, the ""new"" tub-tub now looks like the old one, happy and well played withand rarely left home. ps i would recommend a backup. (you never know)"
1,Dont Judge a book by its cover,Simply a waste of money. I was fooled by the cover the video is nothing but a few idiots video taping street fights using thier cell phones. This video sucks.
4,An exellent account of the ANV!,"Walter Taylor offers a great perspective into the charater of General Lee, the ability of his subordinates, and the fighting courage of the army itself. Taylor's book should be read by any Civil War buff since Taylor was actually there as Lee's adjutant general. While those critical of Lee may find Taylor to be too defensive and loyal to Lee, one can only continue to admire the Greatest General of the Civil War. I like to take in both sides of the issue concerning Lee, but I have found that Lee was an able, moral, and intelligent leader with weaknesses like every human. The only reason I didn't give this book a five is because of Taylor's subtle criticism of General Longstreet, while he does give him deserved credit."
3,Historical interest,"I am a bit new to the Civil War history ranks, but I have read several books over the last few years. I just completed Grant's memoirs, and decided I needed more information about Lee, hence this book. I could not rate it higher, due to the apparent inaccuracies (too many to detail, primarily with regard to numbers in the ranks and casualties), and the racist attitude that prevails. Taylor was clearly a loyal soldier, and true to his cause, but his mis-guided attack on General Longstreet became tiresome."
5,A Classic,"This game has been around for several years now, but remains one of the best combat games ever made. The graphics are fantastic, the game play is flawless, and the multi-player is top notch. In fact, the multi-player is why I purchased this copy. I hosted a HALO party where we had four TVs and four XBoxes hooked up with the system-link option. It was an absolute blast having 16 players in battling it out on the best combat game ever. I highly recommend it!"
3,Oh Man...,i want to know why everyone is so competitive about the games. You dont have to make fun of a game beacuse its not as good as other games. Unlike the first kid who wrote review for Halo i like both of them. I dont make fun of SOCOM or Halo.
5,A Breakthrough in Gaming,"Halo is an excellent game, without question the best game on the Xbox, without a doubt the best first person shooter ever, on any system, and quite possibly a contender for best game ever. Am I being over-the-top. Perhaps. But not since Metal Gear Solid (the original, on the Playstation), have I been so immersed in a game. The story is fantastic, with a twist that will shock you. And the story evolves in real time, as you play, as opposed to those irritating cut-scenes that have dominated so many games recently. The AI is super-intelligent, with the non-player-characters (NPC's for short) reacting realistically to your actions, friend and foe alike. I would (and did) buy the Xbox just to play this game. No regrets."
5,Great title for Xbox,This is a great game. The graphics and gameplay are top notch.Its obvious that the designers and Microsoft spent a lot of time on this game as they knew it would be key to early sales of the Xbox console. If you have a Xbox I would highly recommend this game.
4,Almost 3 stars...,"The hype on this game is unbelieveable. I'll put it this way: it's the best first person shooter I've played. That's only saying so much, though. FPS's can only be so good. You walk around, you shoot stuff, you pick up items. It has been the same since Wolfenstein and it will continue to be the same. The worst aspect of this particular FPS is that it is not on a PC. Keyboard and mouse are bar none the best way to play an FPS for control. Twin thumbsticks take some serious getting used to. Be prepared for that. I wanted to give this 3 stars, but I found myself replaying levels, so I'll be generous and give it 4. That is the beauty of a shooter. You can just sit down and play.BTW, the Warthog is a big pile."
5,Halo 1,This game is the best halo ever made and has the best campaign. I had so many good times on xbc on lan.
2,I don't get it,"This title is by no means bad, but I don't understand why people are acting like it's some sort of revolutionary game. It's an average first person shooter. There is nothing bad about it, but nothing great about it either. If you are a fan of first person shooters I would highly suggest this game, but if not, there is more fun to be had with other games."
2,Overrated FPS is mediocre.,"The Hype Machine. It creates heros and villans, and, in this case, grossly over hypes a mediocre 1st person shooter which was the only decent launch title for the xbox platform. Why would reviewers do this? Have you ever stopped to think about the revenue from Micro$oft and how many pages it buys in mainstream media outlets? It's huge my friends, so its not surprising to see this slightly better than avergae title get hyped beyond all belief.The controls are very good, game play is good, later levels get pretty boring/repetitive, and the graphics are good to very good.Try this game before you buy, please don't fall into the Hype Machine's wake. This game just aint all that."
2,Mediocre,"I usually don't write online reviews, but Halo warrents one. It's just another game. I wasn't impressed. The levels are highly repetitive and get boring quickly. I never finished this one, not because of the diffuculty, but because it gets old rather quickly. After a while all they do is throw enemies at you. I don't know how Halo got this big of a buzz. Honestly. Metroid Prime was a lot better. If you want to compare it to other FPS, Medal of Honor blows it away in every way. Including Multiplayer. I guess people believe what they are told. I'll be looking for Halo 2 to actually be good and live up to some of the overhype of the first one."
2,the game sux,"this game isn't that great. all you do is shoot stuff, and you beat the level. it's easy, and boring. hte only good part is the amazing multiplayer mode. but over all- i say it sucks. Metroid Prime for Nintendo Gamecube is a lot better. if you have a gamecube, get that instead"
3,Way overrated XBox Title,"This may be the best title for XBox, but it will only provide a small amount of fun to experienced FPS players. Me and my friend borrowed another friend's brand new XBOX to play HALO on my big screen, and we got about an hour into it before getting bored. There are only two or three different kinds of enemies. One of them runs away, and the other is much more powerful. Unfortunately, there isn't a huge variety of weapons in the game to keep it interesting, and the level design is sub-par comapred to say Unreal Tournament on the PC. The outdoor levels were better than the indoor levels, though, if that helps."
3,Makes me dizzy,"Halo and Halo 2 makes me dizzy when I play it. Maybe it's the running around for a long time doing nothing. I don't know why cuz Xbox Star Wars Republic Commando plays just find and I don't get sick. Republic Commmando is much more fun cuz you have squadmates and constant action. Halo is good cuz of co-op play though , unless your friends also get motion sickness from Halo."
5,Halo,"Halo is good of course, it is a lot of fun in multiplayer. especially when palyed of 5 or more.Here are the cons and prosPros:1.Good shooter2.Excellent multiplayerCons:1.some levels are repetitive2. few weapons"
4,Best Multiplayer Battle Game,"All my friend talked about Halo. I though it was [bad]. It sounded [bad] and seemed [pretend]. Then my friend got X-Box. He got 5 games. Those 5 games didn't include Halo (BIG mistake). My freind was thinking about selling his X-Box until he played Halo. He tolded me he rented it over the phone. THe next day I went over and played it. WOW WAS HALO AWSOME, NOT [bad], AND NOT [pretend]. It was sweet. At first I was awful at the game but I got better. I think the best part is riding the jeep and using that gun in the back seetWe had so much fun in the Coopertive play. 4 hours went by in a snap. Halo is the game to buy if you own X-box."
5,Best First Person Shooter since Half-life,This is a great Shooter due to the fact that not only Graphics are great but also extremly well balanced weapons and enemies. This game itself is already a good reason for buying a X-box
3,pretty good,"hmm i waited a couple of years after this was released to pick it up on pc, and i was not impressed. it was just another shooter. doom3 also seemed like...just another shooter. i was extremely impressed with half-life 2 however, but i really can't say what all the fuss was about with halo. i actually never finished it, despite being pretty far along in the game...i just got too bored with it."
5,WOW A GREAT GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,The game on xbox titled Halo on XBOX.Is a good game if you like to play shooting games this game has good graphics and also has a 1-4 player mode so you can play against your friends if you like action games then got this game.
5,Combat Stress Never Felt so Good,"To lavish any further praise on this game would be redundant at this point. Virtually every adjective of praise is deserved.Halo emphasizes the combat aspect of first person shooters, more than the exploration/fear elements in other games. The campaign mode constantly presents large groups of enemies that must be dealt with tactically; running in with all guns blazing will be a short-lived moment of glory in most cases. Sniping, effective use of cover and terrain, and exprimenting with different strategies are all part of the game. Teaming up with a friend on the campaign mode opens up even more tactical possibilites.The best part of the game is the multi-player, both the four player mode, and the capabilites with LAN and internet games. Finding a large group of Halo fans and playing a 16 person Halo LAN game on the Blood Gulch map is one of the most fun experiences a gamer could ask for."
5,Awesome!,"I have had this game for a while now and am almost finished with it. I have to say that is probably the best game i have ever owned. The controls are completly fluid and you feel as if you really are the Master Chief. Your computer buddies are also fight alongside you superbly and dont need any direction. And the balance between sneaking around and just charging in and firing away is great. I am definitly not a fan of this genre but i just cant stay away from this addicting game. No doubt, GAME OF THE YEAR!"
5,LET'S SEE................................GREATEST GAME EVER!,"How do you explain Halo? It is the greatest game ever created by man. It has unbelievable graphics and gameplay is awesome. It is a little hard to control at first but once you get the hang of the controls, there is no limit to what you can do. The multiplayer is pretty cool also. Just like Bond, you can play multiplayer in several levels and several game modes. You can also play with two, three or even four people. The cooperative gameplay is a lot of fun because if you can't beat a level, you can have a friend help you.IF YOU HAVE XBOX, BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!"
5,Halo is the best game ever made,Halo is the best game i have ever bought and I recomend this game to every one. It is worth every cent you pay for it. I was amased at the awsome graphics of the game. I was also impressed that the game could be played in campaign mode with two players. T he game also has beautiful to hostile environments. Also the alies you get in this game can actually kill enemys when in other games you could have 500 men and they would die before they even fired one shot. I could only find 1 thing that i did not like and that was that there where only a couple of levels like 9. The level though are about a half hour to a full hour long depending if you die. That is another thing I like when you die you go back to your last automatically saved spot instead of haveing to start from the begining of the level. This game all in all is one of the best games ever created and I definately give this game five stars.
5,Halo is a pleasing experience of killing and conquering,"Halo-you can play with as many players as you want.-Conquer Halo through many different extremes of hardship and damn can they get hard!-when you beat all of halo, you can still play the game as a turnamat(sp) with someone else, and what can be more fun than the hunt and kill game with many many different levels and testssuch as races, king of hill, hunt and kill, and much more-many surprizes will come about, i love it when an AI comes out and scares the crap out of youHalo doesnt give the mind a very hard work out, but reflects are given a good work out.I enjoyed this game very very much. Some thing a gamer should buy, beat and come back later and pick up and play again"
5,Best First Person Shooter!,"This is the best FPS I've played. The beautiful graphics and the incredibly intelligent AI are the most amazing features of this game. The weapons and vehicles are all varied (somewhat) and give a unique experience.The biggest problem with this game is that some of the levels are EXTREMELY repetitive, especially the ones that take place indoors. But I feel that the first time you play through this game, it's going to be a great experience! (And don't forget to check out the co-op mode, it's the best!!!)"
5,greatest,"without a doubt, this is the greatest game ever made. xbox version has no flaws and is always fun and enjoyable."
4,Grossly overrated (Blasphemy!) but still a good game,"This is not the best game ever made. It's a good game with many nice touches: multidimensional NPCs, graphic details, pretty weapons and vehicles. But the basic fact is it's just a first-person-shooter like ""Return to Castle Wolfenstein"", ""Half Life"", ""Doom"" and a legion of others. The story is intriguing, spawning weak novels. This game has created a very large loyal army of fanatic followers (or vice versa). Beyond the hype, make no mistake this is a very enjoyable game, very much worth the money. But the replayability wears very thin after a while then it becomes another game on the shelf."
3,more challanging then it has to be.,"this game is fun however in the same way Ninja Gaiden was when i beat i didnt feel like i accomplished anything other than breaking 50 controllers. when i got the part where i ""follow the monitor to the index"". the game pretty much got impossible. i liked halo 2 better, it was challanging but not to the point where it got too frustrating."
4,Definitely creme de la creme,"I was never a big fan of FPS games, mainly because of the wave of nausia that I get by moving my character around (stop laughing at me), But I had no clue that the gaming experience in this game was so great, that I didn't even care that the room was spinning after playing for 3 hours. The graphics are great, the story line grabs you and doesn't let go (The Halo prequel novel is available, too), the control is responsive and not too sensitive and there are plenty of multiplayer options available to play or to edit. My only complaints about the game are as follows:1: not including grenades, you can only carry 2 weapons at a time.2: Not as many vehicles as I would have liked to have at my disposal.3: Not that many weapons (but all of them are sweet)If you like a good storyline, great graphics, and a game that you just won't be able to put down for days, Halo is a great pick."
5,One of the best games I ever played,I bought this game over four years ago and just have to say I must of replayed this game at least a dozen times (Start-Finish). This game was one of the major reasons I bought an Xbox then an Xbox 360. If you like to play shooters this game is for you.The graphics even by today's standards are very good. The campaign is best thought out story I have ever seen even better than movies. The only thing this game lacks is online play but this game was released just before Xbox Live came out. If you want to play online get the PC version or buy Halo 2. Once you beat this game get Halo 2 it was also an extremely good game. Halo 3 will be on sale for the Xbox 360 in a year hopefully less.
5,Great Game,This is a great game!!! I haven't played a game where i got really involved in it for a long time. My friend and i played the two player campaign last night for hours. Its alot of fun and probably the best game of its type i have played lately.
4,Lives up to the hype...,"I am a late comer to the XBox craze being an avid PS player for years. Recently bought a 360 and immediately decided the Halo trilogy was going to be in my collection ASAP. I remember the fanfare this game got back in '01 when the system launched and I can honestly say it was well deserved.I've been playing the Halo games for a couple years now and have always been wowed by the multiplayer aspect but now that I've gotten into the campaign, I'm blown away by the attention to detail. Great visuals, story and sound. One of the best launch titles ever.- MikeStan"
3,Halo opinions vary,"Halo is still concidered by many to be the best title for XBox. I do not agree. While Halo is arguably the best launch title for any console ever released, it simply has been bettered many times since launch. Many who bought their XBox and Halo together are reluctant to admit that Halo is good, but not great as Halo is the game that gave them the XBox that they love. It is a good game, just not great. Levels are repetitive, the enemy AI is weak and works more on overwhelming by force than by tactics, and the vehicle control is strange at best, a detriment at worst. Halo brings nothing new to the FPS style, and by now, things have been done better more than once. I am not a Halo hater, I actually enjoy reading the books more than playing the game. Halo 2 shows promise at the time of this review, but it is still a ways out."
2,Ok.....overrated,"The hype surrounding Halo was enormous. The game itself provides enormous dissappointment. The single player game is easy, boring and non-descript. I didn't get giddy playing it (the sign of a great game) and it's awkward vehicle control and long spaces of no action were awful. The multiplayer is what saves this game. It's pretty cool, but I think a lot of the levels repeat the same things over and over, meaning the architecture DOESN'T change...so its just the same level with different textures. Don't buy it, rent it twice and get your money's worth.I already sold my Xbox and bought a much better machine. A Gamecube. Thanks"
1,junk,i was not impressed by this game at all n64 was alot better than this game if you want a real game go get a gamecube halo didnt have that great of graphics either
1,Holy crap this game sucks,"What the heck does everybody think is so good about this pile of steaming dung? The graphics are good, okay, but everything else about it is boring. The levels- boring. The gameplay- boring, I mean WTF you can only carry 2 guns at a time? That sucks. I'm all for realism, but not if the realism bogs down the game itself! All the enemies look the same, the driving sucks, its just... blah. If you want a good game go buy Grand Theft Auto: Vice City."
1,this game is horrible!!!!!!!,If you wan to get xbox then you might as well buy a carboard tv from a hobo so you can play xbox on it and it won't make a difference if it was on a working tv. Halo has horrible graphics which even luigi's mansion (which was actually a pretty good game) could beat. I wish i could have given this game less but it only went down to one star. In conclusion: buy Nintendo the REAL gaming company and send Bill gates back top his little computer company or whatever he does.
5,The best 1st person shooter to date.,"If you are one of those unfortunate souls who hasn't played Halo, BUY IT NOW! This game alone justifies the purchase of an Xbox. The game has stunning graphics, exciting gameplay, and a fanstastic plot. Multi-player action provides hours of additional play on top of the single player game. There are a couple levels (out of 10) that get a bit tedious, but that is really my only criticism. Averything else is masterfully done."
2,What's the big deal?,"I finally got a chance to play this when a visiting cousin brought his X-Box. I played both the multiplayer and singleplayer functions, and..I really don't see why there's so much hype over this game. I really don't. I gave up after the third mission because I found myself bored half to death. Even the stunning graphics couldn't salvage the game for me.In the missions that I played, nearly every area had the layout and feel of a glorified, overblown deathmatch level with repetitive twists and turns. The controls were clunky and I simply could not adjust to them no matter what setup I tried.This review may not be any help to potential buyers of this title, but I just had to come out and say that I simply do not understand why this game is so insanely popular."
2,"Man, These Marines Are Slow","Ever wished that James Bond was wearing concrete boots in Goldeneye? Well, Bungie has made this fantasy a reality with Halo. Don't worry about falling out of your seat; Halo keeps the gameplay at a crawl...Not much fun, but a great way to ease into siesta."
2,This Game Is Not All That And A Bag Of Potato Chips,"Halo is stupid,it took me little to no time to beat the stupid game. The graphics are good, but it is too darn easy. Theres no point to the game thats why i give this game 2 stars"
5,Best XBOX game,"I really didn't know how good Halo was until I played James Bond AuF. James Bond is a good game but Halo is better in every single aspect. Specifically, I think it's the feel of the weapons as much as anything else. They just feel right in my cyborg's hands. The bullet speed and rate of fire are realistic and still the game is so hard. Credit to the awesome AI which actually knows how to duck,retreat,regruop, recover and then outflank and kill me if I'm nnot careful. For the weapons, there's the zooming pistol, machine gun, shotgun, sniper rifle, and rocket launcher, and standard grenade for the humans. The aliens have some weapons but they're all plasma weapons so they are not as much fun to use. The needle gun is really only good for killing tank sargeants when in multiplayer mode. The best game ever made and the only game I know to let me use my machinegun as a sledgehammer when I run out of bullets in the middle of a firefight."
5,Halo is awesome,"Halo is the most awesome game i've ever played, great story, great graphics, great characters, it has the makings of a winner and it is. Can't wait for Halo 2 in fall of 2003."
5,one word- SENSATIONAL,"Halo is the one game that XBOX can brag about even if it goes bankrupt in a year from now(like that will ever happen with Bill Gates). The graphics are not so hot when you first get it. Then when you get into campaign mode and you look at the details on the grunts, you realize that this game is wicked cool. After this sensation, you will be wanting to play this game non-stop. It is one of the greatest moments on xbox when you beat halo under legendary. After that challenge, you still have half of the fun left: multi-player which is brilliant. You could just get halo for the multi-player action. There is nothing more fun than killing your friends right when he is entering a tank with the flag for a protected ride back to their base. Halo is the game of the year and anyone who doesn't agree, either hasn't played the game or is mentally crazy."
4,King of all games,"Through time theres been great games such as resident evil, final fantasy, and metal gear solid. But Halo is somethin else. It takes place on the world of Halo most of the game. Its you versus the covenant, or what most would consider an alien species. You fight and kill, then you fight and kill some more, then comes vehicles. Each vehicles is unique and makes you say ... YEAH! when you notice you can drive one. But then again there are some downs and ups in the game...Pros--great gamplay, long and fun-good graphics-awesome vehicles and weapons-multiplayer mode kicks major [tail]Cons--not enough weapons-not a big enough variety of aliens-some levels get boring.-your marines are not the smartest of peopleOthere than that the game is great. Its exspensive but it's deffinetly worth the price."
1,Terrible piece of junk on a piece of junk system,This ame is terrible just terrible..it's just an average shooting game but only it has the WORST controls [it takes a joystick and a button to climb a ladder]..and the graphics are bad...it's just plain bad
2,A highly overrated game,"I played Halo at my friends house, and let me say that though the game is pretty fun, it gets boring after a while. When I heard about this game, I thought a game where you shoot aliens would be awesome. First of all, the stupid aliens take about 2 minutes each to kill, and if you don't already throw away the game in disgust, you are in for more. The aliens don't even really bleed, and I am a person who loves bloody games. The game is mature and I want blood and gore! The idea of the game is good. The graphics are also okay I guess, but Ps2 is better than X-Box."
1,Pointless,This game is stupid theres no point or story to the game all you do is go around shooting alians and watching them blow up. Kids say the game rules when they havn't even played it. One question why is the game rated M and got best game of 2003 if it's so babyish? If you like this game your a big stupid idoit who likes chickens! THIS GAME SUCKS PLAY SONIC INSTED!
2,HALO = Overhyped,"I played this game at the E3 expo earlier in the year. It would have been very pretty if it had a consistent framerate, but that's something that I hope will have been cleared up by the time they release. Of more concern is the gameplay - I don't understand why this game has been hyped so much. The controls were horrible. First person shooters simply are not playable with a console joypad. Hyping the game and saying they've ""optimized"" the controls does not fix the fact that you can't move and aim properly without a PC-style mouse and keyboard. Since it's not even out yet I refuse to give it a 1 star rating - but please rent before buying. Note: This probably isn't one for the kids given it's rather violent content."
2,A very rushed poorly done game...,I'm sorry...i just didnt think this game was that great out of what i played of it.Poor graphics and very reppetitive.May appeal to some gamers...just not me.Im not trying to tell you to buy it or not.Im just saying my opinion
2,"Good graphics, nothing much else:","This was my first game I bought with my Xbox (along with one more). At first it looked great, but then I heard cuss words in it. The graphics are good, but I think James Bond: Agent Under Fire's graphics are better and more realistic. This game would be a good game if it didn't have so much gore and vulgar language in it. Many parents are being duped into buying this game for their kids, not nowing how the language is, even though it does say ""Mature"" on it. I would suggest not playing this game mainly because of its content and unrealistic nature. (PS: After I bought Halo, I returned it the next week)."
1,Halo is nothing,"Half-Life & RedFaction is 1,000,000 times better than Halo in every way. The reason why all these people are saying good things about is that microsoft payed them off."
1,worst fps for the worst system,"this game isn't as good as people say, 10 out of 10 is wrong this game has got to be the worst fps i have ever played the graphics are just like metroid primes, the controls are the worst since you have xboxes big control tat ain't even comfortable. if u want a good fps get metroid prime. i don't own xbox but my friend does and i play it over there. wat i do own is a gamecube and ps2 and i also own metroid prime and metroid prime is so much better than halo. halo's single player is horrible. i don't know how this game got 10 out of 10 but to me its a -10 out of 10 be leive me don't get xbox don't get halo."
5,"Very Good, but short.","Excellent gameplay, and story. Graphics are amazing, better than Game Cube or PS2. If you own an xbox or are thinking of getting one,this is the best. The only flaw is the length, short and sweet, but there is probably going to be a sequal.Put this one in your cart."
3,Not as amazing as everyone says,"The campaign starts off alright, and when the game opens up to wide expanses it's great fun, but otherwise it's a bland corridor shooter with repeating environments and little to break up the monotony. To be fair, it might get better near the end, but I just couldn't get myself to finish the Library. I tried it a few times, and realized that I wasn't having any fun so I put this game away and haven't touched it since. The muliplayer can be fun, but too many of the maps are either way too big unless you're having a lan party, or just plain stupid (such as the one with stupid amounts of teleporters).To be fair, this is an important game, and redefined the console FPS genre, but unless you're interested in the history of videogames, you'd be better off playing a more recent Halo game, such as Reach, which I found to be one of my favorite games last year"
3,Stick with the 360 titles,I got into Halo under the 360 platform and decided to play the originals for their story. The game considering its 9 years old is good but after playing the newer titles it's hard to play this one with the same enthusiasm given the numerous repetitive cycles on the levels (i'm speaking of the campaign). One level in particualar was overkill (Library) where you play thru the exact same course over and over and over again. In the hierarchy of Halo games this one is definitely at the bottom of the list.
5,"You can kiss 007 and PD goodbye, because here comes Halo","This game is better then any 007 game and PD. The graphics and gameplay are one of a kind. The expanse levels and fabulous multiplayer make this game a must have for any Xbox. The storyline and nonstop action make you never want to stop playing. Right from the start it pulls you in to the beatifully designed levels and memorible gameplay, that only can be found in the world of Halo."
5,console seller,"If you are debating about buying this game, just know that is has been the main reason many people have even bought the xbox. It was for me...-Chris-Buy it, it's worth the $20 by far..."
5,HALO is the best x-box game,You have to be totally burned out not to like Halo. It is the best game I have ever played!! Bar none!! You can't knock any aspect of it! Its all I want to play! Period!!
5,GO HALO!!!!!!!!!,"HALO IS A VERY GOOD GAME. YOU CAN DO COMBAT ON GROUND AND AIR.YOU GET WEAPONS SUCH AS SHOTGUNS,HANDGUNS,ROCKET LAUNCHERS, MACHINE GUNS AND OTHER ALIEN GUNS. YOU CAN DO MULTI PLAYER VS. THE ALIENS AND YOUR FRIENDS. MANY MULI PLAYER OPTIIONS. MANY LEVELS TAKE A LONG TIME TO BEAT. OVER ALL IT'S ONE OF THE BEST GAMES I'VE EVER PLAYED. ANY PERSON THAT OWNS AN XBOX SHOULD GET ONE."
5,Halo Review,"This is simply the greatest game I've ever played. It has great graphics, and amusing plot, and aliens as enemies that are fun to destroy. Realistic and fast flying alien crafts, as well as dominating battle tanks, make it fun to move around its incredible levels. Explosive guns and grenades give this game the futuristic edge the designers wanted. Multiplayer games that can be altered to fit the players style, and can also be hooked up to play against other players miles away, make Halo an addictive and fun game. This game is great for all types of gamers, but get get a little gory for younger players. I suggest you go ahead now and BUY THIS GAME! ITS WORTH EVERY PENNY!"
4,Halo: The Best FPS out there......Until Halo2,"Out of all the FPS' I've played, this is THE DEFINITIVE game for any console ever made.Halo's campaign mode is one of the best out there.I would know. I've beat it in Legendary. The game puts you in instant action as you fight off hundreds of Covenant troopers on the ship you get ""thawed out"" on. The game stays strong with: intense fire-fights, exceptional AI, a wide variety of weapons, and some of the best multiplayer modes since Goldeneye 007 on the N64. Where the game slows down (literaly) is when you come across a checkpoint, and the games auto-save feature kicks in( very anoying when your trying to snipe something). Other than that and the lack of Banshee's in multiplayer, Halo: Combat Evolved will keep you coming back for more even after you've beaten it several times. It deserves every bit of a 5...out of 5."
4,MUST HAVE (FPS) GAME,"Halo raises the bar on FPS ,solid game .But its too short I rented it and beat it in 4 days.The reason to own this game is for the multiplayer. I wish all FPS woud use HALO'S game design .Im sure HALO 2 will raise the bar again.Lets hope. If you liked GOLDENEYE 007 , this game is a must."
3,Good.....yet tough.,"This game is pretty awesome,pretty gory, and pretty fun, but I went over to a friend's house to play it(for the first time), and it was hard! My friend is good at it but if you are a person who is a slow learnrer at mildly tough video games, you need to find something easier."
4,"Summer 2008, Has Halo I aged like an egg or a fine wine?","I've played most of Halo I by now. It reminds me of the Metroid I had in the super Nintendo. Only that MS made it 3D. Think about it, a guy in an astronaut suit, and killing weird aliens in other planets. The music is mysterious, Metroid like too. I'm sure the Metroid in 3D in Nintendo GC offers more variety, with monster at the end of a level, etc. Anyway, Halo I also has Quake II stuff; the walls and futuristic things are reminiscent of Quake. Nothing original about Halo I. However, it shines in the control precision and smoothness. The game is 7 years old now. Nothing better than playing a game after many years to see if it got rotten like an egg or aged like a fine wine. The graphics look primitive, but it's the controls and the shooting experienced where the game really stands out and stood the test of time. All in all, the game feels too empty and boring to be fun, but the controls are the best I've seen."
3,Buy the PC version,I recently bought this game after losing the PC version. I was extremely disapointed to find out IT HAD NO ONLINE PLAY and had a lot less maps than the PC version. The game felt very limited compared to the PC version. I know its a classic but if you have a decent computer you should skip this and buy the version for the computer.
4,Great 1st person shooter,This game plays almost as good as the new Halo3 game. I can see why this game is so popular its a very good 1st person shooter. well worth the $10 I payed for it.
2,HUH?,"I don't see what's all the hype is all about, I'm a home console gamer so I guess it's a PC thing for PC fans (Xbox)."
1,Wait for the PC version,"The PC version should be along a little while after the X-Box version, and it will be worth the wait. Everything will be better in the full-blown PC version, for which the game was originally designed. Also, you can know that you are not supporting Microsoft! Bungie developed this game, and they were long time mac(pc) developers, but got bought out by Microsoft for the X-Box launch. You can buy a better PC for the price of an X-Box almost... This will hopefully follow on Bungie's Myth 2, which is probably the best online multi-player game of all time, esp with the WW2 conversion."
1,Not all it's cracked up to be...,"When I first looked at Halo, I thought, cool! But boy was I wrong!!! Microsoft should stick with computer games for computers, instead of trying to invade the console community. Here are my ratings(out of 10)Music-5Graphics-9Controls-3Replay Value-0Content-2 (For a mulitplayer game, it has way too much violence. Duke Nukem and Quake have already used up this idea.)So as you can see Halo is nothing more than flashy lights and neat environments. Definitely rent before you buy."
4,Some helpful info,"First and formost...I love Halo. The graphics are FANTASTIC, the sound is excelent, and the gameplay is fast-paced and addictive. There are some drawbacks though. The controls are hard to learn (but after you do, they offer incredible freedom), and the plot isn't as good as it could be. These cons aside, I suggest that anyone looking for a great shooter (both single and multiplayer) should get Halo as soon as they can."
3,A tired shooter for the XBox...,"It's sad when the only thing good about a game is the multiplayer. After playing the single player for ""Halo"" for about an hour, I got bored. The game is recycled bits from other action games only with a nicer look. And the controls are terrible in this game. No surprise, since the controller for the XBox is a clumsy [look-a-like] of every controller for every other system. XBox the best system? Please. If this is the best they can do, I rate them just under Sega's Dreamcast, and barely above the Atari Jaguar. XBox is bound to fall into video game history as a bland attempt from an American company to make video games. Nintendo's Virtual Boy was better than this."
1,The worst game on the earth.,This game stinks and for all of you people that like it you are morons. The gamecube and ps2 will always be better than a big black ugly box made by bill gates that has mental issues. Metroid Prime and Kingdom Hearts are the best games on this generation of consoles.
1,Ummm... no,"This game is, simply put, not good. I got bored to tears playing it, then ended up giving it away because it was robbing useful space on my desk. It is slow-paced, predictable, and not suspenseful at all. In fact, these characteristics are probably why it's so mainstream, even though it's laughable in comparison to real first-person shooters, which by the way don't even belong on consoles. Owning at this game means you are an average player. Any true FPS gamer knows what childish, pathetic garbage this is, while the rest just go with the hype. Many have successfully deceived themselves into thinking it's worth anything at all. It isn't."
5,Its the bomb,"Its the bomb its sooooo much fun to play i play it every day! You can play with a friend or you can battle your friend. Its got shotguns all the way to rocket lanchers. You can drive jeeps, tanks, huver crafts,to flying things!"
5,best game ever,this game rules over any kind of other game. if i had a choice to get a ps2 or xbox i would do the same thing and get my box...this game plus halo 2 when it comes out on 8/1/03 (plus i am gettinga copy the first day hahahaha) make xobx the thing to own
4,Great Game,Great game for a great console. Some of the stages get a tad bit convoluted and might turn out to be a bit frustrating. Overall an excellent first person kind of game. Worth the money.
1,HALO,I do not know how much fun this game is because it is not compatiable with XBox360!!!! It will not work!!!
1,Very disappointed,"As the title says, I am extremely disappointed. Not only did the game arrive damaged and unplayable, but since lodging 2 complaints, nothing has been done to rectify the problem. I will not be using the client who sold me this game again."
1,good for only one thing killing!,yeah it's a good game if all you want to do is go around killing aliens. there is no skill at all involved in this game it is dam near impossible to die and even if you manage to die u start in practically the same spot you left off in. there in no stelth or skill tactics involved what so ever the game is simple and at times easier than a mario game.
1,Not up to par,"I am veteran Halo player from the XBOX version of the game. I got the PC version so I could play with more than 4 people on the multiplayer portion of the game. The PC version was a great dissapointment. For some unknown reason PC Halo is not compatable with some AMD chipsets, mine being one of them. After spending a week searching for drivers that might fix the problem I got the game to work, but it was incredibly unstable. Typical game play was with poor graphics that would usually crash my system after about 20 minutes. The moral of this story is.....if you have XBOX Halo you are better off getting XBOX live than spending $50 on the PC version."
1,I was mis-led,"I bought a used xbox just a few weeks ago. Now we all heard that Halo is a must have, so natrually I ordered a copy of this also. WHen I first played the first level, it was descent. But after the 3rd level, I honestly just stopped playing. Not only is there an ENOURMOUS amount of back tracking, but no map. I cant begin to tell you the furustration I had/have. I honestly never completed this game. I stopped after the level called 'the flood.' I guess the rumors of microsoft paying off reviewers is true!"
5,It'll Be a Classic,"Halo's gonna be a classic. Halo: Combat Evolved is arguably one of the best fps,no, best games ever made. You are Master Chief/John 117 in a long battled war against a colorful race of aliens called Covenant. You land on a planet shaped like a ring called Halo and the primary goal is to destroy the covenant. I've enjoy many long nights playing Halo til my thumbs hurt, and they never hurt.(HEH HEH) The game is so realistic that you can sneak up an enemy and kill him quietly with a hit it the back. In cooperation you can have one player distract an enemy and one shoot it and you can do tricks with the jeep like pile up grenades, and park the jeep ontop and blow em up.... The jeep'll soar(Not aadvertised but adds replay value to the game.)The only complaints i have is the lack of stages and the default controls but you can change them.... Other than that, this game cant go wrong. There's a real deep story line so pay attention,also."
5,::Halo Owns::,"XBOX owns one of the best and perhaps to what is the best first person shooter out there. Then again im not suprised that Gamecube and PS2 owners feel left out because their weak little systems cant support these types of games! HAHAHAHAHAHA, anyway ive seen suprisingly alot of bad reviews about this game...and suprisingly they all come from JEALOUS Gamecube and PS2 owners.Sorry guys, but the XBOX owns for the next 4 years to come.Just wait until HALO 2 comes out next year, then you gamecube and ps2 owners will be on your knees crying!"
5,Love it!,"I bought this to complete my Halo collection... love it, there ain't nothing better than going back to the oldies. Good price and good condition!"
5,Lucky,"I bought this for cheap so was expecting just the game. What I received really impressed me. Besides the case being in almost perfect conditon there was not one scratch, nick, or ding on the game itself. Also it had the orignal complete booklet. Love the company will definitley buy from them again!"
5,Delivered as described in description,The product was actually in better condition than was described and was exactly what i was looking for. Great Product.
4,"Good clasic game, really enjoyable!","This game never gets old, I enjoyed it when it first released and I enjoy it today! Was nice to get it cheap and reliable through amazon gaurenteed. Good buisness."
5,Greatest Game Ever PLAYED,"The best game I have ever played! You Play as MASTER CHIEF,a geneticlly enhanced human. You land on the mystyrious Ring world HALO. There you fight the covenant and flood. Great Storyline and great gameplay. And multiplayer is also great. There was about 40 hrs. of gameplay. So if you have an xbox and no HALO you better get it. P.S.Icannot wait for halo 2"
4,~Good quality alien shoot em up!!,"This is a good game even though im not usually into those games with all the aliens and stuff in 'em. The best part of this game is the multiplayer it is awesome, and provides hours, if not days!!(just kidding) of challenging fun. The single player in my opinion could be better though, theres not a lot of story behind it."
5,Addictive,"This is the reason to buy XBox instead of PS2! The awesome life like graphics, stunnin 3D worlds, and effective sounds will draw you in for hours. This game is great for any skill level because you can set the smartness of the aliens attacking you.This is one of the best multiplayer games that I have ever played! You can play against each other (up to 16 players!) with all kinds of senarios, (capture the flag, rat race, etc.) or you can even create your own! But the think that I like the most, is the fact that you can play the one-player mode with multiplayers! (up to 4) You can get together with your friends and play the standard game, and whip some alien ... This game rocks!"
3,good game but has some down flaws,first off it is a pretty good game but it has some down flaws.one of them is there isnt damage on the warthog or the tank i mean like if shoot a tank or a warthog with any weapon it doesnt even put a scartch on them that takes realistic out of the game.The other one is the warthog never runs out of ammo that takes even more realistic out of the game.i hope halo 2 is better.good game but its dissapointing on the realistic stuff.
2,COMBAT evolved my @$$!,"This game is supposed to be about combat,not about chasing migit sized,blue blooded alien wannabees!(which is alot of fun I might add,especially with the warthog!)This game only turns on 30 not 60,providing you with a half boring game,25%slow gameplay experiance,and 25% of awsome weapons...but with extremly low fire rates,ding dong the witch is dead!Now the highlight of this title is clearly(to me)the vehicles.In how many games can you just pull up and the military will jump on and help you?(I wish i could drive a warthog down the street amd women would get in,sensational!OH COME ON IM HITTIN PUBERTY!!)well thats it I hope that you will heed this(hopefully)helpfull review and get HALO 2 instead,if you havnt already and steer clear of this one!"
2,Ive grown to hate this game,I year ago I would have given this game five stars. But now it seems so lame even in multiplayer. Why cant they make a download for it that makes it live compatible. That would help revive it. Im tired of waiting for halo 2.
3,"Its good, but its not that good!","I'd like to keep this review short since I'm low on time, but anyway...I found this to be a good game, but it was kind of a let down after playing Metal Gear Solid 2. Its just not in the same league. If you have a PS2 and don't have MGS2, that is the game you want to buy. After MGS2, buy this one."
2,What is the Hype???,"In a word, save your money. This game is not worth the hoopla. Its a good rental but two people can beat the game in an afternoon...on easy of course. Like all the Xbox games, the graphics are great, but the game play is bad. I found myself going back to my N64 to play James Bond for my role playing fix because you can have more guns."
2,I dont know why people like this,"i dont like halo because its just not my kind of game. The weapons are nice enough but the gameplay is just plain boring. Plus the blood is purple which is dumb. If you want a realistic shooter, than buy Rainbow Six 3, the multi-player is boring too and the story is dumb. Dont buy this and play Rainbow Six 3 which is more realistic and better."
5,Halo Review,"First of all, I have already beaten the game and it is awesome. I will write this review under multiple categories.GRAPHICS- The graphics are excellent. This part of the game makes you feel like you are really involved in the action.GAMEPLAY- This is very good. I have a few suggestions. I think that you should be capable of having more than two different guns at one time. Also a few more levels would be great. Last, on multiplayer, I think you should be able to team up with two players against two computer players instead of having to play against each other. This will help for teamwork in the co-op missions.I also would like to be able to save in a few more spots instead of having to beat the entire level."
5,Best.Game.Ever,"Period.This game played on the level one higher than normal is a real challenge both for the reflexes and the mind. In many scenerios it is possible to outwit the opponents and avoid the shoot-em-up all together. At the higher level, that level of thought is necessary to progress on some levels."
4,grows on you,"Game of the year? Please! No doubt this this great looking game has kept so many people facinated and was the sole reason for millions of X-Box purchases, but it doesnt deserve that status. It looks great, dont get me wrong. The vast landscapes are astounding, but ina first person shooter, you shoulnd't be too interested in a nature walk. But that's what you'll get. The level in this game are vast, sprawling, hour-long enterprises, and at times. But Bungie hasnt cut any corners with the story (the books should make that obvious by now) and the story adds weight to the gameplay. But still, it looks good, it is good, and although it may not set a standard for FPS like Perfect Dark did, I'd say it's worth it for serious gamers with time on their hands. And I should mention that an 8 player deathmatch is the best thing to happen to non-drinking parties since fooseball"
5,"Nothing less than absolute perfection, maybe more.","Halo is without a doubt the best game to some along since the beginning of video games in general. Anyone who dares to insult it should not be allowed to live, and i know im backed up by millions of gamers on that statement. It is ABSOLUTE PERFECTION, nothing less. The enemy and ally AI is exceptional. There are enough weapons, vehicles, Covenant, Flood, perfect gen. graphics, and multiplayer battles to keep anyone entertained for years on end. The levels are perfect. The idea of fighting along side you fellow soldiers is captured....perfectly. The pounding soundtrack keeps your heart racing, then again so does the silence. How many games can accomplish that? Halo is perfect in every aspect, baring none.We can only hope that no one dies of a heart attack when Halo 2 hits, but i wouldnt be surprised."
3,"Good Game, but not the greatest","This is a good game, that's about it. Its certainly not the best game ever, but its probably one of the best FSP's out there. For $50 its kinda pricey for like, the first xbox game...ever, but its still a really good shooter. For the old schoolers who say that ""Goldeneye 007"" is better than this game, yah ur wrong, it was for sure a wicked game, but u probably haven't played it lately cus compared to this game its not as good. 007 was a classic but objectively, this game is better. But this game is really good, Halo 2 will be amazing, but PS2 has better games than xbox, and xbox is just starting to pump out really good games but The PS2 has been doing that ever since it was made."
3,Certainly overhyped,"Sure, this game has had rave reviews, and I'm basing this on games released in the same time period.Yes, there is a story. It's a fairly decent setup, but after the initial training, it's simply, ""kill the aliens and save the marines"" missions. It gets pretty old, pretty fast. Of course, the second one was supposed to be a lot better. We'll see, when I get to that. It works really well on the xbox 360, as I would have guessed, since this was their flagship title for the first xbox. It is available for download, but I like to have physical media, since you never know when their virtual store may not be available anymore, or older titles may be removed."
5,THe BEST SHOOTER IN YEARS,THIs game is the bomb. one problem is that it gets too hard when you are in one player. the coroprate playing is so much better. also the wepons are very useful like the pistol or shotgun. if you like shooters you will like Halo
5,HALO CHEAT,"Hey guys i have a cheat in the first level ""Pillar Of Autumn find Captain Keyes. Afterwards got to where you get your first ammunition. Kill the grunts afterwards go back to Captain Keyes KILL HIM THE MARINES WILL BE INVINCIBLE AND WILL TRY TO KILL YOUGO TO BEHIND CAPTAIN KEYES AND YOU WILL SEE TWO GUYS JUKMP UNDER THEM YOU CAN HIDE THERE AND THE MARINES WON'T FIND YOU BUT MAY SEE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!! WATCH OUT BECAUSE ONE SHOT SETS THIS OFF!!!!!!!!!!!! YOU CAN'T ""Revert to saved"" BECAUSE ONCE YOU KILL HIM IT CHECKPOINTS YOU HAVE TO START THE CHAPTER OVER!!!!!! AND WHERE YOU KILLED THE GRUNTS THERE WILL BE A LOCKED DOOR!!"
5,Best XBox Game so far,"The family has 7 XBox games and Halo has been the one receiving almost all of the playing time. The ""co-op"" mode is great as it lets two players go through the game together. (You can't play the normal game with more than two players, but there are several variations where 2-4 players can play against each other. We haven't tried those yet.) All in all - a very cool game."
5,"Probably the best game available on any system ""HALO""","When I first got my x-box I didn't know what to think I had such high expectations that hardly anything could fill them. Well this game did it. It is amazing!!!It sports virtualy real time game play, with all of the features that make an amazing game. Ranging from it's wide aray of alien and human weapons and vehicles to its amazing plot twists and turns that can only result in your addiction to this game.I can't believe i'm actualy saying this but I lost sleep over thinking about this game after my first day of playing it. It is absolutaly amazing, anyone who enjoyed golden eye for 64 or any other game with a little bit of violence then you will be absolutaly amazed with Halo."
5,Halo Review,"Graphics: 5/5*Comment: It seems Halo only suffers from an unnoticable 30 frames per second loss. Otherwise it's nearly flawless.Sound: 5/5*Comment: Nearly every sound has never been heard before, is created or cast excellently (especially alien voices), and the voice acting is top-notch.Gameplay: 4.5/5/-.5: Repetitive levels in the later half of the game, and too obvious. Bungie could have at least altered them slightly to make them a new experience.*Comment: The repetition really doesn't get in the way of the story, in fact, accordingly with the story, it makes sense.Overall Presentation: 5/5Comment: Overall, the game's presentation is excellent, without any doubt. Every aspect of the game is excellent. Physics, graphics, gameplay: everything.Reviewer's Score: 5/5Total Score: 4.9/5Percent: 98% A+BOTTOM LINE: Halo is quite possibly the best and most important game ever made for any platform."
5,A Great Game,"I just finished this one, and it was awesome. The vehicles are fun, and very well done, especially the 4X4. The ending mission was a touch on the gratuitous side, but man, what a ride! The story is very good, and video cut scenes are great, and the game play is intense! This is the best game I've got for the xbox."
4,Sci-Fi Greatness,"Halo, for the records is a GOOD first-person shooter, but not a greatly exceeding one. Halo uses fine sound, incredible graphics and extraordinary game play that leaves you breathless in your first five minutes of action. The hype did live up and Halo is fun...but there is the con to it. There are only four kinds of alien enemies and they are more cute and dangerous. The weapons are very well created, but there isn't a variety of them, only a pistol, shotgun, rocketlauncher, and rifle. You can use your enemy's weapon and find out they are much better. The use of vehicles in the game add a little more and makes the game good. It's fun and will delight the child in all of us, but there's just not as much to choose from, what you start with in the level, you'll end with, making the overall experience bland."
5,Halo,"This game should easily deserve 5 stars. It has an awesome single player and a lot of multiplayer stuff. This includes a System Link function for up to 16 player games, a co-op mode for two players to play in the single player campaign, and a split screen mode for up to four players. There are A LOT of ways you can twist and edit multiplayer games to make them harder or just plain funnier. And with 4 or 5 levels of difficulty in single player and more than 7 stages in multiplayer (with very many tweaks) this game doesn't get old.I did find problems with the 'Game of the Year Edition' of this game after playing the original version on my Xbox. It kept giving me 'Dirty Disc' and 'Networks Errors' before a multiplayer game, even though the disc was fine. But you shouldn't have this problem as long as you don't keep any of your old user profiles from the original. If this is the first time this game is running on your Xbox then you shouldn't have any problems."
4,Halo Rules!!!,"Halo is the best game ever created. ... You get used to the controllers.It's an awsome game and if you haven't played it you should. ...Halo definitely gets five stars. You have arsenal of really cool weapons vehicles. You even have an intelligent team that actually does something. Multiplayer is awsome with many cool levels, and the cooperative mode is awsome. Single player mode can be decently or VERY, VERY, HARD. It is still very fun ethier way though. It would be worth buying an Xbox if even to just have this great game. To sum it all up: Halo is a MUST HAVE."
4,very close to perfect!,"Hello. I would like to say that Halo is one of the best games I have ever played. The gameplay is amazing, the graphics are great, and the story is well-planned. There are few things about this game that I dislike. They tend to use the same map multiple times, so getting through a level may be very confusing, but it's doable. Also, I wish the game was longer. If you dedicated yourself to it and played it all day for awhile, you can beat it in about a week. It has an amazing multiplayer mode, for up to 4 players, and a multiplayer campaign mode, which I always like. I would most definitely recommend this game for those people who are looking for awesome single-player games as well as a good party game. There is a variety of multiplayer games that you can play, such as capture the flag, invade the base, free-for-all melee, and team battle, as well as others. I hope you found this review helpful."
1,halo is an awsome 1st person shooter,"THis is one of the best first person shooter games i have ever played, and i have played a lot of them buy this game if you love first person shooter games."
1,Oh Please,When i played this with my cousin it was so annoying. I know thats a lousy explination but it was annoying. When XBOX's president compared HALO to Metroid Prime for gamecube that was an insult. Metroid Prime is sooooooooo much better and has been in history longer than HALO. I doubt HALO can make a return like Metroid has. Alls i have to say is dont get this. If you do like it than Metroid prime will blow you away!
1,Halo a expensive piece a garbage,"Well, actually [$$$] piece of garbage because you had to buy the Xbox. Before I begin, I'll list the good aspects of the game:The graphics are goodThere I've listed all the good qualities of the game. now for the bad:*The enemies are kind of difficult to shoot*The weapons are stupid*The controls are difficult to use*You had to buy the Xbox (another piece of [garbage]) to buy this piece of [garbage]*The story is stupid, (you are on the last ship of the aliens that tried to destroy the planet), why couldn't they destroy the last one?*The multiplayer levels are stupidand the last, and biggest*It was published by MicrosoftAAAHHH!!!Save some money, if you want a better game with multiplayer and you want to fight something non-human,get an N64 and Turok 2.PS. If you want a good...First Person Shooter get a PS2, Red Faction, Half Life and XIII."
1,Akc! cHocking!!,"bUrn and die, M1cro5oft!!!!11! Haloo was orginly to be made for THE MAC!! Windos SUXORS, biznatches! B1ll Gat3s is TEH DEVIL!!1!!"
1,Don't buy HALO!,"Everyone,HALO is very violent. If you are parents do not buy this game for your kids. Everyone except my best friend, another boy or two, and the girls like HALO. I mean, it might be fun when you play it, but what if that happened to you? The younger the kid is, the more they'll get corrupted. They'll join the army and blow themselves up. Don't buy this game or and X-BOX. Thonly good games are Oddworld and Fuzion Frenzy. Get a Gamecube instead. It has better games like Luigi's Mansion and Pikmin for kids and Star Wars and SUper Smash Bros. Melee for older kids. So don't buy HALO or an X-BOX."
1,"Imagine Grand Theft Auto, except not fun","Everyone told me about this game before I got an X-box, they were foaming at the it trying to tell me that this was the best game I'd ever play in my entire lifetime, so naturally I was excited when a friend let me borrow his copy. I played through it and I have to ask you guys, is Microsoft paying you to say this crap is playable, or even entertaining? This game is so insanely bad I had to perform cleansing rituals over my x-box."
1,for shame,"listen i was merciful to ninja gaiden but halo is just plain bad. you have this A.I. who practically whispers anything that is half important so the whole game is mainly just kill this thing go here, pretend to sneak in but once you ""Stealth kill"" a guy they all wake up and try to kill you but fail. the weapons all stink too, alien weapons are weak so it takes like a whole clip to kill a guy and human weapons are too few (Assault, Pistol, and Sniper since rockets and shot gun are only at the end of the game!) multi-player is really boring since there aren't alot of options and no bots, not even a little music! the A.I. in your allies and baddies aren't even as smart as they say. if you want a FPS with smart A.I. get Medal of Honour, if you want good muti player FPS get Timesplitters 2, don't buy this abomination."
1,NOT WHAT YOU THINK!!!!,"I dont think antone knows what the hell they're talking about. Halo is by far NOT the best shooter ever. It can be just as easily matched with Duke Nukem 64 for N64. Look, i have a gamecube, and if you want a real shooter, send your piece of crap X-BOX to hell and get a gamecube. X BOX sux X COX!!!! The only reason it even gets a 1 outa 5 is because it's a game!"
1,Good Grief,"This game is way over-hyped. The graphics are good but not revolutionary, and it's basically just another kill-fest. Sure people say it has a ton of incredible parts to them, but I haven't seen any of them yet. And besides that, the controls suck, even with the new ""controller 'S'""."
4,"Wow, what a game.","This game takes me back to the days of old where games weren't too hard and weren't too easy, you know, the days where you really couldn't make a mistake - except miss a target with your gun. I mean, this game is ALMOST a macho man's RPG! This game has the kind of story that says, ""Get ready to take a ride"", and it's hard to turn it down! This game is actually FUN, so any setbacks you have while playing it you'll gladly continue on and try again because they actually made the game FUN. What a concept! Buy it, rent it, just get your hands on it. Definitely the game of the year."
5,The Best Game For Any System... Ever,"This is the best game ever, for any system ever made including the PC.... Heres why I liked:Gameplay: 10Graphics: 9 (the only reason it's not a 10 is that its 30 frames per second, the XBOX norm is 60 fps.)Sound: 10Replay Value:8Value:9Learning Curve:30 minutes to an hourOverall:9.5Oh, and for all of you parents concerned with the M rating that is wrong. There is absolutey no Sexual Content and the marines cursing is almost always drowned out by the gunfire, but when you do here a word it is [mild]. If you are concerned with the goe, there is none, you can turn the blood off and the aliens blood is green so its not that bad. So this game should be a T for mild violence and mild language.... Alright, my review summed up into 3 words,BUY THIS GAME,It should be rated T"
4,Great Headliner for intro to Xbox,"I wouldn't consider this game for any kids under 13, but it is definitely a great opener to Xbox. Much like a Turok of Nintendo 64, it has some great strategy and hidden arenas with extra firepower. At times the cut sequences are too much but overall, I think the game is a great intro for things to come."
5,Can XBOX have a game this good???,"I don't think that XBOX is a good system. But Halo, is the best first person shooter ever made for any system. The story mode is excellent. In addition to the cool story mode, you can also play story mode with a second player to help you. This games multiplayer mode will keep you going for hours. With massive levels, you should have fun for a really long time. Is it worth it getting an XBOX for this one great game???"
2,Strangely overrated,"I have played this game for a few days, and I had a hard time to see what the fuss was all about. I was very surprised to find that Halo was such a mediocre and pre-scripted game - I normally really enjoy shooters like this, but I had a hard time appreciating this one - the graphics weren't all that - the game play the usual boring storyline. The action was fluid, that's about as possitive as I can get."
4,Awsome!,The best scifi 1st person shooter out there.the vehicles are great and so are the weapons.The graphics are great too and its very challenging. the multiplayer is extrodinary as well.I cant wait for the sequal
4,AWESOME`,halo is by far the best first person shooter ive played in my life. The Graphics are amazing and really fun. ITS THE BEST GAME EVER
5,my review,i think this game the best game out for the xbox because the graphics and the gameplay are very good. i also think the missions are very good aswell
4,Cool but Tough!!,"I'm not the best gamer, so I find this game a little difficult and a little frustrating. However, at the store, the people playing the game are having a great time and are way ahead of me. I'm very uncoordinated with the vehicle, but the graphics are awesome and I can't wait to get better at playing it. Buy this game and enjoy."
2,"Good Single Player, Horrible Multiplayer","I was so stoked when I was about to play Halo multiplayer for the first time. I thought it would be great, but I was terribly mistaken. I played for five minutes and hated it. It was horrible. The single player was just like any other game. If you want a good multiplayer game buy Jedi Knight: Dark Forces 2 for PC. If you're gonna get this game, avoid the multiplayer."
2,Realy dserves the M rating,I have only done multiplayer at my friends house... and thats violent enough for me. I think this game is not for those with weak stomachs. I personaly do not recommend this game to people who dont like blood or graphic violece.If you like good graphics and lots of blood (like some people I know) it is a must have. I think it deserves somthing for its graphics.
5,Greatest XBOX game ever!!,"When I first got HALO it was pretty easy because my brother and I were playing co-op, which I personally think is a major plus. After about 2 days or so, it got boring. But, if you have a broadband connection (cable, dsl) you can download a program, for free, ... called the XBOX tunnel. This lets you play online with tons of people!"
5,Half-Life-well HALO is 10 times better!,"Halo for the xbox is one of the most hyper-seamless,realisticfun xbox game there is, and I'm proud to say it's only onthe most advanced gaming platform there is, for now! Cooperativemode takes you slit screen with a friend, beating single playercampaigns, and aiding each other when you need it, and ofcourse the one and only fighting against each other! Halotakes place in the year 2552, when faster than light in spaceis now reality!The covenant, are the first and dumb/funny(I think)aliens the ""SPARTAN 2 military forces from earth"" that theycame in contact with, you are almost invinvicible, considereringyour suit!Besides the point, the ultra realistic graphics in thegame, plays a important part along with the cool sounds of thegame, along with riding alien and human vehicles. Besides thepoint....... this is one of the best sci-fi video game out there!so be warned half-life, unreal, and the rest of you, HALO is putting the pressure on!ps..."
5,Greatest Game,"I heard so much about Halo, and i finally got it polus xbox. Halo is probably the number one best first person shooter games. Although it only moves at 30 frames per second, it still has great graphics. I have played and beaten Halo over 10 times and i still love it. Halo is not only the best first person shooter game, it is the best game i have ever played. If you like games like Goldeneye or Half-Life, this is a game for you."
5,halo is so totally sweet,"im gonna keep this sweetnsimple. halo is cool. the ONLY game that rivals it is diablo 2.mutli player gets kinda boring after playing it about 10 days straightbut single player is hard,wellworth the money.my only complaints are that im on 343 guilty sparkand it says i havent finished assualt on the control room and you cant fly the howler things on multi player.levels could be a tiny bit longer."
5,An awesome game,"This game totally blew me away, from the opening story to the heat of combat. The graphics are intense and seem very real, especially on a large tv. The evolution of the story line combines believability with reality beautifully. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed Goldeneye. Any owner of an X-Box should have HALO and Project Gotham."
5,"Halo, Best Game yet. Bar None.","This game is so awesome, I just bought it two days ago and am having the most fun I have ever had with a video game. I dont even like first-person shooter games, but this one blew me away. Buy it, its worth every penny, you wont be dissapointed."
3,"Great graphics, good game... until it's over.","This game does have great graphics, but certain parts of the game are boring and repetative. I finished the game in normal mode in 3 days. There's nothing special about my game playing ability, except that I can get away with not sleeping. I felt the game was too short, and I had no motivation to try the whole game over in a more advanced mode, because of the boring and repetative nature of MOST of the game. Level after level after level after level, yet all these levels are the same.Tha multiplayer modes are great, and never ending, as you can play over and over again, always with a unique game. If you know ""Perfect Dark"", you know that it's solo missions are OK, but the multiplayer combat simulator rules. Similar story here.HALO is NOT a waste of money, however, don't play it too much or you'll have finished it when you think you're just getting started.Bonus review: DO NOT BUY AIRFORCE DELTA STORM! Waste of money."
5,the best game since goldeneye!!!!!,this game is by far better then goldeneye i own both and goldeneye was great for it`s time but this is the 21st century here! you can drive a tank or a armored vehicle that has a gun and if you have two controllers one person can drive and the other can man the gun or if you don`t do two player then an AI bot will man the gun for you. I havent driven the tank yet but i am sure it is great! you can only carry two wepons at once because microsoft wanted to make it realy realistic but that is plenty of guns. I got this as my first xbox game and i love it! i would recoment this to anyone if they were of age (the esrb rating).
5,What an amazing game,I thought this game would be an excellent game before i even played it. Boy was i right. i have actually played this game at babbages (Game Store) and i was totally astounded. the controls are kind of awkward at first but eventually everyone gets used to any game controls. I dont know what that one person was smokin when he gave it one star but he is totally wrong. i recommend this game to everyone.
4,Halo rules,This was one of the best games ive ever played and ive played alot of games i have all three systems and everything down side is that theres no live but its still an awsome game.Another downside is the lack of really awsome bosses that you start cursing out after the 60th time you fight him also theres a bunch of easter eggs. Heres a challenge after you beat the game look for captain keyes smoking pipe clue:Captain keyes The blob.if yove already played you should get it but if you dont then serch every square block for it.
5,!!!!!!!!!!!!!!$BUY$!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"If you are good with video games, buy this. NOW. The control is very advanced, but if you can do it it its sooooooooooo much fun! Every mode is awesome!"
4,XBOX Evolved!,"This game is the reason why so many of own an XBOX. Every person I know that has XBOX at least has this game. I've played this game for hours and hours and I still never get bored of it! It's that FUN! The graphics are great, all though they could have better vehicals and weapons, but thats what Halo 2 is for. This game doesn't even come close to Timesplitters 2 but don't get me wrong that game is fun as well. The controls are also easy to get use to! If you don't have this game for XBOX you shouldn't own one, for shame. And another thing, for some reason Halo is never there at Blockbuster...coinsedince? I THINK NOT!"
4,The Best,This game was unbliveable at first it seemed stupid when i got it last year but once my bestfreind came over and we playedco-op it was outstanding i recomend this game 100% and i also hope whoever buys this game has a freind to play co-op with bacause that doubles the fun.
4,Stop,"I'm sick of people who write review for this game and bashed it without any backup facts. I suggest you play the game first, then write down what you think. Please don't hate this game just because it's for the XboX and you're against it.Also please don't try to advertise for your choice of console and say things like: Don't get this game, buy a PS2 instead, or buy a GC instead.This is not a battle ground for the console war. So stop writing hateful reviews."
3,Not a HALO review,"This isn't a review of HALO, but a request that others stop submitting ""reviews"" of HALO if they do not own the game or have never played it. There are least 5 reviews here that I have read to the effect of ""this game looks great"" or ""this game doesn't look that good"" by people who have never even played the game. Additionally, people who have only played the game at trade shows such as E3 really aren't that qualified to write a review either. Playing a game like this for an hour is not enough time to give you the plot. While people's opinions on the graphical and texture detail may be valid from only an hour of play time, I found that many of these reviews were misleading and ask that people who don't personally own the game stop reviewing it, as it makes it harder for people like me, who are trying to decide whether or not to buy an Xbox, to judge how good the game actually is."
4,overall good game,I really liked this game. the only downside about this game was the fact that it didnt come with the original case. but overall fun game for hardcore gamers.
5,Halo: The Greatest Game EVER?,"Every once in a while a game comes along that everyone who buys it enjoys, Halo is definetely one of those games. It combines excellent graphics, marvelous gameplay, and great levels. In my opinion, the greatest game in HISTORY, EVER. No game can come close to the power of Halo. So, if you get an Xbox, Halo is a must."
5,"If someone rates this low, they are employed by Sony","Because this is THE system seller for Xbox. It is THE game of all games. That is, until Halo 2 comes out, then it moves to second. Seriously folks, believe the hype this is THE game."
4,the best!!!!!!!,"there's no better shooter out there that even compares to this game. all the elements, music, game play, graphics come together in this game like no other. this game is the main reason to have an xbox. to make things better. as of APRIL 1st 2004, the price of xbox will be dropped to $149!! plus, HALO 2 will be coming out this year & it's live!!! 95% of people have broadband. for $50 (for the live kit. includes headset & 1 year of live) gaming experience takes on a whole new level. try it. you won't regret it."
3,Great first person shooter.,"This game is one of Xbox's best. The graphics are great and so is the sound. Now, on the other hand, the controls are something to get used to. I found them to be really frustrating at times. But, as with everything else, you get better with practice. If you like first person shooter, then this game is for you."
5,The best game ever to come along,"This is the best game so far with it's graphics being the best it has a 1 player mode pluse tou can go through the levels in couoperative play. You can get in 4 differant vehickles the squrpian tank, the warthog, the gohst, and my personal favoret the banchie. There are 8 diferant guns and two types of gernades. This game has manny levels that are very long and very chalenging. All in all this in my opinyion (and what should be every one elses) is the best game ever."
5,Unbeliveable.,This game is a must own. The dialogue is a little corny at times and the plot a little shakey. But the graphics are amazing there are more weapons than there are in Charalton Heston's personal collection. More vehicles then there are in Puff Dady's garage. You will love this game.
5,Innovative and Amazing but Mediocre Amusement,"This game is a masterpiece FOR THE FIRST 6 LEVELS. After that it's annoying and bland until it ends. The 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 5th levels are by far the most fun. The flood is scary at first but eventually gets annoying and repetitive. The game itself was a masterpiece for it's time. I would definitely recommend it to anyone. DO NOT PAY MORE THAN 10 DOLLARS FOR IT THOUGH IN 2013 OTHERWISE YOU ARE BEING RIPPED OFF"
5,Simply a great game,"multiplayer split screen and more. Awesome detail. Simply one of the best games ever, a must buy. Drive in tanks and other vehicles as you fight enemy aliens with an arsenal of weaponry. Great detail and scenery from beginning to end."
5,NICE GAME GREAT STORY,WELL AS FOR MYSELF I HAVE OWNED THIS GAME SINCE IT CAME OUT AND I DOUBTS ABOUT THE XBOX BEING A SUCESSFUL CONSOLE BUT I MANAGED TO GET THIS GAME AND IT TURNED OUT GREAT THIS GAME HAS A GREAT STORY LINE AND ALL OF THE OTHER STUFF THAT THE OTHER REVIEWS TOLD YOU. SO IF U WANT TO GET THE XBOX THE IS A GREAT REASON TO GET IT SO THATS ABOUT IT
5,First nail in (...) coffin,"I have only one word for this game, that word is WOW!!Wrote the above line based on the first day or two of game play. Since then, the game has gotten better and better. Between the shot guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, and even a tank that will make the ""Warthog"" look small and puny by comparison, the game just keeps toping itself."
4,Its a great game but...,"I rushed out to the store and spent $30 on the game that EVERYONE was claiming to be the best game for x-box! And while it is a great game, and alot of fun, it tends to get extreamly repetitious. All you do is wander around and shoot aliens. I loved driving the little land rover... right off cliffs.. haha. I dont believe it is the best thing to ever come out for a gaming system. I do think its a fun game, but not worth $30 bucks. It is defiently a game to own, but would be more worth the money if picked up used, or wait untill it drops to around $20 bucks."
5,One of the best first shooter games ever,"This game is awesome. I have a lot of fun playing it. You get to use a lot of cool weapons. My favorite weapons in this game are the assault rifle, sniper rifle (the sniper is really good against the elites because it kills them with one hit) plasma rifle and the rocket launcher. Another fun thing to do in this game is the melee attacks. Those grunts are so funny when you smack 'em with your gun. I like sneaking up behind the grunts and elites and smacking 'em, it kills them instantly. Unfortunatly this is hard to do to the jackels because they're more self aware and it especailly won't work on the hunters. The best way to kill the hunters is with a rocket launcher which is not always available to you so I'd say use a vehicle or shoot the crap out of 'em with a plasma, assault or sniper rifle or use a turrent gun. My favorite vehicles are the ghost, the banshee and my top favorite is the tank. This game is a every fun shooter game."
5,This game rules,"This is the best game ever. Do not be denide by the 1,2,3,and 4 star reviews. If you have read any of the reviws where they say that the controls are bad...DONT BELIVE CRAP FROM THEM.The controls are fine. Those who love killing their own temates this game is full of it.That is in fact my favorite part of the game. And the multyplar is very good. You can set it to what weapons that you want in the battle, and you can set it to infinit gernades. And thus my review is done. O and 1 more thing the 1 who called everyone who likes this game a moron go tri to dis a 3 year old. It is not our falt that we like the game. And you think it's bad. YEAH THAT IS WHY THERE ARE LIKE 2 1 STAR REVIEWS AND LIKE 4 AND 5 STAR REVIEWS. And if you still think we are morons you rup yourself in the dirt an tri to create a better game."
5,Awesome Game,"The guys at Bungie are awsome. Reason, Halo has to be one of the best games I've ever played. I finished it yesterday and let me tell you I was not disappointed by the ending. It had you wanting to go on forever. Keeping it short and sweet, awesome game. You can't go wrong."
4,Great first Xbox game,"Knowing how fast they had to produce this for the xbox, it is phenominal quality. This game made the xbox what it is. You have got to give it credit for that.I just purchased my first xbox 5 days ago and am still playing Halo (the only game I own) everyday.Halo 2 looks even better and they got my 50 bucks in November when John Kerry is President-elect."
3,"Good first person shooter, but not the best.","[...]BR>This is definetly not the best FPS out there. But it is still a really good game. The action is really heart pumping. THe guns are really cool. Vehicles rock and kick [...] But sometimes the framerate is really slow. Graphics are excellent.This game is just abit boring. 30 minutes of playing is about it. It gets so boring. There is not much . After all, believe it or not, Gamecube is the world wide best seller gaming console.If u have a gamecube, buy Metroid Prime."
5,be a marine,"I hated shooters since long as i can remember and i have played them all from Doom, Heretic, Quake 2, Half-Life, Goldeneye etc. After playing Halo, i am a convert. This was an experience to say the least. The AI, the settings and story itself, are fantastic. Halo engages the intellect to solve every situation and that includes brute force from time to time. This game is a must own for any one over 17. The experiences in this game are memorable."
5,HALO,"This game by far is the best multi game in the market. Me and my five year old son, Nate have beaten HALO several times and we just keep playing it over and over again. HALO reminds me personaly of N64's 007 GOLDENEYE game. Certain games have been created that are just plain fun and HALO meets those requirements. I can't wait until HALO 2. HALO just beats anything Nintendo or Sony has created thus far."
5,In a nutshell -- it rocks!,"Alrighty -- You've read plenty of reviews and whatever. Here's the poop. This game is incredibly fun to play. Somewhere between the stereo sound that told me to shoot left and the fun of chucking a grenade to launch your enemy over a cliff, I found myself quietly going through some hallway, only to get the (...) scared out of me when some alien popped out of nowhere.Incredible.Lucky for me my instinct was to pull the trigger....Seriously, I'm familiar with the gaming world and all the types, although I place having a life above that. In a world competition, I'd lose. I thouroughly enjoy this game, and crank up the sound (much to the dismay of my wife). If and when you do play it, make sure external light is at a minimum. The controller takes exactly 5 minutes to get used to, so you don't have to look at it. Ignore your mother's warnings and play this in total darkness. You'll be impressed."
5,It's Halo,"Need I say more? This game started it all! the storyline is great and the game play is awesome. I bought this game when it first came out and still play it to this day.I do recommend to play with a friend, it adds to the experience."
5,"awsome game, the covenet attack!",This may be my favorite video game for XBOX!! I hope Master Chief can destroy the Covenet and the flood!!!
5,Best Console Game of the Year,"This game raises the bar for console gaming for any genre. I've played many of the top console games (GTA3, GT3, Devil May Cry, MSG2, Twisted Metal Black, DOA3, etc.) this year as I own both XBOX and PS2, but this is the most enjoyable by far. To be sure, this game has some major flaws such as limited weapons and enemies, major frame rate drops during intense battles sequences, and repetitive gameplay. But only a game as great as Halo could distract the gamer away from these fatal issues to reach video game bliss.The split-screen cooperative mode is amazing and the most fun I've ever had playing a video game. The intensity level of some of these battles played out with your marines against the aliens are straight out of Star Wars.One note to PC FPS veterans- as you might expect this is not your average PC FPS which requires lightning quick reflexes."
5,wow great game,Great story and awesome effects but the game could have been longer I also loved that you could play two player missions it made it really cool
5,This game is kickass!!,"This game is really freaking fun. Most of the other reviewers have said what I want to say, but I wanted to add that this is a funny game too. The comments have me in stitches sometimes. The soldiers are known to say things like ""get up so I can kill you again,"".Great game, probably my favorite combat game out there."
3,HALO,HALO IS THE BEST GAME EVER MADE. THIS IS THE BEST GAME FOR XBOX THE GAMPLY IS COOL THE CONTROLS ARE VERY GOD BUT THE DRIVING IS A LITLE HARD BUT YOU GET USE TO.
5,HALO,HALO is one of the best games on the XBox. If you have an XBOX than you should have HALO. HALO provides with the best single player firefights and the best Co-Op mode I have ever seen. Bring some friends over and play the deathmatch mode(turn the vehicles on for the most fun)and play the craziest deathmatch you have ever seen. GET HALO. It's the game for XBOX.
1,Halo 1 & 2 is the worst games ever,I don't understand why people like these games so much. I hate them and here's why....1 Graphics are horrible and looks like a SNES2 Enemies are dumb and you can just shoot like that EASY3 it's a dumb and easy easy game and you should not buy it
1,HALO IS ALL HYPE!,"... The game itself, while somewhat neat looking, was ridiculous. I felt like I was being attacked by hordes of MUPPETS, as that's what the enemies looked like. The weapons were all stupid and unrealistic..."
1,VERY BORING!!!!,I decided to rent this game because nobody at school would shut up about it. It was as boring as hell!!! The graphics are not good and the combat is terrible. They will REALLY need to improve on the sequel for this one!
1,Where is The Halo?,"I woke up this morning, and I ate atleast 3 pancakes, and then I bought a new scrren door.I went to the park at about 3 o clock, and then I ate a tomtato.And the the question occured to me, where is the Halo?let me examine my facts...The crayon was green...no wait... yellow...I ate a tomtato today.And there is this bird talking to me....So where is the Halo? I just don;t understand.maybe someday a Panda will take me to Canada on a Narwhal...I wish I understood why there was Fire Comming Out of That one Monkey's head....Where am I?"
1,"The""craze""","I keep hearing about this game.I own a ps2 and a gamecube.I always ask""whats so special about xbox?"".People always reply with the name""halo"".then I ask""whats so special about halo?"".then they reply""it is the best game ever"".then I think""if people are buying xboxs just for halo,its got to be the best god**** game ever"". To this day I still ponder what the big deal is.its just one game,how good can it be..."
1,halo combat reduced,halo is completely overated. im 17 and i gotta tell you metroid prime is way better. halo has horrible controls horrible camera angles repetitive gameplay zero innivation and most of the game was pretty EASY. theres only a few weapons and they look like sh-==. the graphics are only mediocre and the gameplay is the same crap over and over again. even rachet and clank going commando for the ps2 was a better shooter than this garbage. if you really want the best shooter dump your xbox get a gamecube and get metroid prime. a game that should have got as much credit as this overated trash. dont get the game. because this awful game is a poor sad and pathetic excuse for a shooter game. most of the time you are running around in circles anyway.
2,It's not that good,"This game plays alot like Turok for N64, it's not as revolutionly as people have said this game was. Buyer's beware. This is an average shooter with great graphics."
1,What the hell,"What the hell you can't even be wonder woman what kind of super friends game is this?And, the game relies too much on multi-player games. I don't have any friends to play with!!"
1,Halo is the best first person shooter ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have played many first person shooters in my life. Halo is 1000 times better than Max Payne and all of those games. The graphics are awesome, the gameplay rules, and the whole plot of the game makes me want to keep playing it for hours at a time. Sometimes, i go over to my uncles house and play multiplayer with all of his friends, and i get there at about 7:00, and we dont stop playing until about 4:00 in the morning. If you like action/shooting games, Halo is the game for you!"
1,Very poor graphics,"I just bought an x-box about 2 hours ago and it came with halo, I've read all the online reviews and user reviews which said how great the graphics were, how amazing they were in fact. So I go home with a big smile on my face and fire up the x-box expecting great things, thats not what I got, the graphics in this game are BAD !!!, really really really Bad, just turn the game on and slowly look around in the first screen of the game, the laddering was so bad on every straight line that the screen was swimming.Perhaps in comparison to PS1 or PS2 games the graphics are good but if you are a PC gamer with even a geforce2 card you will be seing much much better graphics on your PC.To sum it up, if you own a PC, especially a good one with a recent graphics card and are thinking about buying an x-box because of all the hype about games like halo then you will be disappointed, it's a long way off a good PC.Disappointed x-box owner :("
1,The Usual,"Well, I rented this game to see if I'd like it before I bought it. I'm glad I didn't buy it. If I wanted a game where I go and shoot things I'd just pull out Metal Gear Solid. It was ""interesting"" to put it nicely. Controlling the vehicles was difficult. It got boring after a while but if you haven't ever played any other games where you go and shoot you might like it. The game was almost identical to others like it except for the plot, creatures, and guns."
1,What the...,"This isn't a game...it's an evil entity from you-know-where....it's come to take over the human race...and it's succeeding...it almost got me. I rented it, then realized within minutes that I was playing a clump of manure, not a ""superb and divine game experience"". I truly believed that RPGs saved me...if you find your psyche being taken over by this evil, feverish disease known as ""Halo"", quickly play FFVII or Chrono Cross. It's the only cure. And now, the evil entity has devised a way to clone itself. That's right, Halo 2 is upon us, and the foolish public still hasn't wised up. Run while you still can, dear reader. You may think you're too clever to be tricked by evil, but this is such a twisted machination that it even made Game Informer its mindless puppet. If you must have an FPS, buy Metroid Prime...Nintendo is the only savior from the demon-spawn that is Halo."
5,ONE BAD SHUT-YO-MOUTH,Man this game is off the hook. pure action all the way through.Very interesting storyline. MULTI-PLAYER....MONEY IN THE BANK.
5,How is this game not #1,Let me tell you this ive been gaming all my life and halo is the best game since super mario. I love using my xbox live to play against people on the internet. This game is deffinetely a buy not a rent.Though there is only 7 or 8 levals each level takes 1 hour-1 1/2 hour.the multiplayer mode is irresistable. Even the trial is better than 3/4 of all games out there.deff a buy
5,Halo the best game for any console!,"If you own a X-Box HALO is a must have! It is the best game ever, on any system. The graphics are beatiful and the gameplay is quick and smooth. In campaign it has a wonderful co-op feature and in multi-player the maps are brilliant, filled with wonderful places for sniping my favorite. This game is the BEST you must buy it!"
2,Not the best game...,"Yes, I know there's over a thousand reviews to say differently. The game is just...slow...when compared to games like Unreal Tournament. Maybe it's the huge maps that make it seem slow, but it seems more along the line of Nintendo 64's ""Goldeneye"" (which is actually playable with the Turbo cheat) then PC games like Half-life. The lack of online playing really is a handicap--if it was on Xbox live it would have bumped up the rating a bit. If you haven't purchased the game, wait for Halo 2, but in the meantime play Unreal Championship. If you must, rent the game--it can be easily beat over a weekend."
4,BETTER THAN GTA AND ALL BOND GAMES!!!,"Halo is the best game ever. It consists of bond like action fights and some of the best weapons ever. You don't have an Xbox without Halo. And it's not that bad either. What I mean is that the ""M"" was .oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo1mm away from being a ""T"". There's no blood like Bond or GTA, and there is ABSOLUTLY no foul language. Parents, I love this game, and I'm a parent myself, so if you are concerned about whether your son/daughter should play this, you can trust that it's suitable for them.A concerned parent"
5,An amazing game,I bought this game after beating halo 2 and since I never played this game I wanted to give it a try. It is way to much fun to be a video game. The graphics are ok but that is in 2007 6 years ago these graphics were amazing. The game is really good because of the single player. The single player is superb. It is fast paced but on harder difficulties you just can go in rambo or you will die. This game is very good and I still find myself playing this game even with all of the good games out right now.
3,Nuttin' compared to Max Payne,"The graphics in this game are really good and I happen to have beaten this game on legendary, so listen up! I love this game and all but c'mon! In the middle of the game, you fight against undead! Its like while the developers were making the game they happened to hear about a little game called Resident Evil. The enemies in this game are not quite challenging and some can get annoying. The levels also start to get boring as you continue on in the game. Anyone who has beaten Legendary will know what I am talking about. It disappoints me that the game doesn't have much weapons to choose from. Halo is a good game and all..."
2,cheap plastic,"Don't be confused, it's a cheap plastic reproduction and the price reflects that. When it says die-cast, one expects a certain precision and sturdiness. And yes, they tried to duplicate the Valkyrie, but the front fork on mine simply comes off and the remainder seems much to fragile. I'm still looking for a good one."
5,"If you can find this book, READ IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","This is one of the best books I've ever read--and I've read a lot! Seventeen year old Lyn travels back in time to 18th Century Louisburg, and is assumed to be a local girl, Elizabeth. Living Elizabeth's life, she struggles to get along in this time period and also figure out what happened to her. It is a most enjoyable book, and it's a shame that it's out of print. I was fortunate to stumble across it at one of my local libraries. If it's ever reprinted, you can be sure I'll purchase it in a hurry!"
4,Is there a sequel?,"I found this to be a great novel, a little hard to get into, but once I got going found it pretty cool. What annoys me is that this book seems (to me) that there should be a sequel!"
4,Part 3 of a Brillaint Game Series,"While considerably different game play from Oddworld 1 and 2, the third installment is none-the-less enjoyable, if not quite as challenging in the puzzle-solving area. Quirky characters, environment and dialogue is still there, and it is quite a fun game."
2,No Long Lasting Fun,"This is not a must get game for xbox. It's fun in the beginning but after about 2 hours of playing it it get s boring. You just do the same thing through ou the game, save your people . It'll get boring , believe me."
1,"Sounds made the game, without it....","I recently purchased a 360, and had played Oddworld: Abe's Odyssey a while before. I thought this game would be good, especially with the ""Platinum Hits"" plastered on it. The gameplay changed drastically! Maybe because now it's in 3D, it seems less entertaining. And you run around collecting these weird fruits to access portals to free Mudokons. Worst part: SOUND. I don't know if it's because the 360, but when you tell your little friends to follow you, or let one rip, hard, YOU CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING! Even with the music turned down, and turning the volume up, you can barely hear anything.I stopped playing mid-first level."
3,Just as boring as Xbox,I got this game 2 weeks ago and it is the most boring game of the genre I ever played. There is simply not enough action unlike Luigi's Mansion on the Nintendo GameCube. I beat both of these games twice and unlocked everything and Oddworld Munch's Oddysee is no where close as fun as Luigi's Mansion. I think this game has a great amount of brain teasers to do but I still think this game [stinks]... Its up to you if you like this game or not this is just my opinion.
2,Just not fun!,"Graphics: Amazing-looking worlds. Unfortunately, the characters are so ugly that it actually detracts from the fun. And I've got to stare at their backs for the ENTIRE game? Whose idiotic idea was that?Gameplay: Neither Abe nor Munch can defend themselves without hassling others to help them. They can fart and chant to make green fruit grow, that's about all they can do by themselves. Munch waddles and pathetically hops, making him a total loser.The levels are complicated, confusing, slow, convuluted and annoying.Music: Minimalistic, but that's a good thing, considering you'll hear it again and again as you struggle to get out of each level.I can't grasp how, even five years ago, someone could find this fun to any stretch. I got this for 2 bucks, and it's horrible! Thank God I traded it back in at another store for the same $ in store credit.Don't worry, there's still time to return your copy. Play Mario or Sonic instead: they blow this crap out of the water!"
4,Love It!!!!,"Today I finally received my Xbox, and purchased a copy of Oddworld to go along with it. What can I say?? I love this game!! It reminds me of Mario World on the N64, in that you send Abe and Munch all over the place solving puzzles and finishing quests as Mario World 64 had you doing with Mario, except Abe and Munch are much more cool and humorous than Mario EVER WAS!!! It's an absolute delight to play and if you liked Mario World but not the ""kiddie"" mentality of the game, then you will LOVE Oddworld!!"
4,Love This Game,"I'm not really a big fan of playing videogames. Some entertain me more than others. I've always been a fan of oddworld games, and I have almost every single one. If you enjoy weird creatures, and entertaining videogames, I think you'll love this one."
3,This game will NOT work on Xbox 360..,Great game but not compatible for xbox 360. I wish I knew before I purchased it. It's a shame microsoft hasn't made a fix for the old games.
5,fun,"I originally didn't like Abe's Oddessy for Playstation. It grew very boring very fast. That is what I expected from this game (Munch's Odessy)also, but it came in my bundle no choices made by me. So, I gave it a chance. Now I find myself waking up earlier in the mornings before work to play a little. And I have a hard time putting the controller down. My wife likes to just sit and watch the game like it was a movie. The dialogue/game is so funny. It isn't a serious game, but a very fun game for all ages, on an unbelievably awesome system (x-box)."
3,"Great Graphics and good story line, but a little goofy","The first thing you notice about the game is the incredible graphics and world that you are now in. It's truly amazing what they have done. I was not completly impressed with the actual game play, probably because I'm not much for these types of games. All in all it was a fun game to play for a few days, but I wouldn't buy this game.** Shannon **"
2,pretty annoying,"I give this game a little credit on the graphics but other than that it's pretty annoying, from the controls (especially Munch)to the character's voices. This isn't my style of game but I'm sure some will like it."
3,Average,"I was super excited about this game as it has been so hugely hyped and EGM gave it a higher review than Jak and Daxter on PS2. The graphics were good and the theme, like all Oddworld games, was very interesting and high quality. However, the game was frankly boring and slow. The controls were weak and some of the puzzles were a bit difficult. I would have given it a 2 but the creativity was top notch. But hey it always comes down to GAME PLAY for me. Rent but don't buy...."
3,"good game, small flaw","Very good game, totally captiveating when playing, only flaw i have found, No tech support thru oddworlds site either which isn't a good thing. i have saved games, when playing thru and into bonus stages it will freeeze apon trying to enter a section you have a saved game on. ( i have one saved game perfect score i saved in its last stages before the movies in vykker suites at the end, and a saved game with 100% bad quarma beofre bonus sections, i deleted the bad one, but don't want to delete the evry first perfect quarma game i got)outside of that, the abilty to possess your enemys is great, i just love that feature.not many hidden goodies though, woulda been better with a few hidden rooms to find extras or just new places to see. i do recomend the game, just wish it had better support thru the company that made it."
4,Strange Creatures + Puzzles= Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee!,"Oddworld...Oddworld...where to begin? I recently purchased the two prequels (Abe's Exodus and Abe's oddysee) and Munch's Oddysee is much different. Anyway, you find out that Munch, the last Gabbit (fishlike creature) is wanted for the lungs of the Glukkon Queen. He runs into Abe, a Mudokon, and together, they go on the ultimate quest for the last can of Gabbiar (a pun for caviar), Gabbit eggs. The game used to be based on GameSpeak, a function of Abe to talk to his buds and have them do stuff like pull levers and such, but it is more puzzley than before. Abe can jump well over land but cannot swim. Munch is a good swimmer, but cannot talk to Abe's pals. See what I mean about the puzzles? Overall, the Newspaper clippings you get are HILARIOUS so buy this game if you can find a reasonable price and if your not the kind of puzzle-kind of guy, buy Halo."
5,I loved this game,Munche's Odyssey is one of the best games I have ever played. I would advise anyone who likes adventure games to check it out. It didn't last to long because I passed the game in a week and since there is no multi-player I don't play it anymore. The game is very cheep and it's worth it.
5,Easily one of my favorite Xbox Games.......,Halo and Splinter Cell are my favorites ( as of right now )This game will make you think and work hard till the end!A must have for any Xbox owner!Overall: I hope they make a sequel to this game!
4,A Great 3D Platformer,"-Chad Steingraber--Paradigm/Infogrames--Level Designer/Game Designer/3D Artist on The Terminator: Dawn of Fate-The game is odd, but then it is called ""Oddworld"" after all...so don't be shocked when you find yourself saying, ""that's odd"". But, the real question should be, ""Is it fun?"". That completely depends on your perspective...do you like slower paced games where you run around and collect things to solve puzzles? Jumping around to hit the next piece of the ladder? Telling little baby looking things to attack your enemies? Then this is the game for you. I personally enjoyed playing it, but I couldn't play it for a long amounts of time....I'd get a little bored....but that's me.One thing that did bug me was some of the music, after a few hours, I couldn't stand listening to it....I had to turn the volume down just so I could keep playing. Younger kids will love this game, adults might shy away."
4,Cool Game,"This is a great game for X-BOX,it might make people want X-BOX instead of PS2 or Gamecube.I played the first Oddworld for Playstation1,I loved it I think this is a great game but I wish it was coming for PS2,my system....."
1,Like really bad adventure games?,"Want a boring experience with clumsy play control? Then pick this poor excuse for a killer app up. You will appreciate Mario and Sonic more, but that still won't get you your money back."
1,WORST GAME EVER,I HATE THIS GAME!THERE IS NO FINAL LEVEL!I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT SOMEONE WOULD THINK THIS GAME WOULD BE FUN.THE STORYLINE MAKES NO SENSE.BUY SOMETHING ELSE INSTEAD OF THIS PEICE OF S***!!! IF THERE WAS A 1STAR RATE I WOULD'VE CHOSEN THAT ONE. THIS GAME DOESN'T EVEN DESERVE A ONE STAR!
1,If there was a no star option I would choose it!,I hate this game! The stupid thing is so ugly! I would rather throw my pc into a fire than play that again! PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!!!! If you do I will feel very sad for you!
4,Absolutely outstanding!,"This game puts you in the life of 2 likable, funny, and gross characters. Gameplay itself is a 5, but I think the graphics could have been better since it was on the xbox. The levels are fun to think about. This is a great game. At least rent it!"
4,"Wierd, but fun","I liked this game so much!! Not loved, but liked, liked enough to keep on playing it. The guys are such a blast to play, especially Munch. He may not have much going for him, but I love the radar zapper he has. Drink a can of Zapp, and he's leathal! Great fun. And, it improves your communication skills. ""Hey! It's Abe!"""
5,Funny Game - Great Story,"This is one of the first games I got with my Xbox recently. The storyline is funny. It's like a mini-movie and game in one. I suggest players take advantage of the quick save option as they make progress in the game. I suggest at least renting it but I would buy it myself. Also reviewers don't leave a review, specially on new games that are still not released, if you have not played them. I'm tired of seeing reviews for a game the public, as well as the reviewer, have not even played yet. By the way the XBOX ROCKS!"
5,Absolutely fun game,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this fun and engrossing game. The characters are weird and well created ( not ""cute"" like Nintendo) that it makes the storyline compelling. You just want to know how the story goes. The movie sequences are great, graphics are Xbox quality."
4,Quirky.,"With a messed up sense of fun (the central character is a fish confined to a wheelchair - I laugh cruelly!), it looks like this is going to be one of the launch games to watch. If you've played the previous Oddworld games, you'll feel right at home with the truly wacky style and strangely infuriating but addictive puzzle-type gameplay.Note: not really for younger kids unless you want them having nightmares about their mouths being sewn shut and getting attacked by vicious alien monsters. But if you're old enough to appreciate black humor you'll love it."
2,"fast delivery, bad game quality","The entire transaction was quick and simple, the game I ordered came fairly quick. The only problem is when I play the game, there is no vocals, when the character talks is just low mumble and is unrecognizable. So the only thing I hear when I play is low background stage music, which keeps me completely confused in the aspect of the storyline."
4,Love it!!!,"Great game! Loved playing it on Playstation. It broke, replaced with XBOX, so to have the same game again is great! Graphics are great and I'm still learning to navigate, but I'm having a blast!"
4,Fun,This game is fun and i like it... this has nothing to do with reviewing the game but im stuck on the level when abe and much meet again.. i hope someone can answer my question and tell me what i have to do after you get the fuzzles and stuff thanks
3,Nice gaming but repetative,"I agree with the others who point out that Odd World gets boring quickly. I rented this game and, after a few hours of gameplay, I came to realize I've seen it all. The difficulty increases only by increasing the number of 'monsters'. No new tricks. All the solutions are combinations of previous solutions. I returned it early, very glad that I didn't buy it."
4,Odd but fun game,"I received this game for Xmas, I probably wouldn't have bought in on my own. The game is a lot of fun as it is very different from any other game I've played. The graphics are great and the overall gameplay is very good. If you are tired of the sports games and the typical fighting games, try this one out."
4,Another hit from the Hudson Falcons,"This is going to be a short review, but I wanted to recommend this album. Its another strong output from the Hudson Falcons. Not quite as hard of an album as ""For Those Whose Hearts and Souls are True"" but better lyrically.Songs 1 and 8 are the best in my opinion...Buy this album.Scott"
1,This book really sucks,"This is a total waste of money because it's all ritten in cursive. This book is suppoused to be for kids and not all kids can read cursive. Also this book has good artwork but the learning is tearible. I sware that they should have this item discontinued by manufacture, because it really sucks and gives no realation to Wizardolagy, dragonolagy, and egyptionolagy. I hate fairyopolis!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Great first impression gift,"This book is a wonderful gift for a young girl. Their eyes open wide when they open the wrapping paper and see the cover and leaf thru the pages. The problem is what others have said - that the small script print is very hard to read. But, it is still fun to look at. That is why I have bought multiple copies to give as gifts this year."
2,hard to read the story,"font was very smallscript was difficult to read (even with my glasses)... almost impossible for my daughter to readslight damage... used should not have torn pop-up's (this is a pop-up book)story is great and the premise is super... but again, just hard to read. If the publisher made the font a lot larger this would be a home run"
5,For the fairy lovers,"This is a lovely book! Filled with all sorts of fairy information, some of it playfully hidden behind secret flaps, and the whole book is covered in beautiful artwork.....a truly magical escape for anyone young at heart!"
3,Beautiful but disappointing - hard to read font!,"I was very excited to receive this book for my daughter as she and my son both love the ""ology"" books.The illustrations are beautiful - they remind me of vintage cards, and there are a lot of interactive things on each page (just like the ""ology"" books).However, this book is really only good to look at. The writing is in illegible cursive - I really have to work hard to make out the text; there is no way that my daughter will be able to read it herself.No matter how beautiful the pictures are, it's hard to appreciate them if you can't read about them. What a waste!!"
1,pretty but of poor quality,"You can tell a book that's been put together quickly to make a buck. Though intially attractive, this is just such a book. It's obvious that it's publisher wanted to cash in on the Ology books, so they've slapped together this book by using Barker's art, but other people's ideas. It's a cute book, but the folklore is filled with errors, the layout is very hard on the eyes and I just don't feel good about supporting a book that is cashing in on the innovations of others. For more thoughtful ""interactive"" books have a look at Dragonology and Wizardology. For books on faeries, I'd recommend any of Brian Froud's books."
3,pretty is as pretty does,"this book is absolutely beautiful. the artwork is great, the inserts are interesting...the story is really dull. really, really dull. obviously, there was not a great amount of thought given to to the actual story line.in addition, it isn't good for young children. the handwriting can be hard to read for an adult and it is obviously not fit for young children."
2,not what i expected,"i actually returned the book. When I received it both i and my husband looked at it and said the same thing that the script writing throughout the book was hard to read. This was a let down especially after reading wizardology, egyptology and dragonology. I would only recommend it for adults who collect books on fairies."
2,Pretty book,"Not what I expected...definitely not a childs book....they loved the pretty diamond on the cover, but not the inside!"
5,A charming way to spend rainy afternoons,I bought this for my 7 year old daughter and she loves it. She pores over it and loves the extra details tucked in it. The only caution that I would add is that the handwriting is old-fashioned and in cursive and is therefore somewhat difficult for new readers to read but she sure loves trying.
5,More real stories,"I bought this book with the ""If You Could Only See .. A Gnome's Story."" What a great combination, thanks Amazon. Both offer REAL accounts of the fairy realms, and gnomes kingdoms. Just right for the times. Fairyopolis explores a specific encounter in Sussex, and Dr. von Lahr's A Gnome Story is an exploration of fairies and gnomes from many years of direct channeling as a psychic medium. What they both deliver is Real Encounters. Great work Cicely. So many of the nature spirit books are delivered as mythical accounts, but now, we have some first-person descriptions.Sue"
5,Beautiful Book!!!,"I ordered this book for my 7-yr. old granddaughter for Christmas, and was amazed at what an enchanting book it really was. My granddaughter was very excited when she opened the package containing the book and started looking through the book. Loaded with beautiful color illustrations and pop-up features, even the ""big people"" enjoyed looking through the book!"
3,It's ok .....,"Purchased this book for a 9 year-old girl. Think the book is written in too scripty (fancy) style writing for someone who is just learning cursive writing (2nd grader who is 9 yrs. old) it's hard for them to read. It is also set up in a journal, scrap-book kind of layput (guess I missed that in hte review) expected a story about faires. So it was ok. My daughter who is 7 thought it was pretty to look at..."
4,Endearing Treasure Book,This is a wonderful book for children who have an attraction to fairies and the mystical world around them. Each page has some adventure of seek and find with hidden interactive treasure for the child.The only thing I would suggest is that the parent read along with the child as some of the reading is in cursive. The charms and pop outs are attached with ribbon and envelopes so they don't get lost.My daughter has had this book for over a year and takes it out especially when the weather is nice to create her own adventures. This book works especially nice if you have a garden or trees in your area. The imagination seems to go from page to pavement and then some.
5,Beautiful book that transports you to a different world...,"I'm 16 years old, and I love this book. I received it for Christmas a few years back and love to take it off the shelf every once in a while. It's a perfect book to take out on a sunny day and read on a warm afternoon, or to curl up in bed at night with a flashlight.The illustrations by Cicely Mary Barker are SUPERB. This woman had a style of painting that should have become as popular as Beatrix Potter's. This book incorporates her paintings and poems into a story about Cicely Mary Barker and her own encounter with fairies.Whenever someone saw this book on my shelf or something, they immediately gasped and started looking through it. It really is a beautiful work of art.ONLY WARNING I have is that the print that the story is written in is a cursive that may be difficult for some people to decipher. :)Wonderful book!"
5,Wonderful gift -- well received!,"I purchased Fairyopolis: A Flower Fairies Journal for a young-adult artist friend who always has been inspired by fairies. She adored the book and refers to it while coming up with new and innovative designs.This is a beautiful volume, colorful and nicely designed."
5,A delightful book!,"If you are a fan of the Flower Fairy books of Cecily Mary Barker you need to have this book! It will give you a peek into Miss Barker's personal life and how she learned what she knew of the fairies. If you are not familiar with the Flower Fairies, this is a good place to start. Every page has beautiful artwork and another surprise. This is an eight-to-eighty book, not just for children."
1,This is why i love Jerry Bruckheimer and America!!!,"Don't let my blurb scare you off. This isn't the worst movie ever made in any sense. However it is very un-American in its form. It isn't done that well at times and the plot is difficult to follow. Not to mention that Skeet Ulrich pulls off the worst performance I have seen all year. I know he was never great but he was never this bad. I mean his performance here is plain bad. I felt that there were times when I was supposed to know what was going on and I just didn't. I commend them for the style though. The fast music, the fast filming here and there. this film seems like a Dutch mix of THE BOURNE IDENTITY, any Jerry Bruckheimer movie, and RUN LOLA RUN. Worth a watch on a rainy day."
2,THE COLOR BLUE,"SOUL ASSASSIN could have been a fairly entertaining little thriller. It has a complex plot with lots of twists and false leads, and some skillful performances from supporting players Rena Owen and Derek De Lint. However, director Laurence Malkin decided to film 90 percent of it with a blue filter; erratic MTV-style choppy scenes and focused very little on the script or its performers. Hence, all we get is a muddled tale of corporate deception and murder. The use of the blue screen and its chaotic camerawork serves only to make the film more annoying than entertaining. Skeet Ulrich is lost in the miasmic mess and the original Buffy (Kristy Swanson) just floats around with a gun in her hand most of the movie. A potentially good movie murdered by its execution."
5,Fun Ride,"I rented and then bought this DVD. It is different and has an attitude. Off beat locale and happenings...a bicycle chase in Amsterdam, a sniper shootout on the canal and lots of quick cuts and Hi Tech look and feel. The story is interesting as well...betrayal by a ""father figure"".I have read some negative reviews of this movie by uptight ""filmees"". Get a life!! They over analyze all of the things about the movie that are actually fun....the pacing, the styized look, the blue filter....that's what is fun. Get your nose out of obscure and boring films and enjoy life."
2,Horrible film...but it had potential,"This film could have been much better. The Plot actually tried to be intelligent but failed miserably. While the story was unique but it was simply put together so badly half the time you were like what the hell is going on. Even when the film tries to explain it at the end it still does a super poor job.The action was simply laughable since you couldnt see what was going on due to the purposely shaky filming to make the action look like it was in your seat. It was not a good idea because unless you have an exciting plot and well explained action is not needed. But the action was horrible and plot was explained at a D-.Good points: attempt at a good storyBad points: poor coreography, poor production of action sequencesworst points: boring film due to bad action sequences and poor story tellingOverall movie grade D+"
2,This shows why American cinema rocks!!!,"Don't let my blurb scare you off. This isn't the worst movie ever made in any sense. However it is very unamerican in its form. It isn't done that well at times and the plot is difficult to follow. Not to mention that Skeet Ulrich pulls off teh worst performance I have seen all year. I know he was never great but he was never this bad. I mean his performacne here is plain bad. I felt taht there were times when I was suppossed to know what was going on and I just didn't. I commend them for the style though. The fast music, the fast filming here and there. this film seems like a Dutch mix of THE BOURNE IDENTITY, any Jerry Bruckheimer movie, and RUN LOLA RUN. Worth a watch on a rainy day."
4,The Prince,There is a problem with this shipment. I have communicated numerous time but fail to hear back from anyone. Pleas e-mail me asap. Thank you.
2,Take it or Leave it,"I'm not entirely sold on this product. I could take it or leave it. It gets caught it my throat sometimes, I guess because they are round tablets that are fairly large. I'm not entirely sure if it's helping or not as well, and it smells bad when you take it out of the bottle to take. I keep it in the fridge as directed and take it between meals 3 times a day as directed. I really don't like supplements that you have to take so much of and so many times a day because I find my body reacts badly when one pill has to be taken so many times a day. It suggests 6 pills a day and that's on top of several other supplements that I take.I have a low immune system that was why I was taking it, it's hard to tell if it's gotten better."
1,Yuck!!!,"If you are reading this review, you must know about the many nutritional benefits of spirulina. For example, per gram, it has a very high protein content. The problem is, to ingest a meaningful quantity of nutrients, you need to eat a whole lot of this spirulina powder, and this powder is horrible to eat! I cannot imagine that ANYONE would actually choose to eat spirulina if not for its nutritional content. This stuff tastes like smelly, old fish. The powder is green, and turns everything that comes into contact with it turns green. I found it difficult to ""hide"" in any food, the taste is so strong. Water rehydrates the powder and makes it swell, so you can't dissolve it. And though I can't be completely certain, I experienced abdominal pain and nausea after eating just a couple of teaspoons on more than one occasion. I know there are far more pleasant ways to eat healthy. This stuff is simply not worth whatever nutritional benefits it may have!"
1,Very sick from this product,"I was thrilled to start using this product. I green juice every day and have been doing so for quite some time. About 3 months ago I started adding this spirulina to my juice. After about 2 months, I started noticing some nausea after consuming it. This got progressively worse every day until about a week ago when I vomited within 5 minutes of drinking it.Just the thought of it makes me nauseous now.I wrote to the company asking if it's possible that the product could be contaminated.No response from them at all. (they are very vigilant in their webpage about preventing contamination).I'm open to other reasons that I'm so sick from this but as far as I can tell, this brand of Spirulina Pacifica is contaminated."
2,"This item is NOT organic, as they've it advertized!!! :(","Amazon.com has this item advertized as ORGANIC Spirulina, but after about 2 days of taking them, I was reading the label and nowhere on the label it says ORGANIC, neither any of the ingredients are organic.Since I only took them for a couple of days I can't tell if they actually work, but I've heard great stuff about the Chlorella and Spirulina. Check out the Consumer Wellness Research Center website,. They a book w/lots of great info about both supplements, it's free, and YOU CAN read the whole book for FREE."
3,Not too sure on the results so this is my rating.,"I've bought this from reading articles of its healing capabilities. It wont heal your disease or illnesses but from what i read, it must be a superior version of vitamins and dietary supplements that are out today in your local stores. I actually gave it a three star because I haven't really used it in the long run. I will come back to review this comment as soon as I see the results."
3,6 a day!,"6 a day seems like a lot! I don't know if I took this long enough to see results, but when I did take it, I didn't notice any."
4,delicious and nutritious,"I first heard about Spirulina from an infommercial late at night. I bought this a few months ago and just used it today.The smell of the powder was that of algae from the ocean. I was a bit put off by it at first.Wasnt sure how much liquid to mix it with so i added about 1.5 cups of orange juice.It was a decent taste and easy to swallow although the OJ didnt completely mask the flavor of the algae but it was easy enough to drink without gagging.Within a few minutes i felt it work into my system. I had just woken up and was still tired. After drinking this, i was beginning to feel energized and.... Had to go to the restroom. Lol.I dont know if thats a recurring reaction but i will definitely continue to use this product! I love all the nutrition it provides and it seems to be better than taking a multivitamin!"
4,1000 mgs not for me,"I bought the 1000mg tablets because I figured I would rather take 3 big tablets vs a bunch of the small ones. Could be psychological, but I just don't feel these horse tabs are as effective as the small ones were. I will probably be going back to the 500 mg size after this bottle is done."
1,Secret ingredient,"I came to this product searching for an addition to my supplement combo that would't empty my wallet. After buying two of Nutrex Spirulina bottles, i realized they contain the allergic, not-well-tested substance Vegetable Magnesium Stearate. If you are looking for a quality Sprirulina supplement, look somewhere else. :("
1,Terrible Reaction,"I've been a vegan for over a year and when I read about this product, I was so excited! I took it last week. At first, I felt energized. Then a few hours later I began to vomit. I did this 10 times. I was very sick. Freezing and fever. It took 5 hours from the time I began to throw up until I felt okay. But I really thought that it was something I had eaten, not this. So I took it again yesterday. In three hours I began to vomit again with the fever and chills. This is definitely not for me. I'm so disappointed. Maybe it was just a bad batch, but now I'm afraid to ever try it again."
3,YUCK!,"I've been reading about the nutritional benefits of spirulina and decided to give it a try. I got the powder, thinking this would be easy to mix in with my fresh, homemade juices. Wow. This is the worst-tasting thing I have ever consumed. I gagged through the first few sips, then dumped it out. I don't care how healthy it is, I can't force myself to drink this. It's so dark green that it's almost black (meaning your beverage and teeth will be black!) and it doesn't dissolve easily without blending so the texture is awful, too. I expected it to smell like pond water, but EXPECTING and actually IMBIBING are two different things! I know that several reviewers have said they enjoy the taste, but I thought I'd offer my two cents for other ""newbies"" - try the tablets first! I'm throwing the powder away and ordering the tabs instead."
2,Faux Pacifica,"I researched it diligently, but fell for the oldest trick in the markerters book-the ""TM"" bait and switch. Apparently, Amazon wants to sell Spirulina Pacifica, but doesn't want to pay for it, so they named their Spirulina Placentisis Pacifica TM. Raw food books that I have read all recommend Pacifica over Placentisis (I hope I'm spelling them right). I'm sure they are both good, but I feel deceived-warren"
4,Spirulina Powder,"This is a really good product. Its a cheaper good quality alternative to Klamath Blue/Green algae! My whole family, even our pets love it!"
4,Great supplements,"Really like these supplements. The changes are slight and could be easily missed if you're not tuned in to your body, but I did notice more energy and my digestive system seems to function better."
2,Horrible taste but good energy,"I must say this is absolutely the worst taste for MY taste buds and therefore can not get it down no matter how diluted...anymore. I did give this 2 stars because the 3 times I managed to hold my breath and get this stuff down, it gave me this very clean energy if that makes any sense. I felt good and I suddenly craved a big garden salad instead of junk food for lunch which tells me if you can stomach the algae taste your going to feel a lot better physically over the long run. I LOVE my barley grass and hate wheat grass so I guess I just have sensitive taste buds! I will try to mix the 1 tsp. in my next green smoothie but the after taste will probably still be there."
5,Perfect,"Tables are the best option because they release content slowly, my previous brand was gel capsules and they release too soon. This forces you to have them before the meal to avoid the !burp! These are nice and bright, showing little or no binder, just perfect spirulina."
5,good quality + size,good quality product. better than many branded vitamins. really helps to maintain a good digestion system.the size is also perfect. there is no need to take extra antacids/digestive enzyme etc.
5,I like this!,I sprinkle this powder on my salads and it doesn't ruin the taste even though it has a strong smell when it is in the bottle.
4,More like Spirulina FANTASTICA,"I bought this product after hearing it mentioned in a documentary about super foods. Little did I know everything I'd heard about spirulina was true, AND MORE. Thanks to this product I am the hottest grandmother on the block!"
4,Spirulina Pacifica,Good product; easy to swallow; I would recomment this product and buy it again. This is a very nutritional supplement.
4,Works well in Fedora Linux,I was able to put this into my Linux machine and put two windows disks into it with no problems.
4,Easy to install,No issues other than it was not clear that the Vista driver would work for Win7 or Win8. Otherwise fully compatible.
1,"May tone your muscles, but also causes wrinkles!","I think this book is terrible. These exericises ""might"" tighten some muscles of your face, but the way they are done would no doubt cause wrinkling. The descriptions of the exercises are vague such as ""position your tongue and jaw"". Huh? The pictures are not very good at showing you exactly which muscles you are supposed to be working either. In addition, they look ridiculous and not as though they would work the intended area. The pictures look like an out of work actress who enjoys looking at herself make faces in the mirror. I was totally disappointed."
2,Review for Timeless Face,I seem to be in the minority when it comes the worth of Timelies Face. Timelies was a typo error but I have decided to leave it because it about sums up this book.
2,facial exercises,"I would not recommend this book. The pictures aren't very good. There is no diagram of the facial muscles, only names. So, unless you have a medical background, this does you absolutely no good. I have purchased other books on this subject and this is my least favorite. It's going to the resale shop."
1,Warning: Use this Book and You'll Look Like the Woman in the Picture,"What were they thinking? This book uses 1 model and only 1 model to show how to do these facial exercises (for a younger looking face) but the model looks old with a sagging face! And really wrinkly! (And it's not the model used on the cover)I cannot use this book because everytime I try to do the exercises I'm thinking, I'm going to end up looking like this old, wrinkly model--eek! (Is this model the author? If so, that says to me these exercises do not work, unless the woman in the book modeling the exercises is 250 years old, these exercises don't work)"
4,Fun for the actress in us!,"I got this book a few days ago and was disappointed at first glance -- the acupressure information was cursory and theChinese physiognomy aspect, which I would love to know more about, was pretty minimal. I settled down to the actual exercises today, however -- the pairing of emotion/phrase and photo makes it easier to ""get"" the subtle movements required than any meticulous step-by-step description of which muscle to move when. This is ""method face-lifting,"" you might say -- think yourself into the attitude and you're doing the exercise. It's intuitive and it's fun -- certainly worth a try. Make a video and I'll buy that, too!"
4,Good but not as good as NASCAR Heat,"This is a good NASCAR game. If it wasn't for NASCAR Heat I would say that this is a great game. Unfortunately for the folks at EA Sports, NASCAR Heat is a much more realistic game that has tons more features than does NASCAR Thunder 2002. I have both games and I find myself playing NASCAR Heat much more often. If you only want one NASCAR game and you consider yourself a fan of NASCAR, spend your money on NASCAR Heat and you won't regret it."
5,Finger numbing!,"This is the best racing game out there. You can choose from over 40 cars and 20 race tracks. There is a season mode and a career mode. In career mode you can create your car from scratch, pick your own sponsor's and earn money which could be used to modify your car. It also has the most realistic damage that I have ever seen."
4,Synthpop: a diamond in the rough!,"Out of all of over produced music out in the scene right now, this is unique. It's got a little bit of everything: upbeat, mellow, and some where in between. Loved it! I am definitely a synthpop fan now and foreva!"
3,Modern Pet Shop Boys,"This CD is a must have for fans of The Pet Shop Boys. It is amazing how much the singer sounds like Neil Tennant. If I didn't know better I'd swear I was listening to a PSB CD. The music here has an early 80s disco feel rather than the modern Synth sound, which isn't entirely bad if that is what you are looking for. But conspicuously missing from this CD is their soon-to-be Christmas classic Mary's Boy Child, which can be found on ""Red Letter Day, A Synthpop Christmas"". That song is arguably their best track."
4,Really enjoyable Synthpop,"Rename - touching thoughtful vocals, definitely club worthy. In a similar space as the Echoing Green. Favorite tracks are You Don't Deserve My Love, Me Versus You, and Stay. Check it out!!"
4,Great bounce,"Doesn't always want to stay on, slips occasionally, but I can work with that. Price is right. Works well otherwise."
2,"Deluxe? You call this ""Deluxe""?","Regardless of your opinion of the album ""Bat Out Of Hell 2: Back Into Hell"",(I happened to enjoy it a lot!) this ""Deluxe Edition"" is ridiculous. Most, if not all, of the tracks on the second CD have long been available on promotional singles. These promo singles were produced in such large quantities that they found their way into used CD stores everywhere, never becoming rarities. Most of these tracks aren't even remixes, but rather edits. So, on this bonus CD, you don't get more, you get less of each track. This is one of the most padded and useless ""Deluxe"" reissues that I've seen in some time. There were rumours that this reissue was going to be cancelled, which would have made sense, but evidently they're going ahead with it. If you have the original CD, save yourself the added expense of acquiring this little extra bit of fluff. 4 stars for the original album itself, 0 stars for the second CD, for an overall 2 stars."
5,You will love it,Mr. Himes is a great wordsmith but he knows nothing about good music. If you like Meatloaf you'll love this collection.
3,"A cool Luthor, but weird pose","stuck in a simple pose. also without some kind of lighting behind him, he might look a bit silly with the 'glitter' molded inside his transparent parts. he also doesn't stand well on the generic stand that comes with him, and can fall, and I get the feeling his bald head would get scuffed easily and that would be unfortunate."
3,Bonerama live set from NYC - bring on the horns!,"This is a live CD (digipack) from the New Orleans band Bonerama, of a show in NYC. All instrumental, no vocals - mostly horns with drums and some guitar. The correct release information and track listing is:Artist: BoneramaFormat: CDYear: 2007Number of Discs: 1UPC: 765481220421Item Number: SRD122042Release date: 07/24/20071. Barrone2. It Don't Mean Nothing3. Chilcock4. Shake Your Rugalator5. Whipping Post6. The Wizard7. Less Is More8. Its Electric9. Crosstown Traffic10. Bone Up11. Blackout in New York City12. Chemical Assistance13. War PigsNot sure how or why the database record in Amazon is so messed up with the wrong track listing and wrong band name. Hopefully the correction submission with fix the issues.Otherwise, the CD is relatively good - I was surprised how much I liked it. Not something I would listen to all the time, but good stuff overall."
2,Didn't fit my phone,"The description said it would fit the Nokia N95, but it doesn't. Not sure how well it works for the phones it does fit, so I gave it 2 stars for at least showing up on time."
1,broken upon receipt,"Came in a baggie. Difficult to unravel and it took awhile to puzzle it out...once I figured it out, after all the frustration there was a piece at the top that connects to the hoop that was cracked making the chain unusable at one of it's most vulnerable points. There should be a separate wire, string or rope to isolate the top of the chain so it would be easier to readily hang around the rim of the hoop and immediately see such broken connections. I just went with a regular nylon net...less likely to break."
5,I Wish I lived in Elwood City!,"I absolutely loved this show! My kids loved it and Backstreet Fans loved it. It gives great music, fun and a good lesson about music. What I learned was that if you want people to hear your music and love it as much as you do, be prepared for them wanting more and more. Just because you're a popular band, doesn't mean you don't care about your music or your fans!I love you Marc Brown and Arthur for choosing the Backstreet Boys to represent this story so well!"
2,Most bizzarre Author Book ever,I checked this book out from the library and had to keep stopping while reading to pause at the gobsmacky weirdness of this book.It reads like an old scooby doo episode with an irrelevant cameo.
5,Fits Rock Band/Guitar hero microphones.,"I love RB and GH style games, and often use them as the center of parties. I purchased a cheap stand (~20 bucks) that didn't come with a clip. I purchased this clip because another reviewer said it worked with video game mics. It will be snug at first, but the rubber that the clip is made from is flexible and will adapt to your usb mics over time. Actually the snugness is kind of nice because the microphone stays in place when you rock out. Music video gamers will enjoy."
3,The 5 Greatest Hits by the Duprees...and 13 Fillers,"You have to love the Duprees 5 best known hits, from You Belongto Me, My Own True Love, Why Don't You Believe Me, Have You Heardto It's no Sin. Their forte of taking an old standard and stylizeit with their signature sax harmonics produced but 5 worthy efforts, as noted. You have to remember, however, that Dion and the Belmonts did much the same with even greater success. The Duprees really missed a golden opportunity to duplicate their successes with Where Are You, Goodnight My Love, Two Different Worlds and especially the Eddie Fisher hit, I'm Yours, which literally cried out to be Dupree-ized, but wasn't. Too Bad! Thus,the majority of these 18 ""Greatest Hits"" are really not that great."
1,disappointment,"My recent order included a CD by the Duprees. Since the CD had never been opened, I expected a high quality recording. Instead, the recording was of a very low quality, i.e. missing,skipping,and sticking. Impossible to listen to. Needless to say, I returned the CD to Amazon for a replacement."
2,The Duprees All time greatest hits CD audio,"I ordered this audio cd for my husband who has two songs on a Doo Wop VHS of the Duprees singing his favorite two songs.Since the cover said all-time greatest hits, I thought it would be great as a gift for him.He was totally disappointed. The cd had his two favorite songs. The rest he had never heard of or they had been recorded by other singers who did a much better job of recording the songs. Not worth the price."
5,Worked great with the system,"We purchased our monitor from babies 'r us, as our 25 weeker baby came home without monitors. We wanted something, just for our safety. The monitor works great and the two additional parent devices we purchased from amazon worked with it perfectly. Wejust added batteries and it linked up with the system. Its great having multiple monitors around the house so, you can just turn one on and off, as you enter/leave the room. You won't have to worry about breathing one every single step."
5,Stating The Obvious,"Sometimes you can read a book and wonder why it hasn't been done a hundred times before. George Brymer's ""Vital Integrities"" is full of obvious advice, but it is advice that is left out of most leadership tomes.The most significant of his six integrities to me is ""live by the values you profess"" as I find that is the one most overlooked by leaders. It is too easy to state the company line to the masses while you ignore the core values yourself.I can't recommend this book highly enough to anyone interested in improving them self as a leader. When you're finished, you'll be amazed at how obvious it all is."
4,buy it,project gotham is so far and all ways will be one of the best racing game on the xbox you can pump out your own tunes and at the same time drive like a pro what more can i say just buy it
3,Pretty good.,"This game is an ok game. The graphics are good, but the controls are horrible. It is not as good as Gran Turismo 3, but if you have a Xbox, this would be a good choice."
2,OK if you have nothing better to do.,"Althought the graphics in the game are very good as to be expected from this machine, I find the game as frustrating as 4X4 Evo 2. No Matter how many new cars you unlock the competition ( meaning the machine ) is virtually unbeatable. Yeah you win a few First places but, when it really counts there is no way you are coming in first. It's an entertaining game at best for the first hour or so then you simply become born of losing all the time. I rated this game at a two (2). I would've traded it in already but my 2 year old enjoys driving the car in the opposite direction and causing pile ups. So I guess the game is worth something after all."
3,not what I expected,"I got this game when I bought a bundle pack for the XBox, i had read the reviews and thought I was pretty lucky considering when you buy stuff at the BX like this you take a chance at what you get. However, after playing the game I decided it would be a ""bored, beat all the other games, don't feel like buying a new one right now so I'll play this"" type game. I prefer Gran Tourismo 3, I like the ability to modify the cars, plus GT3 has a much larger selection of cars........ I'd have to say, PS2 has so far beaten the XBox in the car simulation games, plus the tracks are kinda lame, but they have nice detail."
5,This game [is good],What can i say ? anything have been toldThis game is amazing in all aspectsGraphics: Car models are the most impressive of any game so much detail great texture quality . compared tp gt3 in ps2 Projecy gotham is superior in all aspect including backgrounds all so detailed life-like without jaggies or blurry textures as most ps2 games.Gameplay is the word challenge too much fun good balance between arcade like and simulation that makes the difference among this fun game and the boring gt3A must buy
1,Don't get this game,Everyone who owns an xbox are who is getting one don't buy this game. I bought my xbox today and I bought this game with it. It will only hold youre attention for about 10 minutes. The only thing I like about it is that you can spin out.Don't buy it gamers.
3,"Ok game, but not its best","Truely Microsoft could have done A LOT better on this title, the power of Xbox should be expressed within their own first racer at a launch, and I will say they didn't provide us with that. The game plays like any normal racer out there, but I do suggest another racer other than this one, it's rank and not my taste in a game. Replay value is fairly high and should keep you busy for a while, if you don't go to sleep first, rent before purchase."
1,Lamest of the Lame,I've played some very lame games but this game is realy bad.All the cars suck in the beginning and it takes FOREVER to unlock other cars. If I could I wouldn't give this game any stars. THIS GAME SUCKS!
1,This game stinks!,"this game is terrible, if you like racing games you'll still think this is bad. The driving physics are terrible, i stopped after 5 minutes because i couldn't take another moment of this. This is why you see 5 people selling this for 1 cent. they want to get rid of it."
2,Can't even touch Gran Turismo,"I bought this game and in short, I don't like. The gameplay is limited. Sure, the graphics are good and your car is realistically beat up at the end of the races, but there are many shortcomings. There aren't many tracks, cars or options to change. You can't mod cars. You don't have to earn licenses. You get Kudos points for slides, which I think is silly. Racing should be the point of the game. There are no sponserships or real circuits. Aside from the graphics, the game is just plain weak."
2,BAD HANDLING AND UNREALISTIC!,I hated the handling in this game its way to hard to make sharp turns and another thing are those stupid kudos points. U get points for being a flashy driver. Like how long u can skid for and stupid stuff like that. I only gave it 2 stars because of the ok graphics.
2,Much too hard,"This game is nice, has tons of cool cars, nice music, authentic tracks, and is absolutely NOT playable. The difficulty level is (even in ""easy"" mode) way too high, the racing itself is totally unfair (if you touch another car, you make a 180 in the wrong direction, if another car touches you, same thing, every time). Maybe I'm not Michael schumacer, but that was never the intention. If i play a game in ""easy"" mode, it is supposed to be easy! I buy a game to have fun, not to LEARN it first. By the way: The ""dozens of cars"" and ""hundreds of circuits"" must be UNLOCKED first, that means, the better you race, the more cars and circuits you get. I managed to unlock TWO cars and FOUR tracks!!! My recomnmendation for this game is: If you get a chance, test it before you buy it."
3,"Great game, not as good as the second though. (Obviousely)","No doubt that Project Gotham Racing is an extremely fun game, but it is just not as good as the second one. I will make this review in PRO/CON format. It is basically your average racing game with the addition of Kudos, which are basically points that you get for cutting sharp turns.PRO:1.Graphics are over average2.Audio (If you like rap)3.The idea of Kudos is pretty neat.CON:1.Not as many cars as PGR 22.Not as many maps as PGR 23.Not very realistic4.Not online5.Can get frustrating at timesThis game definetely gets a 5/5 in terms of how fun it is, but there is just way less features in this one then there is in the second PGR 2 which is the reason why i gave it a 3/5."
3,Comercials can be decieving...,"The one thing I can say is to rent it before buying. Luckly I didn't shell out [the money] because it is not worth it. The biggest prolem is you cannot customize the cars which will leave you wanting more. The game becomes increasingly difficult to an almost imposible point. I got boarded quikly and got the cheat to get all cars and levels. The cars are beautiful, but you do not buy them or customize them the way you want. The best par is the levels, there are an incredible amount and it is almost imposible to try them all."
4,"Different, yet fun","I have played all racing games from rad racer to the ever popular Gran Turismo series. However, I find that Gotham racing gives me what I want most from a racing game: the ability to have fun. Most people who say the game is difficult need to give it a really good look. Yes, you must unlock cars by gaining kudos but the game give you several opportunities to do so. Plus, some items are unlocked just by the amount of time you play and the number of miles you have in the game. Besides, what other racing games allows you to create your own music selection from cd's you ripped to the Xbox harddrive. This game rocks. Now back to jamming Mystikal while i tear up the streets of New York."
4,2 Thumbs Up !,"Solid Racing Title. I'm not a big racing guy, but I very entertained by Project Gotham Racing. Great Graphics, lots ofreplay value and the music was solid as well."
3,Not as good as Gren Turismo for ps2,"This Game is fun to play for about the first 30 minutes after you get it, but the fact that you can't acquire new cars unless you unlock them is quite frankly aggrivating. I like the way Gran Turismo 1,2,and 3 are set up better where you can purchase vehicles by making money in your races instead of having to finish first in all events to unlock everything (nearly impossible). I find it more fun to be able to buy and build your car instead of having purely stock vehicles.If you are looking for the ultimate driving challenge then this is the game for you. Not very suitable for a beginner at console racing, This game takes a lot of skill if you want any chance at all to get new cars after about the first 3 or 4 you unlock."
2,Game play is the worst!!!,"The cars are pretty to look at, but since you can't upgrade like PS2's Grand Turismo 3, all the cars are the same. The F40 is fun to drive but spins so bad, you wish for a good set of sticky tires. But your stuck with what Microsoft thinks is a good driver. NOT!!!"
2,Impossible,I rented this game and it was WAY TOO HARD..... I played in easy mode and granted I'm not some video game expert but I managed to only unlock one (yes one) car. Do you know what that car was???? A freakin Volkswagon Beetle.... Very discouraging. After 3 or 4 hours of playing and bronze medals across the board I gave up and returned this one back to Blockbuster. The graphics were nice though. If you must believe all of the hype on this one rent it first.
2,not that great,I'm a big fan of car racing games and I was disappointed with Project Gotham. My biggest complaint is having a car racing game with a kudos point system where the race is determined by how flashy you drive. That's fine to have for something like Tony Hawk. But a racing game? C'mon!! That's just a stupid idea. My other complaint is that it doesn't feel like I'm driving a car. The handling is unrealistic. You can't damage the cars either. I give it 2 stars because the graphics are good and I like the feature where you can pick the music you want to listen to (by real bands by the way).
3,Pretty Decent,"I was a little disappointed with the gameplay with this game. All in all, I gave it 3 stars. If you are just looking for a racing game, you will probably like it. Howver, if you are looking for something with some type of missions involved, you need to look elsewhere."
2,Not playtested,"This game is an excellent demo of the power and capabilities of the X-Box, and really shows off the power of this console. Unfortunately, as a game, Project Gotham Racing suffers from a difficulty factor that does not progress logically. You will need to use the cheat code to see the exotic cars, because after mid-way, the game gets far too hard and cars that would help you pass the higher levels do not unlock in a logical order. There really is no excuse for a game being this difficult at the higher levels, and I seem to recall Microsoft PC games suffering from this same oversight. The game is excellent in all other ways, but this is such a huge problem that it renders the game unenjoyable, unless you use the cheat code. I personally don't see the point, and it turns what would otherwise be a 5 star review into a 2 star review. I don't recommend this game. Rent it, but don't buy it."
5,Good racing game,"When I first got this game (I bought the X-Box system as a package and had to get three games) I thought it would be a Grand Trismo rip off. I was wrong. Time matters very little in this game, rather it isn't how fast you do the course, but how well you do it. With a point system that calls apon you do to various tricks that can increase you score and medals being based on that, its a refreshing change from the ""I have a need for speed games"". Not that there's anything wrong with them, but a change is nice every once and a while.Then there are the sound tracks, you can make your own. With the X-Box being able to be used as a juke box, the game can pull the riped tracks off the systems hard drive and you can play what ever you like. The DJ in the radio function does get anoying after a while but he/she has a lot of different saying and only rarely repeats him/herself. I'm just suprised that they didn't put ads in the radio function for Microsoft products, new games..etc."
3,"Well, it ain't GT3, but it's a racing game","I LOVE GT3...but have played it almost through, and wanted a new racing game. The other reviewers are correct: It's annoying to have to unlock all these cars, the simulation physics aren't there, and the kudos points system is goofy...the art is in NOT making the car slide! Sheesh.But hey...it's racing. And if you enjoyed Ridge Racer 5 on PS2, you'll enjoy this too. It's certainly an excuse to own an X-Box."
5,ugh....(Yes I have this game),"I'm just sick of some people. I'm not going to compare this game to anything else. If you have an XBox and you like racing games, you have to buy this game. There's so many different challenges and so much to unlock that this game seems to just last forever. Unlocking everything is purely the fun of it all. Even though the tracks can just be a couple different turns there's still a great amount of diversity(yes there are over 200 track layouts). It definitely starts to become very hard, but withthe built-in 65 tracks of music or so you'll never get bored. I'm don't know what the heck people are talking about. Plus you can use all of your own songs as well. This is definitely one of the better racing games no matter what some people think."
3,"""Too little, too early""","This game was a great launch title for the system. But unfortunatly the number of cars you can take advantage of are very low. Graphics are perfect, there is semi realistic damage done to the cars when hit and they do handle like the actual cars, but I don't recomend this game to anyone who is not a car lover and understands the handling of these types of cars."
4,"It's no GT3, but gameplay and challenge are tops!","Although Project Gotham Racing was an original launch title for Xbox, it doesn't disappoint. Lots of gameplay modes and tracks (divided over 4 cities: San Francisco, New York, Tokyo, and London), as well as weather effects and car damage, keep this game's replay value and challenge factor high. The later stages (and achieving Golds) start getting a bit overwhelming even for the veteran gamer, but it still maintains a decent AI. Where the game falls short on realism, it gains an exceptional edge in arcade-style 360's and jumps that not many racing games offer. Sim Games may be amazing in reality, but let's all get back to our roots and remember the reason we started playing video games was arcade platformers and racers! A solid game with lots of great and *useful* (my only complaint about GT3) dream cars, you won't be disappointed! :)"
3,Decent racing game but something's missing,"Don't get me wrong, this game is a decent game but definately not as good as people said it was. It is extremely hard and isn't very exciting to me. As the race wears on, it begins to get boring and the races seem repetative. This game has it's strong points as well. The ability to play your own music is a big bonus (for me at least) and the graphics are good. There is a great amount of cars like a Dodge Viper, Aston Martin Vanquish, and many others. This is a great bonus for car fanatics like me. Is Project Gotham worth [$]? I highly recommend you rent it before you buy it.Pros:- Graphics- Amount of cars- Music abilitiesCons:- Hard- Repetative- Somewhat boring"
1,Same team as MSR,"remember MSR for dreamcast. Obviously not, if you cam to the buying screen. It was an awkward racing game, boasting innovative ideas, that failed. The graphics were nice, but the game wasn't fun. I instintly was reminded of that game while reading about Project G. Then i read it is the same development team. ..."
4,"Totally addicting, but not perfect","After playing PGR for about 8 hours I have to say that this is a very fun game. Once I got over the initial problem of controlling the car I couldn't stop playing. I found that the best camera mode for enjoying this game was looking out the windshield, rather than looking from behind the car. When I changed the camera angle it changed the dynamics of the game completely. You could tell the difference in speed and I actually had better control of the car using the behind the windshield camera angle.Couple of things I didn't like were that there was no computer controlled cars in the multiplayer mode and I also found a bug that when you play in multiplayer mode and have to pause the game, that the game loses track of how many laps you have completed in the race.Other than these minor gripes, once I changed the camera angle and learned to control the car it was awesome driving all of the different vehicles and really feeling the speed and the beautiful graphics."
3,Its tough!,"Fun game, but it gets frustratingly tough later during the play. And winning gold medals is way too difficult, unless you're a ace driver.Cranky AI. For example, the AI cars will follow an ideal path and if you get in their way, you better be ready for a full on crash from them. Or in many tracks the AI cars will whip around a particular bend a particular way and again if you're in their way... kiss the race good-bye.I've had it for a few weeks now, but i'll trade it in today for the new PGR2. Hopefully it'll be a little more intelligent."
1,horrible!,"when I got this game I though it would be as good as need for speed:hot pursuit and other need for speed games, but unfortunately it was a very lame game. 1.In the last level of the quick race it has taken me forever to be able to win. 2. There are very few cars then other racing games. 3. Most of the cars you unlock will not have very good handling. 4. I have noticed from hours of trying to pass the last level of quick race that the computer in the game somehow when you are driving on a straight road and your close to winning your car for some reason spins out of control and your lose the race. This game was a very lame racing game. My friends have said that this games is very bad too. I was expecting more of this game."
3,OK racing game...,"This is an OK game, I personally don't like the fact you can't crash. I would recomend Need for Speed for a more relistic game. The graphics are perfect! If you don't mind non-realistic games...then I would definatlly buy it!"
4,Too much time but a great game,"I bought this game about four days ago and have played it for about 10 hours. Just the fact that I can play it that much tells me it's a great game, however, in that 10 hours I have only unlocked 8 tracks and 2 cars (and a couple helmets). The game gets ridiculously hard after you get all the silver medals. The graphics are amazing and the courses are a lot of fun, I just wish unlocking new stuff was easier. All in all fun to play for one or multiplayer, very pretty, and...challenging."
1,What Were You Thinking?,"This game is one of the worst racing games ive ever played,its got good music and ok graphics but the actual game... why would they give u fast cars,if all u do is turn corners every second,why would they call thier game a racin game the average speed i went on every course was like ten miles per hour. ...dont buy it..."
2,Pretty Bad,All the cars are cool. But the cars are VERY hard to control!! I don't recomend it at all.
2,Subpar,"What a disapointment. The hype is unfounded. The graphics are great, the gameplay is just average and boring. The game gets stale after a few hours of play. It's annoying that you have to unlock even the most modest cars."
3,hmmmm....,"a lack of imagination and graphic sparkle (yes, ever played the need for speed series on a P4?) leave this title a bit overrated. don't get me wrong, it's pretty and not as annoyingly complex as the GT series, but the circuits priovide little visual variety and those special touches like rain on your winshield more realistic (and hindering) damage are missing. Also why do i get ""kudos"" for spinning out as long as I dont hit a wall?... fun, but there are, and will be better racing titles soon and often."
2,EXTREMELY hard and very repetitive.,My best advice is to spend your money on another game like Nascar Heat or MX 2002. Because this game is just WAY WAY too hard and there is almost no motivation to play it other than the flashy graphics and cool cars so only get it if you are into that stuff and even then it is a gamble.--Pulse
2,Project Gotham Ricing - another great game,"here is another prime example of a great game. yes, i am a fan of the racing genre, but this is a great game regardless. the grafics are amazing, the driving physics are the best i have seen, and it has the MINI Coopers S, whish is my fav. car... if you have an xbox or are just thinking about getting one i recomend this game to anyone."
2,"Great Cars, Impossible difficulty, Poor though not Bad game",The cars are sweet. The graphics are sweet. Too bad racing is just ... in here. This game is wayyyy too hard. I cant even get past some of the tracks in easy difficulty. Not a good game though you gotta love the cars
2,I hate this game.,"I love racing games but hated this one. Sure, the graphics are terrific but the gameplay and control is terrible. I got sick of slamming into the buildings all the time on the turns. And what's with this ""earning kudos"" [stuff]? I got a code to unlock all the cars, and even driving the Ferrari F50 wasn't all that fun. Nascar Heat and Nascar Thunder are much more fun racing games."
5,Amazing looking and GREAT gameplay,"You've GOT to have this game. It is the best looking game I've ever seen. The graphics blow EVERYTHING on PS2 away. There are a ton of cool songs (you can even choose your radio station in each city!), a ton of cool cars, and a ton of cool tracks. Flying through London in a Ferrari F50 is awesome!"
2,Go get Rallisport Challenge,"PGR is second rate compared to Rallisport. Rallisport is more fun, better graphics, better sound, better controls.PGR does have cooler cars thought because most of them are consumer cars as opposed to just Rally cars, which most people have never heard of. The background in PGR are very boring and stagnant, hurried to get done before release date."
4,Great tool if you need it,"It does what I expect it to do. My cell tower is about 30 miles away, barely usable without this booster. The indoor and outdoor antennas need to be separated as much as possible and the outdoor antenna needs to be as far from your phone as possible for any system like this to work best. Sometimes my phone needs to be ""rebooted"" to make the best connection, otherwise I get complaints that my signal is breaking up, as the phone doesn't fully connect to the booster if I walk into the bubble with the phone already on. Make sure to protect the amp with good quality surge suppressors on both the AC line and the outdoor antenna, lightning kills."
3,Type of connectors,This unit uses the N type connectors. You must use N type cables and antennas or get adapters. I returned this for a different model that has F connectors.
3,Works but with reservations,My buddy bought this with a total RV kit. His was broken so we never new if it worked. So I bought mine and tested it in the Everglades. It worked BUT.... I had to stick my MiFi card right in front of it for the bars to go up to full bars. I have a Motorola Droid and he has a different Droid. When you go into signal mode you are looking for a negative # -50 is better than -95. Unless I put my phone right next to the antenna the number would not boost. My Buddy Droid went right to full power. So Phones make a difference
1,Thermaltake Mozart Sx HTPC Case,I bought this product to house a self assembled HTPC because it appeared to look good and reviews said it was quite. They also said it was lower and wider than the standard HiFi component. I failed to appreciate this last point sufficiently. After a year I decided to replace this unit because it was too noisy (even after I added new low db fans and interior insulation) and it's excessive width grew frustrating in trying to place it in my system. It's 1 star rating is mainly because of it's noise-if it had been quieter I would probably have lived with it's excessive width.Thermaltake Mozart Sx VC7001SNS Media LAB ATX/MicroATX Desktop PC Case (Silver/Black)
4,Little workhorse,"If you can live without an electric brake, than this is the drill to own. I only use it, where cordless drill wont do. I've built 3 decks (average 500 2 inch screws each)using this baby and it has performed without any problems. It has no rubber grip, so put a glove on before an all day job."
1,chuck jammed,Chuck jammed and no procedure will loosen the drill bit. Totally jammed. This unit is badly designed. It'll go in the garbage.
1,Didn't apply to me (first year prof with Ph.D),"I thought this book was overpriced. I did not learn anything new. The book seems to be best suited for someone entering academia in the hard sciences, who has not attended conferences or participated in academia at all in the past."
3,Best for those in the medical sciences,"This is a clearly written, comprehensive overview of what it takes to succeed if you are an academic in a medical field. It follows each topic with a vignette of an imaginary junior researcher who is struggling with various career issues. The book tries to aim for a general academic audience, but it will be of little help to those in the humanities. As a psychologist and professional coach to academics on the tenure track, I recommend this book to grad students, post-docs and junior faculty in the hard sciences, especially medical research."
1,This Game (is bad),First this game looked awesome but when I played it (...) .Its so boring and the graphics (...). Its really ok but compared to NFL FEVER it bites. It is also pretty confusing to start a mode or something.
3,"Alright, but its no NFL 2K2","This game is an ok football game. The EA fans will probably buy it just because its EA and dont want to admit the fact that SEGA and Visual Concepts make better sports games, but let them play EA games. SEGAs NFL2K2 is much better in my personal opinion."
4,Madden 2002 on X-box good overall but missing a key point,"I got... and watched the Xbox simulate a game between the Packers and Bucs in Lambeau in a blizzard. It looked so real that I could have may as well been watching TV. The graphics are great. The game is like other versions of Madden for overall controls and options, but there are some additional details and things which make 2002 a really good football game. But there are two major weaknesses to the game: 1-there is no create your own player feature in the game. You can create a custom team and edit the jersey and mascot, but you must use exisiting NFL players to fill your roster. This is a big downer. 2-The music in the game... It's laid back and dull. This is supposed to be football!!! The game is good but not great because it does have it's few shortcomings. But for a football fan, it's still worth the buy."
2,holding penalties are ridiculous,Great graphics and some very realistic features but I am furious over the number of holding plays I keep getting especially when I use a superior team over another i.e. the all madden team vs. a regular team. The regular team rarely gets called for holding while I get called nearly a third of the time and on running downs. THAT IS BULL PLOP.The commentary also needs a lot of work on better coordinating and adding many more so we don't hear the same thing over and over.Also there are waaaay to many receivers dropping the ball on well thrown passes.
4,Decent title,"If you want to get in depth with a game, this is it. Great simulation... you won't be able to immediatley join a game and have a chance at beating someone who has played a while... it'll be no competition."
4,Great Game,The graphics and gameplay for Madden are wonderful. It is the most realistic sports game I have ever played. It is challenging - unless you are on rookie mode - and fights you for every yard.The biggest complaint I have with the game is that there is nowhere to practice defense or at least a description of the defensive plays. I just guess and I don't like that.
3,NFL FEVER IS MORE INJOYABLE AND MORE FUN,"Like I said , Fever is more injoyable and fun. Yes, the graphics on Madden is tight and it looks cool, but it is so boring. Everytime I play I can't wait til the game is over. Even the entrances are cool but it's no fun at all."
2,worst football game ever played,"this game wasn't the best. The players have huge heads and the graphics look are not great,looks the same as ps2's madden. If you haven't bought this game on ps2 than don't buy it on xbox. don't waste your money on madden on xbox. If you want a football game I would buy nfl 2k2, or nfl fever."
4,Useful,"I found this book very useful, some if it is quite basic but overall it explains some useful tips regarding email etiquette which may not be obvious to everyone."
4,"music great, remastering shoddy","Beware of this product. While the amount of music is more than generous and the booklet info comes with complete discographical info, the sources from which the music is drawn and the remastering have unfortunately not been done with the love and care one usually associates with e.g. JSP, HEP, Living Era or Vocalion. While I don't mind the surface noise on some of the earlier tracks (with Leo Reisman, Paul Whiteman and Casa Loma) there is evidence of added reverb and pseudo stereo on many of the later tracks with Eddie Condon and Jess Stacey (some can be compared to the four disc Eddie Condon set on JSP where these defects are not present).The music however is non-pareil, Wiley being a wonderfully foggy voiced singer (Mel Tormé's sobriquet 'Velvet Fog' perhaps suited Ms Wiley even better), her understated delivery the lid on a volcano seething with passion.The music is deserving of five stars, the presentation of three."
3,A Little Disappointed,"I was disappointed in this tape and a companion tape ""Healing Yoga for Aches & Pains."" They are nothing more than beginning tapes. I was looking for specific recommendations/instructions for specific problems which they did not provide, but newcomers to Yoga might find some basic information of value."
3,Good overview,It's short. A little superficial. It's definitively old fashion in terms of production. It provides with basic helpful information if you will visit for the first time (not my case). It can help you to get an appetizer of the region in a very concise portion. It's not a documentary.
3,H.P. 3,"This game is easily beaten but is fun while it lasts. Some opponents are easy, and some are hard, for example, Lupin had great attacks, but those snail things didn't, it is a game that you rent, not buy, besides, what's the point of beating iit twice!!!???"
5,Funnest one!,"I have all the Harry Potter computer and GBA games. This one is the funniest that I've played out of all of them. If you don't want to buy them all (you should), then buy just this one!Twilight Sucks."
3,Very Linear Game - though entertaining...,"This game isn't one where you can wander round at will and really jump into different quests when you want to, it has a very set sequence of what you have to do and is one quest at a time. It was entertaining though, as linear as it was, but not that challenging."
3,"A game worth buying, but",Pros:-fun-a lot of leveling up possibility-a lot of spellsCons:-very short no matter how much sidetracking you do (I did as much as possible)-the prizes for collecting cards are crappyConclusion: definitely worth playing.
4,it's okay depends on what you are looking for....,"if it is a game that you are saving up your $ for:... don't get this... cause im like now to have my GBAsp and i finnished it in seven hours and secsounds so if you are looking for that i would give it two stars...if you have a lot of$ and are jus looking for fun...:this is THE game for you! this game is fun and i could not stop playing it! i was like constantly on it! in my bed, while watching tv, secretly playing it in my classroom!if that is what you want the it would be five stars!if you are looking for quality....:this is an OK game.... good music...but really bad graphics!!(...)!like this is a disgrace to the GBA title! so for that i would givethree stars!i give this game four stars cause i don't like the graphics but other than that it's all good!"
4,Good Product,"This is a good product that performs well, but a similar product can be purchased at a cheaper price elsewhere."
2,There's better stuff on YouTube,"This video has edited versions of railroad promotional films from the 1940's and 50's. Save the two bucks and check on YouTube for The Nickel Plate Story, Operation Fast Freight, Rolling the Freight, A Great Railroad at Work, Big Trains Rolling and Super Chief."
4,good railroad flic,My husband loves any kind of train movies. This shows the older trains. Probably would watch it again. Something different.
1,Three stars - Much to generous!,"The reviewer of this ""Old propaganda documentary"" is much to generous awarding three stars.Simply put. One star is much too generous! Not only should this a zero star be offered free - Amazon should offer to pay us to watch it!"
4,"Superb visual, no commentary","almost no comintary. Book full of pictures (which are excellent) with small niotation of artist. No references as to when each cover was produced, for what story, etc"
4,Excellent version,It is helpful to have this on ereader. I use this not as a student but as a student in a clinic who needs quick referencing for clients. I hope to use it as a young lawyer as well
4,saved my butt on multiple occasions,this book saved my bacon on a few occasions. Great reference if your confused about certain aspects due to a horrible casebook.
3,"helpful, but why so small?","as a law student, this was very helpful in explaining immigration law and statutes in every day language. however, i found its small size very irritating. i understand that it's a ""nut shell,"" but the large font on small pages required me to constantly flip through multiple pages for just one topic."
4,useful book,"The book came in the condition described by the seller. It gives useful information about how to interpret sections of the INA. I wanted a book that would tell me how to navigate through the INA. Although this book does not help in that sense, I still find that it is very useful."
3,"Gives a general overview, not for beginner, not for pro.","I work for a law firm and am planning on going to a law school. I got into the immigration field by pure accident but I had a great deal of research done through working on actual cases. This book gives a very good general overview of the immigration law and procedure, but it does not list the details of ""HOW?"" only some of ""WHY?"".If you are a beginner, if will be hard for you to start reading althought it will be a better than reading INA or 8 CFR. If you have a intermidiate immigration back ground, why do you even bother looking at books like this? just dive into INA & 8 CFR.Also, go check out AILA and Lexis Nexis Web-sites."
1,x tremely bad rubbish,best to buy a good fiction book to read rather than rubbish by this author. It makes claims but has absolutely no evidence to back up any thing it writes hence the ommission of its name or gender.As a so called high level x intelligence officer has very poor writting skills and high lack of detail in his story book.
3,Not for DW746,"This is the stock blade comes with DW746 table saw. For that class of table saw, you would expect a better blade. The blade just does what it's supposed to do - cuts wood. Nothing fancy or impressive. Once it's set up right, It cuts pretty well. The cut surface is not very smooth though, some tear out when crosscutting. For that price, a Systi-matic 50-tooth combo blade has more bang for the buck."
2,This is a good book for your home but not for your office.,This is a fun book to have at home. You can browse and look for fun sites. But it's not a book to have at your business. It's not very helpful.
3,Very informative and interesting,"I gave it 3 stars because it has adult websites listed in it. There were also other websites that wouldn't be appropriate for kids to surf on. If you have kids in your house, you may want to either rip the pages out or talk to them about just going on appropriate websites that they can look for etc. I also thought he could of listed more websites on certain subjects such as Bookstores on the Internet [....] Interesting quotes are included and the cd-rom was cool because I just can click on the link and it would take me to that website."
1,Doesn't Worth the Money,"I bought a copy and then returned it. It's basically a personal selection of web sites that the author prefers. I don't think it should be called ""Yellow Pages"". I definitely prefer the ""Que's Official International Internet Directory"" (by Marcia Layton Turner et al.) which has a lot more web sites listed and trully qualify for the title ""Yellow Pages""."
2,"Brilliant films, stupidly remastered","Having waited faithfully for years for a good HD and Blu-Ray remastering of these wonderful films, I was delighted to discover that Criterion had finally made a new master available. Unfortunately, whoever did the remastering didn't bother to learn anything about the films before doing the work. As a result, he/she/it not only removed imperfections from the prints, but also did away with the filters Inagaki used for his night scenes. In the second film, the result is monstrous. All the scenes at night (the ambush at the bridge, the climactic battle at the temple) are no longer drenched in the beautiful and haunting blue tints that Inagaki used to such effect in preparing the film. Now everything looks like broad daylight, even a battle set at midnight. Criterion deserves to be savaged for the sheer carelessness of releasing the films in this form."
4,a little darker than the film was,"We have tried both the VHS and the DVD and they are about the same. We feel that the darkness of the recording might be because we have a rear projection TV and that with the newer plasma screens the color could possibly be just fine. This is a classic film with beautiful photography and acting. Well worth owning, just be aware of the problems with the older screen TVs. I highly recommend it inspite of the problem."
4,5 Star Trilogy! 3 Star DVD quality,"The Samurai Trilogy is excellent and a must see for anyone interested in Japanese history, culture or samurai. It's truly an epic. The only bad thing is the dvd quality. They films appear on dvd to be TOO DARK! You will have to turn the brightness up all the way on your t.v. settings. And some of the scenes look really ugly and should have been cleaned up.The Samurai Trilogy is in dire need to be digitally remastered.But I guess it's still worth buying."
5,Wait till June!,"Hello Fans! Criterion is reissuing this box set June 26th! I have been dissatisfied with the original quality of these epic films (and one of the people who kept nagging Criterion to re-release them), so a new box set is definitely a happy development. If any of you saw the old version of Seven Samurai compared with the new reissue, you know what you can expect from Criterion! Pristine image! No more grain and blurry picture that is so prevalent in these old films, or at least I hope not! A new movie-watching experience. I have pre-ordered mine from Amazon (you can check it out on the Criterion website also), and if you are thinking about getting this box set, you should too! Hope I could be of some help to anyone. Peace, and let the Legend live on!"
4,Not the whole story.,The Samurai Trilogy is very well done even with a few very slow segments to show Musashi's efforts to be 'culturalized.' The Trilogy ends with his sword fight with Sasaki Kojiro and I was hoping that the whole story would be told to his final days. What happens to Otsu?
4,Yoshikawa 's novel for the screen,"I really enjoyed reading Eiji Yoshikawa's book Musashi. It's a wonderful journey filled with some incredible characters and more twists than you can imagine. The Samurai trilogy starring Toshiro Mifune is a good rendition of the book, although it misses alot of the builds, drama and character development. It's deinitely worth addiing to your ""Samurai collection""."
1,Morons dubbing the subtitles,"If you are thinking of buying the janus vhs tape, save your money. What idiot would make the sub-titles the same color as the background. Three quarters of the subtitles are unreadable. And the ones you can read are on the screen for a milli-second. This is an idiotic release that I got bought and got screwed . Don't waste your money !"
3,Duel at Ganryu Island,"Overall, I found this to be a good, entertaining samurai movie, but would not consider it to be excellent as many claim. I have yet to see part II, and it has been some time since I saw part I, which was not all that impressive. Part III, therefore, is an improvement. But the story ultimately fails to be engrossing, and at times the acting on the part of some of the lesser characters leaves much to be desired. And in the end, the fight scene between Musashi and Sasaki really is not all that great--and I actually found it somewhat humorous when the victor states that his opponent was the best he ever faced. Mifune was, however, great, and for this alone it was well worth watching the movie."
4,"Excellent film, bad transfer","While I agree with the other reviewers that the culmination of Inagaki's Samurai trilogy is a wonderful film, I feel that this DVD can't truly be rated at five stars. The reason for this is that the transfer on the disc (and the other two in the series) simply doesn't do justice to the film's beautiful cinematography. The colors are muted in most scenes, often shift from scene to scene, and the film itself is frequently scratched or pitted.However, it's doubtful that these fantastic films will receive a better transfer any time in the near future, so be sure to see them, but be warned that the transfer is sub-par (although it's certainly watchable)."
5,Rich cinematic experience,"The recent Last Samurai seems more an Eastern Western action movie vehicle for Tom Cruise compared to Mr Inagaki's wonderful trilogy. In the latter the combination of consistently believable mis en scene including deep rich colour, framing, pacing, composition, costume, music make for a thoroughly entrancing and enchanting cinema experience. In terms of plot, yes there is the journey of learning of the hero, but it is as much a love story as it is a journey. The acting and action sequences (using the less is more technique with power added by the viewer's imagination) are consistently excellent and the totality of the films make for a rich cinematic experience. Definitely worth owning."
3,a good conclusion to a trilogy,"This review is for the Criterion collection edition of the film.As all films in the trilogy, they are good but come with almost no bonus material for DVD. The only have the essays in the accompanying jackets and the the theatrical trailers.The film itself has less action than the second film with only 2 major sequences. The scene of bandidts pillaging a town and the climatic duel scene at the end of the film.This film also has an excellent scene where Musashi uses his chopsticks to catch flies in midair. This scene appears to be the inspiration for a very similar scene in the first Karate Kid film.Overall the films were good but not great."
3,"Good movies, but yes, too damn dark.","These are very entertaining movies and well worth watching (They have more than just entertainment value as well. They have a good story and excellent choreography). Watching them depends on you having the ability to increase the brightness (contrast and color too) of your player. If you can't do that, do not buy these movies. The movies will likely just frustrate you.Hopefully someday someone will release these with more care put into the finished product. Until then, you'll have to jack up the brightness."
4,Excellent history lesson,"Unless you are a Toshiro Mifune fan or a Musashi Miyamoto fan you probably won't appreciate these films. The movie is a very accurate account of the life of the greatest samurai to ever live, Musashi Miyamoto. The fight seens are few but great when they happen. It demonstrates Musashi's way of thinking and how he grew into the great man that he died as. After you see the movies read his Book of Five Rings."
2,Poor video quality detracts from the enjoyment.,"Out of the 3 discs, why is this one so poor in transfer quality in comparison to the other 2? I suppose Criterion could not find the original film masters from which to make a proper digital transfer? This one is a poor, low-grade VHS-era transfer slapped onto the DVD. The first 2 episodes were great, I was able to really see the depth in the colours as well as the quality of the cinematography. I was truly disappointed that this 3rd disc came from some poor tv/video transfer and nothing was done to it. May be the original negs were no longer available?"
4,"It's not brilliant, it's brilliantly clever.","About the first episode there isn't much to say; Oscar for the best foreign film and so on, it is really, really brilliant. In the other two episodes however, things do change a little. The action is a bit slow and sometimes ""jumpy"". Like in the end of the 2nd one it looks like they run out of film (or money). The island duel in the third is very well solved. There you go, it's clever. Anyway, one star for each episode and one more for Toshiro Mifune."
3,"Some good things, Some bad things","I was at my school library when I saw this book and began to think ""This sounds interesting."" So I read it. It's an amazing book. But it's misguiding: most people believe that when you die, you either go to hell or heaven. this book shows no such places. and instead of God, there's this man at the computer who types in your information. If little kids read this, they can have mixed thoughts and feelings about death so don't have a kid read this unless they know the clear facts you want them to know. this book is fantastic, but it can misguide you about the afterlife. i know i was after i read it. i was thinking, ""where's God?"" so only read this book if you know your facts and for teachers, it might not be the best read aloud book"
2,Well-written but misguided,"I was very disappointed in this book. Coming from a Christian standpoint, I'd be worried about my kids reading this book and coming away with confused views of life after death. There is no mention of Heaven as most theologies teach it (The Great Blue Yonder could be construed as Heaven, although it's never spelled out as such), and no mention of God -- just a man who works at a desk and enters your information into a computer after you've died. It's so ludicrous. Regardless of your religion, I can't imagine that this book would mesh well with your beliefs. Most theologies have some type of Heaven in their views, and of course God. There is no mention of either in this book.On a more positive note, Shearer is a very engaging writer. I am just worried about what his views may be teaching kids who read his novel."
5,Good For a Laugh,"I enjoyed reading this novel. This book was filled with suspense and was also good for a laugh. Moni Lawrence packed up and left her small hometown in Virginia headed for San Diego, she has no idea what awaits her when she drives her car into the swimming pool of her new neighbor, handsome Grant Forrest. What lies ahead for the air-head from Virginia and the intellectual from San Diego is anybody's guess."
4,fun and easy,fusion frenzy is a definite game for kids it'll keep them busy for hours you should consider this game
4,this game rocks,"this game is totally worth the money! it's got great graphics, great sound and great competition for 1,2,3, or 4 kids!the only thing i found wrong with it was that some of the games were really stupidBUY IT!!!"
5,Fuzion Frenzy,"This is seriously the best party game I have ever played! awesome game.....Fuzion Frenzy 2 is a let down, but only because a different company made it. the original is an absolute classic!"
5,Love it,"The kids love this game and all their friends too, they play it all the time specially it could be more than 1 player."
2,"Buy HALO, and use the demo","The only really cool part about this game is 2 mini games, TWISTED SYSTEM and TAILBLAZER! They are sweet, they are both fun, and you can play them for hours...but they are already on the HALO game disc as a FUSION FRENZY demo, so keep your money and just play the demo on the HALO disc...everyone has HALO, so...enjoy"
4,great multi-player,Fun with a great variety of easy to learn but hard to master games with great graphics excellent controls and unique game play. Good varity of games.
3,xbox training,fusion frenzy is okay but it needs to have more to do like a career mode or create-a-character like tony hawks underground.the only thing this game is good for is training or parties with at least 2 to 3 people.it is mainly a kind of training game because the games are easy to learn and is made for some one new to xbox because it makes your button skills and reaction timing better.i dont have the game but i have the demo on halo and pgr2.i have however rented it before so i do know all the games.
3,Pretty Fun...but hard to tell who is who!,"Fusion Frenzy is a cool party game. Tons of games, tons of hours of entertainment. The only knock on it is that you're usually so far zoomed out from the action, if you blink you've lost track of who you are! That makes it hard when you're joking around and having fun with your friends. I guess it's meant to be for serious parties only?"
5,This game redfefines party games,"This has to be the best party game to date. One of the best parts of the game is the single player surprisingly, which offers twice the depth of Mario Party. But the best part is the Muiltiplayer. The games are incredibly fun and offers some classic arcade games with new spins, such as super sprint, marble madness, combat, and even Tron. I personally have enjoyed the Sumo the most! Anyways, this is a hopelessly addictive game that can be played and enjoyed by all gamers. Two thumbs up here."
4,This game is good,"I think this game is good. Not the best game I've ever played, but it's good. The first time I got Fusion Frenzy I was excited about how fun it was going to be, and it was fun! It was really fun playing it against my family members. I love being Samson because red is my favorite color. I don't really play it all the time only if friends come over and stuff. I would recommend this game, the mini games are awsome.BUY THIS GAME!"
2,I suppose it's a party game,"Be warned, if you are looking for a game similar to Tetris, Bust-a-move or any of the other very addictive multi-player games do not buy fusion frenzy.If you are looking for a game to play with many friends who have little skill on a gaming system then this is for you. There are an abudance of games, but many of them are similar to each other and the variation is no where near as great as it could be.Additionally, the one-player versions of the games are weak and are of little enjoyment to play alone.Bottom line is that if you choose to purchase this game no what you are getting, a game for people with little gaming skills that can be picked up very quickly. The graphics are good for what it is but make very little use of the xbox's potential.Good Gaming!"
4,Fun,"The game is fun.I especially like ""Twisted System"". Most of the games are fun, but some of them are too much alike."
1,Total Crap,"Don't wast $50 on this game. It should be included free with an XBox, even then it's too expensive. How did Microsoft let this game into the Xbox game inventory with such poor gameplay and lame graphics. My five-year-old even thinks this games sucks."
1,Failed Attempted Frenzy,"This game is not up to the standard of the other x-box titles. The graphics are bland, the landscapes are dull & boring. There are many other games being launched at the same time as this one. I would wait for something a bit more ""Next Generation""."
4,Very fun when playing with all 4 people,"If you have all four controllers and 3 other friends, you should get this game. I just bought this game along with three extra controllers. My family and i were going nuts. I have played this game before with others and for the most part it doesn't get old. If you like to go head to head with other gamers and talk trash, this is the game for you. There are over 40 different mini games to choose from. Many of the games are really alike, but it doesn't really matter because 90% are all fun. It is not for all tastes, but once you get into it, it's non-stop. Pretty soon you will be whooping and hollering with your buddies over simple little games. It's a pretty funny sight."
5,Great Party Game,I have to agree with most of the other reviews...This is a great party game. It's like one of those crazy Japanese gameshows where you are a contestant. Best if played with several competitive human contestants!
2,Meh,I Love playing this game with friends but it stops too much. i have to restart it several times and it takes several tries before i can play a full game :/ sadly.
2,"Great multiplayer game, but that's about it","This is a great party game, but beyond that it's a freakin` waste!`. First of all, you can't unlock any players/levels, your stuck with the same retarded six. Jet,Samson,Zack,Geena,and two wierd others. You'll get tired of the same games(there's like 50 games but most have the same goal)my advice only but it if your gunna have 3 to four friends over"
5,My favorite game for friends.,"The best game I ever played in a party setting. Not very enjoyable alone. The hip 'tude of the characters is a little annoying, but the originality of the sequences is unmatched. After I owned PS2, I played this at a friends then traded my PS2 for an Xbox, just to have this game."
4,Best Party Game Around,I thought the game was very good but the levels became very repetative and can become boring fast. It is very easy and the computer is cheap. If you are playing with friends it is veery amusing.
3,GOOD FUN WHEN YOUR ENTERTAINING GUESTS,FUZION FRENZY IS A PARTY GAME U NEED A CASE OF BEER AND A BOTTLE OF TEQUILA AT BEST.WHEN U DISCOVER THE 45 DIFFERENT GAMESTO PLAY YOUR BOUND TO FIND A FEW YA LIKE OR GET BLITZED PLAYING.AS FOR OVERALL ITS JUST ANOTHER PARTY GAME.
4,Yeah Baby!,"Well, I really enjoy playing this game. I recommend that you play it with more than just you. It is like a joust game where you have to beat the other players in about 40 different game settings. It is a blast."
3,Great if you dont play alone,"When I see this game I think of Mario Party, but without the maps and prizes. There are no levels to advance or missions, so if you play alone it can get kinda dull. I played with some family and it was a blast.The games themselves are challenging and exciting, but like I said theres no real point in winning, eventhough you rack up points and the player with the most points win, theres nothing else after that."
1,Don't buy this game,This game sucks!!! It is advertised as a party game and some of the events are kinda fun but the graphics are horrible. Looks like an old and primitive game. In most events the characters are so small and the depth perception is so bad that you can't figure out who you are and what you are supposed to do. Stay away from this game.
1,Broken out of the box?,"This thing will not hold time. I set it quite easily. I even checked the basic manual. Now everytime I touch alarm or time the alarm time or real time moves forward. How can you set anything like this? I could have gotten the one bad one, but if this is any indicator, you may want to avoid it."
3,Not as good as the MBM 5.1 disc,"This is from the same minds as the Meat Beat Manifesto DVD that I bought at the same time, so in comparison this isn't as good. Why? It seems shorter and the visuals are a bit more disturbing and weird. To put this on after floating around the MBM DVD videoscapes was jarring. A friend asked me to skip several videos as it was freaking her out. (Of course, if that sounds good to you, then I recommend it!)"
1,Terrible waste of time,"I've never reviewed a book here before, but this one was so terrible I just had to warn people. It's repetitive, poorly written, and offers no insights into the motivation of the killer.The structure is circular, the pacing is lousy; it's just a waste of the reader's time"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"I have read many hundreds of true crime books and obviously enjoy the genre. Until I read this book, I had thought that worst one I'd read was the execrable ""The Jeffrey Dahmer Story"" by Donald Davis, which seemed to have been written in two days. ""Garden of Graves"" is worse, and is simply one of the worst books of any kind I've ever read and appears to have been written on the author's lunch break. A reasonably intelligent high school freshman would be embarrassed to have written this book. There is no research, but simply random facts(?) that anyone who had read the newspapers would have already known; and there is not even a pretense of competent writing.DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK, but it is so unbelievably bad that if you can find it in a library, you might want to check it out, because no review can truly do it justice. Rated 1 star only because negative numbers are not available."
3,Nice to have this Wilder horn collection,"It's great that this recording was made, giving us all an opportunity to hear wonderful Alec Wilder music. The horn playing is quite fine and technically excellent. The spirit of Alec Wilder is missing - more a tour de force for for Thomas Bacon. Phillip Moll's piano playing is quite inspiring and goes to the soul of the music."
1,Don't bother,"I am upgrading after having this for roughly two years. Frankly, it's a piece of junk. I have to adjust the air intake daily and clean the pre-filter every three days in order for it to even skim. Even when I get it skimming it only skims for maybe 24 hours. Did I mention that the drop down for hanging broke within the first year (big crack that dripped through my wood floors) so I was forced to make it in-sump? I would NOT recommend this skimmer to anyone unless you're merely looking to swirl large bubbles around a cylinder. Drop the dime on a heavy duty skimmer and you won't watch your water quality slowly decline as I did. Also, buy big, as you really can't over-skim."
2,Seems Fragile. Returned because arrived broken,"It arrived broken, which could happen in shipping, but I could tell it was cheap plastic. If I felt like it was robust and was just carelessly shipped then I'd purchase a replacement; however I'm now looking for another model. I felt like after normal use over time, something would break on it. I was unable to test how it performed as a protein skimmer. It might be fine if you hook it up and don't move it or store it unprotected."
3,average skimmer,It's a starter skimmer it works. It need frequent TLC.Make sure you get a air value replace manufacture air valve.
2,"Buy it for the quick laugh, keep it for the paperweight...","Like just about any novelty CD, this one is good for a chuckle. But you might not find yourself wanting to listen to it over and over, much like you wouldn't want to hear the same joke repeated over and over. Kudos to Mr. Nayder for the hard work in compiling all these ""gems,"" and the 3 minute breaks you get on NPR are a welcome, hilarious little diversion. But a whole album's worth is not worth $16"
2,"Annoying, really.","The music on this cd is wonderfully odd and terrible. It's a great collection in that sense. What's not so wonderful is Jim Nayder's own commentary, some of which literally interrupts the tracks. To be fair, I've never listened to his NPR show, and I bought this cd for the music and not for him. But I find his comments unnecessary. People who buy this cd are probably already in on the joke. They don't need to be constantly reminded how funny these songs are by someone who's not so much funny as he is... annoying."
4,cute book,I read tomorrows wizard when I was in 3rd grade and loved it. This book basicaly involves the training of a youg wizard by tomorrows wizard. I found this book very amusing and should be read by the light at heart. Allthough this book isn't exactly a replacement for Harry Potter or the circle of magic it is certinly and wonderful book.
3,Short But Sweet,"I got this because I wanted to get a little Pee Wee Crayton and my other choices were expensive. The BB they give you is good but the whole thing is kind of stingy. They really should have included more material, but what there is is good. It was very cheap so I bought it."
2,An adventure I can do without,"Cathy Maxwell seems to be one of those authors who runs either hot or col. This one falls into the cold territory.Lyssa is spoiled, immature, and annoying. Ian is much too good for her. He's the best part of this novel, and his struggles against the prejudices of his Irish heritage ring true without beating the reader over the head with it (most of the time).Most of Lyssa's adventures result from her selfish immaturity, thus making them senseless and rather annoying for the adult reader. A disappointment."
2,Just couldn't get into it...,"I really enjoy Cathy Maxwell's books, but for some reason just had a difficult time getting into this book. It seems that many other liked it, but I just found the story obvious and a tad boring. Just my opinion though."
4,"Vast improvement from ""The Lady is Tempted.""","I liked this book - very much. The hero was a sexy, rough, fist-fighting Irishman. The heroine was feisty and adorably flawed.I wish for a little more struggle between the hero and heroine before they get together. This was more of an ""Us Against Them"" storyline. It was still a quick, fun read.Definitely recommended."
3,book,good romance novel... typical love story with an adventure to boot...shipped on time. condition was a little dated but over all acceptable
3,amiability spread thin,"After Licitra's tragic demise I had a yearning to hear his voice, which I hadn't done before; so I ordered this CD. The recordings put him on display in the signature roles for the Italian lyric tenor. His instrument is good, but artistic guidance is missing. The singer's affect reminds me of a phrase applied by an English reviewer to some baritone in the role of Luna; the singer does not have the heft required for aggression, so he substitutes amiability. That's Licitra. He spreads amiability to a thinness, then reveals the one role for which he is entirely suited: Pinkerton, the character who seduces and then dumps Butterfly, one of the most weasly personages in the tenor repertory.For this man to have passed away at age 43 is a crying shame. But history is exigent, and I think it will pass him by."
1,Amateurish,"I'm sorry, but how he made it to the professional stage alludes me? His voice is unsupported and weak and lacks any natural tone or quality. His placement is all over the map, his tone is hollow and it sounds like he never had a voice coach. It's not even a good God given instrument that has a dimension of soul.Sorry, this guy is a hack!Good luck to him non the less."
1,"You're kidding, right?","I'm sorry, but those of you swooning over Licitra simply cannot have heard recordings from the true greats. If your idea of the pinnacle of operatic tenors begins and ends with Bocelli, may I introduce you to the likes of Franco Corelli, Mario Del Monaco, Jussi Bjoerling, Luciano Pavarotti (though not my favorite, still heads and shoulders above what's out there now), and Giuseppe DiStefano. These men were at the top of their profession when their profession was filled with talent, unlike today where any hack with more than one useful octave and a decent tone are considered ""star material"". It's a very sad commentary to the level of talent today that this man is considered a star."
1,Verdi is rolling in his grave,"Untrained, flat singing. Crap! Anyone who thinks this man can sing better than Luciano Pavarotti needs hearing aids and needs to go back and listen to tenors starting with Caruso and all the great tenors who came after himAs a voice teacher, conductor and tenor I can tell you that he CAN NOT SING!!!!"
3,It's Alright,"It does what it's suppose but if you have your own pair of headphones you'll have troubles keeping them all the way plugged in due to the case design, but that is th only flaw on an otherwise good product."
3,Pretty Good,"I'm kind of new to the occult genre (due to being relatively skeptical), but I heard a couple of interviews of Peter Levenda and was intrigued so I bought the book. Well researched stuff; presented in a conversational manner, which was entertaining for non-fiction. The facts that can be nailed down are, and cooincidences and synchronicities are identified as such leaving the reader to draw the conclusions. Overall, a fun non-fiction read, with an end note section at the end of each chapter that provides a great resource for future reading in the areas that one liked. I'll be picking up book 2."
4,Chilling Read,"Scariest book I've read in my 23 years. There were actually a couple times I really got spooked out while reading the book. Levenda had done his research well. From Manson, The Kennedys, to our Nazi founded CIA and space programs.""...given that in the course of history many have acted on beliefs in which many others did not believe, we must perforce admit that for each, to a different degree, history has been largely the theater of illusion."" - Umberto Eco"
3,Interesting but convoluted,"The subject material is fascinating, and there is no doubt this man knows his stuff. Reviewers who dismiss it as 'more consipracy nonsense' are either not interested in versions of American history found outside of their sophmore textbooks or disinformation operatives (joke). Either way, why did they bother reading this in the first place?There is precious litte here that draws conclusions, and that - aside from the authors constant habit of wandering off-topic - was my only complaint. Kudos for the brave tackling of an alternate subject matter!"
1,CD sourced from bad master,"This CD sounds like it is not recorded from the master tapes, it sounds like it was recorded from the LP. There is what sounds like LP disk noise and tracking error from a poor condition LP disc. I had the LP for many years and it sounded much better than this release. I had wanted to buy the CD version, but it was not available for a long time. When I saw this item I purchased it after checking the Wounded Bird Records site which states ""All of our releases are properly licensed from the owner of the original masters, in most cases the original record label and sometimes the artists themselves."" I guess this recording was from the original owner of the LP! When I imported it into iTunes it listed the disk as ""LP version"".I have heard back from Wounded Bird Records and they say that all their CDs are recorded from the master tape. This master must have tape rot!"
1,Beware ! ... This Item Is Defective !!!,"YES, If you're into John McLaughlin, this is a must own.But, Beware!, the batch that Amazon is drawing fromare DEFECTIVE !!!!!.The beautiful music is horribly interupted by soundsI cannot describe.This album is from 1981, so look for it on vinyl."
3,doggie chewables,"This product was shipped in great condition, and on time. The problem being I thought I was buying the small wafers. I am going to have to return these as my small dog will not eat them as she thinks it's medicine. I guess they don't make the small bone looking wafers anymore."
4,Hmmm...,"If this is the lamp that I think it is, and it sure looks like it, it's a very very nice lamp (and sells for about 7 bucks at a store I won't name but everyone knows, that has 4 letters in the name and is Swedish)."
5,Great guitar.,"I haven't picked up a guitar in 15 years. My want to learn came back with a vengence so I bought this one. It had the look I wanted and it sounds great. Sure who would'nt want a nicer more expencive Takamine that will cost you $400 or more. But I can tell you that this one has sound that's just as good (just doesn't have some of the extra's that you probably won't ever use) and I bought mine for $140. In my mind if you just learning, playing for friends and family around the campfire, garage, or in a band this is the perfect guitar for you."
3,great--almost...,"The guitar was nice--a good value--but it was so disappointing to have to send it back because of damage in shipment. It was packaged for shipment very poorly, with very little protection."
1,Worse Than Expected...,"when i bought this guitar i wasn't expecting much, due to the price, but it was way worse than i expected. It showed up and as soon as i pulled it out of the box, i could see that every string was rusty. i tried it out anyway. when i strum every single string buzzed. i figured it just needed tunning to tighten the strigns. that was not the case. every string buzzed at the top. its just not worth buying. you have to work too much to get it right"
1,Terrible,"this is my first written review, I must say something. I have bought many things online.this is the worst purchase i ever made from zzounds. this guitar arrived broken at the top of the fret board. and the strings all buzz terribly on the top of the fret board. i bought it for a friend and i apologised for the embarassment . i unfortunately have to keep it home now.WOW!!!"
1,NOT Satisfied,I ordered BLICQ (9780130145994)GUIDELINES FOR REPORT WRITING 4th EDITIONbut I was mailed a 3rd edition copy of the book. I'm not happy. I am not satisfied with their service.
2,"Gorgeous, but...","This set is beautiful when it first arrives, but the finish on the silver wears off so quickly! Not even professional cleaning could get the shine back. One of the stones has fallen out of the wedding band, and I had only worn it twice. I really wanted this to last, because the rings are so pretty! It's just too bad it didn't work out. :("
5,wonderful book on early furniture . . .,if you have an interest in the development of early furniture . . . and how to recognize real pieces that are still on the market . . .and still surprisingly available . . .this is perhaps the definitive book out there . . . it is highly recommended despite how costly it is . . .
4,Oak Furniture Chinnery,"This title was pretty darn expensive, so I expected a lot. I am still debating whether I got my money's worth. Granted, if you are interested in oak furniture, your avenues of chasing down study material are somewhat limited and the info is usually produced in limited print runs. So basically you really DO have to get this book...and its companion, Early British Chairs & Seats:&#8203; From 1500-1700, Tobias Jellinek. (also expensive). Man, it's tough being me."
2,Why no Maps or Illustrations?,"Reprinted books are of little or NO USE to academics without the full complement of maps and illustrations. Maps and Illustrations are integral parts of a monograph's contents. Thus these reprints are not at all helpful as much very important information is simply not given to us. The question then begs itself to the reprint producers, ""WHY BOTHER""!"
5,the cymbals are...,i am a amuter drummer.I love to drum but my Fender Starcaster cymals were holding me back.When this cymbal came in the mail and i struck it for the first time it was the most clean and crisp sounding cymbal ive herd in a long time.I was amazed because you can make the cymbal sound like a ride cymbal.I recomend this cymbal for upgrading drummer looking for a great cymbal at a great price.
1,Horrible,This thing broke within 3 weeks. I play metalcore and it couldn't keep up. Go with Sabian instead. They are way more durable then these things.
3,Good for price,"I enjoyed this while I had it but unfortunately it ended up cracking pretty quickly (whether that was due to quality or my own style of playing, I don't know). I would buy again if looking for splashes in this price range."
1,the worst game,this game is the worst game game in the whole world.after playing for 15 minutes i got bored.don't let the pictures fool you.it's only one player so thats boring.and all the missions look the same
5,QUESTION???,"I have a question for all of you guys who play xbox and other stations..I am told I am getting an x-box for Christmas..and looking forward to it..but does anybody know if a Chess game will ever be put out? With various characters, like they were playing in starwars etc? Then nobody has to worry about the game aspect per se.. because chess is one of the all time great ""games"" anyway.."
4,This is a pretty good game,"This game is ok. The graphics are great and there are over 70 planes and more than 50 missions. Most of the missions are pretty challenging and fun but there is a time limit. I think this kinda takes the fun away from the game. Most of the smaller missions keep repeating themselves over and over. And when you crash you can't see yourself crash. Just a black screen that says ""mission failed"" or something like that. But besides all of that this is a good game, just not perfect."
3,"Good graphics, horrible interface","Great graphics, yet: not tutorial, no lessons, no practice, The mainmenu is weak...the list goes on. You should get to practice with any plane, get to choose from a couple missions to start from etc.3/5 bc graphics are good, and fun to play, but still a let down"
4,WHAT NO 2ND PLAYER its ok its still a great game,"Me and my friend have been trying to get a good air game. when starfox came out for N64 we thought we hade found it. and we did untill i got Air Force Delta Storm. everything about this game is great! the fack that you have to buy new planes makes you keep playing to see what the next one will be. and they have realy plans like the F16 and the F22 they also have different countrys plans and plans that were never used in war. one thing they could have done different was a better story!!! and whats with the date being ""2000 and something"". for people like me and my friend this is the game we were looking for (to bad no 2 player)p.s please dont mind my spelling theres no spell check and i failed English"
2,frustration storm,"This was my first ever experience with video games and I found the instructions very vague. They assume you've played before and are familiar. I guess most are though, but for me and my family we were frustrated. You have to fly the same mission over and over before you can move on. I thought I'd have my pick of planes and missions but no. Saying 70 planes or whatever is very misleading. Once you finally win, there are no instructions how to ""save"" so you don't have to start from square one again. Turn it off and boom..back to sqaure one. Other complaints that escape me now. But graphics incredible and I hope to meet someone who can explain what the instructions don't."
1,"Looked good, but it failed miserably","Ugh. That's all I have to say. I have been awaiting this game with as much anticipation as the amazing totally recommended halo, but when i finally started to play it, ugh. The graphics looked great on the back of the case, and in many magazines, but in the game, they are just plain boring! Ships look like snapshots moving along the water, and there isn't anything cool that happens when you crash! They went out of their way to make this game's intercace hard to play, and i couldn't even figure out how to start a mission! The planes are just tubes with wings, and this title is not even worth a buck to me!"
4,AIR FORCE DELTA STORM,"this is a fun game for all who love fighter games. this is the most realistic fighter game i've ever played, the mountain range, the cloud, and everything around it looks so real. great buy for anyone who enjoy the movie ""top gun"" or just wants to feel like a hero!!!"
3,"If you fly for real, keep your reciept!","Yes it's fun and awesome to look at. But if you are looking to put a jet into a 90 degree bank and crank back on the stick...this is not a simulator! I was a little disappointed that it was slightly incorrect aerodynamically. You won't be doing any rolls, barrrel or otherwise. Also, I thought the inference of the Briefer to always refer to the enemy as the ""United Forces"" somewhat interesting considering the main platform of design for this product appears to be made in Japan. Hmmm...could this be a subliminal message!? It is a lot of fun, it's just doesn't fly like an airplane should."
2,Not worth the money,"This game is worth a rental and a weekend of fun...thats about it. The graphics look sharp and the controls are easy to learn.HOWEVER, I got bored of this game real quick, the voice over acting is terrible. It's not a sim so don't expect realism, (I guess its nice to know that your plane will still fly after its been with with a few sidewinders).Go buy Gotham Racing if your looking for some speed, avoid this thing unless you got $...to blow."
3,Meh...,"Ok, I own this game.... First off, the price! There is no WAY it is worth $76.00 or better! Im sorry. As an avid aviation lover and game enthusiast, I can say that while it lacks something of a realistic plot, it is still a rather entertaining game. However, it is for your original Xbox [which is no where near an antique], it does not have the best graphics [or plot], and it is slightly now outdated. Long in short, I like putsing around with this game, but it is no where near the value being placed here, no way no how."
2,basic but ok,this game was ok to play the graphics are decent but not to impressive. the storyline is pretty basic.
4,"Switch Controls to ""ACE""","I found that if you go to options and change the control configuration from novice to ace, it will give you the ability to do barrel rolls and fly upside down. Very Fun Game in my opinion!"
3,Take it for what it is,"Not the best, not the worst.PROS:-great graphics-choice of complexity in controls makes it easy for anyone to play, and can be challenging with Ace controls-if what you want to do is have some simple fun air combat (singleplayer ONLY) it is funCONS:-no multiplayer-a bit too much repitition, they should have had more variety in the on-the-way-to-your-real-mission situations. There are only five at the most, so you get pretty bored of that terrain and starting situationHave fun!"
2,Weak Ace Combat Wanna Be,This game was such a disappointment! After playing Halo and being stunned by the graphics capabilities of the X-Box I was excited to try out this game. It has fairly weak graphics and the missions are rather boring. True you get to unlock and fly quite a few different planes but what does that matter when the missions are as boring as they are? Stay clear of this game as there are sure to be much better flight sims available soon on the X-Box.
4,More fun than hand grenade...,"An excellent game. It features a huge variety of aircraft to choose from. From the venerable old A-7 thru todays F-22. You get to shoot up all kinds of ground equipment, surface ships and aircraft. If you are flight simulator person, don't bother. This is all about flying around destroying stuff in varying scenarios."
3,amazing graphics but no depth,"Let me start out by saying that the grahics in this game are fan-frikin-tastic. The planes look about as realistic as those in the movie ID4 which were all computer generated. The dog fighting is also very exciting. However, the storyline in this game is almost non-existant. Each board is the same, find a ship (building, bridge, plane) etc. and blow it up. Each mission is pretty much the same and has little to no depth or back story. It reminds me of the old flyiing games on the orignal Nintendo like 1942. The game very soon gets repetitive."
1,Sorry excuse,"If my advice redirects just one person's ($$$) to a more deserving software company, it will have been worth my time. Don't walk; RUN away from this title. It's pathetic and (I'm serious) ATARI-like. Shame on you, Konami. I spit on Air Force Delta Storm. My view may be a bit shaded after playing Ace Combat 4 (A truly excellent game), but trust me, you can do a whole lot better. If you really need a flight sim and don't have a PS2, wait for Namco or MS to bring decency to the XBOX in this genre."
4,aIR FORCE,This game is getting amazing reviews. If you like flight sims try this is will be a great title for Xbox. I toatally recomend this Game because all the game websites are giving it great reviews
4,"Simple, dumb, and (mostly) works","This Item does just what it's supposed to, automatically adjust voltage for fans based on temperatures. You can not change the temps at which a certain voltage is supplied. But you should already know that, if you researched it correctly. It is simple and just works, no problems so far, no weird settings and stuff it just works.Prossimpledoes what it's supposed toset alarm temps and save them (if battery works)Conscan't change tempsCan't save the time with mine (battery might be dead)and also can't save alarm tempstemp probes are to thick, in my opinion, to be situated between a heat spreader and a heat sink, so on heat sink is required, but it seems to work just fine (lower temps than actual but it's still ok for fan control)For all the cons it is still a good product especially if you can get it cheap (i got it for 10$ from amazon, new)"
5,belisema!,"I really do enjoy this soundtrack very much. As always, the CD is great because the movie is great. When watching the movie I could never just listen to the music or the dialogue because both are excellent. The CD is a little short (about 42 minutes), but I really don't think that takes anything away from the great music that Nicola Piovani composed. I am very pleased with my purchase of this wonderful CD."
5,Excellent book,"It is an excellent book. I wished I read it years ago. The examples on this book are phenomenon. This book is not only helping me to make great decisions on business setting, it really helps me on personal life. Great book... informative and insightful."
4,Making Great Decisions,"This book is written in a casual style that even non-business types can understand. Many of the principles he describes are of benefit to a wide variety of readers. I thought so highly of mine, I purchased one for my grandson who is just entering the employment scene."
3,Interesting recording.,"I bought this CD more for the content than the singers. Interesting and varied repertoire, some that I already knew but quite alot that I'd been wanting to hear for quite some time. The voices are barely adequate, the accompanist excellent. It was worth the price because there are no other recordings around."
5,slo-core at its best,"As an longtime unabashed Low fan I am reticent about making comparisons, but so be it. I have two solid albums to base this on (this is the follow-up to an equally beautiful debut, s/t). The male/female harmonies and slow deliberate instrumentation are reminiscent of Low--but not derivative or cheap copy. There's also a lush, dreamy flange guitar thing going on in some of the songs that is reminiscent of Robin Guthrie (Cocteau Twins). I am picky and quite willing to toss aside mediocre discs. This one has been a treasure and regular in the time I've owned it. Clearly I am not a professional reviewer or musician, but I sincerely hope this helps."
1,Don't bother with it.,Does not fit OEm brackets such as alternator and power steering. It's been frustrating trying to make it work. I compared it to my original ford pump and the holes don't line up. Made in China garbage.
3,Condition Not As Stated,"Ordered this book based on the advertised ""Like New"" condition. Was ""good"" at best."
4,good book,"though there are some written words on the book, it still can see clearly, a good book. but it takes me to long time to wait this book."
1,Read the Fine Print,"Read the fine print when purchasing a used book. If this is a book with questing and answer sections some writing may mean the entire book except maybe one or two pages are already filled in. Not a problem if you want someone elses opinion, but definitely a problem if those section are being used by the professor to test your knowledge of the topic."
1,Not impressed,"My roommate borrowed this CD from a friend and we both just had a chance to listen to it. I must say that I was 100% under whelmed. The music seems very amateurish and unoriginal. We did not finish the CD but from what we heard, it was a flop. In addition, it seemed to me that the recording quality was substandard. In my opinion, save your money with this one."
2,Heard some clips on your myspace page,"No offense, but I don't think you are ready for wide release yet. You need to up your practice sessions and get some assistance with lyrics."
1,Classic example of ineptitude,"There is not one track on this album that could raise this band to the ranks of one-hit-wonder status. No catchy hooks. no contagious lyrics. Nothing on this ablum can be classified as extraordinary. This album places this band in the precarious position of pursuing a place for themselves among contemporary popular artists. It is positively a novice attempt. This album will affirm Violet Nine's position among the many dull, uninspired, mediocre bands that quietly fade away before anyone outside of their local existence even hears their name.To achieve success, an up and coming band must create music that is original, exciting and progressive. None of those qualities can be found on Any Wonder. Judging by this album, Violet Nine would have fallen through the cracks of mediocrity two decades ago.There is nothing on Any Wonder that is electrifying or astonishing enough to compete with popular bands on the mainstream airways."
1,People got mad and left when they played this CD,"I was at a party last Friday. Everyone was laughing and having a good time and then someone put this CD on. Everybody got upset and some people started leaving.I don't know what crowds the other reviewers hang out with, but there were about 150 people at the party and not one of them liked this CD. Personally, I didn't care for it much either.The host took it out of the CD player and smashed it to make everyone happy again. I guess that makes one less bad CD for someone else to have to listen to."
5,We love our Britax!,"While installation was a pain in our Honda CR-V, we couldn't be happier with our Marathon. Our son is 90th percentile in height at fifteen months and still fits comfortably rear-facing."
5,Top notch,"This is our first baby and simply love the Marathon. It is big and a little heavy, but quality is top notch. Would not carry my little girl in anything else."
2,2009 model strap is thinner than previous years,"This is my second Britax and I am a bit disappointed. The best part that I liked about Britax was solid thick strap. My other Britax was 2004 Onyx and it is still going strong. The strap does not show signs of aging unlike Graco's or Evenflo's that are often loosening after some use.For 2nd kid, I bought this expecting same quality. However, it lets me down on the strap. The STRAP is THINNER than previous year models of Marathon. Is it designed to last only for 5 years due to the carseat expiration fiasco!I feel my child is less secure with this model. I hope that the company seriously reconsiders to go back to original strap."
2,Harness is too hard to tighten,"I REALLY wanted to like this car seat. I hear such good things about Britax and the reviews seem to be great. Unfortunately, I found the harness really hard to tighten. I would pull as hard as I could and it was still really loose. I'm comparing it to a Chicco Keyfit infant sit, which has a super smooth harness. I made sure the harness wasn't twisted up somehow and adjusted the shoulder height, but it was still too tight. I felt like I was fighting it every day, so I had to return it.I ended up trying out other car seats at a local store and I eventually bought the Britax Diplomat. The harness is still tighter than I'd like, but it's better and I prefer the push button release. It's also smaller than the Marathon, so it fits better in my midsize car."
5,Safe and Secure,"We shopped very carefully for a carseat for our son, and once he outgrew the infant seat (Graco SnugRide), we looked to Baby 411's gear guide to see what rated best. This carseat was the winner.My son is a tad small for his age, but he rides like the king of the backseat when he's in his carseat. This carseat is washable, I can say that for sure! Our son is 3 and eats snacks frequently in it, and we just wipe it down with a baby wipe. Bigger spills can be taken care of by removing the straps and cover, which is easy to do. It's well-padded, cushy, and I feel that the ""wings"" around the head-area keep my kiddo safer.The only problem we've had is, it's BIG. We drive a BMW 325i and now that his legs are getting longer, my son is getting a little cramped. With my husband's seat pushed back (when husband drives) it's a tight fit.Shop around for the best deals on this seat: don't wait until you MUST have one, and you'll have time to sort through the different prices."
4,Good Carseat,"We have just started using this carseat with our 4-month old daughter. She is very comfortable in it and seems to like it a lot more that her infant carseat. We love the color, and it was very easy to install. It doesn't take up any more room in our small Nissan Sentra than her infant carrier did. The only reason that I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the buckles don't always click when you snap them in, and it makes me feel uneasy. Especially because the instruction booklet says to listen for the click."
5,It is a very good car seat,It is a very nice car seat. My nine months daughter had a short sleep when she sat on it. It is very comfortable and safe.
5,GREAT!!!,I purchased this seat for my son one month before his first birthday. I wish that I had purchased it sooner. It was clear that his carrier seat was too small because his feet were hanging over. Now he has plenty of room and he actually looks comfortable. He seems so relaxed and enjoys facing forward.
4,Bad Instructions!,"Horrible instructions, I almost gave up and wanted to return this half way through the installation. But once installed, it feels stable and my kid is comfortable in it."
5,Worth the cost,We call this the Lexus of carseats. My 7 month old is extremely comfortable in here and it looks really nice too. I like how easy it is to snap him into it.
3,Not for short mothers,"My mother-in-law bought this for me, but with it in the middle position in the back seat of my SUV I could not see over it out the back window. It is very plush and looks super comfy but I had to return it. I am 5' 2"". I got the Britax Roundabout instead and I LOVE IT!! if you're short consider how tall the Marathon is and maybe go for the roundabout."
2,BUYER BEWARE- NOT A SEAT FOR INFANTS,"While this seat is wonderful for older babies and toddlers it is not right for an infant.I bought this with the intention of only using one seat from birth until she needed a booster. I was furious and disappointed when I went to leave the hospital and my dd, 7lbs6oz 20in, was way too small for this seat. The straps were a good 2in above her shoulders and rubber on the straps was longer than her body. It was impossible for me to fit my child in this seat and even if I could it would have been incredibly unsafe.I feel deceived by Britax. I am now out the extra money I never intended to spend on a bucket seat. I also am very concerned about the infants that are improperly buckled and lives are in danger because of the misrepresentation of this seat from Britax."
3,"I love it , but it sits so high in our Suv and our son at 37 inches is almost too tall for it already","I do love this car seat. The only downsides so far is that it sits really high in our SUV. And it says that it is for kids 49 inches and below. Well, my son is only 37 inches tall and he only has about 4-5 inches to the top of this seat."
4,The toddler's don't complain!,"The best review I can give these Marathon seats is that my toddlers never complain when riding in them. Both the boy and girl enjoy their seat and have sat in them for many drives, long and short. I love the fact that I can easily move the seats around using the easy latch release (just press the button!) and I can also install the seats using seat belts when the latch system isn't available. If I had to pick a negative I would have to argue that the seats are very bulky. You cannot put three on a row of seats, you can barely fit two Marathons and a skinny person on a row in a Honda Odyssey. But this also means your kiddos have room to kinda spread out and I would have to think that the bulk helps during an impact which I hope I will never have to test."
5,Excellent Seat for the Money,"I never take the time to write a review for the products I purchase - just not time it seems, but this car seat is well worth it. From what I understand, the Britax models all have higher crash standard than the Graco's, Evenflos, etc. Yes, it is pricey, but even me being a penny pincher felt I got every bit of my money's worth. Easy to assemble, easy to install, easy to wash...Plus, I was able to find a dicontinued style (just the maternial was no longer being manufactored in that design) on the internet and that helped with the cost. High recommended."
5,My son is very comfortable.,This car seat is perfect for my son. He is much happier in it than he was in the infant car seat. It works great so far.
5,comfy and safe,This is our second Marathon for our second child and they love them. It passes the road trip test for comfort and very safe. We were rear ended on a freeway at night and the kids never even woke up from their sleep. They are the best in my book.
4,"onyx colour bleaches out, but great seat","We totally love our Marathons, but we have an Onyx coloured one, and the black sides bleached out in the sun within the first year, so it's less attractive, but I don't really care that much."
5,Rear-facing fits fine in a Corolla,"Great carseat, easy to install, our 11-month old is happy and comfy in it. It fits fine rear-facing fully-reclined in the center back seat of our 94' Corolla."
4,Cowmooflage Britax Carseat,"Like all carseats, a bit cumbersome and bulky. This one is a bit large for a smaller car...it doesn't leave a whole lot of room for more than one more person in the backseat. We liked the asethetic aspects of the product + you can get your favorite team logo as a replacement after-market cover - Go Huskers!"
