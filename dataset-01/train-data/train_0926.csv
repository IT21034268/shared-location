5,Do Not Fear the Title,"Sure, I went to the theater for the lurid scenario, but I was caught off guard by the strangely sweet story and the palpable passion of the characters.If you think that this is one of ""those movies,"" you're only half right, and maybe less than half. This movie is a surprise. If you are apprehensive of the title, all I can say is ""Get over it."" You don't want to miss this film."
3,watch the WHOLE movie...,"Don't be fooled by the Russ Meyer sexploitation feel to the cover and the marketing...It ain't about that ....this is a great movie about 2 people with 2 different issues, and how they work it out....together....with her in chains...Great Blues music....Don't be fooled by the first 30 minutes (lots of trailer trash feel). This is a good movie...regardless of how it did in the theatres..."
1,Nasty movie do not buy,do not waste your money. i like Samuel Jackson but hated this movie. Save your money and buy something else
2,black snake moan? more like wack crap groan!,"this movie was horrible. i'm talking absolute dog crap awful. i wish i would have just stopped watching when i realized it was really but kept going just to finish it.more about style than substance. poorly executed. the story could be okay, but the acting, directing, editing were all crap. such horrible acting by justin timberlake; haha!christina ricci was smokin hot though. distractingly so. i think the producers realized this would be the only redeeming quality early on, and they featured it quite heavily.also, samuel l. jackson is always a cool mothersucker; so that was good. and the music is pretty good throughout."
2,"Facile, stupid and intriguing in small parts","Other reviews have written about the plot which is pure gumball and at the end of the film you wonder why did you bothered. It lacks credibility however in parts there are bits that get you in and the acting in some segments is enough to hold you in your seat.Overall its 20% bleeding heart plot, 60% facile and that leaves 20% where the actors actually do a good job despite the direction and context of the whole plot, and the biggest surprise for me was Justin Timberlake. Why he took a role in this movie I don't know but for what it had to be I thought that he did a good job."
2,"Odd film, bad points outweigh the good.","I rented this one thinking it was a ""blues"" flick. It was, in a way...I liked the soundtrack a lot, some pretty sweet blues. The acting (even Justin TimberFlake!) was decent (esp. Ricci, Jackson, the guy who played the preacher, and the lady from ""Law and Order""), and it was a hoot seeing Jackson perform a really nasty, dirty version of ""Stagolee"", but these pluses were far outweighed by things like a fairly incomprehensible story, graphic depictions of Ricci engaging in what I think amounts to bestiality, pretty crappy dialog and sloppy direction. I suppose it's worth viewing once, especially if you dig blues music, but I wouldn't recommend going out and buying this one ""sight unseen""."
3,Blues,"Better than you expect. For a while the watcher is wondering just where this one is going. Jackson commands the screen and Ricci burns it up. The whole premises suggests something nasty, but it turns out to be a feel good movie. You can actually have a good time."
4,A twist compared to the trailer,"Not what I expected when I watched Black Snake Moan. I had heard the title before because I am a fan of blues music and heard Blind Lemon Jefferson's version many years ago. It does have blues music in it and it plays a part in the storyline. When you hear about a young white girl being chained up in a older black guy's house, you probably think something along the lines of kidnapping or forced sexual relations. It's interesting how the characters develop in this movie and how the interaction between the two main characters leads to the conclusion. Highly recommended."
3,Theatergoer's Moan,"Contrived plot. Very unrealistic handling of psychological elements of the story -- Rae didn't ""get"" nymphomania because she was abused by Mom's boyfriend, nor was the behavior portrayed consistent with nymphomania. And she sure didn't get cured by being chained up, released, and talked to by an understanding blues player. Nonetheless enjoyable performances by the major actors. And who doesn't like tales of redemption?"
4,Worth seeing again,"I saw this film on Cinemax last night and I think I need to see it again. What started as a taut, emotional, sexual rollercoaster ended up losing steam midway through and wrapped up too neatly for me.Some incredible themes were explored in this film, mainly the exorcising of people's personal demons.I absolutely loved the relationship between Rae and Laz, brilliantly portrayed by Christina Ricci and Samuel L. Jackson. Really, I think it's some of the best work either actor has ever done and the film is worth watching just for that!And Justin Timberlake was surprisingly moving in his role. Very impressive!And the blues! Oh! The blues! AWESOME MUSIC! I loved getting a taste of that culture.But again, there was this weird drop in pacing about 2/3 of the way through and I really wonder what got lost on the cutting room floor. I'll have to give it another view to see what I might've missed."
4,Aggressive and Perverse,"Aggressive and perverse, this film is a curve ball thrown with some serious attitude. From Ricci flicking-off a tractor in the opening sequence to Jackson chaining her to a radiator, it's hard to imagine this project being pitched (let alone green-lit); yet, Brewer somehow manages to elevate this unique story's violent and sexual subject matter through ingenius casting (with the exception of Timberlake) and the incorporation of a blues subtext. If it weren't for the compromises that it tragically makes in it's second act, this film would certainly be receiving much more attention. (7/10)"
1,Just a bad movie!,This was a bad movie in my opion can't agree withthe other reviews the plot was stupid please don'twaste you're time i had to force myself to get through it!
1,terrible,girl running around almost naked the whole time. these actors should be ashamed for making this picture..and that justin timberlake is a joke.
1,stupid and just plain unnecessary,"An incredibly stupid and unnecessary, as well as surprisingly dull, exploitation flick about a troubled white gal and the black blues guitarist who tries to save her from herself. Samuel L. Jackson and Christina Ricci wasted themselves in this. Were they hard up for money or what? Only worth watching for Justin Timberlake."
3,"Excellent Storyline, Poorly Executed","Black Snake Moan is the story of 2 unlikely individuals who cross paths and strangely heal each other. I was expecting a very Quentin Tarrentinoish flavor to this movie considering the DVD artwork, use of similar imagery and storyline but this movie was not executed as well as it could have been. The movie drags on and is about 1/2 hour too long. The acting is good but certain scenes are just dragged on for too long such as some of the guitar scenes. Overall, I do suggest you check this movie out but its not one of my favorites."
4,Strange but good,"It's a very odd movie but not in a bad way it would be good on it's own but what really make's this movie is the sound track. Gritty delta blues at it's best. I understand Samuel L Jackson learned the guitar for this part, He learned it very well."
4,Very unique Film,"I really liked this movie. Its a very different movie. Unpredicatable, very good. \99% better than stuff put out by hollywood today."
4,"Hot, Sticky, Slimy, Gooey","""Black Snake Moan"" is a sticky, gooey, sizzlingly hot erotic mess that doesn't make a lot of sense, but its raw sexuality is so rare in movies that it's damned welcome. This is a movie that brings new meaning to the expression ""Chain her to the kitchen"".Samuel L. Jackson has to fight the temptation to guzzle demon whiskey and play even more demonic slide guitar, Christina Ricci has to fight the temptation to bang anything in pants and Justin Timberlake has to fight the temptation to act badly.I enjoyed the silly Jim Thompson-styled pulpy vibe of the film and loved the dirty electric slide guitar playing in the bar scene. Jackson isn't a bad blues singer, not bad, he's alright. I thought this was one of the best films with blues taking center stage. Excellent!"
2,Mind-bogglingly RIDICULOUS!,"Well, I love both of the lead actors, and quite enjoyed having the camera walk over Christina Ricci's luscious half-naked body throughout, and the sex scenes she did were pretty hot. But as a whole, this film just kept getting more and more ridiculous and implausible as it goes along.I'm a huge blues fan myself, always have been. But this film feels like an outrageous parody of the blues and the culture it comes from. About the first 1/3 of the film was somewhat palatable, then it just kept getting worse and worse, with some of the cheesiest dialogue and situations I've seen in a long time. All the more painful because there's zero irony anywhere to be found. The script and director seem to come from some kind of adolescent romanticism blended with hokey New Age therapy. Even Samuel L. Jackson's considerable talents as an actor can't save this one.The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars instead of 1 is Christina Ricci's hotness..."
3,Chain reaction,"Brewer's Southern sizzler is a rather tawdry and implausible study of redemption made interesting by good performances, a steamy atmosphere, and a rousing soundtrack. As a morality tale BLACK SNAKE MOAN is certainly a mixed bag. It revels from start to finish in its political incorrectness, and it's easy to see why some are offended by this film. It's also too self-reverential and would benefit from a sense of irony: the few moments of humour are all unintentional. And yet, despite these flaws, this film provides compelling viewing and is a prime example of a guilty pleasure. Also worth noting is Christina Ricci's wide-eyed sex-appeal, which is extraordinary. Boy is she smoking'!"
2,Good Acting; Boring film,"I found Black Snake Moan to be raunchy and boring. The plot never developed like I thought it would and the ending kinda left me hanging. Great acting by the cast but the story had no point, I got tired of Ricci running around in those dirty white underwear, and the whole chaining her up thing was dumb and pointless. Sorry but this one is not worth the money."
5,Hot Video,"A very hot, steamy video. Very good acting and a hot, humid atmosphere. Well worth watching. A keeper. The music is great, and Ricci and Jackson do a great acting job."
3,Worth viewing,"I enjoyed the movie. It was a little different but good. Some reviewers say the ""black snake"" reference was sexual......maybe but if you actually watch the movie Laz is playing the guitar and refers to what he calls ""the black snake moan"". It shines light on a taboo subject, sexual abuse. It gives insight on why a lot of ""loose"" women behave as they do. If nothing else I'm sure it provokes thought about that. It does require you to think while watching the movie so if you like simple movies it's not for you. Some parts are stereotypical but the story overall is good....Worth checking out."
5,Book,"I have yet to finish this but I was very please with the book, CD and workbook. I am looking forward to going through it. Thank you for the prompt service."
3,Paradox,"I just pulled the compressor out of the box and was mightly impressed. The ""fit & finish"" was first rate. After going through the pre-check I cranked it up. It filled the tank quickly and quietly. At this point I was ready to give it the Five Star rating. However.... the regulator refused to work. One would have thought that this would have been tested prior to shipment, but evidently not. Other than this faulty piece, I am quiet satisfied. Hopefully a trip to the service center will remedy the problem."
5,"superb, and not easy to miss","We're breaking for snow- weather, not machinery failure. What more can I say? The new machine runs and runs, regardless of temperature, rain or shine. It's bright yellow. Which is all you'll notice, which is great! I'd give it 6 stars if it had a flush mounted or built-in water separator/tool oiler. But then they'd never sell any more tools...And, with power tool cords, compressor hoses, ladders, saw horses, joists and rafters, not to mention canine helpers, we Never foul anything on this smooth, flush mounted unit (dogs avoid it, too). I like the sound, the color, the design, the power and the consistency. You will too. Gotta go- stopped snowing..."
5,Very Nice Unit,"I had a Porter Cable pancake compressor and yes it did roll around in the back of my truck and had a real hard time maintaining pressure when under extreme load such as running my texture gun. I replaced the Porter Cable with the Dewalt and what a difference. Very stable during transport, looks real nice and several customers have commented on it. Best of all it seems to have lots of power and recharges very quickly. I can run my texture gun and it keeps up just fine. I mostly use it for my nail guns and I like the fact that it has two hose connections. It is a fairly hefty unit but it does carry nice due to it's shape."
5,Other tools,"A lot of folks are rating this unit against nail guns. However, I use it primarily with other air tools including an impact wrench. I was a little worried about the 4 gallon reserve tank handling my impact wrench air volume which is the most common tool I use for odd jobs. But I can say it stands up very well to heavy use with other tools.If you're looking for a product that can do it all, I would recommend this unit."
2,made in mexico,"the quality of this air compressor will only go downhill. when EMGLO in johnstown, pa. sold the factory to DEWALT, they were building a high quality unit. it didn't take them long to ship this work to mexico."
1,Major quality control and service issues,"I am a contractor and have had this compressor for three years. This is the worst compressor I have ever owned. I have had too many problems with this machine. The main problem is that the unit will not start up at the beginning of the day. It starts very slowly and pops the breaker about a dozen times before the motor reaches full speed (rpm), then it runs fine until it cools down and the problem starts again. I have had the regulator, cold start valve and check valve assembly replaced, but nothing has had any effect. I should have just replaced the compressor for the headache it's been. I've called Dewalt to try to find out the problem and they seem to be totally clueless. This just doesn't seem to be designed for continious use. If you want a professional quality machine try the Thomas T-2820."
1,Damaged poorly packaged,"After looking a long time for a compressor to do trim work on my home, I decided to purchase the D55155 compressor. The first unit I recieved was damaged in transit, so I got a replacement. The second unit arrived with the motor frozed up. Needless to say that I was not pleased with the wasted time and energy. Amazon decided that they would not send me the third unit, to my surprise. Beware that when you buy this compressor you may have issue with the compressor being damaged or defective due to poorly / cardboard packaging inside the shipping box."
1,Disappointing,"I too have had the problem of the compressor not starting, tripping breakers, etc. This compressor has trouble starting and it has been getting progressively worse.Dewalt service center sold me an ""upgraded"" on-board breaker. Didn't help at all. Dewalt service center was no help whatsoever.I've looked at the high price of replacement parts to start swapping things out. But I don't think it's worth it. That money will be better spent on a different brand replacement compressor.This is my only bad experience with a Dewalt branded product. But it's been so frustrating that I think they have lost me as a customer."
3,DeWalt D 55155,"I use my compressor for light work on my auto and boat. It runs my air tools very well. The compresser came with a defective copper air line, DeWalt shipped a new one and I installed it. After a year or so of use the pressure switch started to leak. I repaired the switch by properly tightening the screw around the gasket.I use DeWalt and Makita tools; Makita products are better."
4,Versatile compressor for serious hobbysts,"I've had this compressor for nearly two years and have been very happy with it. I've used it for many home-improvement projects and also was happy to have it when working on my classic car. It has performed well and I love the fact that it has two universal hose takeoffs. The only time that it underperformed was when I tried to run an automotive dual-action air sander off of it, it just needed too many CFMs and the compressor couldn't keep up. But it has no problem keeping up with nail guns and other construction related air tools..."
3,Great Light Duty/Home/Hobby use Compressor,"I've had this compressor for about 4 years now, and would say it is a good choice for a light duty home or hobby use compressor. I haven't had any problems with it (such as the regulator, reported by others), but I didn't try and use this as my main job site compressor. It can keep up with a framing nailer or even a couple of small brad nailers, but it won't keep up with a spray gun, grinders, or sanders. It is portable, but I wouldn't want to have to rely on this for a job site compressor unless I was doing trim/finish only. For light duty use, if you do the oil changes and drain the tank periodically this compressor should last you for many years. If you need to move it a lot, there are lighter better choices. If you have to run spay guns, grinders, sanders or other large air pneumatic tools look elsewhere. If you just run some small pneumatic tools around the house and want a long lasting compressor this would be good, but there are cheaper choices."
5,The night is shattered and the blue stars shiver in the distance,"This collection, in my opinion, is the best book of Neruda's poems for readers in English. It contains the majority of his best poems, and it has a few translators (but not too many, four altogether) so we can say how different peoples interpretations read differently. That being said, these are some of the best translators of Neruda, and it has a great introduction by Alastair Reid.In addition to what it contains, the book itself is well made, a very good size and feel to it.This is one of those books I carry around with me all the time. In my opinion, Neruda is the best poet to ever live, he's addicting to read and truly a voice of the people, and this is the best volume of his work."
2,Rehash of VH-1 Legends,"Having purchased this CD without a description available, I bought the proverbial ""pig in a poke"". And a disappointing purchase it was. Hoping to hear previously unreleased recordings from the mighty Zep, I was let down by an audio documentary which has an all-too-familiar resemblance to VH-1's ""Legends"" expose on the band. No new information and none of the video. I'm not sure to what the other reviewer's of this CD are referring, but I recommend saving your money and keeping your eyes peeled for the replay on VH-1."
1,broke in 6 months,this fridge was great for my son and then it stopped working in 6 months what a dissapoitment!!
1,False advertising,"The product description says the fridge can cool 40 degrees below ambient room temperature. The packaging on the product, which I received today, says 20 degrees below room temperature. I am very frustrated, and of course there is no information in the package that lets me know how to return the product, etc."
1,works but too small,"Just as advertised, this is a mini refrigerator, it works well, but is too small to be practical unless you want to use it in an auto. It only holds 4 can sodas. I received it as a gift. Spend $25 more and get an dorm size mini fridge."
2,"Repetitive, Short, and unimaginitive.","I'm not sure why people were willing to pay for a CD with 4 songs on it (20 minutes). It was clearly an oversight on my part.I was looking for some more Big Beat (i've been listening to a lot of it lately, say, Propellerheads, Leftfield, Lunatic Calm, Hexstatic, and Apollo440), and Amazon's editors said that this was a good choice.Well, I'm sorry to inform you, people with a good amount of listening experience will write this off as repetitive cookie-cutter ""electronica."" It has no soul, no beat, does not move me (nor will it move you).I'm frankly baffled that people have given this record 5 stars."
3,Good to a point,I did like this book and it gives a lot of good ideas for writing romance and I believe if V.C. Andrews lived long enough she might have become a good romance writer. But on the whole I highly doubt if I was going to write romance I would start with using an idea another author came up with. As a writer I would find it extremely hard to write that way. For some it might work to get the creative juices flowing but as a way to write I don't see it happening.
2,Wrong purchase,"I didn't realise what I was ordering, I just saw the name V.C. Andrews and thought it was one of her books, my fault for not reading the whole description content."
1,Worst quality ever!,This phone charger didn't even charge my phone and when I took the charger out of the wall the prongs broke off into the outlet!
4,Laptop surge suppressor,"I travel to Asia every year. Last year a surge in the local 220v supply killed my laptop AC adapter-charger. Luckily the laptop survived. The APC 100-240v surge protector is compact and easy to carry. I have not tried it in Asia but with APC's name, I would trust it. The only problem is that this suppressor does not fit all Dell laptops. This one fits my Dell XPS 1330 but not my Inspiron M500 simply because in the former the female and male ends are in the form of a triangle but in the latter all in a straight line. I may change my rating to five stars after my next trip to India if it performs flawlessly."
4,Nice little surge protector.,"I recently purchased two new laptops for me and my wife. After having a computer get fried on me from a surge many years ago I try and be very careful with electronics now. These seemed like a good option instead of a surge strip because no matter where I plug them in, I know the have some type of surge protection. It's hard to rate how well they protect from surges unless they don't, then you know you've gotten a dud, but it's too late by then. I will say this though, where I live there are surges and quick 2 minute blackouts almost anytime it rains or thunders(don't ask me why)and so far so good. I also know from dealing with home theater electronics as a buisness that APC has a good reputation which was another reason I purchased these. They add about 10 inches or so to the overall length of your laptop charger which can be good or bad depending. Most of the time you won't even notice that it's there and it's a bit of added piece of mind."
5,Worth Every Penny,"This is one of the few collections of this type that I have found to be perfect in every respect. The songs cover every period, and include every important interpreter, from Dionne Warwick to the lesser-known Bacharach favorites. They have been selected with perfect taste, and the accompanying book is simply brilliant in its essays on the composer, lyricist, Warwick, and other topics, not to mention the priceless song-by-song commentary.Just reading through the song titles makes you realize -- if you hadn't already -- how important Bacharach and David are to the American popular song. This collection puts them in their place, right alongside Rodgers and Hart, Berlin, and Porter."
5,UNBELIEVABLE !!!!!,"I always knew the songs Burt did for Dionne Warwick but had no idea that he had written all these other songs originally performed by other people. Gene Pitney, Bobby Vinton, the list goes on and on. The enclosed summary of each song is fantastic and is interesting to read as you listen to the songs. I've only listened to one of three discs but can't wait to listen to the next CD to take a trip down memory lane. What a supurb talent."
3,somehow it misses the real burt bacharach spirit,"by concentrating on the whole story, from 1950's onward, this 4 cd sets somehow misses the best work of b.b. how can it be that, for instance, ""do you know the way to san jose"" from the man himself is not included? anyway, the presentation is fantastic, sound is very good, booklet is exceptional, however the record misses the real sad, multilayered melody, easy listening master concept. those who know him may be disappointed. the rest will just enjoy it..."
5,Complete Bacharach,"As a Bacharach fan for over 30 years, this collection is the most complete I could hope for. Most of these recordings were the first, not necesisarily the most famous recordings, of his most famous hits. While his songs with collaborator Hal David are most associated (especially during the 1960's) with Dionne Warwick, this collection showcases the wide array of performers with which he lent his talents. I never cease to be amazed at the string of hits this musical genius wrote over the years. Our only hope is that he continues to keep them coming!"
2,"Just okay, but not for $19","This game is basically just a big advertisement for John Deere and contains very little substance. I've actually gotten better kid games out of a cereal box. The $19 price tag is asking a lot. The game works, and my kid seems to like playing it, though perhaps only because it's there."
2,Ok... when it works,"On Windows ME and Windows XP PRO, the game gives IML32.DLL errors at various times. I am **STILL** waiting on a reply from Bold Games technical support -- a week since the technical support request.This is a cute game and my son enjoys it. But it is very annoying to say, ""don't play that part because it always crashes"" or ""sorry it messed up again."""
1,Don't waste your money,"Bought this for my grandson - age 3. Doesn't deserve even one star rating. Agree with other reviewer - it's going in the trash. What a waste of $20. So, save your money!"
1,Very little there,"My son, age 4, begged for this game. However, after he'd played it for the first time -- for all of a half hour -- he pronounced it ""boring"" and is unlikely to play it ever again. I agree with him, frankly. It is far less engaging than any other game he's tried at home, at school, or at the library. Once he'd mastered the basic gist of each of the six scenarios, that was it: there was no more complexity, no growing challenge, nothing interesting to explore or do."
1,Poor interface design,"I got this for my grandson and was really disappointed. At certain places, I had trouble figuring out how to operate the game. My grandson tried it, couldn't do much, and just quit the game.It requires that the original CD be put in the computer to run the game. It's going in the trash."
3,*sigh*,"Ok, dude, I've tried very hard to be patient with the S.M. TV series, so far, but unfortunately, it hasn't really been up to snuff. The animation is good and it is cool to see these chicks kicking arse, but the music becomes repetitive. Sometimes, I even found myself bored and half asleep while watching Silent Mobius. There were some good features to Friends and Family, though. The viewer gets insight to Yuki's past and a little of Rally's. There's also stuff on Katsumi's father and the Magician's Guild. I was suprised when I picked the video off the store shelf. The video was heavier than usual, because it contained 6 episodes instead of the usual 2. Frankly, you'd be better off reading the manga. This anime is probably more suitable for die hard S.M. fans or lazy bones who don't like reading. However, if you do want to see it, rent it."
1,Horrible,"This book is terrible. The first chapter is a ""marketing blurb"" for the product. The next 3 chapters all discuss either how to install other products (NT server and SQL 7.0) or how to use NT's Backup feature. I looked ahead to the later chapters (5 and up) and found very short and vague explanations of technologies in Site Server. After 4 chapters (112 pages! ) I was still not even told how to start working with the application. I DO NOT RECCOMEND THIS BOOK PERIOD."
1,Horrible..Not Worth a Penny,"Do not buy this book! It was horribly written. There is no real technical information about Site Server anywhere in this book. There is no way you could possibly pass the test with this book, so don't even try. I passed using the on-line documentation and hands on experience. I am writing a letter to the publisher to express my complete dismay with this book for it's lack of indepthness and preparation for the exam that it says it has."
1,MCSE Implementing and Supporting Web Sites Using Microsoft S,This is probably the worst MCSE Study Guide that I have ever purchased. Does the author even know about the subject? The examples are horrible and the content is horrible. People WILL NOT be able to pass the Site Server test after reading this book. This is the biggest waste of money. Please learn from my mistake and don't buy this book.
1,Useless,I found this book a completely useless waste of time. It will tell you all the wonderful things Site Server can do for you. It will not help you pass the exam.
1,You've got to be kidding me.,"Old Time Relijun is one of the worst bands I have ever heard, and I hear a lot of music. I bought it because I heard it was sounded like the more strange tendencies of Tom Waits and Captain Beefheart, but that is way too big of a compliment. This sounds more like somebody torturing diarrhetic goat on the rack. It is the some of the most unpleasent, atrocious crap ever. Trust me on this one.(P.S.-This review is valid for any Old Time Relijun album.)"
5,What a great push for reading!,"An excellent book for teaching the importance of reading and gaining an awareness of simlarities in plot. Poor Winnie learns that she may the next 'stuffed chicken for dinner' as a result of not wanting to read a famous tale. The story takes the reader on a rollercoaster of 'what-ifs' and creates wonderful moments for predicting text. I will be using this story for numerous lessons in my classroom, from developing a sense of story to partner predictions. Excellent illustrations, too!"
5,The Pre-Med Student's bible!,"THE absolute, most complete handbook for anyone seriously considering applying to medical school. From statistical information, to complete advice on every aspect of the process, to a thorough review of each and every medical school in the states and Canada. This is where you start, folks!"
5,Great Trim Nailer!,"I own my own contracting company and use this gun in the field. I must say, it is a great gun. I previously have used Porter Cable and that was a great product also. Several great things about the DeWalt. 1. It has a tool belt clip so you place it at easy acess when putting up trim. 2. It also has a multi positon exhuast head, so no more dust in the face.3. Its lightweight and also has a bump trigger. Great for driving multiple nails quickly. 4. Great line of sight for intricate wood work. Only down fall is the loading mechanism. If you load 3 clips of nails, the last clip has be pulled down past the lock. In time it may slide easier with a little wear, but brand new, its a little tight on the clips."
1,Buy at your own risk,"Like so many other customers have stated, this product lasted less than a year. In the first place, when the item was new, it needed to be turned almost all the way for ""average"" toast. Then, within 4 months of purchasing this four toast toaster, the two inside elements quit working. The inside bread (or bagel, etc.) would only be toasted on one side. I will not purchase a Hamilton Beach toaster in the near future."
4,Easy to use and to clean,"I replaced my old bagel toaster with this one, and I love it. It is easy enough for my youngest (4) year old to use, and because there is room for two bagels or four waffles/toast, everyone is happy in the morning. It is also very easy to clean and the food does not get stuck in the toaster slots."
1,Lasted about one year,"During that one year in use the intensity control knobs worked well. The stop at notch 2 made really difference from the stop at notch 3. I used both compartments about 3 times a week. However, the right compartment coil burnt out recently after about one year in service. Do I want to buy toasters on an annual basis? No."
4,Good Value,"This toaster is a good value, but needs to be turned all the way up for medium-toasted wheat bread. I like the long / wide slots and being able to push each set down separately."
1,Have had toaster for 2 months and it is burned out,The coil on the left sparked and died a month ago The one on the right is still working but unreliable. There is a burning odor coming from it. Is there a guarantee on this product?
1,"""TOASTER TEASE""","The Toaster worked good for about 6 months and then nothing buttrouble! Un-even toasting, settings not working.Now the right side 2 slots stopped working!This toaster is not a 1 Star, it is a NO STAR, ZERO, DO NOT BUY!Todays Toasters are designed to last about a year, too expensive and the market offers no real safety issues. What to Buy, I wish I could recommend my Grandmother's Toaster, but they don't make Great Toaster that last 20 years!"
1,worked less than a year,I bought this toaster after a long search for a four slot toaster. Needless to say it gave out as soon as the extra warranty I purchased with it did. The left side stopped working completely with no warning. I would not recommend this toaster.
1,"Erratic , inconsistent, unpredictable","If you like your toast burned on one side, golden on the other, this is the toaster for you. The bagel/toast option is great in theory but it does not work. I intend to put this little darling out of its' misery with a sledgehammer."
5,2nd time a charm,"I usually don't buy a product with a less than 4 star review, and honestly must have been tired the day I ordered this one when I went back and read the review. The first one that we received had to be returned. One side was very difficult to deal with. Sometimes it would stay down and sometimes it wouldn't. The replacement they sent has been fine though. We have been using it over a month with no problems at all. It's really a neat toaster, if you can get one that works."
3,I bought this at the dollar store,"Let me tell you, if you are planning to buy anything Radiohead, that this is almost the worst thing you can get. The only reason I got it was because I saw it at the dollar store, and keep in mind that I am a HUGE Radiohead collecter. I have all 6 of their albums, their I might be wrong Live EP, their Iron Lung EP, their Itch EP, Go To Sleep 1, Pyramid Song Single, and the Knives Out Single, as well as two interview discs. This one was the worst of the two.If you see it at the dollar store, pick it up. Otherwise, don't bother."
1,NEW SEX NOW - NOT APPROPRIATE DESCRIPTION...,"I thought this video would have been of some ""outstanding better way of loving making"". Instead, in my opinion, it is mostly a teasing lesson for the female partner, and also for the male partner which he practically uses his fingers during the ""whole"" time on this video(one focused). This lesson is not better sex, it's simply another approach to sex which doesn't match up to the title of the video, sorry."
1,Not worth the price,I purchased this DVD thinking it was going to help me and my boyfriend since it got such great reviews. I agree how this DVD had a low budget appearance and that most of it was spent with this guy talking to you. It's not as if the stuff he mentioned were things I've never heard of before. I was expecting more visuals than verbal. I hope that Amazon gives me more than a partial credit since I didn't bother watching the rest and just immediately returned it.
3,We Wanted To Learn Something,"We acquired this DVD to see if we could learn anything. And boy did we ever! For example, Arte explains in a detailed fashion exactly how to give pleasure. He follows it through step by step with easy-to-understand descriptions. He also tells us that his CHIEF GOAL in life is giving and receiving sexual pleasure. In addition to that, he tells us that he never met this woman before and was not in a long-term relationship with her. Let's see, what does that make him?We learned some things from Melody as well. For example, we learned that when she lies spread-eagle upon the bed, she looks like a bat. And judging by her moans you would think she is in labor.So there you have it folks. The low-down on this movie. Would I buy it again? Probably. But thank goodness for Amazon.com where you can resell it when you are done and dying to get it off your hands."
2,Low quality mass production boring,"Do not waste your money, boring and low quality. You will not learn anything from it."
1,What's wrong with old sex?,"Why do we need the new sex? Isn't the old sex good enough? The step-by-step roadmap is missing a few steps if you know what I mean. And some of the steps are too complicated, if you know what I mean."
3,Another hit for Lesiem,"Great for those looking for something different, it might not be everybodies cup of tea but is perfect for people looking for music that inspires the artistic soul."
4,"Not earth shattering music, but some catchy tracks.","I heard the track ""Navigator"" on Pandora and was instantly drawn to the track. Suffice to say I purchased this only track from Amazon and have had it on repeat play for a while...there is something about this specific track that grabs my ears. Yes, the sound is similar to other project fusion bands (the most well known being Enigma). The music is not revolutionary, but there are tracks here and there worth listening too.From what I gather, ""Navigator"" is about Columbus' discovery of the new world. The lyrics are in Latin sung in Gregorian style with audio clips of a Native American speaker probably speaking of the arrival of the Europeans (so I presume), but the musical arrangement is very cinematic and nicely done."
4,A pleasing Lesiem release,Lesiem should not be classified with Enigma. Enigma and Lesiem are far different in style. Lesiem stands on its own as a tribute to the human voice and the enchanting rythmns that this group provides. It is a magical journey in which the listener (me and you) should lie down relax and close your eyes and embark on a journey that each song takes you along.Wonderfully crafted songs with intrinsic beats that will not leave the listener for a long time to come
2,GREGORIAN CHANTS - A FLOYDIAN SLIP?,"Caveat emptor - don't buy into the intriguing promise on the cover that herein lie influences of ""Enigma and Pink Floyd"". Someone please ""illuminate"" me where I can find a trace of Pink Floyd here, thank you.It takes a great deal of musical creativity to cobble together the kind of epic compilations Michael Cretu's Enigma team is known to produce, but Lesiem seems to have picked up on one element thereof -- gregorian chants -- and spun a dozen tracks over what seems to be the same drum beats, hoping at least a few gullible shnooks would lap it up.The curious may be well advised to give ""La Rose"" and ""Roma"" a listen to get a general idea, but the rest of it is mostly self-same filler sung by your local choir's back row."
4,An aluring mixture of haunting chants and new age music,"Lesiem blurs the line between world/new age music. Most of the songs on Illumination focus on vocal chanting, but the music in the backround adds a new age element that keeps you listening. There are also multicultural influences abound...each track seems to have a different theme. For example...the song Africa uses African vocals and instruments, and Brittania carries a distict British atmosphere. I really can't think of a dull track on the album. The sticker on the cover claims Lesiem is ""for fans of Enigma and Pink Floyd"". While I can certainly see the Enigma comparison, there is not much to base a Pink Floyd comparison on (perhaps the electric guitar used in the second track?). Aside from that false ploy, Lesiem stands by itself as an intriguing new artist that will surely capture the ears of new age and world music fans alike."
3,Bucket Hat,I really liked the fabric and color of the hat but the brim is a lot wider than other bucket hats I've owned. It also runs bigger than other XL hats. I should have ordered a L instead. I washed and dried it in the machines hoping to shrink it a little.
2,bucket hat,I feel the hat is too stiff even after washing. The photo shows a rounded hat whereas it's (or at least the one I recieved!) not really at all. Just okay- I probably won't wear it.
4,Careful on Sizing....,"I received this hat and tried it on.... I was disappointed that it was slightly larger than I expected. It was the XL size, and I would have sent it back, but the shipping cost was 25% the cost of the item. The hat was purchased thru e4Hats.com. That's my problem, I guess. The hat itself seems well-made and rugged. I'm going to wear it anyway, but stay out of the wind!"
2,floppy hat,It's only a hat but it has no form like in the picture. I may wear it when I get to be old.
3,Slightly disappointed,"The music and the location are about the only thing that has anything to do with the Samba. So in that regard it was disappointing. The music is great and it is a good workout, but is not the Samba. So if you are looking to learn the Samba look elsewhere this is not it. It is simply a great workout to Samba music."
2,Not as good!!,"I was dancing to the workout but,get lost to fast.So,I stopped after 2 weeks.waste of money..spendit instead on austin videos.She is more details on what she is doing."
5,Nothing New Under the Sun,"Fans of modern day Pankration, as in the UFC, Pride and other such events, will be fascinated to read of the close parallels between the ancient and modern versions in terms of technique, match style as well as audience reception. Many of the same issues facing the sport today were dealt with by the ancients.More important perhaps is what is revealed regarding the importance and effectiveness of combat sports outside the competitive arena. Poliakoff quotes Homer, Alexander and others to make the point that boxing, wrestling and pankration may not be so effective in producing an effective warrior. Alexander, for instance, didn't approve of boxing and wrestling but did favor stick fighting. Champion athletes in the Iliad are cowardly in battle. The Romans blame the Greek love of ""games"" on their decline.Scholarly, readable, relevant."
3,I'd rather be punched in the face with an iron knuckled Caestus.,"Ok, that's a little severe... In truth an erudite academic overview, interesting, but lacking in charisma. The chapter on wrestling was a particular disappointment as it was limited to an analysis of Black-figure style depictions of wrestlers on Greek pottery which the author goes to lengths to decipher, but aside from pointing out what may or may not be a particular wrestling hold being applied on a particular piece there is not much offered. Wrestling aside, the chapters on Pankration and Boxing proved slightly more fulfilling, while the varied source materials documenting the deeds of the contemporary participants (sprinkled throughout, few and far between, like brilliant gems in dry clay) are completely fascinating and thankfully made the effort worthwhile."
5,Thinkpad: Reliable/ Excellent Warranty Repairs,"I am now on my third Thinkpad (I have actually bought four one as a gift). You cannot beat the quality construction, excellent support, and business friendly design. If you want a laptop that you can rely on for three years and if somethings does not work someone will replace it tomorrow for free then go with a Lenovo Thinkpad w/ onsite support. It is worth it."
5,Fit Perfect,"I bought this to install myself, however since my car needed additional service I had the mechanic install the belt. Save me money by supplying my own parts."
5,GREAT DEAL!,Bought it on Amazon. Had a few plastic boo boos...but who cares? The drill works as a drill for medium duty work. Don't take it to the job site. The trades use Milwaukee...
5,Good Bang For The Buck,"I bought this drill about a month ago. I was surprised to find that it looked brand new with no hints of wear,dirt or damage. I have been using it to do projects around house and have found that it works as well as some $200 drills that I have bought in the past.I was skeptical when I ordered it, but I am well pleased."
2,Tatar with mayonnaise,"2 1/2With exceptions in its short second half, this is a melodically weak, amateurishly programmed entry for electronic pioneer Paradinas."
2,not a movie,"this is documentary on acheology digging up bones. I requested a movie ""the land that time forgot"" and you send me a narative documentary of dinosaurs...if you do not have the movie, please refund my money or find the movie and send it.thank you."

5,Kaia-Voice of an Angel,"This album is amazing, I am at total loss for words. This is the first Butchies album I bought, and now it has forced me to look into buying the others. Kaia, singer-guitarist, has an amazingly peaceful voice at times, but when she screams she can totally change the feel of the song. She is amazing, and absolutely gorgeous and I think I have a huge crush on her! The only thing is that I wish her vocals were turned up more, she seems to be swallowed up during a few of the songs, but never the less, her voice still rings through. If you haven't seen them live, please go, you will have a fabulous time. They are great musicians!"
2,a bit too poppy for my taste really.,"if your into babes in toyland, heavens to betsy, and bikini kill and more interesting bands like that, i think you'll be quite disappointed with this.if you get rid of the song's political meanings, it just sounds like poppy indi punk crap.i really didn't like it.i researched them thinking i'd enjoy them, but really, my tastes differ from this poppy, simple indi type.the vocals aren't that impressive really, i don't feel like these ""feminists"" are actually politically progressive, their songs have a vulnerable air to them, a bit too sensitive and girly, they're songs don't really express the real fight attitude that feminism has. this isn't a very strong voice for young teenage girls.if you want something a bit more interesting...search for the bands i listed above.another real alternative to this band are Le Tigre."
2,Loaded - Catherine McCormack was the only redeeming quality.,"This bizzare tale of the filming of a horror movie left me feeling empty and dissapointed. The plot had many chances to thicken, but it never does. The actors do as best they can, but the script is poorly written. Many details begin to come up, but they are left in midair with no completion. This movie had many holes, but many attractive and talented actors in it."
4,Interesting,"The movie and its cast are oddly beautiful. The music is hauting also, I wish they sold a sountrack."
3,A good deal,"LitesNow Valo Instant Track Do-it-Yourself 3 Fixture with Shades Hardwire Pendant Light Kit, SilverYeah I know they're cheap plasticbut I bought them in red and amber to go with my track lights. I like them. Works for me. They look nice."
5,Great Add-on to LitesNow halogen fixtures,This was the perfect finishing touch to the LitesNow halogen fixture. It helps to focus light down and difuse light from the side. I recommend it highly for use with the LitesNow do-it-yourself kit.
1,DeWalt D55153 Comnpressor,"I purchased the compressor through Amazon and had no problems at all. The compressor is everything I expected it to be. I've used it with my DeWalt brad nailer putting up moldings, and with a rented floor nailer. The compressor worked exceptionally well for both applications. The compressor is not noisey which I was a little concerned with after reading other reviews. I have not used the compressor with a framing nailer but plan to in the near future. I did not realize that there were two types of fittings for compressors and tools, automotive and industrial. You cannot interchange the two so decide which ones to go with and stick with that. I do think one or the other is considered standard and I would probably go with the standard. The rental unit had a standard fitting on it, as I was told."
2,not so hot hot dog,"I returned the DeWalt compresssor because I believe it had been used, probably briefly, returned and reshipped to me. It arrived with considerable oil in the bottom of the carton. When attempting to initiate set up procedure, the owners manual was unclear and necessitated a call to a DeWalt service center. There was a considerable amount of oil in the crankcase, and an ounce (approx) of rusty water drained from the tanks when valves were opened; the service center rep advised that this should not have been the case. Additionally, pressure control valve is difficult to adjust because of location under the handle."
2,"Good compressor, poor design","This compressor does the basics well - compress air. The issues that I have are in the design of the unit.1. The bleed valve location is on the back of the unit next to the compressor motor, which makes it hard to access and there's burn potential for hands.2. The pressure gauge is behind the carry handle so vision is obstructed.3. The output pressure control valve is tight behind the carry handle.4. The hose connection faces the compressor motor rather than the front.It does the basics without complaint."
3,Cautiously Optimistic,First unit would not work-- froze up and blew the fuse each time I tried to use it. Good new was Amazon was SUPER FANTASTIC on replacing it. Second one has worked pretty well-- a couple of times I thought it was not going to start up but so far has worked. If it doesn't fail to start-- it is easy to use and works fine with my tools. Based on it being Dewalt I did have high expectations so I am cautiously optimistic that the first unit was a fluke and the second one will continue to work as expected.
4,Great Portable,"Recovery time was very good when using a framing nailer. Using a blowgun for cleaning was ok. Acceptable noise level. Used on a 100' extention cord off a 15 amp circuit, with no problems. I'm very pleased with it. Looking forward to many years of use in my shop."
4,After 1 room of flooring installation,"Product performed flawless during 3 days of flooring installation supplying air to a floor nailer and a finish nailer. Easy to break-in, easy to use. A bit more information on what is included would be helpful for future customers. A standard threaded single connection is all that is provided (perhaps I did not look close enough at the photos/literature) - no quick connects installed on this product. A quick trip to the local tool store and an hour is all that was required to remedy the situation."
2,Hard to start,"This compressor kicks out the overload on cold start ups. With an ambient temperature of 70 degrees and above I don't expect difficulties with start up, but I have to re-set the overload 5 to 6 times with the tanks empty. I had this identical compressor before (it was stolen) and I never had a problem with start-up unless it was below freezing.I am quite disapointed with this item."
5,Does a great job!,"I have the plastic jar $25 version and I was going to buy another for my Boston apartment, but I thought I'd splurge the extra [money] (big spender, I know) and get this one instead. I'm glad I did, this blender is fantastic. I have plastic jar version in my apartment in Montreal, and it just plain sucks, the jar cracked three weeks into having it and it can hardly cut through my morning smoothy. But this blender is far more effective and does a great job of everything I put it through, i.e. pureéing parsnips and carrots (a great recipe off of canadianliving.com, I highly recommend trying it for thanksgiving). Definetly skip the plastic 10-speed and get this one. It's a far better product."
1,Replacement Parts Are Hard To Come By!,"I bought one about a year ago. The blade locked up and couldn't be fixed. I looked online to order a new blade. The blade was $12.99, but the shipping was almost $30.00. For that price, I can buy a new one. And it won't be a Hamilton Beach. If you want ice crushing, don't buy this blender. Heck, just don't buy this blender."
1,You get what you pay for...,"I agree with the other low reviews below. After one use, the blender started smoking, smelling funny, and then quit altogether. I originally was sold on the cheaper price, but I will definitely be upgrading to a blender with power."
2,Big Disappointment!,My sister & I both purchased this on sale about a year ago and have had nothing but trouble with it. After using it several times it would start smoking and we would have to shut it off and allow it to cool off before restarting it. Sometimes you could also see sparks in the back of the motor. I sent mine back once and my sister twice! My sister has since given up and bought another brand. I'm currently shopping around for a different brand before it burns the house down!!
3,Mixed Opinions.,"I had read good review regarding this blender on Amazon, hence the purchase. After using it a few times, I have mixed opinions. The blender looks good, the cord coiling under the machine is convenient to store. It does well with large quantities of stuff to be ground. But, if you have small quantities, the blades don't work so well. They are too high to get stuff under the blades. So for small powdering jobs or grinding small quantities of coconut (for example), it takes a while and is not perfectly satisfactory. If you want to smooties, it works great. It needs better designed blades. My old one probably had better blades, sadly the jar leaked and needed replacing."
2,Not a good basic blender,"It is only good for making banana shake. The cover is like plastic. I am not happy at all with this product, I purchased it just because of the price, never gonna do that too"
1,This is a real looser,This blender is not worth the money. It's not strong enough to crush ice.After a short amount of time the cutter assembly froze up and a new cutter costs almost as much as a new blender. Avoid this dog.
1,Worked For One Drink,The second time I used this blender it started smoking and quit working. I highly suggest trying a different brand.
2,Buy another blender,I bought this blender less than three years ago and I am now in the market for a new one. The moter smells when I put in frozen fruit. I have to shake it back and forth just to get it to blend everything. So here I am searching for another one.
4,Smells wierd,"Everything about the blender is good for the price. Only thing is that the base, on which the blender jar sits, has a very wierd smell"
1,I'm glad it is not in stock anymore,I used this blender for less than 2 years...it's just a piece of junk. Smells badly and now the blade got locked. I am not sure I would consider Hamilton Beach again.
5,Malory Towers is the best!,This book was very book because i loved to hear about boarding school and the author was very descriptive when describing the characters. I think you should read this book and i think you will like it.
4,High Energy At It's Best,Tracklisting:A1 High Energy (7:50)A2 High Energy (Remix) (8:37)The Evelyn Thomas Mega-Mix: (14:10)B1 High EnergyB2 MasqueradeB3 Second Best
5,The Best Breyer Book Around,"This book is amazing! The pictures and descriptions are so great and it's so up to date which makes it great for all collectors. This book even goes into details about flaws in models, etc and different colour variations of certain models. In my opinion this book is a MUST HAVE for any breyer collector. I know it's certainly helped me find values of models and to help me look for ones that i've missed out on."
3,Unreliable,"When I use this product it requires more time to clear feed jams than I spend actually setting brads. I have used a variety of 18 guage brads including Spenco and Bostitch - no difference. I have tried lubing and not lubing - no difference. I have adjusted pressure at the (DeWalt) compressor from low end of the recommended range to the top end - no difference. I have used the depth setting up and down - no difference. I have had a couple of days when misfeeds have been rare and others when it takes clearing a misfeed five times for each brad that is set. Amazon was no help. By the time I finished trying different brands of brads and adjusting everything it was more than 30 days from date of purchase - no help from Amazon at all. I have a cheapo HF model - been using 10 years with only rare misfeed - but it only shoots 1 1/2 inch brad not 2"". DeWalt could take some lessons in reliability from the maker of that one. I would not buy again."
4,Nice Brad Nailer,"Has never misfired, yet. It's light and easy to adjust for depth. Have no regrets on purchase."
5,Zachary stewart,This is a great tool great for odds and ends projects good with trim and framing shelfs I made my dog a bed and he won't sleep anywhere else
1,Woodshop work,"I bought this item two years ago. I don't really use it all that often and it seems to have problems.The two inch Brads Jam. I ordered new parts and installed them and it still jams on 2"" brads. All other size brads work without jamming. It really cost me a couple of man hours with the 2"" brad choke. The next garage sale it's gone. I'll stay with Bostitch and Senco, they are my workhorses."
1,Don't by this one.,"People say that dewalt tools are some of the best tools out there, so thats the reason why I bought this brad nailer. When I recevied it I tried it out. I had problems with it from the start, 18 out of 20 times it miss fired leaving little holes in the wood. I bought the rite nails for it to. The finish on it scratches very easly, so it won't take long for it to look very bad. I also went through the troublesooting in manual and it did'nt help. Dewalt decided to come out with the nailers this year so they have alot of problems to work out yet. There also made in taiwan."
5,Top of the line,"I recently purchased this brad nailer and was very pleased when it arrived. Like most DeWalt tools it came in a heavy duty carrying case that perfectly housed the nailer and had enough room to fit a few small items like a box of nails and eye protection, oil, ect... And speaking of eye protection, DeWalt threw in a sweet pair of them for free! They are adjustable and have the small yellow DeWalt logo on the side. Definitely a nice surprise.The nailer itself is super light (~2lbs) and so far has worked really well for me. It has a lot great features that make adjusting the drive height and clearing jams super easy. The nailer also has a safety switch that can be easily engaged (and dis-engaged) with the same hand that your holding it with. It's perfect for when you need it and stays out of the way when you don't.I would definitely recommend this quality tool to anyone who is looking for a versatile and easy to maintain nailer for under $100."
5,DeWalt D51238K 5/8-Inch to 2-Inch 18-Gauge Brad Nailer,"After banging away at finishing nails and punches for years and years, and after bending nails and denting the surrounding wood, I finally gave in and purchased the DeWalt Nail gun. It's like dying and going to heaven.The thing works like magic - just push the gun against the molding, pull the trigger and the nail imbeds itself perfectly. I should have bought the thing 15 years ago.So far, the gun has worked flawlessly.One note: The hardness of the wood determines how far the nail will go into the molding - fiberboard seems to be harder than natural wood, so use the depth adjustment knob to add some extra power when nailing into a composite material. There's not much more to say. Buy it."
4,Worth every penny,"I have only done a couple of projects so far, but already know I am going to really enjoy having the DeWalt Brad Nailer. The adjustments are easy to change depending on the project. It makes the job almost fun when it used to be dreaded. The gun is light weight and easy to handle. The directional exhaust is a plus. Brad loading is quick and easy. I can complete jobs quicker and with higher quality than ever before. The price has been reduced since I made my purchase which is just my luck. Looking forward to seeing how the product performs over time with additional home projects."
1,displeased,"This product only lasted four days. During that time, the gun would constantly jam/ misfire. On the third day, the slide assembly that strikes the head of the nail failed to function properly. I removed the rear cover to find that the assembly became canted within the tube. I had to use a rubber mallet and wooden peg to dislodge the assembly. The gun returned to normal function full of jams and continuous misfires. The next day the assembly canted itself again. I own numerous things made by Dewalt because the name has become irreplaceable to me over the years. It pains me to do this but I can not recommend this nailer by Dewalt."
1,The reviews are true....,"I hestitated purchasing this brad nailer from Amazon after reading the reviews, there were so many that were mixed. Guess I like to gamble. Well, it didn't pay off. Received the nailer, purchased 2"" nails from Home Depot (no free nails were supplied by DeWalt) and hoped to go to work. Well, I think that the manufacturing tolerence on the magazine is a bit off. The 2"" nails wouldn't slide smoothing in the magazine clip and kept binding. I decided to call DeWalt and spoke to a representive questioning if there was a specific brand of nails I should be using. He told me that it didn't matter and that all brands should work with the gun. I next went on the Amazon site and returned it. Obviously something was wrong...."
1,jams,"I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas. He just put it to work and he is ready to throw it. It does a nice job, but it jams almost every third nail. He shot is less than 30 times and had to unjam it 8 times. Finally it jammed again and he couldn't get it fixed. So....now he is using the good old hammer. That was a waste of money. I should have given more credit to the bad reviews on here. :-/"
5,Nice Nailer,I have only used this nailer a few times installing trim in my house and am very satisfied with the way it works. I am a fan of Dewalt tools and think they are one of the better made tools out on the market.
5,Effortless,"Bought this nailer for applying window trim in a screen room being enclosed with glass to convert it to a 4-season room. Sure beats holding the nail & llightly tapping it with a hammer & then worrying about accidentally hitting the glass with the hammer. There is no recoil & the only thing slowing me down is how fast the sleeve of nails disappears! No misfires, no problems, a real joy to use. Got the work done in at least 1/3 the time compared to a hammer & nail."
3,No Air Inlet Fitting? Really?,"I am a general contractor, and I have many air-powered tools and air nailers. This one showed up without an air inlet fitting...really! I transported the new, factory packaged and sealed tool to a job site knowing I would have to buy the right brads even if the manufacturer had provided a sample package as some provide. However, because the tool did not come with an air inlet fitting (Male adapter) it was useless that day.I cannot believe that Delta would sell a tool like this without the 50 cent adapter that makes the tool job ready - save the allen wrench guys and think about using the tool from the contractor's perspective. Jeez..."
2,Not so Happy with purchase,Bought from amazon for installing interior molding. I have shot maybe 300 nails. 3 Jams. At least one was due to hitting another nail. So it works. I don't know if it works better then a nail gun half its price.Watch the amazon price it floats above and below the box stores.Update. This thing jams like crazy now. Oiled it every time I used it. Which was like for 10 small jobs.
5,Super Duper Nail Gun,"It was and is awesome. Makes life a little easier and is easy to control.It has never jammed and, well it looks nice too.Long Live the DeWalt company."
2,disappointing,"This was a once-over-lightly story with no depth. Having been charmed by the nuances and character development in Good Time Girl, I was primed to love this follow-up. Instead I found that I didn't much care for Jo Beth who was shallow, cranky, snooty and obsessed with what the neighbors would think. I also felt the pace of the novel was very rushed, with them going from a first sexual encounter to an unbelievable ""true love"" in six days. I thought that both Clay and the reader deserved better."
5,The Cowboy Way,"I love everything Candace Schuler writes. There's always a great plot and great characters. If you're not reading her books, you should be. They are always a joy! I've got the printed versions. It's a real treat to now have them out on Kindle."
3,I'm not really pleased with this book...,"I know that LightWave is an exelent program for organic modeling. So I looked forward to learn more about metanurbs and patch modeling techniques. But I found only few words about it. Instead, the autor spent 2/3 of the book explaining in detail how to build a perfect castle. Yes, it looks nice, but that's not what I was looking for. Also the book has a lot of mistakes, but they're usually obvious."
3,Great Information de-railed by too many errors,"Wonderful content, great tips, etc.... But so many technical errors that every tutorial in the book turns into garbage (ie millimeters instead of meters or vice versa, x instead of y axis, etc. etc.) Otherwise, with a little logic, the book offers some great tips and tricks."
1,Blackberry Pearl doesn't fit,"Pushing a Blackberry Pearl into this case, ALL the keys are pushed and almost impossible to remove from case. Worthless for this phone. Case returned."
1,Compressor lasted 5 minutes then died.,"I was unable to use this product immediately due to an accident. When I first used it the 30 day warranty was a week expired, the compressor lasted less than five minutes, made an awful noise, then totally quit. I have e-mailed Auto Barn (the supplier through Amazon) and they have never had even the courtesy to respond. In a recent check, this compressor was no longer listed in Amazon but wherever you might see it, I strongly recommend that you spend a few dollars more and get something like Black & Deckers inflator that has a 2 year warranty and works. I will purchase nothing ever again from Auto Barn."
5,Air Compressor,Interdynamics 120V PowerAir Air CompressorWorks very well! I had a tire that was continually loosing air and thiscame in very handy! Just make sure you have an extension cord. Excellent product!!
3,"Beautiful, but only briefly","After my old Kodak at work gave up the ghost, I read some reviews, including yours, and decided on the Agfa CL30. Shortly after installing the software in the computer and connecting the camera, the batteries got very hot and it ceased working permanently. The first (and only) pictures I took were of far greater quality than my old digital camera. In other words, while it was working, I was very pleased. But obviously, there are some quality problems"
2,Great in High bad in Low resolution,"Pictures taken in High resolution are realy nice, although colors are shifted litle a bit to blue, but when you set to Low Res to spare some memory space, pictures get some unexpected and ugly artifacts on homogenous surfaces (like face for example).That's not only due to lower resolution but rather to something wrong in software resizing in camera's firmware itself.If you take HiRes and resize on you PC, everything is OK.If you want to be able to store 30+ pictures on your digital camera (you'll have to use Low Res), don't buy CL30. If you don't care how many pictures you can store before download, for less then 300$ you'll have nice 1M pixel / USB digital camera."
2,Good entry level camera,"This camera was my first digital camera. It served the purpose at the time. You really need to fool around with the controls to get a good picture. I suggest that you get rechangeable battery unit as it eats battery life. I found the camera to be very heavy. People who have Windows ME operating system do not buy this camera. Afga at this times does not have drivers for the CL 30 for Windows Me. For the price, you can get a far better camera with higher resolution. (...) Digital cameras have come a long way in 2 years. (...)"
2,Not great...,"The agfa e-photo smile camera itself would be fine, IF it didnt shut off thinking it had a low battery after you take only 2 or three shots. This happened in 2 - I ordered a second to be sure it was the camera. And the help line for Agfa is useless at best. They told me to try a camera battery and that would solve everything, EVEN THOUGH the camera CAME with two REGULAR alkalines and NOWHERE In the brochure does it say it needs that special battery. Id try another camera. Agfa IS generally a good brand, perhaps not with their low models, though. Pictures also very very very grainy in poor light."
4,A flat-chest pretty babe,"I love this camera. I used to be doubting on my purchase before it arrived because some other models sounds pretty attractive too, but now I am pleased with it. The features are great, some of which should belong to more expensive ones. The usb interface kick the hell out of serial's. That's a real kick. It is very easy to take a high quality snapshot. The picture seems really nice to me. The sad stuff about the camera is it eats batteries like a horse. My brand new 4 AA batteries were sucked in 30 mins. I couldn't quite figure out where in the world the energy had been gone to. I am gonna buy some rechargeable batteries to kill this problem. Oh, ha, no underwear for the lens. You'd better not touch it. Anyway, it is a very nice little cutey. I like it a lot."
2,They suck you in ...,"There was a skit with horse racing, which was colorized, but not actually the famous short. Snipits of that were interspersed with a lot of black and white footage. What got me to buy was the picture on the front, which was of their classic golfing short, one of the best they've ever done. They colorized the picture, making me think that the short would be in the program, but it wasn't. That's bait and switch, folks, and I wouldn't recommend this DVD to even the most rabid of colorization fans, for after watching this, they will feel that there is a large ""SUCKER"" sign that was just placed on their forehead."
3,Stooge Rarities,This was worth while for a Stooges fan. Lots of Curly Joe Dorita since he was the last new stooge in the TV era. Commercials and TV appearances abound.
1,These clips should have stayed in the bin,"Guess you'd have to be an extreme Stooges fan to enjoy this. I didn't. Just a few minutes of behind-the-scenes stuff and a lot of very poor (and colorized) material. A few laughs, but not worth the time."
3,Good Under Ideal Conditions,"This tool can be made to work, and can save blades. But, it is far from perfect. Keep a test board with a known nail handy, and swipe it occasionally during use. Otherwise, the tool will drift off sensitivity, and you won't know it until your $$ carbide blade tells you... The tool is VERY sensitive to humidity, which is fine if you're in one of those spiffy shops that Fine Woodworking is always featuring, but if you're under a tin roof shed on a humid, rainy day, trying to turn salvaged heart pine siding into flooring, well... just forget it."
4,It works as advertised,"I have purchased both units separately. The small unit can pickup heads of nail etc in walls but it is not sensitive enough to check for metal in wood before planing. The large red unit is great - it has an ear piece so you can hear sound as it senses metal while you in a noisy shop or other area as well as a vibrating mode or both.I did one sensitivity test. I drove 1/2"" 18guage finish nail from my air gun into a 3/4"" block of wood recessing it a fraction of an inch below the surface. The big unit picked up the brad on both sides of the wood. The little unit couldn't find it. I believe it's because their isn't enough mass in the tiny nail. If you like to recycle lumber or repair old furniture then the red unit will save your planer and saw blades which = frustration and money. It's great for finding hidden nails in repaired furniture"
4,Wizard III Capability,"Although slow to be shipped (after two weeks) the detector seems to work as advertised. I tested scrap oak with embedded 18 gauge by 1/2"" brads, heads removed, and found the Wizard detected them at depths up to 1/4"", sufficient to protect my surface planer. Follow the manufacturer's recomendation to perform two scans, the second scan at 90 degrees from the first, or you can miss horizontal nail orientations. The audible warning feature is a plus for these small objects."
4,"Should've bought one before running wood thru my new 15""","This is an excellent tool! I should have purchased one before runnig recycled wood through my new 15 inch planer. Oh well, live and learn.I tested mine by hiding an office staple under a board. It found it much to my surprise. This puppy certainly is sensitive.Now the sour part. Like most new tools today there is a weak spot. The battery holder is poorly designed. It came out OK, but will not stay seated with a battery installed. It continues to drop out. I called the 800 number and they promised to ship me TWO replacements - maybe a trend??? The method of retainment is poor at best. Until the new clips arrive, the clip is duck taped on. Kinda sad for a brand new...tool!"
1,Disappointed,"I bought the Wizzard III end of march 2011 and went to use it in May for the first time. Unit would not stay powered up. Replaced battery with a new one and still would not work. As per Wizard Ind. Instructions I emaild them for a return autherization form. They will not return a reply. Their customer service phone has a massage that says it is not monitored and it will not take messages, goodby. I will turn this over to the BBB but I think I'm out my $150.00 . If I could give this a minus 5 stars I would."
1,Disappointment,"I purchased an earlier model of this tool maybe two years ago and was happy with the results over time (I don't use it every day) despite the hassles getting the sensitivity adjusted prior to use. Then.... I got it out to check some recycled wood (which I use a lot) before running it through my planer and it would not work despite several new batteries and attempted adjustments. I also tested the batteries to verify that they were not the issue. With the half dozen times that I used this tool and its cost, I would not recommend it to anyone. Based upon others' experiences with lack of response from the manufacturer and the tool's failure I would consider this tool as a very poor consideration."
1,Lumber Wizard Metal Detector,"Don't buy this item. I tried 2 Lumber Wizard Metal Detectors and neither one worked. The first just gave a constant beeping sound. I returned that one and received another from Amazon. The second metal detector could be adjusted to work, but the sensitivity kept changing. It would beep constantly, then not beep at all when held near metal. In other words, it would work sporadically. Also, when not in use, it completely drained my battery over an 8 hour period.In short, I was zero for two and cannot recommend the Lumber Wizard Metal Detector."
3,"A good, basic metal finder..............................","Great for large areas to search for metal, but not so good on narrowing down the location of said metal."
4,A repeat purchase,This is the second time I have bought one of these. The addition of the lazer beam is a great addition.
1,Doesn't last,Used it 3 or 4 times and it did work. Now it just beeps constantly and can not be adjusted. A total waste of money.
2,Campy fun,"I bought this DVD since I liked Deathstaltker 2. Very bad acting, so bad it is funny. Scantly clad babes and guys swinging swords, what else would we want ?"
5,"Insightful, rich and textured history of a truly awful institution","It's hard to imagine that anyone ever believed that slavery was a good thing, not just for the masters but also for the slaves, but guess what - as an institution it's probably as old as mankind and nobody ever had a problem with it until it became industrialized on the New World's sugar and cotton plantations. Davis tells this complex story with authority, backing up his thesis with hard data. He writes very well, and his erudition, professionalism and scholarship show through on every page. It's an excellent history of slavery and abolition, and leaves the reader with a lot of food for thought."
4,"Great Research, Bulky Read","In under 350 pages, David Brion Davis presents a wealth of information for those exploring the history of slavery for the first time or for readers seeking additional information to supplement past books and articles.Unfortunately, it reads like a choppy college lecture, with the flow of material marred oftentimes by the circular exploration of material. A topic may be introduced, then discussed in depth later and then reintroduced for concluding remarks many pages later.Davis utilizes numerous resources from contemporary historians and it is appreciated that he introduces the author and the work to the reader while quoting from the material.Inhuman Bondage is an important work in the growing number of books covering the sordid past that has been ""conveniently"" ignored or flippantly tossed aside in past historical writings.By coming to terms with the past and acknowledging the damage it has done is the only way the words from Davis and others will truly have full meaning."
4,"Gabby's the Man, get the CD, but make sure you see them live","The Cadillac Tramps cut loose with their classic O.C. punk rock. The album presents a taste of their classic sound that can only be truly appreciated when seen live. The band is pure entertainment onstage. Gabby, lead vocals, is a hard hitting frontman with large vocals and even a larger body. The album is a key buy, but the bottom line is that you have to see them live."
3,A Jewish Porn Talent,This doco testifies that even pornography is contributed with Jewish natural talent Rod Jeremy non-stop actions and outstanding appendage exemplify.Funny doco-comedy of rather dramatic life of aging porno-star still able and keen to entertain is of a general interest.
5,the legend of ron jeremy,it's great. at least i know how did he do with his life.please tell him that keep up acting.
3,Should have been a lot more,"Ron Jeremy is one of, if not the least, likely people to be a porn star. Ron is dying to break into mainstream movies. Ron is just your average, nice guy.Throughout the film these three facts are somewhat repeated ENDLESSLY but through various friends, family, admirers and co-workers.Its an entertaining, but short documentary that barely scratches the surface of what people really want to know about the world of porn. We learn all about Ron's amazing ""talents"" and his former loves...but the rest of the DVD is Ron trying to understand why no one from Hollywood will hire him.Yea, the AIDS test is scary....and should be....but that's really all there is on the serious side. The rest is Ron being a class clown. Fun and entertaining to watch...but what ISN'T said would be a heck of a lot more interesting."
3,It i a good toy for a girls,"It is a beautiful toy, but I don't believe that it is very resistant, the novelty for a girl, is that you can change the doll's style."
3,Little girls like this.,I bought this for a friend's 9-year old daughter. She thinks it is great. Hopefully she will grow out this phase.
5,"Well written, thoroughly researched, well documented","Scott Ellsworth has produced what is now the most important work regarding Tulsa's 1921 race riot. While Ellsworth's conclusions may be argued, his skills as a researcher and historian are exemplary and reviews to the contrary can be discounted as meritless. This work is an important link to understanding the civil rights movements of the 50s & 60s. There is no way to lay blame for all of the riot on any group, and Ellsworth is careful to point out the failings of both whites and blacks. The underlying issues of economies and a strong black community are well developed and examined as catalysts of the violence that followed. Ellsworth also spends considerable time examining the reconstruction of black Tulsa and the ongoing tension between the races as the community tried to recover. This is an excellent work that deserves more attention than just the narrow audience of historians and scholars."
1,Revisionist History At Its Best!!!,"Death In A Promised Land is a poorly researched and quickly written acount of the 1921 Tulsa Race Riots. As a scholar, I am trained to ""slow down"" and take all the time I need to research a subject before my ""pen hits the paper"".I call this book revisionist history because it unfairly fails to describe the role of the black citizens in the bilateral Tulsa race riots. Of course, the authors did not mention the black contribution to the riots, after all, when your 2 day research effort fails to uncover unfair business practices conducted by blacks prior to the riots, why bother to mention that blacks ""threw the first stone"" that day?Chris Keeley"
2,This book seems to be clearly biased.,"Many of the ""facts"" in this book are clearly in dispute. Other historians and researchers have uncovered evidence that contradicts or even debunks some of the supposeded events. This book seems to try and make the 1921 Tulsa Race WAR look like a very one-sided affair, with whites being ""guilty"" and blacks being ""innocent"". The truth is that both sides were at fault. A war broke out, and the blacks lost."
1,Nothing GREW!,I live in a climate where these things grow all over the place naturally. I seeded and nothing came up in my seed starter trays. I did some that I cold stratifed and some without CS just in case. And the result was ZERO! Bad seed is my guess.. I can make anything grow.
4,GOOD,"This product compares right to the CD Writer from HP. Burning is very easy with this propduct. Good for the money, also"
1,Don't waste your money,I got this book through an inter-library loan and had no idea what it was like until I brought it home. A couple of minutes of flipping through it was enough to make me realize that this was not a book that I wanted to waste time reading. I really detest books that are arranged in a dictionary format. Didn't the author and publisher ever come across the concept of an index?
2,Dictionary Formats are Great for Dictionarys not Comp. Books,There on the cover it read More Information about Dreamweaver Than Some Full-Sized Books - but I really doubt it. At 8.4 x 5.5 inches this book is small and the information content is small. The material is represented in alphabetical dictionary format but you really would not want to use it as a refrence book. It although the book does not get technical it is not really presented in a format for beginners to Dreamweaver.It claims to have descriptions of more than 300 terms and tasks but a beginner needs more than a book about memorizing keystrokes and terms. They need a book that presents concepts instead of memorizing keys and terms.The upside .... it took no more time to read than a cup of coffee at the corners shop.A white and yellow pages phonebook will always have more information than my personal phonebook. Doesn't make it any more useful than my own. It is all in how it is presented.
4,How to transfer recordings to PC ????,"I bought this recorder for recording purposes. To me, it does a great job in offering the sound quality that I really need.The problem I have with is transferring from the recorder to my PC. The original software that comes with this recorder does not allow users to do just that. Thanks for the inconvenience Sony!It took me almost what seemed to be all day to1) Download a ""audio capture software""2) find an minijack analog cable....whatever that isIts a very good device, sound quality wise, but, Sony needs to come up with a program that allows users to transfer from Minidisk ( MD ) to the PC."
1,Can't Transfer Self-Recorded Files To Computer,"DO NOT buy this unit if you want to record via a microphone and then transfer the file to your PC. You can't do it.I bought the Net MD Walkman MZ-NF810, paid another $100 for a microphone, used the unit to record a lecture, and then discovered that there is no easy way to get the files to my computer. Very disappointing. The only way to hear the recording is through the headphones.I have no other complaints. Unfortunately, the inability to transfer files defeated the purpose of buying the unit. I could have gotten the same result using a $15 cassette recorder!"
1,Buyer Beware,"Sound quality is excellent. But that's where the pros stop. Sony has masterminded bad business tactics by effectively gimping the MZ-NF810. No line-out. How many quality recording devices do you know have no line out? Sony does not say anything about this unusual design on their website or product packaging.Therefore, anything you record with your MD from analog sources, vinyl, cassette, reel-to-reel, microphone,is locked in the very unpopular MD world. Their software which allows you to transfer audio from computer to the MD uses language like ""check-in"" and ""check-out"" to wean the Sony consumer off of the ability to freely record and transfer music. Sony is out of touch.Bottomline: Don't buy the Sony MZ-NF810."
4,Line out,"Although the unit has no jack labeled 'Line Out', the headphone jack will work for that purpose. Use a high volume level."
1,"Stay Away, a rip off","The software will only work on computers with ""factory installed"" windows, and even then is very difficult to use. If your windows installation was not done in a factory on a pre-built computer, you can not upload or download data to the minidisc player. I only discovered this after a hellish experience with sony tech support. STAY AWAY."
1,Not a Christian read,"This book was recommended to me, but I thought it was a Christian book... though it cites some scripture, I quickly discerned this was not inspired by the Holy Spirit."
1,Road to Hell is paved with Good Intentions,"The Greatest trick the devil ever did was to convince the world he didn't exist. Unity ""church"" is herecy. I'm into the message of love, but this whole ""evil"" doesn't exist thing is dangerous and misleading."
5,Uncover the Human Body,"Because the book Uncover the Human Body is so complete, I have found it a wonderful teaching tool for my granddaughters. Systems in mammals are so similar that I purchased this book as well as Uncover a Cat and Uncover a Dog! The organs are also similarly named and will undoubtedly help my granddaughters learn about their own bodies!!! Future veterinarians love learning about animals and themselves!!!Last Christmas I purchased Uncover a Horse because they LOVE HORSES and ride them now!!! Remember ""Pets Require Responsibility""!!! Know how to take care of your animals!"
5,This is a great teaching tool for kids,"I love this book and so do my grand kids. The pages open to reveal the parts of the human body, layer by layer. Each page is full of information about all the systems of the body. It is simply enough written for the younger kids to catch onto, yet advanced enough for older kids. Each time we get it out we go over just a little on each page. I have even learned a couple of things from the book and I have been a medical professional for 20 years! Very well worth the money if you have children you want to educate on the human body. The kids are facinated by the body parts and love flipping the pages back and forth to see the body come apart and then back together. The pages are thick and the body parts are good plastic, so it is durable."
3,Uncover the Human Body,Somewhat disappointed with this book. I thought you could disassemble the parts. You cannot....If you just want to look at parts of the body in 3D this is a good book.
3,"Great Book, Horrible Condition","I ordered this for my six year old who is fascinated with this series. The Human Body is an exciting reference book for elementary students and I would recommend it to anyone with children interested in anatomy. PLEASE NOTE*** I was in shock to receive it in such poor condition when making a ""new"" purchase from Amazon. Thus, I reordered the book at the bookstore and donated the ""used"" copy to charity."
2,Inaccurate because the plastics veins are sticking out of the body,"I thought this would be neat because of the rave reviews. I see where the concept is nice, but it is inaccurate. For my kindergartener, I think a transparency would be more ideal. I wish someone would recommend something."
4,Backward bone,"The ""Uncover"" series are very nice books but the human anatomy book has the pelvic girdle bone placed backwards. It's a pretty huge mistake and I noticed it immediately. Other than that it's a pretty good book."
5,fun for all ages,"My 7 year old, 4 year old and I all have fun looking at this book. it can be used as in introduction to the human body for younger children or to study more deeply for older children. And it's just fun to watch how all the parts interlock and open up."
4,Very cool!,"I ordered this to do an at-home science curriculum with my son, along with some other human body products. When this came, I thought it was very original and cool! I guess I didn't realize what it would be like when I ordered it, and it is a lot neater than I expected. My 8 year old son thinks it is interesting to look at, and easy to understand. Every page you turn basically removes a layer of the human body to uncover the next layer and descriptions corresponding to the newly uncovered organs, bones, muscles, etc. I have never seen anything like this book. Very unique idea! Great way to give your kids a hands-on experience when learning about the body and to learn how all our parts fit, and work, together. The only thing I took off a star for is the possible durability of this book. The body pieces are pretty fragile, and you have to close the book just so to get it to all fit together. Maybe this is why they rate it ages 9-12, too, because younger kids would probably destroy it."
4,Human Body Book,"This is a very fun and informative book. My kids (7 and 9) loved it, but what's even better is I think I loved it even more."
2,The parts don't come apart,It is okay but I wish the parts came apart. Otherwise it is a good book to teach kids on.
2,Simple entertainment,"This was a novel of simple plot, characters, and narration. I must start out by saying that what kept me reading this book was that I kept visualizing Somerville and other landmarks mentioned in this book since I live there. However, this was really one of the most ridiculous stories/plots I have read in a long time. (Come to think of it, I can't remember any.....) Most of the time I felt like I was reading a Harloquin romance novel. Although the idea of a 60 year old couple finding romance is nice, the cheesy narration seemed like it should have come out of a 16 year old. The other characters had very little depth and seemed way too one or two dimentional.I give this two stars for Somerville and it being written by a nurse."
4,Julie & Romeo,"The cover is so beautiful and bright you can't help but gravitate toward it. The story is just the same. A very sweet love story, filled with warmth that demonstrates the power of love. It also proves that passion occurs at all ages and stages in life! The ending is even a bit suprising. A light read, but a lovely story."
5,One of POPs PICKs,"A very nice love story. And yes, they are seniors! I've loaned my copy out to different friends and they have all emjoyed it. It may not be great literature but it is one of the more pleasant reads this year."
2,Typical Siticom Pap,Triteness for triteness sake. So predictable. It's news that there is a life and sexual desire after 60? What great cover art! Think about it.
2,I really wanted to like this book...,"I feel lost in a sea of glowing reviews, but I have to agree with ramson, I just didn't like this book. I couldn't see how decades of hatred could be changed in so short a period of time, it didn't ring true. The characters had no life on the page unless they were fighting with each other, and I found myself skipping paragraphs to get to some plot movement.I did like the location, and many of the author's touches worked regarding the New England location, except for one. In Massachusetts we never go ""up the Cape,"" as was stated in the book. We only go ""down the Cape,"" no matter where we are."
4,bh casserly pd4,"For such a short novel this book sure made me feel all different emotions. I laughed, felt sorry for everyone and even felt hatred towards others. It was an easy read and hard for me to put down. I would recommend this book to anyone who was looking for a short comical read."
5,Charming!,"My book club needed something a little light for this month. This book was recommended and it was JUST what the ""doctor"" ordered.It was charming, fun and lighthearted.If you are looking for something fun to read - this is a great choice."
4,I'll be generous,"The awkwardness of dating as a single parent is a frequent subject for light comedy in TV and the movies. This book extends this genre by having the protagonists be aged 60, with grandchildren in the mix.Reading ""Julie and Romeo"" is like reading a screenplay for a Nora Ephron movie. You're sure that it's the sequel to ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and ""You've Got Mail."" Tom Hanks will have some grey flecks in his hair as Romeo, and Meg Ryan will need some lines in her face to play Julie, but otherwise everything is set up for them.I enjoyed the book. I laughed. I bought into the romance. I was more into ""Julie and Romeo"" than I was into ""You've Got Mail."" However, I have a relatively low tolerance for Hollywood manipulation (don't get me started on ""American Beauty""), particularly in a novel. I'll be generous and give it four stars, but there are other novels I'd recommend ahead of this one."
5,"Loved It, Loved It, Loved It!!","Excellent! A wonderfully written story involving different generations, great characters, funny, romantic, refreshing, and shows that love can happen at any age. The writer who was also the narrator did a beautiful job. I honestly did not want the story to end! Can't wait to hear her next book! Danielle Steel, (whom I love), LOOK OUT!!"
5,Charming Romance,"A lovely, funny, and thoroughly enjoyable little story about a middle aged woman and middle aged man with grown children from separate marriages who fall in love. let the family wars begin!!"
4,cute story,It was refreshing to read a story about older lovers! An original twist on the old story.
4,Fun read,"This author is so funny, any woman will love these books if you have had a family and lived a few years of life. Enjoy!!!"
4,Romance is Sweet--Prejudice is Bitter,"This is a plausible, sweet, difficult, and humorous romance of two 60 year olds. Until the end of the book, the reader wonders why in the world the Roseman and Cacciamani families have this 2+ generation feud going on. The Want-To-Be Lovers, Julie and Romeo, are the only ones that seem to care to end the years of hate. The children don't know why the families hate each other but want to continue the battle with the energy of the next generation. I had no idea that florists could be so unkind to each other!I liked the romance between Julie Roseman and Romeo Cacciamani that reminds us that love is not just for the young. But the deeper question raised by the author centers around the rationality of long held prejudice."
4,Different Perspective,"An older characters perspective on love, family and business and not much different from the younger generation's perspectives."
3,Very light read.,"Although I enjoyed the story, I was a bit disappointed. It lacked depth of characters. It didn't help that I just finished Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice so perhaps I was expecting a lot. I would recommend it to someone who wants to read a book in a day or two. It was a sweet story but I wanted MORE."
4,A Lovely Read,If you like romance then this is the book for you. If you like your heroes to be in the early part of their lives with bodies like Greek Gods then stay away.This is a sensitive and some times funny look at two sixty-year-old people falling in love.Julie and Romeo each own a floundering florist business and due to divorce and death are now single.All the odds are against their romance from the start. For as long as they can remember their families have hated each other; none of them knowing the reason why.Not wishing to upset their children they court each other in secret. The results of which are tender and cheerful.This book was an enjoyable read and one that is absolutely believable.
5,IS THIS GOOD OR WHAT!!!,This is some of Bob's best work yet!! How dose this low tech kinda guy keep puttin' out such good stuff!! Great footage of historic Yorktown and colonial Jamestown. I liked it so much that I just had to go there and see it for myself this year for our vacation. Biked the whole Colonial Parkway all thanks to the great DVD put together by this man!! THANK YOU BOB!!!
1,Fanciful,"As more scholarly reviewers have already pointed out, the author has done little more than propose a novel theory and then scour the historical record to prop up her suppositions. An example that sticks in my head is when Winn theorizes that mosquitoes may have been the disease bearers. Her reasoning runs: the Salem girls were mostly affected, right? And girls work in the garden, where there are mosquitoes, and girls do chores in the dawn and dusk, when mosquitoes are active. Uhhh...did Puritan men ever get out of the kitchen in Winn's world? Then a page later, she announces that it could have been ticks. After all, men went out into the woods and cut tick-infested lumber for firewood (conveniently not getting bitten). The lumber was then placed in homes where the girls lived, and, well, you do the math. It just doesn't add up to anything more than a fanciful ""say, what if?....nah."""
4,Comments from a survivor of encephalitis,"I happened to appreciate the author's view of what witchcraft really may have been. As a survivor of encephalitis (HSE), I know first hand that your personality changes overnight (or, right after you wake up). Most doctors today can't diagnose encephalitis so I can just imagine what brain-damaged people must have been perceived as back then. Than you for opening others' eyes."
4,Reasonable Purchase,"The product arrived on time and in good shape. It has reasonable tone, accurate intonation, and acceptably finished. The tuning machines work acceptably and hold the tune after the strings have been stretched for awhile. I bought it for my grandaughter to begin learning chords on and it was worth the purchase price."
2,no hard case - disappointed,just got my and disappointed as soon as I opened the shipping box. there is no hard case to for carrying it around. the dewalt finish and brad nailers came with the hard cases. I would NOT buy this frame nailer had I read it thoroughly and recognize it doesn't come with the hard case. Didn't ship with 1 oz oil as stated
4,Entertaining enough to keep watching.,"I won't pretend like this show isn't a naked cash grab for the Mad Men audience. I'd be an idiot to assume otherwise. It shouldn't be counted out simply based on that though. It's a pretty entertaining show so far. Production values are high, the pace is breezy, and there's some really good character writing/acting here. Yeah, some of the dialogue and ""girl power"" aspects of it are a little on the nose, but I didn't expect anything less from Mad Men dumbed down for network.Don't count this one yet, there might be something to see in those friendly skies."
4,Great Show,I try not to compare shows from one to the next but I've enjoyed the first 9 episodes so far. The plots can be a bit far-fetched but its entertaining none the less.
4,Not the best episode from the show but pretty good,"I'm a big fan of this show. Its really too bad it struggled so much. This wasn't the best episode of the season, but it did a good job of setting up the next one, 1964. Don't try to watch it without context though: you'll just get lost."
5,Excellent,"Love this series, and each episode gets better and better. The characters are engaging and the plots exciting, it's a refreshing chance of tv and an interesting look back on life in the sixties."
4,Free is always at least an ok watch,"Got the first 9 episodes free from amazon. I work for an airline, and of course nearly all you see on here isn't what really happens(though back during the time period this is for some of it is true). Its a pretty boring series for me, and the wifi at work isn't fast or reliable enough to watch. But from what I've seen at home, these flight attendants are way cuter and thinner than the majority that I see lol. I think for sure I would love my job far more if it were during this time period, and may even have a similar pay rate...which back then would be great!Now for this episode, story was ok. The food they were serving for first class pax was the most interesting to me lol."
3,"Good Series, but lacking something","I was really curious about this show so when I had the opportunity to grab the first season on a deal I did.It is interesting, I like the characters, and I like the interactions and episodes. I would say it is a good show. However I did get bored after about 8 episodes or so, and felt it was going nowhere (or at least really slow to wherever it was going).But kudos to them for the look and feel of the show, which is something they could have done poorly."
5,Loved this show,"It may be copying Mad Men, but I loved it! This is what the 60's was really like. I worked in advertising in the 60's and lived the Mad Men life, but I knew girls who were stewardesses and this was pretty accurate in depicting their lifestyle. Maybe embellished to make it more glamorous but that's what we expect from entertainment. Wish they had not taken it off!"
3,Bummed it wasn't renewed.,"I enjoyed watching this series on television. Not too much to think about when watching it, but fun enough that I wanted to watch the next week. I'm bummed they decided not to renew the series."
5,A TRUE CLIFFHANGER EPISODE,"THIS IS REALLY ONE OF THE BEST EPISODES SO FAR IN THE SERIES THAT JUST LEFT YOU HANGING. MAGGIE HAS AN AFFAIR WITH A HANDSOME CONGRESSMAN.KATE'S INVOLVEMENT WITH THE CIA GOES BEYOND BEING A COURIER FOR THE CIA.SHE HAS TO DELIVER A LIST TO HER BRITISH MI-5 COUNTERPART. AT STAKE IS THE FUTURE SECURITY OF NIKOS AND BRIGITTE. AT THE HOTEL SHE FINDS OUT THAT HER INVOLVEMENT IS MORE COMPLICATED. THIS LIST MUST BE SWITCHED. THE VERY END IS A NAIL BITER. AFTER MAGGIE HAS BEGUN AN AFFAIR WITH HER CONGESSMAN, SHE TRIES TO DESTROY HIS SPEECH. SHE ACCIDENTALLY SETS THE HOTEL ON FIRE!! KATE SAVES THE DAY AND THE LIFE OF THE MI-5 AGENT.AS A 1970'S INTERNATIONAL FLIGHT ATTENDANT I FIND THAT THIS SERIES IS FULL OF MYSTERY AND INTRIGUE.THIS IS THE STRONGEST EPISODE SO FAR. IF YOU LIKE THIS SERIES MAKE SURE TO GO TO PAN AM TV PETITION.COM AND ASK THAT IT BE CONTINUED."
5,When things were classic,"A new classic in the making. Take the movie, ""Catch me if you Can"", and continue the story only with the focus on the lives of the stewardess. This show takes us back to a time when men wore hats, songs had meaningful lyrics, everyone dressed up and words like noble, gentleman, and lady meant something. When Frank Sinatra (Deano, Bobby Darin, Nat King Cole) songs were still in style and people were civil to each other. The show is not only fun entertainment, but nudges one's crusty heart toward the hope of true romance and the longing for being with genuinely good people. Takes me back to my 1st job in Los Angeles CA, living at a beach front complex with a dozen Pan Am flight attendants -- heaven on legs..."
1,Worst show I have seen in a long time.....,"Previews looked good even though it seemed like it was trying to ride the Mad Men wagon. Well, if it was, total fail. I can't understand why all the good reviews for this show? Bad script along with some bad acting, made this cool concept a shadow of what could have been a great show. I love Christina Ricci, so I admit I had high hopes going in, but what a waste of her talent. With all the great TV out now (Damages, Homeland, The League, Dexter, Mad Men, Shameless, House of Lies, Boss, etc) Why would anyone bother with this show??? Skip this insepid show and save your hard earned money, as well as the many hours of your life watching this show, that you will never get back."
1,Don't Buy This,"It was a great idea. It could have been good. Mad Men in the air, right? But the plots are so ridiculous and the stereotypes so indicative of a poorly written script, I don't even blame the actors, who probably gave up their good names for participation. I bought the season, excited to watch as I love Mad Men and sixties Bond movies, and Hitchcock, but didn't even get past episode 4. Think I didn't even finish it. Truly bored. And it could have been so good. Get Nurse Jackie instead. Now there is some good writing about not much of an idea. Proving that the idea is only part of the formula. The writing, plot and characters are the test. Just skip it."
1,Spare yourself,"Someone told me this was supposed to be the female version of MadMen. No way. It's utterly inferior in every way. For a pilot to be so utterly uninspiring is preposterous, given that pilots are usually the thing which gets you hooked. it was unconvincing, not particularly interesting, and surprisingly not even that good to look at."
2,Compilation,"Perhaps I should have read the reviews a bit more carefully before I purchased this book. My interest is World War 2 first person acounts, especially those books written by aviators. Although this book was, for the most part, a first person account, it was also very repetitive as if each chapter( by the author) was a magazine article intended for a reader who had not read the previous chapter. For instance, the section of the book relating the author's personal experiences includes at least three seperate ""chapters"" wherin he describes his crash during his initial carrier qualification. This book would be more accurately described as a compilation of magazine articles that describe very specific incidents ( sometimes as many as three times) without any depth and with little context. That being said, I admire the author's courage in flying the beast that was the Corsair."
5,Wonderful,"This book is just simply wonderful. It is full of specific advice that really works. I have had really bad night time heart burn. Traditional methods only had limited success. After reading and digesting this superb book, I can only say I am a new man. I believe this will be a runaway best seller.Buy it and Reap its benefits...if you have heart burn this is the best book on the market bar none !!"
4,Good book for GERD SUFFERERS,Ive had GERD for about 20 years. Although the title is misleading meaning that it does not provide a cure all for heartburn. It does however teach you the steps for maximizing treatment and avoiding wasted time in controlling heartburn. A must have.
5,Excellent and thorough!,"This books covers it all, from what heartburn is to what you can do about it, including medications, alternative remedies (who knew ginger helped heartburn), lifestyle remedies like raising the head of your bed and much more. There's also a chapter about children with GERD, another chapter on pregnancy (when many women have heartburn) and a chapter on heartburn in the elderly. This book can't be beat---although if you buy it, YOU can beat your heartburn problem!"
2,Too basic to help me,"This book is so basic that (at least to me) it was virtually useless. There was not one shred of new information. Anyone who has had heartburn for some time and has done any investigative work will get nothing new from this book. How about some innovative, new, or experimental heartburn management strategies?"
2,outdated,This book seems to be outdated (it mentions vioxx which has since been taken off the market). I also feel that some of the information may be incorrect (it states that H Pylori may decrease the symptoms of reflux).I feel there are other better books on the market. I recommend 'No More Heartburn' by Sherry Rogers over this book.
1,Save your money & keyword heartburn on the web,"This isn't a bad book, but you can get all the same information going on line and keywording GERD or heartburn. I am sceptical of the many anecdotal patients in the book, used entirely to support her topic of the moment. I felt spoken down to in the book. Still, if you MUST have a book about this topic, this one will give you all the basics, but don't expect any revolutionary new ideas to conquer this bothersome syndrome."
5,Excellent entertainment for youngsters and oldsters alike,Great cd that fans of the show will love! Keeps kids enthralled for hours. Has easily recognizable music from the show along with talking segments from everyone's favorite teletubbies. By the way Tinky Winky is purple not blue!
1,"Very boring, slow and irritating to me and my 2yr old","I bought this video because I couldn't find any opposites flashcards. When I received the video I watched it (I watch everything before my son sees it so I know what to try to teach him). This movie is EXTREMELY boring and the narrators voice is IRRITATING. She sounds fake. I'd recommend Baby's First Impressions Opposites. The lady's voice is much more palitable and it's alittle more exciting. All of the BumbleBee Kids videos have the same narrator but for some reason THIS video is the worst. ABC's and Colors are alright (it's good to use flashcards too, to reinforce what they've learned). My son adores the numbers and I like the fact that they have 2 discs so once your kid can count upto 5 then you just go to disc 2. I could've saved my money on this video. Buyer beware!"
1,They obviously didn't even watch it themselves!,"This was a big disappointment. There is nothing on this tape that isn't on other ""opposites"" educational tapes, but there are plenty of mistakes. Shall I start with the fact that the voiceover at times does not relate to what the children are watching (for example, the voiceover says something like ""the boy is picking up the car,"" but there is no car and no little boy. You see the car and the boy much later and without the voiceover explanation. The car that drives ten feet past the stop sign before stopping -- to illustrate the word ""stop"" -- was comical. Examples abound, but need I really say more?I have purchased other products from this company in the past and found them somewhat useful (although far from great) albeit not for the age range it is targeted for. They were educational for my 9 month old baby.I wasn't the only one who didn't like it; my son (2.5 years) loses interest in no time."
2,Author needs to learn how to communicate,"I found this book to be very frustrating. Many interesting concepts, but extrememly difficult to read. It seemed like there was a new concept every paragraph, but I was still trying to figure out what the previous paragraph was trying to explain. The APA referencing was also distracting. The author referenced many sources, so just about the time I'd get a flow going in the reading I'd hit a reference that would interrupt my train of thought. Thank goodness we had an excellent teacher in the classroom who could interpret the book for us."
1,...,"... When I got this I was expecting some good music, instead it's almost as if I camped out in a Casio forest. If you would like material for history's sake then this is for you. If you want to get it to listen to, then think twice. I was [upset] after twenty seconds of listening to this CD."
2,"Don't buy the Kindle Version, get the Paperback!","I purchased the kindle version and it was not worth my money. The problem is that the table of contents breaks down the introduction into sections such as ""author, place of writing, date, etc..."" but then the actually commentary is just one section titled ""commentary"". This means that on a kindle you have no way of navigating 90% of the book. You have to click through the 200 pages of commentary one page at a time until you find the particular scripture you are looking for. Purchase the paperback version so you can easily find what you need!"
4,Good Commentary!,"This book presents a good evaluation of I Peter. However, it could probably be updated."
1,Way Overpriced!,"Go to the hardware store and buy some generic casters. $125 for four wheels? For that price you can buy four 1000lb casters. I bought four bolt on casters for $25 from Home Depot. They work just fine, and now I have $100 to put toward sandpaper for my 16/32 Sander."
3,JET 98-0130 Set of Four Casters,These lockable casters are great! Easy to install and easy to unlock and lock. They are expensive though at nearly $100. They were about $20 cheaper when I purchased mine.
5,Easy Glide!,If your in the market for locking casters for easy operation of wood working machines these fuction very well on carpet or concrete flooring. They got my vote!
2,i've seen better,"After reading the other reviews I realize that I am lucky in that this player did not start displaying ""no disk"" until a year and a half down the road (with light use). it is very temperamental and chooses when it is in the mood to play a cd. no complaints with the radio or cassette player, but if you are in the market for a cd player.. keep looking. you can do better."
1,Poor Quality,"When we purchased this for my daughter, a year and a half ago, there were no reviews for it (ours is actually the Sony CFD-S300 which is no longer offered). I thought Sony was a reliable name brand and that is why I purchased it without any feedback listed...bad mistake.As everyone else here has written, the disc player no longer works. It was great for a little while, then tempermental for a few months and now it is done for good. The cassette player still works and I use it for books on tape, but it's no good for anything my kids have.I'm not sure what I'll buy to replace it but I will certainly do a little more research this time!"
5,Creative Children will do interesting things!,"I work at a College in the Englsih department so I'm always on the lookout for intersting books that can be used in classes. I found ""To Love Mercy"" a very interesting read. I really enjoyed the depth that Mr. Joseph went to in creating some of his characters (he talks about it in his blog on his book website). I thought that the most intersting part was how he had the two main characters bond though a negative incident that turns out to create an incredibly positive bond and growth experience for both boys. I enjoyed this book a lot."
4,Have Things Really Changed Much?,It's a book set in a US city (Chicago) in the forties where segregation and ignorance are a way of life. It's a book about an adventure between two culturally separated boys that leaves them with an experience of empathy they will never forget. It's a book that gives the reader some hope and the realization of the importance in exposing our children to different people and experiences. A great read for teens and adults alike.
3,"wonderful message, imperfect delivery","I adore the ""Amazing Grace"" cd ( I have both versions, and still play them both regularly ). The music on this one, though, has that terribly slick, over-produced eighties sheen to it that I just can't get into. It has none of the soul that made ""Amazing Grace"" transcend all boundaries. The vocals are, as usual, incredibly moving. It's just the music itself that I don't care for. If you are a fan of newer RnB styled Gospel like Yolanda Adams and things like that, you might like this. I just found it ""samey"", much like the majority of Aretha Franklin's eighties recordings for Arista."
4,Aretha is still Aretha,"Even though she has aged and such is displayed in her voice, the Queen's ability to use experience and such vocal control is unparalleled... I can hardly wait for the next gospel recording by the Queen!!! I LOVE YOU RE-RE!!!"
3,Fair to fine,"Aretha Franklin's Amazing Grace with James Cleveland and The Southern California Community Choir is far (100 times) better. Check out this album (Amazing Grace) before buying Aretha Franklin's One Lord, One Faith, One Baptism."
4,"If you like ELECTRO, you'll love this!","I bought this cd not knowing what to expect. I was surprised to find that it contains some slamming electro tracks. Check out ""I want to Fall."" It will give your woofers a workout! Well worth it if you like electro."
1,Useless for me,"I bought this tool to detect screws in drywall and it just doesn't. It detects only the metal corner reinforcement. [Money] wasted. PLUS it requires a battery, which isn't included for some reason (after 30 years of customer disappointment you'd think batteries would always be included now). Even when you put it in the cart, the cart doesn't offer you batteries... worthless, irritating."
5,the right tool,"I purchased the Wizard II metal detector for the sole purpose of avoiding nails while cutting hard wood floors for repair.I felt that larger, more sensitive metal detectors would detect nails in the subfloor. The Wizard II was the right tool for my job. My floor repairs were completed with out contacting a single nail."
5,good tool,"This tool is not fool proof, but it does what it is supposed to do, which is beep when metal is nearby. I can find no purpose for the line of red lights. The only thing they seem to do is tell you that the buzzer has stopped buzzing when you are adjusting the sensitivity level. So a hearing impaired person could adjust the buzzer, but not use the tool, since the lights do not come on when metal is detected. But this is just one of those ""what the hell did they do that for"" questions. The unit detects metal even when it's 2"" deep in hard wood, so it's great."
2,Not great for meat.....,"I purchased this item from a main sportsmen store to check for steel/shot in wild game. It does find metal but only 1/4"" deep. Any deeper and it won't find steel shot. This leaves a lot of meat unchecked unless you slice 1/4"" pieces.It probably has to due to the size of metal or maybe the density of meat. Seems to work for other people working w/ wood seaching for larger pieces of metal."
2,Finds large screws/nails in wood but not small ones,"Tested it out on an 8' long old birch-top workbench. Unit found the screws holding 3/4"" top to the frame. It also found most of the visible nails that had been pounded into the top over the years. The key word is ""most"". It could not find a finishing nail embedded in the top corner of the front edge of the top. I could see the nail with the naked eye but this unit didn't know it was there!!I was going to return it but figured for $20 I'd keep it and use it to at least find bigger metallic objects."
4,Not for the faint of heart,This was an interesting read though a bit too scholarly at times. I am a fan of Mr. Gussows work and while I enjoyed this book I don't know if it will be everyone's cup of tea. If you have an interest in the subject matter I do recommend this to you as there is nothing else out there quite like it.
2,"Ambitious thesis, disappointing results","Adam starts out with a very difficult to support thesis, that bogs down in incredable academic leaps of faith. Not only does he not provide adequately provide support for the theme of his book; he almost abandons trying to half way through. The chapter focusing on Mamie Smith's ""Crazy Blues"" was refreshing and eye opening, but the rest of the book does not sway one to ackowledge the validity of his point. The constant use of ""Blues Literature"" to support his theory of real worl dblue falls short by nature, being that the blues authors quoted wrote fiction where is by its essence prone to exagerationa nd romanticism and can not convincingly back up his point about white oppression and violence being the backbone of almost all blues music and acting as a coded message universally gotten by the black blues audience. The academic nature of this book loses touch with the reality of things."
2,so so album,"i personally dont like the giving stars option,but have to.The album was good. However I belive that Indian classical music is not meant to be played in duets. Shujjhat khan has mentioned this, in the booklet.Tejendra Majumdar Is a amazing player, and Shujjhat is a good player. But both of them would have played more freely and naturally if they played solo. this seems very rehearsed."
1,Om Shanti,"This album was a dissapointing. The redeeming fact was Tejendra Narayans sarode. shujjhat khans sitar dosent come close I really enjoyed the classical depth of Tejendra Narayan. My personal opinion is Indian classical music is a very deep and intricate art,its not about OMs and Shantis. if one seeking that then they should look in the bhajan section. The same is to say about singing gazals while performing. A great album to look out for is Tejendra Majumdar's Kafi Kannada which can be obtained by Amazon"
2,herr voidness,ha ha this is hilarious. ok this album is not worth creating such a controversy. we have a wannabe scottish royale a new age buff from nocal and a couple of indian music critics and a bengali musicologist fighting over a small album. its just not worth it. its not good or bad its average. lets not put it down or overrate it.If you guys have a life you wouldnt be spending so much time writing thesis's on Amazon. you guys call people you dont even know imposters: are you back in second grade??cmon enjoy the day and move on
1,return,Im actually new to Indian classical music. I brought a few other albums alongwith this one they were of Vishwa Mohan Bhatt and Hari Prasad Chaurasia which I thought were amazing. But as far as this album is concerned I just didnt enjoy it.sorry
3,And by the way...,"...I wasn't the one who used the word, ""Shanti,"" in my first review, but since YOU mentioned it, Shanti (peace) is one of the nine ""rasas,"" i.e. moods, described in Indian classical music theory...so apparently this music isn't too ""deep"" or ""intricate"" to evoke such a mood. Try knowing a little something about what you are writing about, before you write about it."
5,I love this album!,"I don't know much about Indian music but a friend recommended this one to me...and I LOVE it. It is so melodic and sparkling, the way the two great musicians interweave the melodies and trade back and forth. It's maybe the best interplay I've ever heard in a concert. Beautiful!I can't understand why one guy here keeps giving this album one star. Maybe there's some kind of ethnic prejudice going on. I can see if it's not your cup of tea how you might give it three or maybe even two stars...but this is a really great concert, and these two musicians really PLAY! You should only give one star for really AWFUL stuff, and this DEFINITELY ISN'T awful. Don't let someone's personal or ethnic prejudice prevent you from discovering this beautiful music."
3,Excuse me?!,"Because someone uses the word, ""om,"" in a review, doesn't mean that person doesn't understand and appreciate the ""depth"" and ""intricacies"" of Indian classical music! Have you heard of ""light classical"" music, btw, Washington reviewer? How many times and ways does one have to say, ""Keep your regional/ethnic snobbery to yourself, and out of reviews."" Let's not let Amazon reviews become a forum for ignorance and prejudice, under the guise of ""personal opinion."" The world could use a little more ""shanti,"" btw."
4,Real Good Movie Play!,"I really enjoyed this movie it was far from a play. It was funny and truth is this could happen to anybody who's dealing with relationships, internet, love, life kids etc...! Watch it and enjoy!"
3,"Reasonable price, but a bit awkward","This is a decent price for a dual track and the track has a decent design.As noted by one of the other reviewers, the scale is in segments. There are marks to line up the segments hopefully without creating measurement error, but this will be much more cumbersome than if the scale moved as a single unit."
4,Enter Planet Chemical,Proof that techno can have soul. This is as much of a rock CD as it is elecronica. If this can't get your energy up see a doctor now!
4,One for you're collection,If you're into experimental music then you surely have heard of the Chemical Brothers. As a debut it has its highs and lows but shows true potential to what they would later create. My two personal favourite tracks which make this a must have in any electronica fanatic's collection is ' Chico's Groove' and ' One Too Many Mornings ' which are true gems unto themselves. This might not be they're best album but its held up over the years as one of the best debut electronic albums.
4,never wanted to be either of those,"I enjoy EXIT PLANET DUST by the Chemical Brothers. It is their usual brand of exceptional block rock'n beats (e.g. LEAVE HOME & 3 LITTLE ...) and ethereal trance inducing dance numbres. My favourite song is ALIVE ALONE in which Beth Orton sings her special siren serenade. ONE TOO MANY MORNINGS falls into the same category. I feel light and the world feels right when I listen to Ms Orton backed by the hypnotising beat of the Brothers. Together the fast and slow song make for a bit of diversity in the CD which is refreshing. If you are interested in block rock'n beats and spacey, psychedelia, this CD will interest you."
5,Awesooooommmmmeeee!,Just forget everything anyone says adversely of this cd. This HAS to rank as one of the best techno cd's ever to be made! Anyone that says otherwise has absolutely NO taste in good music
2,Where's the hooks?,"This album plays like a The Crystal Method album but without the hooks. I did not get attached to any of the melodies which doesn't reflect the beats very well, nor the bass lines. The sample work was splendid, however, which has me on a fence whether or not I should continue to buy.Overall, though, a boring listen. I'd probably enjoy it at a local occasion but not for personal use.I purchased this album because I wanted to be introduced to The Chemical Brothers the right way, through their first releases.I've heard somewhere that each album progresses in a different and often more appealing direction so I won't let this album ruin The Chemical Brothers for me. I see potential in their work in Exit Planet Dust. Excellent sample work. I plan to buy another album. I'm a bit interested to see where it might go."
4,Nice one,"Their debut is not their best CD but it shows what was to come. Cool is ""Life is sweet"" and simply wonderful ""Alive alone"". The best track is ""Three little birdies down beats"". The Chemical Brothers are one of the very few techno-bands who do their job with a twinkling humor. Enjoy!"
5,one of my all time favorites,"I have had ""Exit Planet Dust"" for a few years now and it is still alive and kickin' in my cd player. I think it is probably my favorite big beat album ever. I'm listening to it right now and the bass just dropped on chemical beats and I am sitting here with this album I have heard hundreds of times thinking ""WOW"". Big funky basslines, sirens, chunky synthesizer and guitar riffs all powered by big percussion, how could you go wrong with that? And there is a nice slower more nostalgic one with Beth Orton to close it all down. If this isn't a perfect album it is about as close as it gets."
5,I'm sorry for what I said before,"I'm sorry I gave this CD only 3 stars. I now realize that it is a very good album. I'm also sorry for spelling techno ""tehno"". I also now realize that this is the perfect CD for people who don't generally like techno, despite what I said before about them staying far far away. I am also a big picklehead and I want you to e-mail myself and others telling them what a picklehead I am."
4,March forward!,An imaginative and interesting glimpse at what the Little Women's father was doing in the Civil War when they were home having their own adventures and growing up.
1,Disappointing,"I am not going to create a long rehashing of the novel -- but I do want to voice my feelings about the hazards of anyone other than the author creating a sequel to a well-loved book. My interpretations of the characters of Marmee and Mr. March were and are very different from those of Miss Brooks. I object to her entire concept. In her afterword, the author states that her mother told her that no one could be such a goody-goody as Marmee -- how wrong she is. I have known many people who are not saints or "" goody-goodies"" but truly try to live the best lives possible and succeed admirably. Instead of tampereing with characters who are well-loved from a book that many hold dear, why does the author not creat her own story about the Civil War era and not try to capture a ready-made audience of another author?"
2,This isn't The Year of Wonders,"I read The Year of Wonders and loved it. I bought this book specifically because it's the same author, and with high hopes. Unfortunately, this book is boring and slow moving. It could not hold my attention at all, and I didn't get engrossed with the characters like in her other book. I would not recommend this book."
5,March,This book arrived the estimated date. It was gently used like appeared on the website.Lois A. Bennett
3,Evocative,"Offers a sense of the time and place, but the contrivance of its relationship to Alcott's classic seems unnecessary. Still, this is an author who can set a stage."
2,messy book,"Of course, all the words were there, so it served its purpose as a book club choice. However, I was quite disappointed in the condition of the book. Many pages were turned down or wrinkled and a great many had underlinings -- many times through the words that were being underlined, and many pages had comments in the edges. It's the first time I've purchased a book though Amazon that was not 100%."
5,Beautifully written Civil War novel,"March is one of the most interesting and enjoyable books that I have read this year. It is beautifully written. Although the character, March, is from the book, Little Women, which I read when I was a child and don't remember much about, it's really a story of one man's experiences and his feelings during the Civil War. You don't need to read Little Women to enjoy this story. I am starting to read Ms. Brooks' book entitled, Year of Wonders, because I loved March so much and enjoy her writing style. I look forward to seeing more books by this author."
1,Disappointed,"Couldn't get into the plot; was very slow-paced and depressing. I was bummed I had to give up on it, but wasn't going to waste my time."
3,"dark, interesting and well written","March is a great book, but it definitely leans toward the modern ideology that there are no true heroes, and search as hard as you can you will find no person in this book that is a hero. At some points you will think you have, but you haven't.If reading that has made you somewhat depressed, this book will do that for around 300 pages. It is well written, but too dark, to gray and not very much light. It is a good read, but not great."
2,march,"Since I'm not a Civil War enthusiast and didn't really like the person, Mr. March, I didn't enjoy this book much."
4,good Civil War book,"good read - you should read or reread ""Little Women"" first. I did. I think it really enhanced my read. Also read ""'Transcendental Wild Oats"" by LMA."
5,A Pulitzer is not enough,"This is a wonderful story. The hook, of course, is that it is about Mr. March (Alcott) and what he is doing while he is away during the course of the story told in Little Women. But that trivializes this wonderful, gripping, rending, engrossing story. There is much more here than ever there was in Alcott's book (as good as it was) and this book goes well beyond its device to deliver wonderful insight into the human condition, the complexities of war, the horror of slavery, the failings of idealism and much more.Very highly recommended."
2,Disappointing..,I liked People of the Book (yet it did have some slow parts) and I did like the beginning chapters of this book but I had to stop in the middle and just skip over the last 100 pages or so. It became pretty boring to me despite the interesting backdrop of a war.
4,March....the other story,"March took me into the American Civil war through the eyes of the father of the famous 'little women', showing how the reality of war affects the northern idealists."
4,March,"March is written in old american, I find the language fun, and like looking up the meanings on the dictionary.Story construction is interesting.Civil war in america was an interesting time.The way people can be so cruel to each other is saddening, but looking at recent history, this facet of human behavour has not altered much."
3,March Review,"Enjoyed this read, followed on from Little Women very smoothly. As an avid Historical Romance reader this book proved to be one worth reading."
3,Perspective,Little Women's dad is just an illusion on a pedestal before reading this book. It also offers great insights into the mom's personality and their relationship as a couple. Well done!
3,interesting,"The author did a great job of capturing the ""voice"" of a Civil War soldier and some of the brutality of the times. But without a recent trip to Gettysburg, I don't think I would have appreciated it as much, nor would I have been able to visualize it too well. It's definitely not for everyone but try it, you may like it."
2,Ho-hum,"I'm very drawn to the trancendental period of American history and literature. Emerson, Thoreau and Dickenson are deep, original, and magical philosophers, poets and thinkers. I go back to them for inspiration and to glimpse the seed of how America could have evolved. The civil war and slavery was the dark side of that era. I looked forward to this book to provide some insights to reconcile the odd dichotomy of those times.The author followed the marketable and easily exploitable portrayal of the inhumanity of slavery. Ho-hum. Could have been any time, any place. It was not particularly insightful of the period. The author is an adept, but not evocative writer."
3,Frustrating and dissatisfying,"I agree that the novel starts out slow, and even through my frustration I stuck it out (fortunately it's a pretty short book). Still, I was rarely able to forget the novel's failures, even when the plot kept me going. I admit that my affectionate (though not passionate) memories of Little Women made me resistant to Brooks' alternate perspective, but I also felt like the references to Alcott's text made this book a little clumsy-- March referring to his ""little women"" frequently, Marmee hoping for artistic daughters. And Brooks doesn't escape the historical-novel hitch of bogging her readers down with incongruent language. Between those two issues, I felt frequently distracted by the contrivance and wished that the novel had foregone the frame story altogether."
4,Calling all Little Women fans!,"I LOVED Little Women growing up, and I loved this book too.It was interesting to learn the story from Mr. March's point-of-view, including the inclusion of Thoreau, Emerson, and Brown. It was intriguing to read of he and Marmee as abolitionists and their involvement in the Underground Railroad.I did have a few issues with parts of the book, but overall it was a delight."
2,Just ok,I just lost interest. But I don't really like books written in the first person.Also I don't understand how one author can piggy back off of another author's book.
4,Well written and inventive,Well written envisioning of March's adventures pre and during family life in Concord. Enjoyable read anyone could enjoy. I recommend it!
5,Good Stuff,"The writing was wonderful, and very descriptive. I was totally immersed in the story and although some scenes were quite graphic, I found it a powerful and compelling story. It was also a quick read. I enjoyed so much I will probably read again."
4,A Historical Fantasy (Civil War) with Moral Dilemna,"This book is the author's fantasy version of the life and times of Peter March, father of the ""Little Women."" You may recall that in ""Little Women"" the father is absent. Well, this book weaves a tale of where he's been.Mr. March, a non-denominational pastor, goes off to war to help the fighting boys of the North. Mr. March has no intention of engaging in fighting, but rather to provide spiritual support to the troops. However, he finds that in war it's not possible to stay out of the conflict.As an abolishonist, Peter March firmly believes in the North's cause. Throughout this story he is meeting, hiding, befriending, and teaching slaves and former slaves. His engagement in the Civil War is exhausting physicially and emotionally. It even makes him begin to doubt his faith.I highly recommend this book. It's not ""The Year of Wonders,"" but it's still a good read."
2,It is really a long March...,"I have been reading this book forever. I never quit a book in the middle but press on and this one is like a ""march that will not end"".Not my cup of tea."
1,March could have been so much more.,"Geraldine Brooks has a masterful command of language, however I felt she needed to focus on violent shock-value to keep the reader's interest. I was also irritated with how the protagonist was presented. In the story Mr. March is supposed to be a religious person and while he is gentle and kind, he lacks the spirit of God -- he also lacks integrity in keeping the seventh commandment. The author may have researched about religious people but it seemed obvious to me that she isn't religious herself and therefore Mr. March lacked the depth that comes from knowing God. The last chapter is the only chapter one needs to read in order understand the theme of the narrative. Novels focusing on this difficult time in our history that are truely moving and enlightening would include Uncle Tom's Cabin, Red Badge of Courage and Fire by Night but not March."
1,"trite, shallow and irrelevant","If you want to read something that is mostly Forrest Gump meets the Civil War, read this. But if you would rather read something that actually says something deep and meaningful about living in wartime skip this book. And if you might be hooked into thinking it has anything to do with Little Women other than a connection by name....well think again. Ugh! Couldn't get through it. Tried hard."
3,Predictable,"This book burns idealism in effigy by giving us a flawed idealist and attempting to use him to disprove the concept of believing in something greater than self-preservation and the ""obvious"" emotions of loving family, neighbors, etc. It spoon-feeds us easily digestible lines about the nature of human hubris and the vast destruction of war, but it's about as subtle as a soap opera and has the same kind of greeting-card sympathies. Because it takes on ""big topics"" and makes them accessible to even the simplest among us, it is undoubtedly a favorite among the book critics, but anyone accustomed to real literature will find it becomes empty because it fills us with the junk food of ideas: they seem profound but when analyzed are simplistic and leave us no hope for anything but sitting and watching television, waiting for the world to change."
4,solid read,"Interesting. Our 15 year old daughter seemed to like it, but was pretty graphic sometimes."
2,March,I read the book for a book club... It was very provative and I would not have chosen it on my own....
3,Books on CD are great; March is not!,"I do like to listen to books on CD. If one is driving alone, it makes the time go faster.When I started listening to this story, the first thing that confused me was why a story about the Civil War and the March family (Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy of Little Women fame) was being read by someone British. If British equals erudite by the producers of the book on CD and perhaps the author, they are misguided. The quality of the CD and the packaging was very nice but then there was the story. It's about the little women's father. The author attempts Alcott's style and falls distressingly short. The story itself has a lot of holes and is pretty contrived. I wish I had brought another book on CD from Amazon instead of wasting my money on this one."
2,solid but not particularly memorable,"I was shocked when March won the Pulitzer Prize. Geraldine Brooks is a well-spoken storyteller in her own steady way, but this is no masterpiece. Average, average, average-certainly not up to the standards of quality implied by the Pulitzer."
2,grossly overrrated,"Another trite, hackneyed, highly regarded Civil War book---similar to The March, Known World--all three overrated. Good enough reads, nothing great about them. Don't know why this book got such raves. Character of March is not heroic or admirable in the least."
4,March Involved a Revisit to Little Women,"A provocative work that caused me to revisit Little Women, a book that I loved in my childhood. The connections betwwen the two works became clear, and I loved how Brooks developed them. My only disappointed was not with March, but with Little Women. The charm that I recalled the book had, with the perspective of adulthood, turned to saccharine. Perhaps it still appeals to the young, but it is best that readers of March keep their existing memories of Little Women and not try to refresh them. It is not necessary to do so to enjoy March,"
3,a bit disappointing I'm afraid,"After ""A Year of Wonder"" I had high expectations for this book. Unfortunatly I was a bit disappointed by the lack of complexity in the story. The author did a good job tying together the theme of Little Women and this tale, I guess I was just expecting a bit more character developement and a more interesting story line. She touched on other relationships but didn't, in my opinion, develope any of them enough.Interesting, a very fast read, but not a book I'll keep around to read again."
4,Much more complex than I had imagined.,"I initially picked up this book because it won the Pulitzer and was related to Little Women, a novel I greatly enjoyed in my younger years. I did not think that it would be such a moving and complex tale of one man's attempt to reconcile his beliefs in a prejudice and war-torn country.Brooks writes impeccably of Mr. March's journeys to the south, taking on a difficult task of writing from the male perspective. She captures his commitment to both his family and the cause, a conflict that haunts him throughout the novel.I would have given the novel 4.5 stars if I could. The only thing that disappointed me was the somewhat abrupt ending. It was appropriate to the novel, but I felt myself wanting more. I understand why Brooks ended this way; she is trying to leave the reader in ""the same place"" as Mr. March. Nonetheless, the selfish reader in me wanted to hear more of the story. Perhaps it should have a 5 star rating after all."
3,Some tough reading,"I feel like you have to really be up for reading about atrocities if you're going to get through this book. I like the basic premise but as a mother with young kids, certain passages were almost unreadable, emotionally."
5,delicious writing,"A lovely novel, albeit somewhat depressing. But war is hell. Meshes wonderfully with Little Women and is hard to put down once into it."
3,not a completed read,"Didn't finish read the book.Story line was okay, interesting, yet the writer is very wordy....got me bored.maybe I'll finish it someday."
5,Great and Prompt,I was extremely pleased with this vendor. I received my book in less than 5 days from ordering it and it was in GREAT condition. I will definitely order from them again.
5,"a ""must"" for fans of Little Women","I read Little Women several times growing up and always loved it.Now comes the ""back story"" of ""Father"", who is away fighting in the Civil War.I loved the way the author fleshed out the characters of Father and Marmee, and wove in details about famous people of the time, including Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, and John Brown. The details of the Civil War were horrific but fascinating."
1,DIAMAX is NOT Crystal -- Contradictory Product Description,"Although they look similar to my other Longchamp stuff that I bought years ago I am rating them one star because the product description here claims these glasses are 24% lead crystal. The box they arrived in, however, clearly stated they were NOT lead crystal. According to the manufacturer Diamax is a ""revolutionary lead-free glass."" You will find these glasses to be lighter weight than the lead crystal Longchamp glasses you may have purchased in the past. And instead of making the melodious ring of crystal these imitations produce a dull thud."
1,disappointed,I was sent glass-not lead crystal by Beall's and now have to return on my dime-very unhappy. I would like to call them but have no phn#. Thanks for nothing!
2,not leaded crystal; Diamax means glass,Not the product we have come to know over the years from Cristal D'Arques. End of an era.Be careful with vendors offering D'Arques products as they are probably glass
2,Tiny! Tiny! Tiny!,The descriptions of this crystal is so confusing. I ordered these thinking they would be about the size of an orange juice glass-6 to 8 oz. NO--they are the cutest little toothpick holders I have ever seen! But I didn't know how you would serve a drink in them. My daughter suggested that if I was serving Irish coffee I could use these to put the liqeur in on the side so guests could use as much as they like in their coffee. That is such a better idea than tooth pick holders at each place setting :) I have also figured out that the company measures the ounces the glass will hold at just under the lip of the glass. So if you fill a glass to the lip and pour it into a measuring cup the size the company lists is about 1/2 an ounce less.
1,Poor packaging,These glasses were packed loose inside a large box and arrived broken. Luckily Amazon has a no fuss return policy.
2,gorgeous!,"gorgeous. but NOT for dish washers and NOT for every day use... very brittle after a year and very delicate, i dont have one of these left after a year.. they were a lovely idea though..."
4,Cristal D'Arques,"Received my first set of these glasses more than 20 years ago -- they look a little shabby these days from the dishwasher. Wanted to replace them and delighted to find them out in the cyber market. While they seem to be the same as my old glasses there is something different that I can't quite put my finger on. The box is definitely different but I'm not sure if they are smaller, lighter but whatever it is only my Spidey senses pick it up. They certainly were less costly buying them this way than replacing them through a replacements store. Received them quickly from the vendor and overall I'm very happy with my purchase."
2,Very basic; disappointing.,"If you have ""The Picture History of the Cunard Line"", you basically already have this book. Very little new and, quite frankly, very little at all. Limited text with numerous pages and pictures of Cunard liners with a small focus on the actual topic: the Queen Mary (1936) & Queen Elizabeth (1940). Other than an interesting and touching forward, there are no personal rememberances from crew or passenger, and unlike prior works, seemingly little research other than what has already gone before.Not bad as a general 'picture history', but falls quite short regarding the Queens themselves. If you have Bill Miller's other, earlier Dover publications, you don't need this one."
4,Plenty of old black & whites pictures with a nice amount of background info,"Picture History of the Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth is a 116 pg picture book featuring 1-3 black & white photos on each page, along with some background info about the pictures. Although the title features the two main ""Queens"", this book also covers many of the lesser known vessels during the early to middle parts of the 20th century.The last chapter even covers the Queen Elizabeth 2 and the Queen Mary 2. The image quality of each picture is mostly okay(a few are kind of grainy). And it would've been nice if the book had also covered the Queen Mary during it's stay at Long Beach(there's only a brief mention). But overall the book does feature a wide array of images with a nice amount of background info on these old-time vessels."
1,"old technology, not worth the price","This is 32 MB. THIRTY TWO. If you buy this, you are insane. You can probably find this elsewhere for a tenth of the price. It's outdated technology, and I'm suprised it hasn't been removed from this website (or had it's price significantly lowered)"
2,WTF,"I bought this product and it was delivered with speed to my house, however the cheap plastic tabs that hold the front of it together broke apart as i was setting it up.... WITH NO EFFORT! not really pleased about this."
1,"Cheap plastic, breaks easily","I had the same experience as the other reviewer, Xavier. The cheap plastic clips that hold the front hinged hood broke off with little effort."
4,Miss Lange is just great!,"For me, living in Scandinavia in a very different time, this piece should be indifferent to me(sorry for the bad grammar). BUT it is not! It is fascinating to me: the story, the characters, the beautiful landscape, and last but not least the GREAT acting going on on the screen!It's about love for your country, for your family, and for the community. It's about failure, love, finding a way in the darkest hour.If you are a fan of good drama and want to see good acting, you should definitely watch this piece."
2,I purchase this movie for my Mom,I do not like movies like this. However my Mom says it is a 5 star movie but I do not see it.
2,"Nice Italian stuff, little else to offer","The one thing I most wish I had known before buying this CD is that the reader performs all the dialogue in a sort of Transylvanian accent...I kept waiting for the Inspector to say ""I vant to sahk your blahd."" Even having the characters speak with a real Italian accent would be a dumb idea, since we're supposed to imagine that they're speaking perfect Italian (or Venetian, on occasion), not broken English. The Dracula accent is just really annoying.For the rest, Ms. Leon seems to have some familiarity with Italian culture, and that's nice, though personally I wish that she had spent more time devising an engaging plot and characters, and less on the proper wine to have with your spaghetti alle vongole. Che delusione!"
1,"Through a Glass, Darkly",This book did not meet the expections I have had with Ms. Leons previous books. Disappointed in a book that has no conclusion.
3,Good but has been better,Donna Leon always writes a good yarn. Her books are interesting in the fact she uses locations as part of the story. This latest one is not quite up to the standards of the earlier books but good nevertheless.
4,Brunetti does it again,"I've gotten hooked on this series and know, if I was familiar with the locale, I would enjoy even more. I have friends who travel frequently to Italy and they love reading about the locations they're familiar with. Leon always has intricate twists and this one was no exception while we learned interesting things about the glass industry. Like any series, once you get to the 2nd one and know the characters, it's even more interesting. It is not necessary to read the books in order. They are each independent of the others."
4,"Enjoyable, but not her best.","I love the character of Brunetti, his relationship with his co-workers and family and his love of his city. Leon does an excellent job of making the reader part of the environment. However, this was not the strongest book in the series. It seemed to get off to a very slow start and took awhile before I really felt involved. This is such a good series, but every author is allowed a slightly off book. It certainly won't prevent me from continuing the series."
4,Another enjoyable Venetian adventure,"Once again, Donna Leon brings us to Venice. This time to enjoy the nuances of Murano. I found the book absorbing with Brunetti slowly making sense out of the case as well as sharing his family with us in helping to solve the mystery. I would recommend it to others who enjoy a travelogue along with their crime."
1,A social and political polemic not a mystery,"Let me start out by saying I have been a huge fan of the Commissario Brunetti mystery series. The earlier works by Ms. Leon have been excellent mysteries and police procedurals with outstanding character development and very good plotting. Her latest works, however, are less about good mystery writing and more about a platform for her political and social views. This latest, and the last few, have been huge disappointments. Hard as it may be for her to believe, I am NOT interested in her opinions on a host of what she considers social and political issues (notwithstanding that I am in agreement with some of them!). If she wants to speak on these subjects, write letters to the editor or opinion pieces in a host of appropriate journals. I very much wish she would get back to her original roots and write more Brunetti books like the first few she penned."
4,Deadly glass,"Inspector Vianello asks his boss, Commissario Brunetti to help him obtain the release of one of his friends who was arrested at a demonstration protesting the chemical pollution of the canals of Venice. This leads them into the investigation of the murder of a worker at a glass blowing factory in Murano, the world famous home of the glass blowing industry. The main culprit seems likely to be the owner of one of the factories, a choleric old man who is convinced that his old ways of getting rid of the residue of his business isn't harmful to anyone and who refuses to bend to any new, environmentally friendly rules. What follows is a story of greed, lust for political power and one of Donna Leon's usual great reads about the exploits of the Venetian police officer, Commissario Brunetti and the every day life of the people of Venice."
4,Through a Glass Darkly,Lovely little mystery. This takes place in Venice and involves the glass blowing business.. While I was reading it I was transported to Italy...the food and culture were made real. Loved the characters and the mystery kept me thinking. Definitely recommend this book. I will read others by Donna Leon
3,"Exotic location, but too predictable","Andrew Quentin goes to visit the daughter of a famous composer and arrives just in time to prevent her from being murdered by her jealous husband. Unfortunately, the husband turns up dead later. Andrew gets involved with the beautiful widow, Tina, while he investigates the death of Tina's father the composer. They go from Florence, Italy to the Lake District in England to London. All a lot of fun, but the plot was a little thin and too predictable. It's obvious all along that Tina has a secret, and it was also obvious just what that secret was."
4,A classic fairytale :,"If you are a loyal reader of classic fairy tales filled with extraordinary characters, such as princes, kings, elfins, unicorns, fairies and wizards, and magical gadgets you will probably love Caleng and the Moonstone Pearl. A story about courage, friendship, love, innocence and occasional foolishness that occurred in a land far, far away yet so close to heart. Once again, the friendship between fairies and humans was reconciled and celebrated after a ""magical"" incident that only happened in the land of the fairies.This is Maria Romero's first children's novel yet she has shown her genuine qualities as a master writer. The details of Caleng's adventurous journey to the Moonstone Pearl are breathtaking. The dialogues are so real. I'd love to see this work adapted into a movie. It would probably become a blockbuster.Until then, perhaps Ms. Romero can continue the story and satisfies the readers' curiosity about how the stone got into the hands of grandpa Ermine.[]"
2,Supports shown but not included,I bought this replacement part especially for the two meetal supports shown in the drawing. Be advised that they are not included!!!
1,Disgrace for a released CD,"Bad picture to go along with a bad recording. Live recordingis one thing, but when you hear people talking in thebackground like the song fame (preparation for an introduction),this is a disgrace. Who authorize for something like this andrelease it as double gold.This is a live recording at it's worst. Very disapointed to ownone ordered from Amazon."
2,Got broken items,"I ordered four boxes of this item and 3 boxes with 9 glasses were broken. I ordered some flatware together with this order and apparently, Amazon, failed to take the necessary precautions to ensure that none of the glasses gets broken during shipping. They should have shipped it separately from the rest. All nine glasses had the stems broken from the goblets. The glasses are very nice but it's just too much hassle to contact Amazon for replacements or refunds."
4,Nice Glasses,"These are very nice glasses; the size I expected, quite heavy, obviously intended for durability and everyday use. However -- I'm not sure why the product description calls them ""24% lead crystal"". They're not crystal at all, except in their pattern, perhaps. These are glass. Very nice, useful glass but certainly not crystal. Anyway, for the price and the function, they're completely acceptable."
2,Need size,"Crystal D'Arques Longchamp Wine glass has10.25oz, 8.25oz,5.75oz, 4oz, 2oz, 5 different size.They are all look a like and can't tell by picture.I'm looking for my missing set of 5.75oz.I can't buy them without size information.* Edited and addedNow they shows size.FYISize 5-3/4 is 6.5"" tall and 2.5"" dia (both top dia. and bottom dia.)By the way, we see same glasses in many movies.When my wife and I see same glass in movie, we always say ""Hey, they use same glass as ours""."
5,Cristal D'Arques Longchamp Goblets,I needed replacements for my set of 24 goblets. They match my existing goblets perfectly.
2,Poor quality control,"I had to return two jointers because of serious warpsin the bed (on the infeed side near the cutting blades).After MANY phone calls, and many hours of waiting fortrucks to deliver and pick up (for example, they tellyou the truck will arive between 9:00am and 11:00am, butit doesn't arrive until 7:00pm), I finally got asatisfactory jointer about six weeks after the initialpurchase. After the first return, I asked customer serviceto please check the to make sure that the next they sentwas flat, but of course they didn't. I would have triedthe much less expensive Grizzly if I knew that qualitycontrol at Powermatic was so lax."
3,Factory assembly problems,My jointer was delivered with two dents in the machine base. Only one blade was installed so it actually would cut. The other two blades were seated below the cutter head. One of the blades has a large nick in it. The table top has a small rust spot that is pretty deep. Dust collection doesn't seem to work very well either. I feel a machine of supposedly high qaulity and price should be assembled with more attention to detail at the factory. After getting a new blade and setting up the machine it seems to work okay.
4,High-quality jointer,"This machine says ""Industrial grade"" when you start it and use it. Yes, get a friend to assist in assembly, the top is too heavy to do alone. Yes, the accuracy was exceptional right out of the box. The ""only"" adjustment I needed was a small change to the 90 degree stop on the fence, all other settings were right on the button. Plug it in, turn it on, and the sound of the motor says ""this is a quality machine"". First project it was used on was a large built in wall cabinet set, poplar & birch, and it handled all the work VERY well, very smooth edges and faces, never bogged down under load. It's a great machine."
5,don't hesitate,This jointer arrived perfect. It was easy to assemble. The long infeed and outfeed tables make all the difference. Click and buy it.. no tax and free shipping!!!
2,Not recommended,"My mama always said, ""if it aint broke, don't fix it."" That was never more true than with this software. This software (and system works) fixes ""problems"" that aren't even there, and causes there to be major conflicts with other software. It's so bad, there was a MAJOR conflict with this program a Norton Anti-Virus 2000, that made the Anti-virus software just not respond, ever. Then the computer would always go to the ""blue screen of death"" each time I booted Windows ME. Once I uninstalled Utilities, there were no more problems.I spoke with some rechs at Dell, (the place where I purchased my computer), and they said Utilities does that alot, and that unless you know EXACTLY what you are doing, stay away"
1,Trash at best (The CD at least can be used as skeet),"Be Warned They CHARGE for Call in support now!!In my opinion; Norton used to make some great products. I used to recommend their Norton Utilities and Anti Virus programs to friends and install them on computers I assembled for them. Sadly, this has changed. They now have an online forum where you are forced to ask your questions. They may even get around to answering your question, but it takes days to get correct answers (if ever). The quality of their software has plummeted also. Several other companies make similar products that are FAR superior. Not only do I not give them a positive review, I strongly recommend you do NOT use them."
2,Hurts more than it even attempts to help...,"I used to like Norton's utility suite, but the minor conflicts that would pop up on the early versions have morphed into major bugs and compatability issues that plague the newest release. Most of the utilities here just don't get along with other software, and for a package that is supposed to fix up your system it caused an awful lot of freeze-ups and blue screens."
4,Great product...with one problem,"I've been using Norton products for many years without a problem. This version of Utilities further solified Norton's reputation in my eyes. I've had just one problem with the software (that I'm still working on). For an unknown reason, Norton Protection of my Recycle Bin has failed. It produces 1,500 files in the Recycle Bin, and causes CPU usage to stay at 95% or better, slowing the computer down to a crawl at best. Deleting the files temporarily fixes the problem, but the files are eventually re-created. I've had to disable that feature for now, but I would not let this dissuade you from installing this. It's been a godsend otherwise."
4,Buen producto,"Es un buen producto, aunque tiene sus deficiencias pues hay una parte de el que no es tan facil de usar, lo cual podria causar problemas a personas que no tienen muchos conocimientos de computación."
5,snoop doggs father hood,"i havit stop watching fatherhood.. i use to love to see whats going to happen next..... my mother don,t like rapper,s til she watch some of snoop dogg father hood and now she have respect for them now...........I want everyone who sell on amazon to keep up the good work..."
5,maximum best,"There's nothing better than hearing a great living legend. Evertime I go to one of his concerts, I see every generation there. People bring their children, and grandchildren. Nothing better than the best."
3,Good Book Some Details are debatable.,Not A Bad Read But some of the facts are debatable.Read more than this book on DHEA to make an informed desision.
2,"A biochemist's view, not a medical doctor's view","This book is written in the view of a biochemist, instead of a medical doctor. Actually, some information regarding prostate cancer and testosterone is incorrect, other information are not enough if not incorrect."
5,Legal Androgel,DHEA is the only drug that has made my testicles bigger.I suffer from HYPOGONADISM.Taking testosterone only made them smaller.This is a great book for those who want to feel like a man again.I only take 25mg. a day you don't really need that much.
2,"Fascinating subject, but","rather disappointing reading. Instead of a story telling or narrative style, the author presents his material as if it were evidence in a court of law. Too many extracts of letters & documents. Makes for a persuasive, but unimaginative and dull argument. Also, a little too much editorializing."
1,Eddy latest victim of Orthodoxy's talented serial killer.,"Fine rehashing of debunking literature on Eddy. If you are sure you don't like her, here is a good night's reading. Lot's of convincing arguments on a plagarism charge, but little that hasn't been published previously."
2,Did I miss something?,"This book won awards? Did I miss something? Sure, the black and white art is incredible. And there is a central mystery that is intriguing. But where is the subtlety in the storyline? It's one bloody fight scene after another. Frank Miller has come a long way from his days of the Dark Knight, Daredevil, and Ronin, and it hasn't always been an improvement. Where is the scintillating dialogue and complex storytelling that marked his early career? I measure a comic's success by whether I want to back to re-read it. I've only read Sin City once, and it's been sitting on my shelf collecting dust a long time"
2,average,this book was not that great. i am not impressed. i probably just did not care for the style of the book. i will not buy any more.
2,"Interesting art, worthless story.","Two words, actually: Mind Trash.What happened to Frank Miller? The guy actually used to put some thought into his scripts -- Daredevil, Elektra: Assasin, Dark Knight, Ronin -- but now he just churns out blood. Sin City's plots make no sense, the dialogue is cliched and the voice-over narration almost too cheesy to believe.Sin City does feature the best Miller illustration I've ever seen. It's a shame, because if Ronin had been matched with this kind of Miller draftsmanship, it would have been the best genre comic of the '80s.Oh well. Maybe Studio Proteus can package this garbage as manga, since the average Sin City issue only takes about four minutes to read."
5,One of the best graphic novels ever,"What can I say that hasn't already been said. Yes, it is violent and yes, Marv, the main character probably isn't your friendly everyday neighbor. But who cares? This is a comic book. It has a truely amazing storyline, the most wonderful graphic art I've ever witnessed in black and white. Superb!!!If you like this one, check out Frank Miller's ""Daredevil, The Man without Fear"" and ""Batman, the Dark Knight Returns""."
5,It's Miller time!,"This is an absolutely fantastic black and white graphic novel by Frank Miller, who helped revitalize the superhero genre with his versions of Batman and Daredevil. Sin City might be described as ""film noir"", except for the fact that it isn't a film, it's a comic book. But it soon will be afilm! Frank Miller himself has co-directed the film with Robert Rodriguez, so there is a good chance it will be faithful to the comic book. The film adapts more than one of the Sin City graphic novels, but I thought people might like to know who plays the characters from this particular book:Mickey Rourke plays Marv.Jaime King plays Goldie.Carla Gugino plays Lucille.Jessica Alba plays Nancy.Elijah Wood plays Kevin.Rosario Dawson plays Gail.Rutger Hauer plays Roark."
3,Beautifully Drawn But Very Short,"The first sin city is a simple mainly to have something to show off the beautiful drawings. It was a bit over the top, but not as much as ""A Dame to Kill For."" You can finish reading ""Sin City"" the original in about an hour or less, though it's more fun to page through the book for the illustrations where it is much stronger."
4,Wow!,"This is unlike anything I have ever read. It remains as shocking, in many ways, today as it did when originally released. This is a unique literary effort that also happens to be strongly illustrated."
3,"Check it out now, bust a groove, SIN, CHARACTER?","The art in this title is amazing. The plot was very cool. The characterization however could have been a lot better. Marv seemed to be innconsistant. He would jump back from idiot to to fearless barbarian to cowering child to long winded narrator. I didn't get Marv, in his stupid obssesive barbarian mode he shines but all others he annoys. If Marv had been more consistant this would be a 4 1/2 star book. If the rest of the characters had more character(Goldie, Roark) a 5 star book. Art was very unique and the plot was fun yet Miller should have spent more time on the characters and narration. The narration was lacking. Most will still enjoy but maybe not fall in love. Check out ""Kabuki: Circle of Blood"" by David Mack."
5,"NEW AGE CRIME NOVEL.READ THIS BOOK, YOU WILL THANK ME LATER!","the town of sin city is an unforgiving town in which anything can and will happen. From the first page you are intrigued by what is going on, and it keeps you wanting to continue reading the story. It is told in black and white comic book format but do not let that discourage you from reading or even buying this book. The unique style of Frank Miller tears you into this world of hate and revenge and makes you feel for the main character Marv. It is a classic revenge story told in a new way, in which a criminal uses his ""skills"" to get done what needs to get done. The characters are living, breathing people and you want them to suceed in thier goals. This book will knock your socks off."
4,A Pleasent Surprise,"This book by Robert Scalione (author) and William Cummins (artist) was a pleasent surprise. My wife received this book from her Sensei Matt Kaplan (When we lived in Hawaii), who was a student of Sensei Scaglione. She brought it home, and myself being a Karate instructor, immeadiately read the text with interest and a critical eye.This book is not a primer on technique, but instead, a primer on the mental aspects of the martial arts. Often, comercial books are flooded with ""action"" photos, yet, neglecting the most important weapon and training tool - the mind.This book is also very easy to read, yet, refreshing enough for more mature martial readers to enjoy. The art work is simple and standard, but adequate enough for this excellent text. A great book."
2,Awful,"Poorly written and terribly illustrated with poor quality images and even worse maps, this book is deadeningly boring to read and takes all the action out of warfare. Side bars often make no sense and are at times irrelevant."
2,Pretty but not soothing,"This is a very pretty lullaby collection overlayed with bird and nature sounds. However, my 16 month old was not lulled to sleep because the chirping noises attracted her attention and she wanted to clap her hands instead. The bird noises actually sound more like early morning chirping."
5,A true blessing to all who hear it!!,"Songs from the Book is a wonderful CD full of the praises of GOD! I love the entire CD. But ""El Shaddai"" by Winans Phase II is a particular favorite of mine. These are a group of great guys who love the lord and I respect them for that. I'm glad to say that I know these guys and I wish the best of success on their upcoming Cd ""We Got Next"". It's a treasure. God Bless!"
2,YAWN,"I agree with the guy who liked the cover art. This is a really god awful CD that is hugely unfocused and not very listenable. The only saving graces are track 2 'seashell', a gorgeous laidback trip hop ambient ride that sounds like it doesn't belong on this CD at all. And track 13 'exotika' (amazon accidentally omitted track 3 'depart' so there's actually 13 tracks),a ten minute out of body dub experience that makes you feel like you're floating along in outer space. If the rest of the tracks lived up to these two this would be an awesome CD. But they don't and it isn't. Even after repeated listenings it only gets worse. The only reason I'm still hanging on to this is simply for 'seashell'. This is a dull ambient ride that's more irritating than soothing."
2,I like the cover,"This cd certainly has an odd atmosphere to it. Perhaps the beginning of track #13 ""Exotica"" is a clue as to why, when a voice recites ""It's hard not to be open minded when you take psychedelics once a week...take psychedelics once a week...take psychedelics once a week..."". It then fades out into music. The tracks on this cd are rather laid back and odd, as if they were created by very inexperienced musicians messing around on synthesizers. However, it is track #4, ""Next"", that has me pull out this cd occasionally. It's nothing spectacular, but has a sort of mellow droopy groove that is somewhat appealing to me. I also heard it on either a television or radio commercial once. Otherwise, this cd is difficult to really like, even after repeated listenings. It's more annoying and boring than appealing."
4,does the job,I wanted an inexpensive little phone with numbers that lit up so I could use it in the dark where we sleep. That's just what I got -- an inexpensive little phone with lit-up numbers. It does the job.
3,ACAPULCO GOLD!,"SEE former child evangelist MARJOE GORTNER as an ordinary Joe who gets involved in a dangerous DRUG SMUGGLING scheme in beautiful HAWAII! This is movie made especially for the DRUG CULTURE circa 1974! This movie actually played as a DOUBLE-FEATURE with that CHEECH & CHONG epic, ""Up in Smoke!"" There must be HUNDREDS of things you could do with your money that would be more enjoyable than WATCHING this film!"
3,"Nice, but not the originals","These are the 1996 re-recordings (which are on so many of the hit compilations currently available. While many of these are nice (and some are excellent), look for the originals. If you want to hear Merle in his later years, buy the new stuff, because it's great!"
5,Same exact product at half the cost,"We are talking apples for apples here. The local parts store, noted for good prices, was twice as high on these particular items. While that may not always be the case, this is the place to get Anchor motor mounts. Received quickly and in better condition than direct from bricks and mortar."
2,atrocities eh?,"I guess if you're looking for a dvd of old news reels from the 40s then this is for you...However if,like me,you were looking for concentration camp footage,or perhaps anything even remotely entertaining,then I suggest you look else where because this dvd DOES NOT DELIVER.To sum up,spend a few more dollars and get something else."
3,WHY WE FIGHT,ALLTHOUGH WHATEVER THE HITMAN DID WAS AN ATROCITE . THIS DVDIS : #1 & #3 FROM THE FRANK CAPRA SERIES (7 total) of WHY WE FIGHT DONE DURING WW2 . IF YOU ARE LOOKING for THE REAL HORRORS buy DVDs FROM THE -HOLOCAUST SERIES-Holocaust: The Liberation of Auschwitzor -NUREMBURG The Nazis Facing There Crimes-Nuremberg: The Nazis Facing Their Crimesor NIGHT AND FOG by Alain Resnai .Night and Fog - Criterion Collection
2,Arrived damaged,"Needed the item for a special project but it arrived damaged (one of the two leveling bubbles lost it's fluid at some point) and was not useable. Have not yet figured out who to return it to. Don't know how to change the intro of this review from ""Very Pleased"" because I am not very pleased with this item, although I have purchased a lot of goods from Amazon over the years and it is rare that I am disappointed"
4,K-Cliffs Laptop Computer Backpack,Bought it for my daughter. She seems to like it. Plenty of room. Only complaint is the handle at the top of the backpack that you can see in the picture ripped off the first time I picked the backpack up by it.
1,Fell Apart on us,"This backpack looked great, and it seems to have worked well for many others. Sadly, for us, it started to lose seams after just a couple days of use. My wife didn't put overly too much stuff in it, but it still didn't hold up. Anyway, while the item wasn't very good, Amazon.com took awesome care of us and we were able to get a complete refund."
5,Great backpack,1 of 15.4 inch K-Cliffs Mutilple Compartment Organizer Laptop Computer Notebook Backpack School Bag [ASIN: B000HT5JJQ]This backpack exceeded my expectations. I love the different compartments and the padded cover for my laptop. It is very versatile. I would recommend this bag for anyone.
2,Waist Straps Simply Too Light Weight,"The waist straps are simply too light wight to allow transfer of the weight of the backpack's contents to one's hips. What attracted us to this backpack was that it was designed to transfer some of the weight from the shoulders to the hips, but the backpack was not sufficiently sturdy."
3,Nice item but has a bad top handle,"This backpack has a bad design and convenient, but the top handle teared off in 2 days, and i did not put something heavier than a laptop and couple of cd cases, andd carried it no more than 100 metres.Item was succesfully returned and get dell backpack instead."
1,Shoddy Workmanship,"I purchased this backpack for my son's senior year in High School. He has used the same one (a Nike brand) for the previous 4 years very successfully but I thought that since he now carries a laptop that he should have something more geared to that, for protection.He got less than 2 weeks of active use out of it before a strap completely broke off, and that's being fairly generous with the time line.Horrible quality, will never purchase from them again.Off to look for something that will actually last for at least a year of schooling."
2,Too romantically written,"In an ideal world, we'd all have parents who we would want to help in old age, and it would be our honor to help them in their old age as they have helped us in our youth.However, for the children of substance abuse parents and/or mentally ill patients the answers do not come easy. Things are much more complicated than simply finding a place to live, and deciding how much time you can spend with said loved one.I'm not trying to over simplify, because all decisions dealing with older loved ones are difficult, but I was kind of hoping it would have given me more direction as to when its important to protect yourself as well. Its easy to get caught up in the caretaker role, feeling like a matyr without thinking about wheither or not this is the best desicion for you and your immediate family. Especially, if its puts you at risk for other health issues."
3,Do I have the same CD as the other reviewers?,"After reading the wonderful reviews, I ordered this CD for my 11-month old daughter. I am so disappointed by it that I wonder if I received the right CD! I expected cheerful, fun and happy songs; instead, the songs are quite slow and somewhat depressing in tone if not in words. I can't imagine how people dance to this music!! I played the CD once and have no plans to play it again. Although its not horrible, I don't find it cheerful, uplifiting or fun at all. It might work for right before bed to calm the baby down, but that is the only use I can think of for it. IF you're looking for more fun songs, I would recommend the WEE SING series."
3,One of those movies you stumble across,"and are really glad you did. Just a great little thriller-comedy. McDowell is superb, and the photography and supporting cast ain't bad, either. Yes, a few strange parts, but so what? Worth seeing!"
3,Odd Alaskia Murder Tale That Lacks Suspense and Closure,"At the very kickoff of this peculiar tale of serial murder, the viewer is promptly told who the culprit of a gory string of serial murders is: The demon barber of Revelstoke Alaska, Malcolm Mcdowell. This guts most of the suspense out of the story, which leaves the primary focal point an FBI vs local police rivalry as the chief point of tension and conflict to sustain the viewer's interest. It was a well-acted, decently scripted drama with a decidedly unsatisfying finish (with Mcdowell hitching a ride into the darkness with the FBI agent who bungled the case)set in the all-day perma-blackness of winter-time Alaska--the polar opposite of the venue depicted in Insomnia. It is an odd, strange film set in a off-beat location that will leave the viewing asking ""why?"" and wondering ""how?"""
1,WTF,"This is one of the worst horror movies Ive ever seen, if you can even call it that. The barber has one of the worst killers that ive been unfortunate enough to see. The idea of a killer barber sounded kind of interesting but was not done well. If you are expecting a Dr Giggles type flick, stay very far away."
4,The Barber from Hell,"I enjoy Malcolm McDowell and think he's one hell of an actor. That being said, I was reluctant to rent this movie. I find that I either really like McDowell films or hate them, and based on the description on the jacket, I expected to hate it. I was pleasently surprised. The Barber Shop is an interesting tale of the events in a small town near the North Pole during the winter as told by a serial killer. It allows some good insight into the killer's mind and relationships with other people. IMHO, well worth the watch."
4,The Barber- A cut above the rest!,"After actually being involved with the shooting of The Barber, I was anticipating it's release. I was pleasantly surprised at the finished product. A solid script with believable characters and thrilling plot that will have you continuously wondering- will they catch him? Malcolm Mcdowell is eerily fantastic. With a simple facial expression, added with his chilling narration, he successfully brings to life, Dexter, a psychopath you love to hate.Can't wait for the sequal!"
3,Close-no cigar,"It didn't fit the best, ended up getting another brand. Kept this and put it on a Squire. Not exactly USA fit."
4,Highlander rocks !,"This album rocks! If you love a good concept rock album, try this one out. The made up story of Rory MacLeod, who joins Robert the Bruce in his fight against the english. Good variety, good guitarwork, good voice, fantastic concept !"
3,Not blown away - 3.5 stars.,"My first reaction to the cuts on this album was to hit the next track button as fast as I could. Every song sounded alike and Sean's delicate tenor just hit a raw nerve with me. It was all just too cute and too perfect and too light.Later, I listened again and decided I liked the music well enough, but was just not blown away by it. Good but not great. I expected more because I thought Sean's guitar work on Nickel Creek was some of the best I'd heard. His song writing is very skilled but maybe a tad too literary. More thought-full than full of feeling.""Chutes and Ladders"" is the highest energy, jazziest, driving cut. It is almost, by itself, worth the price of the CD."
5,yet another hit!!,I am a huge fan of this guy!! He sings more on this cd. He really has a special talent in his song writing and in his guitar playing! I would say go ahead and buy it. Don't forget his nickel creek cd's too!!
5,Brilliant indeed,"Ditto the other reviews. Watkins is amazing. Continuing in fine Nickel Creek progressive acoustic tradition. This album waltzes in to the Pop realm...smooth as a gravy sandwich. I love it, I love it, I love it. Something for everyone. Some of the best solo work in ""Chutes and Ladders"" that you'll hear anywhere....who are these guys? Buy a dozen and spread the musical truth."
1,Anyone want to buy my copy?,"Let me first say I am a Nickel Creek fan and also a fan of jazz and bluegrass. I like Sean's work on the Nickel Creek recordings and feel he is a very talented individual. I don't know what happened when he made this album. The drummer on this CD sounds like a junior high kid that just got his first drum set. Most of the cuts that included instruments without strings were disconnected. Sort of like a high school garage band. Sorry to say, this will be one of the first CDs in a long time that I will be glad to sell. Now to find the link to Amazon auctions...."
2,Extremely Weak.,"Jay and Rebecca Clarke seem to have had trouble with this latest stanza in their long running series. They have left the world of RCMP stereotypes and shifted to old Nazi stereotypes, taking swipes at the US space program at the same time. The tone is very forced and nothing seems to work right. The good news is that it's a quick read even if most of it is concocted German history.The RCMP spends a good bit of its time spinning its wheels waiting for the killer(s) to make a bad mistake. The profile for the murderers is so patchwork that I occasions felt surprise that they could get anything done. At the end of this tale nobody comes off well"
4,Get your tin foil hat,"This one wasn't as good as Slade's previous books, but it is worth reading. However, before reading this book, repeat to yourself ""I believe, I believe, I believe."" If you remember that this is fiction, you can enjoy this book. If you try to take everything seriously, you'll hate it.Contrary to what one reviewer wrote, the physical and mental disorders suffered by the title character do exist."
3,Slade continues the gore-fest!,"Another gory edition from Slade... more history than normal and a lot of my favorite characters (including DeClerq and Zinc Chandler) are missing! Not as good as some of the early books (Headhunter, Ghoul) which are still the best in my opinion. Felt the ending was weak - it appeared that they got tired of writing and rushed the end... who is it, who is it,then that's it... no more detail just find out and finish!!! Not as good a read as I was hoping."
5,"More Matter, Less Art","With the latest entry into the world of Special X, Swastika, Michael Slade moves away from some of the familiar faces of previous stories and introduces a pair of newcomers to the scene. While fan favorites such as Zinc Chandler and Robert Declerq make brief appearances, they are not the primary characters this time around - and this is okay, because Slade does a wonderful job integrating the new characters into his universe.The strength of Swastika is its story, which is fast-paced page turning executed to perfection. Slade is a master of using history to create a memorable story, and this book is no different: the action moves flawlessly from World War Two era Germany to modern day and then back again, making for an entertaining history lesson woven in between suspense-filled chapters.Fans of Slade will not be disappointed, and those not yet initiated into the realm of Special X will find Swastika to be an excellent place to start."
3,Very Uneven,"The beginning of this film is amazing. The first scenes create the impression that this will be the best and most original vampire movie since Near Dark, and the direction during these scenes is excellent. It is almost like a low-budget cross between David Lynch and David Fincher, especially with its sound design (lots of drones). Unfortunately, what starts out as an excellent film which manages to be equal parts serious drama and black comedy quickly loses all of its steam as soon as the vampire's slave decides he's had enough and is going to quit. After that the directing style actually becomes weaker and at times silly, as does the comedy, and the drama almost completely disappears. There are a few moments throughout the film, especially the scenes with the old man Marvin, who is always funny, which make it bearable to sit through to the end, but ultimately the last two-thirds are just a weak, low-budget vampire film with some comedy."
4,Bloody Good,"If you like a bit of gore, a little hoaky stuff and a wacky story line, you'll love this movie. Bare bodies are bouncing around all over the place. Good work for a low budget film. The brief role of the mother is outstanding and very scary. She has such depth and sincerity. It will be difficult to keep a dry eye. She felt this part from the tip of her toes to the end of her teeth. I know. I was right there with her!"
2,First Half Good,"This film starts off really well, it is full of mild horror; a vampire likes to paint using real blood, & drains a few women to top up her supply.Then the film changes to become a typical Troma loser (an attempt at comedy?). I'm not sure if they used the scripts from two different films for this, 1/2 of one 1/2 of the other."
1,NICE intro for a... BAD movie...,"Don't get me wrong: I love bad movies, but this thing is trying to be a comedy-horror-erotic film all at once, and it fails miserably. There is but one compelling thing to this movie: The intro. EXCELLENT directing, and very effective performances in the first 5 minutes. My goodness, once I was finished with this movie, I felt as I did when I walked out of seeing A.I.: Very,very,very insulted."
5,This Movie Rocks!!!,"This film captures the best of two genres, horror and comedy. The director displays a talent and maturity that's too rare today."
1,Garbage,"I love watching B-horror movies, unfortunately, this one rates an F. How bad is it? They flash the word HORROR on the screen when you are supposed to be scared! I can't figure out why--perhaps because they realized it wasn't scary too, maybe it is intended to distract from the fact that the actors don't look scared, or can't act, or that they shot it with a consumer grade DV camera. Who knows?!? Ultimately, if you like wasting money this is a great way to lose a couple of bucks."
5,Big saw for a little price,"I've owned this saw for over a year now and its been very reliable to me. I do like milwauke sawzaws but they are much more expensive. For the price of this little guy its definetly a great buy. It has cut everything from pvc, cast iron, wood, and steel."
5,Great saw for the price.,"I ordered this saw to do some remodeling work in my condo. This saw ate through the 2-1/4 inch plaster/masonary walls like butter. I took out two medium sized walls in about 8 hours time, including cleanup.The saw has no balancer in it, so it does get a bit uncomfortable to use after a certain time frame. However, to get the balancer feature, you really have to step up the price.Changing blades is relatively easy with the keyless quick change. Just watch out for the hot blades!Bottom line, I would have no problem recommending this tool to anyone in need of a Sawzall. I plan to use it in several more wall demolition projects. It is perfect for occasional use. Contractor types may wish to buy a higher priced model."
5,Mooradian Shaped Violin Slip-On Cover Black with Back-Pack Straps,"I bought the full size for a 3/4 size violin, but it still does the job and will continue using this bag for a full size violin later."
3,Not Great...but better than some,If you are taking this class as an undergrad I would caution that it is extremely hard if not impossible and the book is not much help. The examples are not terribly detailed and they are overly difficult to follow. Good Luck:)
2,You'll get lost on backroads with this one,"I bought this map book prior to my recent June 2008 visit to northeastern Vermont (Northeast Kingdom). I was disappointed. What is shown as a road is actually an impassable trail. Roads shown to connect sometimes do not. Needless to say, I wasted a good amount of time and fuel. You might be the first person to ground truth the maps. Good luck!"
2,"Not updated, often inaccurate","I loved this atlas -- until I began trying to drive on roads that weren't there. It is obvious Delorme hasn't taken the time to test and update their information. Many roads that show on the map end partway through in someone's yard, or turn into impassable trails (even for an SUV), some of which pass through private property. Delorme, do your homework!"
3,OK for low light...,"This laser level performs as advertised. It was very easy to set up and use in both the horizontal and vertical modes. The lasers seem bright, but were very hard to see outdoors, and impossible in bright sunlight. I will be keeping the product for use indoors only."
2,Not up to DeWALT standards,"From the moment you receive the box you start to have doubts about this tool. The first thing you notice is that things are banging around loose in the carrying case and it goes down hill from there. When I opened the case the accessories were out of place and do not stay in place when back in the labeled areas. The thing is huge and heavy. I set it up and it took ten minutes to level with the sloppy adjusting knobs, complete with dead spots as someone else mentioned. The bubbles are very hard to center and the line is almost a quarter of an inch wide. It's not a self leveler and I expected this would be compensated for in DeWALT quality. I was wrong and this thing reminds me more of an old Tonka Toy than a precision instrument. The little Johnson self leveler is a far better tool. I'm keeping it because I will only use it occasionally but If I were a contractor it would be on its way back."
2,Imprecise & Drifts Off Level,"The levelling knobs have slop or dead zones when adjusting the bubbles. The beam was at least 1/4-inch wide causing a 'hysteresis' affect when approaching opposite sides of the beam, giving two different level-lines (which must be averaged). The instrument appears to drift significantly off level in outdoor use. When outdoors, changing temperatures and/or sun angles require checking and adjusting the level vials frequently. Recommend a better quality self-compensating instrument."
2,Well?,"The first one that I ordered came in fast .but it did not work so I shipped it back,and they said that that company was out of stock,so I ordered one from different company on amazon cheaper that the one I ordered earlier,it came in but took longer.opened it up to set it up and the level bubble was cracked in it and no fluid in it so it cannot be leveled up to use it,I wasn't going to send back for a second time so I took it apart and replaced the piece and fixed it myself,works good nowThanks Jerry"
1,not accurate enough,"I am a big Dewalt fan. I have a trailor full of Dewalt tools, so when I saw this laser I had to have one. This is the first Dewalt product I have been dissapointed in. As a home builder I demand accracy. When I tested this laser I found it to be off by 1/2 an inch in 20 feet. I tested it against another laser and by my transit. The vial levels difficult to ""zero in"". You can turn the adjustment knobs as much as one complete turn and they still show level. This is not acceptable. I was very dissapointed in this product."
4,Its worth the price,"Hello, as an owner of a suspended acoustical ceiling company I was thoughroughly pleased to find this inexpensive laser so accurate. I own 2 other larger lasers and had them out on jobs with my crews and found the need-emergency- for another but didnt want to pay the price of the big lasers so I purchased this particular laser and it performed admirably for a manual level laser and I would recommend this product to anyone who would like the job as close to perfect and staying on a budget as you could get."
4,yummy!,This fun and flirty spray is great. Ive been looking for it for a few years now since Walgreens quite carrying it
5,Unbelievable Jazz Compilation!!,"If you are into jazz this album-cd rather is a must have especially if you are a Jaco Pastorius fan, Albert Mangelsdorff brings on Jaco and Alphonse Mouzon I believe is without a doubt one of the best drummers-percusionist I have ever heard they hit strides and grooves that are out of this world and a very enjoyable and relaxing cd to listen too. I was very pleased well worth the money paid for it. Fantastic cd!"
2,Bad for ME,"I personally don't recommend this product for WME users.For my 600MHz computer running Windows ME, IBM included a notice in the box claimed performance issues while running with WME, as well as that important ""direct dictation"" feature for works other than word processing (ie using Excel/Outlook/IE4) will cause crashes. This made it not worth the price, and the risk of losing data.However, it works exceptionally well for 600MHz running Windows 98 including 2nd Edition, for that I will give 4 stars."
3,I love this type of bottle but I prefer the larger nipple,I've bought these bottles at local stores like Walgreen's for both of my children who are breastfed but I also feed the occasional bottle. The nipples started getting sticky after my second child and so I looked for replacements. My stores no longer carry them so I checked on Amazon. These are the same type of bottles that I'm accustomed to however the nipples are much smaller. I probably should have paid more attention but they must be for newborns because they're very small. I tried giving it to my son anyway but he was having difficulty and was making loud slurping noises and taking in a lot of air. I will not be able to use these nipples for him but will save them for my next baby for their first couple months of life. However I always gave the bigger nipples to my children no matter what their age and they seem to work better so I would recommend just buying those but the same brand and type.
1,Terrible,These bottles are made of a very cheap plastic. One of the nipples was missing when the product arrived. I would not recommend them at all.
4,Haunted Junction - DVD Collection,"I think that titles of Bandai Entertainment are comparatively reliable. Most of all, the price of this title is quite reasonable. This title has all 12 episodes in two disks. Nevertheless, the quality of video is not bad. Generally, looks like good title. If you are a fan of Ranma 1/2 or Urusei Yatsura, you can enjoy this."
5,A must buy,"A unique gem, the quality of humor was something I had not encountered before. Get it, laugh, be sad when it's over."
3,Ghostly laughs,"I liked that this was a funny anime, however I felt that the girl liking younger boys (12 and younger) was totally gross. I don't know if it was done for laughs or what. But I did like the Council President and the boy, kazumi, who gets posessed by spirits of dead animals. I thought that was totally hilarious. I would not recommend this series for children, but for teenagers and older, sure. Also, on another bad note, I hated that this anime only came in english subtitles or original japanese language. I would have laughed more if I didn't have to read the dubbing instead of watching the screen where the action was taking place between the three main characters and the ghosts."
4,"Great, Hilarious, Off-the-wall Anime :-)","How would you like to get credit for classes you never take, converse freely with supernatural entities, and have a new comedy-filled adventure every day? Thus sums up the Haunted Junction series. This is a great, hilarious series, with an odd mixture of Human students (including a girl who LOVES young boys - you don't see THAT every day in anime!!!) and school spirits at a Tokyo high school with such a poor reputation and high level of spiritual energy that no one can transfer from the school and professional exorcists flee in terror at simply hearing the school's name.Now if only I had a Toilet Hanako in my apartment....."
5,Scary Fork? NO!! HAUNTED JUNCTION!,"For those of you who don't know, Haunted Junction is an anime series, a short one, but a very good one. In my opinion it is one of the best anime's out there. The story basis runs along Saito High School, a school that is overrun by ghosts and other spirits. Within these school walls exists the Holy Student Council, whose sole aim is to keep the ghosts in line, while not getting a heart attack at the same time. I don't want to give too much of the story away so get it yourself. You'll laugh, cry, and maybe even soil your pants. Chow ^_~"
2,Eat-Man 6 Volume Box Set,"Here is a wonderful example of someone taking a good manga and completely wasting it. As it stands, very little about this series is actually worth your time; The art is very nice, animated very smoothly and nice line work. Everything else, on the other hand, is pretty pathetic. The music is pretty jarring and doesn't fit the theme at all. The opening and closing songs are totally uninteresting, and both sequences are visually underwhelming. The characters are horribly two dimensional, a mercenary Damsel in distress? Give me a break. There is no character intorduction at all, so you can't really bring yourself to care about anybody, hero or otherwise. Since it is episodic in nature, you never really get any serious insight into Bolt's character, and all the characters that seem interesting are gone in the next episode."
5,The *New* Student Council,"Haunted Junction, a ridiculous comedy about three high school students and the seven spirits that haunt their school. Haunted Junction is like X-files with a twist of Japanese comedy. The three students work together as the ""Holy Student Council"" chosen specifically out of the other students because of their religious background. Should anything get between their school and the spirits that live there, the seven school spirits are always ready to... find some creative hijinx to play around with the enemy. For the lover of anime, silly slapstick comdey, and the sci-fi fantatic, Haunted Junction is definetly worth watching!"
4,in good shaped shipped fast,gave it as a gift my boy liked it he watched it twice he likes k c he like the dvd very much
2,it smells girly,"i bought it for my 4 month old son who has what seems like a severe case of eczema and dry skin, so like every concerned mother i have been trying and testing out any product hoping it will help his skin,or suits him best, unfortunately this one didnt work on him like i expected, moreover it made him smell a bit girly,the sweet almond oil reminded me of an asian indian sweet store LOL!but the packaging was nice and pretty, tiny like travel sized, and smells sweet ; if you have a little doll :)"
1,"Frustrating, not for serious players","I haven't had any software problems in XP, unlike many other reviewers, but I always make a point of minimum installations. However, the dictionary in the game is bad -- in particular, it does *not* use the latest Official Dictionary (4th edition). To take one example, the word QI and the plural QIS are not available in this game, and those are important Q-without-U words for serious Scrabble.I wouldn't mind that fault if the software allowed you to add words to the dictionary or to override computer challenges. Alas, neither option is available so it's critical that the dictionary be right. But the dictionary is wrong. So the game is wrong. It's not Scrabble."
4,"Great Game, unfortunately needs a tweak","This is my favorite of all the Scrabble games released for PC. Unfortunately online play isn't supported at MSN Zone anymore. Running it on Windows XP unfortunately requires a little tweaking. Once installed, right click on the icon it creates and select properties. From the Compatibility tab, select Disable Visual Themes and Turn off advanced text services for this program.The mini games are great for learning. If not for the outdated dictionary and the undocumented tweak this game gets 5 stars from me. Graphics are beautiful and the game actually tries to teach you how to play effectively. This is a simple repackaging of Scrabble 2 or Scrabble ""Red""."
1,"Way old, out of date version","This version is so old, the visuals are all grainy, and hard to see. The game is not at all pleasant to play, compared to the new versions, and you have to keep the CD in the drive all the time to play it, even after you install the game. I think it is sucking up a massive amount of juice to play it, too. (The reason I got rid of Scrabout).This does NOT come with a jewel case - just a paper sleeve, and there's no paperwork or support for the game, either. The only info provided is on the disk, and that support number is disconnected. Seller claims to have no knowledge of computer games (Despite being primarily a seller of computer games), and just refers you to the disconnected support number.It was cheap, so I'm just eating this one, but I won't be buying anything from this bunch again. Spare yourself some agony, and download a trial software, test it, and if you like it, spend the extra $10. and get the newest version."
2,disappointed in this game's performance,"I bought this game to replace the Scrabble 2.0 because it was purported to be windows xp compatible. Unfortunately, it does the same thing the old game did, which is go to a black screen during play,which was only resolved by ""painting"" the game back into view with the mouse. I searched for remedies to this major inconvienence, to no avail. It's a good thing I didn't waste a whole lot of cash on my purchase. I can't recommend this game to anyone. It's unfortunate, because it is a very nice game otherwise."
1,Compatibility issues!,"My issue is with the game maker Encore not the game there are too many things that will not let you play version of this game. I had go into ""MSCONFIG"" and shut everything down to even get it to load. And as is the ""norm"" these days you can't get a service rep that speaks English clearly to help find the trouble. I would say find a different company, not Encore to buy the game from. O and their idea of a ""Jewel case"" is a paper envelope wrapped in a piece of card board."
3,Scrabble,"Item was sent very poorly packaged. Game has many glitches. When we can get it to work on our PC, great game."
4,for scrabble wannabes,i enjoy this game and play it a lotmy main complaint is that when it challenges you it doesn't give you an opportunity to defend your play
1,Needs lots of work.,I have this one also and refering to the problem that other had with the screen going black. Mine does too. But just for a few seconds while the game initializes. So that wasn't a porblem for me. My problem is that the computer challenges words that I know for a fact are in the dictionary and when it challenges you you have no chance to refute the challenge. It automatically removes your word and you lose your turn. But players are NEVER allowed to challenge the computer. Which I find really stupid. The computer also plays words that are not allowed by the scrabble rules. In other words it cheats. I think that the people who disigned it purposely made it that way. I would not recommend wasting your money on it.
2,Not as expected,You have to have the cd on your drive in order to play it. A hassle. I have played other scrabble games better than this one.
2,"Not as good as the Scrabble ""Champion Edition""","I recieved it and it works fine, but it is not nearly as good for my purposes as the ""Champion Edition."" If I had it to do over, I would order the ""Champion Edition"" instead. That one has ""Best Plays"" option so I can check my word against others to see if I chose the highest scoring word. That feature is lacking from the ""Scrabble Complete,"" the subject of this review. I would have thought ""Complete"" would mean it has all options, but apparently not. --"
1,Warning! Do not buy this game.,"This is a total waste of money. Game has defects and will not work well on XP. Empire is no help and their forums are a joke ""Help, I have a black screen"" ""I know of no solution at this time."" It is also cd dependant to run, meaning you have to lug a cd around with you if you want to play the game (when it will play). After a day of frustration trying to get this thing to work, the game ended up in the trash. That toss into the trash was the most fun I got out of the game!"
1,Don't bother,"I had the same problem as the others with XP. Pay attention to the reviews, unlike me. All the program did was lock up my laptop. Got a black screen and the only way to shut it off was to take out the battery. Then i had to do a system resore to get rid of all the damage it did."
1,cd does not work,this cd worked for a few days then it began when ran to give a dark screen and dispite uninstalling it and reinstalling continued to display a dark screen and not come on i would like a full refund for this product it does not work with windows xp
3,Fun outside the box!,"I love Scrabble and this CD-ROM is in many ways more fun than playing with the family--the computer player never stomps off in a huff when it loses! You can choose a computer player from 6 different skill levels--this allows you to win constantly or really challenge yourself. My only gripe is that the CD-Rom ""takes over"" my computer--it doesn't allow users to minimize the screen to access the Internet or other programs on their computer while Scrabble Complete is open."
3,Fun game but lacking in the dictionary,"This game was a decent buy considering the price, but it seemed to be lacking in the dictionary. The music is decent and the players are pretty good when you turn up the difficulty. It has the ability to tell you which letters are still left to play and will tell you what score you might get for the word you're putting down on the board. However, the game's internal dictionary seems to be either bugged or incomplete. I was playing against 3 computers and the game challenged the word ZONE. I lost a triple word score with the word and I couldn't do anything. Perhaps a bug in the game? Other than this issue, it seems to be worth the money. I didn't have any problems playing the game with Windows XP, Service Pack 2."
5,VERY ADDICTIVE,"Computer Scrabble is not only entertaining but is also educational. It is suitable for people of all ages. It's extremely versatile so you can play at any level you please. It can be played with other players, live or computer, so is great for shut-ins. Beast of all it is very affordable. We play conventional Scrabble but often both are not free at the same time. Score-keeping is automatic which is a definite plus.But you must have spare time because it is extremely addictive."
5,"Scrabble Fun, in a Technology Style Method","This Scrabble game is not very appealing to adults, because they think you ""cheat"" when you press the word suggestions button or hint button. I thing suggestions improve your vocabulary and tell you what words you can make exactly with the tiles you have and the points. The Dictionary is that you type in a word that you want them to define, and they'll define it. Hint is an easier version of suggestions. The rules are the same as the normal Scrabble. And please believe me, even though I'm a kid that this game works on Windows XP."
4,"Scrabble game is fun, but","This edition of Scrabble is fun, but it is more limited than others I've used. There are contradictions, too. For example, the game recognizes some foreign language terms, but not others. I find its dictionary limited and the words you use to play the game are limited to those in the game's dictionary. It is fun to play and incorporates some animations, which adds to its value."
1,not historic fiction - romance and violence,Try Daughter of Venice by Donna Jo Napoli if you want historic/romantic fiction that actually gives you historic insights. The Venetian Mask is just fiction set in historic Venice. Big difference. Rosalind Laker's book is about equivalent to Harlequin Historicals.
2,Faulty design,"It's unfortunate that this otherwise sleek and snug case is marred by one glaring flaw: the clear plastic casing for the QWERTY keyboard does not have an opening for the poweron button. As a result, you are either unable to power on/off your device, or the presure from the plastic casing pushes the button to lock mode. I had to get an exacto knife and cut a rectangle out of the side of the plastic to be able to power on/off the device. Very disappointing."
5,A must have for all die-hard BSB fans!!,"Hey everyone I love the BSB with all of my heart mind and soul. I bought this CD and listened to it the monent I recieved it. There isn't any singing, just an interview but it is really good. You have to turn it up a little and the guy asking the questions is kinda dumb, but it comes with a book full of pictures of the guys, and stuff all about them....I love it soooo ,much and I bet you will too! It makes a great addition to any fans collection!"
5,A Must Have For BSB Fan!,"This is a 40 minute interview with the guys which is really good. They have the fans asking them many questions. It also comes with a 100 page booklet with pictures of them, how they got together, the fans, and about a 10 page biography of each of the guys.This booklet gives lots of information about them that I never knew. It's really great. If you are a fan then you should get this because you'll really like it. BSB Rules! Keep the BSB pride alive! Tiffany"
5,I love this CD!!!!!!!!,"This CD is one of the best I have ever heard. I listen to it all the time, plus the imported CD I have of the Backstreet Boys. I love every one, and I think that the BSB are one of the most talented artists of today."
3,It's ok I guess,"Not something to spend a lot of money on. I haven't even been able to listen to the whole thing it's so long! Plus it's in French in some parts, but the picture book you get kinda makes up for the CD."
3,Coulda been more,"I felt James Caan deserved an A for his portrayal of an incompetent building super & Jen Tilly was good as usual so why only 3 stars? This is a mystery & they do a great job of setting it up early. The longer the story goes on, the less likely the plot that is being revealed is. The final reveal is preposterous. The writer tried to hard on this one & it's a shame. The directorial talent & acting talent were available. The script was sub-par. 2 1/2 stars."
2,What's the point?,"Caan, Bujold, and Tilly. Not a problem.James has the ball and keeps it.Genevieve is crusty and stunning.Jennifer is Jennifer.A somewhat confusing and surreal piece of cinema that manages to progrssively lose your interest. The windup is something that is justifiable for a 40 minute TV movie.No doubt the director had some sense of coordination here but unfortunately it fails to translate.Two stars for the effort."
3,Tilly fan,"fun movie, we get to see some good acting here and jennifer tilly never looked better. I am a huge fan of her, so i am biased."
4,Unique,"This is a very unique movie, if you enjoyed the movie Identity you will enjoy this. If you didn't, at least rent it to check it out...and it's got James Cann!!"
3,The parrots like this pricey feed,"Zupreem is a great parrot food and we feed a lot of it. However, I tried the Avian Entrees Wld and Spicey Bird Food, and the birds ate it. Ok, but they ate the other Zupreem just as well - for a lot less cost. None of the parrots made a fuss when this food was taken out of their diet. Ha, just try to do that with the fruit blend Zupreem. This food is well blended and fortified but it is expensive. I'll feed the other Zupreem parrot foods, thank you."
3,Might have been okay...,My bird just likes a larger sized food. He did eat it but I've been mixing it with a larger seed. He does love the spicy-ness of it.
1,spicy,I was trying to try something you for my birds I purchase this but once I give it to them they will need it for some reason so sometimes these birds I think they want to eat what they used to and of wasting my money and i throw it away
2,Arrived defective,After installing this scanner and seeing it listed on my system as functioning properly I was unable to scan. Any software I tried said that the scanner could not be found and gave me some information and suggestions for my SCSI ports. As this is a USB scanner the references to SCSI were disconcerting. After much seaching I located a couple threads in a newsgroup that the scanner only works on one of the two USB ports. Weird I know but after switching the USB connector to my other USB receptacle it was recognized.Great right? No. The arm wouldn't move and any program I tried said that the scanner was locked. I made sure it was unlocked more than a few times.This scanner is being returned.
2,sandro quiero llenarme de ti vibracion y ritmo,no me gusto este cd ya que en su caratula se anuncian dos canciones en italiano y cuando lo escuche .no aparecen en el cd es una completa mentira no lo recomiendo para que lo compren
5,SANDRO VIBRACION Y RITMO CD,"LA ENTREGA FUE RAPIDA Y EL PRODUCTO EN BUENAS CONDICIONES , LOS TEMAS MARAVILLOSOS , COMO TODOS LOS CD DE NUESTRO GITANO ...GRACIAS !"
3,not the best,"This is not the best of what you can see on cable, but yet, from the available DVDs, it is much better than road rage."
2,not so funny in retrospect,"I remembered this movie as being very funny and when I saw it was available on dvd, I wanted to add it to my collection. Seeing it again, as an older person, and in light of the devastation that violence causes ( and my heightened awareness of it as I've matured), I no longer consider it funny. The part with Dudley Moore being brutalized is not in any way amusing."
1,Not worth the money,"It's no wonder the product description was so sparse. What I got was a small piece of thin plastic the size of the screen and a piece of scotch tape stuck to it. I guess I was supposed to tape this plastic, er the screen protector, onto the screen, but there wasn't even enough tape to keep the plastic on! This is the biggest waste of $18 I've ever spent. There are better, cheaper products out there that are actually worth the money."
2,This is not the one made by Creative Labs,"On the product screen it says Creative Zen Vision:M Screen Protector made by Creative Labs. The one I received today is from Insten and has the sticker iPod Video on it, although both players have the same size screen. I was under the impression that the product was made specifically for the Creative Zen Vision:M"
4,book review,"This book is very philosophical in nature. Silence plays a huge role which allows for the reader's reflection, making it a personal journey not just for the main character, Samba Diallo, but also for the reader. It depicts Samba's struggle in his attempt to balance his past and his beliefs with his future and the modernity that comes with it."
5,Another BOSCH winner.,"As a contractor I buy good tools. I had already purchased the 24 volt Drill, Saw, Light combo so decided to go with the BOSCH cordless miter saw. The way I figure, I got two more batteries an another charger which I needed anyway ... I have used it for trim and cutting cripples on framing jobs. It has worked flawlessly. Some people complain about the dust collector, but it's a tool, it's supposed to make dust. I haven't seen a clean contruction site yet. To me it is not a problem if ever bit of dust doesn't get caught. The carry bag that comes with the saw is okay, but would be better if it were HEAVY duck like the Bucket Boss bags. The plasctic liner gets pretty brittle in cold weather. All in all, I'll never go to a corded miter saw."
3,Not good for the money,"I bought this because I had an eBay intake. Let me tell you, save $200 and buy an eBay intake and not this AEM. it's not worth the money for it. The sound and performace were identical."
5,Very easy reading. Very understandable for the layman.,Very good reading. Easy to understand in order to incorporate the foods into your diet.
2,Crass Shill Reviewers,"This book is moderately serviceable for its intended readers. One wonders, though, to what degree the unethical reviewer behavior clearly linked to the book's editor and publisher infects and damages the overall integrity of this work and its contents. The other Amazon listed reviewers of this book are clearly bald-faced shills. Not content with this, the [...] reviewers go so far as to post phony reviews of competing Congressional handbooks within which they attempt redirect readers to this, their own title. ""Moral issues,"" anyone?"
4,Clymer review,"Overall, this is an excellant repair manual. For those of us that are novice mechanics, there are a few things that could be improved on. My manual was evidently one of the earlier versions. It covered most everything for the ""88"" to ""95"" models. For newer models up through ""2000"", there was an appendix showing the improvements not available in previous years. It required a lot of refering to various chapters just to complete one task. Some diagrams were inaccurate. Otherwise, it was a good manual."
5,great manual,I bought a clymer manual for a previous motorcycle and liked that one so I bought one like it my my new bike and i am very pleased with this one too.
2,These Antennas Don't Last,"My first antenna lasted about a year and a half. My second antenna lasted about a year and a half also. I have a year left on my XM subscription, so I think I'll buy one last antenna."
5,quality set,has all the needed bits to tackle most jobs. I use it for my car which has a number of torx bits on it. works great with a socket adapter
4,Stunning Glasses,Without a doubt these are stunning glasses. So very elegant looking.I'm so glad I purchased 12 at one time as they came in handy at Easter.My Only complaint is I wish they made these Champagne Glasses bigger (held more fluid ounces)They were packed well and all 12 arrived quickly and in excellent condition...matched my wine and water goblets perfectly.
4,Excellent Partyware,"I bought these to use at a Christmas cocktail party at our home-so that we could avoid using our good crystal, and they were perfect! I received several compliments on the flutes. They are good looking and are heavy, appearing of better quality than the price would suggest. They arrived well-packed in bubble wrap, and I look forward to bringing them out for party after party!!"
4,very nice for the price,"I bought these at Macy's in person, and that was the right thing to do. Out of 12 boxes of 4 I managed to pick only 12 flutes that didn't have visible imperfections or scratches. Other than that, they look nice, and you can't beat the price of $9.99 - 12.99 for a set of 4."
1,Poor quality,"Be careful of what you purchase in the Cristal D'Arques line. The brandy snifters are poor quality. I suspect that the remainder of the D'Arques line is on a par with the brandy snifters.I purchased two of the brandy snifters to supplement my Cristal D'Arques collection. We have almost 100 pieces of the various glasses, etc. made by D'Arques and purchased over the years. The manufacturer/supplier is foisting off on the consumer a glass that is 1 1/4 oz. lighter than the original. The original glass weighed 8.50 ounces. The present glass weighs 7.25 ounces. To further insult the customer, the glass appears to be completely molded. The base of the old glass was truly diamond faceted; the new glass has a simply rounded base with fake ""facets"" that have no edges. However, if a purchaser is not accustomed to quality, this would be a CHEAP glass in which to consume CHEAP cognac.Too bad there is not a ""Zero Stars"" option, as that is what the supplier/manufacturer deserves."
2,This item is not crystal,Please realize that this item is not crystal. It is just cut glass. If you are looking for actual crystal please chose a different product.
5,Beautiful Flutes,"I got my glasses and when I opened the box, one was broken. I contacted the seller and they replaced it immediately. The replacement came within a very few days and was fine. All in all, the glasses are wonderful. They are so pretty I hesitate to use them. LOL"
3,An interesting but subjective read...,"The book title tells it all: Ellie Janssen, the author, tells the story of how former husband David became successful as TV's Dr. Kimble during the 1960s. She highlights the factors contributing to the downfall of their marriage, particularly David's drinking and extramarital affairs. If you are a David Janssen or Fugitive fan, this book lends an interesting perspective, along with several rare photos. However, it is understandably subjective, as Ms. Janssen struggles to explain the tumultuous nature of her relationship with David. The book raises some suspicion as to the circumstances surrounding David's untimely death in 1980."
4,interesting,"""David Janssen, My Fugitive"" has been re-released by Michael Phelps (not the Olympic swimmer) and was co-written with Mr. Janssen's first wife Ellie. I remember the television show ""The Fugitive"" from my childhood and enjoyed catching a glimpse of what his life was life before and during that show. I knew that he had died young, but this book doesn't explain much as Ellie was no longer married to David at the time of his death. When reading this book, I can sense that Ellie still loved her ex-husband and it must have been hard to chronicle her relationship with him. It was a nice short trip down memory lane."
1,Forget this book - its a rip off,"This ""book"" is a dis-service to David Janssen. It is poorly written, poorly presented and quite frankly makes no sense. The photographs look like faxed documents - unclear and out of focus. The writing by Janssen's ex-wife is below average; the editing by someone named Michael Phelps is poor and unprofessional. The text serves mostly as a self-serving treatise on the merits of Ellie Janssen; who spends the first two chapters describing her relationship with Frank Sinatra. The book binding is of poor quality - even the type set and text presentation contain numerous errors. Bluntly, this product is a rip-off for David Janssen fans. It looks like it was produced in a garage, then marketed to the gullible. Amazon should be ashamed for offering this ""publication"" for sale. David Janssen deserves a lot better."
1,not worth it,"This definitely isn't worth the money. Some little things, like wrong captions on pictures and other stuff. The book was more about Ellie Janssen, with a lot of name dropping, than David."
5,tijeras aptas para aviones,este producto es ideal para las personas que bordan Porque lo pueden llevar con ellos en los aviones.
3,"Decent, but incomplete","The book's information and descriptions for the trails it has are decent, but it's missing quite a few of them I personally know in the Missoula area. Some of the lesser known trails' omission is forgivable, but not listing Blue Mountain? I mean, come on. That would be like listing attractions in San Diego, and not mentioning the zoo.If you're hoping for an end-all reference encylopedia of Montana trails like I was, this ain't it. But, if you're happy with a rather spotty listing of trails mostly focused around waterways, this is your book."
3,Basic but Useful Guidebook,"Hiking Montana is a basic but useful guidebook. I would have preferred to have the hikes ordered by level of difficulty, or at the very least the hike number listed under each category in the introduction instead of just the hike name."
2,Lithuania: Then & Now,"Although this is definitely too simply written for an adult, it does give a concise overview of Lithuania in less than half an hour. The photography included were good and supported and helped flesh out the overview."
3,"Good non-specific portrayals, some inaccuracies","I picked up this book at an LLL meeting, because I thought it would be a fun thing to share with my kids, given my own current babywearing passion. However, after flipping through it, I wasn't happy with it enough to take it home with me. As a nice overview for kids, showing babies getting carried everywhere by family, it's a cute book. And the back has a section listing little facts about each of the tribal societies pictured in the book. What disappointed me was the lack of carrier names (i.e. Rebozo, MeiTai, Amauti, etc.), and the fact that the Inuit page said that the baby rides in the hood of his mother's parka, which is horribly inaccurate and furthers the view that tribal baby carriers are unsafe and could use modern improvement.Overall, it's a cute book - it was only my perfectionistic, critical side that didn't like it."
4,A compilation of essays on primates,"This is a good reference book for those with a strong background in biology who are interested in primates. The essays are well organized and color photos in the center provide easy reference to some species. However, the language can be difficult to understand. I would not recommend it for someone who is looking for lite reading"
1,Baby-sitter,"Well, I used to babysit a lot and I don't agree with anything written here. I would not buy this book."
4,David Crystal gets right to the point,"the book is especially useful when preparing for an examination, because it gives that kind of information you are looking for, by getting right to the point. Very helpful are the cross-references which can serve as guidelines for further searches. David Crystal gives detailed and exact definitions of the most important terms of linguistics and phonetics, but he neglects some of the key terminology of historical linguistics. Looking for definitions in this field of study, one should rather consult Hartmann / Storck:Dictionary of Language and Linguistics. However, particularly in the field of phonetics and phonology the book is an undefeatable source of information."
4,Useful,"This dictionary is well designed and informative. However, I must admit that I find that theThe Concise Oxford Dictionary of Linguisticsby P. H. Matthews is more likely to have the term I am looking for than this volume. I do not look up many phonetic terms, though, so any deficiency of Matthews in this regard vis a vis Crystal has not been an issue for me.I would recommend that students get Matthews' volume first, if they can't afford both volumes at once. Then get Crystal's book when you can, since more than one dictionary of linguistic terminology is always useful."
1,Crappy holder,"Of course you cannot expect much from $1.25, but don't forget that you have to pay for the shipping as well since this is not shipped from Amazon. I ended up spending $7.2 for this poor quality quarter album (the printed stuff are shifted and it does not look neat), when you can actually spend another $3 at Barnes & Noble for a high quality quarter album with historical information on the back. Some of the slots are so loose that my quarters fell out. I do not recommend this product at all if you want your quarters to have a safe dwelling place."
4,Quarter Album Review,The product met my expectation and was received when promised and in good condition.
2,Pilates for Advanced Everybodies,"I tried this Pilates tape that is supposedly for everybody. Denise is as full of sunshine as she alwasy ever. It gets irritating fast when you realize that you can't begin to do half the stuff she is talking about. I have done Pilates before so I know that Denise is doing advanced positions that could cause beginners to injure themselves. She doesn't even give alternate or adjustment poses too often.If you are advanced don't get this Pilates tape you can do better. If you are a beginner, don't get this tape unless you want to hurt yourself."
1,I really wish I hadn't,"I saw this and thought 'wow! what a Great idea!' I live in a small apartment with minimal kitchen space and thought this would have been a really great idea.. boy oh boy was I wrong.. the blender works okay, but I really wanted it for the food processor and it doesn't even work! I was chopping up some garlic in it and it hit the garlic and stopped.. it couldn't even have the power to chop up a few little pieces of garlic.. sheesh.. what a mistake.. It's only good if you want to spend the money to just have the food processor unit sit on a shelf. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone."
1,Good Grief!!!,"I've heard 747's on take off that are quieter than this thing.You got a few dead relatives you want to talk to? This beast will wake them up far faster than John Edward.And it doesn't even do a very good job.The blender is OK. Problem is, I don't give a !#$#$!! about the blender!"
2,DW0736 doesn't play nice with Laser DW 087,"I ordered the DW 0736 tripod and the DW087 Laser. I didn't read the fine print well enough so I have a tripot with 5/8 inch 11 treaded rod and 1/4 by 20 female tread on the laser. If you order this combination you need to also order and adapter which Dewalt in their infinate wisdon doesn't seem to make. The tripod is nice, just would have been better off buyng a camera tripod."
1,Father MC aint sh**,"back in the day Father made some good joints but he was always so arrogant ( think Kanye before Kanye ) the way he use to say Jodeci was ""his"" back up band and Mary J was ""his"" back up singer. I saw the cat in 94 in concert with Jodeci in germany, dude was drunk as hell couldnt remember his lines, it was pathetic. Jodeci handled their busines though. This album is on some Young Mc type of rhymes, production is wack, dont waste 2 nickels and a dime on this."
5,Father and his kids,Father MC your music may be tight but until you do right by all your children you will Not Prosper. You go out and have kids by different women and just leave them to take care of us yeah this is from one of your kids!! I am nine years old now guess which child I am.

3,GOOD RELEASE,"This was a good release after 4 years off, but No Secrets was a better cd. Everyone needs to Cop It! Father Get At Me Son. Atlanta number is still the same."
4,RIP a very talented cat,"back in the day use to groove to ""taxi"" and his voice was the truth. i mean this cat sounded like Sam Cooke, Bobby Womack with Johnny Taylor thrown in and yet you knew it was his stuff if you followed him. dug the story telling and the directness.this compilation has quite a few of his best cuts and still holds up. he brought alot of soul. very well produced music and i always dug his range. man talk about how radio has changed? back in the day his songs were played alongside whatever else was being played on R&B radio back in the day and also on the Blues station. glad i got to hear his material. RIP"
5,BeBopped into wonder.,"I watched the first two DVDs for the past several months, one after the other. I've enjoyed the adventures of Jet Black and Spike and the adventures they've had. The comedy, the adventure but nothing prepared me for this DVD. It was EXCELLENT. The BeBop crew continue their adventures in space and in life.The first episode had that fractured view of space and reality that has made Bebop a classic. The second and third episodes were the first twopart episodes of the series and unrivaled in their storytelling ability. The last random addition to the crew Ed brings a sense of the surreal to the crew's lives but in a positive kinda way. The series continues to get better and better.While the feature list on the DVD is kinda light, the interviews with the cast and crew behind the scenes make this DVD an enjoyable experience."
1,FAKE CD,"Not only is this CD a very low-quality bootleg, it has several songs on here t.A.T.u never even SANG. The translations in the titles are atrocious, which ought to tip off even impulsive buyers. Not worth one red cent."
3,Dr Pay Allen review,"The DVD has several good points that howewer cannot be understood by people who are not familiar with her work. The subjects touched in DVD are interesting but are not properly addressed. Her recorded seminars are informative and entertaining. Ultimately the conclusion is that for the price of nearly $20 per DVD, one espects better, deeper explanations of the subject. Her teories are proven correct. Not worth the money unless you are in the field of counceling and therapy."
1,not what was advertized,"the ad says leather binding,it is not leather but imitation leather,ad needs to be changed to say imitation leather."
4,Terra Firma,"Although often categorized as bluegrass, Acoustic Syndicate transcends any one genre and is more of a fusion of many styles. As their debut on Sugar Hill, they are moving in a new and refreshing direction with this album with an edgier feel. As others have already said, the addition of Saunders playing the Saxophone really adds more depth and gives it a fully sound. To get a full appreciation of how talented these folks really are, you got to go see them live! Check them out at Spirit of Suwannee Springfest, [...] in beautiful Live Oak, Florida!"
5,Classic,"I am 37 years old and I got this album as a vinyl record when I was probably 5 or six years old and can still remember hearing it play on my little General Electric record player. I have children now and I bought the updated CD version of it and when I played it for my 8 year old daughter, it was like magic. I got to see another generation enjoy this whimsical fantasy. Long before Jurassic park made dinosaurs modern and in vogue, this little album did more to fire my curiosity about dinosaurs. To this day I can still remember ""My name is Brontosaurus, a dinosaur to you. Now that we're introduced, how do you do?"" Or ""How do you talk to a dinosaur, what language do you use? Do you grunt and growl, roar and howl or holler up yoohoo!"" It's as if 30 years hasn't passed by since when I was a kid. I would strongly recommend that any parent who has a young child with an interest in dinosaurs buy this album if it ever becomes available again, you won't regret it!"
4,Missing accessory...,"Ordered and received the Portable Slide-Action Vise from American Tool/... that goes with the workmate bench.Seems to be just what I needed, however, there is a part that is not included in the orginal purchase and is impossible to find.It is the heavy duty ""screw"" that goes through the standard base that attaches it to the workbench! Big part of the whole system. Seems we'll have to ""improvise"" which will not be as good a system as we had hoped for. If you have any information as to how to find this part, or why it wasn't included, please let me know."
1,misinformation,"I bought this with my workmate, on the box it came in shows two bases one standard and the other so you can attach it to your workmate. Looking at the box it seem to say it isn't standard, so I figured that the base it came with can be attached to the workmate was included, it isn't.Another problem is that I can't find anywhere to buy the other base so it can be attached to the workmate.John"
5,Better than a sunnymoon!,VICI is undoubtedly the greatest card game ever!!! Whoever invented it should be recognized by a card game association or someone like that. The game is just brilliant! I'm looking forward to the release of the game's next edition. Will it be available before this summer???
2,Very Disappointed,"Once again i went for this Jig just because of the price, and it's basic function. I was wrong. When i came home to test the jig i could not believe the metal shavings that came out of the jig hole. The when i pulled my wood out of the jig the pilot holes were a mess. I only reccomend this tool for those who like to play around with hobby projects. If you an intermediate to expert woodworker then stay away. The is a reason why the good tools cost more. Go look at the Kreg pocket hole system first.."
2,Not for me.,"I really wanted to like this pocket hole jig. While I thought the Kreg jigs were really cool, I assumed this bare bones jig would be just fine for my purposes. Unfortunately, less than 24 hours after purchasing this, I was on my way back to the store to return it. The drill bit failed on the first use. I ""pumped"" the drill bit in & out to clear the debris like the instructions suggested, but half way into the second hole, ""Snap!"", and she was done. Kreg's similarly priced unit, the R3, is well worth the extra $10. If trying to decide between this and the Kreg R3, its a no-brainer."
2,so-so,"I'd agree with the other negative reviews that this product isn't built to last.For those on here whom had problems with the tip breaking....the instructions do say to pump the drill in and out and dont try and remove all the material at once. The jig is so tight against the wood that is no place for the sawdust to go and you have to help this process along.I paid $27 for this one and a Kreg is $39(for the mid-size) kit. So far, this one has worked okay but I am suspect of the longevity....doesnt seem like it is going to last that long, we'll see. Every time I pump the drill...sawdust comes and out and metal filings from the drill rubbing against the jig.If this one fails me, I will probably purchase a Kreg next time around !"
3,Amatures only,"This is an OK product if you don't plan on using it a whole lot. I found it difficult to set up & less than accurate for ""production"" work. Just fine for occasional use by weekend craftsmen. Practice on scrap before using on your project."
2,Only works once.,"The Bottle Then Dries outs too quickly. But not while your working with it, you have to wait along time for it to work, I was gluing ceramic onto ceramic.They should come up with a better way to preserve the contents before they dry up...waste of money and resources."
2,A very repetitive and unorganized book!!!,"I don't know how this book has 4 1/2 stars on reviews, I really think that the author is more concerned on the number of pages than on explaining XML.I don't deny that the author knows about the topic, but I just think that the deadline to finish the book was too close or that he doesn't knows how to organize his ideas. He starts talking about one thing but then he mentions some property about that and he gives a brief explanation then he says that he will cover it later and then he gives you the same explanation but with a better example.Also, he claims to have a lot of examples but you will find that the examples are just the same, he prefers to write a 50 lines example again and again on the book than just writting the new thing he want to comment.So I really think that the author though that a 1100 pages book would be more attractive to the customers."
4,Exhaustive XML Reference,"This book covers XML in as much depth as any other book on any other subject. If you want to know everything there is to know about XML then this is the book for you. Inside XML starts with the basics and covers EVERYTHING that is XML.I would consider this a complete reference and not a ""Step by Step how-to book"". There are many code samples and these are great. You won't see any step by step ""Tutorial's"". But when you need some explanation or guidance on any xml subject this book is where to find it."
5,"Excellent Reference, good for beginners too","This is the second xml book I read. This books helps me get answers to many questions I got after reading Beginning XML from wrox. This book offers comprehensive coverage of XML technologies and the language is very easy to understand. I use it as a desktop reference. Yet I believe it will be good for users of all levels. If you want one XML book and only one, get Inside XML!"
5,One of the better XML books around,XML can be a rather dry topic. Steve Holzner writes in a style that makes the subject rather interesting. It's the first XML book that I've come across that hasn't sent me to sleep. This book is a great intro into the world of XML. Highly recommended for those looking for a starting point.
2,Wake me when it's over.,"NO, not as great as most are saying. It's a horribly long read. By cutting the useless prattle from this book he could have probably shaved off a good couple hundred pages. I'm kicking myself for not buying o'reilly from the start. The fluff used to pad the chapters should be made into it's own bookInisde Fluff by Steven HolznerYou know the technique you used in high school for that essay that was short a couple pages? Well that skill apparently comes in handy in the real world. Although apparently Steven wasn't allowed to double space and use 15pt fonts."
2,Trys to be everything for everyone,"I have over six years experience in SGML and wanted to find a book that would get me quickly to the nuts and bolts of XML. Aftyer reading the reviews here (yep I know, fatal mistake sometimes) I purchased this book and am disapointed. Too many ingredients in the soup I'm afraid. If you want a fat book that looks impressive on your shelf take mine. This book is trying to be an everything reference and fails."
4,Great for Newbies (to XML and Programming in general),"This book is VERY comprehensive. Holzner literally holds your hand through every single step, which is great if you are totally new XML or even programming in general.However, if you have more than 1 or two years real world experience programing, this book will more than likely just frustrate you on certain levels. The information is still top notch, it's just that the path getting there is very deliberate.See some of the other negative reviews for examples.Still, I think it's a great book."
5,This book is a MUST!,"As a programmer, I am exposed to numerous resource manuals so you can imagine my hesitation when I picked up yet another reference guide. However, much to my suprise ""Inside XML"" is a well written, well devised book, that provides me with detailed, easy-to-understand, and valuable information on XML day-in-and-day-out. This is definitely one of the best-used resources on my desk - and I highly recommend it to anyone who wishes to explore the world of XML further. You can tell a lot of hard work went into the construction of this title - kudos to the publisher and author!"
4,A PHENOMENAL WORK,"Karine Polwart's album Scribbled in Chalk is a phenomenal effort... Hole in the Heart is simply the best pure song I have heard this year; haunting music and words that no matter how many times I hear it, it just gets better.... A combination of a voice that sounds airy and delicate at first but resonates surprisingly strongly when called for; memorable, original melodies crossing over from the folk tradition to contemporary, lilting pop; lyrics that range from wry and insightful storysongs to imaginative poetry to love songs that have grown on me and wormed their way into my being and my every day thoughts so much so that I find myself recalling the album while working or driving.... Isn't that what good modern music and songwriting are all about?"
3,nice photography with limited information,"Filled with some great footage, ""Wild Pacific"" passes off much theory about the Pacific Islands as fact. It leaves out much of the history of other island groups in that area of the Pacific out. Islands which have a much older history than that of the Polynesians. Nevertheless, it is entertaining and contains some great footage.One just needs to be aware that there is much more about the Pacific than this film portrays."
3,Jumpy journey around the South Pacific,"As other reviewers have stated the photography of this Blu-ray disc is spectacular. The inhabitants of many of the locations, to me, provided a different or additional quality to the documentary. The documentary does skip around without obvious direction and as others have stated covers only some of the islands found in the southern part of the Pacific from Hawaii on down. A lot of places are left out. One negative note is tht the last episode is pure propaganda with a major push on so-called global warming. No indication that climate on the earth has gone from cold to hot and back again many times; no indiation as to why; no explanation that man cannot override any of this."
4,Good but not up to my BBC expectations.,"Most of the modern BBC documentary videos I would give a 5 star rating to. This one left me a little disappointment. Filled with beautiful images that leave you with a hunger to go island hoping the the South Pacific, it also leaves you wondering about the rest of the story. Quite a few of the stories feel cut short, like they are about to share some fantastic fact about a creature then they move on to the next story.This film is VERY repetitive. Some of the same foraged used over and over again in each episode. Watching Albatross be eaten by Tiger sharks was interesting and all, but I would prefer new stories to seeing the same images 4 different times. It seemed they were short on footage and were stretching what they had.It is still worth seeing, just be warned it is not up to the standard I have come to expect from BBC."
4,excellent DVD set,"Another one of BBC's ""Wild"" series and it ranks up there with the others. Not quite as expansive as Wild China, and a bit repetitious with some segments appearing twice through the set, which I why I gave it only 4 stars instead of 5. However, this DVD set gives an excellent view into life in and on the Pacific. Because the Pacific is an oceanic realm, much of the photography is underwater. There are also many scenes of bird life which are fascinating. Anyone sensitive to the plight of birds may want to know that, as in nature, many birds meet a ghastly end in these films. And, as in other of the ""Wild"" series, the films touch on the conflict between humans and nature. The last section touches on the future of the ocean and what programs may or may not help secure the future of some of these oceanic species. Highly recommended."
5,Wild Pacific,this DVD has the same as i dit for the dvd Australia the beautiful i only cansay the best i recoment this DVD.Josef Touet
4,Great summer reading,"Summer reading doesn't have to be a chore. This book was required summer reading for my 9th grade communications students at an international school in Korea. While ""required"" might turn some off, I was pleasantly surprised at the novel's readability. It is the poignant memoir of a Korean woman who survived the Japanese occupation and civil war of her country eventually making her way to America to live in California. Her grandaughter tells the story through her grandmother's eyes, and it is truly amazing how provocatively she relates the private wishes, dreams and feelings of this woman of a different era. What is most impressive is the feelings invoked on the reader of the applicability of this woman's story to the nation of Korea as a whole. I hope that the wish related at the end of this fantastic memoir comes true!"
5,a must read,"this is my all time favorite book! for anyone who has ever felt out of place while in their own shoes, Helie Lee can tell you what she did about it....you must read this book!"
3,The story is better than the storytelling,"This novel is based on the true story of how a woman survived the first half of the twentieth century in Korea. Along the way, the reader learns about the history of that tumultuous period, and the difficulties which arose when Korea transitioned into a modern society. The author, however, does not have a good ear for writing believable dialogue. In addition, the abrupt plot transitions feel unrealistic. For instance, the protagonist's rapid conversion to Christianity did not ring true. Nonetheless, the undeniably remarkable story of this woman's life made the novel worth reading."
4,Compelling Story,"Although this book gets off to a weak start, after that it quickly picks up. I picked this book off of the dollar stack at a local book store and was pleasantly surprised. I learned quite a bit about Korean history and enjoyed Lee's interpretation of her grandmother's life story. Also, I see potential. I would like to reed another book by Lee."
5,Still Life With Rice - good story teller,"Although some may question the accuracy of some events, I really enjoyed the way the writer told the story. She brought to life all of the bland text book information concerning the wars and how it was to live through them and what one would remember of them so many years later...how it still affects their lives and their descendents.It inspired me to be brave and ask my grandma about her experiences through these same wars and her way of life and I'm so happy I did as I have gained so much by it. It would never had occurred to me that she had gone through so much pain, and become so strong that I exist today because of it."
4,Heavy subject yet enjoyable reading!,"I love reading about other cultures, preferably via storytelling. If you like to learn about other cultures this way, I highly suggest you read this book. I knew very little about the Korean culture before I read this book; now I'm eager to learn more! (The reason I gave it four stars instead of five is due to some minor editing issues.) However, that can definitely be overlooked!"
4,Enlightened,The book made me wish that I could ask my own grandmother to recall her experiences because I am sure they would be equally interesting. Makes me appreciate the lives of elders who live through so much.
2,Sour Rice,"Koreans have a word for rice that has gone rotten. It's ""shin-bop"" or sour rice. That's what I feel H.Lee has done with her book. In a debut book, she has naively set out to capture the history of her Korean grandmother with very minimal attention to researching the Korean historical background. In more of an endeavor for a mass market ""take-out"" attempt, the book lacks consistency in reference, narrative and most importantly plot development with no regard for literary techique and voice. It's unfortunate because the Korean-American voice in literature has been so weak. Maybe if Lee enrolled in a creative writing program she could be introduced to the ABC's of basic writing which could definitely be to her benefit. As a Korean-American currently working on a Master's degree in Korean History, I could not recommend this book to anyone here... nor in the states."
3,a powerful story that was horribly written,"when i read still life with rice, i couldn't put it down. it was a compelling story. but it is boring as hell to read a second time. lee's book is like a movie that fails to become a classic because there is nothing to appreciate beyond the plot. character development is dull, the story's structure is bland, and lee herself is not very eloquent. i found her transliterations irritating at times, since they tended to exoticize or make koreans look weird. for example, when hongyong screams during labor, and her husband encourages her, she says, ""i apologize for my weakness."" that is plain silly! i could care less about the scathing criticism of historical inaccuacies--helie lee was not trying to write a korean history textbook! this is simply a great book to read once, but it has little value beyond that."
2,bad writing,"It's probably good for stories like this about Korean immigrant grandmothers to be available, but I wish the writing had been better! It's somehow too linear, and it's hard to get a real sense of the characters. Yes, the grandmother is ""a strong woman."" What else is new? The book would have been much better if she had been made complex, with some kind of inner life. She just leaves the baby in the snow, period. She just hates Communists, period. She just becomes a devout Christian, period. And the sandwich bread arrangement with the ""Americanized"" granddaughter bopping around at the beginning and chastened into a ""good Korean"" at the end - whew! Pretty maudlin."
2,Biography with potential,"When I first heard about the book from a friend, I couldn't wait to read it. As a Korean-American female, I had never read a work by another Korean woman and was excited by the praises I had heard. By the middle of the biography, I was too bored to finish it. Some of the stories Lee tells about her grandmother are interesting, but the transitions are weak. I totally agree with the criticism given by Kirkus Reviews. Eventually, I got through the book, but I thought overall, it was underdeveloped."
1,"Bad, bad writing!","I could hardly plow through this book. I guess I should have been tipped off after going to hear Ms. Lee speak - someone asked her what books she liked or had influenced her writing, and she responded ""I hardly ever read books."" It shows."
2,Preachy. Awkward. Koreanized Amy Tan.,"There's little to no indication of literary talent here. But it was an interesting story, and certainly not the worst novel I ever read, so I give it two stars."
3,Out Of Date but Interesting,"The biggest problem this book has is that it was published in 1976. Barcelona as a city has changed & grown, & the context in which this book was written & these pictures were taken is not always the same. That said, it has more factual & conjectural information than most of the coffe-table books one sees in architecture & is quite worth traking down."
5,A fascinating glimpse,Into the inner workings of the Nazi court and the way the German highest echelon was dysfunctional to a degree that should have led to its collapse much sooner.
2,Nothing new in it.,"For those who are familiar with Hitler's story even to a small degree, there is nothing new here."
5,"Awesome, for what it was.","Not a story, but more like a long, well-written history paper based on the forced testimony of two of Hitler's closest aids and written from the Russian point of view (corroded somewhat because it was meant for Stalin's eyes). At the end of the war, the Russians grabbed two of Hitlers lower level assistants; one was a butler and one was an adjutant; and forced them to tell them everything they knew about life with Hitler. The book is even better because the writters help ensure historical integrity by describing why and why not they might have been telling the truth to their Russian captors."
4,True to the book,"I have been to Afghanistan three times (before the Russians invaded) and watched a number of games of buzkashi. The scenes depicted were very accurate. Also, the movie stays true to Joseph Kessel's book. This is one of only three movies I know of that are set in Afghanistan - the others being 'Caravans' (from James Michener's novel) and 'The Beast' (or ""The Beast of War') about a Russian tank crew during their occupation.'The Horsemen' is by far the best movie."
5,This sale was exceptional. They actually gave me more than I paid for,"This movie is hard to find, its a classic and if you never seen it you should its one of those hidden great movies. The acting is great the story line is great.."
5,My favorite Doll Hospital book,"All the Doll Hospital books are wonderfully done, mixing historical fiction with a modern-day storyline. The doll's story is told by Danielle,a doll from a dollhouse that once sat at a boarding school in Paris. But Danielle's story is not so much about her and her doll family but of one little girl at the boarding school, Evette, who is about to be sent away to work in a English factory as she has become orphaned and no one can pay her tuition. Dreamy, magical end! I really wish Ms. Holub would write more of these precious stories."
5,More books pleeeeese !!,I like the Doll Hospitl books. When are there going to be more? Its taking too long. This is the best book so far. If you like funny books with mystery andstuff that happened a long time ago in a cool dollhouse then read this one. Glory's Freedom and Tatiana Comes toAmerica are my second favorites. Tatiana is the first one and it made me cry at the end.Glory is the one that is the funniest in my opinon. I know it takes writers a long time but I am waitng and cant wait for the next doll hospital book. \hurrrrrry up
1,Piece of Garbage,"I bought this item and it arrived in a poorly packaged sleeve (with no label or company name). That was my first indication that something was wrong. The item doesn't turn off when the car is parked so it will drain your battery if you don't remove it (inconvenient). I used it in my car for about 2 - 3 months until it randomly stopped working. As a final ""see ya, sucker!"" move, it blew a fuse in my car (the lighter fuse where it was plugged in) so I had to fix that as well.Don't waste your money. Just use a regular charger at home or find a real website that's selling this model."
5,Outstanding tips on website development,"I'd read the other reviews (thanks, reviewers), and browsed the book, and decided to pick it up. I've read lots of technical books, and must say this is a truly great read - as engrossing as many a novel I've read. Seriously. It's also *the* most useful book I've read on website development - tons of great tips on how to build your website to actually draw traffic, and why. If you have any interest in developing a website that you'd like to have visited, pick up this book."
5,"Should be titled ""Learn how to do SEO correctly!""","Before this book I read many articles online on SEO, and it all seemed muddled, confusing, and contradictory. However, I received a college level education on SEO that made sense. Every one that builds websites must have this book on their shelf! Every college web design program should feature this book in at least one class.My book is well marked up, and then as I read I wrote rewrote all the important data in a notebook so I could pound it into my head.Great Book...mandatory reading!"
4,Worth the assembly time,"I agree with a previous reviewer that the assembly instructions are not step-by-step or geared for the average gardener. If you do not have a good mechanical aptitude, it is still well worth buying this sturdy wheelbarrow and having a wrenchhead friend assist for a half hour or so. The instructions are written for a one-wheel version, so double wheelers have to wing the last few steps. All parts are furnished for BOTH models, strangely, but it only fits together one way and you end up with some hardware for your junk box! Much better than the expensive plastic hopper barrows I was finding at the discount home stores, and should last many seasons."
4,Good Donald Sutherland flick,Donald Sutherland plays this role well. Comparable to Eye of the Needle.
1,A good PC game turned into nothing.,"I played Links LS2000 on PC for many years. Recently I bought this MAC ported version of LS 2000. This program doesn't work. That's just it. I have G4, 1 ghz, 36mb Radeon v.c., and 516 mb ram. My apple excceds all system requirements by far. You can install the 1st CD, but the rest cannot be installed. Program glitch it seems. MacSoft doesn't respond back. So, i guess this program just doesn't work."
1,Not for someone who wants to learn correct pronunciation,"Don't buy this product if you really want to learn correct pronunciation. There are no easy shortcuts to language learning, especially Cantonese! I bought the product, and all it consists of is CD's that have recordings of Cantonese that the listener is supposed to imitate. There's no text at all. Unless you are incredibly competent in tone discrimination, you can learn, at best, to say some phrases that sound like Cantonese."
3,"beautiful looking, but lacking in quality","I ordered three necklaces and paid $4.99 each plus shipping. This one arrived with a broken claw clasp. I can repair it, but was disappointed at the lack of quality."
2,Could have been better...,"This movie could have been better... I do not see how it could be 'authentic' as one viewer described it... I am full blooded Native American and my first complaint obviously is the actor(s).. Why not get some 'authentic' American Indians, as the movie claims to be. I'm probably sure there are many, many American Indian actors and actresses out there, but they probably just get the boot right away cause they're not 'Hollywood' material.Second, is the soundtrack... It is so cheesy and takes me out of the film.. I did not buy it for one second.Third, is the dead wife, Tashina, when the elder has visions of his wife, she is in a ""Christian"" themed vision of her being surrounded by clouds and the sun shining behind her... Please... Don't make me laugh...I could have rated this movie more if it were done better. Oh, by the way, as I mentioned, I am full blooded Native American, so you cannot pass an Asian actor to play a Cheyenne kid..."
1,did NOT like it,"They sure missed the boat because this is a great story, if they would have used real Indians, like David Midthunder and Michael Greyeyes it would have been a real winner but this one I tossed in the garbage. When will people figure out whitemen cannot act like real Indians. Just my lowly opinion."
3,"Authentic-ish Languages, Fake Indians","I blame this movie for the fairytale-like, romance cover, airbrushed Anglofied facial structures & Route 66 postcards I see throughout the southwest.All I can say is, they got the languages right, character interactions all wrong, white person perspective on costuming. Seriously, seriously."
5,A must have,This is a must have film for every family's DVD collection. A true classic that never gets stale with re-telling. To bad there are not more films that can dignify America's First Nations without sugar coating reality!
4,Well Worth It!!!!,The video is better now than it was then. It has been redone digitally and I loved it even more!!!!!!!!!
2,Windwalker,I have no idea how this was downloaded as I did not purchase it nor even looked at it. I like the movie as I have it at home but did not download on my Kindle.
4,Love it,"One of my all time favorite movies. I had been looking for it for years ans was happy to find it on Amazon.com. I am not big on subtitled movies, however, I have no problem with this one. Tells a great story."
4,Great DVD for Native American history/culture,My father loved this in VHS format so we got it in DVD for him for Christmas. I love the fairly accurate Native American thought processes depicted in this movie.
5,"a long wait has ended , the first and still the best movie.","I have waited years for this movie to be relased on video. For the purest, it was the first of it kind and thanks to the Great Spirit we who appreciate small wonders again get a peek into a lifestyle we can only imagine today. Thank you!"
1,Great Movie-POOR quality Video,"This is a great movie noted for the scenic views, However thevisual quality is degraded by the video being recorded in the EP (Extended Play) mode which is totally unnecessary since the movie is only 106 minutes long. What a waste!"
4,very satisfied with my purchase and delivery,I am very satisfied with my purchase and the delivery of the item I will use this company again...
5,One of my favorite movies,In my opinion one of the best movies ever made I can watch it over and over and still enjoy it as much as the first time I saw it.
5,Windwalker,"Always wanted this film, saw it on TV many years ago and have waited to watch it again and record it, or buy it on DVD, which it wasn't available until quity recently.Excellent value, received in good time."
3,WINDWALKER,"My wife enjoyed this film very much. I had a hard time understanding it because I couldn't differentiate between the Indians, probably due to the war paint which made them look alike [ or at least to me]. Maybe if I watch it a few more times I will be able to recognize the individual characters. Still, I enjoy western movies and this is certainly entertaining."
5,Where is the DVD,"I have been waiting for what seems an eternity for the DVD of this movie. Like everyone else who has reviewed it, it is among a very small number of moving, inspiring, and haunting movies. It traverses that narrow ledge between maudlin and mawkish, yet never falls over. I never cry watching movies. I cried."
5,Loved it since the first time.,I first saw this movie on the big screne. It was only showing for one week. I have always loved this movie. My tape is getting old and I would like to buy a new one.
3,Great Movie But...,"This is really a great movie which I saw years ago but I will not buy it at this time. Why, you ask? One simple reason. This is the special edition and it was released in full frame/pan and scan. Why would a special release of a film not contain the original format? It was a theatrical presentation and was presented in widescreen or letterbox so go figure. All I know is that I won't purchase this film until it gets the treatment it deserves and the distributors of the film stop treating the public as if they are idiots. So, unless someone tells you differently that this film contains widescreen on the other side, which it doesn't, don't buy it."
3,"An Average Guide, not the Best","I have both the Fiske Guide to Colleges and the Princeton Review version. The Fiske book focused more on the strength of certain academic programs at the various colleges. I don't know about anyone else, but I'm not certain what I want to study in college-this info really isn't important to me right now.The Princeton Review had a more accurate view of the students social life, conclusions which were reaffirmed when I visited college campuses. I'd buy both books, but the Princeton Review 331 Best Colleges is easier to read, has more information on financial aid and important statistics, and is almost totally based on student surveys."
3,Work great - sort of,Very easy to program with the SC-1000.Don't work well for pets. Leave mine off all the time.However even on high sensitivity they don't seem to pick you up 100% of the time when moving through their sensor range. Would be better if they had a dial for sensitivity adjustment like their vibration sensors do.
3,Poorly described,"Returned the item, not realizing that when I bought it you needed a particular security system to make this work. Also, it took a long time to receive credit back."
3,Vacant property,The skylink audio alarm a433 works very good how ever I am useing itin vacant property and find that the alarm can barely be heard in the far end of a 1000 ft. home I used and extra a 433 audio alarm and may have to get an addition one. Thank You.
4,don't skip it...,"I don't know why, but of the five or so reviews i have seen for this album on Amazon, none of them mention the fact that this CD is really well produced! Even if you don't like the tracks, which are excellent, just check out the mix!! Go on, turn it up, its okay! This CD was made for listening at a higher volume as the mix for the most part is very subtle and deserves closer attention. I find this CD to be just as interesting and absorbing as any other u-ziq CD out there. Bravo to Mike P. for launching into yet another new musical genre and blasting it into the next level!As far as the music itself goes - well, it's 2002, and I still haven't heard anything quite like it, which means that this CD is still innovative, fresh, dancable, funky, and just plain WICKED!!!"
4,A wonderful album,"There are a lot of things in life that people either love or hate. This album is one of them. I happen to love it. It contains hints of Mu-Ziq's signature style, but is different enough to be intriguing. It is more drill'n'bass than drum'n'bass by all accounts, but not so much that you can't listen to the whole album in one sitting. Like most of Mike Paradinas' work, hauting melodies can be found buried in every song. Mike also makes good use of his broad palette of sounds (ranging from electronic, futuristic bleeps to warm, analog jazz samples) to give each track great texture.Urmur Bile is an experimental album, and is different from Mu-Ziq's other works. That said, I think Mike should be praised for not limiting his stylistic boundaries, and for jumping into a whole new music form with so much style and confidence.Well done!"
4,most unlike any other mu-material,"-very different -worth getting -drill and bass much like RDJ album but with Mu-ziq style. -#2,#6,#8 all unbelievable tracks."
1,"blah, bile is right on","this cd is not inventive or creative; the tracks sound like paradinas' efforts at making straight-ahead club tracks that didn't work because he was not inspired. i'm sure he made these tracks in about two hours at the most, and without the aid of a computer which would at least have produced some interesting sounds. many of the repetitive sounds are not only boring but quite annoying. this guy's other material is far better, yes; but so is the material of better artists working within the same general area (as all his stuff, not just this cd of course); such as aphex twin, squarepusher, speedy j, autechre, datach'i...i picked up this cd for $4 in a discount bin, and sold it a couple weeks later. (the obligatory annoying personal story that's in too many of these 'reviews'. true, though)."
5,The Lion in Winter,"Shot on location in France and the British Isles, and based on an excoriating play by Richard Goldman, ""Lion"" is a wit-fueled, magnificently acted parable of power-lust and extreme family dysfunction. O'Toole and Oscar winner Hepburn are superb as the grizzled, sarcastic regent and his cunning wife, locked in a never-ending exchange of venomous criticisms. A youthful Anthony Hopkins, in a spirited turn, pops off some of the best insults. Aside from the endless machinations of various family members, Harvey adds period flavor with authentic costumes and gloomy, tone-perfect settings. When this ""Lion"" roars, you'll be hooked."
5,Most rewarding,"Absolutely excellent. The real purpose for the purchase was to have this great film on DVD. I curently have it on tape and by now it is worn out. Hepburn and O'Toole are exquisite. You feel as though you are right there in the mix of things, and oh what a mix. Would recommend it to everyone."
5,"A wonderful, enjoyable, and accurate portrayal","This film is a spectacular dramatic portrayal of the dynastic squabbles of the Angevins toward the end of Henry II's dynamic but troubled reign. Aside from bringing out one controversial subject (Richard I's possible homosexuality), it also has a poignant, if disturbing, portrayal of the often forgotten and little mentioned middle son, Geoffrey of Brittany (if he had survived the tournament in Paris, there likely would never have been King John!). Topping it off is the humorous and tragic figure of Eleanor (although she did bring a lot of her troubles on herself); and of course, Henry is again marvelously played by Peter O'Toole. As a medievalist, I cannot recommend this enough. Although one should be wary of taking all of it seriously, as with any film production, it is a surprisingly accurate rendition of the period."
2,Whew!,"You think the Sopranos are a tough family? Shoot, they have nothing on this royal bunch! They make the Sopranos look like the Bradys. All the scheming, treachery and the putdowns would make Tony wince. I was struck by the young Anthony Hopkins's resemblance to Russell Crowe, and by the young Timothy Dalton's resemblance to James Bond."
2,Pretentious,"I don't understand how this awful mess got so many rave reviews. It tackles a complicated historical situation with poor cinematography and decent acting jobs of an overblown script. What we end up with is a barrage of every emotion under the sun assaulting us with little rhyme or reason, and no satisfactory conclusion."
2,All over the place,"I think people are mistaking this film's verbose convolutions for quality. The actors do their best with the melodramatic script. The script tries to stay true to a complicated historical situation, but it's difficult to care for any of these wildly inconsistent characters and their blustering emotions. Cinematically, the film has not aged well; frankly, it looks like it was made on the cheap."
3,Lion in winter,From a historical standpoint this film is probably not accurate. I don't think Henry II or Elinor of Aquitaine were even remotely like the portrayals in this film. On the other hand the acting was so good it's hard to find fault with the movie. I would say that as far as being pure entertainment it certainly fits the bill.
3,"""Every family has its ups and downs""","This is one of the witty lines Katherine Hepburn delivers, as she's lying on the ground after one of the many long, dragged out battles with someone...can't remember who. They all hated each other so after a while I lost track.I thoroughly applaud the brilliant acting, the smart script, great photography and even some lovely music. However, watching and listening to three hours of family members scheming and screaming just made me tired. Maybe it was only two hours but it seemed like much much longer. Tacking a ""happy ending"" on after all the psychic bloodshed was really ridiculous.If this is your cup o' tea, then enjoy! Frankly,I can think of much better uses for this great cast."
5,I haven't seen it but...,"The West Wing's POTUS Bartlet & Toby quote from the film in a season three episode:""Geoffrey says, 'You fool! As if it matters how a man falls down.' And Richard says, 'When the fall's all that's left, it matters a great deal.'""It's Bartlet's favourite movie - recommendation enough for me."
5,"The Cat's Meow, so to say...","In virtually every respect, this is one of the great films of all time. Katherine Hepburn and Peter O'Toole are magnificent. The whole venture is photographed stunningly with every creepy medieval gargoyle and dark corner in sharp relief. The screenplay, notwithstanding its historical basis, is pure Edward Albee - but with so much more class. Recommended absolutely without reservation.WARNING: A thorough command of English, and the intellectual capacity to follow the twists and turns of plot are essentials. No brain dead special effects, or action here. In fact there's almost no ""action"" at all! (It takes place in the mind - and what better place for real drama than that?)"
4,Mikes picks,Amazing how good the older productions were with actors and not special effects. Truly a great film
4,Henry II and his relations,"Movies like this always make me think ""wouldn't it just have been easier to have elections?""With that being said, the Lion in Winter revolves around Henry II working out the succession to the crown with his surviving three sons, the King of France and Henry's wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine. John (the Prince John of the Robin Hood stories) is a slob and not that bright, Geoffrey feels unappreciated and Richard (later known as Richard the Lionhearted) has problems all his own. King Louis of France feels as if he has been slighted and Eleanor has plots and schemes of her own. All of it serves for some interesting drama.Katherine Hepburn's performance is excellent and Peter O'Toole's portrayal of Henry II is just as good here as it was in Beckett, one of my favorite films. This is a first-class movie and one I strongly recommend."
2,"Lions Tigers and Bears, oh my!",This movie has a nasty climax where a graphic verbal description of a previous child molestation event took place. I'd like to see historical proof that this occurred. The rising motion of the plot is generated by the many secret deals made between members of the same family in an effort to gain the edge that will ensure their selfishly motivated power grab. Personally I think a classic is defined by a plot that demonstrates the beauty and goodness of people who prevail against overwhelming odds. This is just a family feud with nothing good to recommend it.
1,talk talk talk ...,"This movie is impossible to watch. It's embarassingly melodramatic, running at full volume, no doubt to hide its lack of structure. The characters are always making anachronistic historical points. Its obsession with royal issues would give even the british press a headache. But worst of all -- the incredibly pointless, endless and unpretty scenery shots. No, that's not the worst part -- I forgot the fact that these are the worst performances imaginable by these actors. I've never seen Anthony Hopkins this bad. Or Peter O'Toole so over-the-top. Or Katherine Hepburn so desperately asking herself ""how am I going to make this interesting?"" This pseudo-psycho-history holds up so badly and seems so unreal today, that it will be completely forgotten 20 years hence and good riddance. [Sappy] poetic obsessions with cartoon historical figures have seen their last days, I hope, I hope ..."
5,Historical Soap Opera that is Flawless,"Pound for pound and line by line, this film has the best dialogue this side of ""All About Eve."" Katherine Hepburn and Peter O'Toole are delicious as they trade barbs with each other in this supremely-acted flick. With Anthony Hopkins heading the supporting cast as one of the couple's sons, this is one truly dysfunctional family.The Ewings of ""Dallas"" and the Colbys of ""Dynasty"" have nothing on Richard and Eleanor.Kate should have singlehandedly won the Oscar.Sorry, Babs, but this was the ONE outstanding acting job of 1968."
5,How about EVERLASTING Peace?,"This is probably the best script ever written from a dialogue standpoint. I don't understand how tha 'Toole got passed over for the Oscar. Hepburn does her thing (which of course means being the best actress the world) and the overall casting is brilliant. The action scenes are pretty lame, but I doubt that anyone really cares. This film is very historically accurate and sort of makes you wonder why anything like Gladiator would ever get made much less win Oscars. Another good take on dysfunctional families is ""The House of Yes"" which has nearly as good dialogue and solid performances. Also check out ""Happiness"" by Todd Solenz if you can stomach it. I'm not sure how much of the original play made it into the screenplay, but the final product is genious to a level that I can't even comprehend."
5,a true classic!!,"If you love sharp verbal jabs, this is your movie! Wit abounds and the cast is second to none. Dialogue is quick and cutting. The setting is completely authentic. I can't say enough good things about it!"
5,The Lion in Winter,"Wow! Even if it's a fictionalized presentation of actual events, film is all consuming with the vicious infighting for power and, am at a loss for words! It's utterly fascinating."
5,A Truly Great Film,This is a great film with unforgettable performances -- a classic by any definition. You can't really compare it to the drek that normally released as a movie today. Do yourself a tremendous favor and buy it!
4,Start to finish great performances.,"Great storyline. Untoppable Performances. I keep buying copies, because my friends keep making off with them. This one dosn't dissapoint."
4,Royal Disfunctional Family,Exceptional performances of royal family intriques and betrayals. The double and triple crosses are both tragic and comedic. No one can be trusted. This is a drama borne upon words. It is an intelligent person's film. Not for those mezmerized by bloodletting and carnage action films.
5,Best Source of One-Liners in Hollywood,"For many years my three nieces, aged sixteen to twenty-two, and I have thrilled to this perfect portrait of the ultimate dysfunctional family. The acting is breath-taking and the reparte is over-the-top. Since their early teens my nieces have been able to quote all of the best lines (with English accent, of course) from the movie. Since it's a family tradition now, rather than check it out again I'm going to buy a copy so we can enjoy it forever! Thanks Amazon!"
5,great picture painted by outstanding actors,"if you're ""movie-quote-guy"" with your buddies, this is one you should see - right away!Peter O'Toole is ferocious, evil, powerful and strong. Hepburn is shrewish and cunning - the words ""feminine wiles"" come to mind.Drama and thoughtful introspection as presented by a capital group of talented individuals.You gotta see this picture"
5,The Lion in Winter,Received in good order in very short period of time. I'm impressed with the quick service for this old film.
5,Fabulous Performances,This is one program I really don't care how historically accurate it is - Katharine Hepburn and Peter O'Toole are such a joy to watch.
5,The supplies are available....,A fine product for upholstery and framing. The TR200 uses both Stanley Sharpshooter TRA and Arrow T-50 supplies.I searched Google using Sharpshooter TRA and located suppliers for the Stanley fasteners.I searched Google using Arrow T-50 and found several suppliers of fasteners. My local Home Depot has Arrow T-50 staples that worked just fine.
2,Stanley ProSharp Shooter Broke in one year.,I bought a Stanley ProSharp Shooter TR200. And with in one year it broke. I don't use it that much so I would like to know if someone has had that problem. And if you can tell me who to contact on line to have it repaired. Thank You Jack
2,What happened to the B Side?,"The Chemical Brothers have put some cool tunes on this. Block Rockin' Beats has become some sort of anthem, Electrobank is pretty good (if a little American), and Setting Sun is just too cool for words. But when you flip the tape over, it's absolute junk! Nothing but a bunch of barely memorable, noisy, repetitive 'tunes' that aren't worth a second listening. Prodigy's Fat of the Land is a lot better than this."
2,Not great...,"ok, so i bought the album cause it was nominated for a grammy or something, and i thought chemical brothers' ""surrender"" was pretty good-- but then i realized this was a mistake. Really, the only good song on this album is 'Block rockin beats'. the others are occasionally interesting, but they're just not all that good. its like they started playing with the synth and werent really concentrating on producing a good piece of music."
4,Techno's breakthrough,"I'm not much of a dance/techno fan. Some ambiant stuff is really good, but dance stuff for me tends to get dull fast. However, this album simply rocks! The beats are fat and heavy, the music & loops swirl & soar forward nearly as much as they look back. The kitchen sink approach here is remarkable. All tracks are good here, from ""Block Rockin' Beats"" to ""Setting Sun"" to ""It Doesn't Matter"". But nothing can compare with ""The Private Psychedelic Reel"", the album's closer. As much a 60's trip out as a 90's trance mix with banging bass & drums, it's stunning in it's depth & breadth. If nothing else, this track justifies the purchase alone.This album boosted my respect of techno music & it's creators tenfold. A great leap forward as much as a nice look backward. And you WILL dance; it cannot be denied. Free your mind & your butt will follow."
4,four and 1/2 stars.,"this is busy music. when i listened to it yesterday it was definitely on the move, off to somewhere. probably a party, judging from the sound of things. parents should keep this cd away from their children. kids might hear this thing and decide that a life devoted to keeping the stock market afloat is not a life at all. corporate profits might suddenly seem silly. the bottom line might be twisted into the bass line. conservative principles could be overturned in impressionable minds. all that could happen. it really could. so, if you are an adult and can keep your cool, then buy this. it's good stuff. just hide it from the kids."
5,"Opus of trance/house/dance/etc, etc","This is defenitely the album that revitalized the current dance craze. This is an album that (while it doesnt convey a deep story) is meant to be listened to in one setting, as the tunes within weave an awesome album, and one that will be in your stereo for a long time. If you like techno, this would be a a sure fire bet. Songs like ""Block Rockin' Beats"" REALLY ,make you want to listen from start to finish. Great album!"
3,bor-ing,"S'allright. I bought this cd a couple months ago and listened for a bout a week. It grew on me, but it is a bit too repetitive with not enough variance and hard beats. If you want a good rock/dance cd get the crystal method's album Vegas!"
1,Timeless,"After shedding out the dough to buy this thing I ended up trying in vain to take it back. This record is timeless, im pretty sure that twenty years from now no one will ever deny purchasing it back in the 90's the same way that most people never deny purchasing all those disco albums."
5,ChemBros Electrify Minds with Killer Sounds and Synthesizers,"Pop in the CD and hold on. The Chemical Brothers deliver funky beats and sounds that'll have you hitting the repeat button on every song. A mix of knowledge of electronica and use of machines make the Chemical Brothers leader of this music genre, and the proof is in ""Dig Your Own Hole."" Be sure to check out Block Rockin' Beats, Elektrobank, and Setting Sun which features Noel Gallagher from Oasis with vocals. A definite mind warping, pyschedelic groove for any electronica freak."
3,Sort of Runs Out of Steam,"I'm not a huge electronic (or whatever) fan, but I'm not above trying out several albums. Unfortunately, it seems, to me anyhow, dance music is best listened to via singles and compilations rather than single-artist albums. This album starts out quite strong with ""Block Rockin' Beats"" and the rather interesting title track. I found ""Elektrobank"" (what's that? an ATM?) interesting but too long, but ""Piku"" and ""Setting Sun"" restored my interest. After that point, my attention level begins to waver - nothing else on the album (except maybe ""Where DO I Begin"") is as captivating as the earlier items. With titles like ""Don't Stop the Rock"" and ""Get Up On It Like This"", I suppose it's no wonder. Perhaps more hardcore dance freaks will find this more interesting than I do."
5,The standard for electronica,"This album got me and all my friends hooked on electronica. It gets my vote for best CD ever. None of the tracks are even remotely close to sucking, they all kick. Play this CD in your car, play it loud. Play it on headphones and let your mind wander. Listen to it twice and you'll NEVER put it back in its case.Perfect blend of rock, big beats, quasi-robotic-trip-hop-funk or whatever you want to call it. If you don't have an open ear or u just don't like music then don't bother with this CD. This is an acid trip without the acid."
2,A bit monotonous?(correct spelling?),"This cd is ok, but it is pathetic compared to EPD and BGWIO. Songs such as ""it doesn`t matter"" and don`t stop the rock"" get very very very repetitive, unfortunately I have to brand this cd as ""repetitive techno garbage!"""
3,"Cool, but i have heard better.","I think it's a good cd, it sold well and Chemical Brothers had their international breakthrough, but too be honest i have heard alot of their ""new wave"" stuff before and i have heard alot better too, it's not that this was a brakthrough for techno music just becauase the album became a success. ""Block Rockin beats"" and ""Setting sun"" are the great numbers from this album, but it also includes a couple of other good ones's such as ""Piku"" ""Electrobank"" and ""Get Up On It Like this"". ""Where so i begin"" is quite odd, sound like it's taken from another group's Cd, it's slow with a female's voice. I do think you should take a look at this cd if you're into this kind of music, but don't let the critics fool you cause their are many other dance albums that are alot better."
2,Dissapointing,"I was extremely dissapointed by this album. Many of the tracks are weak at best, and I can't name a single song that stands out from the rest.Instead, I suggest ""Exit Planet Dust"" or The Crystal Method's ""Vegas"" instead. This album, as far as I'm concerned, is simply not worth the money."
3,dig your own hole,"Exit Planet Dust had grace, style, and originality. I find this album much too repetitive, barbaric, and frankly, at times, plain annoying.Apart from the hit ""setting Sun"" which is reminiscent of the Chemicals first album, the rest is just constant ""boom boom"", noise with no particular creativity.I think this is what the Brothers had in mind for Dig Your Own Hole. Instead of actually doing an album with songs, they thought of giving you their ""live"" sound as if they were mixing non-stop beats for about an hour on the radio.No doubt, hardcore party people will ""dig"" this."
2,NOT VERY GOOD,"I was very disapointed with this CD. After the great ""Exit Planet Dust"", I was expecting something at least as good. However, ""Dig Your Own Hole"" has only a couple good songs. The rest I would discribe as filler. Get Crystal Method's ""Vegas"" instead."
4,it moves.,"chemical brothers are awesome.this type of music is electrical.callit techno,trance,ambient or electronic,it moves.alot of new york radio is catching this groove on late saturday nights."
4,a great CD....,"I'm listening to this CD as I'm typing this. All I can say is that there's more to the Chemical Brothers than just ""block rockin' beats""! Can't wait for their new one to come out this summer!"
3,Good - but too hard for small dogs,"I have small dogs and one of these treats is far too large for them. Plus the one smaller dog doesn't have the jaws to even break through these since they are too hard. We broke some apart by banging on it with a the end of scissors and they seemed to really like the taste. But they are too much work to purchase again. I am happy that they seemed to love a low fat treat - but if you have small dogs - you may want to get these instead:Old Mother Hubbard Mother's Solutions Snacks for Dogs Soft and Chewy 5 Calorie, 6-Ounce Pouch"
3,Skinner's Mission,"There is a certain sameness to the Skinner novels although they do have nice plot twists. I thought this one was rather contrived, but I would recommend it for Skinner fans."
5,Love it,"I Love it. The sizing was perfect. The fabric seems durable, and I couldn't have hoped for more. I have had many compliments on it and it's my go to swearshirt for cool days."
5,The Thank You Book for Kids,"A great big THANK YOU to Ali Spizman for taking the time to remind all of us the importance of saying ""Thank you"". Being an elementary school librarian, I originally bought this book as a reference for my students. I soon found, however, that it was a great inspiration to me personally. Ali includes a tremendous variety of clever ways to make the often dull task of writing thank-you notes into an exciting exercise in creativity. This book should be required reading for all ages!"
5,An authoritative work on this image from Heaven,"The story and the image of Our Lady of Guadalupe has fascinated the world since it first appeared on Juan Diego's tilma.This book brings together the image's foremost experts to explain the miracles of the image: how such a detailed image was created on material as coarse as wool, the image seen in Mary's eyes, the symbolism in the image, and the results of scientific studies of the image.The book also re-tells the beautiful story of Juan Diego and Mary's words to him.The book contains many color illustrations."
4,Guadalupe is Amazing,"A Handbook on Guadalupe is an interesting take on the miracle of Our Lady of Guadalupe that took place in Mexico. This title goes through a variety of information regarding OL of Guadalupe such as the miracles, Juan Diego, the area she appeared within, and many other inspirations that she created. This book is good but at some times the writing style by the variety of theologians can seen dull and hard to stay interested. This book would have been much better with an easier to read layout and a variety of different authors such as more everyday people, or those that live in the area of Mexico where in the past Guadalupe appeared. All in All this book is a great start on learning about Guadalupe but at times can be difficult to read."
2,Unbiased Love for the Virgin of Guadalupe,"This book was totally biased! For one, the authors are all theologians or participants in the Catholic faith and second, they favor Eurocentric thought. The Virgin cannot be spoken about from a Eurocentric perspective alone for she is a symbol of mixed identity, that of Indigenous and Spanish/European ancestry.My advice to anyone interested in learning about the Virgin from a holistic perspective would be for him/her to read other books in addition to this one."
3,what i paid for,"it is only a poster , but it is cool as hell . big selection and good service ...great for the price , but i was looking for better quality . again ---- it's only a poster ."
5,Beautiful black and white,"This is a beautiful black and white poster print. I wish it was a bit larger, though. It would go well in a bathroom or kitchen, but is too small to stand alone in a living room or bedroom."
1,"Yes, piece of Junk indeed","My Razr started to play funny games on me. Seems like sometimes it refuses to charge my batteries...So I decided to buy something extra to charge the batteries without the phone...It worked once and then died... Apparently the power adapter died after about 24 hours...I tried another adapter and if it lights the unit, no charging is happening...I already disposed of the wrapping so I cannot even send it back... I lost 20$ plus shipping for this PIECE OF JUNK!Is it visible I am not happy at all?"
3,Works for me!,"I bought this device when the charger that came with my phone stopped working. Works great, no problems. I like that you can charge the phone and your spare battery at the same time, and it's also a stand for the phone. Makes my desk a little less cluttered. I just need it to last a couple of months until the iPhone comes out....."
5,Witty and Funny Childrens Book,"Parents and children will be amused with this book. My 3 year old makes us read it to her daily...for months now! It has a lot of dimensions to the book and can be fun, silly and enjoyed by children of all ages. I recommend buying a donut plush along with it for a real ""doughnut-dog"" experience! hahah"
4,Arnie is good but not great!,"Arnie the doughnut realizes doughnuts are destined to be eaten; however, he is determined to convince Mr. Bing, the man who purchased him from the bakery, that he should not eat him. The two become friends and finally agree to form a ""Man's best friend"" sort of a relationship and it is rather endearing. My daughters 3 and 5 laughed out loud, but you should note that my girls also loveDog Breath!: Horrible Trouble With Hally Tosis (Dog Breath)andWalter The Farting Dog: Banned From the Beach (Walter the Farting Dog). The illustrations are very unique and the humor is a bit over-the-top for children's book, but somehow the whole story works. It is a good book for encouraging your kids to make predictions, and it certainly promotes a wild imagination. Arnie the Doughnut is good but not great. Definitely worth reading, but I would recommend checking it out of your library and spending your money somewhere else on Amazon."
5,Delightfully funny story....don't eat me!!,"My six year old daughter Serenity, really enjoyed this humorous tale, about , what else...doughnuts! She is a fond Dunkin Doughnut fan, well, I think she is a bit biased, but loves the tale. It really is a very cute entertaining story. And, she watched the cartoon on TV the other day and was reminded how good the story, and book, is. A great addition to any pre-school / kindergarten's library."
2,Not what you're hoping for,"To call this a Busby Berkley disc is almost fraud. It consists mostly of song and dance routines of that era, usually by Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler, who's voices and dancing talent are marginal by todays standards. The amount of Busby Berkley ""spectactulars"" is about 15%. A major disappointment!"
5,"Do I do, or do I don't",I had orginally ordered the bound book with music and words. When I received this small paperback boolket I was some what upset! After looking thru I decided to keep it sust to have the worda to all the songs. It's O.K.
5,The Case of the Frozen Addicts,I have not read the entire book yet -- but the condition was exactly as listed on Amazon when I received it via mail.
5,"Gundam Wing, great anime","Gundam wing is one of the greatest anime's ever. It is definitely a must buy. It starts out with 5 Mobile Suits, made out of Gundanium alloy, hence the name Gundam. These 5 suits have pilots, their names are Heero, Duo, Katra, Troa, and Wufei. This video is somewhat violent, so I suggest this to older viewers (12 and over). This is a great break from some other animes. For example i watch Dragon Ball Z, Sailor Moon, Tekkamen Blade, Fushigi Yugi, etc... This is most different in a good way, so please, if you are an anime fan, purchase this video. By the way, wanna chat or talk about anime? E-mail me at mike_ferrin@hotmail.com"
5,"Mobile Suits, Gundams, the Alliance, OH MY!","Action, drama, and a whole lotta a** kicking! That pretty much sums up Gundam Wing. Though the first episode isn't all that interesting, hang in there, it gets good. Gundam Wing is quite possibly the best thing that's ever happened to anime since the pencil.The kids are gonna love this one....."
5,an anime for non-anime lovers,"I knew this anime was for me when i saw it first on cartoon network. i thought, ""ok, this is cool, maybe i should get into something besides Pokemon..."" because i'm one of the biggest pokemon fan u'll ever meet. well, anyways, i was started to get into this gundam wing thing, and i told my friend, and now she's REALLY into it! her fav. person is Heero Yuy and mine is: Quatre! He is 2 cute! I got operation 1 for DVD, and it is great! you can change the subtitles, and the langage and stuff. i would want anyone to but this! it's got great eps. and graghics, and unlike the cartoon on CN, it is uncut: that means they swear more, and there is more blood and stuff. it doesn't really affect the content, but i don't think it is suitable for kids under 12. have fun!"
5,I do belive this is quite good,"This is quite good. In my eyes, this is this best series out of all of them. I mus say, everything is gorgous. I was hooked immedtially. (the cool one is Trowa)If you can't decide to get it or not, you might as well get it. I am quite sure you won't be sorry."
2,Gundam Series,"The Gundam Wing series is probably the best of all the Mobile Suit Gundam series, that originated back in 1979. The series is based around giant mecha(mobile suits), and the five gundam pilots who are trying to defeat the political organization OZ, run by Tres Kushrenada. Over time eras change and the plot becomes more involved. Though the show might not be appropriate for children under about 7 or 9 yrs old, it is a complex, deep political series with a lot of twists and turns in the plot. For any anime fan, this is a must see, especcially if you enjoy action that never ceases. It deals a lot with morals and death, connected with mobile suits and guns and stuff. For more information on Gundam Wing and more anime, check out my site [sakurasplace]."
3,Seen the entire series,"Not the best of the Gundam series, that honor would go to Zeta Gundam or Stardust Memories. However it's a decent intro to the Gundam series if you like pretty looking teenage boys (I however do not...). This series easily could have lost 10 or so episodes and been a lot better. The mecha designs are decent the Tallgeese and the Wing Zero are two of the best designs of the series. You all should know this series runs about 49 episodes and really doesnt end with 49. There is another 3-part OVA called Endless waltz that finishes (somewhat anti-climactically) the series.But the kids should love it..."
5,LOVE IT LOVE IT,I Recomend this without a doubt. The Sole reason I bought a DVD player and I know that My money was'nt waisted I tried and tried to get a hold of the Subtitled and later found out that it was only on DVD and I had to buy it so I could hear my Hee-chan ( Hikaru Midorikawa -san or chan ^_^) talk because there is nothing better then hearing Heero saying I will kill you in Japanese or hearing Duo scream Watashi wa Shinigami ! worth all the money you put in it
2,Gundam WIng is a sellout of the original spirit of Gundam!,"I think anypone who has seen the original and the Z,ZZ and Char's COunterattack will agree that Gundam WIng is a sellout of the original spirit of what makes Gundam so great. Gundam Wing is more the flair of Power Rangers -- invincible, color-schemed, good looking young men who are basically one dimensional characters. Gundam Wing may have been good nuff as a standalone series, but it really shoudlnt be included as a Gundam series. That is just wrong. It does injustice to the rest of the Gundam saga. If you want real GUndam, see 0083 Stardust memory or 8th Platoon. NOW THOSE ARE WHAT GUNDAMS ARE ALL ABOUT!!"
5,Excellent!,I think this one great! It is the very first one in the series. It tells why there are Gundam suits and so forth. You will love it if you love Gundam wing.
2,one of the worst moblie suit gundam series,I saw this series about 2 years ago all 49 ep's and all 3 oav's and this series isnot oringal its storie is taken from past gundam series.This is one of Yoshiyuki Tomino's worst gundam series if you wan t a good gundma series buy stardust memories.
5,Best Anime Yet,"Gundam Wing is one of the better anime series shown in the US,the characters are great,the plot is about as interesting as dubs go and plenty of violence and action to keep you at the edge of your seat,one thing that bugs me though is that Wufei(shenlong gundam's pilot) is stereotypical sometimes,other than that thing this is a must-buy(or at least see)for anime fans,but caution to young viewers cuz'this anime contains some violence and language,but nothing serious.This anime pleases both genders because of ""boyish"" action and girl pleasing cute teenage guys and character drama."
3,Confusing but cool,"I gave this a try because of pressure from some friends. I will admit that I am not a huge anime fan, but I am now a Gundam Wing fan for sure. But I didn't start understanding the story until volume 2 (the 2nd DVD in the series). The apparent large plot holes were finally filled in by the second disc. So if you enjoy this disc but were confused, give the next volume a try before you finally decide. Great animation, and a surprisingly good story as well."
5,A Great Start To A Great Series,"Gundam Wing is one of the best anime television series out there, and the series comes off with a great start in these early 5 episodes. In the first episode, 5 mysterious Mobile Suits are sent to earth. Four of them reach earth safely, but 1 is seen in the atmosphere by a military aircraft. The Mobile Suit is shot down and crashes into the sea below. How will the pilot of this Mobile Suit, the mysterious Heero Yuy, recover his suit? What will he do about Relena, the girl who witnessed the event? And how will he deal with characters like Zechs Marquise who are trying to get his Mobile Suit for themselves? You'll have to watch to find out. This is just one of the many storylines introduced in the first 5 episodes, soon to explode into a huge complex series."
1,Not Very Good,"I was pretty disappointed with Mobile Suit Gundam Wing - Operation 1. The animation was good, but nothing spectacular. The story a major disappointment. Hard to follow and didn't make much sense."
1,The worst gundam series,"This is not a very good gundam series. The storyline is unconvincing and badly written. If you want a good gundam series, check out G Gundam or Turn A Gundam"
5,Awesome,"I love this CD. Inspiring lyrics, great beats, awesome singing -- what more could you need?? Buy it, and you'll LOVE it!!My favorites are ""Glorietta"" and ""Closer to Closure""."
4,Impresive,"When I first heard these guys on www.purevolume.com I though they were pretty sweet. Then they really started to grow on me, also when I found out they were a Christian band, I was so stoked to get there CD, They are so sweet, the singer has very good vocal range and the band has very ""Impresive"" music! Who knows, maybe i will give it 5 stars later!?"
2,These guys need some work,"I was pretty dissapointed when I heard the Mourning September album. I guess my problem was that my expectations were so high, coming from an album put out on Floodgate, and produced by James Paul Wisner.Wisner did a flawless job, the problem was that he worked on a flawed album. Ultimately by the fourth track, you've heard every song on the album. There aren't really any hooks in the album, and because of that, every song ends up sounding exactly the same.Maybe their sophmore effort will prove me wrong, but for now this is a band you probably shouldn't invest your time and money into."
2,Ouuch.. I would wait for the next edition,Not well thought through. A bunch of typos and errors in the examples. I would definitely wait for the next edition. Even after that.. just like others have said.. not well organized and not detailed. Lets not repeat ourselves.One good thing -- provides a high level introduction and some exposure to XML and how it is used with Java. Thus the second star !!
2,The comments are for Ch5 and Ch6 only,"I could see that the authors really understand the subject XML. However, they assume that readers also understand quite a lot about this subject. They simply could not explain concepts clearly. Their explainations of concepts are like concepts themselves, which may be even more difficult. This book definitely should not be the first book to read for anybody to learn XML."
2,A classic example -- unfortunately,"This book has a misleading title and a misleading objective. Unfortunately this has become common in many IT books. There are some good ideas here and there, but at the end of the day the reader is left with little of what he/she wanted and with many better options elsewhere."
1,Very misleading and confusing book,"This is a very misleading and confusing book about XML. I would have given this book ""0"" stars."
2,Not practical,"I love the idea of this book. Show the evolution of a framework and show an increasingly complex system evolve. Give the user the code and let them work along.But the execution of the concept is terrible. I have had to tinker with even the examples from chapters 2 and 3 to get them to run at all. I'll admit that the authors picked a daunting task. Just getting the Servlet engine, JSP engine, the personal web server and the ODBC database connections would stop most readers cold. After stuggling with that, I had little patience to debug their code. The Wrox site tells you to see ""the errata"", but I can't find this.And one thing I'm still struggling to learn or even find out if it exists - decent debugging tools and techniques for Servlets. I feel like I'm back in the 70's, what with my command line and worrying about environment space and variables. God but I wish I could step through this code rather than sprinkle it with the author's own ""Logger"" statements."
1,Professional Java XML Programming with servlets and JSP,"If your'e looking to gain insight into integrating XML into Java programing, this is not the book. The authors spend far too much time showing simple code examples and reviewing regular expression syntax. The JSP and servlet info is rudimentary at best and could only be expected to be used as a starting point for this type of programming. As far as XML is concerned, this book teaches only the bare bones."
1,Very Confusing Book,"I am a professional programmer with a background in C++ Windows programming who started learning JAVA a year ago. I bought this book with the intention of learning how to leverage XML in JAVA apps and servlets. I made it through the first chapter just fine and then all heck broke loose. I could not get the examples to work, the text became as clear as mud and I had to put the book down in disgust because every other chapter in the book lynchpins on knowledge from the previous one. This would not be a good buy in my humble opinion."
2,"Quite a bad book, really.","I think this isn't a very good obok. First, it's not written in a very clear way, I simply didn't understand everything in the book. However, the biggest reason not to buy this book, YOU HAVE TO READ ALL/MOST OF THE CHAPTERS TO UNDERSTAND PARTS. Why is that bad? Many people, including me, like to read only relevant chapters. For example, if you already know some of the stuff, you skip directly to the right chapter and read from there. You can't really do it here, since the authors create lots of classes they constantly use in later chapters. Thus, it makes the book terribly inconvenient. Maybe this is only my impression, I didn't read all of the book, but after a few chapters that I found myself reading stuff I *DIDN'T WANT TO READ*, I just abandoned this book and moved to another one."
2,Examples Difficult to set up,The book contains a lot of useful information but since everything is very interconnected you can't really read just the parts that are of interest to you. Getting the environment set up to run their examples is also horribly difficult. I'm a fairly knowledgable server-side Java programmer yet I was unable to get their example systems configured and working after several wasted hours of tinkering. Better setup documentation is crucial.
3,This is not for beginners,"This book appeared to be started with the intention of being a primer on Framework development. (For example there are references to a chapter on UML and Patterns that never appeared).The usefullness of this book is highly dependant on the role you wish to play in your future projects. If you are trying to get your first gig as a Java developer get another book.If you are a fairly seasoned developer and want to move into an architecture role, this book is a fairly good example of the forces which drive modern application development.It also provides insight into how software architects design systems and frameworks to address the set of conflicting forces which come into play. I found the book to be an interesting case study"
4,Good Points of View,"Good points of view, but not all-encompassing analysis. Not militantly feminist, but focuses on a woman's perspective. A nice companion to the commentary one normally finds."
3,This commentary misses quite a few areas of interest,"I found this commentary quite incomplete when using it at Torah study. Will have to buy a more comprehensive Women's Torah Commentary, as this one misses many areas of interest in the portions it should cover. I was, in general, disappointed with it."
1,a pitiful enterprise,"My review will be short and to the point. If these radical feminist women ""rabbis"" are so pretentious and arrogant as to claim that the Holy Torah was the work of some male chauvinist pigs - God forbid - then, I must ask, why bother re-writing it and re-interpreting it at all? Just call it what it is, and let it go! What a pitiful waste of time it was to spend all that time explaining a text that was written by some lowlife male Rabbis who obviously hated women with a passion!The truth is, of course, that those Rabbis were smartly spending all their time explaining a truly Divine document - and all those fanciful ""interpretations"" penned by the 50 or so women ""rabbis"" were indeed a truly pitiful enterprise and a waste of time and ink.H.K."
5,"Inspired magic that is music,life & love itself","Please come inside to the world of Jason Micheal. I'm coming to you through the eyes and ears of the drummer that had the honor of participating on this CD. My name is Lou Dean Canakes II. Currently, I live in Dallas, Texas. I would really enjoy talking with you about your reviews and share any information I can about future show date(s) in Texas or California. You may e-mail me at louc@gwmail.plano.gov or simply call me at (972) 422-6819. Believe me, you will not regret purchasing this CD. Check it Out!"
4,In The Army Now,"Not only have I seen this movie, I was at Ft. Sill, Ok. when they made it. The film crew got me on tape but edited id out. In the scene were they're calling cadence,it was about 7:00am. They were doing this in family housing & woke me up, so ,not realizing who it was, I yelled at them to shut up. I would recommend this movie to anyone who needs a good laugh.Everytime I watch it brings back memories of Ft. Sill."
3,It makes the effort,"This movie never quite makes it to the level of being classically funny, but it does try. Made in the 1990s following Desert Storm, the movie follows a couple of losers who join the Army Reserve for a cash bonus, never dreaming that they might be sent to Chad to fight the Libyans.The movie has ""Desert Storm"" written all over it, from the uniforms to the jokes but the producers clarly made an effort to put together a movie that at least TRIED to get it right. Some genuinely laugh-out-loud moments make it worth watching but not worth watchng over and over again."
3,In The Army Now,Haven't seen this for quite a while. It's a bit of brain-in-neutral fun. No oscars here but a fair few laughs.
4,Typical Pauly Shore,"Just like all of his other movies, this one really doesn't go anywhere-but that doesn't mean it wont offer you a good time. There are many great one-liners and the acting is much better than you would expect. I have seen this movie many times and I simply never get tired of it. Don't hesitate to purchase, it's 100% worth it!"
4,fun and breezy,"I had a lot of fun with this no-thinking type comedy. It's perfect for a stress-free afternoon where you can drink a beer or snack on chips and just kill some time. It's funny, it's amusing, the antics are silly, and the story is actually engaging. Pauly Shore and Andy Dick need money after losing their jobs, find their way to the Army reserve recruitment center (quick money, easy hours, right? right???), and all is fun and games until they are called up because of a small type war in Libya... And guess what? Yep, Pauly and Andy save the day. It's formula, it's predictable at times, but it's just too fun to resist. I enjoyed my afternoon with this movie. I'm getting the DVD. It's fun enough to watch again when I feel like killing an easy afternoon. :)"
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME IN THE ARMY,IN THE ARMY NOW IS PAULY SHORE'S WORST DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME IT'S MARGINALLY BETTER THAN JURY DUTY OR THE SUPER DREADFUL BIO-DOME
3,Good Movie for one reason,"I enjoyed this movie because one thing. The Basic Training scene. It was filmed in the fort that i became a man, the home of the field artillery, Fort Sill, OK"
2,Short Routine,"I was very disappointed in the dance routine. There is a warm up and cool down and in between a short routine. Very short. I thought I missed something and kept rewinding and forwarding the DVD. If you have any rhythm at all, you will find this workout/dance boring. If you are looking for a fun way to workout which lasts more than a few minutes, I would suggest the Brazilian Dance Workout."
3,It's ok,"The work out is pretty good but after doing it a couple times it pretty easy, so the best way to challenged yourself would be to speed up. The film quality wasn't great the audio was wacko and off which I didn't like. Not that I bought the DVD for the audio but i've been turning the volume off when I've been playing it. So workout is fun, simple to do just bad filming."
3,Too easy,"This dance routine isn't bad, its even fun for the first few times, but I found it too easy. It's nice that you learn everything at the first time, but its not challenging and motivating enough. I have no latin-dance experience and still found the steps too easy and there is only like 5 or 6 of them. If you have some dance experience even with other dance styles I recommend something more advanced."
4,Samba Light,"This is a good exercise dvd but if you want to do ""hardcore"" samba, look into something else."
4,Great workout,"I LOVE this DVD. I purchased this DVD to add more variety in my workout routie. I am not a good dancer, but this DVD was very easy to follow. Steps presented here were simple, and the instructor goes over and over. I am hooked, because I feel like I am dancing at a club or something rather than working out at a gym-- yet I sweat and got a great workout.The only complain I have is that the DVD is rather short (something like 30 minutes, including both the warm-up and the cool-down.) Plus as I wrote above, she goes over and over the same steps, so you don't get to learn many different steps. (You only learn six movements.) But I complain ONLY BECAUSE I totally got hooked, and I want more."
4,Lots of fun,I haven't danced since my jazz dance class in 3rd grade. This DVD made me want to get out there again. The music is fun and the steps are easy enough for a novice. I was sweatin' in no time flat.
3,Fun but not enough chreography,"I really like Vanessa's stage presence and her dance was fun, but I don't think it had enough chreography to give me a good workout. This is great for people at the very beginning level since these moves are very basic and unintimidating. I'm going to try her other DVD and see if any of 'em challenge me and make me sweat."
3,not exactly what I aspected from,"I made the mistake, I thought was a workout to dance samba, steps etc.Actually is a workout made with some samba-similar steps oriented to aerobic gym.Anyway if you are looking for it that's your right choice."
4,Good dvd but smells horrid,"This may seem silly to some people, but this dvd smells terrible. Mine has a horrible odor like burnt tar - really strong. I like the dvd itself, but the smell really makes me nauseated. No, I do not have some weird smell obsession. I have almost 100 dvds and have never encountered this before. Otherwise, the dvd is fun. I have Vanessa Isaac's first dvd and will probably get the second samba dvd. Hope it smells better."
2,Could Have been great.,"I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased this program. I was interested in holiday cards, but I was looking for Easter, Valentines Day & Halloween. I assumed holidays would include all. Not the case, very few cards for these holidays and not any sentiments for them. The selection for Christmas cards looks to be very good if that is what you are looking for. I am disappointed and will find very little use for this program. I had a little trouble downloading the program and uninstalling was a nightmare. Had to do manually. I tried to determine by the box what holidays were included but the advertisment said pick your holiday, better info on the box would be great."
2,Instalation Problems,"I was very excited about this product after using the predecessor. But when I went to install it I had continual problems. Finally it damaged my kerner driver, needed to install programs. I can not get it reinstored or replaced and I have tried everytyhing they have suggested. I notified customer service and received two blanket fixes - neither of which worked and now I have never heard from them again. I'm very dissapointed in the fact this program damaged my compputer, and that customer service is only cursury at best. I have windows Milinniem edition with more that ample resources. I can not recommend purchase of this program at this time.Jim B"
4,The Dancefloor Starts Here,"Simply: Tracks 1,3,5,11,12 rock. The others are generally filler, but still better than FBS' contemporaries excluding Chemical Brothers. I would choose ""Exit Planet Dust"" by Chem Bros over this if I had to. This album's atleast as good as ""Youve Come A Long Way, Baby"" though."
2,Not great - get his newer stuff,"Fatboy Slim has put out some great electronica, but this CD is several years old, and it constantly reminds you with its flat sound and lack of development in the songs. As with a lot of earlier techno, the tracks often consist of a simple hook repeated over and over and over... it gets boring. The exceptions are the first and last tracks, which are quite beautiful. Unless you are a big Fatboy Slim fan and don't mind paying 15 bucks for two good songs, I suggest you leave this one alone and get one of his newer CDs."
3,a good dance album,"This is Fatboy Slim's first american debut, before he made it big. It's a good solid techo/dance album and can make anybody move around at your next party. It's full of samples and funky beats."
4,There is something about it.,"Something about this album began me to enjoy techno. It it seems to have these great meld of techno and more mainstream influences that make it appeal to a lower denominator (which ussually isn't good, but is here). The track Give The Po' Man a Break is a great fun track. Definetley an album you won't be disappointed with."
3,It's okay,"I'll probably get crucified for saying this, but I found some of the tracks a little repetative. Some of the tracks are good, but I've found myself putting other CDs in my player instead. I listened to it in a store first and thought I would like it, but I found it didn't have much staying power after I bought it. If you can, borrow it from a friend first and see how well you like after playing it the third or fourth time."
3,OK for cost,"Came quickly, value is appropriate for cost. Works okay for intended purpose - magnification of skin lesions, etc. while working as physician. Will upgrade to real glass when this wears out."
1,Save Your Money,"I chose this lighted magnifying glass for my elderly mother who has failing eyesight, buy who still loves to read; however, the light does not work though I used brand-new Duracell batteries. Looking inside the battery compartment, the switch-activated thin metal rod does not connect properly from the batteries to the base of the lightbulb, which sits at an angle to the batteries. I would not recommend buying this disappointing product, though the description seemed to fit the bill perfectly."
2,Not bright enough,"As a simple magnifier this works, but the light of the single LED was uselessly dim in anything but a dark room. The battery cover was difficult to remove and replace. Since I prefer a magnifier that can supply a decent amount of light, I ended up returning this item."
2,Better ones out there,"This magnifying glass is cheap and plasticky. It does work but there're better ones out there for the same price. I saw one the same size with better construction, 6 led's instead of 1, and cheaper too at my local Ace store."
3,Does (most of) the job...,"Looks nice, easy to hold. The light in the model I received doesn't work when the battery cover is completely attached. Light works fine when battery cover is off. Magnification/quality of lens is okay; the extra-magnification region is useful. It's decent enough for the price."
1,Poorly engineered and shoddily manufactured product,"I bought the 4"" Lighted Magnifier (Black) and it was a defective, substandard 'made in China' product. On closer scrutiny I found that the product is poorly engineered and shoddily manufactured. The handle of the magnifier in which the light swith is housed is too thin in diameter to properly accommodate it, and the switch worked loose and didn't function. I had to return the product."
5,Lightweight and Easy to Use,I am always looking for new magnifiers and ligths that will do the trick. This one is great because it is not to heavy and has the added advantage of the light which you can use or not. It has 2x magnification which is great for reading the paper or working on my suduku puzzles.
3,good,its 2x mag power is not much but its large diameter makes it unique( you can use it using both eyes like glasses instead of using it just with one eyebut the light swich is not high quality
4,10 years of rockin good sounds.,"This album takes the listener through ten years of Europe's music from the earlier heavier days of Stormwind through the fantastically sucessfull years of ""The Final Countdown"" right through to the latter years of Yesterdays News. Europe are surprisingly heavy in their earlier songs and this does reflect in their live shows. This album is a great blend of rockin songs and great ballads. For all rock fans there will be a song on here that will suit your tastes. A great all round rock album that sums up a fabulous 10 years for these talented Swedish guys."
2,For Ten Years I am Unimpressed,"If you wanted a greatest hits of Europe go buy the Final Countdown. There you would have it all! With ten years there are only about two other recognizable songs, and I wasn't impressed with them then either. Europe was one of the great 80's hair bands, but you need some big hits over the years and off of more than one album. Motley Crue, KISS, Whitesnake, Def Leppard had many albums with chart topping hits. Every hit by Europe came off of Fianl Countdown. There was Final Countdown, Cherokee, Rock The Night, and Carrie. I guess Europe thinks its the way to go as everyone it seems to be releasing a greatest hits compilation. But you need BIG HITS to put on it! Now go buy the Final Countdown and get out more hairspray!"
4,"Ah, The 80's!","Europe was a hair band from Sweden who enjoyed their gratest commercial success with 1986's The Final Countdown. Some of it may be a little AOR influenced, but it still is very good. The first few tracks are VERY heavy and power metal sounding. Then some lighter, but still powerful songs come. Included on here is some of the band's biggest hits, The Final Countdown, Rock The Night, and the sometimes corny power ballad Carrie. But in spite of the lyrics sometimes being corny, they were one of the most unusual, fun, and interesting bands of the infamous hair metal era."
4,80s > j00!,"I do not own any other Europe album but I must say that this compilation of songs is excellent and very enjoyable. Europe were definately one of the better Pop-Metal bands that ever was and its a shame they didnt gather more acclaim than other less talented bands of the era. Most of the Hard-Rockers here are catchy, the ballads are great, the solos... rock. I would reccoment this to anyone who liked similar-minded bands, as this seems to be the best Europe Compilation there is [excluding the new 1982-2000, which seems to include another version or Final Countdown]. The Best songs are... nearly all of them, but ESPECIALLY Final Countdown, Rock the Night, and Cherokee."
3,I was expecting more,"I found the first part of the book very enlightening as i was making a lot of the mistakes women made that makes men leave. Pretty informative. On the other hand i was expecting more on the part about ""women men love"". I am still not sure what to do to make them love me. I know what not to do so they wont leave, but not what to do to make them love me."
4,Good Book,"A few years after I read this book, I must say, this book helped A LOT. The writer is probably one of the brightest in the block. I didn't know a few finer details about relationships until I read this book... Marvellous!!A must read for all people that has been, will be, and looking into relationships!!"
2,Old and small print,"This book was published in 1988. The print in the book is very small and makes for hard reading. The content of the book is right on and makes sence, however I read ""Why Men Marry Bitches"" before reading this and it blew this one out of the water!"
5,Goes to the root of relationships,A wonderful book about men/women relationships and why or why not they work. A good emphasis on building individual lovable characteristics. Reccomended.
4,An eye openner!,"If you want to know why your relationships don't work-out this is the book to read. This is one of those books that has helped me open up my eyes to the mistakes that I have made in my relationships. The authors help you realize why you make those mistakes and why things that you do get the certain reaction. This book helped me tremendously, by realizing where I have gone wrong in my relationships and has helped me take a step back and rethink my actions. I would almost skip the tests at the end of the book though its too depressing :).Women Men Love, Women Men Leave: What Makes Men Want to Commit?"
2,not what i thought it would be.,"I wanted something easier to understand and something i wanted to read front to back, but this is hard to comprehend even for someone who took psychology in college. found myself flipping past chapter after chapter not even reading the entire thing. didnt get alot of insight from this book."
1,Book is old and outdated,"I am not pleased with my purchase of this book. It's 17 years old and a lot of things have changed on the dating scene since then. I did not find anything interesting about this book and feel that it should be taken out of circulation, since it's so old and a bit useless."
2,Disappointed,"I'm disappointed with this book. The way it's written is very boring, I could not get over it. Waste of money and time. I highly recommend ""Why men marry bitches"" by Sherry Argov. Her relationship principles are right on!"
4,Eye Opener,"Okay, this book is definitely an eye opener. I've read the Steve Harvey books which broke down alot of myths that women had and this book was a continuation of an insight into the minds of men."
4,Why worry,"This recording is a little too melodramatic, but then, I am a male and I am not used to this kind of thing. I can safely say that this audio is for women, there is no advice here for us guys."
3,BIG!,"Ordered a large pair to replace my worn out sweats. Wow, these are long! In times where manufactures are looking to cut costs, I don't understand why these have about 20% extra fabric. Even the crotch sits way lower than my old pair. Next time I will order one size smaller even though I never buy medium."
2,russell athletic cottom poly blend sweatpants,"i don't care for this product. I already own a pair of Russell Athletic Sweatpants which fit this same description. The big difference is the blend of cotton/poly. In the first pair I purchased the blend was 65%cotton/35%poly, they were also labeled Premier. this second pair, which i purchased off of amazon, are 50/50cotton/poly, and they aren't nearly as durable and comfortable as the premier pair. i am trying to resell the 50/50 blend pair rt now on ebay."
2,Too Thin,"Reading the description, I thought they would be more substantial (more than likely good for light workouts).DOES NOT RUSSELL MAKE THICK, LONG-LASTING SWEATS ANYMORE??"
3,not up to standard,They are very light weight and not what I expected from Russell. I put them in a drawer and I will use them next summer. You get what you pay for but they should say that they are light weight and not for outside winter wear.
2,Shrinks after first wash and dry!,"They are fine and just what I was looking for, but after the first wash and dryer exposure they shrunk a bit particularly in length. So, if you are a large probably should consider the X-large considering the shrinkage."
4,Extremely Comfortable Athletic Pants,"I bought these for the open bottoms, I also bought to do my walking, but they are too lightweight to use below 50 degrees unless you wear a pair of thermals under. I really like because you can do your excercise outside and continue to wear for the day. They don't get hotter like other fleece pants. I will buy this product again when necesary."
2,It's like wearing pantyhose,"These pants are THIN. No warmth whatsoever. Great on a hot summer day, but not in moderate temperatures. You'll freeze! Not worth the 13.99 for such thin material."
1,Poor quality,"Had I had know that these pants would be so big (I ordered a large), I would have ordered a size smaller. Besides this, they are very thin and cheap! No wonder they could not get retail price for them which is ridiculously expensive. I am sending these back immediately."
4,On the thin side,"These pants are alright. They are thinner than I was looking for, but they fit well. The pants have a nice elastic waist."
3,Russell Pant,"Well-made, beautiful pants, but my husband swam in these. I bought an X-large, and he is clearly an X-large size. But these were too big in the waist, way too long, and I returned them. The large might have been OK, but by then he neeeded them quicker than mail, so I purchased them from a big box store."
2,Lightweight sweatpants with flimsy construction,"I just received these sweatpants 2 days ago and have worn them twice. I was looking for some light-weight, comfortable sweatpants with pockets, which is what I received. The fabric is soft and the picture provides an accurate representation of the item. The pants seem sized larger than expected (in both measurements), although it's possible they would shrink to the given size in the wash.Sadly, I forgot to include the basics, like quality of build, in my criteria. The first time I wore these sweatpants, the drawstring disconnected from the back of the waistline. After that, I was able to completely remove the drawstring from the waistband. I wish I could say that I unduly stressed the cord, but I was basically just re-positioning the waist.I will not be going with the same item again."
2,shipment wrong,"Wrong color, order black and got all grey, wrong color ordered black got grey, wrong color, will be returning asap"
2,Pants,There not really want I was wanting and the strings break why to easy and they get wholes way to easy also
3,Thin material,"Thin material, more in line with sleepwear. Extra long legs for xl size. My older Russell sweats fit better and were a true sweat pant."
3,Thin,"Pros: PriceCons: Very ThinOther comments: Wasn't freeIf I knew they were thin, I wouldn't have purchased. Good for hot weather, they're almost like pajamas/sleep wear."
5,"Great sweatpants, different than other colors though.","So I bought these sweatpants being a college student and all, sweatpants should basically be considered my skin. I got two pairs, black and a dark grey. The black pants are more of a cotton pant with no fleece while the darker grey are actually sweatpants. On top of that the sizing is a bit different with each one. XXL for the dark grey was more of a XL and the black was a true XXL. I might be returning the black pair unless if the washing machine works some magic, if not I'll see if a friend or family member wants them. As for the construction of the pants they both seem rather sturdy.I'll be buying more pants but I'll have to double check on the TYPE I get before I decide on the size."
4,"Well made, but very long","My husband is 5'7"" and these were about 4 inches too long. Otherwise they seem to be made very well, but had to return."
3,Not as expected,"These pants were a gift for my husband. The material is not as expected. It is a very thin cotton, not your typical moisture wicking pant material. I am skeptical as to how these will wash and wear. They will be perfectly fine to lounge around the house, but I am not sure for running..."
3,Super Comfy,"Super comfy, great pants for lazing around the house. You will definitely be happy with them. Only complaint is that they run pretty big (at least from what I was expecting).I am 6'2"", 205, 38 waist and the XL was a bit big for me. Had to shrink them in the wash to get the right fit. Otherwise great, just buy down a size."
4,russell athletic pants,"I like the pants. I have had them before,however, this time the pants are too long. About 2 inches. So i'll need to have them altered. Next time i'll eter have to find out from you what lengths are available or buy them somewhere else."
3,Run large,"These pants run very large...soft and comfortable, suggest you order one size down. Disappointing as they are cotton and good for lounging."
2,comfortable but sized for short legged people,"Bought a whole bunch of these in black, grey, and blue. Loved the open leg, light material. HOWEVER, they are imports, and they must be produced in a country of midgets. They are over-generously proportioned in the legs and seat, but a medium pant ought to have a leg inseam in the 32"" in range. These are about 28"" after the first washing -52%poly/42%cotton. Steve Urkle would be proud to wear them, but I'll be turning them into shorts - heck they're already knickers. Additionally, Russell has no customer service to speak of. Their web site listed outdated phone numbers. An email to their sales rep, and a phone call to an answering machine at the corporate office for the Southern Division (since the northeast's numbers were non-functional) resulted in no response. I always had good luck with their product, but I wouldn't buy from them again after this."
5,A great college text on North American Christian history,"I think that this is a very thorough, enjoyable journey through the history of Christianity in the US and Canada. He not only focuses on events such as the two American Great Awakenings, but he pauses to discuss some of the more interesting and influential Christians of the times (Anne Hutchinson, Charles Finney, George Whitefield, Francis Asbury, Fulton Sheen, Billy Graham, et al). I highly recommend this book, but it is a long book, so be prepared for many hours of reading."
5,still enjoying the book,"ok, I'm a slow reader. I also tend to read 3 books at a time. I checked this out at my local library and wanted a copy of it. It seems to be very well written and i am very interested in the early history of the United states (cause college sure didn't teach this stuff!)."
2,No page numbers to reference as source for classes,No page numbers to reference as source for classes. Book is useless to a student who needs to reference this book as a source.
4,Beats the original,"If you spent your childhood always having to pick up your Monopoly board before you and your friends could finish a game, then this is for you. You can customize your game in about 20 different ways, including short game rules, the ""free parking rule,"" and imposing penalties for mortgaging property.The most innovative feature is a game calculator that instantly calculates things like your net worth (great if you land on that ""10% or $200"" square) or the future value of a property to your or other players. You can make trades with your computer opponents, and you can choose from game boards featuring photos of about 10 different cities (or customize a board to your own city using the easy game board editor).Two piques: 1) Although you can turn off the token voices, ""game host"" voice, and noisome music, you don't have the option of turning off the basic sound effects. 2) The game board jumps around to different angles with every move. Other than that, very fun game!"
3,Bloody Hell!,"I love Monopoly but it's a pain in the royal chambers to set up all the money and clean it up after you're done. I thought this game would get rid of those problems, which it did, but it also made new ones. The host sound like a yankee carnie from the early 90's, dare I say. The computer always maanages to land on his own properties all the time and is quite stubborn in the trade aspect. This game frequently freezes, which is another annoyance. Finally, the map editor. It seems like a brilliant idea, but you can't save your bloody work! Overall, if you enjoy playing cartoon-like games, this is for you."
1,What OS are you using?,On anything OS 9+ on two different machines a CD game that worked a few years ago is now totally unsupported and useless. I hope this current CD works for you.
4,Not bad.....good old fashioned game,"This game is similar to the one I have for PC. A few of the features did not show up.For example, mortgage bracket on the ""State Ave"" is missing and the truck to take a game piece to ""jail"" did not show up. Otherwise it is a great game to play."
1,Bunk As Hell,"I got this thinking that he wit lynch and that he's sick and tight. I was wrong. This album is bunk. Sorry. To me tight rappers are: all the sac 94' ablums dropped by, lynch, mr. doc, raided, sicx, 2pac, we come strapped by eiht, the cin sity click, some 415 rappers, 213 rappers and much more. But this album is straight nothing like anything I ever heard. Its bunk and wack. Alot of people like this album though but i dont know any of them. I think that you either really like it or really hate it. I'm one who thinks its sorry and a waste of my money. He has his own style and some like it some dont."
3,A letdown,Not as good as I expected. I did more research on my own and came up with better lists. okay
3,"Again an ""almost"" book","Rob Neyer can write, as witnessed by his ESPN.com columns, and the best part of the book are his little anecdotes and essays. So why is the major part of the book all these boring lineup lists? Do we really need a first and second team for some teams? Does every danged team need an All-Rookie or All-Bust team? My eyes began to glaze over.This book needed serious editing of the slash and burn type. Not that it's a bad read but it's so repetitious, it sucks all the enjoyment out of it. I mean, who cares beyond Rockies' fans about their all-time lineup let alone their All-Traded Away team or whatever team. They've only been around, what, less than 10 seasons. It's overkill.Considering all the research he probably spent to come up with these definitive lists, the book can be read in less than a day. That is NOT good value!"
2,OK but....,"Reading this book one see's the tremendous shadow cast by Bill James. Neyer is clearly a disciple and, if you have read James, Neyer's attempt to imitate the wonderfull funny prose is almost embarrasing. He comes a little closer in his attempt to think like James but only a little. For those who love baseball, great writing and truly original insight I suggest starting with James. Otherwise this is a pretty fun concept book."
1,Jet's biggest disappointment,"I'm a big jet owner but am VERY disappointed in this sander. The table height adjustment is primitive. It takes holding it in place with two hands and tightening two knobs. Very, very poor design. And the table obscures over an inch of the belt, so this sander only has about 4 1/2 inches usable. Very poor.Table angle adjustment is very crude. A single toggle lever in a hard to access place. I don't tilt it much so it's not a big deal, but it is a poor design.I haven't tried/needed to adjust tracking yet but the adjustment looks like it is going to be a hassle, unlike my Delta drum/disk sander.This whole tool feels like one of Jet's first designs that never got improved. This is NOT the quality I expect from Jet. I'm sorry I bought it."
4,Movie within a movie.,Informative from the Armenian point of view. Creates links with the present day. The portrayal of the Turkish-American customs inspector is the best human interest element in the film.
4,Definitely An Egoyan Film,"At least now audiences can have access to this remarkable film that fails almost as often as it succeeds, but is definitely worth the watch. The fact that this film did not gain a wider release in a country that prides itself on freedom of speech says something of the power of special interest groups OUTSIDE the USA to stifle creativity and free speech within it. I've seen much worse films gain a much wider release. Again not Egoyan's best but definitely not a dud. In places it's even sheer genius."
1,One word: Boring,"I think I found the cure for insomnia its name is Ararat. No joke I actually fell asleep around three times trying to watch this damn movie. If it weren't for my teacher making us watch it i wouldn't have bothered watching it at all. it is by far one of the dullest movies I have ever seen. I'm sure it was well intentioned but man what a snoozefest. If you guys have trouble falling asleep at night pop this in your player, you'll knock out instantly."
4,Well made film full of lies,"It is interesting how the movie was presented... things completely irrelevant were tied together. The film was purely made to play on American and Canadian public. It touched sensitive issues, presented plenty of opportunities for Armenians to tell their ""story"" and solidify it thru non-existent ""facts and documents"", and personified Turks as the cruel ones. The film's goal was not to bring ligth to dark sides of Armenian history, but rather to provide a support for the fake story of the genocide for years to come.In the movie, these ""mythical"" Americans were used to manipulate the feelings and gain support of the average American. French language is constantly used throughout the movie to sympathize with French and Canadians. Very manupulative plot!!!I would recommend watching the movie keeping in mind that it is full of falsifications and lies.God Bless America."
5,Pretty sad,".... This movie is about Raffi,whos dead dad is labeled as a ""terrorist"" . Raffi is sleeping with his step sister(whos a hoe)she blames raffis mom cuz her dad died but shes just lyin cuz shes freakin pshyco. Raffi is basically taing her side over his own mothers. When his mother is asked to be a historical consultant for a movie about the genocide, raffi works on set and slowly learns about the torture the armenians went through.Eventually Raffi matures when he comes back from a trip to armenia and if u want to know the rest go watch the movie. This movie is the sad truth, children being nailed to crosses,young women forced to dance naked and then burned to death,12 year old girls raped in front of their younger siblings,pregnent women having their unborn babies torn out of their stomach and then raped,and so on.Ya its sad..just watch it."
1,a lousy boring weakly scripted movie with big Zzzzzz,"don't know what the purpose of making this movie except that certain racial interest is trying to follow the hollocaut step. the script is so loosely written almost without a focus, so weak that has to use some totally unrelated young people sexual scenes to trick some people watching this pathetically directed, scripted and acted movie. i've wasted about one hour trying very hard to get something out of this highly praised but really hyped movie and then, decided to drop it. life is too short, man, don't have time to wake up the dead and mourn for them again and again, move on, man, just move on. i don't like to waste my hard working earned money to watch some politically or ideologically oriented movie, only focused on ""the history owes us an explanation, certain people owes us big..."" k se la se la, what happened, happened, let go and move on."
1,"A warped movie, evoking racism and hatred.","This so called genocide was just as bad as when the north killed hundreds of thousands of southerners, during the civil war. Those blood hungry ravages, oh wait, the north was fighting the south for political reasons. This film basically depicts Turks as Nazis without much factualy support. For a man (the director), who just recently admits he is armenian, this film just makes no sense."
4,ARARAT,"No doubt sad but true, the story the production acting was little poor but who am I to judge.My comment is that: I saw the film in Paris while I was onvacation, all my relatives were waiting unpatiently for the release where I never heard about it in the US consedering there is a great number of Armenians and being borders with Canada.My wish is after putting all that effort to make such a greatpiece of work, advertise it, market it, let it be heard.Hope to see it soon in theaters in US especialy in California.Even in limitted areas, I am not criticising but wishingsuccessful start, so there will more masterpieces to follow.after all everything cost money, but not to forget if you wanna be heard must be on the big screen and media.Thanks! Keep up the good work"
4,excellent!!,It has been long overdue for a motion picture film about the first genocide of the century. Finally the world can learn about the atrocities that took place during WWI. I don't know an Armenian who hasn't lost a relative or family member during those dark times. Egoyan's genius comes through in this film.
5,Heartwrenching and Powerful,A very heartwrenching and powerful film detailing just a small sliver of the history of the Armenian Genocide. This movie expertly raises the question of truth and denial and how one seeks/finds it.Highly recommended for those who see beyond the superficial and who would like to walk away from seeing a movie THINKING and FEELING.
5,Wonderful production of the old Japanese childrens fable,"I had seen this several years ago when it was on tape and am very delighted to see that it is comming out on DVD.Giovanii and his friend suddenly find themselves on a train speeding through the galaxy, meeting people and seeing sites they only imagined. At certain cross roads they must decide what to do, where to go and what to see. After making a promise to always be together one of the two must decide whats best for their friendship.Granted this is slow moving, but very deep. For example Lain, being slow but interesting. Alot of symbolisim is painted in this film with its whole some plot and its views of certain things such as heaven and death.Personally I think this is for a select audience, for those who like Dragon Ball Z or Tenchi Muyo may not enjoy this, but for those who enjoy stylist and deep features such as Please Save my Earth and Utena may infact enjoy this."
5,"What's ""Polaris"" in Esperanto?","Oh so slowly did this film coax a tear from each my eyes. Don't believe twits who either couldn't finish it or (gasp) see it as a christian fable, they're obviously impatient christians! (as far as i know, the author was a confirmed buddhist...)""In Chinese mythology, the constellation Cygnus is the site of the once-a-year magpie bridge which connects the lovers Niu Lang and Zhi Nu (see Qi Xi)."" -from Wikipedia"
3,A film with all the beauty and pace of a painting,"The animation in Night on the Galactic Railroad is good, in some places quite beautiful, with images reminiscent of those Miyazaki will later use in Spirited Away to much better effect. This is a poignant film and the sentiment is clearly heartfelt. The main problem is the movie just crawls. At one point the character says he's in a hurry and then proceeds to shuffle across the screen for about 70 seconds, perhaps pondering Zeno's paradox. The heavy breathing and ubiquitous ""Uhhh"" in the dialogue would be a distraction except that often that's the only thing going on, so there's nothing to take your attention away from. I watched this film with my seven-year old daughter and after a while we were making jokes just to pass the time. There were several sequences both of us watched with interest. I also found the metaphorical meditation on death intriguing. But this movie could have done all it was intended to in about half the time."
2,Disappointing...,"I was delighted to receive this movie recently - so many good reviews, only a few pans... Alas, for once I find myself in the ""pan"" crowd. This film has nice visuals (not great - color is neither luminous, subtle nor particularly harmonious - action slow and stilted) - plot is predictable in places and largely directionless - pacing lugubrious. I watched for what seemed an eternity and had to turn it off - nothing to keep my interest. Never have been tempted to view it again, and won't consider trying it on the kids."
3,Beautiful Slow Christian Death-Cult Flick,"Neat animation (for those that don't mind a tepid pace), but the moral backdrop is reprehensible: bad little boys who don't properly attend to their parents go to hell and burn forever, even if they are basically good at heart."
1,I have no idea what it is about,"I RARELY don't finish a movie after I've started watching it but this movie bored me to tears. I sat through 30min of this movie and absolutely nothing happened. Blue kitty cat goes to school, blue kitty cat goes to get milk, blue kitty cat gets on a train, blue and pink kitty cat go exploring. I couldn't take it any more. The images are beautiful and I'm sure this movie had some sort of deep message but it's just way too boring. I took the DVD out and put in Akira."
4,800 Pages of Solid Introduction to JSP (and Java),"As an experienced web developer who wants to learn JSP and Java, this book maintains just the right pace for me. I'd been trying to teach myself Java using other books, but needed a focus and frame of reference to make the study interesting.This book provides that. The Java and JSP are woven together in a practical and digestible fashion.I'd give it five stars, but for the occasional typos in code samples (several in Chapter 7) which cause compile or runtime errors. For a beginner, it can be frustrating to identify the source of errors and make the necessary corrections without having prior experience with the language. Still, not bad for a first edition. ..."
2,The Editor should be ashamed,"Thanks to everyone who mentioned the numerous errors in this book in their reviews. I only wish I had read them before buying the book. Not only is it full of every type of error you can think of, it is also poorly organized with a heavy-duty chapter on tag libraries sandwiched between otherwise introductory material. Also, the last half of the book is meant to be a case study but the sections are pasted together with little or no indication as to what is part of the case study and what is an overall observation making it impossible to follow along. If you do buy the book (and I recommend you don't) print out the errata list from their website -- it'll save you hours of frustration. However, don't expect it to be complete."
4,Good books - lots of errors!,"I'm about halfway through the book and feel like I'm gaining a lot of knowledge. I think this book is teaching me all the things I need to know to successfully work with JSP.However, the book is filled with errors! I have resorted to keeping the ""Book Errata"" webpage up on my computer and checking it first if I have a problem with an example or understanding a point. It's a real pain to pour over a piece a code that isn't working assuming I've made a typo only to realize the book is wrong! I realize there will always be some mistakes, but the ones in this book are very frequent.Bottom line: I don't think the errors negatively impact the usefulness of the book, but they sure are annoying. Beware!"
5,Excellent book to learn JSP !,"Believe me. If you know only HTML and want to learn JSP, this is the only book you need!This book covers variety of topics like: Object-oriented programming in Java, Java's core utility and input/output classes, How to use and create JSP Tag Libraries, Best practices in designing web applications with Java, How to install Java and JSP/Servlets, How to create dynamic web sites with JavaServer Pages (JSP), Relational database access with MySQL and JDBC, Using the popular Struts framework to simplify application design"
4,Good Beginners text,"I found this book to be very useful. I have been developing we applications now for 4 years using ASP, and I still found this book useful. I have been trying to find a good book about developing we apps, especially in JSP. It has great examples for developing the JSP page and the presentation is also excellent.The one star missing due to lack of robust code in some sections.Nevertheless,a must have book for all."
2,Too many errors in this book,"This book is filled with errors. For instance, in one section, the author refers to a sample jsp but what is under it is an java file instead. Then the author instructs the reader to copy the sample code for a java file but this is the jsp instead. Plus in many places, the author instructs the reader to create a directory but then a couple of paragraphs later the author is instructing the reader to save some code in an entirely different directory than the one the reader just created.Where was the editor of this book?"
2,No source code for this book,The book says that the source code can be downloaded from wrox.com. But that is not true. The book does not have a CD nor does it have source code at wrox.com. Beaware of it.
2,A Classic Game,"The only people that could enjoy this game are the kids.But most of the questions are adult level. This can be a problem.If you see it somewhere at a garage sale for five bucks then maybe you should get it. It looks funner than it really is. You have to be bored as hell to even consider playing this game.I have no idea why I'm even writing a review for this game.But hey, there are worse."
4,The Trail of Seven days,I made the title to my review of the Trail to Seven Pines the Trail of seven days because thats how long it takes to get to the climax of the story. Other than having the longest rising action I have ever read I would say this is a very good book to read. You will really enjoy this book if you like westerns with alot of action. This book is full of action so that way you won't get bored while your reading it. So all in all if you want a good book to read The Trail to Seven Pines is definintly the way to go.
4,HOPALONG FINDS TROUBLE,"The young man who had to read a book for school, and his father gave him this L'Mour book, should be taught the time to write a review is not after the 3rd. chapter but only after you finish. After all the reason for a review is to recommend or not recommend, how can you be fair if only partialy done. Anyway I like the story except it seemed to me that Mr.L'Amour was trying to hard to use poetry in his descriptions and I don't think it worked for me, (just my opinion). The story itself was fine."
3,Caveat emptor,"I should say that I don't own this album, but based on the listing above-- if it's accurate-- it omits several of the best BTF sketches, such as So That's The Way You Like it (the satire of Olivier-style talkingShakespeareveryveryfast), Dudley Moore's parodies of Britten and Weill, and Peter Cook's Harold Macmillan imitation. These are all included on the other BTF CD available, which is more expensive but has three times more material.As to the previous criticism, the very point of BTF is its Britishness; if you don't ""get it"" I recommend Minnie Pearl or Prairie Home Companion ;) ..."
5,No other like it,Magic School Bus episodes are well received in this household. This is a fantastic addition to our collection of MSB DVDs.
2,Skirt wayyy to small,"I will re-affirm what a lot of other reviews said. I am an average sized girl 5'5 130 pounds and ordered a S/M based on my measurements (34-27-36, size 6) and the size chart. The skirt is not even close to being big enough to fit over my hips. I tried it on and the zipper broke as soon as I touched it. The top is alright, a little too big. If you still want to order this, size up. The top is way easier to adjust than the skirt. Hopefully I can somehow make it work with a broken zipper."
4,item was cute and in new condition but the top was 2X to big even though I oprderd a medium but the bottoms fit great,item was cute and in new condition but the top was 2X to big even though I oprderd a medium but the bottoms fit great
2,Not satisfied,"I ordered this outfit because I thought it was fairly inexpensive, but also cute (in picture). I ordered a size xs which is for sizes 0-2. I got the product and the skirt was a perfect fit, but quite long. The bows and tie were pretty cute, but the tie is sewn the wrong way, so it'll always look crooked. The top however, is just bad. It was waaay too big, which didn't make sense since the skirt was so small. The width of the top was just soo wide. I definitely can't wear the top. So I sewed the entire top myself, it's a little better, but I still can't wear it out. I'm just going to have to find my own schoolgirl top somewhere else."
3,Not necessarily made for women,"Maybe I just don't have the body type for this outfit but it's just not really working. I bought a medium and it should fit and does in some ways. The shirt is small tie-wise, it sort of fits the same but the ties end a lot closer to the knot for sure. The skirt is what I have the most issue with. It's loose on the waist except that the top band is elastic giving it this weird rounded shape between the pleats and the top. I can't get it past my hips without a lot of work though. Overall, better than some outfits but of course, not really like the picture..."
3,Accurate Reviews,"The product came very promptly. For the money spent, I am pleased.However, the zipper on the skirt doesn't go all the way down. It wasn't sewn in straight, and the fabric gets in the way of the zipper about halfway. Because I have hips, I have to put the skirt on over my head.The other reviews are very accurate--skirt is a little small: doesn't quite cover my butt, but I don't think the boyfriend will complain about that ;) . The top is a little large--I wear a 36 D bra, and the M/L top is far too big for me. But you can just tie it tighter. It takes some fiddling so that the top doesn't look ridiculous, but not too much of a problem.All in all, the product is acceptable for the money spent. I wasn't sure about the whole schoolgirl thing, so I went inexpensive. I was pleased that the neck tie was included; I didn't think it would be."
1,"Skirt very small, bad return policy","Skirt is extremely small. Top fits fine. This was a christmas gift and when I tried to return it they refused because it was out of the 7 day window. Who orders a christmas gift, gives it to someone and can get it returned within 7 days if it doesn't fit."
2,"Wouldn't recommend, unless you look like the girl in the picture","The top was 2x way too big on me, which, okay, I can manage around that, I am small up top, but the skirt was way too small. Shame, it is such a cute outfit, my husband would of loved it!"
2,Good Memory - Better Memory Out There,Memory is a commodity product. PNY is a good company and a 128mb upgrade will enhance your computer tremendously. Check out other memory mfgs. to compare. If you have the money buy the PNY. All memory boards are made with basically the same chips. PNY has a standard industry warranty.
3,Memory works well. Still no rebate after 11 weeks,I have purchased the 64MB version and it works well with my Abit motherboard. The problem is that PNY is extremely slow returning rebates! It has been 11 weeks and I still have not seen my rebate. They said it would take 8 weeks.
1,pny rebates,"I bought one 32MB simm, late August 99, and have yet to receivemy rebate. What a hassle! Do they or don't they?"
3,extremely general information for a new collector.,"A new collector anticipates a little more in pictures, and styles, than general history of the eras of styles. Although this book had many pictures, it didn't quite hit the mark on actually idintifying pots by marks. I believe a colored catalogue of pics with marks would encourage a new collector to research their histories."
2,Misleading advertisement!,"I was very disappointed. These do NOT come with any handle as the picture advertises and no disclaimer such as ""Handle not included"" or ""Broom head only""Who is to blame???This turned out NOT to be a good buy as I had purchased several for my company and now need to purchase handles for each.It just irks me to not get what is promoted...I don't do that to my customers, and I don't do business a second time with those that do it to me!Fool me once..."
2,Shipped wrong color,"I purchased the silver tealight set and was shipped the pink set. Contacted the seller and she offered discount on the pink one because the silver was sold out. Next time, I should be notified that the item I purchase will be the EXACT item I receive."
2,Great Performance Marred by Editing,"The performance seemed great, but I couldn't stand how choppy the editing was. In the first concert, the camera angle changes every 3 seconds or less. I am not exaggerating. This made it really difficult for me to enjoy."
3,Inexpensive peep-toe shoe,"These shoes are great if you're not looking to spend a lot of money on a peep-toe shoe. They don't have that high of a heel, and are best when broken in after a few wears. I had these shoes in the brownish burgundy color and they actually lasted quite a long time! Cute with jeans, a dress, or a skirt!"
4,Nice Shoe,I really like this shoe. The only draw back is that the leather is not as soft as I would like. I think they will be perfect once they have been broken in.
5,Awesome Product,"Anything from Altec-Lansing is awesome. I don't have this particular model, but I have a similar PowerCube System and it's watts may seem low but the bass pumps bigtime and the Mids that come with it definitely make this product worth buying! My older PowerCube system, not as good as this one, rocks on Cambridge Soundworks, that's the power!"
5,amazing sound,"I recently ordered a new computer for college and ordered these speakers with it. If you didn't see where the sound was coming from, you would swear it was from a real stereo. I was just blown away at how crisp the sound is, and how real the surround sound effects seem. Since I don't have a stereo at school, these speakers serve as my means of music listening, and frankly, I don't need a stereo with great computer speakers like these."
3,Keys fall out easily,"Nice key set but if you need to leave the keys in the locks, they easily fall out."
5,Kirk Franklin and the Family: Live,"Kirk Franklin and the Family : Live is an excellent gospel DVD , from start to finish they kept the spirit high and their energy flowing.I would recommand this DVD for others to purchase. I "" THANK"" Kirk for also captivating the attention of our younger generation and bringing them closer to god's words thru his musics. The sound and lights were very sharp in giving this DVD very high quality."
2,Kirk Franklin and The Family: Live.,Not as good as his other DVD's live with his church choir and band.His band and choir rock. I would love to be in a gospel group like his.If you are a drummer - you would be in heaven.
1,OLD......OLD..........OLD!!!!!!,Did not realize how OLD it was until I received it. Next time I'll look closely before I buy it.
3,"Very effective, but very fragile","My wife loves the ability of these glasses to insulate a drink, but they are made of a very thin glass. Even a gentle bump will cause it to shatter into a million shards of thin, difficult-to-see glass."
4,Bodum Assam Double-Wall Beer Glasses Review,"My husband is a beer drinker and this is by far his preferred glass. Our only problem is that they're a bit fragile, but they're well-worth the special handling. We do put them in the dishwasher."
1,Too fragile,"I read the review about how easily these glasses crack, but I bought anyway. Sure enough, after first use, one is cracked."
1,Too fragile,"These glasses are a great idea, a nice shape, and perfect for beer. They would get a five except they are both broken in two weeks time. They are ultra thin glass. One broke the first time it was used. Set it down on the granite counter a little too hard and it cracked. The second one broke when I dropped a really small ice cube into it. Just pop! Another one bites the dust."
4,bodum glasses,"Other than the fact that it is necessary to take care that you're gentle with these glasses, they are an excellent buy. I've yet to try them with a hot drink, but my beer stays icy cold much longer than in the bottle."
4,"Nice, but capacity is not 13 oz","Nice glass. Sometimes these double-walled glasses are too thick and you end up getting up a little dribble on your chin after each sip, but these are thin enough at the rim of the glass to keep that from happening. Good, precise-feeling glass and it keeps the beer cold long enough for a casual drink. My only complaint is that it does not hold 13 oz. It may DISPLACE 13oz, but it holds about 12 ounces. No problem with a light-headed beer, but if your beer tends to head-up, you'll have to finish the bottle with a second pour."
1,Bodum,"In theory and style, these are great glasses. The problem is that they shatter very easily. I've had several sets break during shipment and very soon after the first use. They can be a hazard when they shatter in your hands! Amazon told me to toss the shattered glasses and they would send me a replacement. I've had to do this a few times and now Amazon has decided to charge me for the broken glasses because I didn't return them... Obviously I've given up on this brand. I just wish Amazon would wake up and realize its a poor quality product."
3,Very fragile,"We were given a set of 4 glasses as house warming presents. They were a wonderful novelty and the go to glasses for a beer. They did keep the beverages the temperature you wanted for longer than usual. Only problem was that they were fragile. One broke in my hand while the others broke in the sink or being put away in the cabinet. They were free and we had no complaints about the performance. They did what we wanted, too bad we didn't have a protective bubble for them."
3,"art, not utility","I have owned all of the Bodum, insulated glassware for home and commercial use. The good part, they are some of the most beautiful glass drinkware I have ever seen. The bad news is that they break VERY easily, and when they do, they have the tendency to explode (no joke). If you want fragile, art to drink from, then Bodum is for you. If you want functional glassware, I recommend looking elsewhere."
1,broken glass,"I purchased Bodum beer glass, and used them for the first time yesterday. and I noticed the inside of the glass was broken that I didn't paid attention when I put them in a cabinet. I'm sure it was a defective product from the first place. I'm very disappointed. I tried to contact the company 'River Road' but they just replied that to contact Amazon."
4,Great For Small Hands,"The primary reason I like these is because I don't have to use coasters! They truly are insulated, and after several uses, they haven't had a drop of condensation on the outside. Also, I do like the fact that they're so thin and lightweight that they feel kind of like air in my hands.The primary reasons I won't buy any more are one,because of the price, and two, because I have to be too careful with them. The are fine in the dishwasher, but when I'm using one, I'm always afraid I'm going to drop it and lose what I consider to be a considerable financial investment.When all four of my Bodums break, that's the end for me, unless they've gone way down in price by that time."
3,How about using some more bubblewrap?,"These glasses are wonderful. We have owned a set for 2 years and use them strictly for beer, no ice! I wished to purchase a set for my father for Christmas and was aware of all the reviews on Amazon. My package arrived today from Amazon, with no bubble wrap and all 4 of the glasses were completely smashed. I really had wished that someone would have taken the time to properly package my glasses! I am sad. I will now have to hunt for these glasses locally!"
4,Great beer glass,These are great glasses. Attractive and they keep the beer at the right temperature. They are very easy to break though so care should be taken when using them. I would always replace them if they were unusuable.
4,"Works as advertised, fragile",I love these beer glasses and plan to buy more. I just wish they weren't so fragile. They break easily. -1 star for fragility
2,"looked and worked great, while they lasted","Well, that didn't take long...Less than a week after receiving our box of two glasses, one is already broken simply by accidently touching the top rim against another glass.Please beware, these are very fragile glasses on the order of very thin and fragile crystal. You may even break them by touching the rim with a bottle while pouring, etc.Great idea, worked great too. Just not worth it. I'm going to see if I can get a partial refund.Get yourself some Tervis Tumblers, same idea but in sturdy polycarbonate plastic."
3,"Great Glasses, but only if the user is great, too...","These double-walled glasses kicked some major butt.While they lasted.I love beer, and these were perfect for keeping a tall-n'-frosty, FROSTY. They were great.BUT, within a month, both had fallen prey to a house with dangerous, hard surfaces; their thin walls were little splinters of light on the floor and sink, respectively.So, if you are sure you can care for them gently and nicely, I'd say get them. If you have a sink with a little bit of a slope that causes them to tip, or you leave them near the edge of a drying rack, you'll be living in constant fear of breaking them.If I could shelter them, I'd have a set of twelve."
2,"impressive looks, too fragile for everyday","i bought these mugs because i thought they were aesthetically pleasing as well as really a good idea. these statements are still both true, as i enjoyed using the glasses for the short time they lasted. unfortunately these glasses are extremely delicate. they are as delicate as expensive crystal. sadly, using these mugs to enjoy my morning coffee resulted in them lasting no more than a few days. all that it took to destroy a mug was the impact from a slight tilting onto the counter from a standing position on that same counter. the other mug shattered upon a light bump while being hand washed in the sink. it is a shame, because they are so beautiful and do really work as described. please bodum try again and make these a bit more robust?"
3,"not bad, not great","The double walled glasses are okay. They do keep beverages cold or hot longer and are comfortable to hold. However, they are not very durable. One arrived broken, which was very quickly replaced. And another one just broke inside the double walls. A bit pricey to break so quickly. Bottom line, I would bother replacing them if more break."
4,work great but too small and too fragile,I will surely enjoy these glasses for as long as they last. They keep my beer fidge cold to last gulp. I like the way they look and feel in my hand. I also wish I could pour a pint of beer of into them and am downright disappointed that I can't put 12oz with a hint of a head in them. They feel about a durable as glass made out of potato chips. I'm sure they'll be shattered in a matter of weeks and at $10 per glass I will not replace them.
5,Borosilicate Beer Glasses,"These glasses are double walled for insulation purposes. What is not emphasized is even with twice the material they weigh half as much as a regular glass. Sure $10 per is a bit steep, nonetheless, they do perform as advertised."
2,Bodum Assam Cooler/Beer Glasses,"While I like the product because of the easy grip, one of my glasses got water between the layers after washing. Has this been a problem with this glass before? My other Bodum glasses have been great."
4,Six sections cover it all,"Definitely a good book to learn ebXML and its role in the Web services world. Don't worry if you are not familiar with technologies such as SOAP, or UDDI, the book covers it all.The first section begin with an introduction to ebXML and modeling techniques, followed by the introduction to SOAP. The next five sections go in great detail with topics such as BPSS, ebXML registries/repositories, UDDI, ebXML Messaging, Security and so on.Overall, covers ebXML nicely."
1,bad quality,"this mouthpiece is very bad quality,you cannot hold out a steady note with this and is pretty hard to play.my old one is doesn't even have a brand and is much better.all the products i bought from Rico sucks and i will not be buying from them again.fortunately i was able to get a refund."
5,Practical Power,"This book holds many keys that can unlock a persons full potential. It is down to earth, practical and applicable to anyone interested in/living the Toltec teachings. The concepts and clarity offered are amazing and powerful, such that words fail to express the beauty and purpose within. One must experience this on their own!This book turned my life around. It guides one into developing their own personal power in a practical way. Reading it brought me to working with Theun, and I can honestly say that life for me has never before been so rich, fun, uplifting and joyous!"
3,Starks Slip-on,"I thought I found the perfect shoe. They needed just a little more arch support which I achieved with the Spenco Ploysorb Cross Trainer insole. I'm on my second pair of Starks and I have to say that the soles and tops hold up incredibly well. However, the Achilles heel is the padding around the ankle. The material used over the padding begins to deteriorate after a few months even though I always use a shoe horn. On my first pair, yellow padding material came through which was clearly visible while wearing. Apparently the manufacturer was made aware of the issue, because the second pair, which is now deteriorating in the same place, has less noticeable black padding coming through. The search continues."
5,Great Hat Book,"This book is a winner for anyone starting out in Millinery. It is well structured and laid out as lesson plans. There is a comprehensive section on types of headwear, millinery fabrics and materials which is followed by instructions for the design and construction of a range of basic hat styles. The typed format and slightly amateur line drawings are a little off-putting at first, but the content is excellent and the exercises are clear, well written and easy to follow. The book has enough well-rounded information to provide a solid introduction. There are even samples of different millinery materials! Highly recommended!"
2,disappointing,"This book is an unprofessionally bound wad of paper. It has absolutely no photographs in it, is all HAND-TYPED and has amateur drawings as descriptions. I can draw better than this myself. It should be clearly described and it is not.I am disappointed with this purchase and because I am in the UK and it has been sent to me from USA at fast delivery rate it is not worth the money for me to send it back. It has already cost me $10 above it's price."
2,Way too technical,I returned this book because it was much more technical than I expected. Too advanced if you're looking for a book to just teach you the basics so you can get started easily.
3,Not exactly what I expected.,"The book contains some very useful information, but I expected information on a larger variety of head gear. Worth the price, but no raves."
5,Hat Design,"I like the illustrations and the samples are great. The spiral binding is very useful, it can be opened and lays flat - good for referring to the material. All in all an excellent book for beginning milliners."
4,"Innovative, ensemble playing with Heart and Mind","This album will sneak up on you, in that it is definitely song-centric for the most part and contemplative. There are chops here, but they are mostly evident in the tight ensemble playing and unison lines between sax and guitar on some of the songs. Mr. Rosenwinkel does have his own voice on the guitar which is on display here and he displays a personal imprint that draws you in, almost conversationally."
5,A new Mozart of Jazz!,"I heard this CD on Jazz 89.5 wmot.org in Nashville one day and had to have it! I was impressed by Kurt's silky Pat Metheny like tones and the level of the tunes on this record. It's not your typical jazz CD, very contemporary, moody at times and tribal with nice guitar layers over the top. A must have and I'm looking forward to hearing more music from this artist. He could be the next Pat Metheny with the right Lyle Mays."
2,Why not just read them yourself without another person's interpretation?,"Many of Khayyam's quatrains make it seem unlikely that he is anything more than indifferent with respect to religious belief, heaven, hell, etc. In any case, there have been a wide variety of interpretations. (e.g.Christopher Hitchensincludes Khayyam's quatrains as essential reading for atheists)Why not just read them yourself and make up your own mind? Several of the best translations are all free, in the public domain, and available online through Project Gutenberg or WikiSource. Look for Fitzgerald, McCarthy, Whinfield, or even Richard Le Gallienne's paraphrase, which attempts to maintain the witiness of Khayyam.Anything is preferable to having someone else tell you ""for sure"" what is meant - even if their analysis is correct, isn't it better to figure it out for yourself?"
3,Good But A Real Stretch,"Paramahansa Yogananda came from West Bengal State, India to the US in the early 1950s. He founded an ashram in California, which is vibrant and extant. It is said that the Yogi got his insight into the Rubaiyat while in deep samadhi and this book is an outcome of his talks on the subject. The book quotes a quatrain, then gives the spiritual meaning behind key words in a section called the ""Glossary"". This is followed by a section on the ""Spiritual Interpretation"" of the quatrain, which in turn is followed by long sections called the ""Practical Application"". Many a time in the Spiritual Interpretation, Yogi Yogananda puts in interpretations to the words that just aren't there. The Practical Application usually has little to do with the quatrain or its contents, and is really an exposition of Hindu concepts and beliefs. I was born a Hindu and while this may be fine for me, objectively, starting out from the quatrain, you end up a long ways from it."
1,in search of an author,"Let it be said that ""La patografia"" definitly will be one of the most talked about books in the literature of Puerto Rico. Characteristic of such omissions is Lozada's lack of interest, bordering on outright dismissal, in any considerations derived from what has, somewhat misleadingly, come to be known as the ""play"" of literature as allegory, semantic effects and other nessesary isms in the virtual land of the correct. I disapprove. But then again I am not of that inclination and so cannot coment on it authoritatively. In any case, disapprove."
5,"A. Lozada's first novel, a pioneer in Puerto Rican letters!","Angel Lozada's first novel Patografia (from ""pato""-homosexual in Puerto Rican jargon) is the story of a young boy's coming of age in Mayagüez, a town in Puerto Rico's West Coast. As a gay boy the protagonist faces the cruel realities of accepting his own sexuality while dealing with the repression and contempt of his family and society. The novel is well written, and has a poetic language that touches the reader very deeply. Also, it presents a real, day to day image of Puerto Rican contemporary society, and its diverse social problems. Family life and the tragedies of growing up in a politically, sexually, and ""macho"" society give the protagonist a heroic character. I felt very moved (and identified) with Lozada's narrative. Above all an excellent novel, experimental, humorous, and tragic. A pioneer in Puerto Rican letters."
2,Gay hype. Literary arrogance. Next...,"This book has been hyped as THE definitive tale of Latino homosexuals growing up. It is not. It uses pretentious literary resources and a lot of chest-beating to make a point. Althouh quite funny, and yet poignant at times, a lot of it is declassé posturing. The definitive ""growing up gay and Latino"" book is yet to be written."
5,Truly Unparalleled,"Perhaps one of the best albums in the ""electronic"" genre, Dead Cities is more musical novel than mere collection of tracks. Where other albums of the like are more or less compilations of neat and nifty selections and samples, Dead Cities stands out as an album best listened to in its entirety-- as the shifts in tempo, the breakbeats, and the overall ""construction"" of it weave a story of sound. Of course, like all of FSOL, the albumis completely hit or miss. Take it from me-- you will either love it, and listen to it ceaslessly, or hate it, and complain about it endlessly. As for me, it gets better every time."
4,"dark, but deep","this is a cd that most people would listen to once only, and then say that they didn't like it, but you have to ""get into"" it to appreciate it. it will at first sound depressing and dark, but it is a mood cd. if you are there you can appreciate it fully.sometimes, when i am in the mood, there is no other cd."
2,Future Sound of London's Worst,"I am an FSOL fan, and out of 5 CDs I own by them, I rate this one last. The sound is overly harsh and droning in some places and empty and cold in others. We Have Explosive, the most well known track, is mindless techno. On a whole the sound is uncoordinated. If you are interested in techno music and thought this CD would be a good intro, think again, this album left no mark in the underground techno community and recieved no praise, it is worthless mainstream techno with only a few redeeming tracks 6 and 10. Accelerator by the Future Sound of London is better album by far and it had a true impact on the underground in its time, get it instead."
5,One of the top 10 cd's ever produced,"There's some good songs on ISDN and some good ones on Lifeforms, but this entire album is creme de la creme. It is definitely one of my favorites of all time. Each track has it's own identity, you never know where the next one is going. In a good way."
1,A Complete Disappointment,"I loved this game on my PC. When I switched over to a MAC I bought the MAC version......which doesn't work at al!!!! And the manufacturer doesn't respond or answer any questions. A complete rip off. Save your money, buy something else from somebody else."
3,Look for the lowest price you can find.,"This end table looks great in the picture, but be warned, it's pretty cheaply made. I mean, more so than I would have expected. The sides and shelves are one step above printed cardboard. Even though it doesn't call for it in the assembly instructions, I would recommend gluing every piece to give it more stability. If you have friends who consider every piece of furniture a potential chair, you will want to get something sturdier.On the plus side, its sole purpose is to sit at the end of the couch and hide the mess of newspapers and magazines, and it does that job very well. The cabinet easily keeps two week's worth of newspapers out of site. If you can find it for $30-$40 with free shipping, then it will be worth it. I have seen it for as much as $70 on other sites, and if I had paid that much for it, plus shipping, I would feel ripped off. As it is, the price was reasonable, shipping was free, and it hasn't collapsed yet, so hey, not bad. But not great."
3,Average material,"I bought this nightstand thinking that it will match my bed. When it arrived it is quite a cheap to average material only. The doors are pretty flimsy and you need to be careful everytime you open it. It's definitely small. But again, for the price, it is ok. I would have preferred it to be a little bigger and better."
5,Nightstand,I think the Winsome Beechwood Night Stand / End Table was a great buy I love it I would get another one
2,Should have Benn cheaper,"I receive items in a timely matter. When I opened up package some pieces the edges were chipped off (the wood look). Luckily able to assemble so unable to notice the chipped areas. The shelf of one was slightly warped, so needed to flip. The nightstand/end table was easy to assemble, though my electric screw driver would not work, hand to manually screw. For the price, this table is not worth it."
1,zero stars!,"I wasn't expecting fine furniture at this price, however, I also didn't expect the door to be on backwards so it opens into the nightstand. I also didn't expect screw holes on the back AND front face of the piece. I don't consider vinyl covered particle board ""wood"". If you enjoy being disappointed and irritated, order this piece right away!!"
2,Color not as expected,It serves the purpose and is very sturdy. But we were very disappointed in the color of the wood. It was not like the picture at all. We will probably end up re-staining it. It should have matched the computer stand exactly according to the picture. Too expensive to ship back or we would have.
3,good but not great,"Half of the wood on this looks finished, the other half is unpainted and unfinished. The door looks crooked no matter what I try to do to fix it. It is definitely cheaply made, but it works."
1,SOLID HARDWOODS?,"THE FRONT, INTERIOR AND SIDE PANELS ARE THIN PARTICLE BOARD COVERED WITH A GREENISH VERSION OF THE WOOD - A PLASTIC PAPER THAT DOES NOT MATCH THE WOOD FRAME. THE ONLY SOLID WOOD ARE THE FRAME AND TOP. RETURNED."
1,Winsome night stand,"I should have read the reviews before purchasing... my bad. This product is the perfect example of ""you get what you pay for."" Made out of a very lightweight pine, poorly finished and as the other reviews point out, the side panels and shelves are not made out of wood.They went together easily and will do for now but I don't see keeping them once I find some quality furniture.I would NOT purchase this product again if I had to do over again."
1,Winsome Wood End Table/Night Stand w/ Door,"This thing is a piece of crap. It looks nice in the picture, but a real surprise piece of junk, once you see it in person."
3,Should've read the other reviews,"This product was a lot flimsier than I expected, and they could've picked better pieces for the top surface. There's discoloration in spots and a spot with filler compound...that looks scratched.The predrilled holes for the magnetic catch were too close together, and the provided screws came out through the front.But, I guess it'll do."
2,Lots of songs,"$60? SIXTY DOLLARS? And they wonder why we use torrents to download this crap.Sorry, but there aren't any 2cd collections worth $60. I haven't looked else where, but wtf Amazon. Even Walmart I think sells this crap for $20.I didn't buy this btw. I'm not stupid enough to pay that kind of money for 2 cds, especially when it's this type of music."
3,"Alot covered, none very well","I have to agree with previous reviewers, this book DOES cover quite a bit. From DHTML to IIS Applications, but it has to be considered a beginner to intermediate book on Web programming in VB6. Even though the long-term viability of Web Classes is under question, the utter lack of any quality material on the ONE thing Microsoft touts as ""Web"" enabled in VB6 is extremely disappointing for a book so expensive. You can debug problems with your objects in VB6 with WebClasses that you can't perform with an ASP page and a compiled dll. Do they even mention this? No.For the interested, you can find most of the material discussed in this book by simply looking on MSDN or other web sites for articles on the subjects you're interested in. With multiple authors, that's all you will get out of this book, anyway."
2,Not well clearlly writen - too many authors,"I have 4 years VB programming experience, but after read 7 chapters of this book, I'm still feel confusing. Everything are talked a little bit, but nothing is discussed in detail.Each chapter is not well connected, this not like a book but like a huge magazine with a bunch of articles -- too many authers can mess up a good name book. They seems never talk to each other before and after writing this book. for examble, in beginning of chapter 9, it says: ""By now you have learned how Active Server Page (ASP) use components."" -- False! I never learned, at least in this book!In chapter 6 -- DHTML Application. The example application is only working in VB IDE even after making the package. It's either the author's problem or Microsoft's problem.As a ""Professional VB Web programming book"", it neither explains how to deploy a Web application well in general, nor teach you programming in detail.This book turns me to read other ASP book."
3,"Looking for WebClass Examples, and Disappointed","I was looking for solid examples of WebClass programming, and I thought this book had it. Boy was I disappointed! 100+ pages on general background, much of it going in circles the way material like that seems to, then a scant few pages giving one very anemic and sketchy example of a WebClass project. I bought this book on the strength of the other reviews here. Maybe it is strong in other areas and my investment will prove not to be a waste in the long run...I don't know yet. Just don't expect to get WebClass fluent from it!"
3,Very SQL serve-centric,"If you are just starting to use ASP and have access to a MS SQL server, then this is a good read. However, don't even consider it if you have any previous APS experience or don't have access to a SQL server. In fact, there is no mention of MS Access in the entire book! It is pratically usesless as a reference for ASP and just sits and gathers dust."
1,Poorly Written,"This book is geared towards someone new to VB. None of the chapters get into very much detail, and the examples are kept so simple as to be useless. Extremely frequent typos, spelling errors, and missing words make reading it a chore."
5,A tremendous help - very good book,"I think this book is the mother of all web programming books. It covers so much that by the end you really *can* program for the web in many different ways using many different tools. Hell, there's even a javascript and CGI tutorial in the appendices. I've read many books and it has to be a really good one for me to write a review of it!If you want to extend your VB skills into some creative web-development then this book is for you! Readers should have a firm grasp of VB itself and OOP programming.This book is always on the top of the pile!"
1,Total junk,"There seems to be a pattern with the books from Wrox. If there is more than one author on the cover, it usually stinks. This book is no exception. They try to cover too much, and end up leaving you mad because you actually spent money on something this bad. This book is nothing more than a door stop!"
2,Doesn't succeed in making you want to learn the stuff,"This book was a dissapointment and was written in such a way that caused alot of frustration and no desire to continue reading. I got further with info found on the web, which also happened to stimulate me alot more than the text in this book. Its fine if you want an overview of what can be done with VB programming - take it further yourself."
2,Where is Taiwan in the US?,"In the product description for this tool it clearly states,""Made in the USA"". On the handle of the tool it clearly states, ""Made in Taiwan"". When I ordered it I hoped it would be like the Maasdam Pow'r Pull that I have owned for thirty plus years. Oh well - it looks to be well made but Amazon clearly and apparently deliberately misled me - I'm disappointed."
3,come-along,Product made in China. Quality not great.Need telephone number for personal items. I received two products: would like to return one
2,Not yet satisfied,"When I received the covers, one of the large ones was chipped. Since it wasn't a large chip and I couldn't easily figure out how to make contact, I kept it as is. However, I noticed recently that the chip is peeling off and getting bigger. I haven't figured out yet how to return and replace. The other three burner covers seem to be fine. Do I have to return all four burner covers to get a full set or just the damaged one?"
2,NOT for learning Java!,"If you're looking to break into Java programming using your Mac, this is definately NOT the book to choose! This book is basically a single-source for all the miscellaneous docs, FAQs, and ""how would I"" type info that can already be found in Apple docs if you're willing to look for it. Book covers in brief topics such as using the various Java tools for packaging Java apps, what editors are available for the Mac, a short description of the various Mac interfaces, etc. This book is for experienced Java programmers who are interested in packaging their apps for OS X... assumes a great deal of knowledge and experience with Java."
5,It's a lifesaver,"Not too sweet, not too bland, not too strong flavor..just the perfect combination. I have been eating this for breakfast for years now, and I am not bored!!"
5,Addictive! :^),"If you like Cocoa Puffs, you will love these! The outside is crunchy, the inside has a luscious creme filling. They are delicious-tasting, vitamin enriched, and convenient if you are on-the-go.They stopped selling these in stores where I live, and I have really missed them! They used to sell out. I'm so happy to see them on Amazon!It's not just kids that love them! :^)"
5,Underrated and overlooked darkwave/synth-pop masterpiece,"This album is an 80's darkwave/synthpop fan's dream. Released in 1999, it combines the influences of acts such as The Cure, Depeche Mode and New Order with a more contemporary sound of the era. There is literally not a bad song on the album, a rare feat for most albums these days. If you are a fan of the ""80's"" synth sound, such as bands like Camouflage and the ones mentioned above, you will find this album surprisingly good."
1,"Where's the e-commerce, where's the professionality?","I can't believe the rating some people give this book. This book touches a lot of areas with little depth. The book contains a lot of filling with no practical usable things.The information on practical Java E-commerce is very limited, and if you need usable information on JSP, Application Servers, ... I suggest you buy books about the specific areas you need information on. Even if this book was intended to be a high level overview on E-commerce it would miss its mark."
4,"If it's all about Java and E-Commerce, buy this one","I am a Java developer and I bought this book as I wanted to enhance my knowledge about architecting E-Commerce systems with Java. When talking of E-Commerce, I thought like other books this book will focus on B2C E-Commerce. But I was surprised to see even a larger section deveoted to B2B E-Commerce. Now this section and the last section about M-Commerce(Smart cards etc) are probably the best sections in this book. Ok B2C section is good enough but didn't cotain anything new as far as I am concerned. There are separate sections for 'What is E-Commerce?' and 'Doing E-Commerce with Java', there is lot of theory in them and probably are there to just add weight to the book.So all in all I give this one 4-Star rating and I'll suggest this book to any Java developer looking to get his/her hands wet in E-Commerce especially B2C and M-Commerce."
2,"A bit of a bore""""","I just dont know why such high ratings on the film.I for one found it to be dragged out and just plain boring.Not much of a sci fi movie in my eyes.More dramatic and drawn on.Im sure i will get hammered for my review but i just didnt care for it.My friend said it was good so i bought it.Most times we like the same type of movies but he failed me on this one.I guess im more into the monsters and aliens type of movies.Im a big fan of the classic sci fi films that were made in the fifties.Sorry everyone,please dont be to rough one me."
5,underrated excellent sci-fi,"Excellent movie about an end of the world scenario. Multiple nuclear tests make the earth change its orbit and it is inevitably heading towards the sun. The movie concerns people's reaction to the situation. It's a tense, gripping movie that also features a very sexual performance by Janet Munro. Seeing her at her most beautiful and giving such a strong performance makes one sad that she died so young and led such a tragic life."
5,very good sci-fi flic,"this is true sf. a ""what if"" followed by the consequences interspersed with people problems. everything in this pic is well done. this is NOT a pic with special effects. it is one with good acting, sets, story, direction. suspend your disbelief and enjoy. i did."
1,Great movie bad region,"I wanted to buy a DVD copy of this very good science fiction movie. Unfortunately, They sent me a region 2 copy. This only works in Europe and not the US. This is foolish. Either label the product better or make sure you ship a us region to US addresses."
5,Why Sci-Fi Matters,The first time I saw this film was in the early Sixties on television and it left quite an impression on me. Every once in a while a film comes along that hits all of the correct notes. The primary reason this film is special is because it relies on story for it's power instead of on special effects. Genre is unimportant to whether a movie is true quality. Writing is always the most important issue followed closely by directing and acting. This movie has all three elements. Because of this it hooks you and keeps you hooked. I like many sci-fi flicks but this could quite possibly be the best.
5,One of the Unforgettable,"I'm rating this five stars in spite of the black and white film and the primitive special effects some of these kid reviewers complain about, because this is an adult science fiction story that isn't seen anymore. Allow for its age and enjoy the real humans in this story. And read the daily papers."
2,Probably only useful in VERY low humidity situations,"I used this in our bedroom in our small apartment on the water in Los Angeles. The company does make it very clear that it won't work well in high humidity environments but I would not characterize LA as being that way. With that said, the unit would pump humidified air into our apartment which only added to the heat we were trying to get rid of. People seem to have good luck in VERY low humidity locations, I figured around 50-60% was low enough...apparently not.The unit arrived scratched and damaged but the situation was remedied after a long series of e-mails and phone calls.Final words: if you live in the desert or very very dry conditions it probably works well. They don't call them swamp coolers for nothin'."
1,Not Worth It,"We bought the fan and placed it upstairs where the rooms are very hot, if its not placed on Cooler it will heat up a room. It felt like an oven and it only made the room more Humid. Once on the Cooler function, it cooled only if you sat in front of it, but not enough for what it claims to do. It works just like a fan would."
1,don't waste your money,"This thing is not any better than a fan, cooling effect is a dissapointment. It also give out a burning smell when using it. I got it yesterday from Frys and will return it today."
4,post-classical?,the record that makes the break with all previous works by mike paradinas - well-engineered and consistent - as compared to [bluff limbo] and [royal astronomy]. not terribly original when compared to the seminal works of richard james and tom jenkinson (in terms of programming) but [lunatic harness] is more than saved by its beautiful and sublime melodies.
2,Starts off strong but slowly dies towards the end.,I've always considered this album to be Mike Paradinas' silly attempt at sounding like squarepusher on prozac. It starts off at a decent pace with some fast chopped up breakbeats. Soon after the magic dies however. You end up hearing the same drumbeats sampled on several songs as well as endless repetitions that are so endlessly boring that you have to wonder when/why Mike decided to turn his gear off and call it a song. There are a couple parts of the album that are memorable. Approaching Menace is what I believe to be the album's strongest track. A good effort but not really up to par with most IDM related albums out nowadays.
2,Nothing special.,"Yet another album that concentrates on those synth-cheese melodies. Mu-Ziq just keeps on kicking the horse, and does so with less beat programming talent than Squarepusher or Venetian Snares, and less charisma than Aphex Twin, or heck, Barry Manilow. Perhaps because i'm taking it from a 2004 perspective, it doesn't measure up to modern electronica in the same vein; perhaps it's an unfair comparison. But as a person currently living in 2004, i'd download 'Hasty Boom Alert' and 'Midwinter Log' and move on to an artist with an idea that's less than 5 years old. A bland, repetitive, unimportant album that you'll barely listen to once."
3,Grabs but lets go,"3 1/2Paced irrationally, this amazing start of fluidly rendered intelligent dancescapes could have gone down as a tried and true classic, though by the end feels overlong and worn out from half-cooked experimenters consuming the latter half of this 70 minute disc."
5,Mu-Ziq to my ears!,"This is the definitive reason why one shouldn't judge a book by it's cover. The simplicity of the album cover is in direct contrast with the feel of the entire album- which is highly complex and intricately amazing. This was the first title I'd ever heard by Mu-Ziq and it's made me anxious to buy all the others I saw. You'll love how he meshes the drill of the choatic drums with beautiful ambient scapes and melodies. ""Hasty Boom Alert"" is simply gorgeous with it's counter-point of innocence and mischief, ""Catkin and Teasle"" has a great, relaxing yet surprising hip-hop feel to it. All in all, a great album for the free-spirited."
4,Best use of the snare rush since RDJ album,"It's nice to hear someone having almost as much fun with electronic music as Aphex Twin, but without the menacing presence and realization that the artist is toying with the listener. It's also mildly amusing to see how many different attempts at spelling their name can be made, so I won't even try. I'm partial to the simple, quirky, borderline inane tracks here: Blainville, My Little Beautiful, and the Secret Stair pair. I don't know what the others are saying about continuity. If a an album can be electronically ecclectic, more power to them! Every track has a certain charm...even something like ""Wannabe,"" which probably was filler, seemed haunting and creepy by the end of the song when you realize what he's saying. Electronica albums should be long, so if anything, complain that this isn't 79 minutes long. I'll agree, however, that some of the basslines are quite unorthodox."
5,Excellent introduction to SQL Server 2000 for VB Developers,"This is an excellent introduction to SQL Server 2000 for Visual Basic 6.0 developers. I used this book and Robert Vieira's Professional SQL Server 2000 Programming (Also by Wrox) to study for the Designing and Implementing Databases using Microsoft SQL Server 2000 exam (70-229). The 2 chapters on XML were especially good. Thearon does his best work when he works solo and this book is one of his best. I have his SQL Server 7 book and both books are well-written. I really like the ""Hardware Tracking"" tutorial that he follows for most of the book. This tutorial will also help with your Visual Basic skills. I have learned several new VB tricks just by following along. I hope that Thearon writes a Beginning SQL Server 2000 for Visual Basic.Net Developers."
5,The book has been marvelous!!!,"I have used this book and it has proven to be a highly resourceful Visual Basic and SQL Server book, that I am anxiously waiting for the release of Beginning VB.NET Databases by the same author!!!."
5,Excellent,"A well written book. Makes a good case for the unconditional love of God. I have a few other books to read on this topic yet, but this is definitely on my list to give to others."
2,Pass this up.,Heard her on Ice Princess soundtrack. Didn't like it. Almost folksy sounding. Other tracks aren't better. Check out Sara Overton instead.
1,DISAPOINTING!!!,This CD isn't worthy: there are only maybe 3goos songs and the rest is so bad: a kind of noise that can give you a big headache... Really don't buy this CD.
4,Very Surprisingly Good!,"I'm not a big fan of popish music but this was a nice surprise! I heard a track of hers in Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants (she is on the soundtrack) and I checked her out. Natasha Bedingfield has a nice voice and her album has catchy grooves and nice tunes. There are some really pumped up songs (such as I'm a Bomb, Frogs and Princes, If Your Gonna) that make me want to go out jogging (which in fact this is good for)."
4,A Little Sister With Talent,"Natasha Bedingfield is, for lack of a better word: pop. She's that same brand of pop that's been pushed out of the States for the more punk pop sounds of Good Charlotte and Simple Plan. However, unlike some of the pop stars from the past, she has an R&B edge that will propel her to success--the person who made the Pink comparison is right, however, it's the early ""Can't Take Me Home"" Pink style Natasha brings out with a less rough edge. Highlights include the title track ""Unwritten"" and the single ""These Words."" Natasha Bedingfield has what it takes to revive the squeaky clean pop by infusing pop and R&B. Bottom Line: If you like the Pink of Old and are itching for some clean pop...meet Natasha Bedingfield and fall in love with her soulful voice."
5,off the hook,this album was off the hook! San's lyrics AND beats are the jumpoff. He really brings your personal realationship into perspective with this cd.
3,Groovy,"Groovy Reggae with some clear R&B under tones as well. This fits well into my Jesus Music collection (along side of people like Lecrae, Bizzle, Trip Lee and Christafari). I was looking for some Jesus focused Reggae and this is it. Though I would like to find some more stuff with a more authentic sound. Good introductory album into this stuff."
1,So I kept It......,Dissatisfied! Only 1-2 songs were slightly scratched but the company stated like new but it was like old. Stand behind your rating as if you were making the purchase. You reap what you sow.
4,VICTORY!-Well Sort Of,"When I got this dvd I was so happy, BUT where is O Happy Day, Be Greatful...it's on the vhs version but not on the dvd. Im cant stand when a vhs is converted to dvd and they leave out scenes. I was so crushed that its only 3 songs per artist but in spite of that i still love it but dogg!Actual List-Rev James ClevelandWaiting On YouI Dont Feel Noways TiredCan't Nobody Do Me Like JesusDetermine To Make Heaven My Home-Shirley CeaserHe Got it All In ControlNo ChargeThis Joy(The World Didn't Give It To Me)-Walter Hawkins & The Hwkins FamilyUntil I Found The LordRight OnHe Brought MeGoin To A Place-The Clark SistersName It Claim ItIs My Living In VainHallelujah-The Mighty Clouds Of JoyMighty HighWalk Around HeavenI Came Jesus"
5,"A must see ""Gospel Treat"".....","Awesome!! I saw this as a teen when it first came out. I loved it then and more so now, because so many things have changed over the years. If you've ever been to a ""santified"" church, this will bring back those memories. It will take you back to sitting in the pew with a church fan from the nearby funeral home fanning like crazy 'cause it's hot and sticky, but you don't want to miss anything, so you sit right where you are. Or if you remember the 'midnight musicals' during the convocations...you will love this."
3,Captures the excitement of Pixars creators,"The Pixar Story is a documentary about Pixar Studios, and captures both the excitement of Pixars creators and the history of its business. It has lots of interviews with their founders and movie directors, and shows rare early works and behind the scenes videos. I found it informative, entertaining, and inspiring. Reviewed 3/13/2009 after watching instantly."
5,A very interesting story.,"Creativity and vision combine for a real life dream come true. People loving what they do working together to create a innovative product that hit the target market at the right time and place, very interesting."
5,A unprecidented inside look at the wizards behind Pixar,"The Pixar Story is an extremely well-made documentary about the beginnings, growth, troubles, and ultimate success of the most movie-for-movie successful film studios on the planet today. Much of the documentary follows John Lasseter, the heart and soul of Pixar as he goes to animation school, tests the waters of computer animation, and is ultimately booted from Disney Animation Studios for being too 'different'. But not much later, he gets his chance to do more computer animation at a branch of Lucasfilm, which eventually becomes Pixar under Steve Jobs. The documentary explains how Pixar nearly went under due to their tough early Disney contracts but in the end was bought by Disney to save Walt's animation tradition.I've watched this documentary twice and know that you will love it too!"
5,Diana Palmer,"I really don't know what to say, I just love reading Romance. Diana Palmers books take you away, I feeling like I am there.Just love Diana Palmer."
4,Good read.,"This book in and of itself was a good read. It gave a good pull on the emotion. Make sure you read ""Man of Ice"" as the characters are mentioned in this book. It is my favorite Diana Palmer."
4,ONE OF MY FAVORITE LIGHT-GUN GAMES 8 OUT OF 10,"The basic premise of Lethal Enforcers is that you are a police officer whose task is to eliminate terrorists by means of shooting to save the city. The controls work surprisingly well and are never a hassle. This game is a lot of fun of multiplayer or singe-player. It has a high replay value as well because of its wonderful arcade-style shooting. You shoot bad guys you get points or even new weapons, you shoot an innocent person and you lose a life. This game tests your reflexes and how well you pay attention to who you shoot. The graphics look great and the framerate is smooth. There is also the ability to shoot out windows which provides even more fun. This game is not without flaws though. When you play in multiplayer mode sometimes you can get confused as to whose reticle is whose or who is shooting what, and the game does dock points for missing enemies. If you love arcade shooters this game is definite must-have for you."
5,depth of line quality and character,"the sketches in this book are SO excellent for the depth of line quality and character... honest and exploratory.Because kahn is an architect, first, might be the reason this book is far too undiscovered by artists."
3,Rarely roomy,"Moderately impressive EP focuses on unnecessary but pleasurable remixes of an admittedly good tune, originally found on a great album."
3,strange pieces,The pieces are very odd shaped. I've worked with many puzzles and this was the first one like it. I loved the fairy. It looks in person just like the picture. I don't think I will do it again though because of the pieces. We'll see.
3,i disagree,"ehaskelsky says ""awesome collection of tracks the wu tang have sampled - a must for any wu tang fans"". i disagree. the collection is *not* awesome, nor is it necessarily comprised of tracks wu tang has sampled. why does he insist its a must for ""any"" wu tang fans [sic]??"
1,a beginner book with missing downloadable code,"For a beginner book. So far this book has not given meany more information about web services than a beginningbook for vb.net or c#.Few things to note,could not get to work:1/ chp4. web service proxy class example2/ chp6 and chp7 is missing both the .mdf and ldf filesthe examples WILL NOT work without it3/ chp8 is missing the show_data.mdfthe examples WILL NOT work without itFor a beginner book to be thrown out with missing filesand non working examples, there should be no excuse for thissince the examples are not even difficultOddly enough, the databases for the vb.net version for thisbook does work for the c#.I was fortunate enough to have wrox sent me the db file forchapter 7 but again I was hit with misfortune from additional missing code"
3,advance book but first 7 chapter were good,chapter 1-7 was okay very good for a beginnerwith v good explnationschapter 8 onwards the chapters just went downhillCannot get chapter 8 and chapter 9 downloads to workthere were full of bugsIt was very hard to try get the the last examples inthe few chapters to work since the explnations werevery poor too
3,Helpful but incomplete,"I learned for the first time that the object which holds the dataitem is actually a custom control itself (not clear from Ch 18 of Professional ASP.NET) and can render the dataitem if you don't use templates. However, I wished for an example showing an SqlDataReader being databound, with a row being passed into the child control (the dataitem) and rendered, with all the types being explained. There are issues with how to support properties for various columns I would like to know as well."
2,Too Many Cooks in the Kitchen,"Wow. This book is really confusing! I bought this book last year when I started working on a large project using .NET. It's been over 12 months and I'm grown to love .NET---and built-up quite a bag of tools.When I returned to this book recently to build my own custom controls, I thought it would be much more comprehensible than my first attempt. Unfortunately it wasn't. That is, until I read a few articles and an excerpt from Dino Esposito's book! Esposito's explanations were so much more clear and simple--while this book took that same subject and made it so complicated!Don't buy this book."
2,Confusing more than helpful,"As it is often the case with WROX books, this one is glued from pieces written by different authors. Reading their books is like having deja vues all the time. The synergy among chapters is quite poor.Compared to Kothari's book this one merely scratches the surface and leaves a lot of important details by the side. If I hadn't read Nikhil Kotari's book first, I would've been completely confused by this piece. Don't get me wrong---the book *does* have valuable information for developing server controls *if you are not a beginner*.Would I recommend this book? Only if you go through Nikhil Kothari's book first and then want to learn a few more tricks. Don't expect to be taught much from this book.Overall, 2 stars for inadequate coverage and a ton of typos and errors in the samples and throughout the text. I really wish WROX quit releasing hodge podge books and did a better job at reviewing them prior to publishing."
2,Examples are too simple,As the other reviewers state this book has been written by 8 authors and it clearly shows. Some of the examples provided are extremely simple and leave you wondering if building custom controls is worth all the effort whilst other examples seem to take extreme measures to produce very simple results.Chapter 5 (Template Controls) is one of the worse chapters I have ever seen in a Wrox book and left me wondering if the author had ever created a self contained at all.Wrox have listened though to the complaints regarding a lack of JavaScript integration and now provide an extra chapter on-line
2,Writing Server Controls? - Look Elsewhere.,"This is the worst, most overpriced, Wrox book I have ever purchased. If only the entire book had been of the quality of the added chapter ""JavaScript and Server Controls"" ...Now that was an excellent read. I can't believe it was the same group of authors.This book attempts to reduce a complex topic to a few lame examples and no real explanation of the concepts. I was very disappointed. I got no more information than I already had in a single chapter of ""Professional ASP.NET""...."
5,Awsome,"!!!Biofreeze Gel 3 Oz. ROLL-ON - 3 PACK-Awsome product. Attacks the area with a soothing cool layer, then penatrates the area causing a warm relieving sensation. I love it!!!"
2,"Good, but not what I'd hoped","The product is all right, but I did not get the benefit that I had hoped for. A stronger gel along with the messaging applicator would make this perfect."
5,amazing pain relief!,I have tried every lotion and cream made and this is the only one that works. It is worth every penny. I like the roll on better than the lotion since you don't get it on your hands that way. I work in retail and I'm on my feet 12 hours a day and I wouldn't be able to work without this. Instant relief! At first I could only find this at my chiropractor thanks for making it OTC. Plus the bonus is no smell! Try it you won't be disappointed!
1,not worth the money,"I haven't finished reading this book, but decided to stop reading after chapter 7. it was frustrating, I read the whole chapter and there was nothing to be learnt in the end, the component that the authors use in this chapter has nothing to do with COM+, it will run on a NT 4 machine. most of the chapters seem to have only big stories about COM+ but no solid examples or hands on code. I decided to grab ""Components for ASP"" by wrox instead, even though that book is written for NT and MTS, I hope to learn more from it."
5,Interesting and informative,Finally someone writes a very interesting book about relationships from the Ayurvedic perspective. It is an excellent book with lots of good examples.
5,One of the best books I ever read!,"This book realy holds your intrest. once I started reading it I found it very hard to put it down. I love the way the Auther keeps you in suspence, just woundering what will happen next. It is one of the best Mistery/Romance Novels I have ever read. I like it so much, I have read it at least 4 times!"
4,Harlequin Historical,This was a great fun quick read. This is the romance between Prudence and Lord Ravenscar. In this book you have a mix of healthy respectful mature romance with subplot of mystery. I was delightfully surprised - I plan to find more Deborah Simmons.
4,Very entertaining movie!,"I first caught Lucia y el Sexo on cable and was intrigued. Paz Vega is certainly a lovely actress, but flawed enough to seem real and approachable. This DVD, unrated, (ooh how salatious that sounds!!) is cool. You get the whole story, described here in other reviews, in all its unexpurgated glory. Yes, there is an erect penis or two. Yes, there is nudity, and implied oral sex. There's quite possibly the hint of analingus (Quelle horreur!), but there's nothing really pornographic about any of it. This is a story about people and their lives. It's an interesting tale and an interesting movie. Paz Vega is wonderful, the cinematography is amazing, and I would highly recommend this movie. If you liked Beyond The Clouds, you'll like this equally as well."
4,Perspectives throuh ray of passion,"This movie was my first encounter with directorJulio Medem, and I have to admit that he superbly exceeded my expectations. The cuts, angles, use of color, and natural love making yet it is seductive, and it touches one from the heart. Naturality is one of the main differences between European movies -especially late Spanish movies- and dictating Hollywood movies, where nothing is left to ponder.Here: script goes back between past and present while one gets to know how everyone may fall and rise in their own lifes and in different times. I also sensed this feeling in ""Talk to Her"" Almodovars' movie. I absolutely would suggest this movie, strong acting, intelligent shots, wonderful Spain, and music that is just right for the soul of this picture."
1,Left the erotic out of erotica!,"If you are looking for decent soft-core erotica, this film is very lame, the only provocative scene was a video playing on a television in the background. I would not recommend this film."
2,Stupidest movie I've ever seen.,"I don't know what the producers think is sexy, but this isn't it. The use of body doubles doesn't help much either."
3,"hot, but poorly developed narrative","this movie has a hot leading actress and the acting is pretty decent...but the director clearly loves the ""blue filter"" which was profoundly overused to provide some edgy, art house legitimacy to the film...and the narrative just falls apart. It was annoying...and I bought the dvd...please e-mail me if you want to take it off my hands."
4,about the movie sex and Lucia......,"This story, in short, is about Lucia's relationship with the writer of a book which in the end she went back to her writer boyfriend. There are three erotic scenes in this movie, one is in water(where she fell down a hole, the other scene is she lie on the bed and masturbate and the last one is sex encounter with her first met bookwriter boyfriend when she was drunk. This is also one of the collector's item.N/B:Movies resatricted with RCE will not pose a problem to Singaporoe as Singapore manufacture multiregion, RCE compliant DVD player. Amazon in Singapore(should they open one like the U.S) will be selling these video/DVD players as one of the products in the store. Those who buy DVD players which can't view any sex movies(RCE) are so called bad only."
2,Tiring... a trying hard erotic movie,"I watched this film because it was recommended along with Y Tu Mama Tambien. As much as it is bad to compare, Sex and Lucia doesn't even come far second to Y Tu Mama Tambien. The only credit I will have to give this movie is its cinematography and music score. The movie was altogether tiring and the sex scenes were too graphic to start with. I don't understand why the characters have to bare all! (as in everything in many times)Another thing I observed in this movie was that the lighting was too bright that it is very difficult for us foreign enthusiast to read the subtitles. The light was very much glaring to the eyes. I didn't like it.Over-all, I would only recommend this film to people who loves sex scenes inserted in an o-k story. But if you're looking for a quality sex-oriented film, this is not what you're looking for."
4,I liked it.,"This is a good movie. There is more male nudity than female nudity here. good cinematography, good character development, (which is a bit chaotic via psych perspective but nicely interconnected) and good plot. ..."
1,Purchase Regrets,"The subtitles were often very difficult to read (white letters on white background etc) and sometimes flashed on screen to quickly to read. It was too long and boring at times. Had I known that the movie had subttiles I wouldn't have purchased it. I read many reviews but none of them mentioned subtitles. Now for the movie, the storyline is not bad but not that great either. I definitely would not recommend this movie."
2,Disappointed again,"It's difficult to buy decent hot movies sight unseen. Do not buy this dvd if the sex scenes are your focus. They are few and lack much impact. The plot is uneven and felt to me as though they were making it up as they went. Very European, I suppose."
2,just aight,"had this film been a bit more focused then I could have gotten into it more.it was just trying to hard to do&say so much&yet left me even more puzzled. the directing like the story line didn't stay focused long enough for me.it had some moments,but I could take or leave it."
2,Not in English,"The product description says this movie is in English and Spanish. Not so. It is in Spanish, with English subtitles. Not the same thing. If you are fluent in Spanish, or don't mind reading subtitles while trying to watch the picture, go ahead an get it. Otherwise, save your money for something else."
3,Overrated,"A little bit overrated base on previous viewer's commentsThe story got a little murky sometimes.If you are looking for sex scenes, this is not the movie for you. It is worst than 9 1/2 weeks."
2,Not Great,"Not awful, but if you want an excuse to watch a few shots of porn and not feel guilty, then this is for you. There are some nice ideas in the movie, but they do not work together. I am not sure what the director was going for. There are many great foreign films to see before wasting your time on this. Watch some real pornography if that's what you want. Don't alibi yourself with this."
5,Paz Vega/Elena Anaya are HOT! (4.5 stars),"I try to give as professional a review as I possibly can on most movies but it may be hard when describing this one. ""Sex and Lucia"" is a little trippy and mysterious...like you are in a dream. Ladies and Gentleman it is a dream I never want to wake up from. Paz Vega and Elena Anaya are gorgeous and sizzle in this sexy, erotic drama that brings the passion. It IS quite confusing....and may be hard to understand..but the lovely ladies make up for it...now I'm ashamed..that didn't sound professional at all..."
3,good film,"The movie was a bit too long. Perhaps because of the Spanish.It could have been better edited, too many scenes were confusing and there were ...well too many scenes. This caused the movie to flow less well. Loved the topless scenes!"
4,Hang on for a wild erotic ride and a good film too!,"Unknowingly I watched the unrated version of SEX AND LUCIA and, as a result, was treated with quite a *memorable* movie experience. Don't get me wrong; I'm not adverse to sexual situations at all, I was just a little caught off guard despite the film's title. That being said, I enjoyed this film. The plot itself is quite interesting and admittedly sometimes confusing; there's a myriad of puzzle pieces scattered about that must be put in their proper sequence before there's any hope of making sense out of what's happening. The story is not told in chronological order and, worse yet, there are several plot lines that are intermingled together resulting in a jumbled mess at first glance. Take the time and effort to sort through the chaos and you may be rewarded at the end as I was. Recommended."
3,Tries to be too many things to too many people,"There are great erotic scenes in this movie. No question about it. Lucia (Paz Vega) is absolutely gorgeous. Belen (Elena Anaya) is quite pretty too. Boys and girls are all very attractive, and yes, there is full nudity on everybody.However, after the first half of the movie, something changes; the erotic/ romantic drama, changes focus, and tries to become a psychological drama/thriller. The change in pace leaves us feeling lost, bewildered, and after a while, somewhat bored.If you like the sex scenes, you might as well stop the movie when it gets psychological. If you are into romantic psychodramas, then I guess you need to watch the whole thing."
1,Not worth a Buy,"I expected explicit images of sexual activity. No ""bottoms"" down viewing was available during a sexual activity.It was a sheer waste of money"
5,not just good sex,"This is not just a movie with erotic scenes (the nanny is unbelievable), it is a satisfying and moving film as well. I watched several times just skipping forward to the sex scenes. When I finally saw the whole film I was very impressed with how good the story and acting are."
5,"Brilliant, romantic, frankly, beautifully sexual...","On the short list of erotic films that celebrate romance, the heart and mind (another: The Lover). Beautifully filmed and acted. It has the most sensual scene I've ever seen in a movie. Highly recommended."
5,Unusally brilliant film,Sex and Lucia is more than just nudity and a weird [carnal] scene. Those were the sole reasons my boyfriend asked me to purchase the movie. He thought it was porn.The movie is actually a brilliantly written suspense drama. With so many twists and turns I had to watch it twice the first time. Everytime I watch it I see something different.Paz Vega is a great actress that lights up the screen everytime she is in the frame. I film well worth viewing.
5,An amazing movie,"I guess people are molded by holywood standards and talk too much about some naked piece of flesh, but this movie is so much more than that. Relax and watch the movie and you'll enjoy it and if you have time to see the extras on the DVD you'll understand even better why it is so special. The plot, the actors, the camera and the music score are absolutely amazing. It's like drinking coffee at work (in US) for years and than you go somewhere overseas, in Italy or Spain and suddenly realize that coffee is so much more than some dirty brown water. You might not like it, but you'll have to accept that the real thing is great. Somewhere in this world some people think of acting and movies as a form of art, not just a money machine."
5,An erotic puzzle that's solved at the very end,"""Sex and Lucia"" is fantastic. I'll be watching it again for sure. If your type of movie is ""Lethal Weapon,"" you will NOT like ""Sex and Lucia."" This movie has a fantastic plot that keeps you guessing throughout. You have to think - not every thing is shown to you. You are given bits and pieces of the characters' lives and must piece it together. Despite what some have said, it's not pornographic, but certainly NOT for kids' eyes. Oh, yeah, and there's extraordinary symbollism in the show."
2,Not what I expected,In a word this movie was disappointing. It's supposed to be about beautiful Spaniards having sex on a magnificent Mediterranean island. Well there wasn't that much sex and the photography was nothing special. Add that to a plodding pace and poor plot and you don't get a very good film
1,Couldn't get past the Anti-American Sentiment,"Part of me wants to say this was a goofy, funny, low-budget and bad zombie movie that doesn't take it self too serious, BUT... Here's the run down - a Cyborg is created by a newly formed Japanese Military group in order to take revenge on America, because according to the movie, America causes all the world's wars. The cyborg is undergoing a test run in the forrest, before it is sent to America to also seek revenge for Hiroshima and while the test in underway a space ship crashes and apparently causes the dead to rise and then it's super bad special effects and terrible make up for the rest of the film. Poor direction, bad music, elementary effects - I can sometimes deal with all that, but being that this movie was made post 911 and I am American, I didn't appreciate the idea behind this film. Normally I am not one to be offended, but in this time of many terroristic possibilities, it was the deal breaker for me."
3,Disappointment,My experience with Amazon on this purchase is what I have come to expect. Every step was in the ordering and receiving the product was exceptional. The product however was not really what I was looking for. Its informative but not quite what I expected.Educational
5,Grabbed Me!,"The book just grabbed me ...Being a fan of Eastern Phylosophies and Worlds, thsi was just my best ride. China from a point of view that is heartmoving. A distinctive culture, on stage for the world.Reading this book feels like Diana Lu is telling it live to you. It's not and easy ride since it might change the way you experience a couple of things in your life. Escpcially if your are western like me.Enjoyment and understanding of global human life at large.Incredible! Must Read! Delicate prose."
5,This story grabbed me and wouldn't let go.,"When I received my review copy, I thought I would be reading ""just another rags to riches success story.""I was cynical going in.. but this story grabbed me!I thought I knew a bit about China, the Cultural Revolution, and building businesses, but Diana Lu brings a perspective I had never imagined. I have a new understanding and appreciation for Chinese culture, capitalism and the importance of global trade as a bright future for our world.""Daughter of the Yellow River"" reads like you are there. I feel like it will change the way I look at many things.. forever. A great experience.Whether you like business books, success and motivation self growth stuff, or read just for sheer enjoyment, this book is for you."
1,Height of narcissism!,"Albeit it started well and gave some insight into an average family's life in China under the Gang of Four, it quickly derailed and became self-adulatory, patronizing and boring. I could not stand her own praise of her smartness, insights about life and prettiness. What's up with all those self portraits of her in different cities? As another reviewer suggested a visit to a shrink might help. To summarize, ended up being a waste of time; Don't waste your money on this book."
1,Bizarre Revenge Fantasy,"Buy this book--if you want to read a bizarre, narcissistic revenge fantasy. Otherwise, save your money.For those who found this book or its author to be ""inspirational"": sorry, Google ""Diana Lu tax fraud"" to see what became of the author. Serving time in prison."
1,Should focus differently,The author does not explain how her business experience and her marriage went wrong because she was unaware. The author's strength is her business experiences in China. The book will be better if she focuses on it.
2,"Small, cheap, cheezy",They might be great in a play house. Not so much in my real house. I suggest passing on these.
2,Not what i expected,"These are very cute but i have no use for them. I bought thinking they were big spoon rests and was dissappointed, they are as small as a tes spoon.... thinking about returning them."
5,Buy this CD immediately,This is hands-down my most valuable CD. An absolute CLASSIC. Ni-Ten-Ichi-Ryu is one of the most addictive dnb songs I've heard yet. It never gets boring. The Hidden Camera makes you feel sinister and voyeuristic. Buy it now!
5,You buy this for Ni Ten Ichi Ryu,"While the other tracks on the disc hold up well, Ni Ten Ichi Ryu is pretty much exquisite. The pinnacle of its genre and reason alone to buy this item. It hasn't aged a second since it's release and I am still blown away by it.As side notes, look up the video (easily found via y.t.). I saw it only once on MTV's amp show years ago and was thrilled when I realized I could see it online finally. It more than does the track justice. Also, AFAIK, Photek is one guy."
4,randall wallace...uh no mate....!!,"fantastic cd: anbody that knows anything worthwhile about D&B knows photek are true pioneers of the genre and infact are one of the most talented around.. not obvious mainstream D&B at all...some people just do not get it and the last review is just that....epic release, being brought down by the preverbial ""nob"""
5,Don't let the title fool you...,"He establishes early on that he doesn't hate Oakland and it proves a touchstone for him in many ways. Al has a way of writing a sentence with such vivid description that it makes you feel like you are part of the story. As a long-time fan I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book, and I laughed out loud many times, just as I often laugh at his bi-weekly columns in the LA-by god-Times.Don't expect it to be a formal, Fodor-guide-type travel memoir. It's as much fun for the reader as many of those trips must have been for the Martinez family. Read it for the style and the interesting characters you'll meet along the way. You won't be disappointed."
1,A self-serving memoir and travelog,Don't buy this book... It contains delusional ramblings and resentments that insult the memory of the one who made Al Martinez a success.
1,"Stupid title, stupid book","A good travel writer should be perceptive enough to look beyond stereotypes. By maligning his birth city in his title, Mr. Martinez demonstrates his narrow mindedness.Like its neighbor across the bay, San Francisco, Oakland has sad and ugly neighborhoods, but it also has great beauty, including a lake with a bird sanctuary, ""Necklace of Lights"", and romantic gondola rides in the center of the city. The residential neighborhoods of Rockridge, Montclair, Crocker Highlands, Lakeside, Jack London Square and Claremont and the thriving shopping districts adjoining them make Oakland a highly desireable place to live. I could say more, but the point is to review the book.Gertrude Stein's famously misinterpreted ""There is no there there"" was said when she revisited the site of her family home, which had been razed.I would have more respect for Mr. Martinez as a travel writer if he were capable of intellectual and emotional growth amd expanding his limited view of the world."
5,Beautiful,"I'm friends with Shannon but heard her music on the radio before I ever met her. While my friends expound upon the quality of the lyrics of Bright Eyes, Modest Mouse, and all the recent ""introspective singer/songwriter"" types I know Shannon Worrell's lyrics (more like poetry) reach leaps and bounds above those of any other artist I've heard. This music is the whole package, inspiring lyricism and emotional vocals. I'm really not kidding... you'll think Sarah McLachlan and Sheryl Crow (and basically anyone else) might as well be singing MMMBop after listening to Shannon's music.PS This album is even a must have for Dave Matthews fanatics...he sings (beautifully) on several tracks."
4,Forgive For Good DVD,"Excellent material - a DVD I will watch again and again when I need a reminder that grudges are not healthy both mentally and physically and harm only the person holding the grudge. While it was a great DVD, it left me wanting more material, while great content, it seems only a taste of what can be learned from his books and seminars. I recommend it."
1,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,I EXPECTED MORE FROM THIS DVD...IT IS NOT AT ALL WHATI EXPECTED.I CANNOT RECOMMEND IT...I FELT IT WAS VERY OUTDATED.
3,Interesting history told with little interest.,"This era of history is fascinating by it's own right, but the problems of this book arise when the reader is bored to tears by its dry approach. Little human interest is inserted into the telling of the facts. Don't get me wrong, the stories told are interesting, but little presented in the book actually makes you want to read more. Better books have been written about the growth of Railroads. You will learn from this book, but it will take extra effort. 3 out of 5"
5,Great Buy! Go for this one!,"I just bought these speakers set and plugged it to my Aureal Vortex2 SuperQuad sound card.! I WAS STUNNED! Yes..! They sound great for gaming, mp3's or cd's....The surround sound makes you feel in the game....Powerfull 40 WATT sound can fill your room with good quality music! Great subwoofer delivers a stable, strong bass, and the 4 satelite speakers sound great as well I can say! Go for this one, a GOOD BUY... !!!!"
5,Great sound quality in low price range,"I have these speakers for almost three years now and I'm very satisfied with the performance. Rock solid bass (don't compare it to Harmon Kardon or JBLs) at a very low price (I bought it for $52). If your Audio CD/MP3(VBR at 160-320Kbps range) is of good quality then it will certainly give out the best sound, same is the case with Games."
1,Completely worthless,"I wrote a review about this system a while back, and I explained that I didn't like it. Now, I have even MORE complaints.I have had my speakers for 1 1/2 years. I have returned them four times, until last week. I have now thrown my system away. I am through with Lansing. The four times that I brought them back, I had the same problem every time. My amplifier on my rear speakers blew out every single time. My last set, my fourth set, died on me last week. I have had quite enough of this horrible service. If you want GOOD speakers, I suggest looking elsewhere. These speakers are for toddlers that like their products breaking on them every 4 months. I am goin for the klipsch bad boys. Those things pack 500w sound and have a dedicated center channel. Goodbye ""Mr. Unreliable"" of Altec Lansing. I am goin for the big boy speakers over at klipsch. =)"
3,Bass is weak,I tested this system at [another store] next to the CSW FPS 1500 and found that the bass was OK but not great. I prefer the bass on FPS 1500 instead.
1,Not Very Good,I was not impressed by this commentary. I found it to be very wordy and it did not give specific answers to issues that I was researching. For example; I believe that a divorced man should be able to serve as a Deacon if his divorce followed biblical guidelines. If you are divorced becase of adultery then your divorce is allowed in the teachings of the bible. This study seem to skirt the issue and not truly advise people to what the true teachings are. I found this book missing any commitment toward hard issues. Do your research and buy a good set of commentaries. You'll be glad you did. There are some really good and scholarly commentaries available.
