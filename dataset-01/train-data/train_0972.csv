5,Very enjoyable read.,This book kept me turning the pages. I had to know what the character was going to do next. I found myself wanting to hurry from work just so I could read more. Very well written as is all of her books.
5,Read this book and let yourself live and breath the music.,In the wonderful world of Marc Antiono Trechi it's all balls and glamor untill he makes a startling dicorvery that will change his life forever. Some things are made to be left alone. But after and unexpected tragety he is forced to leave his easy life behind and become a man. When his father(brother) Carlo pulls a horrable plan on Tonio he is determined to keep Tonio away from his life. Tonio will not let that happen... This book compleatly spellbinded me and I would be terrably annoyed and shocked if someone told me that they did not enjoy this book.
3,You should know...,"I bought this book because I am a singer. Rice really did her research and placed the fictional characters in a historically accurate setting. The book deals a lot with singing and the joys and challenges of music. I really like these aspects and also the vivid descriptions of beautiful sights in Italy. What you should know about this book is that is contains a lot of homoeroticism. That element became a little distracting to me. I will say that I feel that true art should sometimes make us feel a little uncomfortable. Rice definately delivers the discomfort in this book. I also felt like there was a long, long set up for the climax of the book which comes at the very end with not a lot of falling action. It took me awhile to get through it. For me it was not an ""I can't put it down"" book."
3,Historically Interesting & Occasionally Moving,"This was a well-written story about the lives of the castrati in 18th century Italy, a dazzlingly clever story of revenge, it's patient execution and corruption. The non-consensual sex scenes between old men and young boys popped up a bit more frequently than historical accuracy would require, and some of the peripheral characters entered and faded without reason, but overall this was a good read."
4,Unexpected,"It is a great novel, although it does not follow the gothic trend in Rice's books but the plot is great and the main's character story in itself is also amazing."
3,Boring,"Okay. How obvious was the plot on this one? I mean, I could figure out the plot as soon as Carlo came back from the Middle East. Its not that hard to figure out. And of course Tonio is going to become a world famous opera singer. It wouldn't be a story with out that. Its blah blah blah. And the constant description of guys having sex. I get the point after the first time description. I would say the same after a guy and a girl having sex. My advice is that if you have extra time read it. But if not, don't bother. The research that went into it was excellent."
2,Too many words,"I like Anne Rice's writing. She's a master of plot and description, but in this case she over-wrote, filling page after page with unnecessary words. The relationship between the main character, Tonio, and Carlo didn't ring true. Carlo's motivation and actions weren't explained well enough to be understood by the reader. The numerous graphic sex scenes were overdone, and the character Christina was not developed as she should have been. Although the ending was somewhat satisfying, the reader is left hanging, with the feeling that serious problems lay ahead. All in all, a disappointment."
5,One of Rice's best,"I love this book. I will say it again, I LOVE THIS BOOK. I have probably read it five times. As with all of Rice's books, her characters are so believable. When I first became interested in Anne Rice it was for her Mayfair Witches and Vampire Chronicles. This is probably my second favorite book of hers next to The Witching Hour. Read this book....do it!"
4,Not a bad book...,"This book was a little on-going, bla-bla-bla-ish, but overall it was ok..the sex scenes were a little graphic for such a touchy subject."
4,One Of Rice's Two Best Books,"Out of everything Anne Rice has written in a thirty-year career of widely-varying quality, only Interview With A Vampire outranks this novel. Set in the realm of music in eighteenth-century Italy among the fabled castrati, the story here is about a young man named Antonio, a beautiful boy with an angelic face and a perfect singing voice. Antonio's early life is spent in a secluded villa, surrounded by the glories of music, and dominated by a loving but strangely reticent elderly father figure, a melancholy, alcoholic mother, and a mysterious man whose intrusions into Antonio's childhood disrupted the fabric of life within his entire family. The revelation of exactly who this mysterious, bitterly angry man happens to be provides the heat in the first half of this book. Antonio's fate and his rise to prominence among the musical hierarchy make up the heart of this tale of revenge, glory, love, and tragedy in the age of opera."
5,I re-read it all the time!,The first time I read this book it took me 2 days. I thought it was twisted and beautiful. It has sort of Count of Monte Cristo feel to it that keeps you on the edge wondering if revenge would ever take place. I also absolutly love the way that Anne Rice seems to bring old world Italy alive in my mind. When ever I am between books I re-read it and I love it more each time. Thank you Anne!
5,a symphony of darkness and light blending into pure beauty,"anne rice has done it again. In Cry To Heaven, we meet a cast of characters that epitomize beauty. Despite the darkness lurking behind each and every corner, the pure innocence of the eunichs creates a blissful symphony of beauty."
5,Heavenly!,"This is without a doubt Anne Rice's best-ever book. What a world she re-creates here with her shimmering prose style and impeccable historical research. No-holds-barred, for sure. The book's introduction, which characterizes this enthralling story as depicting ""the decadence beneath the shimmering surface of Venice,"" describes the novel eloquently.""Cry to Heaven"" opens up the world of 18th-century Venetian opera in a way that no other book of its kind has done. It is an enduring classic that should be on the bookshelf of any student or scholar of baroque music.Sarah Bruce KellyAuthor of THE RED PRIEST'S ANNINA"
5,By far my favorite Anne Rice book,"This is an amazing decadent read. I just wanted the story to go and on. It has broken my heart to learn that my most favorite author has given up writing such incredible books.Feb 2010Still my favorite Rice book ( and that's saying something considering she's written so may amazing ones). I've even read ""Christ the Lord: Out of Egypt"", and altough not my usual choice for reading, found it to be a wonderful book. Thank you Anne. I look forward to many more years of reading your books."
4,Surprisingly Interesting,"I picked this book up expecting something of the usual sort from Anne Rice. That being gothic, dark and mysterious. Instead I was drawn into a world beyond expectations. I had no idea that I'd be so interested in the underbelly of classical opera that sets the stage for this story!! I generally find Rice to be painfully detail-oriented in her writing but this was beyond that. For anyone into a good dark, sensual, and interesting novelization of an historical nature do yourself a favor and read this book. It's definitely not what your used to reading."
2,boring,"I am sorry, but I can't stand this book. The premise was intriguing and Anne is definately the one author who can pull it off, which is why the dullness of this book is such a disappointment. She piles details upon details, heaps on the prose, and drags the whole tale out. I was actually skipping ahead to see how it ends and if it was worth the effort to finish. Very slow to warm up to in the biginning, then a sagging dragging middle and finally a pretty good end. Sad, poetic, even haunting at times? Yes. Her prose is not pulp fiction, it is literary and lovely. But less is more! And this book could have been IMHO 10 times better if a few dozen pages were shaved off, a few scenes shortened or cut, and a few details glossed over or omitted altogether.I started this one on vaction--maybe the atmosphere was too light for such a zaftig book? Or maybe I am just making excuses for this latest effort by Rice?She's seen better days and so have I!"
1,cry to heaven,"I read the first 50 or 60 pages of this book and was so repulsed by the homosexual act and all of the description of it that I simply could not continue reading it. It had been said to be the ""best book ever"" by a friend. Not for me. I threw it in the garbage. I did not know or realize this would be this kind of story."
2,"Well written, but at times very disturbing.","I would have really liked Cry to Heaven if the ""love"" scene with Tonio and that girl wasn't in the book. It was really frightening the way he forced her into bed with him, and it definately made me dislike the character. And the fact that she forgives him so quickly as if he didn't do anything wrong was really unrealistic; sickening even. I'm surprised Christina or whatever her name was wasn't totally psychologically damaged after what he did to her. I noticed a lot of Anne Rice's books contain a lot of stuff. Maybe she should rethink doing scenes like that in her future books."
2,Love/Hate Relationship With Anne Rice,"The book ""Cry To Heaven"" I thought was beautifully set-up with stylistic prose and tons of eroticsm. I just love how Anne Rice adds a touch of sexuality to everything she writes; but I must admit, I could care less for her plots. ""Cry To Heaven"" lagged on so much and was sooooooo pointless, by the time I reached the end of the book, I felt like crying to heaven myself (in frustration). I can say the same for the other three novels I've read: ""Interview With The Vampire"", ""The Vampire Lestat"" & ""The Witching Hour"". Completely ... foolish; and you ask why I continue to read her books? Because she is the only author I know who does not repress sexuality in all it's glory. As for those of you who felt uncomfortable about the book's countless homoeroticsm, I only have one thing to say: Get over it!..."
4,Intriguing treatment of an interesting subject,"I have never been much of an Anne Rice fan, having to force my way through Interview with the Vampire. But, as an avid opera fan, I was immediately attracted to the subject matter of this Rice book: the castrati. Having been unable to find much about the castrati in my encyclopedias, I thought reading a novel about them might be quite interesting.Ms. Rice does not disappoint in her treatment of this intriguing topic. I usually do not like calling any piece of writing a page-turner, but I must admit that I could notput this book down. The characters immediately grabbed my attention and I was compelled to follow them to the end of their stories.I am certain that Rice fans will like this book. But I would like to recommend it to anyone interested in opera, vocal singing, and the castrati."
5,Cry To Heaven,Interesting and unusual novel about the antiquated and controversial practice of castrating young boys prior to puberty in order to preserve their pure soprano voices so they could continue to sing in church choirs and for royalty.Regarding my experience with Amazon - I would give this seller five stars for his exceptional service. The book was shipped out right away and I had it within two days of the order placement.
3,Takes a lot to hold your attention.,"Until now I thought I'd found my all-time favourite author......I've been reading Anne Rice's Vampire chronicles and thought this would be equally satisfying but I was rather disappointed that the book was unable to hold my attention at several points. It took me nearly a month to finish reading it compared to my usual 3 day read with Anne Rice's vampire novels. You can tell she's done a very good research (as usual) on eighteenth century castrati but I found the story lacking Anne's usual mystic touch of the dark. Tonio Treschi's sexuality is very muddled, some of his erotic scenes gave my stomache a wierd churning sensation. A man together with another man is not natural! And then to be able to go back to sharing his bed with another woman before settling for both???!!!All in all a good before bed read, but other than that you need to be really bored to pick up this book!"
4,Good Book!,"I was looking for something to read, and I'm a huge fan of Anne Rice...I was quite surprised how I enjoyed it."
5,Great read,"Typical of all Rice's work, I enjoy her maticulous attention to details. Her writing is addictive reading. Now, if she 'll only finish her trilogy of the story of Christ."
1,Not a great CD,There is lots of Iraqi Jewish Music out there keep looking.This is not great.No disrespect to the performers but there are much better to be had.A document but not entertaining.
5,It tells you a lot about him and high school football.,"Emmitt Smith loved football from the time he was a baby. He would play and sometimes be too big to be able to play. In high school, he was a star running back but he had a time where he fumbled a lot. After he went into the NFL draft, the Cowboys, unlike many other teams, thought even though Emmitt didn't have very much speed, he could still be a really good running back. So the Cowboys were able to pick him as the 21st player picked. He became a star and led the Cowboys to three Superbowl victories and won four rushing titles for himself. It is a good book because it tells you about him at every time of his life."
4,What if Tarzan were real...?,"It is difficult to describe the story of this novel without spoiling it. Ras Tyger is the lord of the Jungle. His mother was an ape, his father was God. He lives a savage life in the jungle, tormenting the native warriors while seducing their women. Then events lead him to begin a seach for the truth of his origins.It's an interesting take on the Tarzan legend, but not for the easily offended. Farmer gives Burroughs a run for is money as far as action and adventure are concerned. Definitely not for children, but if you love the Tarzan character, give it a shot."
1,What happened to the last review I wrote?,"Hi,I submitted a review for this book last month. Why wasn't it posted?"
2,Unnecessarily quite frustrating,"Yes, the orchestral playing is quite impressive. Yes, Bernstein truly demonstrates his love for this music through this performance. Yes, but...After listening to both works, it was like walking onto a train at rush hour expecting the express train yet finding out later to my dismay that it is really a local train.This is Mozart. You need more thrust, or spontaneity, or whatever you want to call it. Berntein`s tempi are too stilted for me, especially the beginning of No. 40. Although he went a little overboard in his diatribe, I believe ELN was correct in explaining the complete disappearance of emotion and urgency from the first movement of No.40 because of its slow pace (8 3/4 minutes).Sorry. All the plusses I mentioned above just pale compared to the unnecessary plodding of some of this CD`s movements.This CD just doesn`t cut it. Especially with the huge competition out there re: these two symphonies."
3,nice for short term,"this are good goggles for the price but they don't last long so if you are looking for something more sturdy go with spido...also, i enjoyed putting them together but if you're not the technical/likes to build type don't buy this"
4,best googles,I love this googles they are just the best.But the only bad thing is that the rubber band eventually will get gluee and sticky. But nothing that I would trade for any other googles!
1,Can Cause Bruising Around The Eye.,"I could not be more unsatisfied with these goggles. I thought the worst that could happen is the goggles would leak. I could not have been more wrong. All I did was assemble the goggles and try them on. I never even swam with them. After I took them off, I looked in the mirror and found a bruise surrounding my right eye. So far this bruise has lasted a week. I hope these goggles did not cause permanent damage to my eye. Beware!"
1,I don't understand the hype.,"After reading that many swimmers like these goggles, I gave them a try. No matter how I position them, or how loose or tight I make them, they leak like crazy."
5,Best Goggles I have used,"I started swimming in elementary school, continued through middle and high school, swam division 1 in college and have tried at least 30 different types of goggles. These are the best...you just need to put them together yourself. Once you get them to the right size (not pinching your nose) you will become a believer.Note: you will have sore eye sockets the first 2-3 times you wear them, but that quickly goes away."
5,the Original!!!,simple cheap effective. bottom line these just work and thousands of Pro's can't be wrong. I don't have anything more to say about these fantastic goggles
3,Above-average thumb drive,"I like mine. It's a thumb-drive. It's pretty big. Reasonably fast. The cap hasn't loosened, fallen off, or been lost. (Yet.)I wasn't sure having a ""water resistant"" USB thumb drive was that valuable, until a client spilled a full cup of coffee on it.That said, it could use a few improvements. First, it needs a sturdier keyring loop.Second, the neck strap it ships with is an uncomfortable bit of thin plastic-type cord. It's better for whipping your little brother than it is for dangling a thumb-drive from your neck. The cord just hangs there when you're using the drive too. Annoying. (I replaced it with the nylon cord + plastic connector from a Sandisk drive.)And last, it sounds as though it needs to ship with a couple of spare caps."
3,It's okay,"This product works good at taking off eye shadow, but it misses the mark on completely taking off eye liner and mascara. Next time I will buy the makeup remover from Clinique for lids, lashes and lips. I have used it and it works better."
3,Good Stuff but NOT for the newbie,"This book is good if you have a working knowledge of Linux. There are many things that I have learned through studying this book (I am on page 475) but there are MANY things that the author tells you can be done with giving examples or guiding you through the process. So this is not the book for the guy who has never touched Linux. If you know what you are doing in Linux and want to sharpen your skills, this book might be the ticket. For the total Linux Master Tech, this book is probably beneath you. Good only for those of us stuck somewhere in between."
5,Best all-around,"Yes, there are better books for virtually every topic.From apache to sendmail to whatever, you have at least half a dozen 300-1000 pages books that will make you a specialist in that area.But do you have the time, money or desire to read all that? Do you need to be an expert in this or that? Do you even know what field you need to be an expert in?Negus' RH Bibles series cover it all. Everything you need to know to get every subsystem working, from email to wireless LAN. It turns a handful of CDs into a full blown server that can do everything short of mixing drinks for you!And just like good wine, it keeps getting better with time. Actually, it's not that good of an analogy :-) Don't keep your old Bible, buy the new one, the new chapters are worth it.Thank you Mr. Negus for writing this great reference book!"
2,Disappointing,"This book struck me as very superficial. The author attempts to cover a very wide spectrum and, as a result, detail is sorely lacking. One example will suffice. The author describes the purpose of kudzu, ending with ""[I]f you like, you can also start kudzu while Red Hat Linux is running"" --- and fails to tell you how to start kudzu. Excuse me, but what's the point of failing to provide basic information?The index is also very weakOn the whole, I think one can do much better than this book.Jerry"
2,Too basic even for a newbie,This book will definetely help you install Red Hat if you are a newbie BUT you won't learn anything from it... the book is not good as a reference not to learn... Look for something else
2,"So far, not helpful.","I'm working on installing Linux in the same hard drive as Windows, and I'm running into some difficulty partitioning my disk. This book's description of that process was not at all helpful. It did say I was going to have to run a utility called fips, but its explanation of why I needed to run fips was so tortuously incoherent that I couldn't tell what fips was supposed to do for me, or how to run it to get the results I wanted. I had to go out to the Red Hat site to find out that fips would reduce the size of the Windows partition on my hard drive, and that using it was like playing Russian roulette with my Windows installation. I really don't know if the rest of the book is as bad because I haven't managed to get myself successfully install Linux using the instructions in this book.I'm still in the market for a good book on Red Hat Linux. Anyone know of one?"
2,Rehash of Red Hat 7.2 Bible,"If you have the book for Red Hat 7.2, you don't need to buy this book. The author essentially just rehashes the the old book and adds some new featues. Totally a waste of money. Even if you did not buy the old book, this book does not offer any deep insight. If your a beginner, this book may be for you, but if you want to dig deeper, look somewhere else."
1,do not buy this,"Do not recommend. It is very inexpensive, you get what you pay for Cost was $4.00 and S&H $5.00 arriving in an envelope. After using the mop it left red dust in place of real dust.Very disappointed."
5,Excellent folklore for vegetable fans,"100 Vegetables and Where They Came From text treatment of the vegetable picks a hundred vegetables from around the world and shares their stories of development and consumption. Read here about the Pennsylvania Winter Luxury squash which can be eaten like an apple, or the Botswana cowpea, which is a creamy dish in Africa. Excellent folklore for vegetable fans."
5,"A Groom in Her Stocking, Barbara Dunlop","Lindsay Parker's fortune's been told. She's going to marry Robert. Unfortunately, Bobby's a creep who turns her stomach. And speaking of stomachs, she seems to have butterflies in hers every time RJ Webster's around. So how's a girl supposed to fight her destiny?Barbara Dunlop tells a fun story that will keep you laughing as the jingle bells rock!"
1,Sucks!,"This movie was really LAME!!!A waste of money. I love these types of movies, but this was really bad... Only plus was the hot chick....Save your money!!!!!"
3,An ok way to kill some time,"I have been reading a lot of raving reviews here on Amazon about this flick, but I have a good feeling that some of them are linked to the film makers, so I didn't put my expectations to high for this one. The story was pretty good, although pretty predictable, and I thought the acting was above par for an indie horror movie like this one. My biggest complaint is about the gore and special effects, they kinda sucked here. The CGI completely ruined a lot of the kills. I listened to the commentary and you could tell that the film makers were not happy with the effects either. I can watch a movie with the worst acting and dumbest story on earth, but if there are cool kills and great special effects, I will watch it a hundred times. This movie was an ok way too kill 1 1/2 hours. I recommend renting before buying."
1,not to gd,"This movie did not make any since at all, I did not like the movie it was not even scary at all but that's how everybody makes their money some how, I watched the movie 2 times try to make since out of it but it was still the same, so I don't think no one should buy this movie I'm telling the truth it is not any gd at all thanks a lot."
2,What a Mess,"The movie is a complete, hot, stinky mess, and yes the ending positioned the movie for a sequel."
3,it's just ok,"this movie is just ok, not what I expected to be. I mean when you see the preview of it, 'it looks great' there's really not much gory except for the incident which takes place years ago on a film. I'm just glad I waited til the price went down before buying it, but overall it's ok to watch."
3,Baby Face is bad,Baby Face is bad. Lots of gore and scary moments. Recommended for the strong hearted.
4,Great B-horror flick about B-horror flicks,"One part Friday the 13th, one part In the Mouth of Madness, and one part Blair Witch. Stir until mixture helps a crappy movie one of the scariest movies I've seen in a while.Gratuitous T & A helps out too."
3,Instructions?,"Managed to put it up ok, but lacks instructions or parts, or both. The paper hangers underneath had no clear stable way to mount them. Shiny though."
1,disc not readable,the disc was never readable or mountable on my powerbook g4 running 10.4.8swissbit support finally emailed me a disc repair software tool but the disc again was unreadable whenever connected to any computer. the best solution swissbit could provide was to Please mail or call Victorinox for further instructions.hopefully Victorinox will do better and replace it with a working device. very unhappy with this product and it seems I am not alone
4,Men really need it !,"I loved this interesting book. I've found a french translation named : ""Le Réveil du Lion : L'Homme dans la force de son héritage"".You can find it at www.eergeneve.ch or to their email: info@eeergeneve.ch"
5,A great book without falling victim to political correctness,"Gordon Dalbey does a great job of hitting on key issues of masculinity, without making excuses for some of the fundamental issues of our generation. It's a refreshing look at the beauty of the strength inherent in maleness. A great, nonjudgmental call to revisit our masculinity and embrace it. His writing flows very nicely and makes the book a satisfying read."
2,Not for me,"I tried to like it but couldn't, I just found this book very hard to follow. It is very philosophical in nature and I couldnt relate any of that to my own experiences. I also feel that it was overlooked that men have different temperaments/personality types. Thus heavily promoting a key extroverted quality of ""initiative"" as being a desirable trait of masculinity is not feasible for everyone. Lastly I didn't like his style of writing that used a lot of old outdated words."
5,Another super book from Judy,"Its a warm, tender, funny book along with some feistiness too. Judy shows you don't have to have the same bloodline to be a family. JD and Rachel are perfect for each other and the secondary characters Madge and Bluey are a delight. Rachel discovers some much needed self-esteem from Madge and JD from cooking and ranching lessons. Sickness invades the ranch from the flu to JD's foot in mouth disease, but all is well in the end and we get to sample Rachel's cooking efforts by way of chocolate cake, peach cobler and carrot cake. Judy brings a smile to your face along with a chuckle and a grin and some head shaking at JD's ""oops"" that come out of his mouth, but of course Rachel tames her cowboy in the end. Its another keeper. Good job Judy - keep em coming!"
1,Don't bother,If you can't dance you can't dance. If you got rhythm you can make up your own moves in a dance club. I didn't get anything from this video that i would ever use in a club.
2,Outdated dance moves,This dance DVD doesn't teach many moves. I could hardly use any of them in today's dance club. The pace of the moves is too slow and doesn't match the beat of the most popular music. Price is high for something like this. Should have bought a different one.
5,dancing in clubs,"I wanted to learn to dance solely to pick up some moves I can use in clubs. I had no previous dancing experience whatsoever and was glad to see these guys break all the moves down into easily learnable steps. The first part of the DVD teaches you a bunch of club moves. Most of these moves are hot, maybe only 1 or 2 I can't see myself doing. it was helpful to see the guys, after teaching each move, dancing with the girls with each of these moves. Part 2 of the DVD is all about dancing with the girl and turning up the heat. They also show you how to approach girls dancing and how to go from starting to dance with them all the way to grinding and all the stuff in between. I just mimic exactly what he does for those 4 minutes and the girls I dance with are all about it. I definitely recommend this DVD to any guy who wants to learn how to dance in the clubs because it will be a huge help."
3,O.K. for some dance moves,"The instruction techniques are ok, some easy to follow & learn & some not so easy. I found it somewhat difficult to apply the dance moves to the beat of some songs. Unfortunately there isn't much else out there instructional wise."
1,Can't get it to play,"No matter what I do, the menu comes up for ""play"" or ""moves""but it won't start either one when I load the dvd;that's NOT criticism of the DVD nor the seller, i just can't get it to play on my system!"
1,dont get suckered,"the 5-star reviews are fake. they read like ad copy and and if you check the ""reviewer"" profiles - theyre blank except for the one review of this DVD.the dance moves are a joke. the video is horrible. the dancers are horrible. the music is horrible. the advice is lame.Instead of buying this video - next time you go to the club, look for the worst dancers (the dudes shuffling back and forth from one foot to another - not on beat to the music) and immitate them.p.s. (added later) try the ""make it happen"" dvd instead. its also very basic. but it shows you the right moves and gives good instruction."
4,Nightclub Dance Series Review,I found this DVD to be quite good. The instructions were good and easy to follow. Some of the moves were dumb and you wouldn't use them at all. Over all it delivered what it promised and that's to show you simple dance moves. This is an ideal DVD for beginners.
5,definitely worth it!,I'm really glad I made this purchase. I've wanted to take dance classes for a while but I didn't have the time nor the money. A friend recommended that I buy a DVD. After looking around I chose this one since it looked like it was going to be more my style. I was impressed with the moves and especially the instruction. Looking forward to vol 2.
2,bad but not horrible,"if you know absolutely nothing about dancing then you could derive some benefit from this. my recommendation is go for classes or simply watch some youtube clips by typing in some search like ""hip hop tutorial"" and you should be well on your way in a month or so ..."
2,Not my cup of tea!,Has a 80/90's feel to it and some of the dance moves are very basic as well as look cheesy.
1,Simply bad! you'll learn nothing..,This was a waste of money. I got this DVD for $28 and learned nothing. It's pretty much a scam.. You'd learn by going to a club one time more that what this DVD would ever teach you.I feel they made this DVD in one hour.. seriously!!
2,Eh,The steps are basic and boring. It is mostly centered around club dancing with girls. At the end they bring in girls to dance with them. At the very end of the DVD they have girls they interviewed about what they like or don't like guys to do in a club as far as approaching them and such. Makes no sense at all to the content of the DVD. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! It was a waste of money and there are better ones out there.
3,Cake Mix for Cookies for beginners,"I find that the recipes are very basic. I tried a recipe with my 9 year old son...my husband immediately picked up on the fact that something was different about the recipe. When I filled him in that I used cake mix, he said that that explained everything. I think to cook with a child and in allowing them to feel comfortable in the kitchen, this is a good start. Just not impressed as a whole."
3,Cake Mix Cookies: More Than 175 Delectable Cookie Recipes That Begin With a Box of Cake Mix,"I tried a couple of recipes for the cookies. The chocolate chip cookies were horrible, the plain yellow cake mix cookies were okay. The chocolate cake mix with peanut butter on top was good. In the end, it's probably better to make your own from scratch."
5,Just wonderful recipes,"I'm no foodie, but I love good food and am always on the lookout for simple recipes. I've been making cake mix cookies for years but these go well beyond anything I've come across before. The cranberry caramel bars are outstanding and the gingerbread softies taste nothing like a cake mix cookie--soft, cake like cookies made with cream cheese and butter that have all the flavor of gingerbread (they kept especially well, too). But the big fun was the pumpkin fluff whoopie pies I made with my granddaughters this weekend--great big soft pumpkin cookies sandwiched with a spiced marshmallow fluff filling. A lot of fun to make (but be prepared to get sticky--the kids will love it) but grand, old-fashioned fun and flavor to eat. A big (sticky) thumbs up to the author!"
4,A great book for your money,This book is loaded with simple recipes that all sound great! I have tried more than one of them and they have all come out fantastic. The cook times and everything in the book have been exactly correct. My only wish is that it had photos of the cookies inside the book instead of just the recipes. I think it's a great investment for anyone who enjoys baking... especially for the holidays!
5,"Awsome Cookbook, Highly Recommend!","Wow! Such jummy recipes! I have done just about half of this book recipes. They have all come out perfect and delicious. I have used it for cookie exchange, holidays, family gatherings etc...A very useful book when you want to whip up something pretty fast and tasty. It is also great for those who don't want to spend to much time in the kitchen. Full proof recipes!"
5,Lots of fun!,"My grandma was looking for an activity for us to do together and she bought this book because she knows I love baking, and thought this is something easy we could do together. It was a great book! She picked out five recipes for us to try out the first afternoon, and we had the first one mixed up before the oven was preheated! One of the cookies was super simple (add choc chips to cake mix with some oil), and you could tell that it was a cake mix, but the rest you wouldn't be able to tell at all. They were delicious! We've already picked out five more recipes for next time. Try it for yourself!LindseyBlog: [...]"
5,Fabulous! Ranks right up there with her '70s hits!,"Two years ago, I heard Gloria Gaynor's album. I loved and STILL love ALL of IT! Gloria sounds superb on all these modern dance numbers! One song I can't stop playing is All The Man That I Need, which is so catchy and has the funkiest dance groove given to her since her I Will Survive days. Just No Other Way, I Wish You Love, and the 1979-sounding Just Keep Thinking about You just shows her in her finest form. I liked the Rob Fusari produced songs. This is the same guy that's done Will Smith and Destiny Child's songs and here he is with Gloria, giving her some nice songs too. The European dance producers on here did a fine job giving Gloria some dynamite songs to fit with the energy of her voice. This ranks right up there with her best hits of the late '70s, bringing her right into the millennium. A very danceable and entertaining album from one of the great divas of dance music!!!! You've still got it, girl!!!!!"

2,They aren't waterproof!,"These are flexible light-weight gloves, useful for outdoor work and fairly rugged. But they are not waterproof...dip a finger in water for longer than a second, and you have a wet finger."
1,Poorly Made Gloves,"First of all, these gloves are not waterproof. Secondly, the finger tips on both of my gloves have ripped open after using the gloves for normal gardening work. I spoke with customer service three times and after spending a few dollars to ship the defective item to the manufacturer, the rep said that they would send a replacement pair. No replacement received. Time and money wasted on these expensive, poorly made gloves."
4,Gloves wear out - it happens and I accept it.,"I buy a new pair of these gloves at least every other year. I still rate them four stars, despite the fact that they wear out, because in the past I was buying new pairs of other brands' gloves at least every year, if not more often. I live and work on a farm, and I use these gloves in the winter when filling water troughs, hauling water buckets, draining hoses, and my hands never get wet. They're grippy enough that I can use them when training horses (they don't slip on the reins) and they're warm enough that I can teach horseback riding lessons for hours in them without getting cold.In order for them to be comfortable and breathable, the material they're made of is going to wear out. I completely accept this, and will order again since there are no other gloves on the market that keep my hands warm AND dry when I accidentally dunk my hand in a water bucket in -20 windchills..."
2,overpiced. so so qualty.,Dissapointed with these gloves. They're rather expensive for what they are. The quality just isn't there. I didn't find them to be water proof either.
3,Good gloves - but don't last,"I haven't done the scientific test of submerging my fingers for a prolonged period, but I have so far found my gloves to be waterproof - including when fishing pieces of ice out of our barely-frozen pond. The tips of my fingers were definitely submerged, albeit just for a fraction of a second. The only wetness I've encountered inside the glove has been from perspiration. The gloves are comfortable and sufficiently warm. Shop around, some places will sell a particular size/color for much cheaper. I would have preferred green or clay, but I managed to get a black pair in XL for under $13, and I couldn't pass up that deal.I am downgrading this review after a year. These gloves did not hold up as well as expected and because they do not breathe, they developed a sweat odor inside that will not go away with washing. Once the gloves have this smell, it will make your hands smell bad if you wear them even briefly."
4,Somewhere in the middle,"I am not a fan of Perlman and have seen him live and been very disappointed, but I disagree with the review that this CD was horrible. I found the music to be well performed by both Perlman and the Paris Orchestra. I do beleive that Perlman is not the master everyone wants or beleives him to be, but he did a good job with this recording. While not a must has for a collection of the greatest recordings, the CD would make a fine addition to most collections."
3,Handy.,"It's a handy little stool. One that is great for people who need to not sit so high off of the ground. It's not the most durable. I use it for playing guitar, though and tend to move quite a bit while I'm playing. Movement causes the thumbscrew to loosen and the seat swivels by the end of a couple of songs - nothing dangerous. Given that the seating platform is cardboard, I doubt it will last for long. It's inexpensive for the quality. The company ships promptly."
5,FINALLY!!,"i couldnt find this in ANY store! it is my absolute favorite and i was desperate! so glad i found it here. it was more than id have liked to pay, but i guess value is determined by demand and i DEMAND i have bonnie bell dr. pepper lip gloss! ; }"
1,I am surprised Amazon would carry a dollar store item!,"I bought this for my son who is into pin art, puddy, electronics ect. I chose this one because I was buying other stuff and got free shipping with it. There was no picture so I was going on Amazon Faith...oops.I wish I had chosen the other more expensive one and just paid the shipping. When I received it I was SHOCKED at the cheapness of it. Tiny and plastic with balls smaller than marbles! Be smart save your money don't buy this one."
2,Cheap construction,Picture makes it look much more substantial than it is. Balls are much smaller than expected and everything else is plastic
1,This is a dud,"Beware of this Newton's Cradle. I bought it at the Tech Museum of Innovation (San Jose, CA). After bringing it home, we opened the sealed box and discovered that all the nylon lines were hopelessly tangled up. Our choice is to throw it away or cut off all the lines and re-string it ourselves."
1,Broke upon taking it out of the box,"Please do not buy this. It comes in a cardboard box and broke immediately upon set up. I'm surprised Amazon is willing to sell this at all.It deserves no stars, but that's not an option."
1,Cheap and Flimsy,"I was immediately disappointed with this product as soon as i saw the tiny box it came in. That disappointment magnified when i opened it up to see some of the metal balls (which were tied to the swing poles by fishing line)dangling from one or no lines. After about 30 minutes of trying to put it back together, i gave up frustrated, and i just threw it away, seriously. Cheap, small, and a waste of money."
1,Total disappointment,"I ordered this for my sister's birthday. The shipping was OK, though it came in 3-4 days after the other product I ordered that had a 1-3 day processing policy. The cradle is comprised of a piece of plastic flimsy and thin enough that the supports bend inward, and the line holding the balls is fishing line. It arrived with the fishing line tangled, and we had to spend over a half an hour untangling it. After sitting for almost a week, the line is still crimped, and the balls bounce 2 or 3 times before losing momentum. I wish I could return it, but the shipping costs would probably not be worth the price of the cradle."
3,newton's cradle,"not very heavy duty..plastic that looks like metal..only the balls are solid...but it does work and is entertaining. Kind of small...I would recommend spending the money to get a bigger, more solid Newton's Cradle"
1,"Flimsy, does not work",My son wanted this for his tenth birthday. It does not work and is extremely flimsy. It is a waste of money.
3,Not quite what I was after...,"If you want a nice Newton's Cradle, this might not be the one you are after. The old adage of getting what you pay for is still true."
3,Baby Cradle...,Very small. :-( I recieved the cradle in time for Christmas and it's a great starter cradle for my 10 year old. Thanx
1,Cheap Cheap Cheap,"Where to start. Yes the price is low so of course it wont be high quality. I knew that going in. I assumed that maybe it wasn't as bad as everyone said. As far as the look from a distance, its cute. Small and looks cute. But it ends there. The balls do not bounce right. When they do go they last about 3 seconds. Then the rest start moving all over the place. I had a Newtons Cradle years ago. It was fairly cheap and was over all great. It at least did what it was suppose to do. Im planning on sending this back today. Im so sad and disappointed. Ive been waiting on this to come for over a week. Such a waist of time."
3,"great toy, limited design",this toy is a wonderful example of sir issac newton's law of motion and kenetic energy. keeps you entertained for hours and hours. i personally was unsatisfied with the design offered considering the wide variety of designs offered at other shopping websites.
3,newton's cradle review,Toy was fine. Niece liked it well enough. Nice little desk toy. I knew I could find it on Amazon.
1,Teeny Tiny,"My Bad... Guess I should have read the reviews... but was in a hurry to order and get it here for my son's birthday... Received today... it is MINISCULE! Haven't opened the box yet, but the box is about 3 inches tall! Now, reading the other reviews, I concur with all."
1,Not well constructed,"I've owned a couple of Newton's Cradles from other manufacturers and enjoyed them very much. I bought this one for my son and it has been very disappointing. The main problem seems to be that the balls are very light. Instead of producing a satisfying effect, swinging the balls produces a lot of clattering, no matter how carefully you start them swinging. Needless to say, this ruins the fun."
1,Not worth it,"I know that the size is in the description, but its really small. I know its my fault because it does say it, but the box it came in was pleasantly larger and then when you take all the wrapping off of it, it is small. Using after 5 times, the fishing line was kinked. I personally think it was a bit on the expensive side for such a small thing."
2,could be better,"Not made of the most quality materials and isn't super sturdy. A good toy for the office desk, but quality isn't great."
1,Not what it seemed,"The wires on this are bent and it does not work properly at all. I wasn't expecting high quality for the price, but if it functioned, that would have been nice."
1,Not what i expected!,I thought I was getting a great deal on the classic desktop toy. Instead I got a cheep replica. This is painted chrome colored plastic with fishing string.I truly wish i had read the reviews first.
2,These types of toys,"My son wanted a motion type toy for his room and they break very easily, Not happy with this item."
1,Terrible,i was led to believe that the product was larger - it was a very small product and very cheezy - Needless to say I am very disappointed!
2,Too small.,"The product was considerably smaller than any other Newton's Cradle I have seen (it is about 4"" tall, 4"" wide, and 3"" deep.) It demonstrates the principle, but its performance is disappointing. A Newton's Cradle should show the conservation of momentum and energy. However, this one is so small, and made with 'fishline' so the elasticity of the line allows the balls to begin swinging in unison--violating the very principle that it is supposed to be demonstrating. After about forty strikes, the balls are just swinging in harmony, as opposed to in opposition. Instead of showing that the energy of one ball is conserved by moving another ball, it merely shows that the energy is lost into the strings.The small size allows me to demonstrate the concept, but only as a visual reminder of how the viewer has probably seen this occur on a nicer product when they were in school. It is a valid reminder of what a ""Newton's Cradle"" is, even though it isn't a good one itself."
1,Appearances Are Deception,"I bought this because I've always liked Newton's Cradles, but never really got around to buying one... I figured this would be a decent one to put on my desk as a nice distraction while I'm working...However, this product is a waste of money. The lines used to connect the balls to the frame seem to be cheap fishing line... the frame is flimsy plastic that shakes easily... and as a result of the decidedly shoddy design, the momentum of the balls is lost in a matter of maybe 10 seconds.I would advise anybody in the market for a Newton's Cradle to look elsewhere and not even purchase one of these to try it out as it'd cost you roughly half or more of what you spend on it to have it shipped back for a refund."
1,Cheap!!!!!!!!!!,"This is a very, very, very cheap and filmsy toy!! It broke at the 2nd month!!!! A piece of crap..."
5,Good orange flavor,"Sharp orange flavor with a tolerable spearmint taste. I've tried many of the less expensive brands and haven't liked any other except this one and Good Seasons Tuscany. I'm not crazy about all of the Tazo drinks, but this one is nice. I love drinking this tea with chocolate. It comes in an orange package. You can also smell the other spices. Don't make the mistake I make, by adding too much water. As with many products, amazon is over charging."
5,kick ass kick ass,bob sapp rules. he rocks really hard with his fists oF FURY! YEAAH! bop sapp 4 life. kick more ass bob sapp you RULE! KEEP RULING WITH YOUR IRON WILL OF DEATH!!!!!!!!death 4 life!
4,The black duke 's prize,"Excellent book, I read all her books. Don't know how this one Slipppd by me. Everyone should read her books."
4,Another good one.,"Yeah! Good book, thanks Susan Enoch for blessing us with your passion and talent to write story's that I love to read. Dgv."
3,I'm ambivalent...,"Neither Nicholas nor Katherine were very likable. The plot and dialog were sadly predicable and lacks meaningful substance. Any number of times I just wanted to throttle Katherine and her ability to leap to conclusions. Wasn't enamored with Nicholas either. Expected him, as a man with a black 'reputation' to actually have one. Disappointing. I have a number of keepers from Ms. Enoch, this isn't one of them. Didn't love it, didn't hate it. Wanted it to be better."
2,Doesn't Anyone Proofread??,"*Note* This review is not of the work itself, but the quality of the Kindle book. I don't expect a ton from these books, but I do expect someone to proofread them. I am a third of the way through the book and am already totally exasperated by the constant errors and oversights. The Godmother Alison is mistakenly called ""Alice"" - by her own husband. Katherine has been spelled Catherine more than once. This is the heroine! Her name appears enough that there should not be a question of the preferred spelling. ""F""s have replaced ""R""s in words. Seriously? I mean, someone supposedly got paid to do this terrible, terrible job. Even if it was scanned in from the print version, there really needs to be some quality control on the product being produced. It's an old book, but if I were the author I'd be mortified to see these elementary mistakes being promoted as mine."
3,I reread this after many years but I wouldnt call Kate a prize,"I first read ""The Black Duke's Prize,"" many, many years ago when I first became a fan of S.E. and when I first became interested in romance novels. I remember vague things about the book but I remember really liking it so when I found out a kindle version was available and at a decent price, I jumped at the chance to read it again. Sadly, perhaps I shouldnt had revisted the book... Kate was so annoying and stubborn and did so many stupid things and made dumb assumptions that I really cant see why Nick fell for her. She truly didnt deserve him and i didnt understand why everyone liked her so much over the Duke! The book does have its moments though and had me laughing out loud, sighing and smiling and there are good secondary characters here to read about - especially Thomas. Overall, if you are a S.E. fan and havent read this, you should read it but if you arent familiar with her works, dont start with this one..."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this book because of good reviews, but I was very disappointed. Both of the main characters were totally immature and unlikable, and the plot was silly. Two separate and unrelated kidnappings was a little ridiculous, and neither villain had strong motives."
2,Nothing Special,"i ordered this after reading the reviews. I was disappointed when i received it. the copper bowl isn't very large and it is very lightweight. Doesn't appear to be sturdy at all. I had it ouside for a few days before mailing it back, deciding whether to keep it or not. it became discolored just from sitting outside! I found this same item for $30 less at the hardware store over the weekend but even for that price i wouldn't buy it. i sent it back and ordered the Fierenzy instead. hoping it will be a better product."
2,A little disappointed,"I was a little disappointed in the quality of this product and the fact that it had no grate or tools to handle hot wood or to remove the screen. Shortly after purchasing this, I saw comparable models at the local lumber yard that had all these things and were priced $20.00 less than this one. Also, the opening in the bottow which is suppose to drain rain water doesn't. Apparently the top surface of this is higher than the bottom so allows a certain amount of water to remain. The bowl has to be turned on it's side to drain."
4,Practical VoIP Security,I found that this book covers all the bases when it comes to the basics of VoIP Security. Provides a great foundation for anyone who needs to learn about VoIP fast.
1,Horrible,"Just as bad, if not worse, than the first album. You'd think they would have stopped after the first one, but apparently there's a lot of suckers out there who will buy anything just because it has Christian symbolism on it."
3,Detailed case studies,"This successor to The Natural Step for Business is essentially a set of four extended case studies, preceded and followed by statements of principles derived from The Natural Step framework and case study experience.Your reaction to it will depend on your appetite for case studies - mine is not great. The wider exposition of principles is mainly a restatement - and sometimes an elaboration - of principles that can be found elsewhere, including on the Internet sites of The Natural Step.Those who are working directly with the framework as consultants or part of an internal team will pick up useful ideas and tips. The general reader would do better to start with the authors' first book or with Karl-Henrik Robèrt's The Natural Step Story: Seeding A Quiet Revolution."
4,Good but different,"This album is pretty good, but don't buy it if you're looking for gang/street rap or throbbing bass-head beats. It's pretty intelligent dialect. It has some pretty neat background music throughout. I think they were going for a Method Man Medieval kind of sound. Pretty much all of the beats are pretty good though.These guys are definitely tallented lyricists. Just about every song is featuring another artist or two. If I had to describe the style, I'd have to say it was kind of a mix of 3rd Bass and A Tribe Called Quest (keeping in mind the mostly Medieval background beats, this is actually pretty good).My only complaint was that there are 27 tracks on this CD and several of them were about 1 minute or so, and there were several interludes around the same length which makes for several songs that were pretty good but very short."
3,The fascinating life of Sir Thomas Hanbury,"This is a fascinating tale in many ways, I enjoyed learning about the life of Sir Thomas Hanbury. People are rarely easily categorized, are they? It's evident that the author did a lot of reading and research. It's unfortunate that he is not a better writer, the book is worth reading but it is not an easy read. I also do not understand why the title is ""La Mortola"" when that is the name of the small village where the garden is located and the focus of the book is on the man and his garden (even though he did help the village in many ways). But don't let this put you off, if you have any interest in the Hanbury Botanical Garden in Italy, it is an interesting addition. And the garden is a must-see, it really is tremendous and worth every effort to get there and view its splendor. All those beautiful plants, shrubs and trees clinging to the rocky hillside and then the stunning view of the Mediterranean beyond that, you won't ever forget it."
1,"Stupid, ugly, and mean","If you want to look stupid, ugly, and mean, then buy these mittens made from the skins of killed rabbits. Despite what the fur industry would like you to believe, animals killed for fur are treated cruelly, whether trapped or farmed. These days anyone who chooses to wear killed animal fur looks either ignorant, self-centred, or both."
1,Great while it works,"When I received the Pinzon Penguin, I would have given it 5 stars for its design and ease of use. Unfortunately, we opened a couple of bottles of wine and then it jammed. Amazon replaced it for me quickly and with little hassle. The next one was great.... we opened probably a dozen bottles of wine before it jammed. We had been very careful and gentle with it, since the first one had jammed. After the second one broke, I gave up and bought one at Costco for $[...] that is superior in every way. Works as well or better, much sturdier, and has opened more bottles of wine than both the Penguins we owned combined."
2,As all other reviews - great WHILE IT WORKED,"I, and my wife, used this Pinzon Penguin wine open effortlessly for nearly two years and then, one day my wife tried to open a bottle of wine by Fetzer (who now exclusively use synthetic corks) and the Penguin was stopped dead with the cork still in the bottle and the Penguin still embedded halfway down the cork/bottle.I used all my strength to disengage the Penguin from the cork so that our wine was saved but, now the handle is stuck in the down position and I cannot, again, using all my strength, pull it back up to get at the screws to see what is wrong - it's now going in the TRASH.I see many other Amazon.com customers have had the exact same experience - I'm very disappointed because it was THE EASIEST wine opener we have EVER had... before it broke.I will not take a chance on another Pinzon Penguin and will be seeking alternatives."
2,Flimsy handle,"This device is an interesting, and works as advertised, while it survives.Synthetic or natural corks with a decent fit are easily removed, but tight corks require serious force. So much so, that the handle snapped off at the base. The rubber handle has only a narrow tang of steel down the middle, which stretched and finally shattered after only a few dozen pulls.Not worth buying when there are gadgets with much sturdier levers available."
4,Smooth operation at a great price,This thing works well and does not cost much. The foil cutter works quickly and the lever to pull the cork has plenty of leverage making the cork pull an effortless exercise. It is well built and will hopefully last longer than my previous wine opener.
4,Excellent!,"This is an excellent wine opener, offering great value for the price.Sure, we can all buy the 4$ wine opener from the local grocery, but, when it comes down to it- if you're drinking nice wine, you want a nice wine opener (if only for aesthetic purposes).This opener serves both needs- aesthetic and functional."
3,Overall as a kit very nice. Stylish design...but not as modern as it might seem,In general a good cork screw. A little to fancy for its own good.accessories might impress your friends...but..go with an electric version if you can find one....it's the 21st Century.
5,Easiest Wine Opener EVER!,"Love, love, love this wine bottle opener. It is so easy to use that you don't even realize it has pulled the cork - but it has! My friends always comment on how easy it is to use... So, guess what they are each getting for Christmas?"
5,Great bottle opener,Very easy to use and works great. Opened many bottles before with different gizmos. Definitely this is the best I ever use.
2,Lever broke,"I was very impressed at its ease of use- and then after just over a year of regular use, the lever handle broke. It is now quite useless, and I am very disappointed."
1,broken within a month of purchase,"this is a great product when it works. Unfortunately, within a month of purchase, this product did not work and could not be fixed with the extra part included.It may be a bad design. Too bad."
1,cheap garbage item... not worth a penny!! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS!,"This item is cheap garbage, not made well, does not work, DO NOT PURCHASE IT!!!It breaks fairly quickly...This item is HUGE, not worth to buy it...TERRIBLE!!!"
1,Don't Buy It,My wife likes Artesa Chardonnay. The cork is difficult to get started but once it breaks loose it comes out fine. This opener has major problems getting the cork to break loose. My wife can not open her wine. I can (with a LOT of effort) but I swear this piece of plastic is going to break!!!!!Just bought a Wine Enthusiast Electric Blue Push-Button Corkscrew for $29. It opens the Artesa just fine. The Pinzon Penguin is going away never to be seen again!!!
1,Quality It's Not,"After receiving the item I was able to take out the natural cork from a bottle; then it started. The machine would not release the latch so I could not remove the cork. After I pushed and pulled and pleaded to the gods, the latch released and I was finally able to take out the cork and drown the experience in a good bottle of pinot. With little memory of the recent experience, wine has a tendency to do that, I cheerily tried to open another bottle and the same process began-out with the cork in stays the latch. This time gorilla frustration took over and I was able to wrest the cork free while breaking the handle. Interesting to note that the handle center is metal while the outside is rubber. Needless to say I am not recommending this product unless of course you really want frustration in your life."
2,Works great for a few weeks...,"At first, I was impressed by the design and ease of function. I couldn't have been more pleased for two months. Then, the device jammed, the lever being locked in the closed position so that operation was impossible. There are no instructions or web site available to help. Actually, the Amazon description here is more complete than anything coming with the device. I would advise waiting until the revised model comes out at some future time."
4,Ok cork puller,"I have now opened two bottles of wine on two separate occasions. I got this cork puller because reviewers generally said that the cork puller worked well with synthetic corks. I was a tad leery because one reviewer had trouble with the cork puller. The first time I used it, I had trouble getting the cork screw inserted into the synthetic cork; the whole device seemed to want to tilt, which is what happened, if I understand correctly, when a previous reviewer had trouble. But it worked. The second time I grabbed the cork puller more toward the bottom. I don't know whether this is what made a difference, but the cork puller worked flawlessly. I'm guessing that if a person can get past the first experience, things will go well."
5,Well worth the price,This wine opener is every bit as easy to operate as advertised here. It is handsomely packaged and well-designed. The foil cutter and bottle seal make it an even more attractive product. I have seen similar wine openers sell for more than twice as much but they cannot be any easier to operate than the Pinzon.
1,"looked pretty, broke fast","I bought this because it claimed to work on synthetic corks and it looked stylish. It worked well for a relatively short time before it broke, with its corkscrew awry and one wing that fell off. The product seems flimsy when one handles it, and it proved flimsy within six to eight weeks after my purchasing it."
1,Be Carefull Who You Deal With!!!!!!!!,"I purchased these for gifts and one for personal use. Only one out of FOUR is still working. The lever BENDS and becomes useless. The company has a ten year guarantee on the product.TRY TO CONTACT THEM, THEY WILL NOT ANSWER YOUR CORESPONDENCE.So the guarantee means nothing for you, do not waste your money dealing with someone like this."
5,Easiest Yet,"We saw this type of opener used at a Sonoma winery. Bought it to replace a worn-out battery operated POS that never had enough torque. Once you get the hang of it, 'tis a beautiful thing."
2,Penguin not honoring their 10 year warranty,"I have a Penguin that broke and when I contacted the wholesaler, I was told the company is not honoring their 10 year warranty. My opener was only 2 years old when it broke. Good opener, lousy company."
2,do not buy,"I really loved this product but have since had to buy 2 since they both broke.. tried to repair the first one and could not now have another one, used for about a week and broken again.."
4,I actually give it 4.5 stars,Works great. Not perfect every time but pretty darn close. Sure beats others and is a good price.
3,Not as sturdy as rabbits,"The plastic construction is a little flimsy as compared to the rabbit type wine openers. No problems using it so far, but one must keep a good grip on this opener when moving the lever up or else you will tip over the bottle, and who wants to waste wine?"
5,Review of wine opener,I liked this so much that this was the 2nd one purchased. Delivery was immediate and shipping excellent.
4,A good book,This book has it right. A very good sample of the kinds of problems seen in a statics course. All the problems are worked out with written solutions. I found a copy at a local library. If this book was in print I would buy it.
2,The Last Rites Of Ransom Pride,"It just didn't ""trip my trigger"". I was actually falling asleep, so I might have missed the plot/story line. Action and acting was okay."
2,Do not Purchase,I bought this movie for my husband because he thought he would like it. This is not a good movie regardless of the actors and even my husband didn't like it. I am only glad that I didn't pay that much for this movie.
1,Weird characters + Lousy acting + Ridiculous and boring plot = The very bad film of Ransom Pride,"- The characters are very strange and implausibe. They make this movie like a fantasy mixed with western.- The acting is lousy.- The plot is ridiculous and boring. For example, there's a beautiful woman going around and shooting bad guys. Her acting is a bad joke.- The special effect is primitive.- The editing is below average. It makes the scenes look choppy.In short, this film is obviously a B movie. There's nothing worth watching here. It's a huge waste of money. It's one of the worst movie starring Kris Kristofferson."
1,"I'd rather watch an old episode of ""The Rifleman"" with CC","After 1/2 hour of this I gave up. It tries hard to be stylish, with a barely there story. Choppy editing, and just too many shots of sky, rocks, skulls...over and over. Move on, I say, pilgrim."
3,Bizarre...,"I bought this movie because I wanted to see some work that Cote de Pablo might have done outside of NCIS... This is a bizzare movie that won't be getting an Academy Award Nomination this year. It's OK, but not Great..."
2,"The Good, The Bad & The Ugly","The Good: There is not now, nor is there likely ever to be, a better champion for reason when the weapon of choice is the spoken word.The Bad: This book is far too short. There are several works (Some Mistakes of Moses, Secularism, come to mind) that are missing and that really is ""bad"" when most of this work addresses Ingersoll's thoughts on religion.The Ugly: GOOD GOD (PUN INTENDED) THIS BOOK IS OVERPRICED!!! This is a 99cent'er if ever I saw one. Really Mr. Page, you have done nothing here but cut and paste. This fact more than warrants the two stars. I would, on this fact alone, not recommend this book at all. You can get everything here for free & in Kindle format on the web."
5,ONE OF THE MOST INSPIRING BOOKS I HAVE READ!,"I HAVE BOUGHT SEVERAL OF THESE BOOKS, SEEMS LIKE EVERYTIME I HAVE LENT IT OUT, THEY HAVE TO HAVE IT!IT IS COMMON SENCE, RATIONAL, AND TO THE POINT! ONE OF THE MOST INSPIRING BOOKS I HAVE READ, SEVERAL TIMES!I HAVE GOT ALL THE BOOKS ON ROBERT! ONE OF THE MOST INPORTANT MEN IN OUR EARLY HISTORY, HIS LECTURES DREW MORE FOLLOWERS THAN THE CARDNIALS AND BISHOPS, THEY CLERGY WOULD COME TO QUESTION HIM, AND HIS REPLYS WOULD ALWAYS STUMP THEM!WELL WORTH READING"
3,Ho Hum,"Mr. Ingersoll may have captivated audiences in the 1800s, but I found this short, edited book to be less than convincing when it came to advocating agnosticism. Contemporary works such as ""The God Delusion"" by Richard Dawkins, ""God is Not Great"" by Christopher Hitchens, and ""The End of Faith"" by Sam Harris are much more entertaining and persuasive. The only thing I found valuable about Mr. Ingersoll's arguments is that agnostics and atheists are not a recent phenomena and they've been around challenging religious' views throughout our nation's history. Overall, it is a very brief read for anyone who is mildly curious about Mr. Ingersoll's viewpoints. But beyond that ho-hum."
1,A thoroughly boring book--you already know what it says.,"Judge Pressler is clearly the messiah in this ""Gospel"" of the fundamentalist takeover of the SBC. Pressler's preference for Marduk over Jesus is on clear display in this self-serving and self-righteous propaganda piece. He can't help but feast on his brilliant victories over the hapless moderates and liberals in the SBC--he goes so far as to suggest how he could have pulled off a victory for the moderates in the controversy!! This man is smart, he's just not good. Mean-spirited types who enjoy wallowing in conquest will enjoy this book, followers of Jesus will not."
1,Pressler Embarrasses Self & SBC,"Paul Pressler embarrasses himself in this disgraceful memoir. The story of his ""decision"" to turn down President Bush's offer of a government post is laughable in it's inaccuracy. This is just one example of Pressler's egomaniacal and self delusive re-interpretation of his own history. He exemplifies everything that non-Baptists falsely believe are typical of the Southern Baptist Convention, to it's shame."
1,spin city,"This is the book the Pharisees would have written about how they dealt with Jesus...talk about spin. Paul Pressler and Paige Patterson are the Annas and Caiphas of the twentieth century...they know scripture backwards and forwards, but they completely miss the message of love and grace and forgiveness preached by Jesus Himself."
4,Very interesting account from inside SBC Conservative victory.,Interesting account of events that changed the Baptist Convention for good and reduced the liberal descent that was in process.
2,Love Work Finding: The Life of Adrian Rogers,"This is an excellent book from the desk of Joyce Rogers, the wife of Adrian Rogers dealing with the integraty of her husband and pastor of Bellevue Baptist Church in Memphis Tn.. A must read for any christian man, husband, and church leader."
3,In perspective,"I was born 2 years after Mr. Morris. My childhood was not at all like Mr. Morris'. I recognized some of the events of the times, but the adventures he told of going through came across to me as gross exaggerations; just think of the 8 foot+ tall Indians he mentions. And the story about the race - very, very unlikely. His tales remind me somewhat of the character in the movie ""Bigfish"". Even thinking about Tom Sawyer, the incidents in there were not as outlandish as those in ""Good Old Boy"". To me this book was entertaining and well-written, but not really enlightening regarding growing up in the 40's. I watched baseball in those days, I went into a haunted house, I had my run-ins with a teacher's pet, etc. but I enjoyed Salinger's writing about this stuff much more."
1,Buyer beware,"I thought i was getting a set of lights not 1 light, there are other sites that do sell sets and for a few dollars less, did a iive chat with an amazon rep named Jamie, did nothing but insult and infuriate me, very disappointing experience with Amazon over all on this purchase"
4,Convert your grill,If you happen to get a NG grill and need a LP or vise versa just take the grill to your gas supplier and they will change the orifice. It is a 2 minute switch that most of them will not charge for if you buy enough gas from them.
1,Don't buy it,"I've had a Ducane grill for 15 years and was excited when I saw this deal for a stainless steel unit. After I ordered it I learned that Ducane had gone bankrupt, but thought it would probably be okay.Unfortunately, the ad clearly states propane, but they sent me a natural gas version. To make matters worse, the shipper cut open the box, so I can't easily ship it back. Amazon doesn't have a customer service number so I forced to converse via email and don't know when I'll hear back. Right now I'm out $500 and have a useless piece of stainless steel."
2,Not crazy about these,"I didn't really understand ""swedish swim goggles"" but I decided to order a pair based on the other reviews on Amazon. I didn't care for the flimsy nature of the goggles.. they didn't feel sturdy at all. I donated them to the local YMCA."
5,Thought-provoking,"This book clarifies much of Foucault was saying in History of Sexuality. Butler is careful, however, to not borrow the models Foucault uses, thereby, avoids some of the mistakes and gaps that occur in his thinking, namely the silence on women. Butler, more than Foucault, is not willing to settle the debate on sexuality merely as the obtaining and disseminating of pleasures and how those bodies perform them. Rather, she takes bodies as always already gender indeterminate and destablilizes their performatives further to show how bodies are marked by gender as well as race, class, sexulaity, etc. and how these categories are also destabilized within the perfomative. I highly recommend this book to feminist and queer theorists and well as anyone who is concerned about creating any sort of opposition to the reactionary right-wing forces that are attempting to further entrench their dominance over the rest of us."
1,A Diminishing Reputation . . .,"Martha Nussbaum is dead on about Butler, and if you want to read a public intellectual who is engaged in everything from gay rights to animal rights and to ethics and emotion go there. Butler is sterile and indecipherable in a fashion that is not helpful and prevents her from engaging the public. With her denial of sex and essence for women, she ""performs gender"" but leaves women vulnerable to violence. An overrated thinker who will be dismissed."
4,Pigs please!,"I really liked this book but I felt that the author downplayed the potential destructiveness of these ""small"" pigs. The pig must be housetrained and that doesn't only mean trained to go outside or in a litter box for his/her needs. They also must be trained to not destroy or eat inedibles in the house (including the house itself!). She only touches on this lightly and in addition she has the privilege of living on a farm where she can house her porkers in the barn. But this is my only objection. I very much enjoyed her stories of pig antics and personnalities and they have had an unexpected effect - I don't think I'll ever eat pork again!"
3,Good but flawed,"To me Kissin's emotion seems contrived, as if someone told him to ""play it again, this time with feeling!"". There is a naturalness lacking here - a naturalness found in abundance in Brendel's and Richter's versions."
4,Sturdy tips...waiting to see about durability!,"These are massive little buggers, much more substantial-feeling than those I've purchased at CVS. I like the fact that they're slightly taller than the CVS products (reaching higher up the cane shaft) and I appreciate the steel reinforcement. I'm hoping that that washer-like device will make these last a bit longer than the solid-rubber types, hence justifying the slightly-higher price.Bottom line: recommended!"
2,don't buy,wore out after 1 week of use. need to shop for different brand now. the rubber came off after 1 week of use.
3,sized correctly?,got these for a standard cane & was suppose to fit it by the size indicated.... did NOT & had to force it on & still didn't seat firmly.... grrrr!
2,Sub-standard,"I have used these tips frequently over the years, not because I like them, but because they seem to be the only ones available in the stores in my area. Carex used to make better ones some years ago but in the last few years have gone to this design. My biggest complaint is the way in which the concave bottom is designed: the edges of the tip bottom wear off within weeks in almost every instance. The tip is still usable but this is a poor design feature. Typically I find myself replacing these tips pretty often, and if I can find better on line I will not use them again."
4,Reasonable wear rate,"All cane tips will wear with use, and need to be frequently replaced. Since my stroke, I require a cane for balance whenever I walk, which I enjoy going for long walks to increase my stamina. These tips last about 3 months each in what I would consider very heavy usage outdoor usage, and 6 months indoor usage."
1,"Look Good, But Are NOT!","Carex Cane Tip 3/4, Black - They may appear to be what you need, but they do NOT fit properly!!! Design flaw??"
1,Useless,"I purchased these for an 82 year old friend. She fell, when the first tip disintegrated. I replaced the bad one with a new tip, which lasted 2 weeks before it also, disintegrated. So both tips wore out in less than a month, and caused an accident something they should be preventing. She now has the old original worn out tip, and does not trust me putting any more new ones on her cane. These would be good if you only use your cane inside, and only use it occassionally."
1,Dried and useless,"This product was received in a timely manner, packed satisfactorilly, however; both 3/4"" tips started to unravel within 2 weeks of replacing old tips. These obviously have been ""sitting around"" for quite some time and should have been disposed of by manufacture. I will not purchase from this company again!"
1,Wear Out Quickly,"For the last month, I've had to replace my cane tips at least once a week. I don't know whether a bad batch made it to my local store or whether Carex has down-graded its quality control. All I know is that I will never willingly buy anything from this company again.In fairness, I should add that I try to walk at least a mile a day. If you use your canes less, the complete lack of durability may not be an issue for you. If you use your cane or crutches more, stay away from this brand."
2,wear out quickly,"These tips wear out quickly. They give excellent grip for about two weeks, become worn, and need to be replaced about every month. They should last longer."
1,"Too soft, wore out in three weeks","The manufacturers ought to be ashamed of selling this inferior product, which has safety consequences for people who use canes. The original tip which came on my cane lasted for two years before wearing smooth. I installed this one from Carex, and unbelievably, it wore out in 3 weeks. The tread on the tip bottom is an outer ring, a gap, an inner ring, another gap, then a middle ""disc."" In 3 weeks of normal use, the outer ring detached and dangled from the tip. Anyone who uses a cane knows that there should be some tread, when one walks on smooth floors, especially if coming inside on a wet day. This is not even worth the $1.95 it cost."
5,Great book for English speakers,"I've went through many English Polish dictionaries and this is the most comprehensive one I've found to date. In most others I have trouble finding the Polish word to translate it back to English. This book seems more well thought out because I find all the words I am looking for, and have used this book for years. I am buying a second one so I can have it handy in the office as well!"
3,"Incomplete, missing basic words","I am brushing up on my Polish utilizing Rosetta Stone. Although Rosetta Stone is decent there are some confusing parts where they, for example, show a picture of a duck but the Polish word that they are using doesn't mean duck it means animal. When I am not sure of what the Polish word means I look it up in this dictionary. Imagine my surprise when I look up the Polish word for animal and it is not in the book! If you look up animal in the English section you will find the Polish translation but I am left guessing what the English word is and checking in the English section to see if I am right. Very frustrating to say the least. This happens with more words then I would like, thus the 3 star rating. I think this might be better for a Polish speaker trying to learn English than an English speaker trying to learn Polish."
2,Not for me.,I think this book is meant for a Polish speaking person to learn English. The pronunciation in the parenthesis (after each word) is in some sort of Polish language. It was very difficult to read the words using the pronunciation - upside downs e's and characters I've never seen before.
2,Misrepresented,"I read this book 50 years ago in my jr. High school library. It is a good book...however a bit geared toward juveniles. That should've been made clear. For $40 it was a huge rip-off. I would've gladly paid $15. I assumed, at that price, it was a greatly expanded version of the history of Civil War Horses. I will think twice before I order anything from that vendor again."
5,"A delightful, compelling, revealing tale of hardship and joy","I came across a used copy of The Bayman quite by accident at a flea market. I moved to the Barnegat Bay area 12 years ago and some of my friends are wives of bayman. I learned more about clammers from Merce Ridgway's book than in all the years I've been here. It's given me more of an appreciation for the very difficult work they do. My favorite chapter was about the ""Ice on the Bay"", but every single chapter held my attention. It was easy, delightful reading. Thank you, Merce!"
2,Too red - screws on hinges broke,The product is beautiful but more red than anticipated. The major flaw is the hinges and screws - inadaquate for pieces this heavy and the screws just broke when we opened it and picked it up. The 5 piece units are heavy and should have heavier hardward. When we wanted to send them back the cost was almost as much as the units themselves so the return policy was meaningless.
3,A glossy performance that never catches fire,"I have never been convinced that the pianist-turned-conductor Mikhail Pletnev was first rate. He belongs with Barenboim, Ashkenazy, and Rostropovich among great musicians who aren't to the manner born on the podium. Everything in this Cinderella is well executed, but the passion, wit, and sardonic point of the music is mostly missed. If only it didn't sound so glib. Ashkenzy is better on Decca, but we are still waiting for a cincerella performed as well as the best versions of Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet, his masterpiece in ballet form."
5,Prokofiev Cinderella complete ballet,The Penguin Guide to Classical CD's gives this its highest rating. This is fully justified
4,Great over-view of CLEP tests.,"I needed to take several CLEP tests and wanted the best overview of sample tests. This book met my needs. It covers the five general subjects as well as each individual CLEP test that is available. Each sample test is preceeded with an outline summary telling what percentage of what type of information is in each test. I used this information by comparing it to the Table of Contents in the book store to select appropriate text books.I now have six tests under my belt and feel safe to say that the sample test questions in this book are much more difficult than the real tests.I'd don't think I gained more than 2-3 points from each sample test. Instead, the sample tests gave me the mind-set for the real test as well as a self-confidence.If you are working on a series of CLEP tests I would highly recommend this book. Why not five-stars? Instead of a single 25-question sample test for each subject, 2 or 3 sample tests would have been much more beneficial."
4,Durable and Eligant,"A friend of ours lent us their outdoor fireplace and we liked it so much that we tried to find it online. After a little searching, we found it on Amazon. We ordered it immediately, and the delivery came in about a week. It was fairly easy to assemble, and was very durable. I like it better than others, because all sides have removable screens, so everyone can play with the fire. The ""only"" critisism I have for it is that the fire-grate is fairly low, so it's difficult to put paper under it to light. Also, it's best suited for short logs, as there is a bar that crosses either end that limits the size that can sit on the grate itself. Otherwise, it's a well designed, and well thoughtout product."
3,"Nice unit, damaged when recieved","I just recieved my Trentino fireplace. I recieved it in a pretty beat up cardboard box with lots of extra tape on it. This makes me believe it was opened before, or even returned before. When I opened it up screws and nuts fell from the box. Although they were all in there, they were just loose in the box. I thought, good everything will be alright. Well, the large base has a 2-3"" dent in it that caused the paint to chip away. I put it together to see what it looked like and decided it wasn't worth the hassel of returning it and waiting for another one. The fireplace functions well. Like another review said, the removable screens don't firmly attach to the fireplace. It looks nice sitting far out in our yard with some adirondack chairs around it so I'm happy with it. I am just not pleased with Charbroil's flimsy packaging and the fact that Amazon would send such a beat up box with loose parts in it. My first bad experience with Amazon."
4,Good fireplace,"We've used this about 6-8 times over the past couple of years. For sitting in front of a nice fire it works great. In hindsight, I probably should have picked a fireplace that has more of an open top design to make it easier to roast marshmallows or hotdogs over the fire. That's not really a knock against this fireplace though, just something I should have taken into consideration before I picked it."
1,The price is ridiculous!,I recently purchased this identical item from target for half the price. Anyone paying over $ 50.00 is being taken for a ride. Don't do it!!![...]
3,A FEW MORE IMPROVEMENTS AND IT WOULD BE NICE.,"Screened sides could be a bit finer to eliminate a few more sparks. Grate needs to be taller so you can put some starter paper under it befor loading in wood.I intend to mount wheels on mine, it's too hevy to lug around the back yard.It's OK, just not the best I've seen."
3,"Good fireplace. Bad packaging, Screens rust out.","I've had this fireplace for about 5 years. The height and volume are very good (much better than my other one). You really feel like you have a decent fire going.Parts bag exploded in shipping leaving me a few short. They were quick about sending replacements.After year 3 or so, each of the 4 screens had mosty disintegrated after quickly rusting (due to being very thin). Haven't really looked for replacements. This was in a total exposure to the elements environment. Probably should have bought a cover."
5,"An excellent outdoor fireplace, but packaging needs to be improved.","We've had this same fireplace for seven years and used it regularly for many wonderful evenings sitting around the fire. It can be used to make an enclosed, controlled roaring fire, or using just a few twigs and small logs makes for a short but pleasant fire. It has sat out in the weather uncovered (So. Calif. coast) and held up well, but finally it was time to replace it. We previously bought it locally but this time could not find it so ordered it from Amazon. It arrived quickly, but as so many others have stated, the box was banged up, had lots of added tape, and inside parts were dented, paint chipped, etc. So my rating is a 5 star for the product, but a 1 star for the packaging. I will be calling the company to let them know because it really is an excellent fireplace and just needs some protective padding in the box."
5,CharBroil Trentino,The fireplace was easy to assemble and we like the finish. It is as advertised. The perfect size for our space and burns nice because of the design. Our neighbors have a chimenea and are thinking about buying a Trentino because you can see the fire from all sides and it was easier to roast marshmallows.
5,Beautiful and fantastic read,"I read Rabbi Daniel Gordis' ""God Was Not in the Fire"" ten years ago when I was in the conversion process, and it resonates with me still. Gordis has a beautiful way of explaining so many things that I didn't understand. Primary of those confusing details of Judaism was the question of the importance of Torah. He made the study of Torah exciting to me, through his beautiful prose, and his logical sense. Now, nearly a decade later, I'm finally saying Thank You to Rabbi Gordis. He made a difference."
4,For a fan of the Music,"As a real David Bowie fan this CD was a treat to get this Christmas. I must say that all the tributes were well done and thought out and not just karaoke copies. If, however, you abhor anyone singing a David Bowie song but David Bowie himself, this CD is not for you, these bands are not David Bowie, nor do most sound anything like him. If you are like me and love the songs in nearly every construct, and also happen to like new rock, punk, what have you, then this is an album for you. Also the Dresden Dolls play a great Life on Mars, I'm a fan of theirs as well."
4,Let's Go Blues,"Good book about a hockey team in constant flux. Could have been a little more gritty, but the team probably didn't let the author follow them that much. Cool insight into an NHL team's season."
3,People change - and so does the book,"This book started in a very interesting way, but its after-taste reflects the typical Hollywood way: Literature got mixed with the LA emptiness. The first half of the book is very well written, with character and soul. The second half seemed to be written in a rush, in a mere analytical description of facts where the author lost his powerful insights. The style of the final chapters are sort of cautious and maybe too ""encrypted"".The book is certainly entertaining for people into movie stars' biographies (I am not one of those). It lacks personality for people that are looking for a refined portrait of an interesting lived life."
4,Mr. Byrne needs to write another Bio,"This is a good book if you'd like to know something about who Gabriel Byrne was a long time ago. It's not greatly detailed, but it hits on things that he thinks about and wants you to know about (meaning: he doesn't tell you about all of the skeletons/dirt in his closet). I can appreciate that he doesn't want to tell everyone about what was going on during this particular time in his life. If you know anything about his personal life you can figure it out.Whatever brought him to America, (Ellen Barkin when they met while filming ""Siesta"") thank goodness for that. He's a great actor, I think he has a career as a novelist if he wants one, and I love that he's back in the spotlight on ""In Treatment"".An updated, recent bio would probably be a fantastic read, so hopefully he'll do that someday.Tá sé fear álainn, agus is féidir teacht ar a bhealach go leor blessings."
3,It was a slow read.,"This just wasn't what I expected. I guess I expected an actual biography and this wasn't it. It's a much more literary piece. Very well written. I'm sure Gabriel Byrne could have been a very good Irish author if he wasn't an actor. Parts of this book were interesting, but most of it dragged. He's still a very interesting man."
3,"Nice, But Lacking","This is a very sweet book, written by a wonderful actor. Sadly, it lacks a few things. Details, for one. It's very good in some places, and then it seems to rush on when you want to know more. And it jumps around like ""Pride and Prejudice""...I had a hard time keeping track of where he was in his life.All in all, it's a nice story. However, if you read this and ""Angela's Ashes"" right tight together, you realize something. You realize that even though you thought at first that Gabriel had it kind of bad growing up, he is almost a spoiled little rich kid, compared to Frank McCourt. Let's see some real life, here!"
4,"Honest, funny and sometimes poignant.","When I first found this book,I already admired Gabriel Byrne as an actor so talented that he truly becomes the characters he plays (a rarity in Hollywood, now or at any time). I was amazed to find that he is equally talented as a writer. But greater than any of this, his honesty, sense of humor and appreciation of the people around him make a rare man, one that it would be a privilege and a joy to know. I hope he plans to write more."
2,not the best you can get,Bad quality blade comes off when applying to any high density material. Good overall build.
5,Best in a very limited field,"This is an excellent collection of articles on Soviet aviation in the 20th century. It was written before the wide-spread availability of material from the Russian military archives and so depends on articles in the Soviet/Russian Military History Journal, Soviet memoirs, and Soviet official histories. All of these sources have their problems. It would be interesting to see an updated work that incorporates the best of recent Russian scholarship, particularly that of Khazanov, Rastrenin, Zefirov, and the like. Until that time, this is the best it gets."
2,Must be missing something,"Am doing a bunch of problem solving, and looking for a better way. Bought this book, looking for some insights into how I could organize a team's efforts better.Not much there, IMO.Dean's method, in essence, is a structured form of the 5 why's, which allow a much more complexity than a typical 5 why's, but same concepts.Most interesting thing thing is the treatise on how different people interpret things differently; interesting but not so helpful.The only thing annoying in this book, as another reviewer said, is the blatant self promotion of Apollo's software / training.Overall, not a time waster to read through, but not something that will change your life, nor help you especially well."
3,"Apollo is great, but the book doesn't stand alone.","If you are looking to develop expertise in root cause analysis, I highly recommend taking a training course in the Apollo method. Apollo is oriented toward understanding all the causes surrounding an issue, and is at least an order of magnitude more complex than 5 Why's or other popularized root cause analysis methods. Apollo teachers have an almost religious belief in the methodology, and with good reason, it avoids the trap of helping you find the answer you assume you will find, and actually will lead you to understand that most problems have many causes, and one that is the most effective to fix.But I got that from the class. The book alone, when i read it before I took the class, wasn't an effective teacher.Great methodology, but not a great book."
2,Missing pages,First it is difficult to fully understand the concepts when at least 15 pages were blank (unprinted). Out of the 8 books ordered only one had all the pages. My requests to the seller to replace have gone unanswered. Also I was not aware that this is mainly a how to use the author's software for RCA. If you have Apollo then this might be for you (if it had all the pages).
2,"Unsafe act, unsafe condition","Repetitive concept based on all other root cause solutions are imperfect, but he doesnt convince me that his method works. I once learned that when undertaking an accident investigation to look for the combination of unsafe act and unsafe condition. Gano takes this to the extreme stating that causes should be expressed as an action and a condition. At first I thought he was on to something, then I kept waiting to read a convincing problem that was investigated by his method. I never seemed to find it. Nice try."
3,Applying A General Idea,"This is an application of the general concept that complex, tightly coupled enterprises are organized to have ""routine accidents"". To me, the two or three pages discussing ""punishment"" are worth the price of the book."
1,"This Fireplace really burns, even without propane","I recently received this outdoor gas fireplace as a gift. We decided to use this on our patio while entertaining friends. About a half hour or so into using this pit we all noticed the pit emitting thick black smoke. We turned off the gas and unplugged the propane quickly and the pit continued to burn. A hose was quickly dragged over to put out the fire-pit. My house was filled with the smoke. The bottom pan on the foreplace appeared to be the problem, burning a triangle shape into the pan. The pit was returned the next day and Char Broil was notified and sent pictures. In my opionion, this is a hazard and should be recalled but that ball is now in the hands of Char-Broil and the govt. Never again will a char broil product be bought in this household."
1,defective burner,"I didn't have a need to use the CharBroil Gas Log Outdoor Fireplace for a number of months after I purchased it. When I did try to use it, the flame was a yellow orange color, which put out a lot of black smoke. I called the manufacturer and only got the run around. They said the unit has a 90 warrarty, and since 90 days have passed, they won't do anything about it. Needless to say, I haven't used the unit. I will not purchase another one of their products."
5,Amazing.,"Perlman's Elgar shines with plenty of his famous nuances and wide variety of tone. Oh but the tone!... so warm and subtle on the middle strings, bright on the e-string, and heart-breakingly thick on the g-string. I don't think anyone violinist has ever produced such a tone, and it is inimitable. Perlman is the violinist of the 2nd half of this century, hands down.The Chausson is wonderfully mysterious."
4,Poetry of prose.,"Pig Notes is a collection of short prose pieces with subjects that range from poetry to diamond cutting. Heyen uses the form to work out some of his favorite concerns-- poetic necessity, unity, the modern poem, environmental issues, and life in Brockport, NY.My favorite essay was ""Poverty"". I liked the notion of words being used to order intuition. It seemed particularly appropriate to the book as a whole. I was less interested in the environmental writings-- while powerful, they seemed at odds with the unity of the rest of the book.Recommended for readers familiar with the poetry of Heyen or interested in this style of writing. Think Robert Bly and Wendell Berry if you are trying to get a sense of where to place his work.Disclaimer: Bill was a teacher of mine a long time ago, so I am not a completely unbiased reader. It was lovely to hear his diction again in these little pieces."
3,A Jewish spider?,"Well the spider is not Jewish but this book does talk about observing others rituals and traditions in a different culture, specifically Judaism. A cute book for a class. I used it for my 2 year old preschool class and they enjoyed it. It really inspired a discussion about shapes, specifically triangles and how to make the Star of David. You could do lots of fun Passover projects with this books theme."
5,Great for Jewish families with toddlers,"My child is 19+ months, so old enough to start to take part in the tradition of passover, ut not old enough to fully understand all of its concepts or parts to it. This book was a good introduction to the story and she loves the itsy bitsy spider! The pictures were abstract enough to invoke imagination in the story and the reading was simple enough to read without her getting bored. The songs for each of the sections made it enjoyable for the whole family. This book will be great for the next 3-4 years at least. Would buy again."
4,Beautiful Book,"Right off the bat ... or should I say web, the illustrations are really bright and colorful. It might have been too young for our 10 month old due to his inability to sit through stories that are longer than a few pages but my husband and I really enjoyed this book ourselves."
2,Of course you can't expect much for [price].,"What there is is well presented there just isn't enough to help you interpret a document for the Colonial period. Put the [money] toward a more comprehensive book, it will be better in the long run."
2,Good Book in Bad Condition,The content of the book itself is fantastic and extremely helpful. It's small size makes it easy to carry around as opposed to the average large hardcover textbook. The only downside to this purchase is that I'm extremely disappointed with the condition the book arrived in. It's not in new condition at all. The cover is filthy and covered in black marks. The lamination on the cover is significantly pealing off on the right hand corner and all of the edges are dented. The book is falling apart.
2,DependsToo Much on Protagonist's Occupation,I found this story dull. The author tracks his hero's way through a lot of leads and dead ends but none were very interesting. The minor characters at the protagonist's funeral parlor were supposed to provide color but they didn't do anything for me or add to the story. It seemed like the author thought well the quasi investigator is an undertaker so that's really unusual and I quit.
5,The Best!!,"I discovered Tim Cockey's Hitchcock Sewell series a few months ago and since then I've read 'em all. Like it's predecessors, MURDER IN THE HEARSE DEGREE is an ideal blend of action, character, humor and intrigue. A wonderful series that just keeps getting better!"
4,Very nice photos,I lived in Alaska for 16 years and enjoyed the book. Someone who has not been there will see how beautiful it is.
5,Very prompt,Wonderful book for my 5 year old nephew. My sister has to read it to him every night. Very witty!
5,Cute Book!,"This book has a very cute story. My 3 year old niece will love it! Her birthday is right before Halloween :)...Although, I thought the price was a little high for a short story paperback. But it was b/c of the added shipping costs (which are slightly over-priced-$4 dollars). But it was worth it. Because I looked at Borders and it was over $20 dollars compared to $8. So, thank you."
4,Received promptly,I purchased after reading reviews. My grandson is 14 months old and will probably like it more when he's a bit older.
4,Great Book for Preschoolers and up,"Got this book for my 19 month old, since she has great focus for long stories and loves animated pictures. After a few reads, she started pointing out all the colorful pictures. Will read to her every Halloween until she can't stand it anymore! Her cousins, 4 and 6 years old, LOVE this book! The 6-year old says they've read this book in her 1st-grade class and her classmates love it. If schools approve it for their curriculum, then it must be good!"
1,it's aiighht,"The movies wasn't what I expected. I thought it would be more raw, instead, it was full of talk and interviews. If you are looking for something like that, this is what you are looking for. If you are looking for raw footage, this is not for you."
1,It kinda sucked...,"....I somehow, watched the whole movie all the way through but after viewing it, in its entirety..I was somewhat dissappointed. They the viewer said earlier, I was expected more raw footage but what we got was interviews.Some of the interviews were interesting, some of the footage was interesting but some just aint gonna cut it in my opinion. I don't know why these people mislead us by saying stuff like ""Uncut, Uncensored, Raw..."" and knowing it's everything but that.I give it 1 star because I felt like I was mislead and I would like my money back..."
1,dont buy,"do not buy this float they will break after a few weeks. made very cheap, you can also purchase similar floar in local stores"
3,This is not a reference recording,"There have never been so many recordings of Webern's music in the market as now, and the string quartets are particularly well-represented. However, the present recording of the quartets and trios is very far from being the best one, especially concerning the early pieces (without opus-number) that sound rather unrehearsed and unexpressive. It is lamentable that just this recording was included in DG's ""Complete Webern"" box. Instead of this CD I recommend the recording with the Arditti Quartet (Disques Montaigne; this CD was released at least 3 times since 1991). The Schoenberg Quartet and the Leipzig Quartet have also released very good CDs but the choice of pieces is not quite the same. The recording with the Quarteto Italiano is unfortunately out of the catalogue since many years."
1,Don't buy your next grill from Amazon.com,I ordered a LP grill and received a NG grill. I have no NG connection anywhere close to my deck so I am faced with a complicated return or the additional cost of running NG to my deck. I don't even know what to ask Amazon to do to make this right...unbelievable!
1,Wrong Grill,This is a really nice grill however it was propane instead of NG.Anyone have a ng kit or want to swop components to make right.Please e-mail me at staitz@ameritech.net
1,Wrong Grill Received.... LP instead of Natural Gas grill,"The grill came about a week late. When it finally came, it was an LP grill instead of the natural gas grill that I ordered. Wouldn't it be a good idea to double and triple check an item that weighs 130 lbs before shipping it? After calling Amazon, they inform me that there is no replacement available and I'll have to set up a return by email. They didn't do anything to make the situation right. What a pain! Now it is way past the season to buy a grill and I need a new one."
1,Wrong item shipped twice,I ordered the Ducane 7100 natural gas grill and my first shipment I recieved a Weber dark blue Platinum charcoal grill. UPS picked up the Weber and Amazon reordered the Ducane 7100 natural gas grill. This time I received the LP (propane) model and when I called Amazon they did not really seem to care
1,Wrong Grill Shipped,We ordered this grill a couple weeks ago and it finally was delivered today and they shipped the wrong model (NG instead of LP) and now it shows as discontinued/out of stock. Hopefully they still have a NG one they can ship us. Even so it will be a pain to return the large package. We emailed Amazon.com because there was no phone number to call. We have now found other reviews on Amazon.com about wrong shipments/missing pieces and no reply from Amazon.com. We hope that is not the case with this too. If all else fails we can order the $80 kit for conversion from Ducane. (Who was very helpful and had a phone number to talk to a real person) $80 is a lot more to spend to fix an incorrect shipment. Hopefully we will hear back from Amazon.com soon with a resolution. Other than that the grill looks great and scheduling the delivery was not a big deal. Hopefully we get to use it soon.
2,Pages not even printed!,"I ordered this book and it seemed fine, but when I started my reading assignments I noticed that there were entire pages that had not been printed!"
3,Lost in translation....,"Although I really did enjoy the music and performance on thid DVD, it is definitely dated. Because of the sound quality and effects for this time period, this DVD lacks something for me. It was fun to watch, but like watching an old TV performance from the 60's, which is probably exactly what this is. However,you can't take away from the talents of Stephen Stills and they show in this performance."
3,"I guess the context of ""Live"" here means they weren't dead...",I agree with some of the other reviews that it was some what dated. This seems to be recorded in a studio not at a concert. I did enjoy the music but would have enjoyed it more if this was concert footage...
3,Looks like the re-release,"I looked up the German live recording which has long been available, and, in response to another poster's question, it looks like a re-release as the set list appears to be the same. Too bad as I would have enjoyed an additional performance from them."
5,Awesome Product,I can not say enough good things about this product. My 7 and 9 month old boxers are transformed into very nice walkers with this product.
5,I really am Mad About Italian Opera,"If you don't have any experience with opera, or if you have had opera experience and hated it, this is the CD for you. I had some experience with opera, but I rarely listened to it voluntarily, until I got this CD. It has the most famous and consequently most beautiful arias ever written for opera, and you get the benefit of listening to the most famous singers in the world, unlike other CDs you can get for this price. It is a wonderful investment, and can make even the most die hard opera opponents gain appreciation for the genre because of its caliber."
1,"Disappointing, too much for way too little","A lot of pictures, I'll give it that. This is the first book I've returned to Amazon, and I'm glad I did.A lot of pictures that appear to be from owners that post on viperclub.org, where you can learn more than this book offers.I think maybe if you don't have a clue and don't want to put the effort into the internet this would be just ok, or for a kid who wants pictures.Huge discovery, tells you what year has ABS, 2001 and on. What year had rt/10. What year had what color. I don't know, maybe I expected a decent read. One night with the pictures and I had all I could take. I paid for the return postage because it was my mistake ordering it and I consider that a cheap price for exit.By the way, it went down another dollar between ordering it and returning it, 2 weeks. Spend your money if you want but the net offers more data with very little effort and it is grouped for you on the viperalley.com and viperclub.org sites. Just my honest opinion."
5,Great Gift For Readers,"These bookmarks are absolutely terrific. I've purchased a couple with the angel charm and one with the heart charm all with a different colored stone. This time around I purchased the cross charm with the pink stone. I wasn't sure if they would be in gold or silver, but it turned out to be silver which made the color of the stone stand out more. I was very pleased with the bookmarks and couldn't believe how great they looked for the price you pay. They look better in hand than in the pictures shown. Makes a great gift for any reader or for a journal or diary."
4,First person POV strange at first but you get used to it,I bought this book becouse I LOVED the previous books when I opened the book and read the first few pages the pov was confusing but as I got into it I got used to it Walters witty coments added a great touch of humor this is one of the greatest books I have read in a long while
3,Short transitional tale for the series,"This book is a transition story setting up future events and the like. However, the story never seemed to have the same direction or energy of the other books."
3,Not up to standards,"I found myself dissappointed in this Guardians of the Flame novel. With the Heir Apparent and The Warrior lives I was drawn back in hard, but this novel really let me down.Point of view in the story has shifted to Walter Slovotsky, and he is a character that I have a hard time identifying with. He is arrogant, rude and insensitive. He cheats on his wife constantly, uses women like 'shake-n-bake' bags and has the gall to be hurt when she is unfaithful to him.The pace limps along for much of the book. Had Mr. Rosenburg spent as much time on plot as he did trying to impress us with his culinary knowledge it would have made for a much more interesting read. As it was everytime Walter began to eat I started skipping pages.Later installments in the series are better, but he would be better served by moving Jason back into the limelight. The Cullinane family makes for better characters."
4,Good Cheng info,"I really enjoyed this small book. It has quite a bit of info on Master Cheng man ching, whose form I have studied and taught for over 20 yrs. It is not for someone looking for instruction but if you want to know more about Cheng Man ching and the Master's background, this is a good source."
3,"Good Basics, But Lacking in Detail","The book has good general basics, but is lacking in some of the detail areas. I was hoping to debug an electrical problem with the right front headlight. The book had a very detailed drawing of how the speakers were hooked up, but no Chasis layout diagram, and nothing at all about any of the lights front or back. The book could have been more useful if it had been more complete."
1,Worthless:,"This book, as are many of Chilton's multi-year books, too general to be of use for any particular year's model. I was especially disappointed in the lack of detailed wiring information."
2,No help to me,"I was looking to purchase a manual for servicing a 1993 NX 2000. There is so little information in this book on the 93 NX, specifically the 2 litre, I don't know how they can claim that the book covers the vehicle. No one else apparently makes a book for this car, and I bought this book in hopes of having some sort of reference. I guess I'll have to buy the Mfg.s manual. The Sentra data appears to be as good as the Haynes, for what thats worth( not a big fan of Haynes manuals). The instructions are sometimes less detailed, but some of the pictures are better. This is a decent Sentra book, but do not buy it for a '93 NX"
2,"sometimes awful, sometimes barely adequate","Makes excellent firewood, even for the Sentra model, which it covers more than it covers other Nissan models. It is sometimes wrong, sometimes woefully inadequate, and once in a rare while sufficient."
3,Berry Plastic Corp 55 Gal trash bags,"although bags are very large, they are not strong enough to hold heavy items. They do work for me because most of the time I was using them for general household items to store."
4,OK for the price,"Given the price, these are acceptable.They are by no means heavy duty. I believe ""commercial"" in the description refers to the size, rather than the quality."
5,A Must Read,"A well written and thought provoking book by one of the great Marxists of the 20th century. Of special note is his criticism of the ""third world"" as just another form of nationalism used to block working class unity. A must read for all proletarians."
4,Fight all kinds of revisionism and opportunism!,"Hoxha, in a masterly manner, proves all the modern Marxist renegades (from Trotsky to Mao) wrong. Instead he advocates the sole scientific proletarian ideology; Marxism-Leninism. The fact that he speaks so badly about the same Mao who along with him opposed Chrustjev revisionism may seem strange. But fact is that Mao wasn't much better himself. Read the book and find out why."
1,Wait a couple years...,Wow.... The promotional literature for this product was great. I bought it and spent hours setting up my data and was all set to use it. Turns out it can't even perform the most basic functions of customer management - a mail merge or labels! There is a really cool feature that let's you e-mail directly from the database but turns out you can only e-mail one customer at a time. This may have been good for the stone ages but not for someone who needs to maximize time. Something as simple as a meeting confirmation to 10 people is very painful. I also spent 1 1/2 hours on the phone with support and a $75 charge for them to tell me that they don't support these features. Scary. Maybe by about version 5 they'll consult with real customer managers first.
1,STAY AWAY. They seem to have shipped without testing,"Yikes! I'm a lover of Intuit's other software, so was exceited to use this program. I've been using the product for about 4 days and have already run across 3 HUGE errors--the product experienced a write error to my database file and locked me out of the entire program! That's right, I tried to re-launch the program and it gave a cryptic Java error message and dumped out.Ok, so that's a hard issue. But they didn't even catch the small ones...try to delete more then one customer group at a time, and it only deletes the first one. The most basic of testing would have caught this...I'm a software developer, for whatever that's worth, so I know not to come down too hard to early on new products. But this one's insane. I'm going to try and get my money back."
2,Weak Cases,"Hi,I have used this book among others to get accepted to McKinsey (and with success) and I think this book gave me less then others.The advantages are the more or less detailed frameworks chapter and the real-life interviews chapter, but the cases themselves are rather superficial and sometimes even obviously ridiculous(like for example the case in which a Star-Trek like omnipotent people transporter has been invented, and the book claims that it wouldn't replace cars because it costs 100,000$. Come on, they would buy one for every block).I think there are much better resources than this.Good luck with your interviews!"
5,So Useful In Your Teenage Life,I have read this book yesterday. It helps me to understand more about my body. I mean in every part of our body. And that's not only that. It helps you to solve your problem in teenage life which is so useful in your life. These problems were sent to this book editor by teenager from all around the world.
3,Too soft of control when towing,I installed these on the front of my RAM 2500 used for towing a 5th wheel I was hoping for a little less jouncing when coming to a stop or going over wavy roads. There isn't much difference between these and my OEM shocks they replaced. I'll install Bilstein next time.
5,Bludgeoned to death with an icicle,"This is, along with the first, Boulez's most acclaimed Mahler and it's easy to see why.Boulez is as impassioned in this vision as Bernstein was in his (and admittedly, it's all too tempting to think of Bernstein and Boulez as the Apollonian & Dionysian cornerstones of Mahlerian interpretation) .No, the fate of hammer blows do not shake the floor from bowing woofers.Instead, the attack is launched with a shimmering, expressionistic icicle and by the time you come to the apocalyptic finale, you will find yourself enveloped in all the maddening colors of a haunted Franz Marc forest.In Boulez's hands, this is undoubtedly a milestone in crucial, 20th century works.Do not miss it."
4,wonderful collection,"I think this book is great....wonderful photos, interesting facts from ladies from the Victorian Era (which is a time in history, not a place or country) Great buy for fun women and history buffs!"
1,cute but not very good!,"I purchased this jar for my girlfriend because she buys honey in bulk and didn't have a place in the kitchen for that big bottle. The jar looks cute but doesn't work well! The stick handle goes thru the jar top from the bottom so there is no seal and air ges in and makes the honey one big hard glob. I do not recommend buying this jar, stick to the honey bear bottle!!"
5,Only buy HDMI cables on Amazon!!,"Anyone who pays more than a couple dollars for an HDMI cord obviously has no idea what they're doing. I have purchased tons of these from Amazon - they are dirt cheap and work just as well as any HDMI cable out there. Used for HD cable boxes, PS3, and Xbox360 and all performed perfectly."
5,HDMI to HDMI cable 6 ft (Cable Showcase),Pros: Works as advertised. Good picture and audio quality. Inexpensive.Cons: None.Overall Assessment: I'd buy it again
3,Qué lástima que no es grabación original de Sonia López,"Qué lástima que no es grabación original de Sonia López cantando con la Sonora Santanera. La música no es lo que escuchamos en el radio originalmente, sino grabaciones con un grupo desconocido que utiliza el órgano en lugar de trompetas. El título es engañoso: ""Sonia López, recordando sus éxitos con la Sonora Santaner..."" te hace pensar que la Sonora Santanera la acompaña pero no es así."
1,WHAT A RIP-OFF,"Great idea to collect the remixes from Alicia's first album onto one disc, along with a bunch of unplugged stuff, but this expensive CD has only 50 minutes of music on it! The real issue I have with that is that the two very hard to get house mixes--Roger's Release mix of ""Butterflyz"" and J-Jay & Chris Lum's mix of ""Troubles"", are both EDITS running less than 5 minutes, when the original versions are both about 9 minutes long! Why couldn't the record company give us the extra 5 minutes of each of those mixes and made this a 1 hour CD ????"
5,"A lovely, comforting book","There are times when we don't know what to say when someone has gone through a diffcult time. A Simple Gift of Comfort: Healing Words for Difficult Times is a beautiful gift of comfort and hope for the hurting. The words, the pictures, the complete package make this a book I will give and recommend for as long as it is in print."
1,Sunpack AA rechargeable batteries: Sun Down or Lights Out,"I recently had the misfortune to unknowingly purchase the sour cream of the crap, I mean crop! I bought one 4 pack of Sunpack NiMH AA 1.2V 2300mAh. The price was ageeable and I got what I paid for-junk!!!! My charger was acting up and I found out why. One of these brand new batteries was completely dead, would not take a charge and the other three after taking a full charge went dead as soon as I put them in my camera. I bought them from: networker-7@gmail.com in Ohio. They bugged me to give them a rating and when I rated them at one star they informed me they would not reimburse me or take the batteries back because I rated them so low, after they hounded me to rate them. I recommend to everyone: Do not buy Sunpack batteries, especially from networker-7@gmail.com. I also read many more complaints about both at amazon.com. CB"
3,$2 worth of crickets for $40,"The crickets taste like small, very crunchy air puffed potato chips, and there are about 8 in each packet. With 24 packs in the box, that's about 200 crickets in total. This is a novelty item, nothing more."
2,disappointing and overpriced,"This crickets are a terrible value, have no flavor, and come in very small portions. Despite the advertised three flavors, I found all of the crickets to have more of a texture than a flavor and couldn't really distinguish between the advertised flavors strongly. I bought these Crick-ettes as a novelty, and for that they have served their purpose, but judging by any other criteria, this product is terrible."
5,Seasoned Crickets,I get these every year for the students in my class to try. It goes along with a story we read. They are sixth graders and are leery at first but end up loving them.
3,is what it is,"saw this on a whim, along with some other low-budget horrors...this was definitly LOW budget, no real story but the acting was good...guy that plays the lead teenager (brendan Hunt) was good and the guy that plays his brother (Eric Johner) was really good...actually saw him in a play on Broadway with Gary Sinise, he was great in that. Film looks pretty good for such a low budget."
2,Too short,"I ride a 2006 V-rod VRSCA. I'm 5'-11"" tall with a normal torso to leg length ratio and this shield is too short. The wind hits me right in the forehead. By my estimate, it needs to be 3"" taller. When trying to decide the size of your shield you must take into account the rake angle that the shield will be mounted at. Memphis Shades stated the size of the shield as 19"" above the headlight, but that isn't actually true. The rake angle of the shield substantially reduces the height above the headlight. Unless, you are like 5'-8"" tall, get a bigger shield."
3,And...?,"Gom on Windy Mountain was ingenius, really ingenius, and I left it wishing for more. And it was by pure chance that one day I saw The Riddle and the Rune and picked it up. Instantly I realized and then and there checked it and the sequel, The Crystal Stair, out of the library. Both were absolutely fasinating, and after a long wait for the next book, finally I was confronted by The Starstone. Bleck! It started so slow, and so predictable; the ending was stupid and hardly and ending at all. It was the climax of the plot, hello! I now wonder where Chetwin's talent disappeared to. Rarely have I reviewed a book I didn't like and this is no exception. It was great. But the actual writing was poorly done and ruined the effect of it all for the most part. Sorry!"
5,High quality performance of Eine Kleine Nachtmusik,"This album contains Mozart's compositions Serenade in G: Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, Symphony No. 32 in G, and Serenade in D: Posthorn.Eine Kleine Nachtmusik is the most famous of the compositions included in this album. It is classical music at it's best. The first movement is the most remembered one. It sounds really aristocratic and upperclass. The second movement is slower and has more of a romantic feel. It is also famous. The third movement is neither happy nor sad. The fourth movement is happy and fast. Symphony No. 32 in G is really bold and is a prime example of a Mozart symphony."
3,More like a white paper....not enough text/material for a book.,"Misses the Gen 2 security topic.This book would not even have be 200 pages if large fonts were not used, it is good for a white paper. There is only one chapter in the book which I found interesting as it talked about RFIDdump. Final chapters are decdicated to Middleware application security realted to EPCglobal network, which I would be considered as general IT security and nothing specific to RFID."
5,Useful book,This book was used in a class on Servant Leadership. There is a lot of good information that is useful in developing Biblical Leadership.
5,adorable!,this is a beautiful bear - nice size - bought for a collector - arrived safely and on time --
2,VERY Unhappy with Shipping,"Just received this package and am very not happy with how it was received.When I ordered this item, I clearly indicated this was a gift. So I'm wondering why they put a Sticker on the outside of the packaging stating what the item is? Also it was packaged in a flimsy outer cardboard covering. I would not even call this a box. It had no support, was just barely taped as well. The tape was torn and you could see the contents and there is a HUGE BEND down the entire center of the item.I'm not even sure I want to give this to my son as a Christmas item anymore as it is damaged --plus the fact that the surprise factor for my son is gone with that sticker and the item being flimsily wrapped, he has obviously seen it. :("
3,Michael Thurmond's 6 week body makeover,"I was dissappointed due to the fact it is an old kit. When I opened the kit, it had casette tapes and VHS tapes for the program, for which I have neither. The product did explain, but it's my fault for not reading the whole review."
3,Satisfactory but not spectacular,"I bought this set after reading a number of positive reviews and the Best Buy recommendation from Consumer Reports. Overall the knives feel good to hold and cut with - I like the 8 inch chefs knife and the shears, but was somewhat disappointed with the 3.25 inch and 5 inch ones. The sharpening tool that comes with the set is quite useful (a couple of the knives needed sharpening right out of the box).I would recommend this set to someone who wants a basic set as a next step to stamped knives, but nothing more advanced.Quick update to my earlier review : We accidentally left a couple of unwashed knives in the sink overnight and they immediately developed rust spots. Fortunately, they have gone away after a few washes."
4,Good Value--Not the Lowest Price of the Season,"I purchased the 15 piece set several months ago for use at a shore house. I have been very pleased with them. This set is not at ""the lowest price of the season."" I saw them for t-w-e-n-t-y USA d-o-l-l-&-r-s several weeks ago. This does not affect the quality of the knives, but it is a deceptive claim. (Perhaps amazon.com has another interpretation of the meaning of the word ""season."") Another reviewer states he purchased them for even less. The knives are sharp and perform well. Quality is not as good as that on Wusthof and Henckels premium knives forged in Germany. The blades are thicker and the edges are not as evenly sharpened when compared to the best knives. Of course they cost only a fraction of the price of the premium knives. I found my set to have slightly better edges than the knives from a higher priced set from Calphalon. Overall these knives deserve Consumer Reports Best-Buy Rating."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"I bought these for my sister-in-law to hold her over until she saved up for a Wusthof set. Rating of a famous consumer review organization a couple of years ago convinced me to try these, and since the price was about $20, I considered it an experiment.The knives rusted the first time she washed them and left them out to air dry. How can stainless steel rust?Every knife in the set arrived completely dull.What a joke. These can't be the same knives that were rated so highly a couple of years ago. Anyway, buyer beware. Seems like these work for some people, and for others they rust.I gave 2 stars because the block is actually pretty nice."
3,DON'T BUY THIS IF--,"This dvd set is misleading. It says 10 episodes, but only 6 are The Andy Griffith Show. The other 4 are The Beverly Hillbillies. On The Andy Griffith Show the episodes are: ""Darlings Are Coming"", ""Great Filling Station Robbery"", ""Dogs, Dogs, Dogs"", ""Barney's First Car"", ""Aunt Bee"", and ""The Rivals"". These SAME 6 shows are already on previously released dvd's. On ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" dvd, the episodes are: ""Clampettes In Court"", ""Clampettes Go To Hollywood"", ""Elly's First Date"", and ""Jed Gets The Misery"". Personally, I will NEVER purchase another dvd from this company! The quality is NOT first rate! I already had The Andy Griffith Shows that are on this dvd, plus more!"
2,Incoherent!,"This book has many good qualities, good prose, clever turns of phrase, and reference to a lot of really good literature. It's a painful thing to read, though. The story moves along pretty well, then plods like an ox. It takes place in the present, the past, the future, and some weird places in between without a moment's warning, and I'd swear at times it's all four cases at once.I like Fry's humor, but this book just didn't do anything for me. I general I enjoy quirky stuff, this was just a mess."
5,Marrsy's review of Stephen Fry's the liar,"This is one of the best books i have ever read. Fry's outrageous sexual humour and clever wordplay often has you laughing out loud. One should not read this on a train, as you constantly find yourself giggling happily away at the most unutterable filth - the sexual nature of Fry's comedy, and his quick wit will appeal to anyone with half decent taste"
4,Great Beginning!,"This book captivated me right from the beginning. Stephen Fry uses language in the most beautiful way, and paints a spectacular picture of young Adrian Healey's life. I loved how he interplayed Adrian at Public School, and Adrian at Cambridge. ""The Liar"" starts out as a story about a person's feelings and identity, and is strongest when it sticks to those themes. Unfortunately, as others have mentioned, the spy story that is threaded throughout the novel is just a disruption. I feel that plots should strengthen authors' themes, and the plot of this book is actually detrimental to it. Also, I didn't feel that there was much of a resolution to Adrian's identity, suddenly everything is fine and dandy with him.I would however recommend this book to people. It is very entertaining and thought provoking, just don't expect too much with the ending."
3,Utterly impenetrable plot that is nonetheless hilarious,"Often hilarious reading, with some amazingly shockingly pithy observations on life in general that only an English public school old boy would dare to try and get away with. I suspect, however, that you need to be English to actually get what the hell is going on, plot-wise. The italicized bits were simply impenetrable, and I'm supposed to be rather clever and a bit of an anglophile. Still a recommended read for the sheer outrageousness of the humor. I'd be reading, and stop to howl out loud, and make a note to myself ""I MUST remember to steal that line!"" only to repeat the thought a few pages later till I finally gave up."
1,Kindle Version is Unreadable,"This is a review for the Kindle version of this book, and NOT the actual content.I am a huge Stephen Fry fan and I'm sure that The Liar is an excellent novel, but the typeface for the Kindle version is an absolutely unreadable, blurry, overcrowded, italic mess, and it is locked so the font size and face cannot be changed on the device.I got through two or three pages and quit out of frustration. I was given a refund for my purchase and told that it would be fixed in a few days, but it's been two weeks and still has not been.Save yourself $10 and a headache, and don't bother purchasing this book on Kindle until the typeface issue has been fixed by Amazon.I will gladly update/delete this review when it has."
3,Witty & silly,"Mr. Fry's love of the English language is very well displayed here: his word play is lively, his wit as well. His storytelling is a lot of fun, but the book ends rather limply as if he suddenly got a call from his publisher saying ""Dear boy, could I possibly have the book in by Thursday afternoon?"" and he had to scramble to finish it up. ""Damn! Now how did I get here? What was he doing then? Oh, bother! No one's gong to read the damn thing all the way through, anyway.""You want a carefully crafted resolution? Read Turgenyev."
3,a tangle of jewels,"I think it's pretty clear that Fry is the ""reincarnation"" of Oscar Wilde. Like much of Wilde's writing, this novel is gorgeous fun to read sentence by sentence; unfortunately, I couldn't keep track of the plot. I wish it had been a play -- or perhaps a graphic novel: If we could SEE who was who, and where, and doing what, rather than having to keep all that organized in our minds, _The Liar_ might be brilliant.The story turns on the lies we tell ourselves and others -- questions of identity and nature -- so if you've ever thought about the variety of narratives that could be made out of the raw materials of your life and choices, if you've wondered whether you're a hero or a villain or just a dupe, or indeed if you're just kinky for slightly absurdist tales of British academia (I know I am), you'll probably enjoy this book.(And if you found that last sentence too complicated, you probably won't.)"
4,Still funny,"Not much to add to the previous reviews; this is a flawed novel but it is bursting with all the jokes, one-liners and set-piece scenes you could ask for. I first read it ten years ago, and it always rewards a revisit. But for all you moaning American readers who can't bear its Englishness: do you only want to read books set in America? Is the writing really so impenetrable that the meaning is lost? Do we all have to move to New York before appreciating The Godfather? Or to nineteenth century Russia to read Tolstoy? I went to a state school in London in the 1980s, which is as far away from the 1970s country boarding school of the book as the Moon is from Mars. I still laughed at the jokes. Come on you guys - do yourselves a favour, broaden your minds."
3,"Pretty good, but...","The book in it's own right is pretty decent, although it had a few too many attempts at sounding hi-tech and that has dated rather badly. It's just that compared to the Count of Monte Cristo, it's barely an appetiser. Amusingly in the final notes by Fry he explains that he had never read The Count until after he has already written a portion of this book.Worth a read if you like Fry, and who doesn't?"
4,great insite in short stories,"This book is a great read it has lots of short stories on values, family, media and womens issues. It is very helpful in seeing other peoples views and getting there opinions"
5,Soul Stirring.,"I bought this recording because of the starry array of soloists combined with Abbado's conducting. I was not disappointed. I am familiar with this work only through the venerable Solti recording. Imagine my surprise at the wealth of orchestral detail revealed in this reading. One particular section so amazed me that I had to play it 3 or 4 more times to be sure I hadn't imagined it. At the very end of the 'Veni Creator' movement there is a series of upward vocal runs started by the soprano soloist and taken up by other voices. Beautifully executed and captured, truly breath-taking. I checked my other recording and was not to be able to hear this. This work is soul stirring, glorious, magnificent, and I recommend this version."
4,A good interpretation...but not the best,"This used to be my favorite recording of this work...until I heard Giuseppe Sinopoli's version with the Philharmonia Orchestra(also on Deutsche Gramophone). The final apotheosis is exhilarating but the interpretation and pacing of the work as a whole seems wanting in places; even a work this massive needs to sound cohesive, which doesn't in this case. In addition, the sound is not quite as clear as that given to Sinopoli. A good recording...but seek out others by Solti and Sinopoli for a better rendition."
5,One of the best,"There`s a general agreement among true mahlerians that this is one ofthe best 8th's in ages and in digital sound. This is a matter of miracleand really a very few recordings (Bertini, Bernstein and Gielen) can matchthis rendition. An absolute reference for this great symphony."
4,As big as it gets.,"Whenever Ilisten to Gustav Mahler's Symphonie No. 8, regardless of who is present in the great hall at the microphones, I think that Mahler just had to outdo every other symphonic composer in the history of music, starting with Beethoven's 9th Symphony. And here, we get a five star lineup of performers headlined by Anne Sofie von Otter, Bryn Terfel, Cheryl Studer, and director Claudio Abbado. Oddly, I almost think that this much star power is wasted in this setting, as the vocalist's solos tend to get lost in the oceanic instrumental backgrounds and Himilayean choral accompaniment.Even so, this is a really nice performance. My shorting it by one star is actually based on the fact that the accompanying piece, the final scene from 'Faust II' is one of the least interesting ways to round out the time on the two CDs. I would have much preferred seeing this talent being applied to 'Das Lied von der Erde' or 'Kindertotenlieder'. That would have made a star-studded performance."
4,As much as is possible in one book with such a broad subject,"The main problem with this book is that it tries to tie everything for over fourty years leading up to the New Deal together. It is very valuable in showing the links between progressivism and the New Deal throughout the conservatism of the twenties. A comparison of the German and American political and economic systems is also valuable as it gives the book an international perspective that is often sorely lacking in studies of American history. It would be impossible for him to make the book much longer but within its nearly 600 pages he cannot give the myriad of social movements the respect that they deserve. Overall, it can be a good springboard for furthur study or just a brief overview of this fascinating era."
2,Shoe,"The shoe fit fine, but lack comfort. The styling is plain and the shell is hard to the touch. After wearing Nike shoes for half my life, this shoe is far from comfort. I wouldn't buy another pair."
2,"Well-written, but its own glibness kills it","It's obvious that Duncan was greatly influenced by Tom Robbins. He quotes Robbins several times, but more than that, his writing possesses the same strengths and falls victim to the same weaknesses that Robbins' writing does. There is a remarkable and lyrical prose style here, and a precious sense of humor, but in the end, Duncan's wit and his clever epigrams push the story and the philosophy behind the story into a second place position. Duncan's explication of his philosophy is delivered in a cute anecdotal manner that makes it sound very pleasant but provides very little substance. The same can be said of the characters, who are amusing (I laughed aloud several times) but have little or no motivation for their development. It is all very pretty and fun, but it is certainly not one for the ages."
2,"Well Written, But Not My Cup of Tea","Duncan does a nice job of wording his thoughts in this book. I was forced to read this for an unwanted fishing class and the fishing thing gets annoying after awhile. If this had less fishing and more soul searching, I might have liked it more. I apologize to the sick cult that likes this book."
2,Horrible quality!,"Although I love the story ""The River Why,"" I was sorely disappointed in the quality of the recording. The cds would not play in my player. I had to burn them onto other cds, and even with that, one of the cds was impossible to listen to. Not sure what the deal was with that. Probably a sign that just reading the book is best..."
4,A Good Read When You're Asking Why,The River Why was the kind of book that I didn'tknow how much I would love until I finished it. I read this book durring a time of personal crisis (death in the family) and was amazed at how I empathized with the main character as he searched for meaning. Reminds me a lot of the way I felt after finishing Sidartha.
5,A Unexpectedly Brilliant Tale,"I bought this book for my husband because he likes to fish. I grew up along the banks of the Red River in Louisiana and enjoy fishing, too...so I was a bit curious about this little tome myself. Hubby and I decided to read this book aloud to each other every night before bed, taking turns with chapters. I have to tell you that I have never, ever laughed so hard in my entire life. Reading this book was a blast...a total blast! The story of how his parents met was worth the price of the book, not to mention the story of how his mother shot the dr's dog. Truth IS stranger than fiction. Mr. Duncan's family is one-of-a-kind and about as eccentric as they get in a very readable way. This book is in my 'I'd take with me if I were stranded on a desert island' collection. I highly recommend it."
5,Love it!,"I was a bit apprehensive when I found out I would be reading this book for my philosophy class.I just began reading the book, and I love it. It's quick and easy to read; many philosophical analogies."
5,one of the finest novels written,"Like others, I've read this book multiple times and endlessly recommend it. It's a book about fishing only on the surface and a book about our personal quest for love and meaning on many deeper levels. Incredibly written, touching, and funny--it's absolutely beautiful.Duncan's other novel, 'The Brothers K,' is TOTALLY different but an equally rewarding read."
5,Gus is one hip cat,"I loved this book. It mixes fishing in with philosophy, religion, mortality, love, and the evolving soul. I've read it 5 times in as many years and I've bought it for several people. David J. Duncan is an entertaining, enlightenting writer. Keep on fishin'."
5,The River Why,"This is a beautiful book. The transaction was flawless, the item well packaged, recieved in a timely manner and as described."
3,Cult book,"I can see where this book could be a cult liking. Author admits it was rejected multiple times until someone saw the merit in all this philosophy via fishing and scripture focus. For a free thinking, bright,liberal Christian maybe. Not worth the grind for me who wants a good story. The Afterword (last chapter), written twenty years later called Heartwork sums up Duncan's thinking about the messed up world and what not to do about it. Bascially the author writes we're all connected and the chakra to focus is the heart and scripture leading to God.A visual and more engaging alternative would be the documentary-film: Baraka."
5,I believe I will just read this book from now on.,"An excellent book about, as someone has already said, ""fishing, sort of."" A fishing guide commended it to me, and it is the best advice I ever received from him. I've really LOVED a lot of books in my time, but this one is in a league of its own. Superb. David James Duncan captures so much that I would like to think is ""right there but I can't articulate it"" that it kind of made me feel bad that I had to read this book to figure out a lot of stuff in my life. Anyway...heckuva book. Buy it, pass it on."
5,The River Why,"This is a wonderfully written, delightful book that will have you both laughing and crying. Though provoking journey of a young man's coming of age. Highly recommended read."
2,Bad Fit &Finish,"The plastic handles do not fit smoothly around the metal part. The metal extends around the plastic handles resulting in an uncomfortable grip.The price for a set of this quality should be around ..., about half the current price.The quality control of these items is, probably, not very good."
4,It is good product in this cost.,I bought three set (tow for my friends). They all like it. I think it is batter choice for those who need verity of knife with in a budget.
1,Not Farberware!!! Don't be fooled,"These were admittedly a great deal. You can buy only a few knives for the price of this set. But the moment you get them you understand why. First and foremost is the monster lie being propagated here: These are not Farberware knives N-O-T. They are made in China by the Hoan Corporation. I wrote Farberware about this. The knives do not indicate on them or anywhere on any packing that they are Farberware. What does this mean? It means that Amazon is putting that Farberware label on them to move the product. I find that so offensive it's enough to make me want to skip Amazon as a source for online products. The key to any purchase is trust and they've lost mine. So, how are the knives. They are what you would expect. They are full tang and a bit heavy with plastic handles. The block is a piece of pine crap that'll likely split in a few weeks on the countertop. Mine are going back post haste with an angry note about being lied to and deceived by Amazon."
3,Ok knives: use 'em and abuse 'em,"First off, these ARE NOT Farberware. I'm not sure why Amazon STILL lists them as that. The knives are quite dull; I was hoping I would be able to quickly chop with the chefs knife, like I see them do on TV, but the knife was way too dull and HEAVY! The sharpening steel is nice, but it doesn't sharpen them THAT much. I do like the variety of knives but haven't used half of them and have to admit I don't even know what half of them are for. That being said, I like the fact that I can use and abuse the knifes, as I got them for a great price on Amazon ($19.99.)Next time, I'll purchase a better quality, small set (don't need 21 knives!) but this works for me now. I am in college and didn't want a knife set I have to babysit, so this fits the bill."
2,Wet sleeve,"This book should have been wrapped differently as it arrived with a wet sleeve. It was stormy and mailbox had blown open. If it had been in plastic, this problem would have been avoided. It was a gift and I explained to the recipiant what had happened. <:-("
1,Waste of money,"If you like recipes that don't work, sauces that don't thicken, then this is the book for you. It's a collection of poorly written recipes that I would recommend you don't waste your money on.If you're serious about Asian cooking, don't waste your time or money with this book."
5,Easy and Flavorful,"I picked it up since I love Asian noodle dishes but have no Asian cookbooks and I haven't been disappointed yet. If you keep the staples around, it is so easy to pick up a few vegetable & protein items and throw together a tasty meal. I have made about 5 of the recipes so far and they've been delicious and satisfying, plus it's easy to improvise or make substutions based on availability of ingredients or preferences. The sauce:noodle ratio is perfect everytime. The recipes are economical and make nice leftovers! I also rate the book highly for design - it's very clean, modern, and easy to use, with close-up photos."
5,Great recipes & memories from an eloquent & superb cook,"Nina Simonds was hookeed on Chinese cooking long before it became popular in the U.S. Having completed classical French training, she left to live in Taiwan, learn Mandarin, and Chinese cooking at the source. She subsequently traveled throughout Mainland China, collecting recipes and converting them for Western cooks. Here she continues her tradition (from three previous books) of providing classical recipes with clear hints on how to make them perfectly and how to enjoy them as the Chinese would, whether as a snack or as part of a formal meal. She also provides sources for ingredients, substitutions and variations. Through it all, the writing style is clear and informal, as if Nina were standing by your side and guiding you along, while telling you how she first tasted this recipe. If you love noodles, alone or as a key part of a quick oriental dish, this is a great book to add to your library."
5,Moody Blues: Legend of a Band CD,"Absolutely no issues whatsoever. The CD arrived undamaged, the ""like new"" term was adequate with no scratches or scuffing on the disc itself. Thank you! A+++"
2,Just A Repackaged Best Of !,"I got this one just to complete my ""Best Of"" CD collections of the band & found this to be the same CD as the ""Greatest Hits"" with different cover art & exact track order! Anyone else seem to notice? Well, if your just collecting up odds & ends then get this one, but it is NO different then the greatest hits CD. All you'll be doing is be getting the same CD. Even the CD label is the same! They never even bothered to re-title the actual CD! which has ""Greatest Hits"" right on it!(unless mine is somekind of freak situation when the CD was packaged! I give it two stars due to the alternate versions of ""Question"" and ""Is'nt Life Strange. Other then that, a complete waste of time. I suggest the ""This Is The Moody Blues"",""Gold"" and ""Anthology"".Search ""Judemac Forever"" on msn."
5,Terrific service,Item arrived in quick order and played flawlessly. What more can I say! I was happy with the excellent service.
1,Not worth it...,"If you're expecting great performances from the name listed, don't...if you're expecting to witness the ""real"" spring break, don't. most of the dvd just shows girls in their bikini's dancing to reggae music. now i love reggae, but if i wanted to watch girls dancing around and every once in a while flash the camera (this dvd is censored by the way) then i would've rather bought a girls gone wild dvd. don't buy this for the live performances either, not worth it. get another live performance dvd."
5,"Please take me on an electronic adventure, too","One of a series of Science-Adventure Stories for boys! Endpapers have great map of the island/city. Science and mystery books for boys and teens! Wouldn't this be perfect for the IT or nerdy guy in your life?! Great deal, highly recommended vintage teen book."
4,satisfied,our garbage weekly pick up costs keep rising with a increase in the near future. With just my wife and I this amounts to just one bag per week which is ridiculous. With the Behrens burner we are able to completely burn that one bag saving us a 1000 foot trip out to the road for pickup especially in the winter.Jim B
3,Does its job.,"Pulled the burn can out the box. The misses didn't have faith of product for the price. Still burning in it, works great and fast burning. Leaves little smoke once its fully lit. Goes out fairly quickly after all is burned up. Rusted after 3rd burn. Probably won't hold up after a year or 2. Should have got a burn barrel, can burn more at once...."
2,small,"it is pretty small, maybe if i lived in a house with a lot smaller yard. i should have read the description better"
4,It works...,"It works great as a rubbish burner. The only problem I had with it is the second rubbish was burned in it, the shiny finish basically disappeared and reverted to a dull grey finish."
4,OK,"The can arrived dented. No big deal. After all it is a burn barrel. This would be pretty much useless as a composter. A full barrel of material (leaves, grass clippings, etc) would only result in an inch or two of fully composted material in the bottom of the barrel. Oh yea, the galvanizing looks nice. But, it burns off the first time it is used as a burn barrel."
4,BETTER THAN AN OPEN DRUM,"The design of this trash burner keeps ash and flames contained pretty well. Thanks to lots of ventilation holes it burns quite efficiently. Unfortunately, it has a pretty short life span. We burn a bag or two of trash a week, and it rusts out in about a year."
1,I didn't realise It was a disposable trash burner,"This thing is described as ""rust resistant' Hah! I bought it June 3, 2010 and it is already a heap of junk in my backyard. A total waste of money."
5,The ultimate trash minomiser!,"This product is great and is an excelent alternative to the landfill, or halling your paper or yard trash to recycling, so long as you don't mind the smell of burning rubbish, and your local municipality allows burning. The enclosed, pock marked design, promotes good circulation, allowing for a steady, and efficient burn, reducing most products to a fine ash, which is easily emptied in to a trash bag or vacumed. I highly recommend this product."
2,Incorrect description! It will rust left outdoors!,the description for the product explicitly says it won't rust but in fact it does left outdoors. Mine is turned into a big pumpkin (as in orange!) after few months.
5,Great Trash Burner,"The Behrens Trash Burner is an excellent product. Because of the strategically placed breathing holes, little residue is left after the burning process is completed. In addition, the safety cover makes this product very safe to use. This is by far the best trash burner I have ever owned!"
2,A bit more heart please.,"Even with the ""Double Trouble"" rhythm section on tap this guy still comes acrossas a pretty ordinary blues songwriter/player.I'm sure he is a nice enough chap but his style does not turn my dial."
5,From The Heart,"Possibly the best guitarist to come along in a long time.In the same vein as Stevie Ray Vaughan, but not at all an impersonator.He's got it all, and was sought out by SRV's rhythm section, to record an album and tour.That says enough in itself, but the songs, searing guitar, and his songwriting and vocals, are all you need to hear, to believe.This album was recorded before he was signed to Blind Pig Records."
3,Subpar for a wonderful singer,"Kathleen Battle ended her operatic career on a sour note when she was fired from the MET, and this album somehow reflects that--it lacks her usual vivacity and joy. This is the only recital I've heard form her that's routine, and things aren't helped by the fact that her voice, a light colorature, isn't substantial enough for many of these arias, which are for a lyric soprano. All i all, a disappointment."
3,"Good set, but I don't like the steak knives","I love the look of the one piece cutlery, the sharpener, and the good quality wooden block, but I am not psyched with the cutting ability of the steak knives. I've kept the ones from my older, cheaper set b/c they seem to cut things much better. Things like bread, tomatoes and steak just don't cut well with the knives included in this set."
3,Good bargain,With the exception of the sharpening steel this is a good set of knifes for the price. I was leery of the stainless handles being slippery or uncomfortable but they are just the opposite. The balance is also good. Will work nicely if only used from time to time.
5,Very compelling!,A great experimental exploration in filmmaking about the self-taught artists Ronald and Jessie Cooper. Very atmospheric and visually compelling. Leads the viewer into a low-fi world of heaven and hell as depicted by the Coopers. Very true to the coopers work and a great show of feeling in what must have been going on in the lives of the artists during pressing times. I am knowledgable of the work of the artists in this film but the film stands alone in its credibility and depth of the story it tells.
4,Bissell delivers,"Like her other book, IN THE FOREST OF HARM, I was hooked on the adventure and suspense. Some may find the book too violent, but when the heroine prevails, it's a ride worth taking!"
4,"Often imitated ""Dracula"" is still THE book about vampires","""Dracula"" is not a great novel, it is just a great story. Stoker's device of trying to let all of the characters tell their own story in the first person gets a bit trite after a while, but what is important here is that he sets the rules for what everybody knows about vampires. The first half of the book, while the Count entertains Jonathan Harker and first comes to London and preys upon Lucy and Mina, is the best part of the book. The final chase and staking of Dracula ends up being somewhat anticlimatic. Still, I think this book reads better than ""Frankenstein."" Oh, and I do know enough about science to recognize that someone drained of blood cannot receive a transfusion from everybody. A minor error given the times, but it still makes me smile. ""Dracula"" remains the standard by which Anne Rice and the rest who have followed in his footsteps are necessarily judged."
2,the bottom line,"I assign two stars--even though the research is thorough and the references are researched to the utmost--for an overarching reason that cannot be dismissed, no matter how we wish to wave our gaily bedecked flags and praise the book to the skies:Dracula (by Bram Stoker) is a dreadfully, pitifully boring book. It is an utter befuddlement (I almost wrote ""bedufflement,"" but it's one of those, too) that any modern reader can make it to page three without fainting away.And _that's_ the bottom line."
3,At least the baddies interesting,"The main prolem with this book is that Bram Stoker was not a very good writer. What he ""created"" here is the first popular version of a creature that had already been written about several times even in his time. Bram Stokers vampire, probably because it had the history of a real life monster, captured the publics imagination and this book only sells on the back of a culture that sprang from a great creation in a mediocre story.This will only interest those who enthuse about horror and, specifically vampires."
5,is this still bram stokers dracula? im confused.,"if this is just another publishers version of bram stokers dracula, it is still a deeply enthralling book (im just a mite bit confused). Well there ya go. If you're into intriguing mystery that'll get you hook you gotta check this out. I'm so good, I should write reviews for Amazon and get paid."
5,Pleased,"The book was in perfect condition. Came to my house quickly. Def. worth it...It was about 15 dollars cheaper than at my college bookstore!So, Thanks!"
2,The author has an ax to grind.,"I do not recommend this book for anybody who wants an unbiased account of history (especially of the Vietnam War). In the chapter on the Vietnam War the author displays incredible bias. His assessment relies on ad hominem attacks on the principles (only on the U.S. side though). He conveniently omits facts about Ho Chi Minh and the North Vietnamese. For all practical purposes, the author tells bald faced lies. I do not recommend this book to anybody who is interested in an historical account of war. All you will get is a plateful of this man's blatant bias, which is useless to the student."
4,A different side,This is a wonderful book for those looking for another side to the origins of war. The author tells fascinating accounts of the personalities behind decisions. He transcends the traditional explanations and portrays wars as the results of very human dynamics. Excellent stories and insights.
4,Great for Kids and Adults,"These work great and are very reliable (I have had one at my house for 4+ years as well as ordering this one for a friend). My only complaint would be that you can enter the numbers in any order instead of having to enter them in a specific order creating fewer possible combinations. For example, 3521 could be entered as 1235."
4,So Far So Good,"My grandson installed the new key box and so far it seems fine. Haven't tried yet to retrieve numbers of when people have entered the house when we weren't here. It is nice not having to give the family keys, they now can enter if they forgot their keys and need to get in when we are gone or should we be sick."
3,"okay, buyer be ware",heavy and durable. don't like the fact that only one combination can be programed and used at a time. (the housekeeper won't have a different combo unless you reprogram it every time she comes) you should be able to have one for every member of your family. don't buy it if you would like that option.
2,Better than hiding a key under a rock,"I was quite dissapointed with this product because I (incorrectly) assumed that it would take someone keying in the correct code, in the correct order, to open. That is not the case. For example, if your code is 1234, keying in 4321 would open it... as would 2341, etc. Order doesn't matter; all that's required are the correct numbers being punched down. Better than hiding a key under a doormat, but not quite the same security I thought I was getting."
2,RobW,"After several years of use a changed combination would not work -- the combo was tested twice before reinstalling. At that time I discovered that a large heavy object, a rock for example, hit on the open button would release the key. I do not know if this would work on a new unit, but would not feel secure with the same unit."
4,GE AccessPoint Digital KeySafe,"This is a very rugged and well built key safe. Easy to program, install, looks nice and has a digital clock. Only one negative point, the access code can be entered in any order to unlock the KeySafe. Not a big deal and much safer than hiding your key under the rug or a rock."
1,Ge,"After I installed the key box on the wall I had to take it down to adjust the time for daylight savings time. When reattatching it to the wall the pin on the mounting bracket fell off. I tried to contact customer service for GE but the never got back to me. GE customer service is terrible, I guess they don't stand behind their products."
3,Review of The Lure of Hollywood,"The Lure of Hollywood (aka The Reckless Way) stars Marion Nixon, Kane Richmond, Inez Courtney, Malcolm McGregor, Harry Harvey, Art Howard, Gloria Gordon, William Strauss and John Peters. In the story Helen Rogers (Nixon) is a hotel stenographer who aspires to be an actress. Jim Morgan (Richmond), the hotel clerk, wants her to marry him, but in deference to her desires sets her up to meet with the producer/owner of Apex Films with whom she signs a contract. Meanwhile the other man interested in her, Don Reynolds (McGregor) tries to ruin her chances for stardom by attempting to foil her debut film. The scene is then set for a struggle between Morgan and Reynolds for the heart of Helen Rogers.The quality of this recording is so-so, but it is definitely watchable for its 68 minutes of run time. The acting varies, with Richmond and Nixon, and especially Inez Courtney doing well, while some of the others look rather wooden."
1,"OK film, terrible video quality","Don't have to say much. This film is an okay early indie about the goings-on in the Hollywood movie industry, but the Alpha Video quality is far from perfect. Too bad. A mid-grade early talkie like this just really goes down the tube when the quality is so bad."
2,A Post Modern Mess,"At first Constitutional Fate looks much like a typical anthology of the most significant modes of constitutinal argument, for this I must admit the book does a fairly good job. The problem comes at the end; where we must endure an unconnected attempt to give the book purpose. The authors argument is essentially that there is no argument.Now I must admit I am reading this for a take home final so perhaps I am just a little jaded. For one minuete I think that there is nothing but brilliance in these last few pages; only for seconds later to conclude that it is all just a bunch of smoke."
4,Static vs Dynamic,"If one wants to understand the Marxian application of the dialectic, look no further. Within the book is a through explanation of the philosophy of internal relationships and the process of abstraction. They are the linchpins for correct dialectical thinking from a Marxian perspective, and most probably from any dialectical prespective.I personally do not agree with the application of the dialectic for I do not fully accept the process of change the dialectic demands in order to achieve its goals. But if one does not understand the dialectic, you are not alone, but this book will go a long to way to help explain it. Another useful book is ""Total Freedom"" by Chris Sciabarra. In that book, the author has a slightly different take and application of the dialectic, but the two will paint a very large picture of the dialectic."
3,"Nice graphics, BAD music","The graphics are top notch, but the music is terrible. It feels like you're watching MTV or VH1, hip-hop, rap, rock. Do you really want to TRAIN your kids to be mindless, 24-hour-a-day MTV junkies AT THIS EARLY AGE? They will learn to like this type of music from their friends later, when they are ready. Why force it upon them now? Jumpstart could have provided more age appropriate music that is just as engaging, but they didn't. Just like many parents, they want to force kids to grow up too quickly."
1,Requires Quicktime,"Wish I had looked more closely at the product specs. The PC version requires Quicktime 5 installation which, in turn, requires web access (control). There was no getting past the last installation screen that requires ALL of Quicktime or none at all. I don't want or need more bloat on my computer. I've had no end of conflicts and trouble with Quicktime in the past and not willing to risk it now."
1,system requirements,"We bought the game before the new computer, and it will not load. This was a big dissapointment for our little one because he wanted to play games."
5,Wonderful learning game,I absolutely love this game. My daughter knows a lot about animals and their habitats because of this interactive game. I've yet to find something else as well put together as this!
4,Lots of entertainment,My kids love this one. They learn about the great variety of the natural world in an entertaining way. My main problem with the JumpStart CDs is that you have to use the disc to run them rather than copying it onto the computer. With children being children this usually leads to scratched and damaged discs. I've deducted 1 star for this.
2,Very poor packaging causing damage to an expensive book.,"The $90 book was shipped in an envelope it was squeezed into without any protective packaging. It got banged up in the mail and a top corner of the spine was torn and there were scuffs on the bottom of the spine. For an expensive book, it deserved more substantial packaging and respect."
2,Borrow it from the library!,"Great Pictures, Boring Text. Each chapter is a rewording of the last one. The pictures however are very good. If you got it free from your publishers - lucky you, but dont bother to buy it, borrow it from the library. Read it if you have sleep problems, they'll be solved overnight!!"
5,Great,I bough this as a required reading for a religion class I was taking and it was an amazing read. It keeps you interested the entire time.
1,Unbarable FM AM AUX Radio and it's always Wednesday,"i should have read the review from the other post earlier. the radio is really really bad. i got nothing but noise. also, no matter you set to april 8,2007 or october 20, 2006, the day also show wednesday. quality is ok, not great. i would suggest you not to buy. or try it out in store first. btw, the button is hard to push down as well."
4,Excellent iPod Alarm Clock,"As an iPod alarm clock, the Luna is great. The only thing missing is the ability to wake to a certain playlist, though I don't know of ANY iPod alarm clock that has that capability.Pros:-Adjustable dimmer from completely black to blinding.-Inverted white-on-black display is easier on the eyes-Design is top notch-Scroll wheels offer a good way to navigate the menu system-Presets for radio stations-Two completely separate alarms with customizable alarm sources (iPod, Radio, Buzzer)-Audio fade in/out for alarms/sleep.Cons:-FM antenna is weak (I attached mine backwards with the loop around the pin just to get it to sound decent).-Scroll wheels are sometimes slow to respond/not-precise-Minimum audio level for alarm is 5, which can be a bit loud for the iPod.Overall, I am very happy with this iPod alarm clock. After researching all the options at the time (Dec. 2006), it had the best design, best feature set, and best fit for my expectations for the money."
1,"First unit failed, awaiting replacement","Update: I finally heard back from Xtreme Mac and they are making it right! I can't wait to get my hands on this unit. I know it looked amazing at Macworld last year.I purchased the Luna back in July and planed to give it to my wife for Christmas. Well, Christmas came and I finally gave her this nice gift. Unfortunately, the unit turns on but doesn't play any music from any ipod or any radio station. I called Xtreme Mac for help and they said they'd call me back. No call back. I called them again and finally got a hold of somebody. He said that the Luna only has a 90-day warranty and since the warranty was up he couldn't do anything for me. Technically, he's right, but as far as taking care of a customer he's wrong."
4,XtremeMac (PD-LUN-00) Luna Alarm Clock Audio System,"I am very happy with this product. We were looking for a good FM radio in our location in which there is much interference from other stations, that was easy to use with an ipod and as a clock-radio. The external antennae worked fine to provide much better reception than other radios such as an older ihome system we had. Controls are large and easy to use, the ability to control the brightness of display at night is a big plus. Still the display is not as large as some other radios so it is difficult for my wife to read the time without her glasses. And like so many products today the lack of a printed user manual was an irritation. We downloaded a manual and found everything pretty easy to get going after a bit of reading. Sound quality is good, and overall design is a nice alternative to other models I have seen. I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting a clock radio with a nice audio system for a reasonable price."
4,Pretty good,"I love the unit, BUT, I am already having a slight problem.The button I press for ""snooze"" doesn't always work. SometimesI have to press it 2 or 3 times to work.Otherwise, a fantastic unit.Good sound and great looks. Well designed."
2,"Great Features, BUT sub-standard FM Reception","I read reviews and bought unit locally (older version 2.11). As stated by other posters, the FM reception is HORRIBLE. There is an extreme amount of interference and static. Place the antenna straight up and away from unit helps. I suspect the FM receiver is poor design with bad filtering and is picking up electrical noise from unit itself. If you want an FM receiver, I suggest you avoid this unit. Another website claims problem fixed in units built around/after April '07. Since I wanted FM receiver I didn't test product any further. Very disappointing given price and all the other obvious quality engineering that went into product. For the money, I would have easily picked this one over iHome 5/6/8 or iLive 3607 or others I investigated."
4,Xtremely Happy,Best alarm clock i've ever owned. It ramps up the music to slowly wake you up. Easy to use and good sound.
4,Great alarm and much more,"This is a great little alarm clock/bedroom stereo. The sound quality is suberb for its size , it looks quite sleek, and is very easy to use. My only criticism would be that the unit seems a bit slow to respond to input from the buttons and knobs. Nothing to keep me from enjoying it though."
1,Wrong Version,"I just ordered 4 of the Luna ipod clock radios. Each one had the firmware version 2.02. The order was placed on September 29, 2007. I immediately notified Amazon that I was furious and have scheduled UPS to come pick them back up. Called Amazon and asked if they could send version 2.12U. They replied, ""Sorry can't help you.""If you want this product, don't buy from these guys."
4,good fish oil,Nordic natural you get your monies worth with this fish oil.......Just look at the Epa and Dha numbers....enough said.....The market is flooded with a lot of cheap fish oil pills....
3,A predictable Harlequin romance (HQN).,"This is story of Serena who is dermatologist who becomes involved in stealing a famous painting to prove her neighbor maybe a prince. The story was very predictable and over all an Ok Harlequin romance (HQN). If you looking for a new romance book I would look at I would suggest any books from Ellen Byerrum, Kate Angell , Janet Evanovich and Jennifer Cruise."
4,"Realistic? Maybe, but entertaining, too","I loved that this was set in 1986 Brooklyn, so evocative of a time lost. Jeff Daniels is pitch perfect as the PhD dad who is at war with his emotions. The two kids give rather astonishing performances, squirm-worthy, really. There's no plot, but the writing is the real star here, and it shines. Highly recommended."
3,"Like a train wreck, it's hard to stop watching...","Arrogant, self-centered, and generally unpleasant people raising their kids to be the same way. Jeff Daniels plays one of the most unlikeable, unsympathetic characters I've ever seen, and Laura Linney is only slightly less unlovable as his estranged wife. Still, like a train wreck, it's hard to stop watching. Unfortunately, there are a few too many squirm and/or cringe-inducing scenes. On the plus side, it's fun watching the youngest son swear and drink beer, there's a cool soundtrack, and the movie is mercifully short.Grade: CSafest bet: Get the soundtrack, skip the movie..."
2,The 5000th growing-up-in-Brooklyn movie!,"If you are, say, over 30 years old, you have already seen this picture about dysfunctional families from Booklyn (or New York, or the Bronx), everyone endlessly shouting at each other over some stupid issue or other -- with other actors, other clothes, other beds, perhaps -- but still the same old stale ""plot,"" and no improvement on the variations.If you are over 30, do yourself a favor. You have probably already exceeded your lifetime required quota of 50 repeats, and you can feel free to pass on this movie. I was taken in by the ads, so you've been warned.I have given the picture a 2-star rating because of the one player who kept my attention -- a beautiful big fluffy cat who would occasionally make an appearance, and then quietly slink away in dismay."
2,A squid plus a whale equals a turkey,"This is one of the more highly-overrated independent flicks to come out in years; actually, at 82 minutes, perhaps it's best described as a short film.All four of the main characters are deeply, deeply flawed, without redemption. Jeff Daniels in particular plays one of the biggest on-screen a-holes in the history of film. So here's my question -- why should we care about him? Why should we care about what happens to this family?And the metaphor to the squid and the whale? Jesus, can you beat that into our heads one more time, please? You know, in case we didn't get it the first four times you bring it up?????By the way, for a movie set in 1986, I sure saw a lot of SUV's tooling around.An unpleasant movie experience on many levels."
2,So realistic it's uncomfortable,This is the sad story of a divorce and it's aftermath. Jeff Daniels plays another jerk who turns his sons against their mother while seducing one of his female college students. He's the stereotypical egomaniac former successful writer who turns ruthless and hostile after his wife also becomes a successful writer. He can't handle the competition and it turns his madonna/whore complex on high gear. He even fights over custody of the family pet!If your parents are divorced this may bring back some painful repressed memories. Sadly it's the story of my generation. People with kids should watch this before divorcing. The worst part is the confustion of the boys and the distortion of the facts by their father.
1,Horrible People!,"I bought this movie based on the trailer which made it look like a hilarious family comedy. I was quite surprised, unplesasantly so, when I watched it and found it to be a dark, morose and depressing story. While staffed by a talented cast, the characters they portrayed were in a word...horrible! Mean, spiteful, selfish and totally self involved. This was akin to watching the losers that populate reality TV at their very worst. I actually gave this movie to a friend as a birthday gift, again based on the trailer and before I watched my own copy, and I called him afterward to apologize for giving him such a poor movie. Save your money, this one is a good example of a movie that should never have been made. Horrible!"
3,This is a comedy??,"I can't imagine why the producers called this sad movie a comedy. It's about as funny as a fatal illness. This family is four desperately unhappy people, especially the father and two sons. It's very dark and depressing. And be forewarned, it definitely earned its R rating. Even the 11-year-old uses the F-word, and often. And his sexually weird behavior make this SO not a comedy."
2,SquidWhale,"The Squid and the Whale is a short, quick, handsomely made and extremely well-acted, yet completely deplorable film. It is a near-pointless vision of truly despicable and soulless intellectuals and there's barely anyone in the movie that one can even stand to watch. The youngest child would be the one to root for, except he's busy wiping semen on everything. I have no problem with movies regarding fueding liberal families. But these people are just disturbed and cold and heartless. I was pleased that it was only 81 minutes long, and you will be too. I will repeat that it's really a very seriously well-made film. I think the critics loved it so much because besides the quality acting and cinematography, they can relate to the silly lifestyles of these out-of-touch New Yorkers. Avoid."
4,Jeff Daniels is brilliant.,"I saw THE SQUID AND THE WHALE, which stars Jeff Daniels and Laura Linney, earlier this week at the Tara, and it was a very good movie about two writers who get divorced in the 1980s and the odd impact it has on their two sons. Daniels is brilliant in the movie as an arrogant author past his glory days who, when his marriage ends, sees himself as the victim in the situation and declares a passive-agressive war on his ex-wife. Linney, as usual, is good. Though the movie didn't completely bowl me over, it contains strong performances and good writing. I recommend it."
2,The far fetched and the whale,"I sure see the overratings piling up here... And I know I'm a dead woman now - but! - it didn't make an impression on me. It is shallow. It is as predictable as a L M Montgomery novel. It's painfully cliché-ridden and it's too obvious. The younger son smearing semen on the lockers is odd, but not odd in a good way. It's just very forced.The ""Rosebud""-like mantra of the elder son - ""The squid and the whale""-memory - feels like a cliché.But the cast is phenomenal. Of course. Doesn't help a weak story though. Sorry!"
4,An Honest Portrayal,The Squid and the Whale gives an honest portrayal of a long-term marriage falling apart and subsequently ending in divorce. The movie highlights the differences the divorce impact has on the older child versus the younger child as well as the parents' relationship. The divorce happens at a critical time in both childrens' lives when their self-identities and sexuality are changing and/or being discovered. You can imagine that having your seemingly happy home turned upside down during these major life changes can have some odd impacts. The parents are also going through some sexual awakenings of their own. The plot line is refreshingly simple without antics or drama but the honest telling of a divorce story.
4,*&$(*#!,"This movie is really good, in many ways. The most remarkable thing is that kid, (Owen Kline??) who uses profanity better than any person I've ever heard!! I know there is a limited number of people who care about this sort of thing, but seriously, this kid OWNS the F word. Old masters like DeNiro and Pacino are taking notes. It's a new world order."
1,"Sad, sad, lives. Bad, bad, dicisions.","This movie was depressing. It showed the pathetic sides of humanity. There is no moral of the story; nothing for you to look forward to at the end. And worst of all, there was no redemption or forgiveness for the wrongs done.This movie stinks. Don't watch it."
1,This is below a 1 star!!!!!!,"This was not to my liking. Actually i found it disgusting!Watch out I'm a spoiler!I don't even know where to start. Well first the tennis teacher needs to finds something else to say than, ""Hey my brother"". Who wanted to throw the dvd case at the tv at that point and every other minute of the movie? I did!Then there the dad who wacks the mom with a ball. That was funny. And then she got pissed. Over exagerated! So she starts screwing the Ivan. Then the older brother plagerizes Pink Floyd's song ""Hey You"". How in the world did he get away with that? He said he wrote it and they believed him.Then the younger son starts drinking and saying the ""f"" word all the time. Then he tries to put on a condom! Yuck! And after that he humps the bookshelf of a library! Their parents are not parents. The boys have no respect for them. And why should they?!?I simply hated this movie. I WARN EVERUONE NOT TO WATCH, BUY, OR RENT THIS MOVIE! YOU'LL WISH YOU DIDN'T!"
2,No Gain,"This is a case of art copying life for no apparent purpose. The only conclusion one comes away from this movie with is that messed up adults make messed up chidren. Divorce is not good for children. Regardless of how well that story may be told in the movie, it is a long journey for so little. I see the same thing every day and the people are much more believable because they are real. I kept looking at my watch wondering when we would get to something. When the heart attack came I was so disappointed. Here was another plot point that would take us another twenty minutes to waste. I would not invite anyone to see this movie."
3,Strong Performances,"Not entirely satisfying, but not unsatisfying either. Daniels and Linney were good - both having the challenge of portraying unlikeable people while maintaining the audience's interest. I would have liked more of pieces of the movie - the younger son, for example, but it works without more."
3,"Ok, but overrated","I don't see what the fuss is about this movie. Yes, the dialog is a little more blunt than we are used to but not terribly clever. Hell, Zombieland had sharper dialog. Not to mention The World's Greatest Dad. Or Little Miss Sunshine. This was basically intellectual posing from a decent cast. Not a bad movie, but not worthy of awards. The Royal Tannebaums kicks it's ass in terms of quirky humor. As does Magnolia or Boogie Nights in terms of story arch. And if you want a smart movie with bad language, rent Bad Santa instead."
4,"""Very interesting, very dense...""","The Squid and the Whale starring Jeff Daniels and Laura Linney is a cooky, off-balanced and yet quite an interesting inide flick. This movie ends abruptly (running time only 80 minutes!) but the ending does solidify the title and how the eldest son Walt feels about his parents breaking up. I had no idea Kevin Kline's son Owen was the youngest and most disturbing son Frank. Of course the stars pull another great performance off and although the movie doesn't have a major plot, I thought it was a realistic portrayal of an American family going through a divorce in real time. I recommend this film to anyone who loves an offbeat indie flick, enjoy!"
5,Loved It,"This is a comedy of manners, about people who get divorced and about the effect on their children. I found it very powerful, and memorable. And, quite funny in places."
2,"well acted, but also well-worn material","Just as Walt didn't really write ""Hey You,"" it seems like Noah Baumbach didn't really write this. It's really nothing more than a rehashing of Judith Guest's ""Ordinary People."" Baumbach may respond that there are always new audiences, new settings, etc. But what, really, can this material teach us? That divorce can be messy, that kids can be psychologically hurt, and that the kids are often wide of the mark concerning which parent did what? Brilliant!"
3,Thought provoking sour drama....,"Very thought provoking realistic script with confronting aspects about divorce, marriage and sibling relationships. As art, amazing....As a viewing experience...I did not enjoy it at all."
3,Odd story,"I've heard so much about how good it is I was kind of disapointed. The parents are behaving badly, especially the dad (Jeff Daniels). I hated how he bad mouthed his mother. The mother isn't a saint either. She had affairs and didn't care that her husband knew. In fact, she would talk about them with her kids! So the kids act out. They really need them to act like parents and not buddies.The acting is good and it's only 81 minutes. Because of that I recommend it if you don't mind a movie that has a loose plot and don't need a neat tidy ending. But if you choose not to, you are not missing anything special."
1,pretentious filth.,"it seems to be a standard formula for ""up and coming"" artists in any genre to seek out the most offensive thing on hand -- ""That'll get my name out there!"" I'm not sure if that was the motivation here, but...as another has already said, watching a 10 year old actor (just a guess) perform the traits of sexual disfunction is not my idea of entertainment, enlightenment, art, or whatever label the creators might wish to apply. it's not only horrible to think of puting this poor young actor through this endeavor, it's quite unpleasant to watch.there are other reasons why this movie is deplorable, and many other reasons I'll never recommend it, but the above is enough for me. all things told, this is just another pretentious bit of cinematography attempting artistic merit."
2,The Squid and the Whale,I found this to be a very boring a slow movie that jumped around and does not hold your attention.
1,don't see this movie,I thought this movie was awful - it was very vulgar and graphic. I felt sorry for the child actor in it - I was shocked at the language and situations he had been put in. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I was very disappointed as I had read good reviews of it.
1,this is entertainment?,"I gave this movie one star because zero isn't an option. What a pathetic waste of time this movie is. ALTHOUGH I must admit I quit watching after the younger boy's ""personal party"" in the library. I can't believe any parent would let their child act in this movie. I found it so repulsive to think that not only did he have to play this degrading scene but he had to be coached and taught and had to practice. It borders on child abuse if you ask me. I certainly can live without watching a little boy degraded in such a disgusting way.Besides that scene, the characters were awful, boring, stupid people. Why on earth would the older boy idolize his jerk of a father? If I were 16 and my dad acted like that I'd be ashamed to be anywhere near him. Both parents seem to be stuck in perpetual adolescence. None of the characters are funny or likable.Again, I'll admit I didn't watch the entire movie. Even now when I think back on it I feel like throwing up. Good grief."
5,I'd Give This Movie 10 Stars If I Could,"One day I will give this movie the proper review it deserves. But succinctly: Baumbach has created a masterpiece--painfully honest and exceptionally ""real."" The dialogue feels accurate; the acting (on the part of ALL cast members) is remarkable. If you can't get beyond slight mistakes in Baumbach's creation of Brooklyn in 1986, or the foul language of the children, then you are missing the point. Approach this film openly. It has a lot of insight to offer, even if you've never found yourself in the same place these characters find themselves in."
3,Giving this a try to see what all the hype is about,"Aficionados of pop culture can't make it through the course of a day without hearing/seeing reference to 'Naruto.' After putting off this series for years I finally decided to give this one a shot and blazed through Volume #1 of Masashi Kishimoto's seminal 'Naruto' manga series.First impressions left me semi-interested. The story and concept is intriguing enough to keep me going at least a few more volumes to gauge whether or not I'm going to plow this series in its entirety. As fas as art goes my main complaint is that the action sequences (long fight chapters) can be difficult to follow at times. Also, based on this 1 book the overall tone feels seems to skew toward a younger audience so keep that in mind if you're wondering whether or not to take a chance with this series."
5,Read up,"Hey,guess what.Naruto is coming here on a plane called Cartoon Network and until then read,read,read.Anyway it is a great book that depicts ninjas as ordinary people (except for Naruto) trying to make it to the big leages of ninja ranks.There is a lot of course ninjutsu unlike you would ever imagin,using hand signal for signs of the Zodiac.Buy it and be warned.You will be a Naruto fan too."
2,They really DID kill Naruto,The Naruto manga is indeed a truly great manga series and also a great anime but they practically killed this series.. They really shouldn't have changed the names around.. its the names and the techniques that gives this series the true feeling for a great manga. Instead they really screwed up the names.. i didn't read the english manga but i followed the japanese one all the way to the updated volume. I must say this is truely one of my favorite animes but i really dislike what they did to the american version.. they should have atleast kept the name of the jutsus(spells).
3,"Ugh, they killed Naruto","Naruto is my favorite anime series/manga. The manga is about a boy (Naruto)who wants to grow up to be the strongest ninja in his village (Hokage.) Within 20 books, he fights against several strong kids. The action is like Dragon Ball Z, but the pacing is a lot faster.The translations are horrible. The ""Kage Bunshin no Jutsu,"" a technique that creates clones of the caster, becomes ""The Art of the Dopple Ganger.""Overall, Naruto is an excellent series, but Viz did a horrible job translating the manga. If you can try to download the manga, I know it is wrong with the series being released and all, but Viz or whoever translated the manga did a horrible job in my opinion."
3,Naruto - a great manga ruined by poor translation,"First off, whoever said that the anime was better, is simply an idiot. The manga far outstripes the anime in every category.Second of all, the attack should be called Kage Bunshin no Jutsu because that's what the author named it. Viz left original attack names in for Dragonball Z, so why not Naruto.I say, don't waste you're money, download fanscans."
2,They killed Naruto!!,"Viz really did a horrible job translating Naruto. I had expected alot better from them, but they disappointed me. If you wanna see what they messed up on (detailed) and want to help in getting it changed, you should go here:http://www.petitiononline.com/ts000vc/petition.htmlit's really worthwhile for all the diehard Naruto fans outhere."
5,I've watched the Anime and read the Manga...,"And I'm telling you, it's worth every penny! The fansubs are still out there, and I'm up-to-date with episode 90, and I've read the first and second Mangas. This series is an amazing feat of work and creativity!Naruto, a boy with the spirit of a Kitsune inside him, struggles to become the greatest Ninja ever! Action-packed, humorous, you'll laugh... you'll cry...you'll be very glad you bought this!"
4,"Good Book, translation frustrated.",I've read the home translated comics and they are far better than these ones. The books are great but i really wished they had have used the same names for the techniques that they did in the japanese ones.
5,A must read for anyone 13-29,"I want everyone to know that naruto is a great story for every age. The guts to never give up and never surrender. I get such a boner thinking about it, I mean right now I have a huge woody. Back to naruto and my raging boner later, every kid should read it, it is amazing."
4,"My son LOVES it, but...","You may not realize it is bound backwards, since it is a japanese book. Strange, since the words are in english."
1,HORRIBLE!!!,"I hate this series, so boring, dumb characters, FREAKIN CRAPPY NINJAS! DO NOT BUY THIS MANGA! Such a waste of money! I prefer magical girl mangas, that don't include crap ninjas! Please don't buy this if you hate dull, boring, and NON- magical girl manga!! Buy kamichama karin instead!!"
4,A Some-What Flawed Beginning,"Story:Naruto is an Undergrad Ninja Who, well... isn't a very good ninja. After He Fails the Final Exam for the Third Time and, Without Giving Too Much Away, a Teacher Tricks Him into Stealing a Forbidden Scroll. Naruto Than Creates 1,000+ Dopplegangers. He Graduates While Learning He Has The Nine Tails sealed inside him. Next He Must Face His Greatest Challenge Yet, Master Kakashi!7.8 out Of 10Characters:Naruto in My Opinon is Built Around the Characters, the Way Attract or Hate Each Other is very Well done. Kakashi makes me laugh and Naruto is Stubborn and Dumb, but somehow likeable. And Sakura, to say the very least is unlikeable. Sauskes a Jerk, but cool.8.5 out of 10Art:The in Naruto Differs, panel to panel. Background shots are beutiful. Faces and Bodys look weried at times but get better as the series progresses. The Cover Art is Ok and the back looks pretty legit.7.5 out of 10Overall...7.9"
5,Naruto - by Kishimoto Masashi-sama,"First of all, Naruto is Naruto.Do the translation of /names/ really matter?If you don't like Shonen Jump's translations, then go online and print out a list of names and their ""true"" translations.If you think the names are fine, then read the book and don't be a fool - to each their own.Names or not, Naruto is definitely worth checking out - if you like action, comedy, angst, drama or such, and even if you are looking for a character-driven read, Naruto is an excellent choice.Trust me, it's worth lovin'.And if it's not your cup of tea, then fine.it's not anyone else's problem anyway, right?^_^ And Sasuke-kun is /so/ cool..."
1,Melissa Flatware Set,This set is a piece of garbage. It has rusted where the handle meets the stainless steel and the pattern has faded right off. I contacted Pfaltzgraff about the problem and they had me return it and gave me a credit. This set is a total waste of money unless you only want to use it six months.
3,Didn't last too long after some abuse,"It worked OK for one season, after that it started falling apart. You might as well buy a 50 gallon plastic trash container with wheels or just use a regular blue tarp, that's what we use now."
1,don't even think about it,"this movie lies before you view it. the title does not match the movie ,so please let this one be. stupid movie with no plot and even less fighting.and yes,i watched the entire movie thinking ""it'll get better soon""..... that never came.waste of time"
3,Some Kung Fu Comic Fun.,"Two grudging masters both skilled in fighting and magic fight it out in hopes of deciding who the greater man is. Both with their own desciple each tries to find ways to hold the other one back. But while trying to disrupt each other they both find them selves in trouble of their own. Some good Comedy, and some surprisingly good fight sequences as well. Little too much talk for my liking but the fights made up for it. In my mind not a bad buy."
2,FuNNy,"is silly, maybe another time ot would b good, but if i was chinese maybe i would like this humor, or maybe i was expecting more serious.... nah it was bad directing"
1,Bad Martial Arts Movie,This movie is so bad that I had to throw it in the trash to give it a decent burial! Do not buy this movie!!!!
1,Sincerely Andy Rooney,"Andy Rooney's writings are usually well worth reading. The letters certainly were, and very enjoyable. However, I was more than shocked and offended by Mr.Rooney's attack of religion. This is one of his books I wished I had skipped."
1,Sad old fart,"Honestly, does it get any more sad and boring than this funny old guy? As if it's not bad enough that he clogs the airwaves every week with his silly moaning, now we have to have books too?"
5,This video...,"is really awesome. Although there are not so much good fights in this episode, the story is much better than the previous episode. I'd recommend it to everyone (cammy appears!) who loves martial arts anime!"
2,I thought this was the most boring series of all.,"Especially for this english version, dubbing is still bad. and in the Jap version of 20th episode, a new and cooler intro is introduced and of course new music. But, in this english version it is still the same ugly rock music. This version describes every exaggerated word in the dictionary. whatever you do get the Jap version instead... otherwise spray acid on your face to get other types of excitement."
1,Not very useful,Not alot of Diagnostic info. Basic maintanence info. I returned this book and bought the factory book. Much much more useful info.
3,Brakes,Good pictures and corresponding instructions. Helpful reminders for those of us who don't work on cars for a living.
1,Not the Chilton's of old,Incomplete information and mistakes resulted in lost time troubleshooting. Wiring diagrams are incomplete with some test instructions ie:emission/MAP sensor are vague and left me with unanswered questions.
1,Too sticky,"I love the Cinnamon Buns shower gel, so I thought I would try the lip gloss. For one thing, it smells/tastes nothing like Cinnamon buns. I don't know what the flavor is, but I don't like it. Maybe they have added almond or something. Secondly, it's way too sticky. My hair kept getting stuck to my lips. It reminds me of vaseline. Since I got this product in a kit, I cannot return it, but I will not be using it again."
5,Lipgloss,This was a Christmas present for a friend and she was just thrilled with it! I tried it on myself and Almost didn't want to give it away.
3,"For Bad Film Lovers Only! A ""How-not-to""...","Very bad, even for the price. I heard Fred Olen Ray spent $12,000 on this film and I'd like to audit his bookkeeping records because this does not even look like a $12,000 film. There is a lot of badly done day-for-night shooting, the edits are choppy and uneven, the FX and sound are subpar by any standard..I am a big fan of low budget videos and Fred Olen Ray.This is not without enjoyment,though more of a learning tool than a so bad its good classic.."
2,Let Down,"Normally I am a big fan of cheap, cheesy 1970s horror films, especially if they take place in swamps and star aging has-beens. So you'd think I'd love this film. Nope. For one thing it is too self-conscious: it actually TRIES to be funny but isn't. For another thing, whatever redeeming qualities the first half of the film may have, by the time you get to the second half it is so repetitious that it become extremely plodding. And there is no payoff at the ending because THE FILM HAS NO ENDING! Somehow Ray forgot to give the film either any sense of resolution or some sort of shock. I'd settle for even for a poorly done shock. But no, the film just ends when it could have similarly ended after the first 25 minutes.Even worse, the prologue Ray added to the beginning of the movie some time after he finished filming and everyone had gone home manages to make the non-ending even more of a non-ending. Now THAT was an accomplishment!"
3,"NOT SO BAD, I MEAN IT!","WHEN YOU WATCH A LOW BUDGET FILM MADE FOR AROUND 12,000 DOLLARS YOU ARE NOT GOING TO GET STAR WARS! Now that I said that I found this low budget film entertaining. It doesn't match the directors latter work in quality, [Fred Olen Ray], but the script was decent and watchable. Buster Crabbe gave a decent performance, and so did the rest of the cast who tried. Granted their acting was a bit rough. It has a good zombies VS us plot. It was fun and watchable like a 1950's style Sci-Fi. But it has a real 70's feeling to it. The soundtrack music was also quite good. When I read the other reviewers comments, it is as if they felt it should look like a million dollar plus film to be good. It won't for that money. It is very easy to say YOU STINK!, and laugh at anthing made cheap. No ultra low budget film will look like Star Wars. For the budget it was a good job. I saw it on TV around 1980 too."
1,HORRIBLE!!!,"This is the cheapest, worst movie ever made. The budget for the film must have been $9.50 ($5.00 of which was the payment to Buster Crabbe). The other $4.50 was for the videotape and payment to the remaining cast.I have this on videotape--and will replace it on DVD someday. As bad as the movie is, it is SO bad that it is hilarious to watch. Bad scripts, bad acting, bad special effects--it doesn't get any better (or worse?) than this."
3,Not Long Enough!!!,"I took a chance on purchasing a film with only 1 person rating it. Last time I do that.This is a decent DVD to watch. It does show you the fun you can have with the family racing a Hare Scramble style race.The video quality was good, the sound mix is good, you got music, and you can hear the bikes and quads easily without the music over powering it or drowning them out.But the problem with this DVD is the length. I feel the $18 plus shipping I paid for this item now to me seems to be to much. The DVD is but 20-30 minutes long...Had it been longer, it might have been worth the money.....Pros:Good video clarityGood sound mixGood mix between Quads, bikes, and tikes!!CON:OVER ALL DVD RUN TIME!!! TO SHORT!!"
4,These are so clever!,"The aquabells work great! I took them on a trip to Germany. Light and easy to pack, but easy to fill and give enough weight (and weight options)to be useful."
4,not bad at all!,"The book is very interesting, outlining not only the flaws it may have but working in a very scholarly manner! kudos to Baron Annanikian for its creation!"
1,Defective wheels,My husband and I thought this was a great machine until the wheels fell apart and we are being told over and over that the replacements are on the way meanwhile a month later they are saying its out of stock!!! We have been waiting for over 2 months. Wow this machine's wheels are sooo bad that they ran out of stock - I can only assume others have had similar problems. By the way neither my husband or I are over the weight limit.
2,good workout on a cheap built machine,"you get a good workout for the price until your 15 minutes into it and a wheel crumbles apart,i've put 3 sets of replacements on and still there not holding up."
3,Live or Recorded?,"This is a tough CD to comment on. It is full of great music which deserves to be heard, but which is often neglected. And Terfel is a great singer who, at least in person, is full of charm and wit which bubbles out through his performances. On the other hand, the other hand, this sound is way over processed and does not remotely resemble a real world performance of the works. For example, in ""Is my Team Ploughing"", Terfel does not actually sing the song the way that he would in performance, but rather plays ""mike"" tricks with a recording engineer on the dial. That is too bad. His ""real"" performance would have been all the more captivating.Perhaps, next time, Terfel can issue two versions... one with overprocessed sound and one ""unplugged"" in which his real sound can come out."
3,Vaughan-Williams Over Interpreted,"I love the Vaughan-Willams cycle, and I was puzzled and disappointed by this performance. Bryn Terfel's interpretation of the Songs of Travel is wildly overdone. He really milks every line and phrase for maximum vocal effect--totally over the top. This particular work requires a straight forward approach. Terfel's mannered performance undermines the direct emotional appeal of these simple, yet affecting songs.Much more successful is his rendering of the Butterworth, Finzi and Ireland where he shows great sensitivity to the subtleties of the texts. I really admire his fine performance in this less familiar repetory."
2,Over Done,"I agree with another reviewer that the sound on many of the tracks is way to produced and nothing like what a live recital would sound like. I do however think Bryn does a very good job of reciting the text so it's clear and does a good job of expressing what the music really is saying through his dynamics, etc. But his voice to me just has an over done sound. He also has some very odd vowels he uses when he sings that just seem awkward to my ears. I recommend to anyone who is a R. V. Williams fan and loves Songs of Travel to look into Gerald Finley's recording of the Songs of Travel (plus 14 other wonderful songs). Personally, I believe they are done much better then the versions on this recording and I also think that Gerald Finley's voice is just simply better."
2,Terfel's voice and manner not well suited to this repertoire,"I expected more satisfaction, delight from this CD than I received. Terfel is undoubtedly a major operatic talent, but his voice and style are too violent, brusque, lacking in variety for many of these selections. He alternates between a crude shout and a pianissimo. The lyrical, liquid mezzo voce that, say, Fischer-Dieskau commands is missing. To my ears he seems out of his element here."
5,Best Recording,"This Blend of English art song is fantastic a must have for any serious bass-baritone. Not only the always amazing and tremendous interpretation of song by Terfel but especially in the Finzi and Williams do we finally, I reitterate Finally, hear the story of the Young composers passion come out! Also another plus to Terfel, we hear the best bass baritone sound that I think I have ever heard from him! I have listened to every CD that he has made to date including the new silent noon and this is still my most frequently used selection. Also Coach accompanist take a listen to the way that Martineau plays this music it is infactuating! If you buy a Bryn Terfel CD I would reccomend this one!"
5,Terfel is terrific on this classic baritone repertoire.,"Glad to find this out of print cd. Bought a second one for a student baritone. Great service from the UK vendor, too."
3,Excellent selection of repertoire,"Bryn Terfel has an incredible voice and an outstanding sense of phrasing and expression. Dynamics are ""all over the place"" at times but other than that, this disc is a great listen. Noteworthy selections are Vaughan William's ""Songs of Travel"" and the Ireland pieces."
1,Rusted Very Badly after Only a Few Trips through the Wash`,These were supposedly dishwasher safe. My set is rusted after just a couple months of use. They seem pretty dull too.I have ... laser cut knives from the supermarket that have held up for 10 years with no rust and no loss of sharpness.I assume it is the ... Chinese steel being used for these that makes them so worthless.Save your money. I wish I had.
5,A Find,One of my top five choices for the 1990's. Now reading again with joy. A keeper in my library.
5,love and politics from a distant world,"An unbelieveable trip into the past... An epic love story set in England's oldest colony, Canada's newest province. Rich with characteres, the best of which is the NEWFOUNDLAND itself... Also startling is Sheila Fielding, easily the finest female fictional character to appear in years... What a movie this film will make. Yowsa!!! Yowsa!!! Every accomplished actress in Hollywood will want to star in this role... And what a glorious treat it will be to see the oild colony on the silver screen!!! I can't wait."
3,I was fooled...,"I think I was fooled by all the good reviews for this book. Though it was not bad, it certainly was far from a great reading experience. I didn't find it particularly entertaining or particularly informative. Sure, I might now know something about New Foundland, but the fact and the fiction are so tightly woven together, that I am not really sure of what I know. Speaking of the fiction, I thought the central mystery concerning a mysterious letter was rather absurd. Certainly, this is a commendable effort, the writing is solid, but I had to force myself to finish it."
4,Unrequited?,"This is a fantastic book. Johnston is definitely one of the best new comic writers coming out of Canada. However, he apparently doesn't know what the word ""unrequited"" means."
1,What a disappointment!,"I cannot imagine how anyone could give Colony of Unrequited Dreams 4 or 5 stars. After reading the positive reviews posted, I could hardly wait to get a copy of the book and start reading. Were we reading the same book?? Smallwood and Fielding were 2 of the most unappealing characters I have ever encountered, and I am a voracious and critical reader (1000-2000 pages per week on average) who regularly attends 3 different book discussion groups. And I am Canadian, just for the record.The two main characters were mule-headed and self-destructive to the extreme. They needed to be slapped silly. They were a complete turn-off, not to mention the very lame ending of the book. I regret the hours I wasted reading it."
1,This item is not Equivalent to the DR3 as Stated,I ordered this item as a replacement for a Duracell DR3 7.2V Lithium Battery. What I get is a Duracell DR9609 7.4V Lithium Battery which is not usable in my equipment.I will not be purchasing from this seller again.
5,Great career overview from a great singer!,"This is a great overview of Crosby's career with all great stuff. The third Cd is all great unreleased stuff and worth the price alone. This is a HDCD release and you owe it to yourself to get a HDCD capable player. All of the CSN, Neil Young and Grateful Dead releases are now in HDCD!This is heavenly music!"
2,compressed,I don't understand why so many engineers feel they have to improve the old mixes. it's as if they think the engineers of yesterday didn't know what they were doing. in this case they have smashed the life right out of this music with compression. Don't waste your money on 4 CDs of ruined music.
4,Great item!,"This is a great light weight foundation, moisturizes and covers well. when I'm in a hurry, which is quite often, this is my go to favorite make-up item!"
5,Return Buyer,"I purchased this Super Natural and loved it so much I turned around and bought another one! Light but smooth coverage, gives a""no make up"" look. At 56, less is more and the coverage makes pores disappear. It technically is a primer but I wear it daily as light makeup."
5,Amazing product!,"Tried this while on a beach vacation and I was very impressed. The feel and coverage of this product is very light and natural-looking but the sunscreen protection is invaluable. Lightly tinted, it applies smoothly and evenly and provides just enough coverage to enhance your skin without any greasiness or heaviness. It's a winner. I'm so pleased with it that I plan to use it year round."
5,Best tinted moisturizer ever!,"I like to use a product with moisture for my dry skin, but with a light tint. I most always wear this Philosophy tinted primer all by itself. I was impressed by the positive reviews and wanted to try it. I had never bought a Philosophy product before. This Supernatral Poreless/Flawless Tinted Primer was just that: Flawless. It smoothed over my skin and covered some small discolorations. It felt like silk going on my skin. It didn't make my wrinkles or pore stand out. I'm 72 and have my share of small wrinkles...smile and frown lines. All were covered by this primer. I wear it alone every day and couldn't be happier.!! I highly recommend it."
2,Nothing Supernatural Here,"Don't get me wrong, I am a diehard Philosophy fan. Just look in my makeup bag(s). I was looking forward to this product, as I thought what could be better than having a sunscreen and a pore minimizer all in one?!? The sad fact is, this product ""pills"" up when you use the Supernatural Foundation. Now, doesn't that just knock your hat in the creek? Yeah. Sharon Perkins, Cordele, GA"
3,Too Orange,"I recently ordered this primer to give it a try after Clinique discontinue the Pore Minimizer Instant Perfector, which for my super oily and large pores works great; and has nothing to do for large pores and oily skin. It's kind an orange, and under the sun looks awful. Not suitable for I think any skin tone.It's very greasy and horrible. Bad,bad choice."
3,just OK,It does not cover large pores as I expectedand it is expensive for the little results I got from using it. It does go on very smoothly and I like the sunscreen aspect.
5,Provides a natural look,"I hate looking ""made up"" so I love this product. I've used it for a year or more, and usually wear it alone - not as a primer. It minimizes the appearance of my pores and evens out my skin tone, but feels very lightweight. It literally glides on. A little goes a long way, so the tube lasts a decent amount of time."
2,broke out,"While I LOVE most philosophy products and can't live without my ""regulars"" I was disappointed with this one...it made my sensitive skin break out after a couple of days of wearing it. Will not use."
4,Recommend,"First, let me say that I have acne and oily skin. No matter what primer I have ever used (MAC, Smashbox), I usually end up with at least one break out by the end of the day if I wear it constantly. That being said, Philosophy Supernatural has actually minimized my pores. I rarely get break-outs when I wear this tinted primer alone!Second, as a primer, it's not the best. My skin still remained oily after a few hours when I wore foundation and powder over the top. Perhaps it is just my skin type, and I will forever be oily.I am satisfied with this product and I would recommend it to anyone. It did a wonderful job at minimizing pores and my skin had less breakouts overall. Sometimes, I even just wear this product alone with a bit of mascara on the weekends because I've gained more confidence in my skins 'natural' look :)"
1,Bad for my skin,"This product did not work great for me, though I can see why it would work better for others. I have large pores, so daily use of supernatural actually increases my acne. The color of the product is also more...orange than I was expecting, so as a redhead I have to add a layer of powder to avoid looking sunburned no matter how little I use. If you are a redhead who likes looking tan it might work for you, but I have to stick to the pale. I still use it as a base on special occasions since I paid for it, but once it is gone I won't buy it again."
4,"philosophy the supernatural poreless, flawless spf 15","It's good as a makeup base. However, if you don't lilke the silicon base, I would not recommand this product."
2,Re: color,"I have a basic medium skin and this ""tinted"" is much to peachy/orange for me. Not what I expected from description and Philosphy. I love their exfoliating mask and other products."
2,not too happy,"I dont really find how this primes your skin for makeup. It does have sort of greasy feel, even though it is lightweight. It doesnt make my skin look better, or help my makeup stay on longer."
2,Buy a different set...,"The game itself is pretty fun. I come from a long line of avid Horseshoe players, so this was a nice game to play since it plays out very similar, yet it has an extra air of challenge (or ease, however you want to look at it). The only problem was that we were cheap, and I guess it's true that you get what you pay for. This product is terrible. It isn't too sturdy, although I did like the idea that the bottoms were curved so as to maintain balance without putting holes in your yard. The biggest problem was the balls. Being attached to a small rope that you toss, these balls aren't tied on very well and they fall apart with ease. That wouldn't be so bad if retying them would prove helpful, but at the most it will sustain two more tosses before they have to be retied AGAIN. The game is great, but this particular product is awful. Spend a little more money and get yourself a superior product; I know I'm going to!"
2,Tastless Cliche,"I have seen a number of different anime and this one was very original, but unfortunatly it is very cliched--Another story about a ""guy who all the women want""--and they take it to new gratuitous levels.The animation is very good (like Video Girl Ai) and the story is funny as long as you don't mind some of the tastless jokes--like the girl who farts when she's nervous tries to seduce the ""Mega Playboy""--I think that says enough."
2,"Stark, ugly playing from two anti-Romantics","Call it alaienation, I dn't know, but when they got together, Argerich and Kremer found themselves of like mind: Beehoven should be performed with no romance or heroism, with stark, edgy tone and banging accents. It's not my kind of Beethoven at all, so I will stck with Perlamn/Ashkenazy on Decca for both works."
5,Sollscher arrangements & artistry compliment Beatles scores,"So many musicians have tried their hand at the Beatles' music over the years. It has seemed to me that all of them have either created elevator music or awkwardly pretentious, pseudo-symphonic disasters. Enter Goran Sollscher who uses his impressive skills on the classical guitar to create a recording accessible to all tastes. Sollscher brings out a beauty in Lennon's and McCartney's scores that we haven't heard before. In more than a few of the tracks, Sollscher's arrangements are better than the originals. His style is smooth and melodious, very upbeat. His ability on the guitar is quite extraordinary. Sollscher's CD gives us the Beatles all over again."
2,Not what I was expecting!!!,I want the DVD that the other reviewers got!!! This video has nothing to do with stretches or with helping your hands. this video is relaxing like watching paint dry and grass grow. It is very relaxing... boring too. I would have to be in a relaxed state to enjoy it though. Would probably be fantastic as background video during yoga class or to play during reiki or a chiropractic session.
5,Great malcolm,"This is a great book for the period of time in Malcolm's life that might be the least covered. Not to long of a read, but full of information not readily available when looking for Malcolm.It dispels the idea of Malcolm just being a racist anti Semite, how he was portrayed by the media during and after his life, but installs the belief that he was a revolutionary fighting for the human rights of all, and nothing could more truthful."
1,Sub-standard product,"Although I received my order quickly the quality of the product was sub-standard. The image shows black tipped feathers, but the ones I received are a blotchy green. Several are in such poor condition that they are unusable. Several more are poorly trimmed or have notches torn out of them. Next time I'll pay extra and purchase feathers locally."
3,Great Product & Company,I had a rush order and the feathers came just in time! The feathers were in great condition and were perfect for my craft project.
4,This was not a toy,These came in great condition and I was able to use them for the project I intended.
4,Just not enough for the price!!,The glue is very strong and will hold. Just too runny and watery. Also for the price I ran out of glue in the middle of my project. Felt I paid too much for too little.
3,"""Liquid Control"" level of control pending assessment","Update: I've upgraded my rating from a 1 to a 3, pending further use of this product. I do appreciate the fact that Henkel Loctite is endeavoring to put out a much needed improvement for Super Glue application, and perhaps I was in the wrong for my initial go at using it described below.Initial review: Right or wrong, I was holding this glue dispenser upside-down after breaking its seal. I then pressed its sides to put a drop of glue on a simple repair to a book light, and I got a flowing river of glue. As I type here, I've got glue stuck to three-fingers on one hand, and two on the other ... after 20 minutes or so of cleaning efforts, not exactly tonight's plan. And I've got glue stuck to the outside of my new book light lamp; I doubt it will come off, but I'm trying."
1,would not recommend,only able to use once. i followed all the directions and still the top glue itself shut. Not worth the money.
3,Does the trick.,Ordered this to fuse to bits of metal together and its done its job well. I would buy this stuff again. I like the design of the bottle and the cap prevents clogging and the little orange grips on the side control flow. Did not glue myself to anything once!
3,So hoped this would work...,"Generally I try to stick with established brand names. So after 'Scotch Super Glue' failed to bond a snapped plastic eyeglass frame I figured, okay, let's give Loctite a try.Sorry to have to report it made no difference. The two parts just would not adhere regardless of how long they stayed in contact.To be fair to the former however, its instructions do say ""Not suitable for...polyethylene and polypropylene."" I don't know what these frames are made of, but it could be one of these.The reason I even bought Loctite was because it does _not_ mention that restriction. So maybe Loctite was a different formulation that would work where the other did not?But, no. It was like trying to reattach something with honey. After a minute as soon as the parts were released they fell apart.Still, I'm going to keep Loctite around because I've no doubt it will work as reported by other reviewers for non-plastic breakages."
3,New Car Smell?,"This has a fresh scent that is harsh at first but lightens up later. Does not smell anything like a real new car, and also does not smell like other profesional New Car scents you get at the local car washes. Last about two weeks when sprayed generously on interior.A plus is that it will not stain your interior and leave no residue (SP)."
3,Decent,"Came later than expected, unfortunately. But once I contacted the seller, item was received two days later. Wasn't EXACTLY what I was hoping for, but ordering costumes online is tough anyways. ;) All in all, I'd recommend this seller and buy from again!"
2,Constructive criticism,"Let me first say, God bless you, more r&b singers need to use the talent that God gave them to honor Him.However, this album shows that Michelle William's strenght lies in her ability to harmonize, but as a soloist she is sorely lacking. On some songs she does well when she sticks to lower octaves, but too often she sounds like a 10-year-old singer who has not grown into her full voice yet. If she sticks to lower octaves she has the potential to be awesome. But right now she does not have the power and strength to carry an entire album and her duet with Shirley Cesear shows that she is way out of her league. There is no song that truly touches me and she does not include even one standard gospel song. All are contemporary christian pieces, but she would have done better to mix it up a bit. The best song was the one she did with Destiny's Child, which is where she should stay."
4,"All i have to say is ...... ""You care for me""","The song you care for me is the best song on the cd also with heaven,so glad, and heart to yours. And because she doesnt get a chance to show off her vocals, as much in DCHild, she can sang. She is defintely one of the better singers in DC her and Beyonce, sorry Kelly. She has a great voice and the heights she reaches in ""You care for Me"" are heart wrenching, she can actually sing, and I hope because of this outstanding achievement when DC gets back together we'll hear a lil bit more from Michelle!"
3,Not bad,"Warning you will not hear no Bootie songs on this CD. The CD is unexpectedly nice. She demonstrates that not only Beyonce can sing. It is not my favorite, but I definitely have heard worse."
2,Hmmm.......,"With a voice not nearly as velvety as Kelly Rowland's, and with music not nearly as explosive as Beyonce's, poor Miss Williams doesn't have a whole lot going for her, especially when you consider who she is almost forced to be compared against. This is an incredibly slow, quiet, mellow Gospel album that is NOT for people hoping for more of Destiny's Child or even for Michelle fans whose first exposure of her was through Destiny's Child. Extremely religious. I really can't get into anything here. I loved Destiny's Child, but despite a few nice hits by Beyonce and Kelly's ""Dilemma,"" I really can't draw too much enjoyment from their solo stuff. They should get back together and stay together."
1,Go back to singing backup for Monica,I did not know you could jack gospel up. This CD will make you hate gospel if you are first time listener. This is the worse gospel CD. The only good song on the album was Steal away with Jesus because of Pastor Shirley Ceasar. The remake of Heaven is an insult to the great BeBe and CeCe Winans and family.
5,Heart to Yours....Excellent!!,"Heart to yours is a beautiful cd that really ministers to your spirit. The messages behind the songs ""Heard a Word"" and ""Care for Me"" are so comforting and really gives you a sense of what Gods promises are to you and just how much He truly loves us. The song, ""Heart to Yours"" is just a beautiful love song meant for the Lord, when I first heard it, I was man this is how I feel... Even though he is not old enough, I will tell you my six year old son loves the songs ""Sun Will Shine Again"" very uplifting and uptempo..just makes you smile. He also loves ""Rock with ME"" (well, actually we both really like this song!) It has a ROCK style with it and it definitely gets you up and moving and praising God through dance. Michelle, did a wonderful job on her debut and I pray for her continued success. She has been an blessing to me...Thanks Michelle..."
2,ALICE COOPER COULD HAVE MADE A BETTER GOSPEL CD....,"Weak~ weak~ weak!Could this be the worst GOSPEL CDs ever produced ? Very possible !MICHELLE WILLIAMS totally misses the mark and is misproduced on a collection of tipid songs ment to inspire.A total waste of time, money and effort. A strong point with this CD is the cover art work (nice picture to look at).Unfortunately, what's inside the cd package is not as pleasing for a consumer.Ms.Williams, having limited vocal range, ventures blindly into the demanding musical realm (GOSPEL). The nature of Gospel music requieres that a vocalist projects emotion and soul during a vocal performance.MICHELLE barely manages to breathe into the microphone.Her vocal performance ressemble a pale closing number at tuesday night karaoke bar near the outskirts of town. She sounds as if she is attempting to imitate the breathy vocals of OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN in 1973.This is possibly the worst CD of 2002. Such a pretty girl with little direction."
1,This is the worst album!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the worst album i have ever heard, it sounds worst than the voice of the singer Ashanti. I am sorry but she sounds like a wounded puppy lost in the woods and sings like she has lungitus and she to really needs to shut up!!!!!! And stay out of the music business forever and go find out who she really wants to serve.P.S Why did Destiny's Child choose her to sing in the group they already had a bad singer Beyonce"
2,Once a Secular Artisit...Always a Secular Artist!,"Although this CD has some very nice tracks, I believe once you sing secular music, you are a secular artist. After reading some of the reviews, it's obvious that regardless of her singing gospel music (which she needs to work on), Michelle is still a secular artist, no matter what her morals may be. In spite of her love for Jesus, Michelle is still singing about being ""Bootylicious"" and gyrating in her music videos, and now she wants to go and sing gospel, she's only contradicting herself, and not leading the life of a Christian! After this album, she'll be back with Destiny's child and singing about things that don't pertain to Christians, she should just stick with one thing, instead of being a hypocrite and trying to be like the world."
1,Michelle Williams,"I bought this cd on faith because in general, gospel albums are pretty good and uplifting. The talent is usually awesome and you wonder why the gospel singer does not receive more recognition in the world. However, this one was disappointing!. It was so bad. Ms. Williams needs a lot of work on her vocals. I don't want to say she can't sing but maybe with some coaching she might, just might get better. I can tell that alot of money went into the arrangments but the featured artists outshine her by light years. Don't waste your money!"
5,Not into gospel....,"Ok the truth is that im not christian, im agnostic and only got this album because i love michelle was my favourte destiny childs memeber. She just seems so nice and kind hearted. So anyhow back to the album. I think micheele did a very good job but didnt show off her full vocal abilities. She has had solo's with DC and she sounded alot different then what she does on here, However i think thats how she wanted it to be. Very soft and very smooth. I dont think that the production on this album is that well done either. I really hope michelle makes another solo album, maybe perhaps a non-gospel album, but either way great job michelle!!!"
3,Heard A Word,"Michelle please leav Destiny's Child and be a solo singer. I love this album for so many people. Standout songs-""Heard A Word+""-this one is just fabulous, ""Steal Away To Jesus""-Just Beautiful, ""You Cared For Me""-this one here defiantely showcases Michelle's stunning voice. Move over Beyonce."
3,Fine First Album,The first time I heard this album I didn't like it but it's grown on me. Michelle actually sounds nervous in the first three songs but once she seemed to be comfortable she soars. If you like classic gospel this will not move you. This is strictly pop gospel or gospel lite. If Miss Williams gets a producer who is truly all about her best interests her next solo album will really be amazing.
3,Something Sweet,"This cd is nice and mellow. The songs are soft and loveable. Simply speaking, buy it to support Michelle."
4,Served me well,"I bought those a few years ago and they have served me very well. They are exactly what I expected, very decent but not up to what I have now, a Global set."
3,Poor quality,"Ive had this set for about six months now. They were great in the beginning but they lose their edge easily so be prepared to put the sharpening tool to use. There are rust spots and other miscellenious spots on the blades, some can be washed or scraped off, some can't. In hindsight, I should have bought a more expensive set for the sake of quality and durability."
4,More than just your money's worth,I took a flyer on this set of knives and although this is not a $500 set it is worth every penny and then some. The knives came sharp and they keep their edge if you give them a little TLC. I would recommend them to anyone that asked.
3,Ok I guess,"I thought this would be quite a score, and I guess if you just ""want some knives"" it is, but I was really disappointed when they arrived. They weren't sharp AT ALL. This may sound masochistic, but I ran my finger along the blades and couldn't have cut myself if I tried. To be honest, I never even used them. I was so disappointed I just sent them back immediately. If you are just looking for a bunch of knives that can cut perform some basic functions then you are getting a deal. But if you are looking for some kind of quality or looking for an investment, look elsewhere. I am."
3,you get what you paid for,"Some dots appeared on the chef's knife after first use. These are not rusty dots but can't be rinsed off. The shears are my favorite, though. Storage block is of cheap quality. But what can be expected for under 25 bucks:-|"
5,This is a great documentary!,"I bought this DVD yesterday, (the day it came out), and I must say, I really enjoyed it. It could have been better, but overall, I'd say it's great!"
2,It's not the whole (or even part of the) music video,"I am really dissapointed!I searched for the nirvana music videos and was hoping toget the actuall music videos to the nevermind CD.But NOOO! I'ts CRAP! the only part of the actual video you get to see is about the first 5 seconds then it fades to the prouducer who explains how he recorded the song!!!!I was misled into thinking that an actual collaboration of full music videos exsisted!All I wanted was to be able to watch the whole music video.This DVD is more for the recording art student who desires to learn about the way in witch the songs were recorded, not for the average Nirvana fan.Peace, and Chicken Grease."
1,No Music!!,"From the cover I expected to have either the music videos or live video of the songs listed on the cover. There wasNO - full songs on the DVD.If you just want a documentary about the band, then you may like it. Personally I turned it off after I could not listen to any music."
5,Neato!,"I just purchased these after going through soooo many pairs where the ear buds would not stay in my ears. That is very frustrating.These were very reasonably priced and the sound quality is superb. So far, I am very very pleased with these headphones.I'll keep you all posted..."
5,retaliation,"for the above reviewer, too academic you say, how much so are you the general reader. i'm 20, in my second year at uni studying classical greece and it's at a level to which everyone can read. it is an insult to the general readers intelligence that you refer to it as too academic. may i suggest concentration!"
1,this book sucked.,"uhh no... if ur interested in the Spartans then dont get this boring book. this book was like that terrible text book u were forced to read in school. dry, boring, drained the life out of you."
1,TOO ACADEMIC,"This book is not for the general reader interested in Sparta or Greek history. It is much too academic, with numerous references to other Greek scholars and to their writings. I know Paul Cartledge is an expert in the subject, but because of the schoarly manner in which this book was written, I just could not finish it."
2,Bad text conversion,"the reading pleasure of the book is often interrupted by missing letters, wrong accents, wrong punctuation and some missing words. Look for another version if available."
1,Echo... echo... echo... echo...,"Fairy Tales and Fables Jack & the Beanstalk contains three short animated fairy tales: Jack and the Beanstalk, the Emporer's New Clothes, and Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves. While this video follows the story of the fairy tales very closely, the animation is terrible, and whoever did the sound had a fetish for echo. May be appropriate for young children when the baby-sitter is the only adult who has to listen to it. Buy at your own risk. There are much better versions out there."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"This book was impossible to read, full of a PH. D's arrogant use of extensive and irrelavent vocabulary. He spent so much time trying to sound intelligent that any information gleaned from this text is dilutted to nothingness.i reiterate, do not buy this book, it is a waste of money and time."
5,Original work that deserves more exposure.,"I purchased ""DeLuxe"" about five years ago and never tire of its clever juxposition of biting wit with ""easy listening"" music that really is anything but. I hope Todd Levin produces more works of this caliber. The London Symphony (well known for its ability to meld pop with classical) was superb on this recording. I highly recommend this highly original work."
3,Blur,"I attended a concert by the Minnesota Orchestra featuring works by modern composers, and Levin's work Blur was among those presented. I found in the piece a certain resonance with my own lifestyle: frenetic, occasionally discordant, but never dull. I purchased the recording for that reason and continue to enjoy that particular work. By the others, I find myself variously affected. It's definately not the average composition and probably won't appeal to those who look for relaxation in their musical choices."
4,"First rate brand new unit. No instructions, though.","The remote arrived in great condition. It works perfectly, and, I would buy from these folks again.My only problem was that programming instructions were not included with the remote. I had to dig up the original manual for my Dish Network system. I got lucky, and, found it."
5,Dish Network 6.0 IR/UHF Pro Remote,This company is the best and stands behind their product. The first remote I received didn't operate correctly and when I emailed the company they sent another in its place. This company is reliable and safe to buy from because they stand behind their product sales. I would recommend buying anything from them because of the good treatment and the buyer treatment I received.
1,Faulty remote,"I purchased this remote control online. Unforntunately, the remote control I received will not function properly. As a result, I had to order another remote control from the servive provider(DISH). I have NOT been able to resolve the matter with the seller. I would NOT recommend this seller"
1,they sent me junk,the item I recived did not work and was in the poorest of shape it was tossed out with the wrapping
5,Overview of Ethiopian History,"If you are reading this review you are looking for books on Ethiopia or African History. This book is well worth the time and money, especially if your goals are as specific as Ethiopia. I bought this in the stages of planning a trip to Addis Abeba and enjoyed the academic approach - so it should be understood that it is more of an academic approach to Ethiopian History. It may not fit the needs of all. May be dense for some.If for a university course or research consider yourself lucky, add this to your cart now. It is this kind of book.If you wanted a softer, yet still revealing read,In Search of King Solomon's Mines, is a great addition here to your hunt on Ethiopian literature."
2,Censored,"After a long wait I finally received this ""Beautifully remastered import from Korea"" only to discover that it has been censored! I know that this is not the fault of the seller, but it should be known by anyone who might purchase it. Certain scenes go black with only the soundtrack and Korean subtitles (presumably explaining what ""naughty bits"" have been barred from view). An exasperating disappointment. This is one of my favorite films and it has been impossible for me to find a decent copy."
1,Horrible quality,"This item is a piece of crap. It feels like it's solid plastic, and is so stiff that I can't bend it the way it should bend with all the force of my arms, let alone with my saddle. There is NO give to this item and I can't imagine how it could possibly make any saddle more comfortable for a horse. What's worse is that the company who sells it is so uncooperative that it is going to cost me more to return the item to them than it cost me to purchase the item plus shipping. Very unhappy."
1,Worthless,The edges on this pad are so stiff and almost sharp - painful even. I would never put this on my horse. This is extremely disappointing because I have an older riser pad that looks just like this that is discolored and I wanted a new one to show in. This goes in the trash. I am not even returning it because I would hate for it to get resold - the edges are too rigid to be comfortable on any horse.
4,"Great, but not perfect","The sound was fantastic and I really liked how you could switch between venues during certain parts of the songs. The show was great and there were actually very few songs that I missed. In fact, it was a great sampling to show to a friend who had never heard or seen Helloween before.Why is wasn't perfect? The picture quality could have been better, but it was definitely not as bad as suggested by some other writers. I have a 50"" Plasma HD TV and bad quality would have looked horrible on this TV. It did not, but I would have loved HD capability, as several others bands (albeit with greater budgets, e.g., Iron Maiden) provide for their DVDs."
1,Bad.....,"This is again a typical HElloween II concert, playing their bad music and ruining the classic tunes which they didn't even write. Miss the real HElloween? Check out Gamma Ray, you'll be happy you did."
1,The reason why this cost so much $$ couse they don't make,"Geforce3 is old card, it was introduced in 2001 January.The reason this card cost so much money because it last and OLd edition.Very hard to find. And the price was not changed since this card was realised.This is insane price, for old card and for 64MB.Gefrorce4 is 100% better than this.Don't buy this card, for sure the worst upgrade for your PC for this price, Unless this card would cost less than hundred dollars."
2,No Geforce 3 series card is worth more than 50 bucks,There must be an error in the pricing of this card.No Geforce 3 series card is worth more than 50 bucks.Even brand new.Maybe the decimal point was misplaced...
4,"Impeccable Fourth, Pretty Good ""Emperor""","I purchased this disc since I had come to enjoy Kempff's playing of the Beethoven sonatas, and I was mostly pleased.Kempff's performance of the G-Major Concerto is the best I have ever heard: lyrical and luminous, mysterious in the slow movement, boisterous in the finale, passionate but introverted, as the music itself is. These qualities do hamper him a bit, however, in the ""Emperor,"" a piece which finds Beethoven in his extroverted, public-square-on-display mood. Kempff's playing, while superb, lacks some of the necessary elan to make the performance completely satisfying. For both concertos, Ferdinand Leitner and the BPO provide a wonderful accompaniment, and the winds get to be heard more than von Karajan usually let them.Recommended."
2,Huge Disappointment,"Beethoven's 4th Piano Concerto maybe the best ofall piano concertos up to the present time. And, Iwas so looking forward to hearing Mr. Kempff'sperformance with the Berlin Philharmonic afterreading some of the reviews on this site.Alas, I was terribly disappointed by this audition.Very amateurish and painful to endure. I'm trulysurprised that it was deemed suitable for publicdistribution.To begin with, Ferdinand Leitner's direction ofthe orchestra was erratic and extreme. Very un-even and too melodramatic. (At times itseemed like he was competing with Wilhelm andthen trying to drown him out.)Mr. Kempff smoothly rippled off the trills andmulti-octave scales--hitting all of the right notes.Rather mechanically pounded out the arpeggios.Laid eggs on both of the major cadenzas. And,overall, completely missed the spirit and soul ofthis concerto."
1,Not the truth,"I know all the players and he is not truthful... I like and honest view, even if I appose the problem.. This man lied.."
1,facts are true author did not do all he says in book,although the events described in the book are very real author mclaughlin portrays himself as the hero that is far from the truth.he exagerates his role.
2,Poor build quality / low performance,"Arrived with two casters loose and all front panel button jammed 'on' - they are still jammed on; not a big problem as this is how I want to use the machine, but would be problem for others.Not particulary effective either - expensive for delivered performance and build quality."
2,Nothing but the shapes,"This is a book for beginners who are intrested in Jazz guitar solo and comping on blues by Herb Ellis Method. It introduce it's Shape System which is simply how to play scale and chord arpeggio by shape.The materials are few in this book. It mentioned only 1.how to paly Maj and 7 chords/scale/Arpeggio. 2.1 baisc progression and changes. 3. examples - 3 blues(solo) songs.Though m/dim/m7b5/... could be derived from the same concept, this book only introduce how to play chord/scale/arpeggio 'by shape' over Maj and Seven.For beginner this is a guide for chord/scale system. For people who already knew chord/scale system this book is nothing new, except the 3 improvised solo. ""Joe Pass on Guitar"" has more stuff in similar topics. Recommend only for beginners and people who are intrested in Herb Ellis's style."
4,Great 3D for a enjoyably stupid movie,"OK,there is not really much to say here except that if you like to show off your field sequential 3D set you should have this disc as the depth is great and there is almost no ghosting in the entire film. The Plot is pure ham and cheese. A whacked out scientist steals the original manuscripts for Dracula, Frankenstein,The Werewolf of Paris, and The Mummy and begins to suck out the life force of a young librarian in order to bring the essence of the archetypes contained in the books to life.( I told you it was stupid)Before the entire experiment can transpose the girl escapes midway through and we are left we pint sized versions of the classic monsters who are none too happy about their current height.If you can accept a movie on the level of a Police Academy or Earnest goes to Camp then you should not have a problem with this. Only major gripe is that there is not enough in your face gags but compared to steaming dung like Camp Blood this is a masterpiece."
1,Yes 1 star,"I purchased the movie because of the 3D. Big mistake the 3D is so bad it is unwatchable because of multiple shadows this is the worst 3D technology I have ever seen. Before writing this I waited for my order of the good red and blue anaglyph glasses to come in thinking the paper glasses were the problem. They made no difference. The acting is poor, though I thought the theme was kinda cute, and that is the only reason I gave it one star. don't waste your money."
2,3D is just not ready for TV,"Quality of the product left a lot to be desired. However, the seller has no control over the technology invilved. So far as the seller is concerned, the item arrived in a timely manner and I have no complaint.Sorry for late submission of feedback."
5,an amazing and soulful journey,"If you like well crafted, reflective, acoustic music, you should give Chuck E. Costa a listen. His amazing gift for words cut to the heart of the matter, whether it is the confusion of our current political state or the the joy of just have a great time,.Chuck captures it with a beautiful rhythm, a turn of the phrase, and a pure experience for the listener. It is refreshing to hear harmony and unplugged guitar with poetry lately; and this is the greatest companion to long drives and reflective moments. ""Old Glory"" is a great favorite, as it poignant lyrics and catchy tune will attest to, but I also love ""Six Honest Serving Men"". I love this new artist; and know that great things are coming from such a great songwriter and musician. And hey, if you get to hear Chuck performing live, take it while you can!"
2,Food for thought,"The book was purchased as a gift, and read prior to giving...it is not particularly well-written, although it does offer some helpful insight into the feelings that are rarely addressed surrounding adoption (i.e. the father's feelings)."
5,THE standard in the studies of Paul the Apostle!,"Following up on the concise and informative views of Teaching As Jesus Taught, Roy Zuck has taken the next step. Many students of the Bible really do not think Paul a teacher, but well, how else could he have helped established Christianity in Europe and Asia? Zuck details almost exactly, the strategies and methods used by Paul and how we can learn and use these tools!"
1,misleading,If what you are selling is a pack of 4 markers why does your photo show 8 markers? You are misleading customers and I hope you don't make any sales.
1,True Ceramic Pro,I purchased this product and after approximately six months it stopped working. Customer service was not helpful at all. Do not waste your money.
1,NOT TRU!,"I also fell for the Infomercials, and it did work GREAT at first, then I noticed my hair wasn't looking to great and started breaking off, and the red paint was chipping, I had a very hard time getting through to customer service, but they were very nice, when I did get a hold of them, I got 2 replacements, both chipped, and finally they refunded my money. Oh, and the last one, just stopped working, on top of chipping. And it is metal underneath the red paint. I wonder if they will get sued?? Some sort of class action thing?! it really did ruin my hair, I had very long beautiful healthy hair, almost down to my butt...now my hair is shoulder length and still dead!"
1,Lasted Less than a month!,I waited for over a month to receive my TCP. I had it for less than 3 weeks and it started sparking and smoking! Not only that the red was starting to come off the plates! I called the customer service dept. and they told me that I could send it back and they would send me another TCP but they were on back order and I would have to wait another month or more to receive it! I decided to check elsewhere and found one on the web at Folica for less money and received it in less than 4 days! I do not recommend the TCP as it will not last! It will straighten your hair but it could smoke and spark! I suggest you look elsewhere and spend your money with someone who has a product that will work and that has good customer service!
4,"mine works just fine, thank you","I ordered the TCP and on it, the paint did chip off. The fix: call their customer service, give them the warranty info they provide you, mail it back and they send you a new one free. My second one works just fine and straights my hair so shiny and soft. The product is as bad as people say and if it has problems, just let them know. They gave me no problems at all."
2,True Ceramic Pro Quits working,"Although I did not purchase from Amazon, I purchased two of these for my daughters, They absolutley love them, however they quit working after 2 to 4 week of using. That really ticks me off."
2,Give me more bang for my buck,"I picked up this book as part of some research for a novel I am working on. Alas, this pamphlet offers much less information than one would hope from a tabulation of America's most well-known hit song chartmakers.If this and a few of the other Billboard books were combined into one binding and given a mid-list price, I think I'd be more satisfied with the purchase. As it is, this computer generated list was too little effort and information for the coverprice.Given that it's computer generated and requires roughly *no* imagination to produce, why can't they assemble a couple more lists and even update this thing? It's been over five years!Not recommended."
4,"Great for D.J's, fans and music historians","It's more like the year to year in number 1 songs for Billboard, it has also a good selection of the best sellings LP's of all time. It's a great way to search for the songs who were reigning at the charts, I love the 80's so it's a great compliment book to the Top 40.Get it if you are a music fan...you'll love it!!!"
2,Great for putting you to sleep...,"But is that what this great music is supposed to do? I think not. If this set were available at a bargin price, say a two-fer, I MIGHT recommend this to someone who is on a really, really tight budget. But with what I believe are the two greatest sets of Nocturnes ever set to record (Rubinstein and Arrau) available for about $24, this one is an also-ran. These are pleasant, well played, but ultimately faceless and bland performances - Chopin for people who buy those ""the most relaxing music in the world"" types of CDs. The sound, like most that DG produces for piano recordings, is pingy and lacks true depth. The 25 year old Arrau and 35 year old Rubinstein offer a richer, more natural piano sound. Skip this one."
1,same here,"For some reason, my player's tray is now in locked mode and I've got a rented DVD stuck in there. The owner's manual is useless -- instructing me toward commands that don't exist in the setup menu -- and getting through to someone who can answer this seemingly simple question has been a nightmare."
4,Here is how I fixed it,"I bought this player in Costco about 4 years ago, and used it primarily to listen CD's. Recently it started acting funny saying all my CD's were bad. I disassembled it: took off the cover, and pulled out the dvd-reader device. All it took was unscrewing a dozen of screws. Then I took a q-tip and cleaned Lens AND a PRISM on the bottom side of the dvd reader. I didn't have alcohol so I used some bodyspray on the q-tip. After I put it all together it works fine, and starts playing CD's much faster then it used to after I insert a CD in."
1,Broke within 2 years,"Well, at least I got 2 years out of it, but my expectations for reliability are more on the order of more than 2 years. one star. avoid this product."
5,Grooveyard rocks with BBB!,"This was the last cd from Blindside Blues Band that I had to buy to complete my catalog of their releases. I own them all from the 1993 s/t to the last release ""Rare Tracks"" and I gotta tell ya, this band is awesome! In the beginning (first 4) they started out as a bit more of a heavy blues band, but as they progressed into hard rock/blues more in the Robin Trower/Jimi Hendrix style Mike Onesko's playing just seemed to get better, and better, and better. These guys rock, and in my opinion is one of the better bands still playing today. If you love Trower/Hendrix/Travers/Zeppelin/Cream then your gonna dig these guys big time, as a matter of fact, once you buy one of their cd's your gonna want to collect them all. Another easy 5 star release here, check it out!"
1,long hard road,"Not my kind of music, rock or blues. Vocals on some cuts is grating and band not real tight."
4,Good Book Amusing Translation,This a good book about an interesting subject. It covers the subject in a fairly general way but has a lot of information on artillery prototypes etc and is well illustrated. It certainly gave me some new information about German Artillery of the period. The transalation in some parts is hilarious. A sensor used the record barrel pressure gets referred to as 'a little bird' I think thats German humor because the sensor was egg shaped but I don't think it quite translates.But all in all agood book and well worth purchasing if you're interested in WW1.
4,Comprehensive,"This book gives an excellent insight in the matter, so one should not ask for more. There is no war without political instigation, and this is were I feel uncomfortable with the author; this book is also an apology - no Frenchman ever apologized for the Napoleonic wars, including the 1870 Franco-Prussian war. We all know live without war feels nicer!"
5,interestin concept that should have been developed futher,"Central Park Media released this on videotape around 1996 but it is actually a 1989 anime based on a novel. In Japan these novels are mostly text with a few illustrations and many anime shows are based on such novels. The concept here is ""girls who pilot a giant robot that looks like a woman."" The story is a comedy and seems aimed at a very young audience. Therefore, there is zero character development. Kazumi is the enthusiastic high school girl, Aya is overly serious prep-school girl and Mia is the reluctant leader/university student. Their job is to protect the Earth from attack by the Gedo Corporation. These aliens rely on monsters-of-the week for world conquest rather than conventional armies so the Ariel robot is the perfect counter."
4,Idiosyncratic but wonderful,"This is really a review just of the Frauenliebe: it's a beautiful interpretation, both from the singer and the pianist. Full of emotion and of course technically wonderful.My only reservations are that it's a little idiosyncratic in terms of style, and the performers play with the tempi excessively I feel. For example I find Susser Freund and Ich kann's nicht fassen, nicht glauben both too slow throughout, and Du Ring am meinem finger is completely dripping with emotion and rather cloying.However the overall effect is beautiful and certainly the final movement of the songcycle is about the most tragically emotional you will ever here - when the piano comes in at the end to reprise the theme from the beginning most people will find their eyes pricking with tears."
3,Liked it,"This rare cassette has two songs not available on CD, so I decided to buy it, being the big Petra fan that I am. The quality was okay, but I didn't expect it to be great, being a cassette from 1979."
1,"Outdated Scholarship, Misleading Information","John Matthews presents this as a source book for those wishing to be druids today. He gives the impression that this book will give you accurate information about what the druids were like. However, what he has collected is a number of essays and excerpts that tell you what antiquarians and occultists from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries *thought* druids were like. The scholarship is outdated, though it may be of interest to those studying the druidic revival as a sociological or historical event. If you are interested in learning what is truly known about the druids, rather than an imaginative depiction, I recommend Piggott's _The Druids_ or Miranda Green's _World of the Druids_. Those books provide all the essential information and direct you to other sources for further reading. For an insightful study of the image of druids through the ages, see Leslie Ellen Jones' _Druid, Shaman, Priest._"
5,great little bag,the padding is real thick and the bag's easy to carry. For forty-five bucks this bag is a good deal.
5,Short Math Wizard in Lemon Muffin Sex Shock,"This book is sometimes refreshingly witty (with plenty of scrumptious literary allusions for those lucky enough to pick up on them). It can also be refreshingly dim. It's almost obscenely colourful--Cherry Jell-O, lemon muffins, at least one seductress dressed like Ronald McDonald... It's very stylish, but touchingly honest. It's almost too real to be art. I give this project 3 stars out of 5 for typesetting but 7+ for a book that would have made Mark Twain laugh and Lord Byron wince."
2,Disappointed,"I was incredibly disappointed with this recording and shocked to find so many boasting reviews for it! The singing on the whole is dreadful. Studer is wobbly, past her prime and the same is the case with Gallo. McNair is passable, but the voice is not particularly warm or pleasant as the cute maid Susanna. The only voices that are enjoyable are Bartoli's (never heard anything I didn't like from her!) who handles the trouser role of Cherubino with bravura, and Skovhus's beautifully resonant Count. The strongest part of this recording is Abaddo's masterful conducting. However, the unpleasantness of the leads' voices make this recording a chore to get through. I recommend the Levine or Bohm recording for some of the beautiful singing and meaningful characterization."
5,objection,Methinks JW Bastian's reviews (check all three) were made to promote a website and have nothing to do with the books he is reviewing.
2,Florida Golf Course Guide,"Not bad, but with all books, a bit out of date, especially for rates and conditions. <a href=""http://www.forelinksters.com"" title=""Click here to view at Forelinksteres""> Florida Golf Courses with current ratings and reviews at Forelinksters</a>"
4,"muy bueno,","muy bueno, aunque no el mejor de sus libros, esas historias sobre colegios militares tienen su publico, y puede ser que no sea muy amante de esas lecturas, pero hay que darle sus meritos, el usa el estilo de contar las cosas comenzando desde la mitad de las mismas, yendo al principio y finalizando. no se la recomiendo a nadie como primera lectura de vargas llosa, es mejor comenzar por la casa verde, mas intensa, mas madura narrataivamente hablando,pero ustedes lo leen y despues deciden.luis mendez"
4,Try it,"Okay, so the way I read this manga is I read it in Shojo Beat, a magazine of manga being published in America. At first I refused to read it because I thought, ""Ew, volleyball? A sports story? No way, Jose!"" But then I was bored one day and decided to check it out and it was actually good! (One of the main reasons I refused to read it was because I thought the main character was too guy-like. Turns out, the person I thought was too guy-like WAS a guy... Hmmm...) But no, the main character is actually a girl and despite it being about volleyball, this is still shojo and doesn't absolutely FOCUS on volleyball action like you'd expect it to if it were shonen. The characters are still nice and the only reason I'm only giving it four stars is because the artwork is a little dodgy when it comes to faces and three-quarter profiles. But it IS a good story!"
1,It is a single user system,"I am very dissatisfied. This box has 3 separate inputs, but only a single person can use it at a time. I have multiple people on a small LAN that would like to use this system. This is a waste for the money."
2,Great product but not HD compatable out of the box,"When I buy a device that says ""HD Compatable"" on the front of the box I expect it to work with HD.When you open the box you find out you need an HD adapter sold separately."
2,"Good while workin, TERRIBLE customer service, stay away","I bought a sling box solo about a year ago, including the mobile version. Installation was ok, and worked fine, you do need a fast connection for internet viewing, which in some hotels can be slow and imagie can look cut in some times.However just before a year after, my slingbox stopped working. Now I need to pay $29.99 for customer service to tell me what is wrong with my slingbox (I know is hardware), then I would need to send it for ""repair"" paying another $80 dollars without any warranty that they can fix it, UNBELIEVABLE! I guess I should've known better that a company that offers only 90 days warranty is because they cannot stand behind their product. Great idea, amazing while it worked but at the end customer service and warranty is not worth it. STAY AWAY."
2,This WAS a good product UNTIL they encrypted it,"This was a well conceived and well executed product that offered good and reliable quality over limited bandwidth.AND THEN, the Slingbox designers decided to encrypt their video signal, making it impossible to recored what you are watching. People who use this device know what a serious drawback that is. The change was implemented with no public announcement, or explanation. Apparently they got worried that they might come under pressure from the networks if they did not add such copy protection--but there is no legal reason why one cannot record one's already paid-for shows. People have been using VCR's for years--and they offer better quality recordings than an over-the-internet recording.Unless and until Slinbox fixes this, I would recommend one of the competitors products, like the Sony."
5,Great product!,I just bought the Slingbox Pro and installed it. This is the first Slingbox device I have purchased or used. Setup was very easy and this thing was running great in no time flat. I used the Slingbox brand outlet router thingies. They work great as well and were easy to setup. I even downloaded the slingbox mobile player for my wifes Motorola Q and she can now view our tv from her mobile phone! We have it connected to our DVR unit and now she can view her saved showed whenever and wherever she wants. She travels a lot for work so this makes her very happy! Very happy.
1,Pretty good,"You have to be prepared for a lengthy setup process, but once finished it works pretty well. Only problem is that you need a very fast connection and even then the video quality will be iffy. I'd hoped to be able to hook the laptop up to a tv in a hotel room, but the quality definitely is not that good -- even in full-screen mode on a laptop it will be blurry."
2,Not for all users,"This is a great product if your a real TV lover. It works well if you want to connect your computer or laptop to your cable TV. The Slingbox PRO only HD box works ONLY if you buy this extra part that would connect to your HD cable box.Just one thing, if you want to connect this wirelessly to your portable phone. Make sure you read the fine line. It doesn't work on some of the OS out there. It's doesn't work on the BlackBerry type phones."
4,"Unique and cool item, but did not meet expectations.","The Slingbox is a great Idea. I use it on almost a daily basis, and it has been especially useful on my last ski trip where I got to watch all my premium TV channels on my laptop 400 miles away from home.However, the quality of the picture is disappointing. When watching the slingbox remotely at about 360 kbps, I have to be at least 8-10 feet away from the screen, otherwise the picture is unbearably blurry. I use Comcast high speed internet at the slingbox location and at the receiving location and the programming frequently freezes or loses quality. It can get very annoying. However, as I said earlier it is still pretty handy and I do enjoy watching my cable when I am not at home!"
3,Worked well while it worked,"While it worked, it was fantastic. I had taken a contract position in Hawaii but kept my home back in South Carolina and had my daughter set it up so I could see the football games from back home. I used it with my Comcast DVR and couldn't have been happier with it until it broke right after the warranty ended."
2,Decent product as long as it's under warranty.,"I have had a Slingbox pro since 2007. The first Slingbox went out on me right before warranty, luckily for me. I was not so lucky the second time as the hardware failed yet again after the warranty. I called support to find out that in order to assist me I must pay the out of warranty fee. In my dealings with slingbox I have had to call them roughly 5 times, always miserable. The customer support is most certainly a call center with employees that use scripted solutions. The idea of paying extra to have an employee read the faq from their website is ludicrous. Unfortunately for me, the 250 dollar device I bought roughly 2 years ago is now unusable. Slingbox said that they would charge me 100 dollars plus shipping to replace. Forget it.All in all I have liked my slingbox, while it worked. Alas, I will not be replacing it. I will look for a company with better hardware and a more reputable support."
2,"They break it, then ask for money for support","Hello All,Here's my opinion on the slingbox pro. It was a great device for a while. It worked. The video was OK. It worked remotely on both my PC and my phone. So, that was all good.Here's the bad. Their software prompts you to update occasionally. Doing so makes you get new features - usually. However, this last time, it completely broke everything. After they do an update that breaks your connectivity, they want $29 to fix it.That has me smokin mad right now."
4,It works!,"I bought this product after extensive research. I mainly use this product to watch TV around the house on my laptop and the desktop in my home office. A tivo box, MS Media Centre, and a coxial cable are attached to it. It works! I would consider the installation to be easy, the whole thing took about an hour mainly because I have so many devices. The network is WiFi 11G. Picture quality is decent. However, I still have not tried out the HD yet. The $49 cable is just a little ridiculous. Overall, it is a well design product. I would give it 5 stars if it comes with standard HDMI."
5,sweet,"I got my Pro to allow my wife to watch her TiVo'ed shows while working out of town, and it works very nicely. I also watch from my phone (Treo) during my downtime. This a very nice product, and the installer worked well (even walked me through the necessary changes on my router). My only issue was with the ethernet-to-powerline network extender, which did not seem to want to handle the required throughput."
5,Slingbox Pro,"Easy to setup, no hassles.When I tried it under a new laptop w/ Mcafee I had to do some tweaking to get it to work, (problem w/ Mcafee not slingplayer. Quality is not stellar when slinging away from home (my connection is tested at 500k upload) but its still very viewable, nothing beats being able to access your dvr'ed shows WHEREVER!! It's actually useful when you forget to program a recording and want to do it remotely. Slinging at home (on your local network) picture quality is very good, similar to a good tv tuner card. Great for someone in the military who wants to watch their local hometown programming and/or is to cheap to pay for cable of their own (My brothers case). Slinging on a pda is actually very viewable, but the 30 bucks EXTRA!?! for the pda software is kind of extreme. (I used the thirty day trial and liked it but couldn't justify $30 more on top of over $200 for the box just to view my own hardware, thats why I returned Sony's attempt at this same thing.)"
4,Beware,"Over all this product is very nice It does work as stated as long as you have a high speed conection. BUT check to see if it's compatiable with your tv, cable box, fta receiver, etc. The on screen remote control that is used in the slingbox software did not support my equiptment. Although tech support was very fast to reach, and in enghish I must add they were very aware of incompatable remote issues. With no resolve.I had to search out a third party remote program to resolve my issue. But it did not control all the functions of my origanal remote but did the job."
5,Great Product!,The best product not really known by the crowd. Watch anything anywhere. I have a friend in Spain that can take a look at my home cable system! They have recently encrypted the stream. Sling you just provide the place shift technology let the consumer worry about copyright. The is really maturing! Sling needs to stop trying to play policeman. Just keep improving your system. Even Apple wants to drop DRM!
2,motorola moxi hd cable box,This product will NOT work with the motorola moxi hd cable box. well you can watch the one channel that the tv happens to be one . you can not change channels or any other controls with the remote on the sling. I called tech and they said they dont have the ir codes from motorola. this is very dissapointing because this is the most used box in my area by my cable provider which is charter cable. If you have this service dont waste the money. Sling says they are working on it but looking at other posts they have been for about 6 months.
4,Great Product,"As a Mac user, I anxiously awaited the release of the software that would allow me to use the Slingbox and bought my unit the day it was announced. I don't watch a lot of TV, but I love having it available when I do want to watch it. I can watch the local TV newscast, record a program on the DVR or VCR, or watch a previously recorded program when I am a thousand miles from home. Very little documentation was included with the unit, but the setup program was very good and very appreciated by this technologically-challenged individual. The picture is not sharp when played full screen, but certainly very watchable. Now, if they'll just add the capability to record onto my hard drive for viewing when away from internet connections, I'll rate it a 6!"
3,Semi-pleased,"The product works very well in my house. Unforunately, when I have tried it away from home, I have difficulty accessing netwoks."
2,"Too many bug, Too much Vaporware.","I really cannot recommend this product. When it works it is wonderful. Unfortunately, that is about 70% of the time. The rest of the time I cannot connect for some unknown issue. I suppose it is come combination of my router (configured as Sling Media directed), my ISP, my home network, and the Internet in general. The bottom line is that the product is not reliable for a computer professional such as myself. The average person does not have a chance.Checkout the online forums at slingcommunity.com before you buy. It is filled with people tearing out there hair.Further, Sling Media has been promising version 2.0 of the player software and a BlackBerry version of the software since January. 5 months later and they are still vaporware."
2,waste of money,"1. PICTURE QUALITY IS ABOUT VCR2. SET UP CONNECTIONS ARE LIMITED3. IR INTERCEPT CABLES ARE MICKEY MOUSE4. VISUALLY CHEAP LOOKING, FADED RED IN A BLACK AND GRAY ENVIRONMENT. LOOKS CHINTZY IN AN ENTERTAINMENT CENTER."
4,"Works nicely, video quality is mediocre, but depends the broadband.","Works nicely, it no hassle to install, either on PC o MacPiece of cake to configure.I did not come with the IR codes for our Satelite box, and had to hunt the forums to get it, but got it working.If your upload link is not prime quality, you are going to suffer.We use Megacable in Mexico, and they do not guarantee or support what they sell. So, best luck.Otherwise, the product works as expected.Quite impressive and usefull."
5,Perfect solution for remote viewing,"Frankly, this product is over featured for me. I was not looking for something to enable TV on Cell phone for me. I mostly work from home and was looking to have something which enabled me to watch TV while working or sometimes to watch TV in bed (without buying one). I do not own a TV (I only have a projector). So this really fit the bill.My feedback:Good quality (both picture and sound)On my home LAN consumes 2.5-3.5 kbps (kilo bits)I've tried to connect it from the public network and it worked like a breeze (enable UPnP for it)Very easy to setup.I did not figure out how it works till i bought it and configured it. For those who are curious:Its got it's own tuner (which does not let you watch paid channels like HBO etc).But this device can also be setup to sit between your cable box and TV. So it can unicast (it does not broadcast)."
4,Almost 5 Starts,"I'm petty good at hooking up electronics, but this one through me for a loop. It was like the directions missed a step. Took some help from a friend to finally get it right. Once it's hook up it's great. I bought Slingbox because I knew I was going to be recouping from surgery for several weeks in bed. Slingbox was a better option then adding extra cable outlets and a TV. One thing to remember is that Slingbox is dedicated to the TV it's set with. If I am watching on the laptop from bed and my husband change the channel from the dedicated set, my laptop channel would also change and vice a versa. Once you know the quicks, it's a great setup!"
4,Good quality on a fast computer and fast network,"I have my Slingbox Pro hooked up to my Series 1 TiVo and can get great quality over our wired network and good quality over our 802.11 pre-n WiFi. One thing to consider is that you will need a fairly fast computer in order to use the ""Enable high quality over a LAN connection"" setting on the SlingPlayer. Using a PowerMac dual G4 867 MHz with OS X Tiger is *not* fast enough.On the other hand, even without this setting checked, the picture is quite good and incredibly easy to use."
1,Rarely works,"I've had the Slingbox Pro about 6 weeks now. As has been noted, you have to shell out more money for the wireless bridge. Unacceptable. Over the past 6 weeks, I've had to contact tech support 6 times. Basically everytime I'm not home (and not on my home network) my laptop can't connect to the Box. Every week I go back home and have to re-set the entire system and reconfigure the software. Next week the problem reoccurs. So it appears that the only time it works is when I'm in front of my cablebox and TV!! Hey, great! Guess what? I'm not home right now, and of course I can't connect yet again. Do not waste your money. This thing is going up on EBay shortly.UPDATE MAY '09: I just read that Sling will be offering an iPhone App for this. They're going to charge $30.00! For software that never worked for my laptop?? $30??? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!"
3,"Great, but need to be very computer savy to add other pc's.","Initially the installation and start up was great. Plug and play, just follow window prompts. Great picture and remote is awesome.Then when I tried adding more PC's, thats where it gets really tricky and frustrating, especially if your not computer savy like myself. My remote access from my work computer is very moody, it works only half the time. The other times I get an error window and it won't work. I've chatted online with a couple of techs and they can't explain it.Then I just recently tried adding another laptop to access the slingbox, and it shows a blank black screen but no error message. I am currently still trying to play with settings, but hopefully it will start to work soon!So be prepared to go through much trouble shooting if you get one.I'd give it 5 stars but do to my frustration its getting 3 stars!"
2,"Amazing idea, but the video quality is a different story.","The functionality of the Slingbox Pro is great. It was fairly easy to set up and the help menus walked me through any questions that I had that weren't covered by their quick start guide.I thought it would be great to be able to access my cable tv through the laptop wherever I go, or at home... but due to the poor video quality, I rarely use it. Hulu is a much better alternative that's FREE.The video quality didn't meet my expectations. I have a high resolution screen on a macbook pro and mistakenly expected to see better quality video using the Slingbox Pro. The picture is fuzzy and text is not all easy to read. It's not anywhere close to DVD quality."
4,Help with Hookup,"I just wanted to know if i had a digital hd antenna w/o a cable box, because i plan on using the antenna to pick up chicago t.v broadcast signals, will this product still work?"
5,SImple,"I am pleased that this book was easy to read and understand. I have resumed exploring more reading topics in the areas of spirituality, Eastern and Western religious practices, as well as tools to use for meditation. I will continue reading items with this particular school of thought"
3,Simple...,"There's not much meat to this ""guide""; I was looking for a lot more based on the history of the authors. There are a lot of books available in the genre of ""the idiot's guide to..."" and unfortunately this book falls into that category and is not a real source for much.With the many books available that delve into the history of Taoism, notably those by Grigg and Deng Ming Dao, one quickly realizes this book needs to be a lot stronger (and bigger) to be of any real use. Although this is a great ""loaner"" for friends who are intrigued by your habits and lifestyle, if you practice any Taoist-related activities now you won't get anything from this book.Borrow it and check it out before buying!"
2,Less a practical guide than a history of Taosim.,"If you already know the history of Taoism and are looking for a more practical, modern guide, this probably isn't the right book. This book takes a much more traditional view of Taoism, teaching the reader about t'ai ch'i and other activities. Presenting Taoism more as a faith than a philosophy, it's just not what I was looking for in a more practical guide to living with balance in one's life."
2,Missing the point,"Once you start telling people how to live, the whole idea of Tao is gone. The whole point of Tao is to live, in the constant stream of life, in the way that lets you blend with the environment. You can't tell someone how to do that. There is no guide to how each person should live their life. Tao is finding the way that works for you, and the rest of the world, in harmony on your own path, no guides."
5,PERFECT FOR LOCATION,"I was thinking of something afforable, soft and easy to manage. I also need a lite I can dim without paying $500.00 like the the frezie lites. This is it. I work with dark skin,low lite . This will be perfect. I am since 1989a photgrapher and I will use this for my first videography job. See I know good lighting equiptment from doing stills. Yeh I know digital you can shoot in the dark and adjust later, well I am an artist at heart and a real craftman will get it right onthe job with good lighting and this Mini Box ispretty much all you need. Get two when you learn true creation, I am.Smith Victor - Miniature Soft Light"
4,"A frank look at Egypt's front in the ""Ramadan War""","This book answers several minor mysteries surrounding the 1973 War (for instance, why did the Egyptians stop just under the air defense umbrella? Why didn't they continue their offensive?) and also highlighted the planning and execution that went into the crossing of the Suez Canal. Far from being a desperate and unrealistic attempt to crush Israel, Shazly illustrates the thought processes that went into the war. The crossing itself was not only a realistic exercise (as the Egyptians proved) but was also an example of excellent planning and staff work. The Egyptian generals went to war with realistic goals but allowed themselves to be talked into POLITICAL objectives, with disastrous results.This book is an excellent work, well worth the effort to find a copy. It's too bad that many of the typos of the original edition were not eliminated in the 2003 edition. But, it's good history as well as a good example of military philosophy."
3,A bit outdated,"While this book has some important ideas, I found it quite outdated, and thus hard to read. Many of the views stated are sexist by current standards, and some of the theories have been discredited since the book was written. I think this book is best read with a contemporary book to indicate what has changed."
2,The Nature of Prejudice by Gordon W. Allport,"There were things that I both liked and disliked about the book. Gordon W. Allport did a good job at showing you that prejudice is in your life from the very beginning till the very end, no matter who you are. Bringing up the nature vs. nurture debate numerous times made you really think about your own experiences and how you relate to the different situations he is bringing up. At the same time, the book had a tendency to become extremely repetitive and thick to read through. I felt that it got overwhelming and notably boring many times throughout the book, but when you thought back to what you read, you were amazed at what you got out of it. I don't think I would advise anyone to read this book, unless they are planning on taking the book a very little bit at a time, then coming back and picking it up again where they left off."
2,All it takes is a little effort,These DVD's seem to be a real bargain. However I gave them as a gift at Christmas and was very embarrassed. My brother has many of the commercials on VHS and the quality is far better. Why are they selling such bad quality when it is obvious there are better masters out there. There are many complaints about the sound and with good reason. With just a little effort the sound could be improved. And I am astounded at the number of commercials that are totally out of sync. That is a very easy fix. This set is cheap... in more than one way.
3,Classic Telebumf,Interesting historical DVD - although the actual quality varies.Worth watching as a trip down memory lane.
3,a fun way to cap off an evening of watching classic TV show DVDs,"This 2-DVD set from Madacy features over 3 hours of nonstop classic commercials spanning from the 50's to the 70's. You'll have lots of fun spotting celebrities and remembering products that have long been discontinued (many for good reason!).You'll see a young Tippi Hedren in 2 commercials for ""Ivory Soap"" (the second one has her voice overdubbed); Jane Withers as beloved 'Josephine the Plumber' in several ads for ""Comet""; some cool ads for ""Camay Soap"" and a fun in-studio testing for Westinghouse washing-machines. Fans of BEWITCHED will delight in seeing Elizabeth Montgomery in a tie-in commercial for ""magical Clairol"". SEINFELD's Liz Sheridan pops up in an ad for ""Bounty"" paper towels with Nancy Walker. And there are several of the classic Mr Whipple-""Don't Squeeze the Charmin"" ads.There is a lot to enjoy in this set, and fans of classic TV will love it."
3,Lighten up!...It wasn't that bad,"I got this box set a few days back, and yes, the quality isn't very good, and living in Australia I've only heard of about half of the products shown. But even so, it's fun to watch and may I say interesting too. They could have done better,did we really need to see 6 or 7 Crest commercials in a row, and some (most) of the editing was very rough, but still, it was cheap and cheerful and I'm glad I bought it."
1,Lousy selection,"I was hoping for lots of familiar oldies from the '50s-'70s. Most of what's here are quite obscure. That may be because the company that produced this hodge-podge is Canadian. Anyway, not only is the selection thrown together, the quality of the picture is very poor, especially on the color ads. Don't waste your money; I sat through this once, and I donated it to the local library."
1,Classic Commercials,"This was a real waste of money. If I could have I would have given it minus 5 stars (- 5 ). The quality was worse than any , DVD, VHS or Beta tape I have ever seen. I ended up throwing it in the garbage , I don't have space for such poor audio and visual quality."
5,...adjust your rabbit ears...,"o.k....so, the quality isn't great, and, unless you are a fan of advertising, you probably shouldn't be watching this in the first place...but to all those complaining about sound and picture quality, grow up...you've been so spoiled by all the latest effects and production values, that you think 'star wars' looks antiquaited...but yes, there was a time when these commercials looked great, and sold products...3 channels on the philco...that's all we had, that's all we needed...and we thought it was cool...so put away your xbox, and put your mindframe back to the days of an icebox..."
2,Bad quality and lots of it,"I'm reminded of the old joke, ""the food is terrible, and the portions are large."" If that's how you see value, then here is the video equivalent. This looks like a bad computer video viewed full screen. The novelty of seeing old ads quickly wears off. There is NO narration or explanation. Just one ad after another. I'm usually a sucker for this sort of thing, but the poor quality completely interfered with my enjoyment. Worth the low price, maybe, to see the Flintstones smoking. And you sure get a lot of low quality ads!"
3,Great commercials but...,"The quality of the individual commericals varies greatly. You can tell that several of these were copied from poorly-preserved video tape, resulting in in a wash effect which makes a few of them look like they were filmed in 3-D. Still, there are some great commercials I remember and a few funny ones I don't. If you get it cheap enough it's worth it."
3,Excellent stuff for your dollar - but be aware!!!,"To be very honest, there's no reason to purchase this set unless you're looking for nostalgia or research. The idea of watching three hours of commercials isn't exactly everyone's cup of tea.The mastering is pretty poor, with most of the commercials culled from what looks like a second generation VHS tape. Although some reviewers refer to the fact that the poor quality is to be expected - they are actually missing the point. Firstly 90% of these commercials are fully available in excellent prints (if you know where to look, that is) and secondly any DVD which has been mastered from VHS tape is going to look pretty ropey!Worth the money if you know what you're getting - just don't expect 21st century digital magic to restore what are lousey copies of the commercials in the first place. The quanity, which is great, just about balances out the quality, which is poor..."
1,Disappointing,"Granted, I've only gone through 10 or 20 commercials in this collection that claims to contain over 300, but I doubt I go much further than I already have. Apparently someone owns the rights to any real good commercials of the 50s, 60s and 70s. I've watched Bing Crosby do a Ducks Unlimited piece, John Wayne to a Cancer Society segment and Fibur Mcgee of radio fame (so he tells us) do a plug for the National Association of Retired Persons. There are a lot of great commercials out there, I've yet to see one make this collection."
4,"Excellent piano, but weak orchestra...","Maybe I'm being too critical, but I'm trying find a CD that competes with the recordings by Vladimir Ashkenazy and The London Philharmonic (conducted by Sir Georg Solti).This disc falls short. While the piano parts are played extremely well, the orchestra is not prominent enough in the mix.At first I was annoyed by the slow tempos at the beginning of the finale of concertos one and three,but they are not as bad as some other versions I have.I just wish the orchestra were a little louder."
5,Inspiring,I felt inspired by the perseverence of the author. I enjoyed reading the perspective of the young children. I was moved by their journey as orphans prior to their adoption by their American parents.
2,R.Jprod.,"i enjoyed reading this book, but, however I felt like I was left with some unanswered questions, for instance. i keep on asking myself why he didn't reconciliate with kim because a day won't go by without him thinking about her. When i first saw the book i didn't want to buy it but there was something inside of me that keep teelling me to buy it, and I ain't gonna lie i'm glad i bought it"
4,A book that anyone can relate to.,"Brian Peterson takes the reader on a journey through the life of Tony Norris during his college years. This book is very interesting. Tony is faced with dealing with relationship problems and family problems. The author created real-life characters, like Kwam and Gina. Two of the funniest characters I have ever read about in a novel. I hope to read more about these characters in Peterson's next book."
1,misleading title,"The old adage of ""you can't judge a book by it's cover"" was definitely true in regards to this novel. I ASSUMED by the cover that this novel was going to be a good read and interesting. I was wrong,wrong,wrong. For me it started off slow and remained in that position. Better luck next time Mr. Peterson."
1,What was this book about?,"This was one of the most boring books I have ever laid hands on. I kept hoping for some excitement, some unexpected twist, but nothing. Like many other the cover and the title completely fooled me."
2,Shallow Babblings,"Move Over Girl was disappointingly the story of Tony Noris' garrulous account of his college escapades. The entire novel was a series of rambling insipid occurrences that were unintersting and shallow. I did enjoy the humorous dialect and dialogue, but that's not enough. The only episode with depth was when Tony journeyed home to deal with his younger brother. There was just no point to the story...no pinnacle, no denoument, and no purpose. After hours of plowing through this reckless rendition of a story, I finally just put the novel in a pile that I reserve for charity."
2,Don't Judge a book by its cover,"Never truer words have been spoken. Not having read the book, but looking at the cover, this book was picked for our bookclub reading. I am not sure what the author was trying to convey in this book. He did not resolve any of the issues that were troubling to Tony involving his brother, mother, Kim or his other relationships. Or was he trying to describe how it was to live on campus at State. With some dates this could have been a journal of Tony's junior year. Tony had some deep rooted problems that were basically ignored."
2,Very cliched and Banal- A Very easy read!,"I have not finished the book..and it's taking me a very long time. I read the first chapter on the ""chance 22"" web page and liked it. I am a little disappointed so far. Hopefully, It will get better. I want to read things a little less predictable."
3,Lots of talking... not saying much,"I wanted so much not to say something negative about this book, but once I finally got to read it...Basically this book spent too much time with this guy's introspective babbling. I kept waiting for a plot to take place, but every time you felt the book was going somewhere, once again, Tony goes off on a tangent back into another state of introspection, reminiscing, giving his musings on a certain person or topic... Which would be cool in smaller doses...I realize this is the author's first book... Next time round, more plot/action, less intropection... Practically 3/4 of the book depicted what was on Tony's mind, 1/4 depicting actions...Perhaps this *should* have been presented as a ""diary""... Or titled ""Thoughts"" or something like that... We would at least know what to expect, and approach it as such."
1,Waiting for a Plot to Develop&#65533;,"As I turned each page or started a new chapter, I kept waiting for the book to get started, and it never did. The whole book was the inner dialogue of a black kid at State University chasing girls, playing ball, and occasionally doing some homework. There was a little interaction with his ""crew"", and a little dialogue with his various one-night stands and girl friends, but no plot at all.It was only curiosity that kept me reading until the end. Is that what a black man's life is really like? Do college kids really jump into bed so indiscriminately? On page 79 in one of Tony's inner ramblings he says ""Kicking it to some girl out of convenience. That's what I think that brother Ra was doing, 'cause the girl he was talking to wasn't even all that cute."" Well, now I've opened up my mind and read some of the modern black literature, and I think I'll just skip it next time and read some real literature that engages your mind and maybe even teaches you something."
3,"It was okay, but a little slow.....","First let me begin, great title and book cover, because that is what caught my attention to pick up the book. And seeing that the author was a first timer I thought okay I'll give it a try. Well I read it, but I wont recommend it as a must read, because the author was to wordy and it may have taken him 3-4 pages to tell us the reader someething that could have been said in 1-2 pages. Excatly what was the plot or was there one? Sometimes it was hard to continue reading and it made you want to skip around in the book, which is something I dont care to do. Now I do believe in giving first time authors a second chance so when his next book comes out I will buy it, but it wont be the hardcover. In conclusion let me add that I did enjoy the ending."
2,Not a good product,It doesn't work well. It is inexpensive so I didn't return the product. Someday I will through it to trash or a yard sale table. I don't recommend it to others. It just leak air too quickly.
3,Get some exercise and fill your mattress.,"The pump itself is a pretty basic thing. The hose is decent enough to do the job. But what I did not like about this pump was the amount of time and energy it took to pump up a full sized air mattress. My son is 9 years old and has more energy than most kids. This puppy wore him out! Maybe I should have given the product another star for that. If you want a basic pump for a few weekend trips a year this is a functionally cheap pump. If you need this for a 3 week trek in Norway as I did, splurge for the battery powered models."
2,I can't use it to pump up my air bed,"I bought this hand pump for my air bed so that I can get that firm feeling. I have a battery operated pump, that does a good job at filling the bed up with air, but it can't firm up the bed without a little lung help. This pump does not have various attachments for different size intake valves, for me it's virtually useless. As far as I can tell, it can only be used for blowing up toys, or balloons (not athletic balls)."
1,Come on...!,"Oh...my...God. This is what JFK and JBK have spawned? I think it's a damned shame. Well, they say the genes skip a generation. I'd suggest reading a good biography of the fabulous Jackie O instead of this claptrap, written just to enrich the publisher. I'm sure Caroline is a lovely woman, but you'd never know it from this piece of drivel."
3,"Handy and useful, but ...","Although I am generally happy with this compendium packed with so much of America's patriotic culture and history in song, poems, stories and speeches - all in a single volume. However, it is heavily biased in favor of America's better side. America's dark side appears only in relief, why? Plus there were many glowing omissions, mostly speeches of famous Native Americans heroes.But also surely I am not unique in my criticism of Ms. Kennedy's selections of speeches, especially of not having included my own favorite selection: Frederick Douglass' speech of 1854 in Rochester, NY, ""What to the Slave is the Fourth of July?""How could the author have omitted such an important speech in favor of using instead his much lamer and much less eloquent ""If I had a Country, I should be a Patriot?"" Three Stars"
5,From Figaro to Macbeth,"Bravo, Bryn Terfel!The arias selected for his ""Opera Arias"" CD capture his versatile range, singing lighthearted as Figaro and later conveying the intensity required of Wagner. This bass-baritone is easy to listen to and even without seeing him, the listener understands the persona of the character. For these reasons, this ""Opera Arias"" CD is my personal favorite among my opera CD collection."
2,Didn't fit me,"I have some old philips that I really liked and thought these might be as good but they were not comfortable and kept slipping off, tried to bend them to fit better but no luck. I gave them to a male coworker and he likes them and would definately buy again."
4,Nice but could be a bit better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The earphones are great quality and sound good. The only issue is that they are a bit too big for my ears. Maybe my ears are small but i think i have standard size ears........ Lol But they are a nice buy, so i would recommend =]"
5,best eye moisturizer ever,This olay eye serum is the best I have ever used. It provides just enough moisture so my eyes look awake and young and wrinkle free! It's truly the best I've ever used.
3,"Good product, but didn't work like I expected","I purchased this eye serum in January and have been using it for about 3 months now. I have saggy upper eyelids so I was hoping for at least some tightening in that area. I am disappointed because I see no real results. However, I have tried lots of other brands and this works as well as the others I've tried. It is a good moisturizer for the eye area."
4,Good stuff but a bit pricey,"This eye cream has helped reduce the ""appearance"" (as they say) of wrinkles around my eyes. I did notice a difference almost immediately, and it seems to help with dark circles under my eyes too. Its just a bit pricey for such a small container, and when the cream runs low its hard to get it out of the pump."
2,Not sure if its made much of a difference...,"I've using this proactively (I'm 25), but I do have some wrinkles forming, but I don't know if this product is honestly helping me at all. I've used it for 2 weeks and haven't noticed any difference with my dark under eye circles or my wrinkles that are beginning to form (crows on sides, fine wrinkle underneath eye). I'll probably be trying another product to see if I can see a difference. Disappointing."
3,Good serum BUT,But stars off because of the packaging. There is plenty of fluid left in the container when it ceases to pump. The lid is hard to remove so it's very hard to use all the product.It works for me but I may switch to something else because it's just too hard to use when the supply is low. I'm sure there are others just as good with easier to access product.
3,Olay Regenerist Eye Lifting Serum,This is a decent eye cream but nothing special. The one thing that I find very annoying is that when the pump stops dispensing product there is at least two weeks worth of product left in the bottom of the bottle. Just remove the cap and scoop what you need with a cotton swab. Can't help but wonder if this is deliberate on the part of the company to make customers replace the product sooner! Hmmm....
2,allergic reaction,"After looking at many eye creams I stumbled upon this one. I saw good reviews on the product and also saw reviews saying that people had allergic reactions to it. I thought, ""that won't happen to me"". Well, it did happen. My eye lids had a rash and later just became really dry. There is some ingredient in this eye serum that made me hypersensitive so buyer beware."
3,Feels and smells nice,"I bought this product to replenish my other eye serum. This is my first bottle. I bought it from reading the overall good reviews.This is my 1st bottle so far, so I have limited comments on the effectiveness:1. The product is contained in a nice little travel friendly pump bottle. Makes it easier to control the amount dispensed.2. I love the silky smooth feel of the serum/cream. It glides on my skin wonderfully. It also has a great fragrant.3. As for effectiveness on wrinkle and puffiness, I have used it too short of a duration to commment. But anything is better than nothing as long as it doesn't make ur skin look/become worse, right?"
3,OK,Item arrived quickly. Product is OK. Have not noticed any changes. Do not like the pump dispenser. One never gets all the product out. Seems wasteful.
5,Great Stuff,"I need blepharoplasty to aid my peripheral vision. I have been using this product for about a year, and it greatly improves the look of the upper eyelid and (I think) helps my vision as well."
2,Not what it's cracked up to be,"I decided to try this product after seeing a favorable review for it on a morning news show. It's spendy for only .5 oz., but the reviewers claimed it did work to reduce wrinkles around the eyes. After two weeks of nightly use, I really can't tell any difference (Aveeno was my former favorite), and I was very unhappy when the bottle appeared to be empty so soon. After prying off the top, however (I had to use a pliers because it doesn't screw off), I determined that the mechanism had failed and that there was more than half of the original amount remaining. I will not buy this product again."
3,you get what you pay for,I was tired of paying $55-60 for Lancome eye cream so I thought I'd give this a try. I've been using it for a few weeks and I'm not impressed. It doesn't seem to penetrate into my skin well and I don't think it does much to diminish my fine lines. Most alarming are the dark circles that seem to be returning under my eyes. I guess you do get what you pay for with under eye creams and I'll be returning to Lancome eye cream.
5,great eye serum,My dermatologist recommends this product so I've been using it for years.The price is amazing especially on Amazon.
2,Didn't work for me,"This product did nothing for my ugly dark circles. It didn't sting my eyes though, unlike other products.Has a strong fragrance, too strong, in my personal opinion."
1,reaction,I used it for the first time last night and it made the lines underneath my eyes more noticible and I now have red spots where I put it on my eyes. Not a good way to start the new year.
2,disappointed,"This is the second ""bottle"" of Olay Regenerist Eye Serum. Since I didn't notice any difference after the first, I decided to give another one a try - thinking I may not have given it enough time. Well, have been using it faithfully each day; and, no signs of improvement. Although I like almost all of the Olay Regenerist products I use, will definitely give this one a pass in the future."
1,seems cheap? it's actually overpriced!,"I don't think this does what it claims to do. At least it did nothing for me. And the bottle is tiny like a sample. This is slightly over 10 bucks, so I thought it's pretty cheap, but now that I think about the cost-effectiveness, it is way too overpriced.I'd also say that the gold pearl in the cream serum may clog pores. I've used excellent eye creams before, and they normally tighten your skin in the eye area instantly, but this serum is way too watery to tighten your skin...All in all, I don't think this product is worth a penny. Sorry. but I'm disappointed. :("
1,worst bottle design for product,"I have used the serum for over a month now. I don't think I am in the target age range, and therefore am not seeing results. That is ok with me, as long as I am perhaps preventing deep lines or sagging.My true gripe with this product is the dispensing mechanism of the small bottle. The product is too dense, so that it sticks to the walls, instead of settling on the bottom to be pumped out.I have had to shake and pound this tiny vessel and pry it open to redistribute the product, as well as just scoop it out. The bottle is by no means empty either! I still have over half the serum in there.Badly, badly designed. I will not be buying this again for that reason. Too bad I bought a two-pack!UPDATE: I have lowered my initial 2 star review to 1 star, because I developed eczema under my eyes. The only product I was using in that area of my face was the Eye Lifting Serum. I have NEVER reacted this way to any other product before. This is definitely a product with pitfalls."
3,"Good for your eyes, but not so good for animals!","I recently began using the goodguide.com to find out just how good (or bad) the products I use are for my health, the environment and their social record. I was saddened to find that Olay is still testing on animals. I have been a vegetarian for 12+ years and I guess I have been naive to believe that I could just use products I have been using most of my life with no consequences to animals...boy was I wrong!!This eye cream works good and going through Subscribe & Save this price is unbeatable...unfortunately I will no longer be buying any Olay products because 1) they test on animals and 2) most of the ingredients in their products are ""fillers"", which have no benefits they just work to bulk up the cream."
3,Switching to another product,"I have been using Olay Eye Lifting Serum for years. I used to buy at Sam's or CVS but switched to Amazon subscribe and save because it's cheaper and convenient. Product is ok. Works better than ROC for me.However, it's hard to get everything from this bottle. The pump stops working when it's half full (or half-empty). I have to open the cap (which is very hard because it is not meant to be popped open like this) and use a q-tip to get what's left-over. Once, I used a knife to cut the bottle in half. I have ran out of patience to do this again. For this inconvenience and waste, I am trying a new product> Neutrogena which gets good reviews, and I have already placed a subscribe and save order from Amazon."
1,Sorely Disappointed in Product,"I'm not sure if a previous reviewer's theory is right, but I too received one 'Made in China' and wonder if the product is ineffective because of it. What little fine lines I had, in all seriousness, increased. Did I always have this many fine lines and the product made it more apparent? Or did the product actually cause the increase in lines? To add on, I noticed a couple tiny red bumps appear a couple weeks after using this product. I've never had red bumps appear under my eyes in my life. The red bumps disappeared after a week of not using, but flustered because the additional lines are still there and visible. Now I have to fine another product to undo (or hide) all these new fine lines I'm stuck with. Sooo sooo sooo disappointed, especially since Olay's products are very good."
2,same formula as the lotion for whole face!,"I have it on good authority that eye area serums, lotions, and creams are all gimmicks, and you are better off just using your regular moisturizer generously in your eye area. Try Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum instead!Find out how much your beauty regimen is doing for you, or possibly against you! I found Beautypedia last year, and not only are they free, but 100% of their info is backed by their own research and experimentation[...]Olay is a good brand with many many many awesome products, but dont be suckered into spending more money than you need to!"
1,allergic reaction,I love olay regenerist im 32 and its helped my skin and my adult acne has pretty much disappeared. I got this for my mom and from a few days after she started using it her eyes turned bright red; looked like she had pink eye in both eyes. She stopped using this product and her eyes went back to normal. She gave it to me to use but after looking into all the allergic reactions- i am going to toss it in the trash!!
2,Don`t like the consistency,"I have been using this for about two weeks now, and only at night. (During the day I use Olay Eye Regenerating Cream With A Touch Of Concealer, which I like very much.) The serum makes the skin feel soft, but it does not feel moisturized for some reason. Rather somehow crepy. It gives the skin around my eyes a very shiny look, and I imagine it must take some doing to make eye makeup actually look good with this shine going on. Since I only use it at night I can`t really say. I will finish the bottle, but then go back to my old ROC Retinol Correction eye cream, which I have been using for ages. I don`t have any wrinkles around my eyes, which speaks for itself I think."
3,Stella,I love the product...I've purchased it before...but the pump doesn't work. It isn't working properly. The last one I bought did......
4,Under eye wrinkle softener.,"I use a small amount under my eyes to soften the wrinkles and it lasts all day, but I do not put any powder or make up over it."
2,"Olay Regenerist Eye Lifting Serum, 0.5 Ounce","Too expensive, did not notice much of a difference, except I did not have to use the deep hydration regenerating cream in that area."
4,Works great!!!,"Love this product it keeps the eye area moisturized and I could see a difference in the firmness around the eye. Also worked great with my makeup . I have tried expensive eye creams, I'm so happy I found this it works for me and saves me money."
2,"Used product, not impressed",I bought this from a local drug store. I did not notice a difference when I put it on. I used it for a couple weeks. I did also purchase the Oil of Olay Regenerist cream. That one worked good. It really softens and makes your skin look hydrate and younger. Wrinkles are less visible.
2,"terrible, wasteful container",I found this eye cream to be only OK as compared with other total effects products which I use regularly (daily moisturizer and night cream I give 5 stars). What I really do not like is the little bottle. When the bottle stopped pumping I thought the cream had run out very quickly. It turned out there was still plenty of cream in the bottle. I had to pound the bottle on the counter to make the cream drop to the bottom so the pump pumped. That worked for a while. When it stopped pumping again and sooner than I expected I got out a serrated knife and cut open the little bottle and there was at least 1/4 to 1/3 of the cream left in the bottle. Kind of a clever way to get you to buy the cream sooner than when it really runs out. I no longer buy this cream.
1,Had an allergic reaction to this serum,"Just after a single use I woke up in the morning with red, itchy, and puffy skin around the eyes. I was diagnosed with an allergic contact dermatitis, and it took almost a week before it cleared up. Never had contact dermatitis before, will be much more carefull trying a new product."
1,HORRIBLE REACTION -- APPARENTLY COMMONPLACE,"My wife had a horrible reaction to this product -- terrible redness, tight skin, almost shell-like. She is still recovering from it after 2 and a half weeks. We investigated (too late, alas) and discovered that this product has one of the worst toxicity ratings in the entire industry -- full of chemicals that are banned from cosmetics in many countries. We discovered that there were literally hundreds of similar experiences and posts over the Internet. If we had seen those reviews first, she could have been spared much agony."
1,Be wary of ordering this product thru Amazon,"I like the product (3.5 stars by itself), but giving it one star due to condition it arrived in. Just be careful if ordering from Amazon. See the photo I attached. his is how this product arrived - missing a top and all dried out. Be sure to open the box immediately after receiving so you can return it promptly if it arrives in poor condition. I purchased this 6 weeks ago and just discovered the product looked this way. I've past the 30 day return period and may not be able to get a refund. If Amazon rectifies the issue I will update this review."
2,Olay regenerist eye serus,Sad to say but this product did not work for me. I have used it every day for a week and have not seen any difference under my eyes.
3,Olay Regenerist Eye cream,"I like the design of the container. I like the pump because one has better control when applying the cream.The cream comes out easily and does not put out more than one needs.I have sensitive eyes and have not had problems with the cream accidently getting in my eyes, if I rub my eyes.I don't really know if it really gets rid of my crow's feet but it moisturizes very well. I will order it again."
3,Under eye Help!!,"Really, I can't tell yet, I've only been using it for about a month, so I don't see any difference yet, but my under eyes aren't dry anymore..."
1,The seller did not tell the buyers the product that was made in China.,The seller did not tell the buyers the product that was made in China. I found the same product made in America sold in the department stores. Why the seller sold me the product that was made in China? How to contact the seller? Where can I complain about it?
4,solid,"this product seems to work well, the area around my eyes looks a bit more lively now than before with regular use of this product."
3,Just OK,This eye cream had good reviews so I tried it. It's nothing special but then most eye creams can't take wrinkles away anyhow. I just bought wrinkle twinkle and like it better.
4,anti-aging cream oil of olay eye serum,"The oil of olay eye serum that my wife is using is very effective. After a couple of weeks, a drastic improvement has been noted around the eye. This is a very effective product and I fully recommend this product."
2,Used for 6 months,Im 32 yrs old and used it for 6 months but didnt really see any changes. I dont know if immsupposed to use it longer or i have to be in my 40s to use this.
5,Working pretty well,"I really wanted to start taking better care of my eyes and have read that Olay products are very good. Product seems to be working pretty well - my eyes seem litter and smoother every time I use it. However, you have to use it every day to see the effects. Overall, very pleased with the product."
3,"Nothing amazing, but not bad either","The serum isn't anything special, but it's also not a bad item either. The container has a good pump (easy control on how much to pumo out)."
3,Review In Process,"I've been using the Eye Lifting Serum for about a month. I like the non-greasy formula and the ease of application. However, I have not seen noticable benefits as it mentions a complete turnaround. Perhaps I was expecting more in the eyelid and area between eye and eyebrow. I do have 'drooping' eyelids and hoped that this would firm and tighten this area with out surgery. So far, I haven't seen that kind of result, but intend to keep using for at least 12 weeks."
3,Will no longer order this product,"I had been pleased with the product in the past, but the last 2 bottles did not pump properly, so I had to pull off the top(not easy), and just scrape the cream out manually. I am going to have to try another eye lifting product that has a non-pump type package. It ends up being a waste of money."
4,Like it,"What i liked about the product is that it was really light. Its been about two weeks since i've been using it, and i have seen a little lightening of my dark circles. I am hoping long term use will help eliminate them completely."
3,Olay Regenerist Eye Serum,"I'm not sure if I'm sold on this or not. I'm usually use MaryKay products, but wanted to try this out. I've used it for a couple months now....it's ok. I'm not sure if I'm seeing a big difference or not. I think I might be, but I also just might need botox.:) It's worth trying for yourself."
2,Not Impressed,"It was easy to apply and gentle with my skin, but those are the only good things about this product. The serum did nothing to make my eyes look energetic, soft, or lessen the bags under my eyes. I went by guidelines with getting adequate amounts of sleep, drinking water, staying away from sodium etc.. no change."
4,"Lame bottle, great product","So I've been using this one for the last half a year, so that's great! And the eye cream itself is quite nice, goes on smoothly, moisturizes and absorbs well. My only complaint, like other reviewers, is the ridiculous bottle. For the last few weeks, I have had to unscrew the top in order to dig out the product at the bottle because the pump doesn't reach the bottom of the little bottle. I hope they redesign the bottle because I can see a lot of people wasting about a fifth or product at the bottle due to the poor design."
2,"Lousy packaging, ok product.","I can't say that this product has transformed my eyes, but I suppose it's not a bad product as eye creams/serums go - it seems to work ok. My beef if with the packaging. I'd been more accustomed to the little tub-shaped containers of eye cream, but thought a pump might be a good idea - boy was I wrong! It would work for a day or two and then, I'd have to pump it 30 times to get a little, tiny spit of product out! I turned the nozzle every which way, I shook it, I tried everything possible, but the pump was incredibly inconsistent (if it worked at all). Finally, I had to pop the top off - I have to dip product out with the other end of the pump - not exactly how it was designed, but that's the only way I can use this stuff!I like a product I can use without a struggle so needless to say, when this is empty I'm going to try another eye cream - don't know which yet, at this point it could be any brand, just as long as it doesn't have a pump!"
1,Allergic Reaction from a First Time User,"I have very normal skin and I've never had an allergic reaction to anything else before, but after one application it appeared that red ants had attacked the skin surrounding my eyes. It took a couple days for the skin to return to normal - Aveeno's anti-itch cream really helped. I will say that I notified the Olay company and within less than a week they had returned my purchase price without me mentioning it. So I'm impressed with the company itself, just not this product. At this point, I'm thinking my face ain't so bad. But then red, swollen and puffy wasn't any kind of improvement. Users beware!"
5,Good product,I have been using this one for a few years and have tried a few other pricier eye cream and eventually decided to stick with this one. It's not expensive and it works. No miracle but it does help my eyes look younger by lifting the eye lids.
4,Solid Performer,"Have not yet written to the DVD, but all other functions work well. As expected, I had to spend fair amount of time updating Operating System."
3,A little known event in American and Bulgarian history.,"The book is a short read about the life and abduction of Miss Stone--a middle aged spinster American missionary serving in Macedonia, a part of the then Ottoman Empire. If people knew the history of Macedonia, they would know that Albanians, Greeks, Serbs, and Bulgarians all consider this part of their ethnic lands. This is perhaps why all the other reviewers have an ax to grind in regards to who the kidnappers were. Regardless of who the kidnappers were (and they were probably some of all the ethnic groups), this story portrays the kidnapping, ransoming, and return of Miss Stone and her Bulgarian friend. The story shows how the American government and NGO reacted to the ransoming on an innocent.I put this as an average read. This is a small story that really didn't affect the American government that much. I give credit to the author for writing about a little known event."
1,terrible,"this book was terrible, like the title.this book had no point to the plot!!!!!i dont recomend this book inless youi want to fall a sleep then its a good book.the auther has other good books to ofer but not this one in perticualer.i would have liked to feed this b ook to my dogs but my parents bought the book and would have gotten mad if i did.i am very disapointed in ms.wilson. hopefully she will have some good books out very soon."
4,Fascinating Photographic History,"If Civil War photographs are as fascinating to you as to me, this topically arranged volume has hundreds of examples for your perusal, many never seen before. The short essays range in quality from the well crafted to the pedantic, depending on their author's creativity. The captions also vary widely. Some reflect the critical eye of William Frassanito, the ""photographic consultant,"" while others add little to the image and occasionally distract from it."
5,Phenomenally funny film!,"This is a really funny film. In a world where we are devoid of really good and smart comedy, this fills a real need. Well-acted and extremely well-directed from a veteran writer and director. Steven Kampmann succeeds in making us laugh once again. BACK TO SCHOOL and now BUZZKILL, it is well worth the purchase. Check out the website too...there's some excellent behind-the-scenes info: [...]. Huge fan!"
4,The Word Detective is a funny fellow!,"A collection of lively & unusual questions & answers about the lore & laws of language. From students in word disputes with professors to relatives feuding over esoteric phrases.From everyday eponyms to a Drinkers' Dictionary; from ludicrous euphemisms to animal metaphors; from bizarre figures of speech to onomatopoeic orations, this writer's humorous & twisted trains of thought not only show how a phrase was originally used & what a word meant, it will show you how much fun our language really is.A wordsmith after my own heart, Evan Morris, applies his free-roaming brain cells to not only come up with plausible answers, he makes the discovery funny! An excellent gift idea - especially for your throne room!"
4,Fun and educational!,"The Word Detective is Evan Morris' newspaper column and web site, devoted to finding out where different words and phrases originate. This book is a collection of his columns, but basically reads like a dictionary of curious sayings.Morris has a light, humorous tone, which makes reading this book a fun experience. Well, if you read through the book at one sitting, you'll probably get a bit tired of his mock replies, followed by ""just kidding, here's the real thing"". Still, I like his style.What comes to the content, the book is indeed a nice collection of strange words and phrases, explained usually in a rather satisfying way. Any etymology fans should definitely read this book, unless they've been closely following Morris' column and web site."
5,The one classical CD everyone should own.,What else can I say -- this is the one true desert island disc.
3,9/8,"The Fifth is marvelus. Played very good, one of the all-time best, but he failed in the seventh. The Allegretto is TOO fast, too rushed. Played like they have too hurry. Tempo in the second movment in the seventh syphonis is vrong for me. Buy it for the fifth, not for the seventh."
5,"Definitive Fifth, Great Seventh","The Fifth is very, very polished and sounds just like it should. What more could you say about a recording of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony? I mean, it's the Fifth Symphony! Next I'll review the Mona Lisa... I can say that this Fifth seems ""faster"" than some versions, but at the same time it feels like it has the exact right tempo. It is my favorite recording of the Fifth and probably my favorite recording of any of Beethoven's symphonies. The recording of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony is great as well, and is my second favorite recording of that piece (Guido Cantelli's ancient Seventh is my personal favorite, and obviously such comparisons are very subjective). You cannot go wrong with this album."
4,What am I missing?,"I have this recording and have tried so many times to ""get into"" the hype, but I can't ever seem to do it. Sure the tempos are good, playing impeccable, but it seems to be lacking in that last element of ""over the top"" intensity. Compare to Rene Leibowitz's most compelling account with Beecham's late Royal Philharmonic, and I think some may see what I mean."
3,5th's 4th Movement has one incredible mistake!!!!!,"Please somebody tell me I'm crazy but it seems that there's a huge mistake in the 4th movement of the 5th. It starts with the famous epic theme and keeps going smoothly. Then, in the beggining of the second minute of the movement, the music changes direction back again to the epic theme that started the movement. This epic theme should not return again until later on the piece and from that 2nd epic theme the movement runs fine until the end without any further mistakes. But, again, the epic theme is repeated 3 times and the movement ends up lasting more then 11 minutes against a regular 8 minutes and something because of this extra music.Am I the only one who noticed that?!?! Or do I have one mistaken disk? Or am I just crazy????"
5,A must-have in your collection,"I've listened to many recordings of Beethoven's fifth, my favourite symphony of all time. To me, it is the perfect symphony; this is the perfect interpretation to go with the perfect symphony. Kleiber's interpretation is just right: electric, but never to the point where the interpretation distracts you from Beethoven's music. The VPO sound magnificent.Be aware that there are two versions: the CD and the SACD. The SACD is the latest release - it is a hydrid, allowing you to play it on normal cd players and SACD players.I first came across this recording during the top 100 symphony countdown in on ABC classic fm Australia. The recording was phenomenal: I've never heard beethoven's 5th sound like this. I HAD to buy a copy, and I wasn't disappointed."
5,A rare interpretation of Beethoven 5th Symphony,"Beethoven's masterpieces have been interpreted by many great conductors and even greater orchestras. Carlos Kleiber ahead of the Vienna Philharmonic has set a new, outstanding and quite rare opportunity to enjoy the 5th outside the Karajan/Metha and other major conductors' circle.It reminds me of Berstein's performance of the equally acclaimed Requiem of Mozart.The digital remastering did a perfect job for a 1975 recording. For sure, a collector's item I am proud to have add to my list."
1,The best recording of the 5th has a manufacturer's defect!!,"Without argument, Carlos Kleiber's 5th is the definitive recording. But the manufacturers of this CD have taken out a segment of the last movement. I find this incomprehensible and for me it ruined the joy of the symphony before that point. I have listened to the 5th literally hundreds of times, and such a defect is appalling."
2,I don't get it,"I just don't get it! I don't hear anything special in these performances. Perhaps that's because the sound is awful mid-70s DG, and I just can't hear past it.For thrilling performances in great sound, try Benjamin Zander on Telarc."
5,Classic readings of two of Beethoven's best works,"Let's be frank. There are many fine versions of both of these pieces. I have several recordings of each, including outstanding discs by von Karajan and Berlin, as well as Haitink and the Concertgebouw. The Kleiber recording, nevertheless, is very special and DG is to be commended for including both on a single disc.The performances are riveting - strong and full of energy - and the sound quality is outstanding. This is the kind of Beethoven that turns people ON to Beethoven."
4,Almost the Entire Kleiber Catalog On A Single Disc!,"Carlos doesn't conduct too many different pieces. What he does, he does well. This has been long considered one of the leading versions of the 5th (used to be all that there was on a single disc). Now coupled with the 7th, provides excellent value for the money. While not my personal favorite version of either symphony, it is a good one to have."
5,BEST VERSION OF BEETHOVEN'S FIFTH AND SEVENTH,"Carlos Kleiber's incredible mid '70s recording of Beethoven's Fifth and Seventh Symphonies is, in my opinion, the greatest recording of ANY symphonies that are currently available. Everything about the performances is perfect, from the articulation to the emotion. Nothing is spared, no shortcuts are taken, and thus Kleiber has produced the best versions of Beethoven's two most popular(and exciting) symphonies for the listener's pure enjoyment. I cannot add anything that hasn't already been said about this recording, so I'll just strongly recommend this to anybody looking to start a classical collection(anybody who already has even the smallest classical collection probably already has this album in it). Most incredible performance. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
3,Really two and a half,"I haven't listened to this performance in quite a while, but let's say I was underwhelmed when it was released, underwhelmed when I replayed it a few years later, a few years after that, and so on...As some of the other detractors have said ""I just don't get it"". Maybe it's the failure of expectations, and maybe it's the awful recorded sound. Whatever the case, I just think Kleiber drives the music far too much, doesn't let it breathe, so that you're always conscious of the fact that you're listening to a performance and not the music itself. Now, and here is the real heresy, I guess, I'm much less of a fan of the 5th, so perhaps that colors my view, but I have always adored the 7th, and rarely come across a performance that I can't abide...until this one. Oh, well."
5,Beethoven's Fifth as You've Never Heard It,"Beethoven's Fifth is music so familiar that many of us don't really hear it anymore. After the historic eight notes, we more or less of fill in the rest. But Kleiber and the Vienna Philharmonic have rendered magic here, making it fresh and new and compelling. And the interpretation of the seventh is simply spectacular."
5,Amen!,"I own recordings of the Beethoven Symphonies with Karajan/BSO, Gardiner/Orchestre revol., Rattle/VSO and Wand/NDR. I like the Gardiner very much, love the Rattle, I adore Wand (have been in all of his concerts in his last years) but after listening to THIS 5th I really can say that I have reached the culminative climax. You can hear the VSO players sitting on the edges on their chairs and playing with every bit of their body and soul. Never heard the first 4 notes so brilliantly played and conducted and it continous being most excellent from there on.Kudos and in memoriam to this great Conductor."
3,This Fifth is now Redundant - it's Hubcap Time,"I have lived with Kleiber's Fifth for over twenty years. I gritted my teeth and bought it when it was uncoupled with the Seventh. When it was released as an Original, I readily made the switch. It is a breathtaking performance of the Fifth. Its legendary status is understandable. It was never a state-of-the-art recording; the Original Image Bit Processing has optimised the sound in wait for SACD.But I doubt that I will ever listen to it again. The same comment also applies to the Karajan '63 or '77 and the Furtwangler '43.Karajan in Moscow, Vol. 1: Symphony Nos. 5 & 6- Pastoral"
1,Censored Beethoven's 5th,"This conductor must have been trying to hide the truth about Beethoven's 5th - after all, it is true that Beethoven wrote parts for Gong, Wagner Tuba, and Sousaphone for this symphony, but why are they not played??? Disgraceful."
2,Unsatisfactory audio quality,"The performance is marred by the inferior audio quality. It seems that the engineers of this CD have not adequately limited the dynamic range, with the result that the loud passages are too loud and the soft passages are too soft. I found myself constantly adjusting the volume control. I have purchased other CDs from Deutsche Grammophon (e.g., the Brahms Symphony collection) and those CDs are fine."
1,Dishonest scholarship indeed,"As someone who was incarcerated in 1956 and later, from 1967 to 1970, I consider that Benin committed an intellectual crime when he refused to mention that we, Egyptian Jewish males above the ages of 19, were incarcerated in the detention camps of Abu Zaabal and Tura. One of the detainees from Alexandria was 82 years old! I, as well as others, were personally tortured. For instance, I was forced to walk barefoot on broken glass. Another inmate was told to face the wall, and insult himself. He had to say: "" I am a coward Jew, I am a Jewish donkey"".Beinin must have known about Abu Zaabal and Tura. He wrote that he was in Egypt during that period. From the names he mentions in his book, it is clear that he talked to some of the former detainees.Israel gave me a second chance at life, and helped me recover. I believe his hatred of the Jewish state led Beinin to hide the truth."
1,...,"Joel Beinin wastes no opportunity to trash Israel, be it in the classroom, on radio or in print. This is well known in the San Francisco Bay Area. It may not be so well known outside of Northern California."
1,A false narrative,"This false history begins as a lie and ends as a lie. This book ignores 100% its subject, which is the 'dispersion of Egyptian Jewry'. Instead this book spends its time bashing Israel and then blaming the Egyptian Jews when they were rounded up, abused, tortured and jailed, for what crime? For the crime of daring to be Jewish. This book never mentions half the events that took place with Egyptian Jewry following 1948, which is sopposed to be the basis of the text. This book, because of its political hatred of Israel, abuses the history of Egyptian Jewry in order to lash Israel, a tragedy of history and a tragedy on the subject.Seth J. Frantzman"
2,Not so great,Thought they would be a mixed bag of quality and patterns. But all are sub quality and the patterns and colors are none that I would be seen in. I'm not too picky but these are pretty bad. Gave them away.
2,I am not sattisfied,"These socks are suppose to wic , but they still cause me to sweat a lot. I thought that with such a large mesh portion, they would work at alleviating sweat a lot better. Also, of the 6 pairs I received, 3 are already fraying at the edges without ever being worn by me.On top of all of that disappointment, the socks come in random patterns and not the black shown in the picture. I actually had one pair that was blue and neon green. It is very strange that color can't be chosen..."
4,"Good Quality, Good shipping, What I expected","The grabbag socks came in a relatively short amount of time, on par with most orders from amazon. Comfortable, great service"
4,Wasn't mostly white,"Basically the socks are great quality. The only complaint I have is that out of 6 pairs there were only 2 that were white. The rest were yellow, blue, and black with none to very little white on them. To me, that's not mostly white."
3,"Instructive, but limited","I purchased Advanced Studies, full well knowing that it would be a repackage of the previous excellent eponymous video.However, I was hopeful that the ""Extras"" would include more instruction, or at least updated musical interludes with new interpretations of funk, R&B;, African or Latino style drumming.Unfortunately, this is not the case. The video extras add very little to the overall original Advanced Studies.On the plus side, the chapter markings in the original video make it easier to navigate.This is still a great video, but I highly recommend that you purchase the Advanced Funk book and CD's as well. They contain a tremendous amount of rudiment work and major variations on the patterns shown on the video."
3,Not exactly what I was looking for,The 25th anniversary of the method books has some great examples but there is just too much time spent on the 'anniversary portion' for my taste. I am a bassist looking to employ some funk drum techniques ans this was not the answer. No question of Latham's playing - it is supurb but it was not a great 'learning' DVD.
1,disappointment,"I purchased this DVD, after reading the good reviews. however it is a very disappointing, the contense is not organized,ther are no notes of the exercises, and I think that it is irrelevant without the book."
4,little detail,"Materials are pretty good, easy to make up, the only thing is that the mounting ring i think is a little bit bigger so it wont fit perfectly en el flash, because of this deffect the lock of the flash wont operate."
2,DeLonghi AS1870B Convection Oven With Rotisserie,"Disappointed. Although well made, you cannot make toast in it unless you do one side at a time. There's a tray that covers the bottom where the heating coils are, so toasting can only be made from the top coils. Also, the rotisserie is almost impossible to use for chicken. Very poorly designed. The chicken constantly comes off the spit, and that's only if you were able to get it on the spit to begin with. I also don't care for the way it broils. It seems very slow and the meat comes out tough and dry. I've had a few other ovens before that did a much better job all around, although this is the first one I've had with a rotisserie."
3,Very Convenient But.................,"I am pleased with the unit except I believe that the temperature gauge is inaccurate. Unit does NOT reach temperature setting. Also I believe it does NOT reach maximum temperature under any circumstances. If you bake you may not want to deal with such inaccuracies. I was attracted to the unit because of the rotisserie and unit's size. Rotisserie easy to use but takes a LONG TIME. Size is very good, but dials stick out too far."
5,"DeLonghi AS1870B Convection Oven with Rotisserie, Black and Chrome","Product is attractive well constructed. Exterior and interior surfaces are easy to keep clean. Clean glass door makes it easy to view food. The heat settings are clear and easy to use. There are multiple options for use; rotissiere, broil, oven, convection oven. Toast can be made by broiling one side of the bread at a time. The instructions make the unit easy to operate. Timer can be adjusted easily and turned off when food has finished cooking. Excellent product."
2,Not As Expected,"I chose this oven over others because it said you could do 6 pieces of toast and had a toast darkness adjustment-NOT. I like to toast bread, roll, muffins, etc. Along with a long warmup time, if I didn't want dehydrated bread products I had to do them on Broil and for toast, turn it over. When using the BROIL Function you have to leave the DOOR partially open (and heat your kitchen). I used the rotisserie and bake function once and they worked OK. Quality of unit was pretty good for the price."
1,Disappointed,"Two certified oven thermometers confirmed what my attempted baking also told me. This is a weak, slow and very inaccurate oven with wide temperature swings. Certianly not something you would want to bake more than a tray of cookies or reheat chicken. Really poor performance. Disappointing."
2,Don't waist your money,This does not cook like the instructions say. I have tried most of the times listed in the manual and have yet to have anything done on time. Even with the convection cooking on it does nothing like the ad claims
2,Mis-Represented,"I purchased The Product To Deliver my Toast in The Morning, The Unit Doesn't Have Any Settings For Toast, You Have To Use Broil and Turn Over Your Toast After You Get Tired Of Waiting. When Used As A Rotisserie, The Spit Rod Doesn't Fit Well and IT binds when Installed In The Oven. The Lower Pan doen't Fit Well Either, It Binds And Scratches The Finish.In My Opinion The Unit Is Mis-Represented In All Aspects."
4,A Solid Performer,"Had a smaller DeLonghi toaster oven for fifteen years and was very impressed with the quality (made in Italy). Purchased the AS1870 (made in China) for its capacity and convection capabilities and have not been disappointed. The rotisserie has proven to be a real bonus, though I am not convinced that a 10 pound chicken is a possibility. The five pounders seem close to the upper limit and are beautifully caramelized, juicy and very flavorful. The convection function is brilliant as well. Also have enjoyed a DeLonghi espresso machine for nearly twelve years."
4,"Okay, not as good as the others","In the other books you could not tell what would happen next, but in this book I could predict what would happen and it would take the fun out of it. Ms. Cooney is an excellent writer, but she could have ended the story with a bit more pizzaz. I want other books about Janie to be written, but written well. The book had an excellent plot, but she didn't use it right. E mail me for any flames bout my comment."
4,im hooked,"The kidnapping is long past. Janie is relieved that life seems to be settling down but she misses her boyfriend Reeve Shields, who is away at college at Boston. As for Reeve, college life seems overwhelming; when the opportunity for fame in a late-night gig at the school radio station proves irresistible, he finds himself spilling Janie's story over the airwaves. Reeve is so sure Janie will never discover what's making his broadcast such a hit that he doesn't stop himself."
1,"Turn off the radio, it's amateur hour","This is one of the worst books I've ever read. A boyfriend betrays his girlfriend and tells the story of her childhood kidnapping and her problems of now having two families. She finds out and gets upset. That's it. That's the whole story. Nothing else happens. There's no revenge, no blackmail, no tragic warning, the boy friend doesn't get his comeuppance, there's no crime ring smashed, no serial kidnapper trying to kill the boy. Nothing! There's not even a real ending. This is the worst book I've ever read. How did it get published?I suppose what this book does do is give inspiration to others that even if you can't write there is some company who will publish your work."
4,Betrayal is on the air...,"After having read the two books leading up to The Voice on the Radio, The Face on the Milk Carton and Whatever Happened to Janie, I am still eager for more of Caroline B. Cooney's Janie Series! Each book is better than the one before! As ""Voice of Youth Advocates"" says Voice on the Radio is ""a real page-turner"" the book lives up to its multi-genre quality of mystery, romance, and drama including many climaxes in the story. These numerous moments of intesity get my heart pounding and my eyes opened wide. Just when you think poor Janie Johnson has found time to breathe, betrayal from a loved one catches her off-gaurd. Fortunately, Janie Johnson or ""Jennie Spring"" has two loving families to help her through it all, but how much can her families take? Sooner or later Janie will have no where to run to or a place to hide..."
4,The voice on the Radio,"Have you ever been betrayed by your best friend or boyfriend and felt like you could never forgive them? Well, this book is all about how Janie's boyfriend went to college to become a DJ for a radio station.As time went on Janie's boyfriend started something that would make Janie very mad if she found out what exactly he was doing. He kept up the same thing and never thought she would figure it out, until she did.I liked this book because it kept you on the edge of your seat most of the time and it gives good detail about everything. This book is very interesting and will make you want to read the rest of the book in the series!"
4,Great exercise on ethics for a young mind,"I picked this up at the library on a whim. It is nicely written, and i like the fact that conflicting emotions are well-explained. For example, how Janey and her sister Jody interact, the feelings that Jody has for Janey, how she loves her and hates her at the same time, how understanding Brian and Jody are of their mother's fears and weariness, and how at the same time are struggling with their own sense of independence, how Reeve feels torn between loyalty and his drive for success...All these topics are great fodder for a young mind. A good read, over all."
4,"Not Really a mystery Story, but one of Love","This book is really mostly about Reeve and Janie. And how Reeve sold her on air. I never thought that Reeve would be so soft, yet un trustworthy. Reeve thought of it like he had raped Janie on the Radio. It's not as suspencful as the first and second book, but it is, still a page turner. It just makes you want to know what will happen to Reeve, and what Janie will do to him. :)"
3,It was an OK book!,"I think this book was OK, not the best but not the worst either. I didn't like how it ended, and some of it was kind of boring. I think that it could have had a better conclusion to 'The Face on the Milk Carton', if the book just didn't end and had more to it, I think it would've been better. I really liked the other two books, and this one was just alright."
4,"The ""Perfect Couple"" Torn Apart.","You thought the end was near and that nothing more could go wrong in Janie's life.That was the wrong thesis.Reve went off to college where he would start a new hobby,to be the voice on the radio. It was the night he would fist jock, and instead of having a rythem and smooth beat to his voice he froze without having one thing to say. With all of the chaos gathered inside his mind, he thought of one story he could tell on the air.Janie was head of heals over Reve. She was even making wedding plans for the future with Reve in mind for the groom, and her the bride. Would she ever dream that something would ruine this? Well, something did.To know what ruined the ""perfect couple"" you will have to read the third pice of the Janie's life novel.""The Voice On The Radio""."
2,This was practically the worst book in the world,"This book was horrible. It had no details in it to make the story seem real. It was only a book about a girl who got betrayed by her boyfriend. This is nothing compared to her first experiences in the first two books. She found out that she was kidnapped when she was three years old from a woman who belonged to a cult. This book only tells about what happened afterwards, which is really boring. I bet other readers who read the first two books think this also. No one should read this book. It did not deserve to be published!"
4,Great book,"Janie Johnson is finally learning to live with the fact that she is kidnapped. She is starting to enjoy her life until she founds out Reeve, her boyfriend, is broadcasting her story to the world for publicity. This is a great book, and it was a good idea for a continuation, but I agree with lots of the other reveiwers. It had a weak ending. That's the reason why I rated it 7 instead of 10."
3,"Great, but disappointing","When I first initiated to read this novel, I was ecstatic and curious to discover what was to happen next. But unfortunately, when I came to the end, I was incredibly DISAPPOINTED. I did not enjoy the end of the book. It's okay if you want to waste your time."
2,Not worth the money,I found this series very cliche and repetitive. The writing was bland and unspectacular. Definitely not worth my seven dollars.
4,The book was too short!,"I have loved this series, but this book was not as good as the first two. It could have been much more in depth and the ending was so abrupt. I wish Caroline Cooney would write yet a 4th book - either a prequel to tell Hannah's story, or a continuation of Janie's story. Is she really going to forgive Reeve's betrayal, or move on with her life? She still has so many fears to deal with it would be nice to see her evolve into an independent young woman. So, Caroline, if you're reading this: Please write more! I'm hooked."
2,A saccharine sweet story that makes you feel a bit too good,"I loved ""The Face on the Milk Carton."" I enjoyed ""Whatever Happened to Janie?"". I read ""The Voice on the Radio"" out of habit and curiosity, and came away rather disappointed. They say all good things must come to an end. Well, Ms. Cooney, the good in this series has definitely ended, but when will it end? The fact that Janie forgives Reeve is a giant skip in characterization, and the fact that he was perfect in the last two books really confuses me. This book had a lot of potential, and a good message, but it came out sounding borderline preachy. I'm very disappointed"
3,Sparkl1590,"I've finished reading this book. After doing a book report on it for English, I've come to the conclusion that although the entire book circled around Janie it really strayed away from the subject of Janie's kidnapping. Yes, Reeve reveals all over the radio, but that's not what tore Janie up, Reeve betrayed her trust. This was a young adult love story not a third in the Janie series. I've also read the fourth book and I don't like that either."
4,Worth-while Read!,"I thought the book was very good, although the ending wasn't too great. It didn't tell much but I guess Cooney was saving what happened for the conclusion book!"
3,Very Confusing,"The Voice On The Radio, by Caroline B. Cooney is a dramatic novel of a young girl named Jennie Springs. Her boyfriend, Reeve, goes to college where he tells everyone about Jennie's past on the radio. She wanted to forget all about it and never go back to everything her family went through.This novel is quite confussing at some points. It goes back and forth inbetween 3 different people: Jennie, Jodie, and Reeve. This book is a sequel to the book, The Face On The Milkcarton. So at times you don't know what Reeve is talking about. The way he explains it is not that great. He just starts talking and at times you don't understand what he means. The ending wasn't that great either. It's a great book to read but you have to really understand every little piece of it. You need to have read or seen the movie, The Face On The Milkcarton."
2,The boaring Voice,"""The Voice on the Radio"" is about this girl Janie who decides to visit her boyfriend Reve at college. Only to find out that he has a broadcasting job for his college radio station. Reve has been talking about what happened to Janie as a child; and he thinks that she won't find out.Firstly The book was pretty boaring. I didn't like the way that the author kept skipping back and fourth from janie to Reve. I personally thought that Reve's parts were more interesting than Janie's because he was the one talking to people on the radio and living at college. Janie would talk about the future or to her friends wich were boaring.""The Voice on the Radio"" is a sequel to ""The Face on the Milk Carton"". In my opinion the first book was better. It was more exciting. So I would have to say that I realy Didn't like ""The Voice on the Radio""."
5,One of the best albums of classical music ever!,"Anne-Sophie Mutter is the most brilliant violinist that I have ever heard, and this is her absolute best collection of music. Every song, especially Legende, is beautifully done. Get this! It will improve your love of classical music!"
2,Slow paced & predictable,"****Spoilers in review****As another reviewer said it borrows heavily from Jumanji & Final Destination. It really lacks the pacing & drama of Final Destination though. I found myself bored about 1/2 way through. I never really cared about the characters. I don't think they were developed well enough or something. Then we get to the riddle made famous in Labyrinth. My brother then quoted what the guy should've wished for & he did minus the never to happen again part hence we end up in a Star Trek ""loop"". Once you've seen enough of this stuff this just falls flat & if you haven't seen the other things mentions, go watch them instead. I watched it mostly cause I like Eliza Dushku & she wasn't really a big enough part to save it although the ""end"" scene with her was kind of hot.Worth a rental at best but I'd say skip it."
4,IT HELPS.,"SUFFER FROM SOME KIND OF ALLERGY SO RUNNY NOSE AND ITCHY EYES. THIS NASAL SPRAY DOES SEEM TO HELP. IT ISN'T A CURE, IT'S A COMFORT. I'LL ORDER AGAIN."
1,DOES NOT WORK,I would not recommend this product. Burns as you spray the item in nose. Have used numerous products of this kins and this is the worst.
2,Good Product But...,"My wife has used Grapefruit Seed extract by Nutribiotic for years. It works well for clearing the sinus. This is a very good price. However, Amazon will not sell it to us, even if we pay a shipping charge. So don't get your hopes up."
1,Don't go there girlfriend,"Ixnay on the aspray. Sorry hommie but this product took me nowhere in a hurry. Instead try the ""Sinus Clear"" Capsules made by Ridgecrest Herbals. I took one of them and as soon as the stuff cleared my stomach, something went click inside of me and I knew I would never suffer the nasal bummer ever again. That's a fact Jack!"
2,wasn't good for me,"Well, there's probably nothing wrong with this product but it wasn't good for me. My sinuses swelled up and didn't come down for a good long time. Threw it out and moved on. You just never know until you try something."
2,Second review - less impressed,"This was my second purchase of this product and is my second review. I really liked it the first time around, but have since decided otherwise. It still burns a lot and the drain is terrible. It makes my nose run right after I use it, but doesn't really do anything to keep my head clear hours later. I won't be reordering this time."
1,No Good,"I think these are probably the worst knives I have ever owned. As far as cutting they work ok, but they RUST very quickly."
1,More of a Toy than an Instrument,Like a lot of these drum kits for kids this is more of a toy than an instrument. The hi-hat is basically unusable and drummers understand the importance of the hi-hat. With no real hi-hat or ride cymbal kids can't play a groove.
1,self centered,She sounds like a spoiled self-centered person. She had wealth comfort and in general much better than most people. She speaks of her failed engagement in the same way as other people suffered through World War Two. She used men her whole life and almost always got what she wanted. I was not impressed with her. She came across shallow and vain.
4,"Solid product, adhesive could be better..","I ordered a couple hundred of these to send out copies of our wedding video and all in all they worked very well. They are VERY sturdy, even moreso than they look in the pictures.. We did not have a single crushed disc in the mail.My only complaint is that the adhesive used is not the strongest.. In about 3-5% of the mailers, I had to go back and really press down (put a book on top) to get the adhesive to really grab hold and stay that way. That's a bad thing when you are talking about mailing. Sure, I could have just looped some packaging tape around the edges, but that sort of defeats the point.Were they to go back to the drawing board and just make the adhesive a bit stronger, this would be a no-brainer 5 star item."
4,A great trip Back In Time,"If you're in the need to go back in time, this is the DVD for you. Yes, I'm a big Huey fan so I'll disclose that anything he does is good to me. But, if you already purchased Huey Lewis & The News - Rockpalast Live, you wont want this, as it is the same concert."
2,Out of sync,"With my copy of this DVD, the video and audio were out of sync: the picture was a microsecond behind the music. The delay was sufficient to make it unwatchable. I don't know whether this defect is peculiar to the copy I received or exists in all copies, but buyer beware."
3,Huey Lewis DVD was pretty shotty,I expected a much better production here. This concert was recorded in extremely poor high school media department quality. I really enjoy live concert performances and this was an extremely difficult one to watch. Also the playlist was not that great either. I have seen Huey live a couple of times and this could not have been one of their all-time great performances.
3,"Interesting, but not ""intriguing""","This book is an interesting and in-depth look at nude photography from 1855 until 1996. Each photograph has a page-long narrative about both the photograph and the photographer. Many of the photographs are accompanied by appropriate but unrelated quotes that add to understanding of the picture. Though this book was quite interesting and I believe a MUST for anyone studying photography in general, nude photography specifically, it's not as intriguing as I'd ordinarily like. I don't find that I'm as drawn into the pictures as I am with some books of photography, such as Nan Goldin's _Ballad of Sexual Dependency_. In spite of the lack of intrigue, this is still a well-done and interesting book, and certainly a perfect gift for anyone interested in photography."
4,Belkin PureAV Remote TV,"Excellent reception. No picture ""noise"" or interference 40 feet from signal source. Color quality is not the same as if connected directly to the signal source but still not bad.My overall satisfaction with the product is high. I look forward to the day when Belkin produces a wireless remote High Def signal."
5,Amazing Symphony,"This is a great performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, which he completed in 1824. The Ninth is one of the most famous symphonies ever written. It is an amazing classical work. The first movement is very stormy at times and is my favorite. The final movements choral section is most popular. The Caroline Overture, which is also on here, is from 1807 and is a very good work."
4,A great work done well,"Most of my life I have listened to and enjoyed Classical music. My teenage son has a deep appreciation for it as well. I am not a professional reviewer, but when I stumbled onto this recording it brought back memories that can still be stirred by a fine recording. Due to it's source recording being almost 30 years old there is a lack of crispness I have grown to appreciate that CD's bring out. This re release however still offers the magic that only a great composer and conductor can bring to the ear. There is no other way to explain it."
5,"Karajan and Beethoven, together for eternity.","As an avid collector of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, this recording is among my top few. While Solti's 1972 recording remains my absolute favourite, the great Karajan effortlessly scales the great mountain that is Beethoven's Ninth.The finale can be desrcibed with a single word: ""Freude!"" The tempos may be a little quicker, but the soloists are incredible and the Berliners contribute with a raw power of sound that can only be directed by a man such as Karajan.For years to come this recording will continue to be lauded as among the best."
5,exellent vocalists,"There have been many excellent recordings of the ninth, this recording is unique in its choice of soloists especially the creamy upper notes of gundula janowitz no trace of hardness is visible in contrast with her other rivals.The other soloists are also exeptionally well,which makes the acquisition of this CD a must"
5,Great sandals!,Newport H2 Full Sandal -Ladies They are perfect for hiking and very comfortable. I didn't have any trouble wearing them right out of the box. Very good price too. I saved at least $45 buying them from Amazon.com
5,excellent,"arrived on time, perfect fit, love my keens. I have had keens before and adore wearing them - they are the most comfortable shoes ever!"
4,Not quite the same as the original Newport,"I'm a little disappointed. The first model of this sandle was better made with more comfortable, neoprene across the back, rather than just a thin strip. Also the sole seems more rigid and less comfortable. My feet were in heaven with the original Newports now their just OK."
1,keen,I had to send them back 2 times because the sizing isn't correct. I had a pair preaviously that were the same size and fit fine. I is like these were made in China.
5,Wish I could give this ten stars!,"In water and on land, this sandal never stops performing! It's cute AND functional... what more do you need? I walk a lot of dogs in coastal Maine and am constantly splashing through puddles in the woods, through mud and over rocks and wading through the surf at the beach. This sandal does it all, and does it comfortably, without rubbing or irritating my feet. I am so impressed with the quality of this shoe. I even wear it to work in a retail setting because it has amazing arch support for my high arches. This is the ONLY sandal I can wear and not have pain in my feet and knees at the end of the day! I would recommend this product and brand over and over; thank you, Keen, for your ingenuity!"
3,Great Fit Poor Traction,"I found these shoes on sale at the local Cabellas and decided to give them a try. I love how they fit my feet! I have an extra wide foot and the shoe fabric stretched accordingly to accomodate (I am size 6.5 D-E). I brought these to costa rica for two days of whitewater rafting, a day of canyoning and more recently on some kayaking adventures. As great as the fit is however I found these shoes to not provide much traction on wet rocks. Granted, most shoes fail in this category but as water shoes I expected the keens to perform better. I would have been better off in sneakers. I wouldn't recommend these if you will be moving around on, hiking or climbing wet rocks and need good traction."
4,2nd pair. Love them!,"These are my second pair. I wore out the first ones. It took me 4 years to do it, but they are definitely worth the money."
5,Most amazing shoe ever,"I bought these shoes about a month ago, since I've had them I have hiked, walked, and even ran in them! They are the most comfortable pair of shoes I have ever owned and even through wearing them all day outside, feet sweating, they keep your feet smelling fabulous. Yes, they look kinda funny, but who cares when you're comfy!"
4,Keen Women's Newport H2 Water Shoe,"I like the shoes and they are bright and sturdy, but I find them a little bit too heavy for me because of my age and weakness in my legs and feet, but I still use them!"
1,I thought Newport meant sailing.,"two months on foredeck they were sliding all over the foredeck.sailing shoes they are not.they sit in the cupboard but may use for walking the dog: except the stitching has gone. And they looked so cool! ShoddyAnd I had to change them three times: womans>man, wrong size>right."
4,Newport H2 Keens,I love the color and found the shoe to be very comfortable. I have a bunions and it didn't bother it at all. I have very hot feet and found the shoe made my feet sweat...maybe the more open Keen would be better for hot feet.
4,"Very functional, just ugly","Bought these for a Costa Rica vacation. Serve their purpose, I will use them for summer sporting activities, but they're not flattering and never will be."
5,These sandals are THE BEST!!!,"Keen makes the MOST comfortable sandals on the market. They fit beautifully, last forever, and they look pretty, too. I love the color purple and when I saw this new color for spring, I had to have them. They can be worn for literally any activity and are highly recommended. This is the 4th pair of Keen sandals that I have purchased because I adore them so!"
5,All odors from the fridge are gone.,"We've had this in our refrigerator for about three months now. As far as it making food last longer, the bagged lettuce and meats do seem to last longer. I don't know how much, but longer. The big thing we've noticed is no more smells. You know how sometimes you will open or cook something like chicken, tuna or onions and even though you put them in a zip lock bag or Tupperware the smell will take over. This just doesn't happen anymore. We couldn't be happier.Tip: Keep the instructions so you know what the LED is telling you and the proper way to change the batteries."
5,great romance,this is a great series and the seller had it here I think before he got the order and that is fast
4,A good read,"A good book for those who are into history, which I am. Those who will not learn from history, you know the rest."
1,Learn To Embrace Silence,"I bought these ear buds as a replacement for my iPod in an airport where there was no selection, but I still regret buying them. They are extremely uncomfortable, and seem slightly larger than other ear buds. This means that not only do the foam pads slip off every time you take them off, but that they never really seat correctly in your ear, rendering them utterly useless for any kind of physical activity. I tried them on a treadmill, but got so frustrated with putting them back in every few seconds (literally) that I took them off and ran in silence for the next half hour. As soon as I got home from my trip I bought a pair of Sony ear buds, which I highly recommend.The sound quality is not great either, but that will be the least of your worries when you are trying to use these. I would avoid these ear buds at any cost, despite the appealing price."
3,good book,"just seems like it was for a younger generations...so wish I had it when it first came out..Dyer interests me, so had to check it out :) did love the chapter about procrastination tho :)"
3,Containing too many misprints.,"Unfortunately, the 3rd edition of Mahan's book contains enormous number of misprints. Sometimes, it is impossible to understand what is meant by the author without consulting the previous edition. For example, in Sec. 4.1.5. the author refers in the text to the equation which apparently should be between Eqs. (4.126) and (4.127) but which had been omitted. At the same time, some evident drawbacks of the previous edition have not been corrected. For example, the definition of the thermodynamic average used in Sec. 3.6 is different from that used in the previous sections, although it is not mentioned in the text. Despite the book is an excellent introduction into the field of Many-Particle Physics, I would recommend to the customer to either buy the previous edition or to wait for a new one."
3,"Gentle, mystic music","This selection of music was the perfect choice for an 'Enchanted Kingdom' theme. If you have ever heard the Fire Bird by Igor Stravinsky (and if you are looking into classical pieces such as this, you probaly have), this music is very similar in mood. The actual Enchanted Kingdom piece was very mysterious and enchanting, for lack of a better word. It almost resembles the opening to the Firebird. The Distant Princess, also by Tcherepnin, resembles the love scene in Firebird just slightly longer and more involved. Baba-Yaga is another wonderful 'action-packed' piece much like the the music right before Infernal Dance in Firebird. Overall, I enjoyed this CD and found it to be average among my collection. The cover is nice too. A drawing of a castle in a mid 1400s style is displayed."
3,A Restrained Approach,"I found this to be a frustrating recording - delightful in it's attention to the ""quirkier"" details of Holst's popular war horse (Saturn, for example); disapointing for the surprisingly perfunctory treatment of portions more conventional in structure (Jupiter, Mars), but nonetheless requiring a more romantic, emphatic approach. An intellectual's interpretation that is only partially effective."
3,"Measured, antithetical","This is an almost perversely analytical approach to The Planets, which is, after all, a great mystical work by one of music's great mystics. I don't mean to damn the effort--it reveals or (perhaps) doesn't distract from the compositional structure and orchestral details--but it is more like photograph of the character than the character himself. For a powerful, fully realized multi-dimensional incarnation try Levine on DG."
4,tanksitsok,This item arrived in perfect condition and on time as has been the usual with Amazon products. It was determined to be correct for installation before ordering and was. Reason for only four stars. Caution! Before forcing the electric connection plug you may have to remove the molded key notch adjacent to the contacts in the tank receptacle with an exacto knife in order to allow the car electrical connector to plug into this tank. This item has functioned properly since installation and very happy to resolve problem with old tank that was replaced.
3,needs to be updated,I thought it would be updated. I bought the same thing 11 years ago. Permanent Parisians James Morrison's grave has been changed twice since then. Maupassant's has changed.
3,A little too virtuosic and stylized,"There are better recordings out there, you may want to try Szell or Abbado(digital). I expected a lot from this album and was disappointed. Some of the slow parts are too slow, and some of the fast parts are too fast. They delight in virtuosity to the point of hurting the music. Overall a good recording, but one that did not need to be in the Deutsche Grammophon Originals series, which is usually pretty reliable. While this set seems attractive because it picks out the better dances from both Brahms and Dvorak and puts them on one disc, serious listeners may want to look elsewhere. Besides, this CD leaves out one of the dances that Brahms himself orchestrated."
2,Why? You could have the Dorati!,There's really not much more to say. The Dorati with the LSO on Mercury Living Presence has this one beat by a very long distance. (I don't hear much sympathy on this recording for things Hungarian.)
4,Recoup is on the works,"Leave on for two minutes and then rinse. I like it because it does not leave my hair a waxy silky feel after rinsing. It rinses off making my hair feeling like my own natural and it works. Makes my natural curls look healthy and full. I will continue to purchase this product. The only not so good part for me is that, it does not have a rich fragrant smell, but it is acceptable. Good for hypo-allergenic people."
3,A-Z of Perennials,"This book had very nice pictures. Wonderful pictures of flowers in bloom and/or foliage. It briefly listed size, color, time of bloom, and sun/shade preferences, and then went into explanation at the bottom. I found that helpful for a quick reference on the details of a plant. The author could have listed other details though. Such as, the soil preference,etc. When comparing it to other books, I found that some plant specifications were not accurate, although this book had some nice plants listed that others did not even have. Overall, this book is a helpful book for the gardener or for a landscaper to use a picture book for customers."
3,"animation parts are fun, live action puts you to sleep","I know there are a lot of people who love this movie. I personally enjoyed all the talented people who lent their voices to the animated characters. And sure, the DVD image is as flawless as a new release print can be. Yet the combination of several Anderson Fairy Tales and poorly written live action dialogue connecting all the animation left me wishing that about 15 minutes had been trimmed. The story of a real boy who learns about how to become an unselfish person is basically a good one and he meets lots of interesting animated characters along the way, but some actors are wasted (Ray Bolger & Margaret Hamilton). It feels like the producers had access to these people and tried any way they could to fit them into the production, unfortunately at the expense of good pacing. If you are a Rankin/Bass completist, then pick this up, you won't be disappointed. Otherwise for most of us it will make a decent rental."
5,Fond Memories,This takes me back to when I was a kid. I always enjoyed the Rankin & Bass shows.I didn't remember this until I watched it with my niece.The Rankin & Bass Christmas shows are on yearly so they are more easily remembered. It is a cute way to watch the Hans Christain Anderson tales.
4,Fabulous!!!,"What can I say? This is a wonderful movie for both kids and adults- lots of famous stars, well-known tales from Hans Christen Anderson, and that wonderful animation from Rankin-Bass. A clean, wholesome movie from 40 years ago, that still manages to entertain!"
4,The Daydreamer:An Enchanting Family Treasure,"This film is a fictional account of Hans Christian Anderson life. It switches between the life action adventures of Anderson as a young man and the stop motion segment of Anderson's stories. This is terrific introduction to the stories of Hans Christian Anderson. Although the stop-motion animation may look outdated in comparsion to computer generated effect of today, it is a refreshing change from today's rough animation that dominates television today. This movie is geared towards children; however the plot is so engaging and the music is so charming that adults will have no promblem sitting through this with their childrens."
5,Filmed through an amazing combination of live-action and stop-motion animation,"The Daydreamer is a children's DVD movie filmed through an amazing combination of live-action and stop-motion animation. Adapting some of Hans Christian Andersen's most famous fairytales, The Daydreamer follows a young Andersen as he imagines his fables come to life. The adapted classic Andersen fairytales include ""The Little Mermaid"", ""The Emperor's New Clothes"", and ""Thumbelina"". A commemorative booklet, still gallery, and poster round out this delightful DVD sure to entertain kids and adults alike, starring the voices of such well-known personalities as Boris Karloff, Patty Duke, Robert Goulet and more. 99 minutes, closed-captioned, full frame presentation."
3,Not a great implementation of a good idea,"The concept is good. The beam of light is actually very helpful when running in the dark. However it's not implemented well. It's way too large, too heavy, and unlike the usual ""pull through"" strip of velcro for sizing at the back of most caps they cheaped out and used just two little strips that overlap -- making it very hard to size appropriate and almost impossible to resize when running w/o stopping.PROSSturdy fabric and constructionEasy to turn on and offLight beams are bright enoughCONSWay to large -- will only fit the largest heedsDense fabric makes the hat very heavy to wear (NOT for summer)Cheap velcro ties at back are difficult to use."
2,I use this hat with lights for jogging in the dark,"First off, the hat I received is not as pictured on Amazon. The lights are underneath the bill of the hat, about half way between the front edge and the headband. The picture on Amazon's web site shows the lights on the front edge of the bill. This didn't seem to be an issue when I received the hat but when I used it I found out that this change is not desirable. The reason is because the underside of the bill illuminates slightly, creating a glair and makes it harder to see. Other than this, the hat is great for jogging in the dark. It creates just enough light to see where you're stepping while the bill of the hat can block light from oncoming cars. The battery life must be incredible. When I opened the package, the light was on from at least the day before! If the lights were on the front edge of the bill, this hat would be perfect! Oh well, maybe I can return it. :("
5,good,i bought these socks to go with my touch up thong shoes with the 2.5 inch heals the shoes i love but with the heals makes my toes hurt with the thong style design something to do with gravaty :P so anyway i bought these socks to wear with the shoes for a wedding the shoes feel fine if sitting but standing and walking kills your big toe and middle toe and with the socks even tho it doesnt clear all the pressure its sure does soften it up so you can stand it better the sock are really cumfy too. I just got the socks and tryed them with the shoes and i could instantly tell the difference. will work wounders at the dinner and dance after the wedding next weekend. and if bride complains i will tell her to stuff it. lol the life of being nice to someone you dont really like :)
3,mishmash of speculations and fantasies,"The book contains lot of controverial UFO theories (MJ-12, underground bases, etc), general new age stuff, occult roots of nazi movments, etc. The content stands more or less on the basis of belief, there is no in depth analysis. Right in the beginning it presents an obvious fake picture of three ufos implying it is a genuine radar photo, from there on I did not take the book seriously. I actually read it only partially, skipping here and there."
4,Outstanding Mass Recordings,"These are all very theatrical mass settings, quasi operatic. In my opinion they are a risky deviation of the traditional mass setting, but the genius of Bruckner makes it work. Definitely not for all tastes. The recording is top notch, and the choir singing is often breathtaking. This is a truly outstanding set to have. 4 and a half stars"
3,The USA IS responsible for the creation of the Taliban and 911,"You are obviously not educated, or educated by fox news if you are bashing this book because it blames the USA for creating the Taliban and then the 911 attacks.Your problem is no knowledge- the USA CIA DID CREATE THE TALIBAN.USA is complicit in a number of events and in some cases directly funded the people that were responsible for 911.The rest of the info is hidden and destroyed under the false pretense of national security or we could show so many facts that it could even be spoon fed to you by fox news and the republican sugar coating would still let the taste of the truth seep through.I highly suggest you read more books on this topic- maybe you will realize after a while that we had a war by proxy with russia via the taliban, our good friends who we handpicked from Pakistan- they weren't even Afghanis!!"
1,What happened to CHILTON,"I must say that of all the books that I've read from Chilton, this has got to be a serious joke. Those of us who buy these books buy them so we can learn the material. The way this one was written, it seems almost as if you wrote it for people who already know these things. I'm very disappointed in this book and hope that a revised edition will be published. Please make Chilton #1 once again. Sincerly, Jeff Wynberg, concerned, loyal customer."
5,Excelent product,"I had to change my 17 month old baby to her bed, and this bedrail has been the perfect solution. Beautiful color and I can finally sleep well while she sleeps with no danger of falling."
3,Not quite what I was looking for,"I was searching for a bedrail for a toddler bed, and this is one of the items that came up. Upon reading a few of the reviews, I saw that it could easily be used for just that purpose. Unfortunately, when I received it, it states right on the box that it should not, under any circumstances, be used on a toddler bed because it requires 9"" of space between the siderail and the bedrail for the child to get out and not accidentally get lodged inbetween the two. If that had been included in the description here, I would not have purchased it. You also need to have both a box spring and mattress in order to use this bedrail (we do not), so it can't be used on platform beds either."
2,Not as pretty as it looks,The color is dark pink that doesn't match with the normal pinks we have for the kids room. Otherwise its good.
3,Run-of-the-mill,"I think these tone poems require more passion and emotion than von Karajan exhibits. I was prepared to enjoy these selections but came away disappointed. The sound was good and the notes were played, but the interpretation didn't reach me emotionally. Les Preludes crashed away at me and the Hungarian Rhapsody seemed unduly lethargic. The Smetana pieces also had a paint-by-the-numbers feel. It felt like van Karajan was holding something back even as the orchestra played on."
2,ruined by sound engineering,This is a good interpretation but the CD is ruined by the sound engineering that is over the top. The louds are much too loud and the softs too soft so that you have to constantly adjust the volume to compensate. As is the sound is nothing like a normal concert hall performance. It has been sound engineered to death by over the top engineers who think exaggeration is good. It isn't.
5,"Excellent CD, new, arrived in perfect condition","Beautiful recordings of Brahms's Piano Concertos, excellent tempo, marvellous interpretation of both conductor and pianist. Item arrived quickly, just as described, and in perfect condition. I would certainly recommed seller!"
5,a truly great recording,"To my mind neither Eugen Jochum nor Emil Gilels received the acclaim appropriate to their genius while they were living. Even now it appears they are appreciated mainly by a small clique of true classical music lovers.These two performances of Brahms' Piano Concertos are flawless. They were both recorded in 1972 when Jochum was age 69, and Gilels was 55. Two masters in their mature prime. Add to this The Berlin Philharmonic and recording by Deutsche Grammophon. This is perfect Brahms. The treatment of both concertos is equally superb, achieving a synthesis of piano and orchestra in performances of unfolding eloquence and power.In 1987 at age 85 (a year before he died) Eugen Jochum was asked in an interview about his memory of great recordings. He singled out the 1972 Brahms with Gilels as perhaps the finest recording of his career."
3,Verging on ponderous--I prefer Gilels/Reiner,"Late in his career Emil Gilels took a turn into so-called monumental playing of Beethoven and Brahms that doesn't appeal to me half as much as his earlier, more fiery self. There is a great Brahms 2nd Concerto with Gilels the younger and Fritz Reiner that, to my mind, outshines this performance in every way. I have owned the present set twice and both times I discarded it after a few hearings. If you like slow, large-scaled Brahms for these concertos, the young Barenboim made a wonderful set with Sir John Barbirolli on EMI."
5,SPLENDID and ESSENTIAL,"In short: No.1: As orchestral interpretation(Jochum-BP), only comparable with Giulini-Philharmonia and as piano playing only comparable with Arrau, Rubinstein and Curzon. Gilels' playing is romantic, powerful and splendid; Arrau's playing is philosophic, deep and deppressive; Rubinstein's playing is poetic,luminous and lively; Curzon's playing is lyric, thoughtful and elegant. No.2: Only comparable with Richter, Backhaus, Arrau and Anda.This is not-to-be-missed and essential set for Brahms lovers. Superb recording and accoustic too(Jesus Christus Kirche,Berlin-Dahlem; 1972,Stereo). One of the greatest in every point of wiew."
2,wrong movie,"The reason I gave it a two was that I got the right case but got the wrong movie. When we opened the case which was the correct one, there was an english movie Ladies in Lavendar. Since I love that movie I am keeping it. I will have to try again after Christmas for the Hans Christian Anderson one. My grandson is waiting to watch it. He is 16 and I am so happy he got into the movie when we watched it on tv. We just didn't know that it was a 2 parter. The movie came at a fast pace. Was not disapointed on that account."
1,this film may have you comit suicide.,"This film is horribly depressing. The main actor plays his character like a raving lunatic and , if he acted this way in public, would have been locked up.I was hoping this DVD would be a series of shorts, like arabian nights, or even the 10th kingdom, but no. Instead it was a thinly disguised biography of han's christian anderson. In fact the acting of the main character is so bad, you do not even want to see the fairy tales. They too are gloomy and depressive.Skip this one, and if you must get a hall mark faerie tale try the following:10th KingdomArabian nightsThe Snow QueenDinotopiaJack and the Bean Stalk the true storyMerlinIn that order.Sincerely: David C. Eberhart II"
3,Didn't fit my needs,"This hard case does what it is supposed to do -- protect the cell phone. However, the beautiful blue did not completely cover the hideous pink of my new Verizon Razr V3. I was hoping to approximate the lovely dark blue of my former Cingular Razr V3. I didn't get the silver Verizon model because the in inside is black rather than silver.Also the hard shell made the Razr much thicker."
4,Misleading Description,"One reason I purchased the import version of this album was that in the description it states ""plus the unedited version of ""The End"". This statement is not correct. The version of ""The End"" included on the import CD is NOT the unedited version. The end result was paying a $10 premium to no purpose."
5,Mother of God!!!!!,"All I have to say is ""THIS IS DANGEROUS MUSIC"" !!!! How could bands of today possibly think they can EVER be creative enough! These guys are the real deal & this DVD proves it! THE QUINTESSENTIAL of COOL!"
4,Works well,Works as described. This is second one purchased (second location). Not perfect but for price works well for most size of grapefruit although a large fruit will result in some fruit at edge usually.
4,Best Cutter for Grapefruits and large Oranges,"I've been using this for a couple of years. The best way to see how this works is to go to the Chef'n website and click on the video for the grapefruiter. It's fast and easy. I also use it for oranges so I can eat them without peeling them. I cut a section pick it up with the tool and release it into a cup. 20 seconds later I have a cup full of yummy citrus sections that I can eat with a fork. The only thing I don't like is that they don't last. I'm on my second one now as the first one went caput. Everything is hollow plastic except for the blade. And if you don't rinse the grapefruiter right after use pieces of citrus can get stuck inside the hollow plastic handle. I wish it was made sturdier so that it could last years, but I have not found anything better, cleaner or easier for cutting grapefruit."
2,No good for larger grapefruit,"Bought this on a whim, and like most things that I buy on a whim, it soon wound up in the trash. It's a great idea, but don't try to use it on anything other than rather puny grapefruit. It sure can't handle Texas sized ones. There's more waste than section."
1,"Can't give it ""no"" stars or I would","This thing is the pits. I ordered it after reading other negative reviews attributing them to operator error. Wrong. The opening is not long enough to reach from the center of the larger grapefruits to the rind so it can get the entire thing. The scoop is not deep enough to reach the bottom center, and while the mechanics work as described, I only got pieces out that meansured less than an inch in length. Two-thirds of the pulp remained in the section. I ended up returning it stating it does not perform as advertised. You're better off with the trusty grapefruit knife or grapefruit spoons."
1,chef'n grapegruit citrus sectioning tool,"SORRY, BUT THIS TOOL FAILED TO BE ABLE TO CUT OUR MORE THAN 1/3 OF EACH SECTION. WAS JUST EXCITED ABOUT THIS TOOL, SINCE I LIVE IN FLORIDA AND HAVE 2 GRAPEFRUIT TREES.B GWINNAVON PARK FL"
2,Not sure about this,"I'm not sure if it's just me, but I can't get this thing to work. I've tried various sized grapefruits and haven't been successful. I might be expecting too much from this tool."
1,Grapefruit NON Cutter,"I was extremely disappointed with this product. I saw it on TV, & hunted it down online. It cost almost as much in shipping as the purchase price, so you can imagine how unhappy I was when it didnt work. I follwed the meager instructions on the wrapper,3 pictures, big deal. I wasted quite a few grapefruits, getting nothing but juice and mush. THEN I wrote to the company's website, & have heard nothing. All in all, I spent over $16 for a product that doesnt work. I wouldnt reccommend it to anyone. By the way, apparently you cant submit a review without at least one star, but trust me, I wouldnt even give it that!"
1,"Terrible product, simply doesn't work","Surprised to see some positive reviews on this item, as it was one of the worst kitchen gadgets I've gotten. I've used citrus cutters like theOrka Grapefruit Cutterand those work pretty well, and I thought this looked like it might work similar but with less mess. Problem is, it simply does not do the job! It leaves so much grapefruit behind (when you can get it to cut a section at all) that it's hardly worth using as I have to get a knife out to scrape all the stuff it left behind. Avoid it, and just get yourself a good grapefruit knife."
1,Do not recommend.,"""Chef'n Grapefruiter Citrus Sectioning Tool"" I do not recommend this product. I watched every online video I could find to see if I was using it incorrectly, but nope. It is very cheaply made, the metal cutting part keeps bending and getting stuck, you have to pull the handles apart to get the fruit to come out. It mostly just mashes the grapefruit. Maybe it would work with a different sized grapefruit, but none of the ones I tried it on. I ordered a grapefruit knife and grapefruit spoons instead."
2,Chef'n Grapefruiter Citrus Sectioning Tool,We purchased this Chef'n Grapefruiter Citrus Sectioning Tool from Amazon before Christmas to make ambrosia. It has a faulty mechanism because one must manually move the handle back to open position each time it is squeezed to cut the fruit.
5,Phytocillin works!,"I have used Phytocillin for years. I take it orally for colds and flu and other sinus or respiratory problems, and topically as an antiseptic to prevent or cure topical infections. It works! I can't get it locally anymore so have to plan ahead and buy through Amazon."
3,great little window feeder,"I wouldn't say this feeder is as easy to fill as other reviewers, but it's not THAT bad. I assume if you are approaching the feeder from the ground floor and you can walk up to it with both hands, it wouldn't be difficult ... but returning the basket to the suction cups is really not very easy if you are leaning out a window. I always have to take one of the suction cups off the window so the basket will fit behind the ledge that holds it in place. ... and then inevitably I have to play ""is it level yet?"" so that it looks ok from inside the house. It's difficult to explain, but for ease of refilling by removing the basket, I only give it a 2 out of five stars.However the feeder has been fine besides that. It keeps the seeds relatively dry in the rain and snow, and I like that it's adjustable if we want to keep the bigger birds out."
4,Finally the birds discovered the feeder,"I love the feeder- it hangs well on the window- its not an eye sore- the suction cups are strong. It holds a nice amount of seed. ... BUT.. I have yet to see a single bird come and eat! :( I've tried a few different seeds to no avail. I'm really disappointed, but we'll keep trying. So far, its been up for 4 weeks with no luck.**Update** It has now been almost 8 months since I bought the feeder. I ended up buying another standard feeder for finches that hangs from the eaves. Within a month, flocks of birds were at the newer feeder. Then, they discovered the clear window feeder. It is great to finally see birds feeding from the window feeder. I've noticed, much larger birds come to the window feeder, than the finch feeder. They all drive our cat crazy and the kids are fascinated by the continuous stream of birds who come to socialize and feed at our front window."
2,No birds for a month!,"As the title says, no birds for a month of having this on my window with premium seed. Then late one night I went to look out my window because my neighbors were making noise, and to my surprise I see a huge cockroach sitting in there eating away. Ugh I am done with bird feeders if it is going to attract my nemesis."
3,No seal,I received this item as a gift for my wedding anniversary. Although it is a pretty set - there is no seal on the lids. Moisture gets into my sugar in the humid months and it gets hard. I am actually shopping now to replace this set so I will have sealing lids.
1,Boxset never gets completed!!,"If you are looking to complete the Vegeta Saga 2 boxset, then do not buy this product. They stopped releasing these DVDs after Volume 9. So this Vegeta Saga 2 boxset will have one DVD included, and you can buy one more DVD and that's it. There will be about 3 more DVDs that will never be released to complete this set. So people who bought this starter boxset (like me) anticipating more to come got screwed."
3,getting sick of these sagas,"Ok, I love Dragon ball series.I read the entire comicbook series when it first came out in Japan in the early 90's.What is so hard for Funimation to just label the DVD's with numbers (AND KEEP THE DARN ORDER!!) so people don't buy duplicate DVDs or go insane trying to watch it in order?!?!?!There's no such thing as darn sagas in the original version.JUST NUMBER THE DARN DVDS!!!!"
1,live in squalor w your turbs as others have done u major dweeb,"u dweeb. when others don't even get an apt or shelter for a turb go f urself.this is one nasty bitch fm n. carolina saying her turb is all that one more time, i'll give her a jesus up her ass with FURY."
5,Very Good Book,I must admit I am a former student of Sean Odom's and so maybe I am bias. He guarenteed me that everything I need to know to pass the Switching Exam was in his book. I passed it with a 940 after reading his book a couple of times. I now only have the Routing Exam left and I will be a CCNP!
4,Great....except the bass drum,"This is a truly great recording of Verdi's emotional Requiem, and I'll not try to add to the other reviews here. However, I do have one little quibble: the bass drum solos in the Dies Irae sections are not played forcefully enough. They are a somewhat unexciting ""boom"" instead of an earth-shaking ""SLAM,"" as in Shaw's and Solti's recordings. This is, as I said, a minor point, but if you're a percussionist like me it can get on your nerves. I recommend getting the Fricsay along with the Shaw or Solti, because apart from the bass drum and the dated mono sound it is a great recording."
4,Swirl sheds light on dating,"I came across this film by recognizing the lead star (Carl Payne) from the Martin Lawrence Show. The film gives a light hearted yet refreshing approach to the subject of interracial dating. Much of the writing seems to pay homage to Kevin Smith. The film has an independent feel to it with some hysterical scenes. The lead (Carl) does a nice job delivering inner conflict and comedy. Overall I enjoyed it. I give it 4 stars, (I never give 5)."
4,Quick review,This movie is Jungle Fever's Worst nightmare. Sarah (Stephanie Denise Griffin) and Beethoven (Carl Anthony Payne II) are lifelong friends. They start a business together and eventually the partnership becomes lovers. However Beethoven is worried that his relationship with a white girl is good for him.A good movie that really takes a look at interracial relationships. You hear bother views as well as Super Sister that gives Beethoven an earful every chance she gets. Only thing is she's in his mind.
5,We Love Joe !!!,"My 4yr old son has several of Mr. Scruggs tapes. I love listening to them as much as he does, and even find myself listening when my son isn't in the car. Joe has a way of seeing things from a kid's point of view. His music is great fun, and appeals to kids of all ages. WE LOVE JOE !!!"
5,absolutly one of the best Pastoral ever recorded!,Wordless to describe. Just listen to it and feel the music without any of your prejudice.
4,Beautiful music (obviously),"This is one of my favourite CDs in western classical music (I am just an amateur listener). Schubert's fifth is one of the most graceful pieces I have heard and makes for an excellent companion to the more famous Beethoven symphony. I cannot comment on the recording itself much, since I haven't heard alternate versions of these symphonies, but it sounds very clear and very well done for the most part. The last movement of the pastoral could probably have been done better, it sounds a bit discordant at times."
5,"BEST RECORDING, BEETHOVEN would approve!",This is a wonderful version of Beethoven's 6th. It's done as close to perfect as any I have heard. Highly rate this item!!
3,A pseudo-classic or a genuine one?,"Critical acclaim for this CD lured me into buying it against my better judgment. Bohm was an estimable, if traditional, Beethoven conductor, and although I knew his style veyr well, I accepted the consensus that he had surpased himself in this Pastorale. For me, he didn't.This is traditionalism personified. Bohm's Pastorale is nicely played--he almost always got good execution--but the rhythms are foursquare, and there is simply no joy anywhere in evidence. I would go for Bruno Walter on Sony with the Columbia Sym. every time. Walter also has a sunny, charming reading of the Schubert Fifth, unfortunatley in mono. But this is an easy symphony to conduct, and the fact that Bohm does it well is not reason enough to call the whole CD a classic."
3,not what it's cut out to be,"i was disappointed with this disc. there isn't enough contrast between the 1st and 2nd movements. the 1st is a little too slow, the 2nd is about right. the sound is beautiful but too lush and refined for a symphony about an outing in the great outdoors. the vpo isn't the right ensemble to record the 6th. a smaller group, maybe using period instruments, would produce a more natural, earthy sound. more spontaneity and a bit more 'zip' in the performance would help, also. bohm is the wrong conductor for the piece."
3,not so good,"I was pretty amazed with this version, due to my dissapoint with Karajan's 6th recorded together with the 5th in the 80's (thank God the 5th is very good!). After some weeks I realized that this particular performance deserves better playing. Although a chamber orchestra would be better for it, I'm sure that this sort of compositions is about refinement, class and perfect tempo. I recommend to try Sir Nevile Marriner versions or to investigate the earlier Karajan recordings to find something really good. An advice: If you like a work, don't listen a bad version. You will ruin your love for it."
2,i'm missing something...,"wow! ya know, i really, really enjoyed miss orrico's second cd. especially the song ""strong enough."" the songs on that cd were about living life, but living it being aware that there's a God who's there and will be with you....no matter what.however, on this one, i don't feel the christian connection. all the songs are about male/female relationships, hugs, kisses, touching, etc. i guess i need to know if the latest project was meant to be contemporary christian, pop, secular...what?there's very little, if any, mention of God. consequently, i was terribly confused as to the purpose of the whole cd. i found it difficult to enjoy, because i couldn't quite get the message.if one finds a formula that works, one should stick with it; maybe making slight alterations, but not complete make-overs.i'm truly one of miss orrico's biggest fans, but i can't quite get with this project. stacie, come back to us..."
2,"Not as good as I remembered, but ...","Saw this when it was first broadcast on television nearly 30+ years ago, as a ""No School Today"" presentation. I often would bring this movie up with friends of my generation and nobody could remember it. It had a catchy opening theme song, which I never forgot. So, imagine my delight of its release on DVD.The print is excellent, and the opening theme song is great as I remember it. But this movie soon went downhill after Mother Goose left for the Moon. Some of the storylines were just too much on the level for a five year old, and soon my wife and I couldn't take much more. But we managed to get through it somehow.Get ""Mad Monster Party"" instead."
2,Mother Goose and Travelin Tyke,"i dont think this video is very good. With all the other great videos for your children out there, this one just didn't stand the test of time. Just my opinion. ..."
3,"""THIS ISN'T A MOVIE!""","This is the more recent of two zombie films by the same name. College kids are trapped on campus during a zombie outbreak of unknown origin. The geek (Brian Oviedo) had perhaps the best lines relating everything to Star Trek. There was an entertaining zombie scene where zombies are consuming body parts, kegger style, with one zombie actually being held upside down while he eats. Nice Touch. However the writers couldn't maintain a decent script and dialouge in spite of using quirky characters.This is not the worse zombie film out there, but it barely makes 3 stars.Parental Guide: F-bomb, no sex, no nudity."
3,Fun Indie Zombie Movie,"Maybe I watched too many Zombie movies over the past year, but I really enjoyed this one. The characters were likeable and the acting and effects were decent. The story dragged in a few places and some of the dialog took you out of the movie. That being said, it was a very fun movie and I would defintely watch it again."
2,So bad I could not finish,"There are good zombie movies and there are bad zombie movies. This one is bad. Lame plot, lousy acting, unbelievable characters. If you like brainless college movies you might enjoy this one."
2,Not very good,"The plot was bad, the acting was bad and the zombies were bad. I didn't like it very much. Not for Zombie afficionado's."
1,Just another review...,"Honestly, I just couldn't get into this movie at all. So plain Jane. Highly not recommended. In fact, please don't watch this movie, it just might kill some Brian cells."
4,"A classic recording, now in better than average sound","Whatever imp lurking in Mr. Hurwitz makes him invent new and ridiculous things to say, it was being especially mischievous here. Kubelik's Dvorak recordings with the Berlin Phil. were notoriously shrill and hard when first transferred to CD, and even now, with evidence of remastering, the sound hasn't lost all of its hardness. It is more listenable than before, however, which is gratifying.As for the performances, I've had my say while covering the complete Dvorak cycles from Kertesz and Kubelik. Just to recap: Kubelik's ""New World"" catches fire in the Scherzo but is otherwise less extraordinary than its reputation holds, while Kertesz shows much more flexibility, vivacity, and power, not to mention better sound. In Sym. #8 the sonic impovements in the Kubelik are very noticeable, but I'd still put the inspired Kertesz ahead (noting that a knowledgable commenter below has problems with its sound)."
2,i'm in the minority here but...,"first of all i hate negative reviews just because someone dislikes an ""interpretation"" of a piece, however i just coudn't find any thing good to say about this cd. dvorak's ninth is mine and many others favorite because of the lyrical quality of the symphony. kubelik seems to ignore this and go right for the drama. the timpani and horns are miked way too loud and the strings are an indistinguishable mush. you can find many better on budget labels. thanks for reading and this review applies only to ninth symphony."
1,don't waist your money,This shoes are not stable at all. When you walk the heels moves. They run supper big. I am a size 9 and I had to buy in a size 8.
5,Just what I needed and prompt delivery,This is a direct replacement for the OEM version. I was a little nervous when I received it but was relieved when I installed it. All the connection screws went in with no problems and the connections snapped into place.
4,"not his best, but mostly entertaining","some have accused augusten of mining the bottom of the barrel for this book. there is some truth in that, but the stories i committed to reading, i found very entertaining and well-written (as usual from augusten). however, i skipped 3 or 4 stories because they were all about childhood (too many childhood stories here i think) or they were about his dogs!! sorry, but i don't give a damn about your pets, man!!! it's so boring reading about people's cats and dogs. nonetheless, i think augusten has ""done it"" yet again. the stories here aren't as outrageous as in ""magical thinking,"" but i still liked them! augusten can write well about just about anything. i look forward to his future books. :)"
5,"Possible Side Effects of ""Augusten Burroughs"" Syndrome","True, this is not released yet, but I have no doubt this title will be as scintillating as the rest of his collection. I continue to suffer from ""Burroughs Syndrome"" and have been paralyzed lately from reading anything else, despite the 15 titles next to my bed. It will be a long four month wait for the release date. Luckily, Jewelry Television is on from 2:00-6:00 a.m."
3,fallen writer,"I don't feel that Possible Side Effects really stands up to the rest of Burroughs's work. Running With Scissors was awesome, an instant classic and his drinking memoir is phenomenal as well. Even his novel, Sellevision, is pretty good. But let's be honest, nobody's life is this interesting, and without the element of truth, Burroughs loses all power (just look at Sellevision). And Burroughs does the vignette very well, most of his work is in that form. But it isn't enough to carry a book (and I'm surprises that Burroughs doesn't publish his work in magazines, it's perfect for the format). But what made his earlier memoirs so powerful is that the vignettes were connected, and together told a story (like Cisneros does in Mango Street). So I guess this is a good bathroom book or one to take on the bus, funnly little quick stories of no real importance."
3,"not his best, but still good.","i really enjoyed Running With Scissors and i absolutely loved Dry. this book was kind of like a flight of ideas, no real surprises, no cohesive story but still amusing. i'll read anything by Augusten Burroughs because i'm hooked on his life. he's an amazing human being and a true survivor."
2,Not David Sedaris,"Augusten Burrough's Possible Side Effects is a thorough disappointment. He attempts to reproduce the humor of David Sedaris, but fails miserably. Burroughs even adds stories of his partner and plays the role of the selfish brute. This is obviously a reproduction of Sedaris and his relationship with Hugh. However, it does not work for Burroughs. His endless references to his drinking cause the reader to be filled with pity, not laughter. The continuous return to images of his laziness and poor hygeine become redundant. His use of vulgarity forces his writing to a rock-bottom level. After reading this book we may all look at him as did the woman on the elevator, as not being worthy to wear any college's t-shirt."
2,Whiny,"This is a collection of mildly interesting stories that become grating very quickly. Burroughs comes across not only as self-absorbed, but also self-righteous. David Sedaris is much funnier and much less cynical. Couldn't make it through 2 full discs."
3,"just okay, not great","I have read three of Augusten's books (Dry, Running With Scissors, and Magical Thinking), and absolutely LOVED them. This book, however, was really disappointing. It wasn't funny, nor particularly interesting. It was just bland. None of the stories were really entertaining. I can't pinpoint exactly what this book is lacking, but it's simply not as well-written as his other books. I would definitely recommend his previous work. This one? Not so much."
2,Disappointed fan,i'm a big fan of augusten burroughs but i can hardly get through this book. it's just not really all that funny - certainly not as clever as his fans would expect. the stories seem really random and forced - almost as if he was ordered by his publisher to crank out another winner but he just didn't really feel like it. he lost his edge on this one. hope he gets it back. he's no sedaris on this one.
4,Possible Side Effects - A. Burroughs,"Very good, easy, light & funny read! Although his best, by far, in my opinion was ""Running with Scissors"". This was an enjoyable read & would recommend reading his work if you like David Sedaris, both have a similiar style."
1,Burroughs Has Lost the Magic,"Burroughs is definitely a one trick pony and the books are getting progressively worse. Running with Scissors was hilarious, although not really all that believable. Dry was my favorite and I enjoyed it regardless of how true the stories are. But Possible Side Effects is just not funny. I'm not even sure he thinks he's funny or even cares. And the personal facts he reveals such as blowing his nose on his shirt and throwing empty food cartons on the floor is flat out disgusting. I realized I have no interest in what a person has to say that has no regard for personal hygiene. I imagine he must have some sort of mental illness such as hoarding all though I really am not interested. I met Burroughs at a book signing in San Francisco and he looked dirty. Get some help and some writing advice from James Frey."
4,"Running with Scissors ""Lite""",Lighter than Running with Scissors but the lack of darkness makes it a better read for some that don't want to delve too deep into some of the issues touched on in Running with Scissors. A very funny book that is enjoyable and well written. Kind of an essay format makes it easy to pick up and read 1 chapter at a time. A book well worth reading!
3,"Good, But Not Augusten's Best","Although this book is no ""Running with scissors"" I still quite enjoyed it's humor, style and selection of short stories. Augusten still remains one of my favorite authors, but something was missing from this book. Perhaps one can only tell about their seriously messed up and strange life once, and then it becomes too much for us readers, who knows, but I still liked it and would recommend reading it if you a fan of his. Caution goes out to those who have never read his other books as it may just come across as weird rantings from a total bore"
1,Mostly Boring and Whiny,"There are people who tell stories and you are engaged and interested not always because of the content, but because of their delivery as well. Augusten Burroughs left me wanting better of both. Maybe it was b/c I listened to this as an audiobook... but I mostly found Possible Side Effects a book full of complaining disguised as a bunch of boring stories. I actually caught myself rolling my eyes a few times! I admit, I didn't get all the way through the book - I was so annoyed I just bailed a few chapters from the end.Just for background - I LOVED Running with Scissors when I read it years ago. I think he used up all his good material in that fascinating memoir. I loved it so much I picked up Sellevision which I gave about 2 chapters and shut it permanently - also annoying."
2,Dear Mr Burroughs,"Unfortunately, ""Possible Side Effects"" has threatened Mr Burroughs' throne in the Number 2 spot on my list of favorite authors. I found this book seriously wanting. It is unlike all his other books, and even though I screamed when I saw the cover at the book store (not knowing Augusten was releasing another book), I was disappointed at its finish.Apologetically, I give this book 2 stars... which is bad for me- I usually enjoy just about everything.Sorry Augusten. I'd still like to be your friend some day."
1,Boring and stupid,"Out of fairness, I should tell you that I didn't listen to the whole audiobook. I got about 1/2 way though the first CD and just couldn't stand it anymore. What I heard was boring and extremely slow moving. It's read like a ""see spot run"" story for children, which makes the boring storyline even more boring and I found it to be a bit insulting. I think an audio book of names and nummbers in the phone book would be more exciting. Maybe it gets better as it goes along, but I am not willing to endure any more to find out."
4,Excellent,"I love this guy's writing style. Very entertaining, comfortable reading, very funny. I just hope some editor does not screw up his conversational writing style."
2,Poor Man's David Sedaris,"This book proves that neurotic and gay does not necessarily equal funny. It doesn't hurt, but some cleverness is required as well. This book doesn't have much cleverness. It is the first book by this guy that I have read and I am going to read Running With Scissors now because it must have been pretty good if it was good enough to get this mediocre book published as a side effect.There are a couple really good stories buried towards the end like the one with ""Sommer"" in the title which was good but not funny and ""What's In a Name"" which I laughed out loud at. His best stories seem to be written about his family and childhood, but most of the stories in this book are obsessive-gay-man-obsessing stories which come off flat and bloggy."
3,"Cute yes....hysterical, no","I'm sorry, but I didn't bust a gut laughing while reading Possible Side Effects. I'll grant that it is cute, but for me self-absorption and self-deprecation do not equate to humor. Burroughs' stories do make some good points, and these are worth pondering. But if this is the state of humor today, then I guess I could be accused of having no sense of humor. For some truly witty writing, try Dave Barry.Overall, this is light airplane reading. It has its place, but not alongside great literature."
5,I love this kind of writing,"I had a bad nosebleed in a plane once too, so I feel for Augustan! In my case, I was just a small kid though and it stopped bleeding soon and wasn't as bad and embarrassing as his.What a witty and hilarious writer. I'm amazed by the brilliantly witty and funny way he expresses and writes down everything. I was completely taken with this book right from the start with grandma and the tooth fairy and I just couldn't stop snickering as I turned the pages and passed from story to story. An effortlessly endearing, and addictively funny read. I read it in just 3 days, which must be a record for me since I only have an hour or two in the evenings to relax."
5,Must have item,"The reviewer who called this groundbreaking is absolutely right. This book's premise can change your culinary life: basically, the premise is that almost anything can be cooked easily and deliciously by putting some olive oil or butter on it and then sticking it in a hot oven for a surprisingly short time. The zucchini are delicious, and I don't even like vegetables. The roasted red onions are wonderful and she shows you how to make soup with the leftovers. Have never had a recipe turn out other than good. If I had to have only three cookbooks, this would be one of them."
1,Incompetent and untested.,"The result in following the cooking methods in ""Roasting A Simple Art"" were disastrous, a kitchen filled with smoke and a very burned chicken. It appears that the cooking methods have not been tested. As consumers we are the ones roasted by purhasing this book."
1,Good way to ruin your pans.,"I found this book on a friend's shelf, and picked it up to look for a simple recipe I could try, to find out if the book was worth buying. I was puzzled by references in each recipe to ""save the juices for deglazing the pan"". Deglazing?Well. I looked up to the front of the book, and found that, by ""deglazing"", she meant ""softening up the fat and juice burnt onto the pan to the point where you might be able to scrape it off"". So, basically, her simple cooking technique means you move your time investment from cooking time to cleaning time. Not a win in my book: cooking is fun; cleaning is dull. :-)"
3,"A good book, if used with caution!","Basically, a very well written cookbook that suffers only from reality. High heat cooking may present no problems in well cleaned ovens, but try anything in a dirty oven and you're bound to be ripping the smoke detector from the wall. Enjoy, but use with caution."
3,Roasting - A pleasure best shared.....,"There is nothing that compares to the simple visceral joy of a lovely roasting. Whether sharing with friends or colleagues there's nothing I like better, which is why I was so excited upon buying this book.The variety and scale of techniques instructed in this book is really staggering and I feel far more competent in this simple art. I feel genuinely empowered to roast these days and it's all thanks to this book. The Double Stuffed Grosvenor Chicken is so good, it's criminal!!"
4,Perfit fit,This base was a direct replacement for the light fixture in my very old Casablanca Ceiling Fan. Easy to install if you have some electrical skills. The fan had some aluminum wire that was replaced with copper as a safety precaution as well. Hope it lasts as long as the original.
1,Don't Bother,"I really like the Christian Classics series, but this one did not translate well into audio form. The reader (an unknown man) does a good job in reading, but has a voice that will knock you out (asleep that is, not a good thing while listening and driving). I have yet to get all the way through. This is not recommended unless you have insomnia and are listening at home. The book urges the reader to pray, covering various experiential reasons to do so (some Biblical references are thrown in, but not enought to my liking, oh well). Pass this one by, there are better audio books out there. Run time: 90 minutes."
5,A Natural Love,"After reading the book, I felt sure that Chris had failed to express his love by himself. As a result, he has joined hands with nature, with deep and vast oceans, with stars and the sun that fall and rise, with golden fields, with rivers and windmills, and with trees and their virgin shadow so that he can love and adore his beloved properly. His honest love demands all the universe for its expression. His poems impress both mind and heart. In short, I found his poems hauntingly lovely."
4,Decent,"This mask definitely served it's purPose at the super bowl game but it didn't have as much detail as the picture does, which was just a little bit of a bummer"
4,Another enjoyable Lance Lopez release,"Lance Lopez is a well kept secret, he's an awesome guitar player. I love his mix of different mixes. One song sounds a little like Stevie Ray, the next like ZZ Top."
4,Guitar Slinger's Delight.,"Out of all the Lance Lopez albums this one is my favourite because it's more restrained than his others.There is plenty here for guitarists to sink their teeth into guitar wise, the songs though are pretty simple and the lyrics are straight forward but it all seems to collectively work together in it's own funky way.So groove out baby and simplify your vision."
1,One of the worst historicals I've ever tried to read,"I had never read any of Janelle Taylor's books, but I was curious about them because I knew she had lots of fans out there. This book, which featured an adventure/romance between government agents Navarro Breed and Elizabeth Lawrence (aka Bethany wind), simply fell flat. I couldn't even finish it.For me, the dialogue killed this novel. At the beginning, the reader was given stilted lectures on the history of the native American uprisings in the 1880s. This information was interesting, but could have been worked into the story more gracefully.Then the characters' speech to each other just didn't ring true. They sounded too modern and almost wooden - rather like the dialogue in a bad TV movie. I didn't sense any chemistry between the main characters and their attachment to one another didn't feel real.I may give Janelle Taylor another chance, but this book is certainly one to avoid!"
1,Good plot but dialogue was a disaster.,"This was the worst romance novel I've read so far. Since the plot was decent I wanted to give the book to one of my favorite authors to rewrite. The dialogue was extremely poor. Since this was only my 2nd book by this author I""m not sure I want to read another one by her. Really painful to read."
1,Very Depressing,"I thought this book would be good, as I loved Sarah Dessen's other books, That Summer and Someone Like yOu, but this was very bad (in my opinion). It started off okay, but it got so much worse. It was horribly depressing. Someone else said it made her midly sick. Me too. I felt so depressed, and it was summer! Don't read this unless you like abusive boyfriend/sad books"
1,Depressing,"When I began to read this book it sounded like a fantasy novel. But it turned into a story about drugs. If you like depressing scary stories this is the book for you! I would suggest ""THis Lulaby"" instead."
5,really good,"dreamland was such a good book- i really couldnt put it down. i hate to sound like everyone else out there that says those same words, but i had been looking for dreamland for quite a while before i found it because it for some reason was not stocked at my local bookstore. dessen writes beautifully, and the descriptions are perfect... you can almost see rogerson and why she could easily fall for him. it is sad to know what to will happen to caitlyn eventually, and you can easily read the signs while she is too lovestruck to see them. overall, i think this book is really powerful."
4,Dreamland,"Dreamland is about an average girl living in the shadow of her older sister Cass. So, when Cass leaves, without a word to anyone, the spotlight shines on Caitlin. At first, Caitlin can handle it, being a cheerleader, hanging out with her best friend, but soon the pressure starts to take a toll on her. Then, she meets Rogerson, who seems great at first, starts demanding all of her time. After time, he starts hitting her and getting her involved in drugs. She stays with him, and continues to let him hit her, until it becomes too much. Rogerson makes Caitlin give up her photography for him, and that's too much. When her friend drags her to spend the day with her, and she keeps Rogerson waiting. That's when the secret's out...."
3,Very nice book to read for teenagers,Dreamland was a very interesting book to read. I read this book for a project and found that I indeed liked the book. It is a very good book for young people to read and also for adults to read and understand what a teenager goes through. All in all this book would be one of the best book for anyone who just wants to take a look at the life of a troubled youth.
5,Love It!!!!!!,"OMG! This book is totally amazing, it really deals with teens issue. I couldn't put the book down because I wanted to know what's going to happen next. It didn't really had a happy ending but at least Caitlin problems were finally solve. I thought Rogerson was the guy that Caitlin needed in her life but he end up causing more pain and more problems that Caitlin couldn't deal with. This books is something your should read it's a must book."
3,It's ok,I read a lot and a variety. This was a struggle to get into! Some things were not up to date like smoking in the high school bathroom! It does take a turn towards the middle of the book. That's where it started to be a page turner. It wasn't by any means the worst I had read nor was it the greatest.
2,Not great,"I was not impressed by this book. IMO, it was weak and quite boring. I would not recommend this book."
4,Dreamland sucks you in,"I thought this book was great. Once I started reading it, I got so sucked in that I couldn't put it down. I felt so much for Caitlin, because she just seemed so lost throughout the book. And to be honest, I also fell for Rodgerson. The way Dessen described him at first, I could just imagine an attractive, brilliant, deep ""bad boy"" with dreads and beautiful green eyes. And the first time he hit her, I literally said out loud ""Oh my god, he didn't!"". The only character who really got to me was Cass. I thought she was selfish for leaving Caitlin and her family, and it bothered me that Caitlin never really got angry with her. All in all, this book was really good. Dreamland was the first book by Sarah Dessen that I read, and I can't wait to read more of her books. I would defenitely recomend this book."
4,Dreamland,"This book is a book that describes much feeling to the reader. Caitlion O'Karen is a sophmore in Highschool and deals with things no person should ever have to deal with! Her sister ran away from home to be with her new boyfriend Adam on Caitlions 16th Birthday.. She falls in love with this wild mysterious guy who seems to no everything, but when caitlion starts to see the dark side in her boyfriend everything starts going full speed down hill! I really recremend reading this book! I wasnt able to put it down!"
3,Not typical Dessen,"This is definitely a big break from the typical Sarah Dessen mold. It was a good book, but a difficult, emotional read. A definite should read for teens though."
4,All about life,Dreamland by Shara Dessen is about a girl named Caitlin. The day of her 16th brithday her sister Cass runs away. No one knows why but Caitlin was left with a journal that she gave her. The journal she gave her was for her write her dreams in. Caitlin had to see for herself what her sister had gone through and now knows why her sister left. I enjoyed reading this book. It was a type of book that deals with teenagers and what they are going through.
4,Dreamland,"I loved this book. Sarah Dessen wrote a truly amazing story about love, family, and friendship. She captured the exact kind of relationship that sisters have and the effects of their love and friendship on one another and what happens when one suddenly leaves. Caitlin's relationship with Rogerson is an all true tale of what is going on in many teenage girls' relationships and what they go through. A job well done and a good read for anyone who has a sister."
2,Sickly Depressing,"I can't make myself like this book. At first, I thought it sounded good. From the back, I thought it might possibly be a fantasy novel. Not even close. Some of the characters are interesting, but not a heck of a lot of them. The plot is so depressing it left me feeling mildly sick afterwards. I really liked This Lullaby by the same author, but Dreamland just makes me feel like the whole world is being sucked into a pit of despair and strife.Dreamland is about Caitlin, a teenager who meets Rogerson. Rogerson seems like a kind, mysterious boyfriend. At first. The next thing Caitlin knows she has to wear long sleeves and pants all the time to cover her bruises.I suppose this book is a clear window into abusive relationships and why people stay in them, but if you are just looking for a good read, well... Let's just say that if you like depressing books about drugs and abusive boyfriends, you might like this story. If you don't fall into those categories, stay clear of this book."
2,"Wake up, Caitlin.","When Cass leaves after being accepted to Yale and living what is described as a perfect life, Caitlin is left to pick up the pieces. Her mother has always fawned over Cass and now it's Caitlin's turn. She's encouraged to join the cheerleading squad she has no interest in and soon meets up with Rogerson, an abusive drug addict who soon has her flunking out, drinking and drugging and getting knocked around. I don't think the author did a good job making the reader understand why Caitlin stayed in the relationship as long as she did. And, though I understand the mother had to be portrayed as someone who would needle until someone would want to run away, the mother irritated the snot out of me. When Caitlin did think her mom had finally figured out her secret and was going to confront her, the mother was simply confronting Caitlin on the lack of color she had been wearing in her wardrobe. Not much of a plot here. Can't say as I enjoyed the book at all."
1,Sucked beyond what I thought possible,"So boring to start off with, I can't believe I actually read the entire book. A complete waste of my time. Also her boyfriend starts beating her and she stays with him, and doesn't tell anybody about it. It personally frustrated the crap out of me because all I could think of is that I would never allow a guy to do that to me. The first time ""Rogerson"" slapped her I would have hit him in his goodies so hard he wouldn't have known what hit him. So if your not getting into the deep meaning of the entire story line, its pretty much a load of frustration."
1,Not believable,"I do not understand the good reviews for this book. I don't see the motivation for the main character to stay with her abusive boyfriend. He is never really very nice to her nor is he charming or sympathetic in anyway. All we know about him is that he is a drug dealer who has a good memory for trivia and a father who hits him. Then when he starts hitting her, there is no real reason for her to stay with him since he is not nice or interesting at all even before he becomes abusive. It is also hard to believe that a formerly committed student who did not do drugs would suddenly not care about her studies and suddenly decide to watch bad television in an old farmhouse and get stoned all day. The author failed to make me care about a single character."
2,kibri,"i bought the book for my daughter. i always let her read about the book before i order it, but this time she was dissappointed. She said the book is boring and she didnt like the fact that it was based on a sister whom was nearly grown & college aged who ran away. Her input was why are the so focused on the sister running away? WHO CARES SHE ALMOST GROWN, she states the story drags on & on before any action happens"
5,Best book I have ever read!,From the first page i fell in love with this book. The book is soo good I didn't put it down for 4 hours. I have readit 3 times already. It is a must read!
4,Dreamland,"I felt the novel, Dreamland, was a book to learn by. Although Caitlin had to face very traumatic incidents in her life, the people who read the book learn by her mistakes. We see what the actual consequences are, although she didn't see them at the time.It is awful for one human being to go through what she did, but look at how many millions of other girls it touched. Although this was a fiction book, it could very easily be true in someone's life. It takes a very brave soul to live in torment like she did, and the book also shows courage through that. It teaches young adults, that no matter what you may go through, you have the strength to come through it."
5,Dreamland,"Girls why do we stay in abusive relationships and let ourselves deal with it? Rogerson caitlins supposed dream guy all of a sudden snaps and starts abusing her. Taking his anger out of cait she doesn't know what to do a lot has been happening... recently her sister cass ran away to be with her boyfriend, things just dont seem to be gonig right. Now she is in an abusive relationship and thinks drugs may be the only easy way out"
5,You Won't Want to Wake Up!,"This is absolutely fabulous. It completely sucks you in till you're ready to cry right along with Caitlyn as she deals with the conflict and pulls of her suddenly altered life. I've never before read anything that dealt with abusive relationships like that and I can totally understand and relate to ever decision she had to make and why she did what she did. Took me like a day to read because I couldn't put it down. If you're a teen, (even a boy), you need to read this.Spend some time in Dreamland...you won't want to wake up!"
2,Dessen Fails To Impress,"As a big fan of Sarah Dessen, I bought this book eagerly, hoping for a light but enjoyable teen girl story. I was disappointed.Dessen tells the story of Caitlin, a high school student whose older sister, Cassandra, has been the prettier, smarter, and more talented daughter her entire life. With Cassandra poised to leave for Yale, Caitlin hopes to step out of her shadow. But Cassandra runs away the night before Caitlin's birthday, leaving her family bewildered and sending them on a downward spiral of depression and anxiety.The premise, though clichéd, is interesting, and where Dessen goes wrong is the execution. Caitlin often sounds whiney and trite, and her decent into drug use and abuse is not very realistic. Even the various well written supporting characters cannot save this book. If you're looking for a good teenage depression book, try 'Speak' by Laurie Halse Anderson, or look into some of Dessen's lighter fare, like 'This Lullaby'."
2,~Exspect the Unexspected~,I was disappointed wasn't the best work of Sarah Dessen. I guess I exspected to much from her. Although it did have its moments I must say that. I kind of felt like I just wanted it to be over and that it was to dragged. That's just my opionion.
5,Really Good Book!,"Wow! I started this book yesterday and I couldn't put it down, except when it was time to go to bed. The characters are so real, and each chapter leaves you wanting more. There was a lot of emotion in this book. It was a tearjerker, and a love gone bad. I am really glad i read this and reccomend it to anyone who isn't sure to read it or not."
2,Loved them all but this,Ok i started this book with an open mind...i didnt no going into the book that she was going to get abused....so it was a huge shock when he was kissing her and she would bring up a conversation and her would start beating her up..i was so surprized. but if your into that kind of book...then this is your book but if you like books with walk off into the sunset books (like me) then this is not your book.
4,Dreamland,"Dreamland is about Caitlin and her sister Cass runs away and Caitlin was always in her shadow. Cass runs away and Caitlin becomes a cheerleader which she doesn't want to be one. She falls in love with Rogerson and he ends up beating her up. I loved this story. I could see a little of my past relationship in Caitlin and Rogerson, (my ex never beat me) and I know how she felt. It is a wonderful story."
5,Eye Opening Book,"In a rather short yet compelling novel Dessen again has you fall in love with the characters and make it almost impossible to put down the book. The story follows a year in the life Of Caitlin O'Keron, a high school junior stuck in the shadow of a perfect older sister and in an absuive relationship.Throught out the novel you fall in love with Caitlin and Rogerson, her absuive but at times loving boyfriend. You will cringe, laugh, cry and sigh through out this book and will be sorry when it ends.A must read for teenage girls!"
4,Dreamland,"Oh goodness. Talk about a tearjerker! From the very beginning, I was totally ready to cry and that was before the real plot even started! At first, I was only reading this before I went to bed; maybe twenty or thirty pages a night. But I got sucked into the book and the characters, and I just wanted to reach out to Caitlin and just hold her. I believe I've said this before, but I'm a very, I guess, visual person. Whenever I read something, I always imagine the same situation going on in my life, or in my family and what I would do if it were me going through this. It really brings out hidden emotion if you think about Caitlin's situation this way. What would you do?I'm so happy this was my first Sarah Dessen novel. It wasn't too heavy, but at the same time addressed such a serious problem in teenage relationships, and even with relationships later on in life. It's heartbreaking, but oh so beautiful at the same time.Read the specifics?[...]~Thalia Anderson"
3,Master Of Judo,"I think this book was okay, but it has some action like where Oliver is overboard, or where he is kidnapped, and I'd also be interested in learning Judo. As for the other parts, they're normal but still okay."
2,Not a happy ending,It's okay and has a lot of excitement and the judo lessons in the book is perhaps helpful but it has a few satisfying endings.
4,"Feet slide out at first, but the shoes were great afterwards","These are great swimming shoes for a little girl. I bought the ones in pink for my daughter and she looks adorable in those. They work great in and out of water. As with the previous reviewer, her feet were sliding out at first, but stopped after a few days. I would have given the product 5 stars if it weren't for the ""sliding out"" phase."
1,waste of money,"My daughter's feet keep sliding out the front of the shoes. The size is just right but since the shoes are ""elastic"" they don't keep the feet in place. I keep seeing all my daughter's toes outside the shoes and have to slide her feet back in place just to repeat it again and again over the use. Not worth the money!!!"
5,Also sprach Zarathustra from 1896,"The symphonic poem Also sprach Zarathustra by Strauss, is from 1896. It is widely known, especially the opening. This is a great performance with Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. Also here is Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks, Don Juan, and Salome's Dance of the Seven Veils from from his 1905 opera Salome."
3,where's the joy?,"Karajan's account of Zarathustra is too solemn, tempos are too slow. Zarathustra is supposed to be a joyous work, a revelation to mankind of new truths, an occasion for celebration. Instead, this recording too often sounds like a wake. Reiner's 1954 recording captures the right spirit. And at 31+min, it's also a full 4min faster."
1,Revlon Just Peachy Cream Blush Is Great,"The Just Peachy cream blush is great with my light complection and reddish hair. I have used it for years and love the way that it spreads on so easily. The stores no longer carry it, so I was delighted to find it online."
1,Did not like,"It is very easy to apply. If you are looking for a good peach shade, this is not it; ""Just Peachy"" is a light pasty-looking peach that when applied to the back of the hand shows up in the pores and that is not what a cream blush should do......plus it looks garish. I threw it right in the trash. But if you like that light, bright, pasty-looking peach shade that looks like clown paint, then go for it. I also didn't care for Revlon's Photo Ready blush in the ""Pinched"" shade for the same reasons."
3,Good.,"It's nice and cheap, but applying it is kinda hard, if I may say. It doesn't really stick to a sponge or a blush brush and I had to apply it a few times just so it stays and actually, APPEAR! Not the easiest to use."
4,"Good Recording, but Giulini's verson is better","This recording of Rostropovich/Karajan is, of course, the editor's choice when it comes to Dvorak's cello concerto. But, editors simply passed over the Rostropovich/Giulini version, which is the better recording. It is now on the EMI Classics label, remastered, and is also on Rostropovoich's 75th birthday edition on the EMI Label. As a cellist, I feel Karajan's taste is good, but not as heartfelt as Giulini's."
3,Engineers Maul Great Performance,"This, one of the most significant concerto recording sessions of the Cold War decades, is also one more occasion when I am thankful for keeping my vinyl LP collection in good order: in short, DG's new digital re-mastering has mauled a priceless dialog between the greatest cellist and Karajan's peerless band.Immediacy is gone; projection in the solo instrument has been banished to a back row, leaving Rostropovitch as just one more orchestral member. The fault of incompetent sound engineers meddling with what was already a definitive balancing act in the LP version.Lucky, then, that this work of Dvorak -- perhaps his finest -- is one of the most symphonic of concertos. Partial submersion of the solo part beneath the BPO's luscious sound surface is not as complete a tragedy as it might have been."
2,Over-rated and over-blown,"Not only is this not the best Rostropovich version (try the ones with Boult or Khaikin) but it is not nearly as good as some more recent versions, such as Jean-Guilhen Queyras on Harmondia Mundi (with perfect balance between soloist and orchestra and a deeply poetic and powerful interpretation)or Hoelscher with Keilberth on Warner/Teldec (wonderfully executed). There is of course the classic version by Fournier with Szell and Casals with Szell. If you must have Rostropovich, get the Khaikin version with those wonderfully fruity Russian horns: he sounds so much better there than with Karajan whose orchestra is just overblown."
3,"Dvorak overblown and lacking passion, Tchaikovsky exceptional","For years I have read that this recording of the Dvorak Cello Concerto is one of the best. When I finally heard it, I hated it. The interpretation is overblown and the playing is cold. And the conductor is heartless, nothing new for the vastly overrated HVK. On the other hand, I found the Tchaikovsky to be absolutely wonderful. The Dvorak sounds like a recording, the Tchaikovsky like a performance."
2,try Feuermann's,"I first heard Feuermann's version, and then this one. I have to say there is no comparison. I can't say Rostropovich is a bad cellist, but he seems to have very different philosophy and style as Feuermann, and I just can't find his playing a treat."
5,best candle lights ever!,originally purchased 4 of these for each of my front windows...upon receiving them i immediately purchased 4 more to use elsewhere...solid construction with a realistic flickering light that creates a nice ambient glow...highly recommended!
4,Workmanlike espionage tale,"If you liked Gorky Park, you'll like this too as it has the same flavor. The difference between the 2 is that this film isn't as overtly dramatic nor glamorous. The majority of the characters, except for Barbara Parkins & Bibi Andersson, are people you wouldn't notice if they passed you on a sidewalk which is the hallmark of a good spy: Ordinariness. No Bond's or Tom Cruise's here. There's not much more that I can say without giving away the whole plot, but I do recommend seeing The Kremlin Letter as it gives you a VERY sanitized taste of certain aspects of the trade & the type of people one deals with in it. And the ending's a killer!"
3,Cold War spy movie,"Good Cold War spy movie if you like that genre. Plot is confusing and far-fetched, difficult to follow. This movie is not for children or the sensitive, due to graphic violence and sexual inuendo. But it captures the mood and spirit of Russia under communist rule in 1970 with perfection and style. This movie has class in spite of it's shortcomings."
5,"The title says it all, amazing.","Spider-Man was created in the early 60's against all reasonable ideas. The character broke all of the rules of comics at the time, and continued to for many, many years to come. (The Comic-Code, the Wedding...)This is a reprint of the first appearance of Spider-Man, the origin, and the first ten issues of the first title, The Amazing Spider-Man, which sets up a lot of the early story arcs and bad guy origins. This is a must-have if you claim to be a fan of Spider-Man. It is one thing to know the story, it is another to actually have read it and this book allows us to.I know that these volumes are a bit pricey, but you can usually find reasonably priced used ones on here. I got this first edition, a little beat up, for just a couple of bucks. Well worth it for the early writings of Stan Lee as well as the great early work of Steve Ditko!"
1,The only mix that matters is missing from this release,"""Freelove"" was a huge club track for Depeche Mode in early 2002. The ONLY mix that got any play in the clubs was the ""Deep Dish Freedom Mix"" - by far the best of all the remixes of this song. Deep Dish even went so far as to make two versions of the mix (one for Europe and one for the U.S.) to promote to the clubs. Their stellar version of ""Freelove"" was a standout in the fact that it actually sampled DM's own ""Enjoy The Silence"" and in how it brought Dave Gahan's vocals out into the forefront. Unfortunately for Depeche Mode fans this mix has never been released.Without the Deep Dish mix the rest of this CD appeals only to the most hard-core fan."
1,Where's the Deep Dish remix???,"OK, so the Deep Dish remix of ""Freelove"" hit #1 on Billboard's dance chart AND just so happened to be one of the most slamming club tracks of the past year.... so where is it? Apparently DM are not fans of house music (??!?!) and did not authorize the commerical release of the Deep Dish mix. What a shame. I've never been a DM fan but would have actually bought a copy of this because Deep Dish is amazing and I missed my small window of opportunity to snag a promo-only 12"" vinyl copy of it. Sour grapes on my part? Perhaps. Stupid marketing decision by DM and their record label? Absolutely."
1,Stupid stuff,"I have not read such a load of rubbish in a long time...the ""writer"" has engaged in a vapid polemic which, in plain English, is nonsense..."
2,stinky stuff,"It might work well, but I smelled like I just rinsed my head in a fruit smoothie - it's nauseating."
5,What leaves a lasting impression,"More often than not, the first time you hear a piece of music and it catches your ear, it is that rendition which benchmarks all others for you. I grew up with this album so it naturally has more meaning to me (years of listening to its nuances, tempo, and performance) than others. So this recording is my personal bias.I love both of piano concertos; No. 17 & No. 21. My recording doesn't have the addtional Concerto #6 which was obviously added later. Geza Anda plays artistically (not mechanically or lack of emotion)and the orchestra supports him full heartedly. But just knowing the other two concertos well I think qualify me to say that if you wish to introduce someone to classical music, this may be the very disc that will hook them for life. It's expressive and easy to listen to and Mozart certainly was a Master of beautiful music."
1,Poorly executed,"Bought this one over some of the others because of the digital window. Unfortunately, the mechanism that drives the digital display makes a very loud crack every time the clock goes past the hour mark. There is quite a bit of resistance from the hands at the hour mark. Too much, in fact, for my three year old to advance the hands. It's quite ridiculous."
3,It's not as great as i was hoping,"Aside from the fact that I ordered the wrong size, it is not as cool as I was hoping. If your are just starting out photography/videography do not get this; you will just waste your time."
5,Uriah Heep show a must for fans!!!,"I have been a Heep fan for years but never got to see them live in concert. Well, this is about as close as I can get for now. The DVD is great. The sound is excellent. I love this band. Mick & the boys are in fine form. I got mine through their on-line store so my copy was autographed by the band! It is a great retrospective of the band. A sort of 'history lesson' if you will. I also own the ""Live In Moscow"", ""Acoustically Driven"" & ""Electrically Driven"" DVDs, which are all great too. So grab these discs while you can. This band ROCKS!!!!"
5,EXTRAORDINARIA PRESENTACION EN VIVO,"ES INCREIBLE COMO URIAH HEEP SE MANTIENE DESPUES DE TREINTA AÑOS, ES COMO SI EL TIEMPO SE HUBIERA DETENIDO.SOBRETODO SUSONIDO Y ENERGIA EXTRAODINARIA.ESTE GRUPO HA SENTADO UN PRECEDENTE EN EL ROCK CLASICO DEBIDOA SU ESTILO UNICO DE VOCES, COROS MEZCLADO CON LA FUERZA DE SU SONIDO VIBRANTE.SE LO RECOMIENDO SOBRETODO AL AMANTE DEL BUEN ROCK CLASICO."
4,This is a lot of comic books,"This set contains five hundred-plus Spider-Man comic books spread amongst ten CDs. Unfortunately, I haven't finished the first CD as I don't enjoy reading the PDF comics on my desktop computer as much as I had thought. Still, there's no other way I'd ever see most of these classic comics so I'd recommend this to all Spider-Man fans. I'd especially suggest this for comic book fans who own laptops as it seems ideal for a long train or plane ride."
2,"Excellent idea, poor execution","I've been reading Spider-Man for over 30 years now, and when I saw this Advertised I thought it was an excellent idea. The actual product has some significant flaws, however. First and foremost is the quality of the books they scanned. Many of the issues, especially from 1962-65, are so tattered and banged up that they'd be graded 5.0 (out of 10) at best. The omission of the annuals and giant-size issues from the compilation is a curious oversight. And although I understand their desire to not have people printing up copies of their work willy-nilly, stamping ""MARVEL"" across every single page is distracting and disruptive.You'd be hard pressed to find a bigger Spidey fan than me, but I can't recommend this software. If you want to read these issues you'd be better off buying physical reprints, which are plentiful and inexpensive."
4,The way they should be!,"I prefer Adobe's PDF format to that crummy CBR app. PDFs are easy (to least for me) to read and set up in my own reading settings, so Spidey's set here is a MARVELous collection that displaces those old short boxes full of comics with an always- pristine collection that is easy to navigate and wonderful fun to re-read.A ton of discs, though, could've been done on one 8.5 gig DVD. Food for thought for the future. A lot of CDs are clunky. Still, a terrific way to bring classic comics into the present day! Kudos! Love it!!!"
4,Just what I was looking for...but for US customers only!,"Looks like an amazing set, even though I have 90% of the issues included I'd love to own this. However, as an Australian I am ineligible to buy this. All overseas customers should be aware that this is classed as ""software"" and non-US citizens cannot purchase it. Very disappointing.Apparently them dern fer-ners can't be trusted not to re-sell these CD-ROMs to terrorists."
1,so disappointed,I was so excited to get this item and now that i got it I am so mad. This is horrible the fabric is just hard to look at and the little bows and things just awful. I wanted what she had on in the pic. SAVE YOUR MONEY
5,Understand your child without reading an ADHD reference,"After 8 years of trying to understand my daughter, I found her in this book. I knew she thought differently, but all the professionals were stumped as to how to help her. I finally found this book and it was as if I saw my daughter for the first time. Not only did it identify her learning style perfectly, I was able to see how that learning style formed her personality and how she reacted, positively and negatively, to different situations. As a parent, that understanding has allowed me to be more proactive with her education and more patient in my parenting. I recommend this book to anyone, especially those parents or caregiving professionals who know there's more to their child than what is being seen."
4,Tremendous help in understanding my children,"Until I read this book I just couldn't understand how to relate to my young son. Though I can't say that I agree with everything in this book, it was a huge help in learning how my son was figuring out his world. He learns through his eyes! My older son and I learn through our ears. I thought everyone did until I read this book. It is just as valid to learn through your eyes or your fingers or your movements as it is through your ears. Every parent and teacher should read this book."
3,Ok product,This ear phone set up is average at best. The roll up feature is rarely used and adds weight to the wire assembly.The ear pieces dont fit that great. Would look harder next time I buy a like kind of item.
4,Love it,"I must say for the price, it has a really good focal point and shows promise to those starting out."
1,Don't waste your money,"This is just interviews and a reader telling the story/history of POD. If that is what you are into get it, if not...pass it by."
2,much much too slow,"I love slow tempi, and I love Giulini, and I love the Eroica, but I can't stand this performance, except for the slow movement.The music is so slow, that I can't wait for the next sound.The Funeral March is wonderful and uplifting, so you may wish to have this disk for one good track, but otherwise, keep searching. It isn't easy to find a good eroica.Bruno WalterBeethoven: Symphonies Nos. 3 ""Eroica"" & 8is the best I found till now."
3,boring,"giulini is lyrical, introspective, maybe too self-indulgent. to my ears, the music doesn't sing. try fricsay if you like slow tempos. his reading is much more interesting."
5,Correction to Ms. Gelfand's Review,"As much as I appreciate Ms. Gelfand's very positive review, I wish to make a correction. Using the Flesch Readability Scale, the publisher determined that the book's vocabulary is at a high school junior's level. Also, librarians have often placed the book in their adult reading sections because of the sophistication of the subject matter and the subtlety of the Justices' opinions."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CASE,"I purchased a iPod video and the case has scratched up the screen around the outside. On the inside of the case they've got some ruff edges that will damage you iPod screen.If you'd like scratches on your iPod screen then purchase this case, but if you'd like to keep your screen from being scratched then STAY AWAY FROM THIS CASE!!"
1,Crap product,"I have a pretty black ipod which now has the front screen scratched up from abrasive wear due to this case. It is rarely, if ever, taken out of the case so this is not due to extensive use on my part although the plastic does not allow good viewing of videos.AVOID THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!In hindsight, I should have left the factory plastic over the front but in my ignorance I thought ""this is what I bought this pretty case for."""
2,"ok, but messy","these were by far my least favorite of the gel pads. I tried Medela, Gerber, Platex and Ameda. The Platex ones were just really gooey and messy. It took a while to get all the residue off before nursing. They were relieving, but not even in the same ballpark as the others. I HIGHLY recommend the Ameda ComfortGel hydrogel pads. They last MUCH longer, absolutely no mess or stickiness like the others and are so soothing - especially if you keep them in the fridge between uses like the lactation consultant at the hospital recommended to me"
2,Not impressed,"A lot of people recommended using gel pads. I tried them but there was no real relief from nipple soreness and the pads are very sticky, so you have to thourghly wash after you take them off. I wouldn't buy them again."
4,Part 2 in a series about a young girls life.,"""The Lost Traveller"" continues where ""Frost in May "" ended.However the name of the main character has been changed from Nanda Grey to Clara Batchelor.This book is about Clara's life throughout her teenage years.It is a wonderful and moving novel which deals with Clara's intense relationship with her parents and her life after she leaves her strict convent boarding school.It is set during world war one and is,in itself, a very tragic novel.I would reccomend reading it as part of the series rather than on it's own.The characters are so real that it's hard to beleive it's a fictional novel.I love this book and this series and it's really suitable for anyone.Read it."
2,Stereo Headphone Adaptor for Motorola 2.5mm Phones,When this arrived I opened the okg and immediately the mute button (slider) fell off. I guess you get what you pay for. I crazy glued it back on and the adapter works fine a little messy because of the long cord and when attached to headphones an even longer cord. The mic works fine no complaints from callers on the other end. Overall a good product a good experience (except for the button falling off). If you can find them a pair of headphones with a shorter cord would be perfect.
2,Great while it lasted,"I bought this item a while ago for my Moto Q9m and it worked great for about 3 months. Even answering the phone while in the car, people could hear fine on the other end. Then it fell apart. The wiring came undone.I would recommend this product if you are going to use it and leave it in one place. However, if you are going to be moving it around or carrying it with you, avoid it. It will probably break with use as mine did. I bought the Seiko and so far, so good."
5,Understand What Makes People Tick,"I first read INFLUENCE in its original version, ""INFLUENCE, The Psychology of Persuasion,"" in 1996 (the two books are virtually identical). Simply put, of all the books I've read on sales and marketing, INFLUENCE has made the greatest positive impact on my success. Personally, I think this is because the book was not written for marketers -- it is simply a study of why people go on auto-pilot when making certain decisions.You should be careful, however, when applying the concepts, because they will work as well when you're attempting to manipulate people as when you're being straight-forward and honest. (So make sure you don't cross the line and do anything unethical.)In my opinion, this book is absolutely a ""must read"" for anyone who is in sales or marketing. In fact, I think anyone who buys or sells anything should read this one.Enjoy,Gill"
4,The book on influence,"Cialdini is an expert in the field of influence. The book is a comprehensive study on the psychology of influence. It is a indispensible tool for professionals involved in sales and marketing and negotiations, but it has practical applications for everyday social intereactions as well.Cialdini explains techniques (aka weapons of infleunce) that can be used to gain compliance from others. These techniques are drawn from real-life situations. While he constantly cites academic sources and laboratory experiments, the book remains accessible to the casual, non-academic reader. Illustrations, cartoons, and ""reader's reports"" are sprinkled throughout which helps the book stay firmly grounded in practicality. The study questions at the end of the chapter help to pull each chapter's ideas together.To critics of the book many of the ideas presented are seen as common sense, but I really think that everyone can benefit from reading this book."
4,Interesting book on what influences us,This book describes the external circumstances that influence our choices. The information is interesting and helpful for those who are motivated by externals. Unfortunately too many people are erroneously motivated. I recommend Optimal Thinking: How to Be Your Best Self to anyone who is interested in being optimally self-motivated by doing their best in any situation.
1,same book,"Pleae note that this book and ""Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion"" are the same in content. So dont waste your money as I have done !! That's what my 1 star is for.I have not yet read this book in detail. When I have done it I will write another review on it."
2,What side is this guy really on?,"I had always held Caldini's work in high regard. But this was before I understood that he means not to educate the public in order to empower them to withstand the techniques of advertisers, but rather to give advertisers, marketers, and other salespeople new weapons in their ongoing battle against human consciousness.From reading his first book on influence, I thought Cialdini believed that persuasion professionals posed a problem. I thought he was on the side of autonomous thinking by individuals, and hoping to persuade the persuasion professionals to cease their debilitating attacks on the public through advertising and public relations.This book, and his consulting practice, reveal that he is just another advertiser - just another person using the most advanced psychological techniques against human beings.His is an especially dark art, given how much America needs to wake up right now."
3,Good for Psych Class,Got this book for a social psychology class. Can read slow sometimes. Good information over all. Still easier to read then my text book.
3,Interesting read,"I actually enjoyed this book somewhat but it wasn't quite what I expected. After reading most of the reviews I thought this was a book I couldn't afford not to have as part of my library. Many of the ideas presented were the same recycled ideas you find in other sales related books. I guess that is just a testament to their effectiveness. There were a couple of new approaches I wasn't familiar with so I was satisfied. For anyone new to sales/marketing this is a definite winner. For those who are a little more seasoned, it is good book to have in the library but not necessary."
4,You're a sucker,"The doorbell rings, you open it to find a salesman hawking his wares unmercifully upon you. For some reason you just can't say no. Cialdini explains why in this wonderfully entertaining thesis on the psychological trips and traps of our society.Put this in your library next to 48 Laws of Power, under the section How to Be Darth Vader."
5,"Great book, but watch out!","First off this is a great book and is written in a very accessable style. Just be aware that this book is the same (although updated I think) as ""Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion"". I got them both with ""buy both and save"" only to find that out when I started to read the second one."
4,"Had to read it, but good nontheless","I had to read this book for a graduate marketing class. I enjoyed it much more than most of my required readings. However, don't give a copy of this book to anyone you don't trust or has too much power over you because the things taught in this book really work."
2,"Really nice, but...","Does sound like a chime. Chain is too long, but if you use it without the chain straight onto the keychain, it will break. Now I might just drill a hole straight through the metal to get it ""working"" again. Other than that, looks GREAT!"
3,Detailed drawings and maps put Parisian buildings in context,"At first, I was disappointed with this book, as it contains only architectural drawings of Parisian buildings and no photos. It also contains only very brief entries on each building, often just the vital statistics of the date built, architecture, patron, etc.However, reading through it completely I came to appreciate it more. The drawings are all very well done and reveal architectural points and overall themes to buildings that it's hard to capture with photos.What I liked best, though, were the 3-D maps of each quarter as a whole, with detailed maps of each area within the quarter. These well-drawn maps show the fabric of each area and how the buildings relate to each other and to the open spaces. It also makes it easier to visualize where each building is, if you don't happen to be in Paris when you are reading the book."
3,needs pix,"without question the illustrations are fine. the problem is that this book cries out for photos---photos that do justice to each structure, whether historic or contemporary photos are used. poisson has fine sketches, but more is needed. And not only photos, but perhaps more historical background to the buildings."
2,great box of crap,I was excited when i picked this set up. but when i got home tears began to roll. the dvd transfers suck!!!!!!!!!!like a vcr to dvd burner bootleg quality. grainy and the subtitles dont even fit on the screen so you have no idea whats going on. and if they do fit the screen the words are in pure white so they are IMPOSSIBLE to read next to the bright backgrounds. I gave it 2 stars for the 2 movies you could understand. BE VERY CAUTIOUS BUYING ANY OLD KUNG FU ON DVD MOST I HEAR ARE LIKE THIS!!! one film on here i saw before called shoalin strikes back looked and sounded better on vcr tape !!!!!!
