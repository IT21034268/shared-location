2,More Magic Please,"I've read many Lois Duncan books and this one is one of my least favorites. I found it boring; very dull. I didn't like Nancy, who was very selfish. I just didn't understand why she put her own happiness in front of her mother's. The one thing I did like was how the book was not only focused on Nancy, but also on Kirby and Brendon. I wouldn't recommend this book. More magic please."
5,A very well-written book!,"This is a great book! I wish I could learn what happened to Nancy and what she did with her powers, but the book was definitely great. I think the author (Lois Duncan) either has ESP or is interested in it, because in The Third Eye (also written by her), there is a girl that has ESP. A Gift Of Magic is a very rewarding and fulfilling book, and you should read it if you haven't!"
3,An okay book,I liked the book A Gift of Magic. I thought that it was neat how when the old woman died she left her grandchild the gift of magic. But Nancy used the gift to do bad things until she learned to control it. Then she used the gift to help people.
3,"Very good book, but bad ending","Wow I loved this book so much and now I am reading a nother one of her books called Don't look Behind You and so far that is really good. I loved this book alot, but I have read better. If you don't want your great read of this book ruined do not read the Epilogue, because that really ruined the book. I am now dredding the ending of this book might be the same way, which is very stupid."
3,Not memorable,"This book by Lois Duncan disappointed me. After reading some of her other brilliant books, such as Stranger With My Face, it was a letdown. The story is about a girl called Nancy with special psychic powers, given to her by her dying grandmother when she was a child, and what happens to her and her sister and brother. The story seemed too young and simple for me, and with her other books, I thought could be enjoyed by almost any age. I also have read them over and over again. This is an okay book, but compared to her others, it falls flat. Read it, forget about it."
3,Dreams and fulfillment,"A Gift of Magic is in no way Duncan's best work. This one is different from her others in the fact that I found it more suited to children. ""Gift"" is a magical fairy tale that only briefly touches on the trademark Mysterious Phenomena of Duncan's style. It has a simple storyline, simple characters, and a simple structuring. Good for storytelling to younger kids, but not for the usual audience."
3,Not top quality,"It' is a good holder with accented black rim. However, the silver part is a bit thin and the material does not look top quality.I have a black SUV with lots of chrome and the product does not stand out nor add a personal touch to it. Especially when the license plate is white."
4,MINI Style,This two-tone frame matches the stock MINI (2002-2007) taillight treatment almost exactly. My first frame lasted about four years before the black part started to fade to grey. I will wax this new one more often in hopes that it will last longer.
5,A classical Bolger boat book with a wide remit,"Phil Bolger is a favourite of mine. His writing is clear and direct, and this collection of 100 assorted rigs is no exception.His knowledge of these rigs comes in the main from direct experience, and this adds greatly to the value of the book.The illustrations have just enough detail to make plain the unique nature of a given rig, and there is much for newcomer and experienced sailor alike.So why only 9 out of 10?For me this book is fine, but it does not quite achieve the seductive power of his boat design books.Well worth adding to your library."
5,"Historical, musical, and unique","Libre gathers the top musicians as evidenced by their work outside of the Conjunto. Together they are a ""smoking"" Montuno/Jazzie band"
5,The stars are yours Sandra!,"I've been a Guano Apes fan since 1997, when I used to live in Europe. A couple of weeks ago, I paid about [price].-(import) for their latest album ""Don't give me names"", and I don't regret it! As with their first album, I got adicted after listening to it for a day. Sandra Nasic and her band members give rock a hole new meaning."
3,christian/country music,"I like the first two songs on this cd mostly because they were on the radio when I was growing up, but most of this cd falls too close to a country sound for my tastes."
1,Should've been named Beginners guide to interactive fiction,"This book is in no way a guide to game design, nor is it a guide for developers. The author is a writer, not a designer. He spends fifty percent of the book discussing how to produce documents, thirty percent of the book with interviews, ten percent of the book on ADVERTISING (exagerated a little here, but it does contain what is essentially an advertisement for Diablo II as well as discussions of products the author has never even used), and ten percent on the future of games.There is NOTHING worthwhile about this book if you are trying to learn Intermediate to Advanced (on the back of the book) techniques for designing games.You'll learn more about designing games by playing them and paying attention to how the game works.However, if you want to learn about interactive fiction and writing scripts for games, this book is for you."
2,Weak.,"Read this if you've got nothing else to do. Avoid this one, and jump over to Rollings' ""Game Architecture and Design"" for the first book you should have on your shelf."
1,Very basic attempt at explaining computer game design...,"This book did not add much to the theory of game design. A majority of the book was concerned with the scripting of a game like that of a movie, which is unfortunately not how a majority of games are made. I would not suggest this book to the majority of people interested in game design, or to those people current designing games. It really has very little to help with or add."
1,It hurt to read it...,"Ouch!One previous reviewer said ""The author is a writer, not a designer.""That gave Mr. Lewinski too much credit as a writer.I've never seen so many passive, preposition-laden, clich√©-ridden, hyperbole-loaded sentences!It really hurt my head to read this stuff.Despite the title, the book is not for Developers.Its title should have been:""A Total Beginner's Guide To Computer Game Design""..."
1,not recommended,"the only way in which this book is *about* computer game design is in how it circles about the topic, never actually hitting anything in its path. it provides great examples of success stories (and a few mediocre ones as well), but it's little more than an edited collection of product reviews and conversations with designers. all in all, it appears to be written for someone needing a very high-level introduction to the topic - most definitely not a ""developer's guide""."
1,Stay away from this one!,"A bunch of interviews (the first one is with an author of a supermarket food hygiene multimedia!), demagogical phrases, medieval articles and reviews of software for Hollywood screenwriters. When the author wrote this ""book"", he was in the industry for only two years! Very disappointed!"
2,Buy the file folders and toss them to get labels,"The pricing for labels is insane. Go to Costco, but a box of folders (which include 50 labels) and throw the folders in the trash. Its about $8 cheaper than buying two packages of labels. Of course its deadly to the environment and land fills, but thats corporate greed for you.Its very easy to print your own labels without a template. Just do insert table in any word process, adjust you row and column sizes so they print labels of the correct size, and then fill in the table rows with your label text.You can adjust the text size to make very impressive labels, and always fit everything you need on the label. Cut your labels out by hand - it takes about a minute to do a full page of them - and you can create (depending on your printer) full color high resolution labels.If you need a word processor, try openoffice or libreoffice. They are both FREE office suites from Linux that have been converted to run on mac and windows as well./LenWT6G"
5,Great book!,"This book was beautiful. Wonderful characters. This is a story of queen Marwen, who escapes a horrible kidnapping in a god-and-violence-dominated land, with the help of her best friend, an amazonian-type of girl, and minstrel, Kiri. Marwen is very young, but very wise. She must trust in her goddess, Jana, to guide her, and stand strong against her male-dominated senate to create a new Kamilan.At last a Goddess queen can stand strong in her power without a tragic ending befalling her. Thank you Marie Jakober for not making Marwen's story TOO tragic or too predictable.I would so love to see a sequel to this book!"
2,"Good historical context, poor insight into Dix's inner life","Though Brown doesn't over-dramatize it (indeed, he doesn't dramatize it much at all), Dorothea Dix lived one of the most extraordinary lives in the 19th century, one that included the Boston Unitarian intelligentia during the 1820s and 30s, state politics in most state capitols throughout the North and South during the 40s and 50s, Washington, DC, and friendships with senators and presidents, the worst of the Civil War (when she headed up the women nursuing corps for the Union Army) . . . and then there were the insane. Brown is good, if dry and lapidary, on the exterior movement of her career. And he's good at the political context for her career. Yet, as other reviers noticed, his book is really a life and times, with emphasis on ""times,"" not a nuanced and graceful biography. He never gets inside Dix's head, which leaves one feeling disappointed."
5,Incredible Difference in Handling,Wow! My car had become unsafe to drive at freeway speeds. It swayed back and forth. Felt like I would lose control. I had these two front struts installed and the car's handling is just tremendous now. Thank you!
5,Rebecca St James at her best!,"I owned this before on CD a couple of times, and each time lost it over the years. While certainly a classic in it's own right, this album is in my opinion one of Rebecca St James's best albums. There is a lot going on in this album, but everything, and I mean everything sounds fantastic. The message is clear! While I feel this album was a little underrated, I openly recommend at the very least listing to a couple of tracks. I bought the album shortly after I first heard ""god"" and as powerful and fitting as the song was, the rest of album follows closely with more great music. As a progressive rock fan, An ear for for mistakes (and not), A critic of even the best produced music, I find this album was produced quite well, for what it is. I was impressed just from that stand point. All things considered I can fully recommend this album."
3,It was all right.......,"Way to heavy rock and most songs sound the same. If you are like me and can't stand rock n roll don't make the same mistake I did. Go and Sin no more is a definite 5 stars, though."
2,not for anyone over 40,This cd is just so so pop to me. I think it would be enjoyable to people aged 11-37 years old. If your over 4o your better off buying a cd of Twila Paris or Keith Green(both of them sing better than Rebecca in my opinion) but Rebecca does sing songs about God which are biblical and wonderful. But I would recomend this cd for fans of Melissa Etridge and Kiss (but not for those who dislike loud hard rock}
5,!!!AWESOME!!!!,I first heard RSJ perform live at the Inside/Out Soul Fest. At Loon Mountain N.H. July 98. She was an inspiration and help fed my soul the word!!
4,Daughter enjoyed it,"My daughter loves her baby stella doll and this bath set seemed like a fun addition to her play time. Bath seems like an okay fit for the doll, robe fits fairly well, but baby stella is slightly wide around the middle so a lot of the clothing, even the stuff designed for her, fit tight there. Fun toy."
4,"Cute bathtub, just a little small","This bathtub is a really cute addition to your Baby Stella gear. I just wish it was a little bit bigger so Baby Stella could lie down in the tub, but I guess my kids sit up in the bath, so it doesn't really matter. The size does not affect the fun, as you can pretent to wash the doll, she can play with her rubber duckie, and put the bathrobe on afterwards. Great toy!"
3,needs more,"My granddaughter used this immediately, but, wondered where her baby's washcloth and towel were. Just would have been nice to have it a part of this. And, yes, I did just use my own."
3,Manhattan Toy Bath Set for Baby Stella,The set is cute; but the quality is cheap looking. Do not know how long it will last with little ones. Would not purchase again.
5,A wonderful movie!,"I first saw The Anatomy of Love at a premiere in the summer of 2010. This movie is great! The characters have the ability to draw you in and make you feel as if you really know them. The storyline was amazing, its definitely not predictable and at times had me on the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next. All in all, The Anatomy of Love was a superb film and I can't wait until I receive my DVD so I can watch it again and again!"
5,Loved it!!,"This movie was fun to watch, a classic romance story of how the search for love can be closer than you actually thought a definite MUST SEE!!!!"
5,"Loved, Loved, Loved this movie!","I typically am not a fan of romantic comedies. The story is always the same; girl meets boy, girl chases boy, girl and boy fall in love the end. This movie offers a twist to the traditional romantic comedies I have seen. I really enjoyed the directors approach in dealing with romances when it comes to the urban community. The movie kept my attention the entire time and I really felt connected to the characters. This movie will make you laugh, it's an all around feel good movie. I was shocked to see how great the quality of the movie was and the excellent cinematography used for an independent film. I actually liked it just as much, if not better, than some of the few urban romance comedies released such as: Brown Sugar, The Wood, Boomerang, etc. If you are looking for a great movie, one the entire family can enjoy, this is the movie to own!"
2,This book is so-so,"I agree with the previous reviewer. This book is mediocre. Dates are inconsistent (see page 305). The book is all over the place. So many times I had to go back pages to make sense of the authors cronolgical order. If you can stand the frustration, I recommend this book only because there are stories on the lesser known serial killers that did not make the famous grade."
4,Live Joke,The playing is superb as one would expect from Killing Joke live. I saw them back in the 80's in Geneva and they were fantastic. They apparently still are as we can hear here. The only problem is the slightly murky mix shich would have benefitted from more clarity. Anyway it is very good. They play with incredible energy.
5,Awesome Algebra Resource!,"What's awesome about this workbook? The problems. The combination of problems. The way you have several skills on one worksheet - ends up saving paper and shows development of concepts. Some skills have very interesting types of problems that aren't in the Algebra textbook my school provides. This textbook remains my absolute favorite Algebra 1 resource. I'm not quite as fond of its Algebra 2 counterpart, but I use that workbook too. In my opinion, the only difficulty with this workbook is that it doesn't have an answer key. Of course anyone worth their Algebra salt can easily work the problems out, sometimes it's helpful when time is short to have a key handy. I thought the answers might be in the TE, but I don't see them in mine. Hmm."
2,Too Minimal,I dislike workbooks that pack so many problems on the page that it is impossible for students to have enough space to complete the problems - it just defeats the purpose of having a workbook. I also dislike that the skills practice and review is in different sections of the booklet. I do not find it very intuitive to use in planning lessons.
4,"""My Disco Needs Me!!""","Aside from the album version, Pt. 2 includes the Halo mix (8:01) and other songs, ""Ocean Blue"" and ""Your Disco Needs You"", Almighty Mix (8:22). There are very little vocals on the Halo mix. It airs mostly ambient sounds, making this version very trance. The best track in this CD single is the remix of ""Your Disco Needs You"" which includes vocals of Robbie Williams(?), so Village People!! This remix makes it into the all-time ""ANTHEM"" list. As a supplement to Pt. 1, this caps the comeback of Kylie Minogue."
4,fun at the start,"This toy is fun at the start. The graphics are pretty good. first you start out with tyson, but you can use other people by putting in passwords from http://www.hasbro.com/beyblade/.I think that 50 dollars is a lot for this game, so buy it when the price is lower, like I did.Here are some passwords to unlock new players(write these down)010193809044751828642173700121437581821094241697830027392405594330139526926021that is a lot isn't it? well you don't need to thank me"
3,needs a tv,"I didn't realize that you need a tv for this toy, and we don't have a tv. At least it didn't cost too much (on sale), so we didn't lose very much money on it."
3,I have mixed feelings about this book...,"On the one hand, it was very well-written, with fairly smooth transitions between several different formats of the story and various perspectives. And the premise was so hooking, but I guess my main problem was that the book went a direction that I had not expected. I kept thinking that it would be more about Rebecca's childhood, the shoebox... I really expected more closure on that storyline. And I did not think that her relationship with Joe would or Adam would turn out the way that they did. I just wanted something more. Though I did think that the grief, which was the main theme of the entire book, was very well done. I guess I mostly just wanted this to be a different type of book altogether - one that was less about Style and Structure, and more about Story."
5,Wonderful!!!,"I was very undecided about which machine to purchase, but all the reviews seemed to point to this one. I was not disappointed!!! True, no timer but I was warned ahead of time, besides you adjust the time based on what type of milk you use anyway and how tart you like it to taste. It is very easy to use. I love the individual containers. I eat yogurt every day, and this makes it so easy and inexpensive, plus I know exactly what is in it. My 2 year old loves to eat it too!!! My favorite way is with a spoonful of Nutella! Try it, you'll love it!!"
2,Not a necessity,"I ordered this product to streamline my home yogurt making process. The price and glass jars enticed me. In the end, I can do the same in a larger quantity using my crock pot or stove top. This product does the job of keeping the correct temperature over a long duration. What the product lacks is a timer. I also still had to scald the milk on my own and let it cool, mix, and then jar. If you're going to do home yogurt making I think you can save the money on this product."
2,Shuts off too soon!,"The first couple times I used this machine it worked great. Now, now matter how I set the timer, it shuts off after three hours and I have to start it again. So I have to babysit it and can't set it to ""cook"" overnight. If I am doing something wrong, I can't figure our what it is. The yogurt is great when it's done. I am going to write the company. Maybe I just have a lemon."
4,Nice little yogurt maker,"I like this yogurt maker. It does everything that it promises to do. Part of me wished I'd gone another route than the little jars as they are small servings and I would like to be able to make more than a quart at a time, but it does make very good yogurt and the jars are not hard to clean."
3,Euro Cuisine YM80 Yogurt Maker,"I found the time for yoghurt to set is around 3 hours. First few times when I kept it for 6- 8 hours as was recommended, the yoghurt was more watery. Keeping it longer perhaps due to continuous higher temperature, the yoghurt becomes watery. Secondly I experimented replacing the glass jars by stainless steel single jar(which could fit in the yoghurt maker). It works well both with single large jar(of glass or stainless steel)that can fit inside the yoghurt maker. You can get suitable glass jars at Walmart at much lower price than additional jars from Amazon. Also cleaning single big jar (glass or stainless steel) is much less botheration than handling seven jars."
3,wrong model number,"It shows on the picture as Model: YM100, but in the description it says Model: YM80 - this one is without timer and usually about $10 less."
5,Great and Inexpensive,I've had this yogurt maker for 4 months now and I love it. I don't find the lack of a timer to be an issue. A great recipe that I am using is 2 cans of fat free evaporated milk and 1 can of water plus 1/2 cup of powdered milk. Place mixture and sausepan and heat until milk gets hot but not boiling. Stir well and remove from heat and add 4 oz. of activia vanilla yogurt. Allow to dissolve well and place in yogurt maker jars for 9-10 hours. My whole family loves it with local honey added just before serving. Highly recommended. My daughter even plans on buying one for herself she loves it so much.
1,temp goes up way too high,"I've been using this about 3 month, and trying to figure it out why my yogurt come out curdish. Then I noticed that the temp goes up to around 130F.I tried altering by adding water, putting thinner pads, but the product is simply not good."
4,love it,"I bought this five months ago and I love it! I have only made one bad batch of yogurt, and that was because I forgot and put the lids on the jars while the yogurt was warming (you have to leave them off until it's done). It makes the most delicious whole-milk yogurt (especially with vanilla!) and very good skim milk yogurt - if you want it VERY THICK it takes a bit of work, adding powdered nonfat milk and all that, but you can also cut down on time by boiling your milk in the microwave!The jars are lovely and VERY sturdy. I don't advocate bouncing them off the walls or anything, but I have dropped one quite hard and it didn't crack or chip, which is nice.I would give this 5 stars if it had an automatic shutoff/timer. Really it just has numbers on the side and you line an arrow up with the number for the time you're supposed to turn it off. Don't make yogurt in the evening, you'll have to get up at 2am and put it in the fridge!"
4,It works; can't find the timer; don't use fresh fruit,"If you follow the instructions, you'll make yogurt.There's supposed to be a timer somewhere on this device. But Ihave no idea where. It doesn't really matter though, becausewhen it's done, you have to put it in the fridge.I don't recommend using fresh fruit, even if you microwave it tosterelize it. The results are watery, I think because freshfruit has so much liquid in it (at least in the case of strawberries)."
1,Stay away from this item,"This is such a cute unit. When I received it I couldn't wait to use it. Imagine my horror as I unwrapped it and discovered that most of the unit is made of #7 plastic, today considered a safety hazard as it will release toxic BPA into your food. #7 Baby bottles are being outlawed slowly (in most civilized countries) and many US companies have already stopped using #7 plastics. I was happy this unit came with glass jars. But the lids are #7 and the cover to the unit is also #7 which means that as it is heating up and breeding my yogurt it may well be infusing some BPA in as well. And the more you use it, the higher the risk. With use and if it ever scratches, you are literally cooked. No thank you. I have returned it."
5,"Great yogurt, mine does have a timer","I've been using this yogurt maker for about six months now with great results. The steps are: heat milk, cool milk, mix with either yogurt starter OR just some store bought yogurt, set the timer and away you go. You can use whole, skim or low-fat milk. There are instructions included for adding fruit/flavorings; but I'm lazy about it and simply add that stuff after my yogurt is made and avoid the extra steps involved.Some reviews complained about the lack of a timer--maybe an older product lacked a timer (?) The one I have, purchased in May '06, has a dial/timer you set for the number of hours you need to warm the yogurt (there's no way to miss it). The machine turns off automatically once the time is achieved--so I don't worry about over-warming.Wonderful product, at least so far!"
2,"Good initially, but...","Upon first receiving this product, I LOVED it. There is just NOTHING like the taste of fresh homemade yogurt. However, as I continued to use it, I had to start increasing the cook time to get the set I wanted, and now my product is not satisfactory.So, if you're looking to see if yogurt making is for you and you'd like a reasonably inexpensive first outing, I can certainly recommend; as I said, at first the yogurt was amazing. But if it's a quality product you're looking for that will give you years of use, I would suggest looking elsewhere."
3,Mixed review,"The yogurt maker looks nice with high quality jars but the instructions for making yogurt were all screwed up. Since this is my third yogurt maker, I went back to previous instructions with acceptable results."
3,Made my first batch,I m new in it.First batch did ot turn out right.Whished they had a better receipe with it. Is there suppose to be whey on the bottom?I give it a try again
1,soupy yogurt,"Euro Cuisine YM100 Automatic Yogurt Maker I don't like the machine. The yogurt is very soupy, no matter how long I leave it in there. Very disapointed."
3,Euro Cuisins Yogurt Maker,"I purchased this for my daughter as a Christmas gift so I don't know too much about it, but she wanted one so I bought it. It looks like it's made well and I'm sure she will enjoy it."
5,Why complicate matters with all those small cups?,"This yogurt maker makes great yogurt. My only complaint is the cleaning of seven small cups. If you want to make one large batch of yogurt instead of seven small batches, just buy a 7-cup glass bowl, either from Anchor Hocking or from Corning (Pyrex), and use it in place of the seven small cups. The glass bowl fits nicely underneath the lid of the yogurt maker. I found the 7-cup Pyrex bowl at Kmart for $6 but you can order the Anchor Hocking here at Amazon if you want:Anchor Hocking TrueSeal Glass Storage Container - Round - 7 cups"
3,3 starts because there is no timer on it!!!,"I've tried it once with the Girmi packet, and it worked fine, but the unit has NO timer like in the picture!"
3,Not quite what it appears to be,"The write-up says an Italian company produces it. Well, that may be true, but the label on the bottom says ""Made in China."" There's a pretty little row of numbers that presumably let you set a timer of up to 12 hours, as a reminder. Oh, by the way--it's not really a timer. If it ever reaches zero, it won't shut off the machine. Anyway, it's just a row of numbers pasted on the side of the machine. You set the ""timing device"" by lining up a mark on the lid--that's right, the lid--with the appropriate number, say, 6 hours. This thing is WAAAAAY overpriced, it should be only $12.95.Other than that, it's a good little machine. It's efficient, keeps the yogurt warm, and as the other reviewer said, the glass jars are way cool. And since I love round things, I will definitely keep this. But it's overpriced."
4,Average product,"Using this for 3 months now. Quality is good. But jars are USELESS, very difficult to clean. Otherwise curd is well formed. shape of cover is weird, can't understand its logic."
5,Amazing,This yogurt maker product is wonderful!! I am glad I purchased it. I can make now my own yogurt. Super healthy and very easy to make.
4,A good purchase...,The device works as expected. The only minor downside is the need to plug it on a timer if you want it on for a specific amount of time. But making the yogurts during the night is also a valid option. Go for it.
3,Absolutely no timer!,The machine I received had no timer capability what so ever. It worked otherwise but I wish they didn't mention the timer if it doesn't have it.
3,I don't really care for this product,"I purchased this yogurt maker to go along with the Specific Carbohydrate Diet as outlined in the book Breaking the Vicious Cycle. On the diet, you have to eat yogurt daily to replenish the good bacteria in your system. The yogurt needs to cook between 100 and 110 degrees to get the best benefit from the yogurt. The yogurt maker I purchased cooks the yogurt at 130+. I purchased a dimmer switch from Home Depot and it now cooks at the correct temp. If you are purchasing a yogurt maker and plan to eat a lot of yogurt, I would not suggest this one. If you are purchasing it for the SCD diet, I would suggest getting a dehydrator (Excalibur) where you can set the temp and cook a lot of yogurt at once. I'm currently saving for a dehydrator because you can do so much more than just make yogurt with it. Overall, this product does what it's supposed to do and it does it well. It just doesn't meet my needs for a lot of yogurt. I am currently making yogurt every 3 days."
1,be careful with lids!,Instructions were to wash lids and jars before use. Every lid warped in the hot water and now cannot be placed on jars.
3,"Great Product, wasteful bottles","This yogurt maker is easy to use, and makes great yogurt. The bottles are a true pain in the neck to use as they should not have those shoulders that make it so hard to get the yogurt out. A straight design would give this product five stars!"
3,Where's the featured timer?,"I expected the product to be equiped with a timer - a feature I desired. Although that was a disappointment, it makes very good yogurt IF the dry milk is used and it's allowed to process overnight,. We enjoy the heavier weight yogurt product."
4,Makes great yogurt,I am happy with this yogurt maker. It works well. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is I didn't think the manual gave enough info. I really like that I can use either a glass bowl or the individual jars.
3,Product Received Was Not Product in Photo,"My only complaint is the misleading product image. I wanted the machine that had the timer and automatic shut off - just like the picture shows but received a machine with only an on-off switch. The description, that I did read before purchasing, is misleading too. I bought this for my elderly Mother to replace a machine she owned for over 30 years. She does report that the machine works well and has no complaints about the quality of the yogurt it makes."
3,Not the one I purchased,I purchased the yogurt maker but received a different model. I know that I purchased one with a timer. This has happened to me before on Amazon.Other than that it is ok. I ordered the extra rack but I do not recommend the extra rack as the top tier does not get quite hot enough.
4,Euro Cuisine YM80 Yogurt maker - easy fun,"This basic unit is easy to use, and the recipes in the included book are better than those in cook books I read in the library. I liked that I can enhance the unit by purchasing more jars and a double decker insert. I bought this particular model because others in my office have had great success with it too! But it sure is hard to find the right yogurt starter. I wished they would include a small yogurt strainer to make Greek yogurt; Or at least sell a yogurt strainer with a recipe for Greek yogurt."
4,Basics of Japanese theater,"I purchased this book for a Japanese theater class. From this book I learned a lot about Noh, Kabuki, and Joruri theater. This book gives the ""scripts"" of the plays and also some literary critiques and history of the play. It was interesting to see the different types of plays that the Japanese have. This book does not cover modern Japanese theater, like the Suzuki method, so if you are interested in that then get a different book."
5,Great Shopping Experience,This platter was exactly as described. It was shipped promptly and in excellent condition and the price was the lowest I could find. Thank you.
1,Foot killers,"ECCO Men's Casual Cool Hydromax Golf ShoeThe least stable, most uncomfortable golf shoes I have ever worn. I had high expectations from ECCO but was severely disappointed."
4,Overall good buy,"This shoe is comfortable. I walk when I play and this shoe does the job well; no aches and pains. The laces look too far apart and you want to tighten them to get them closer together, but that's how the shoe is built. European sizing makes them a bit bigger, but no problem there. Over all a good buy. I also have a pair of Footjoys and Nikes TW and I use the Eccos most."
2,not really all that good,Thought it would be like the bull worker thing. But its not and you reach maximum intensity pretty soon. Not useful at all for building mass.
1,Skip It,"Even if yours doesn't break, it is awkward to use and not nearly as versatile as a plain resistance band."
3,Not too bad for low intensity,"I think if you don't use this with Rambo-like intensity, it will work for. The pictures do not match the text in the pamphlet that comes with. The text says to hold it one, but the picture shows something in few places. Video is a little more instructive, but I have yet to find the ""65 exercises"" this thing can do."
1,Broke 1st time it was used...,I thought it would be a great way for my sons to work out at home but it broke the first time it was used - within a few minutes. I wish I had paid attention to the other bad reviews about this problem and saved myself the trouble of having to return it.
4,Must have for Mr. Miracle fans,"I'm a big fan of the original Mister Miracle comic book (I'm a Kirby purist...nobody else drew Barda the way she was supposed to be drawn!) so when I saw these I thought, ""Wow,that would look cool as a decoration for my computer table"" (really geeky,I know) Barda's face isn't as close to the original as I'd like it but all in all they're great representations of what I consider to be Jack Kirby's finest hour of creativity.And Big Barda stands taller than Scott Free....even without the helmet!.A couple of gripes though...display stands would have been great...they don't balance too well on their own or with the ""aero discs"".And no mention of Kirby in the packaging...it's a crime to forget their original creator.I know D.C. owns the characters now and has used them with different writers and artists for longer than the tragically short time Kirby was in control of them...but he really should have been mentioned somewhere on the box...he was the man!"
2,just baffling,"this dictionary has good contemporary definitions. it has, however, one glaringly strange oversight:English-to-Italian has phonetical marks for the English word while the Italian-to-English does not show pronunciation for the Italian word.How is this possible?page X11 of the index shows pesca and pesche with phonetic transcription. If you look this word up in the dictionary there too there are phonetical marks. Page around the Italian section a bit more and notice no other truely Italian words have phonetical marks. Then notice on page 75 that bypass and byte have the English pronunciation. Now look in the English section and notice that the English words all have phonetical transcription. I bought this book in the USA. I already speak a de English for God's sake."
5,Om-azing,"This album was probably the first jazz album i ever heard while in university. After hearing it I wanted to be a musician, listen to jazz constantly, and buy every Coltrane album. Granted it is not anything like Coltrane and Johnny Hartman, which I also love. But if you want experimental spiritual jazz that pushes the boundaries far beyond where Ornette's intellectualizing goes, this is it. This is not an album that my wife would call 'dinner music'. But it is an important album in the sense that it shows just how far out a musician can go. This is music for musicians, not pedestrians."
3,OM: real acid jazz?,"i'm not sure what to say about this album. the story goes that John Coltrane recorded this high on LSD. the results are scattershot, but there are moments of genius. but there is also alot of meddling around and it just does not gel like it should. which can be expected if that acid story is true, right? Coltrane did not want this album to be put out; and it's a shame that right after he died, the record company immedietly released it. i don't have much of an opinion on OM. i very rarely listen to it. i suppose it does make an interesting historical document, but certainly not an essential one."
1,Best used for Pyschological Warfare,"This album (in my opinion) is the worst of John's career. I bought it back around 1977 as I was just beginning to explore jazz and John Coltrane. What a mistake! My roomate at the time (a jock at a progressive radio station) threatened me with grave bodily harm if I ever played it again in his presence.Anyone who has actually listened to this album (on purpose or by mistake) will know why the manufacturer no longer offers this title in it's catalog. Likewise, it's not hard to understand why Eric Nisenson, author of ""Ascension: John Coltrane and His Quest"", suggested that it was recorded ""while the entire band was tripping on LSD"". It truely falls in the weapon of mass destruction category."
4,"pretantious, but still hillarius","I think ""Om"" is one of my favorite original Coltrane albums. The piano playing by Mcoy Tyner is absolutely marvelous. Listening to ""Om"" is like taking a rollercoaster ride straight up to the sky, and then land as safetly as one can in the end. Its better than ""Ascension"" at least."
1,avoid like the plague!,"i absolutely love recordings such as ""a love supreme"" and ""expression"", but this i just don't get. only if you are a coltrane collector and need this to complete your 'impulse years' titles should you even consider this one. it's noise, plain and simple."
5,beautiful music,"Gatecrasher has some of the best trance music i have ever heard. Its beautiful music, especially Dreaming by BT....very VERY GOOD! You must get this if you love trance."
3,Not the best,"I love trance, house, and many other types of dance music, but this is not a complete compilation. It's missing a certain theme or mood besides the obvious progressive trance. I'm actually listening to it right now and it is worth getting if you can burn it or get it at a cheaper price. Whenever you put this cd on you won't know which song you're on because many sound the same. There are some that stand out and that is why I like it, but there are too many fillers."
4,"Good CD, can get old.","This is a great compilation album, and has some amazing anthems on it. My only concern is its ability to get old after awhile. Unlike some of my other complilations, it fails to keep me going if I have heard it once before.but judge for yourself..."
3,what happened to the music,"This could not be Gatecrasher. Compared to Discotech and Immerse yourself this is very disappointing. When I first got the album I could not wait to get it home. My first reaction when listening to the first four tunes was that it sounded boreing. There are some very good tunes on it, like Delerium with the haunting voice of Sarah Mc lachlin and Paul Van Dyk's love from above to name but a few. But generally the whole album just do'es not get you there, unlike the albums before it. If you are looking for a good trance album I would listen to paul van dyk,s Out There And Back as it follows the old Gatecracher style, which is without a doubt, better."
3,Not even the same class,"This compilation has lost that feeling, so to speak. Most of the tracks are good tracks, but there is no feeling behind it. Gatecrasher became known for its incredible parties and banging music. This comilation lost that somewhere. The previous compilations had a strong beat and popular club songs. There are only a few of these on this mix. If your looking for the same type of party compilation that the red, black, wet, discotech compilations were, your looking in the wrong place. However, if you like a little more laid back style or are a die hard gatecrasher fan you should still pick this up."
4,One Size Fits All,Beer and BBQ over the summer put some pounds on my already stout frame. This (except the upper pants) fit very well. it was a little...accentuating of my...area but otherwise great.
5,wonderful short summery.... as it says...really useful optics...,I love this book! it is not a book to start learning from it but as a graduate student i go back to remember some basics and useful optics... i have to admit i use it a lot and i am glad that i found it... it is sad that the author dies before publishing it but i want to thank soooo much his friend that actually finished the job... thank you!
2,"More like ""Useless Optics.""","This skinny, expensive hardcover book only scratches the surface of anything even close to useful. Sixteen chapters, 129 pages. The ""geometrical optics"" chapter is three (!) pages short. If you're going to get a Welford book, don't make it this one. His ""Aberrations of Optical Systems"" is much better (and more expensive), but I'm not putting that one down for a good place to invest your dough. The most useful optics book is ""Modern Optical Engineering"" by Warren Smith. The Rudolf Kingslake books are also very good, depending, of course, on what, exactly, you're looking for. I'd give ""Useful Optics"" one star if I found something wrong in it (not that I've been looking)."
2,"I was very disappointed with this fashion film, there's little fashion in it","This was a film I wanted to return immediately after viewing it. It has so littlefashion shown in it that made me terribly disappointed. The gentleman it isshowcasing is of no current interest. Sorry, but this one is a definitely ""No."""
2,Loved the first one...,"I read ""Tales of the City"" the way a dog reads a bone. I devoured the book in a single sitting and then began a frantic search for my car keys so I could buy the next installment. I love the first three, like the fourth, tolerated the fifth, hated the sixth. The final book seems intent on destroying the magic the earlier books created. Partly it's because the story and characters didn't do what I wanted them to do, but mostly because Maupin seems to have developed a hatred for some of these characters. It's like listening to someone bad mouth your family. I re-read the first three all the time. I'll never read the sixth one again."
1,Extremely high sodium - TOO SALTY,"OMG, I thought my blood pressure would hit the walls of my artery and instantly kill me after eating just one papadum. This food needs to be repackaged to contain less sodium content. It currently has 620 mg and the daily sodium intake is 2300 mg. So who can eat just one papadum w/o going over their sodium requirement! WARNING: If you have high blood pressure or hypertension, do NOT buy this product ... you will be killing yourself!!"
3,WELL IT HAD TO HAPPEN...........,"You can't be perfect,But you can at least try!I love this show but to pick the shorts they did really did injustice to the show.Everyone has their good days and bad,But they seem to be showing the worst of the bad.While I do like four of the seven I just think the weaker ones really bring the entire tape down.If they had included Mr.B Natural it would have elevated the tape to five stars,BUT HEY!IT'S MST3K SO BUY THE TAPE ANYWAY!!"
3,Toned down,"The original 212 is a great cologne for a night out or even to wear as a casual everyday fragrance. 212 Sexy, unfortunately, is the weaker brother of the original 212. The strong, sharp initial notes that you're hit with when you put on 212 are muted and toned down with 212 sexy. This version is smooth and powdery but doesn't last long (2-4 hours max). For me personally, it isn't worth purchasing. My recommendation is the original 212 if you enjoy this type of blend."
1,Nothing yet,I still haven't received any product from you. Please get back to me so we can figure out what to do. Thanks
3,"For some, it might be ideal","For me, the neck opening is too small. This results in a somewhat staid appearance, on me at least. I also found the material to be a bit on the thin side.Other than that, it's a good sweater. For some reason, I can't seem to find a sweater vest that really suits me. So this one had to do."
4,Good snack,"These are a pretty good snack. Most of the adults and kids in my family like them. However, both my son and I find them almost impossible to eat without milk. So for us, they don't make a good on the go snack.The other thing is that 64 for pouches is a lot. When we got ours they were marked with an expiration date of 2 months out from the time we got them. There was no way we were going to eat a bag everyday! We ended up offering a pack to just about everyone that walked through our door to keep them from going to waste. So keep in mind when ordering that you need to either like them a lot or have a big family."
5,Great Music!,"I bought this CD several months ago and I am still listening to it over, and over, and over again! I would reccomend this to anyone who likes Christian Rock/Alternative music. Worth every penny. Thanks BTR!"
5,Addictive!,This is fun for the whole family. We have it loaded on 3 computers and we all play! My husband was sucked in as well. The virtual tank is not for everyone... you have to feed your fish almost daily. This is great in teaching the kids to be responsible. You DO NOT have to set up the virtual tank. Everyone can have their own profile. Great graphics and variety of play.
3,clicking frenzy,My grandchildren are better at this game than I am. The object of the game is to get your fish to eat other fish without being eaten. You have to do a lot of mouse clicking to get the fish to eat and to be kept from being eaten. My grandchildren love it but I am not to big of a fan I get tired of being eaten. It's ok.
5,Fantastic!,"In a word... fantastic! This book has it all. It is a love story with drama, a little mystery, a little suspense, and a surprise ending you'd never expect. The story is well written in language easy to read, like the way you would talk with your friends. I can't wait for the next book!"
2,Fair viewing,"I'm a Doris Day fan, but not for this. The first two seasons are good. She is living on a farm with her two sons and father. Then she moves to the city, the family dissappears, and the rest of the shows are about how everyone falls in love with her, and her trendy modern wardrobe."
5,So convenient !,"I bought this diaper bag when I had my second baby, a couple of months ago and... its amazing ! I wasn't so sure at first because I thought it looked small (there's A LOT of stuff to carry, with two babies under two !)... but NO ! First of all, I have plenty of space (with many compartments)and the straps ""system"" works real well (and it fits my maclaren double stroller!) It is soooo convenient, when walking around with the stroller... then having to switch quickly to a ""regular"" bag, when putting the stroller away. Plus, its height when hanging on the stroller, combined with the bag's fabric, makes it very easy to take stuff out of there. It is not cheap, of course, but well worth the money (and I had tried many diaper bags, before this one, ..). One last thing, as a bag (& purse) lover: IT LOOKS SO GREAT !"
2,You get what you pay for,"I've had mine for about 4 months now and its still very nice looking BUT previous reviewers remarked on how the handle was loose and had a bit ""play"" when turning the knob left then right (or right then left) and I am experiencing the same problem. It feels loose for about a 3/4"" turn before catching and adjusting the water temperature accordingly but it still works and was about half the price than buying an actual Delta replacement. So you decide whether this will be too much of an annoyance to you or if it would be more important to just spend the extra $$$."
3,"ok, but received damaged","Product worked fine, but handle had a slight crack. There was no visible damage to the shipping box, or the product packaging, so it must have been packed that way, which doesn't say much for quality control. But I figured since it was for master bedroom shower, nobody's gonna see it but me and the wife, so I didn't bother with returning."
2,NOT large print as ordered!,"I ordered this book for my father after searching for 'large print books'. however, now that the order is received I realize this book is NOT large print.Far as my nearly blind father is concerned, this was a waste of money."
2,Not very good at all.,"This project looks like a project that went really bad. This could have very well been Aaron & Jeoffrey first album and then they somehow got better, but this was the last album as of 1997. Good thing I did not spend as much money for it. :)"
1,Seeds did not germinate,"Started seeds indoors. They did not germinate so I'm a bit disappointed. Also tried directly sowing the seeds outside in the garden, but that didn't work either. Will try again next year."
4,Plesant Surprize,"I ordered this music dvd along with several others. So far this is the best of bunch.I am a long time musician and sound tech,not a guitar player so I was not expecting to be captured by the depth of this concert.I know of Steve Vai's history and work but,his band is amazing as well. Powerful drumming, two violins with two guitarist, keyboards and bass.The songs are very interesting arrangements that showcase the tremendous talent and technical prowess of these excellent players.Even if you have never heard of Vai, this show pulls you in. Watch the bios first.Then when watching the concert you will enjoy it fully.I have a large collection of music dvds from many diverse artists,This one is in my top 5.."
4,Steve Vai Live with the String Theory Band,Excellent performance by Steve and Co. Well filmed with excellent audio. Well worth purchasing. Steve's playing at times in almost incomprehensible with regards to technique and execution.
5,Incredible !!!,"This concert video gives me goosebumps everytime I watch it. Much more than a shredfest. Steve Vai's playing is impecable as well as emotional. The whole band is great and the fun they are having is infectious. It is simply fun to watch and awe inspiring. Thanks Steve, you got me to pick up my axe again."
5,steve wild thing,"steve vai where the wild thing are,is a very exciting dvd the musicians are amazing besides steve vai ann marie calhoun is one of the best violin player i`ve seen if you have to listen to violin music she`ll be the one i`ll listen too she`s georgeous and an extremely talented musician, other than that a very different live dvd vai put together theres even gags on his show , so if your a steve vai fan this should definely be in your collection, amazing"
4,Blu -ray ?!?!?!?!,"Just note....... is a Blu-ray....sort of , but ONLY 720p ,ONLY Dolby Digital(no DTS Master HD audio or the like) and no usual Blu-ray functions ( such as pop up menus over playing video). If you already have the dvd and have gear that 'upscales', DON'T bother buying this version. :)"
5,Stunning!,Steve Vai is a gifted and unique guitar player who plays with passion and creates awesome original musical masterpieces. This is an excellent concert DVD that captures his live showmanship and shows why he is considered one of the best guitar players and entertainers ever. His band is superb and really supports the music with great performances all round. The vision is stunning and the sound is even better. The editing is great because it was done by Vai himself - no quick shots and stupid effects to detract from the performance. I have always loved Vai's work and this DVD just confirms how awesome he is. Highly recommended to Steve Vai fans and fans of virtuoso guitar playing. Up there with the best!
5,Amazing concert!!,"I saw this concert in person, and it was amazing! Owning it on Blu-Ray is a way to never forget the special moment. For those that didn't get to see this concert, it isn't your typical Steve Vai concert. Yes, you have the amazing guitar virtuosity of Steve Vai, but you also get the amazing musicianship of AnneMarie and Alex. The only thing really missing from this concert was Billy Sheehan on bass which for some reason leaves the concert feeling slightly duller than some of the other Vai concerts. The audio quality of this concert on blu-ray is quite amazing having seen the concert in person I can say that they really captured what it was like to be at this show, and brought it home to those that could not attend. All in all if you like Steve Vai this is a must have!"
4,Product is better than average.,"Who ever directed/edited the camera work, was a musician... if not steve himself. the set list was only a blue powder short of perfect. The only other area that annoyed me, was Steve raising his arm seeking an applause after each lick."
2,NO BOX,"Bought this for my wife as she had mentioned that she liked the fragrance, takes a lot away from a fragrance gift when it does not even come in a box. Makes me think it is an immitation or refilled etc."
5,Much better than your average soundtrack,"For being a relative unknown in the U.S., this soundtrack amazes me as it is much better than most of what is made in Hollywood. If you're into smooth melodies (the Titanic Soundtrack comes to mind), then this disk is worth checking out.However, the cost is steep, so if you're thinking about buying the movie, buy the Special Edition box set since this disk comes with."
5,Escaflowne is the best,I fell in love with this anime since it aired on FoxKids.Right when you watch this show or listen to the music emotions fly.I love the opening song for the show.I am still trying to find the opening song.If you know what cd has the opening song please write back on the reviews section and tell me what cd the opening song is on.Thank you!
5,Nice book for OO concepts,This a very nice book to get your fundamentals and concepts of java. Do not expect to learn java syntax. A little bit of programming experience would be very helpful before buying this
1,A Kindle Victim,"An Autumn Sowing may or may not be a good story. You certainly won't find out by attempting to read this atrocious edition. Far beyond a few ""typos"" which one comes to expect with electronic books, this is quite possibly the worst example of eTranscription that I've ever seen. Punctuation has either been replaced by various symbols, or simply thrown out the window altogether. Perhaps the oddest thing of all is that, who/whatever did the transcription couldn't decide if the name of the protagonist family was Keeling, or Reeling. They seem to have flipped a coin whenever the name cropped up, and then hap-hazardously gone with the winner. I found myself wondering if it could be some sort of odd plot device.Benson was a wonderfully entertaining writer, and his work certainly deserves more respect than it's been given here. By all means, find a worthy edition and enjoy this book, but avoid this piece of electronic abortion at all costs!"
5,Great tool at a good price,"I only used the planer for two months when someone stole it from my tool shed. I guess he/she liked it, too!"
4,Informative and easy reading,"This is a very good book, but I am going to stop short of the glowing praise others have given it. While in some respects George Crane's use of descriptive language is excellent, I think it fell short more often than not. Nonetheless, I found the book was paced well, and very informative not only about the Ch'an monks of Inner Mongolia, but of the period in Maoist China known as The Great Leap Forward. The most stunning part of the book I found was the description of Tsung Tsai's exodus from China, particularly his train ride."
3,An Unusual Story,"I bought this book because of several references to it in The Journal Keeper: A Memoir, by Phyllis Theroux. I enjoyed it, and it is a quick read. The monk is a fascinating person and his relationship to the author, whose approach to the world differs significantly from the monk's, is a puzzle. Toward the end of the book, that interaction becomes somewhat tiresome though. I would recommend it for anyone who is interested in Zen Buddhism and looking for an interesting but light read."
3,Good but not great,"This is a great story and it'd make a great movie. Unfortunately, the author and his writing ability are not up to the task and, by the end of the book, I was wishing he'd just shut up and let the monk talk."
2,Too Bad The Monk Didn't Write The Book,"I found the writer, Crane, dying to interpose his bad poetry, bad jokes and whining, obnoxious self into what could have been a thoughtful story about a monk and his religious beliefs. Too bad!"
5,Crane is everyman.,"It is because of the humaness of the author that I found this book particularly fascinating. He is at once a seeker and a self confessed liar. Who of us isn't? I am so dreary of all of these books by those who have all of the answers. Crane, like the rest of us, doesn't even profess to know the questions. How refreshing. For all of us with the spirit of wanderlust and the desire to know things we can't even express, Crane is our very capable guide. May the god of his choice bless him."
5,'Tis a great journey indeed,This book is about true compassion and frendship. It is also the journey of someone who lives in this world but is not of it. It is how this great master can accomplish the seemingly impossible. The imagery is stunning throughout. It also shows how perseverance and devotion can accomplish miracles.
5,Hardest of the Hardcore,"Within the first 54 pages, I cried and laughed harder reading this, more than any other book. The first noble truth of Buddhism is ""life is dukkha"", which translates loosely as suffering. The essence of that, and human perseverence slaps you in the face, and caresses it with compassion, all at the same time. Tsung Tsai told George Crane he would write a book ""like Bible... better than Bible."" He just may be right."
3,Instance of plagerism,"On page 28 Crane writes: ""In English the differences between objects and actions are clearly, if not always logically, distinguished. But a great number of Chinese words do duty for both nouns and verbs--so that one who thinks in Chinese has little difficulty in seeing that objects are also events, that our world is a collection of processes rather than things.""This was one of the more striking sentences in the book to me. Unfortunately, I soon discovered that it was actually written by Alan Watts and used without attribution (from page 5 of the Way of Zen, by Alan Watts, Partheon 1957). Shame shame, George."
2,2 .5 stars,This is perhaps Seaman's worst mix. Some great tracks are here but the mix as a whole does not really work. It starts and ends well (the first 5 and the last 2 are nice) but the whole middle section is boring. those middle tracks are there just for atmosphere; they are really no good by themselves. It is this middle portion that kind of ruins the whole mix. Get Seaman's GUs (both are good) and/or his Renaissance Awakening mix.
2,"same ol, same ol","Any GU/trance/progressive fan will have heard these tracks laid down numerous times on either cd or at the club. It would really get 2.5 stars, but not an option. Of course this is all preference and opinion, but my current taste is a little deeper, house-ier and darker. I like his Buenes Aires Gu a bit better, but again, just too commercial and poppy! Left me wondering why he chose the tracks he did, as this set didn't move me(emotionally speaking) AT ALL. Hope he upgrades on Renaissance Awakening. Much respect given, however, to Dave Seaman who is one of several DJ's that are setting new and higher standards for underground club culture.....just not on this cd!"
2,Outdated and Unimpressive,"I'm still backdating my electronica listening for Renaissance albums mixed by Dave Seaman...all because of his very impressive Desire album. Well I didn't like Awakening and America is even worse. Outdated trance that flows poorly with too many tracks that have me reaching for the skip button. Missed its release? Don't worry, not much worth listening to on this album. Still can't figure out the America theme.2/5 stars"
4,Taking over as the Worlds Best DJ,"I was first introduced to Dave Seaman with his contribution to the Global Underground series. His disc (G.U. 12-Buenos Aires) is the best of the lot. So I decided to check out the rest of his resume. And this was the first disc I found. From start to finish his track selection is excellent. First, he had the intelligence to select not one, but two tracks from the master, BT. Then the second track, which is accompanied by one of the most beautiful female vocals I have heard since Jan Johnston, comes alive and immediately I knew I was in for a great disc. Seaman didn't disappoint, from start to finish this is one of the premier DJ compilations that doesn't have the words Global and Underground on it. I look forward to more releases from DJ Dave Seaman, but in the meantime, you'll have a hard time wrestling this one out of my disc changer..."
2,Not helpful,I felt this book was not at all helpful in creating a Yoga class for children. It didn't give me anything to work with to be creative. Fly Like a butterfly is the best one I have read yet.
3,Not much to do about yoga,"If you are looking for a book to introduce children to yoga asana and yoga theory, this one probably isn't the best choice. The poses are few, and are fairly simple; too simple for elementary children. The strength of the book lies in the group activities and games. The group lessons lean more toward team and trust -building, which would be great in a classroom, church group or camp. As a children's yoga teacher, I was disappointed in the actual yoga content, but I'll keep it as a reference in case I need a filler activity."
3,Decent,I'm much older than your typical Hip Hopper therefore the clean version appeals to me it's good driving music.
2,Keyless remote for 1997 Avalon,"I bought this remote hoping it would mean I could use it to open my car doors from at least some distance away. As it turns out, it doesn't unlock the doors till I'm pushing the button while only about 3 feet from the car. What good is that? I may as well just put the key in the lock! I tried putting a new battery it in, but it didn't help. My recommendation? Don't waste your money on this."
1,Should have bought the OEM,This key FOB did not last very long. About 2 years. The original OEM part lasted about 7.The paint rubbed off the buttons in the first year and one button stopped working the next year.
2,not so great,"I gave this product a shot because it was inexpensive and had good reviews, but I haven't seen a major difference and have been using it for about 2 months consistenly."
1,NOT worth the money - Don't WORK - Reviews raving about it WRONG,Lousy is the only honest word for this product. The pink jell doesn't sink into the pores - it remains wet for a long time. The cream for lower eye is better but does absolutely nothing for small lines. Been using this product for one month. FORGET it. Not a keeper fer sure. It does nothing for puffiness. The gal in the reviews that said she used it for two months is Correct in her evaluation.
4,Opinion of Avon's Force Extra Eye cream,"Avon ANEW Force Extra Eye Cream is a good product, but no better than other eye creams I have used."
2,"worthwhile, but also worth knowing the following","This book will tell you a lot of what you need to know about writing feature articles. But what I didn't know when I purchased it on Amazon was that it's geared toward the AUSTRALIAN market, which he refers to regularly in the book. Also, most of the examples of writing that he provides, the language and cultural references are of Australia, making it a bit harder to follow for a North American English speaker. If you are not interested in writing for the Australian market, you can be better served by another book. One thing that was missing was the lack of attention given to the distinct writing styles for newspapers and magazines. Considering the title is ""how to research and write newspaper and magazine articles,"" one would imagine that the author would address the differences between the two."
5,Great shoes for office workers.,These are great shoes. Really comfortable and cute. I recommend them to all my friends since in NYC we have to walk a lot and still have office-appropriate shoes. Also good areAK Anne Klein Women's Impress FlatAK Anne Klein Women's Impress Flat.
4,Great Shoe!,"This is an attractive, well-fitting casual shoe. I'll say that the cut of the shoe makes them appear pretty wide, so if you have wide feet to begin with, they may not be flattering. However, they are comfortable and durable and I just ordered a second pair in a different color because they are so versatile. These shoes are easy to dress up or down and pair nicely with jeans or skirts."
5,Hi-Dome 10-Inch Pie Pan with Lid,I was delighted with this pie pan. I will be using these pans to bake Raisin Pies for our church functions.
4,COVERED PIE PAN,"THEY WORK FAIRLY WELL. I WOULD PREFER GLASS INSTEAD OF ALUMINUM, BUT THEY WORK OK. YOUR SERVICE WAS EXCELLENT AND DELIVERY WAS ON TIME.THANK YOU.JOHN VALENTINE"
3,pitted pan,"I liked the size of the pan ,but was disappointed with quality .I baked a apple pie in the pan, and after the pie was gone ,I noticed that the pan was pitted"
5,Hard to find item!,A 10 inch pie pan is very hard to find and this pan is excellent. It has the double bottom that assures a evenly browned crust. If you bake pies this should be in your kitchen.
5,Nice,"I got this before Thanksgiving & have used it several times. I really like it. It is a good size for those oversized pies. I had been wanting to get a covered pie pan for a long time. Now that I have one, I wonder why I waited so long. Highly recommended."
4,Almost perfect pie pan,"Even though I knew before purchasing this item that there were air holes in the lid and at times that's an advantage (like if you're taking a pie somewhere & it's still warm), I do wish it were air tight. For me that's the only downside. It's perfect for short term storage and I love the high dome for meringue pies. Overall, I'm very satisfied."
2,hard to get the lid off,"I make lots of pies & quiches and this seemed like a great way to keep them from getting crushed in the fridge or in transit to a friend's house. The lid is such a pain to get off, though, that I'm always worried I'm going to accidentally toss the whole pie on the floor when opening it. I finally just tossed the thing and am in the market for something better."
4,The story kept me reading till the end.,I enjoyed the story very much. I especially liked the way it went back and forth in history. The only part I didn't enjoy was the way the story ended. I think it needed something else.
5,Mary Higgins Clark,"When I first read this book, a number of years ago, I didn't really like it. I bought it this time because I tend to collect authors, and Anastasia Syndrome is part of a collection. I re-read the book, and was hooked."
3,The Anastasia Syndrome,"So not Mary Higgins Clark! Where's my happy ending? When I completed the story I felt I had wasted my time. I grant you it was exciting to read, and you came to realizse it was not going to be an uplifting story, but I enjoy MHC because it's fun to read and has a great ending. The hirstory behind the story was interesting."
3,Didn't really hold my interest.,"This was one of the earlier MHC books and it is obvious. The Anastasia Syndrome is obviously a collection of ""short"" MHC stories. The final one with the woman actually believing she was some sort of royalty was absurd. But, it's light entertainment, and to give the woman credit, it was an early novel."
4,Surprising Selection,"Anatasia Syndrome, by Mary Higgins Clark. Assemblage of ambitious and varied tales. Not formula at all, some of these stories will jolt the reader with their conclusion. Tightly written and clever, a nice change of pace."
4,Irish poetry anthology,"This antholgy includes much that is well-loved but not always considered scholarly, arranged in unusual but appropriate categories, such as ""The Land,"" ""The Clergy,"" ""Emigration,"" ""Invective,"" ""Easter Week, 1916."" Charming, with astute commentary."
5,Galapagos 's pic quality is absolutely fantastic!!,"I own a DVD copy of Planet Earth(P/E). I didnt get impressed by its BD version, a very modest upgrade.However, the Galapagos one totally blew me a galaxy away...definitely one of the best pictured BDs I've ever seen!Demo-level sharpness and color!! I even want to plan a trip to those isles..The packaging of P/E content really sucks, I spent 5 mins trying to remove those fragile P/E Discs from the case, other 3 cases are fine.Overall, this is a very delicious feast about the nature&history; of our Earth. 5 stars!!"
2,Terrible packaging flaw,"First off, this is not a review of the content. These programs are outstanding, high-quality endeavors that help educate us about the natural world.I am writing about about the terrible flaw in the Planet Earth blu-ray package itself. Discs 1 and 4 are not easily removed. The middle push button isn't pushable at all! I snapped Disc 4 because I struggled to remove it from the container. After getting a replacement from Amazon, I tried to be even more careful the second time around. Again, I snapped Disc 4 of Planet Earth.It could be I'm just a fool, but shouldn't a disc be able to come out much more easily than what I experienced? I'm only curious if anyone else experienced this issue."
2,DVD Ganges,"Recently I bought the four part BBC High Definition Natural History collection DVD set. Of the four so far I have seen only Ganges. I bought Planet Earth long time ago.I am very much disappointed that BBC. that strives for perfection, could not find one individual who could correctly and properly pronounce the names of the places mentioned in the DVD, especially because most of the places mentioned are not only holy places for Hindus (I being one) but are also held in very high reverence by Hindus. I do not expect such oversight by BBC.The quality of surround sound is far inferior to that in Planet Earth."
5,Amazing!,Amazing collection. Well worth it for the complete package! My family and guests that visits and watch love this blu-ray collection. It's worth keeping and displaying on get together parties and playing to the guests.
4,Mahler Third,"Musical performance: solid and effective, if a bit cautious.Camera work and production values: a bit stodgy and unimaginative."
1,Beware of this product,"I received this item in a timely matter, however that is where the good part of my purchase ended. This item did not work right out of the box. When I went to change the batteries I discovered that the batteries were corroded and the entire battery housing was corroded. I wanted to contact the company, but the only option was via email. I returned the item, without even being able to TRY to exchange it, and I did get my credit right away. I am a big fan of Little Tikes products, but this series leaves something to be desired."
4,two hot aussie guys doin there thang,kaylan's second single is a smash and has the vibe to get you out of your seat shaking it.The dance remixes are for that night party where you want something more.The rock me all night remix is another funky hit to make you dance and also the pic on the front is a great perve!
4,Great review book,Good material for review if you know the French langauge already. Aside from that this book is a very good primer for the basics.
3,NOT AS SHOWN -,"I ordered this item (3 lbs of Soil Moist granules in a plastic bottle-like container) and paid $18 + 6.49 for shipping and handling. I chose this item over the other item (3 lbs of granules in a ziplock bag, for $22.95) because I assumed that the back of the container would contain detailed instructions on how and how much of the granules to use.What I got was the other item, 3 lbs of granules in a ziplock bag; no instructions whatsoever. I will not bother to return them for an exchange, as I suspect that the picture above is deliberately misleading.AMAZON PLEASE NOTE: You (or Discount Lawn Care) owe me $1.54. I do not plan to sue, but you also owe me a detailed instruction sheet, plus storage instructions (cold garage OK?). You have both my street address and my e-mail address."
5,"Does what it should, retains LOTS of moisture so I can water less often.","I'd tried another product (Hydro-Stretch)that didn't absorb much, if any, water, but this did the job. I put a spoonful in a glass and filled it with water. The crystals at the bottom of the glass sucked it all in, getting 20-30 times larger, at least. I poured out about half the glass and what was left STILL absorbed enough water to fill the glass to the top again. I poured out about half of that, and it still absorbed more water. The crystals start out roughly the size of a grain of sand, but swell up to little jiggly bits of what looks like clear Jello, about 1/3 to 1/2 the size of a dime. That's plenty good enough for me. As another reviewer noted, you don't need a lot, because this is thirsty stuff. Mixing it up with potting soil (or whatever) and then adding water will help keep the ground from getting compacted as the crystals expand. Neat stuff. I wonder if fire fighters could make some use of it."
5,A must for us tall dudes,super great mat for the price and no more hanging feet or head off one end. I am going from doing yoga with a 1/2 inch thick exercise mat that moved every time I did to this one. Seems like it will hold up for the long haul.
4,Nicely padded and great for the tall folks!,"This yoga mat is well worth the money and has held up well so far. It's padded quite a bit more than what you can buy at Target or Walmart, any extra padding helps. It's also long, so if you're a tall one, you'll have plenty of room on this mat. I would only suggest to the maker that they make a simple string handle so that a carry option is not an extra cost, it should come with the mat."
3,extra long yoga mat,"it is not finished well: the ends of mine are cut at crooked angles.i am happy with the extra long length, which motivated my purchase... but this product doesn't qualify as ""deluxe"".it is a raw chunk of textured black foam."
5,No bells. No whistles. Just a great yoga mat.,"Yoga did wonders for calming my mind and balancing my body, but standard-length mats didn't accommodate my 6-foot-plus frame. My hands or feet were always off the mat and slipping and sliding on the floor. A local store had an ""extra-long"" 72"" mat, but that wasn't enough.I found and ordered this mat when I decided to resume yoga classes - after a one-year hiatus - and participate regularly. The highest compliment I can offer is that I don't notice the mat. It's long enough to stay on, soft enough for comfort without being excessively cushy, and offers my hands and feet a very good grip - exactly what I need.The price was very reasonable, and after a couple class sessions I have to say it was worth every penny because it allows me to focus on yoga rather than the mat."
4,High quality yoga mat,"I've had my yoga mat for several weeks now, using it daily and its held up fine so far. The only scuff I put on it was from tugging on it with my toenail on accident going into a fast lunge. (So keep those things clipped!) Overall, it's a very cushy/comfortable mat that accommodates taller yogis. However, it is about the same width as a regular yoga mat."
3,The quality of the mat is disappointing - surface is too slick.,"The mat is not as sticky as a yoga mat should be. I slide out of poses. At this point I hope this will improve with use.I wanted a longer mat and that's what I got, just wish I had not ordered 2."
5,Irresistable,"I remember seeing this on Indian programming TV. I had few clues to what was really happening, but the irresistable ""Choli Ke Peeche"" song & dance production made us seek out this movie again and again. I'm buying it with English subtitles. The songs may not be translated (according to another review), but both Hindi lyrics and the translation exist on the web. Search for them. It's worth it to be able to sing along. This is a true blockbuster Bollywood movie: spectacular!"
3,the research for the contents of the book is amazing.,"I would say that some info. is not fully understood by many of the readers which are not familiar with the lifestyle of the hasidim. A lot emphesis was made on the code "" mit mazel und brucha"", which I think was not formed as a code, nor is it one for those who currently speak Yiddish; Knowing the language I could say that by all business`s conducted by the hasidim, even on finding a mate you can hear this as well."
4,good color,"its part of a two bulb system on my lamp. its a good color, way better than those regular bulb shaped halogens that take forever to fully light up. Kinda pricey tho"
5,AN AWESOME LIGHTSABER!!!!!!!,"I currently bought this lightsaber a couple of weeks ago and it is so awesome. the batteries don't give it much extra weight and me and my friend who has a Qui-Gon-Jinn Lightsaber were dueling lots. we would turn off the lights and turn on our lightsabers and duel in the dark. I have an entire Jedi Council and order containing 32 of my friends.have Nerf guns and shoot them in various places and build up our defenses! I am the Head Supreme. Anyway the sound effects are really neat and the light is bright, so overall.. this lightsaber rocks buy it today!!! ""I...I killed them all"" Anikin Skywalker- Ep II Attack of The Clones. This was the beginning of his fall."
4,Abandon Toy!,...it's not very durable! All I did was give it a good swing and now it makes a funny sound when I hold it. It can't retrieve all the way into the handle and the handle is too long! It's not even half of it's blade. Don't buy this toy. Go save up for something else like a video game or a Master Replica edition.
3,Not about Disney Weddings,"This is a great video if you are wanting to learn general wedding information, like types of dresses, information about invitations and destination weddings. This video will NOT, however, help you if you are wanting to learn more about your disney fairy tale wedding. I thought it would have information about the weddings speciffically held at disneyland or disneyworld, which it does not."
3,$8.25 for a less attractive design than Villeroy & Boch's petite fleur tray,This tray is identical in design to the Villeroy and Boch petite fleur tray but this tray is $6 cheaper. The tray is cream colored with blurry rose shaped pink blobs and green leaves. It's not the most attractive plastic tray.
1,Utter tripe.,"It's interesting, the movie was utter crap, and yet this book manages to be worse. Never have I had the viscreal repulsion to words printed on paper that this book produced, nor engaged in such constant mental rewriting for mere syntax, to say nothing of suspense, descriptiveness, or elucidation of charater. I'm never amazed by the drooling idiocy to which such marketing driven sh*** can sink, but in this case, I managed, as I rarely do, to be appalled. I regret to announce that the form wouldn't let me give it negative stars. Thank god I didn't pay for it. Please save your money as well."
1,"Great story, poor writing.","Brooks' novelization of George Lucas's screenplay for ""The Phantom Menace"" is greatly disappointing: I found the writing to be uninspired, painfully banal, and unsophisticated. The book clearly is intended for readers at the junior-high-school level. While I didn't expect literature, I had hoped that the novelization would appeal to adult readers who happen also to be fans of Star Wars. I'm sorry to say that this book does not."
1,This poor novelization is the REAL 'Phantom Menence'!,"It felt as if Terry Brooks had to get this one out the door in a hurry. Read it only if you're truly a 'hard-core' Star Wars fanatic, otherwise just go see the movie again. Even four different book covers couldn't save this one!"
1,A cruel joke compared to the original three books,"This book is far weaker than the original three books, mainly because the story and dialogue is more shallow, mundane and cliche. I couldn't decide whether this book was meant as a parody of the original three, a comedy, a Disney story, or a Power Rangers episode. None of the subtlety, depth, sustained focus on universal human themes, and slow revelation that made the original three books so special is present in this story. The only thing good I can say about the book is that it Brooks had no choice but to strip away the orgy of cartoonish special effects that created such an incoherent, ugly galaxy in the movie."
3,The movie was better... really...,"The Jedi were not portrayed as being as intuned with the Force as much as they should be.Furthermore, almost all the scenes seen in the book and not in the movie were really better left on the cutting room floor. Some were simply un-necessary. (especially one scene involving a certain droid on Coruscant... WHY!?)The love between Padm√© and Anakin is much deeper, but such romance really should be saved for Episode II.I personally think the movie version of this story was better overall, but I strongly recommend this book for any Star Wars fan."
4,"Not the best book I have ever read, but very good.","I found that I definetly have read better books in my life, however, I enjoyed reading Star Wars Episode 1, because it was a fun book to read. Also, it enlightened me to what I was going to see in the movie. I read the book because I was worried that I wouldn't get to the movie in the next month. But anyway, the book was awesome!!"
3,"Sketchy plot, but with great potential.","The Phantom Menace read like an outline for a potentially great story. Little character development forces us to make many assumptions to fill the void left by the writer. The plot has a few nice twists which will keep Star Wars fans satisfied until the final release of the movie. Terry Brooks is a fantasy writer, while Star Wars needed a science-fiction writer. Paul Anderson would probably have served as a better vehicle for the development of the story. Never the less, a story worth reading of a movie worth watching."
5,Better than the movie,this is one of the better books I have ever read is awesome u have to buy it it is great it give u a better point of view i give 6 stars not 5
2,Not as moving as the original Trilogy,"I bought the book as soon as it was available in anticipation of the release of the movie and, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the story. However, the original trilogy was a moving tale and a modern fable, and this book begining the prequil does not come close to the quality of the trilogy. It seems to have been rushed and written at a 5th to 6th grade reading level. I wish that Timothy Zahn had been contracted to write the prequil as his writing style is complex and of the highest quality. Overall I enjoyed the book but would have liked more depth to the characters and the story."
2,"Decent book, after seeing the movie","Brooks failed to capture the essence of the Star Wars universe well in this book. It was decent at best when I read it before the movie, after seeing the movie, the book is good for filling in plot details such as the first Pod Race we only hear about in the movie, and explaining some other things about lines, such as ""always two there are, a master and an apprentice."
2,Story seemed to be rushed.,"Typically a fan of Terry Brooks, and just about every Star Wars book that I've read, I was disappointed with Brooks' version of Phantom Menace. The first half of the book was very detailed, and a great read. Unfortunately, from the point where he covered Anakin's pod race on, he just skimmed over the plot of the movie. In fact, the last half of the movie (at least) is covered in 100 pages of the book. If you're a die hard fan like me, you'll buy it just to have it, but if you're looking for an absorbing read, look elsewhere. On a final note, Lucas should have had Salvatore write the adaptation, at least he could have done the battle scenes justice."
3,"Good book, but needs to offer more detail.","It was a good book, don't get me wrong. The two scenes involving the pod racers were written perfectly. However, I found that most of the scenes didn't take time to go through details of setting and some character desciptions. Most of it was very dry and to the point, which can be a good thing in a movie, but rarely works in novels."
3,Very Basic...good for newbies,Buy this one first...just as it says...first lessons. Buy it before you get an accordian...and see if you really want to try to play one. Worth the read and the money.
1,Not what you expect,"I thought I was ordering a 14"" wreath and what I got was a small bunch of lavender. The picture shown is not what you get. Be careful when you order anything as what is in the picture is not what you end up receiving. I won't make the mistake of ordering anything from this vendor again."
5,Couldn't put it down,"Callan O'Malley is an ex Army Sergeant and is now a biker. Terri Barclay is a waitress hiding secrets that could get her killed and belongs to one of the bikers. Callan wins Terri in card game.Their story is a rollercoaster ride of events, including drugs, gunrunning, murder and dirty cops. The ending will take you completely by surprise.This is an absolutely fantastic read that I can't recommend highly enough. It is gripping from the very first page and you won't want to stop reading until the last page. So don't start it until you have plenty of time to finish it. I only hope we have another book from Roselle soon. This is one I will want to read time and again."
4,"Fun, and listenable","This is a great CD. Not only are there several tracks I like for dancing, but it's a fun listen in the car."
2,"Odd story, bad Kindle edition","I have read most of Maugham, for many years. I don't know when in his pantheon he wrote this book but it seems like it was an experiment. Not one of his strongest by any means. But the Kindle edition is rife with errors. I have also noticed that Kindle books such as this used to be free. This is the poorest rendering of a Kindle book I have purchased. Way too many mistakes to be acceptable at any price except free."
5,The whole CD is great!,"I look at all the song titles from this release and they're all solid tunes. There's not one that I would want to skip to get to the next song. NR is probably one of the most underrated rock bands from the 80's. They're still around and occasionally putting out new music, but the bulk of what they've done and done well is found in their first five albums. Midnight Madness was, of course, their big breakout record, with Rock In America and the smash Sister Christian. Many people didn't bother to scratch beneath the surface of this ""power ballad"" group to discover that they wrote great songs, with great dual lead vocals, and hot guitar playing. This album, in my opinion, is one of their best, although I think all of them, through Neverland, are great rock albums."
3,Night Ranger give us the expacted,"Night Ranger are a long time favourite band of mine, but I seem to be one of the few who isn't crazy about the song ""Sister Christian"".Night Ranger's strength is their ability to write melodic songs, and the best track on this release is without doubt ""Rumours in the air"" - a rather un-rocking song but still so melodic (one of the band's best songs ever). Other memorable songs that would fit on a compilation of ""greatest hits"" are the faster ""Why does love have to change"", ""Passion play"" and ""Chipping away"". That's it... but four out of nine isn't bad. I guess that's the case with most of Night Ranger's albums - one great half and another not so great half. When it comes to Night Ranger, their personal low point is rather high, and we don't get any really bad or lousy songs."
4,This album rocks twenty five years later,"Oh the eighties,and how we were lucky to have been a teenager.This album thanks to MTV pushed these talented muscians to the top.Classic fast paced album which seems to end quickly but never a dull track.You Can Still Rock In America,the lead track right through is non stop.These albums are hard to find in stores.Thank god for amazon!Jack Blades,Kelly Keagy and Brad Gillis gave it all.I was fortunate to have seen them perform live and WOW! Damn Yankees stuff is hard to find too. Crank this baby up and You Can Rock In America TOO"
5,"Incredible album, lame CD packaging.","Love this album. Takes me back to another time every time I put it on. Every song is infectious, with the highlights You Can Still Rock in America, Why Does Love Have to Change, Touch of Madness, When You Close Your Eyes. I've always thought the assemblage of talent in Night Ranger (Keagy, Blades, Gillis, Watson, ""Fitz"" Gerald) was second to none. Only recently replaced my worn out cassette with a CD. However, I was extremely disappointed in MCA's packaging of this Disc. No liner notes, other than the song titles and the producer's name. Would be cool to see a nice re-master package for this disc, as well as Night Ranger's other titles."
2,How is this not a romance novel?,"The characters, the plot and the dialogue of this novel were what I'd expect to find in typical romance novel. The characters were trite: the self-absorbed fiance, the longsuffering, misunderstood woman who just needs a warm, sensitive man, the warm, sensitive man, and the loveable child-abuse victim. The writing was good, the plot a bit predictable,and it would have been fine if I had been looking in the Harlequin section."
4,A Pleasant Read,"I enjoyed the book quite a bit. It does start off a bit slow. I felt the book kept hitting me over the head with David Koresch and Waco references. I never quite figured out what the analogy was.But once the story gets going, it's interesting and charming in it's own way.It's one of those books that I looked forward to picking back up and seeing what was going to happen next. It's a quirky story of three misanthropes who somehow find each other.The book was a very pleasant read."
4,A great help,"Commentary is very helpful, easy to read and understandable while pursuing the study of the book of Genesis in an organized Bible Study. Well written."
3,The Warriors,"This book wasn't the best book I've ever read,and it wasn't the worst either. This book was mostly about a kid named Jake who tells you about his lacrosse games."
3,The Warriors,I read a ok book with the title being THE WARRIORS by Joseph Bruchac. It is a historical fiction the book is in the present time. The main charters in the story are Jake and his lacrosse team friends. The main problem occurs in the book when he gets mad at the sport of lacrosse and himself because he keeps getting hurt and he can't make the team. My favorite part is when Jake finely gets better at lacrosse and he is getting to play more! It was my favorite part because he finely reached his goal. I really didn't like this book as much I thought I would because I would like more action. I would recommend this book to someone who doesn't like books with action.
3,The Warriors,"I read an ok book titled The Warriors by Joseph Bruchac. It is a historical fiction book set in America, in the present time period.The main characters in this story were Jake and his fellow team members. The book is about boy named Jake and he gets mad at the Iroquois people because they call the sport lacrosse and that means something different in America. Finally, he realizes the sport is fun.The main problem of the book occurs when he gets mad at the sport because he keeps getting hurt and the name of lacrosse means something different in America.My favorite part of the book was when Jake finally plays in a game. This is my favorite part because Jake showed courage, teamwork and he reached his goal, I really didn't like this book because I'm more of a football guy and also there not to much action in this book. I wouldn't recommend this book to my friend Andy because he likes pretty much the same books as me.My rate for this book is ***"
1,Worst Lightsaber ever,My friend got one of these and it sucked. It is completely unholdable when playing in a lightsaber fight. That curved handle is so horrible. IT might as well be a gun of some sort. When ever you hold it the blade is pointing right to the side. I recomend not buying this. If you want a red lightsaber get darth vaders.
5,Clever Take on Werewolf Films,"I had never heard of the ""Ginger Snaps"" trilogy before, but was pleasantly surprised at the clever nature of the films. If anyone is a fan of werewolf movies these are a must! The dialogue is priceless as the sisters continually spar with each other, friends, antagonist, and parents in all three. The story line is really good given the timeline of all three. Watch it with an open mind and a childs thrill and fear of the unknown and these movies rock! Lets face it, what are werewolf movies all about? These are much better than the original Lon Chaney movies. Plus, the young ladies are really sirens in disguise."
5,totally good,this is the best movie...it really rocks....it is a good horror movie that will keep you on the edge...its one of the best movies i have ever seen...its a story about two sisters that are really close and at the same time it is a horror movie...it is really good watch it
1,laughably bad,"This DVD looks very amateur with tacky graphics and transitions. Worse, it features almost no footage of the band; the vast majority of the 1-hour ""documentary"" is interviews with people associated with the band, with occasional clips of band members from old 1980s interviews.The additional content of the DVD features an unreadable, usable discography, and a trivia game.You're much better off watching VH1's Behind the Music special on U2 than wasting your time with this DVD."
1,An Absolute Waste of Time,"Not only as the other reviewer mentioned are there virtually zero interviews with the band, because it's an unauthorized biography there's no U2 music.Don't even waste your money. Even if you're a hardcore U2 fan (I am), this is useless."
5,everything is in bloOm!,This is the best album that Audio Adrenaline have produced. it is also the last cd that Barry Blair plays leadguitar on. I still wonder why Barry quit the band. This is the best selling record and you can hear why. This one is a pure Rock album.This is also the best cd I've ever heard.
3,"Solid, bare-knuckles rock","When they hit the studio to record this album, Audio A set out to make an album that they could easily reproduce in a concert setting. The result is a good, solid bare-knuckles rock album. Unlike most christian music, it isn't overproduced, isn't afraid to be really loud, and is a lot of fun. They've stopped trying to be DCTalk -- no rap here -- and it's a good thing. This is a rock n' roll band. And not a bad one at that. I think this disc is better than Don't Censor Me, and probably better than Some Kid of Zombie. Though that's a close race. The key to enjoying Audio Adrenaline is to turn it up loud and not think about it. So the lyrics aren't all that great. Play it loud enough and you'll hardly notice. Barry Blair's guitar is gutsy and quick, most of the album is catchy and...a lot of fun."
2,Disappointing Disc,"I am a huge rock music fan. I picked up this disc when it first came out in '96. I was drawn in because the band re-made the classic ""Free Ride"" by Edgar Winter. I thought that 70's influenced Christian music might be worth a try. Unfortunately, they did a terrible job of it; not only that, but the rest of the CD isn't much better. The production is absolutely painful to listen to and some of the lyrics are embarrassingly shallow. I know that the large majority of reviews for this CD are positive, but I really think that this is an awful CD. I don't want to come across as being against Christian music, I am just against bad music in general. If you are a fan of rock music, and you are looking for something from the mid-90's by Christian artists, you might want to try Third Day's self-titled debut, DC Talk's ""Jesus Freak"" or Rebecca St. James' ""God."""
5,Highly Recommended for Marketing Professionals,"There are lots of books out there that describe the way branding, advertising and customer experiences are intended to work online but this is the first one I've read that shows how in the real world the theoretical models can be manipulated or subverted. Murray explains how to calculate how much some of the brand abuse that happens can cost your company, and how to defend your brand and avoid these costs. It is loaded with real examples and stories so I found it very enjoyable to read. The glossary and samples in the appendix will also be handy. Anyone working in marketing today needs to read this book."
4,"Great Show, Better Music","While the show was funny and silly, the songs are what made it happen. Some great funny tunes to belt too, and love songs to make you want to believe in ""Happily Ever After"""
5,ONCE UPON A MATTRESS,I was there at the begiunning in 1959. Or course I loved having it and it is in good condition so this makes it all the more pleasant.
4,Once upon a mattress,"Arrived on time, great condition, used it that day working on a show with kids..thanks"
5,an oldie but a goodie,Loved Carol Burnett then and love her now. This original cast CD is a lovely trip down memory lane.
2,Too much for too little,I was disappointed to see how little was included in this kit considering the price. I expected instruction books and better quality tools for what I paid.
3,A Bit To Vague...,"""Under A Glass Moon"" has wonderful art, no doubt about it. The rich costumes and idea's make it all worth while. But, the story is a bit too vague for my liking. It keep's jumping back and forth to the presant and the past, making it almost unbearably confusing & hard to follow. There is a good plot to the story, but the book is making it too hard to follow. Most of the character's are annoying and whiney, and one character (I think some of you know what I meen) is highly unrealistic for a mother! If you are willing to put up with it though, go ahead and try it!!"
4,TokyoPop's Silver Lining,"I enjoyed this first volume very much. The story is atypical of the manga TokyoPop has been domestically releasing, probably due in part to the fact that the author is Korean and not Japanese. The art in this book is amazing and detailed; no lazy line drawings spruced up with pretty screentones here. Regrettably, TokyoPop has compared this book with Harry Potter on their website, but don't listen, they'll mislead you into their American pop-culture trap of doom! I can't wait for the second volume to come out in September 2003."
3,Shouldn't be taken seriously,"This manhwa is beautifully drawn but should not be taken seriously. It's full of chibis and funny faces etc. even though the general idea is quite interesting. It's just too bad that thanks to all the hilarity, the feelings between the characters just don't run deep enough for you to get really emotionally caught up in their story."
4,Very Pretty.,"This manga got me from the looks. I saw beautiful drawings and great looking characters. The story lacked a few things like character development and introductions. In the first volume, I think that you should get a feel for the characters and what they would be like in the oncoming volumes but in this one I felt that the characters were a little lacking. I still liked them and the over all story premise I thought was good. For what the character development lacked, the beautiful drawings on each and every page made up for it."
5,One of the best Kiri collections,The celebration of Kiri's 50th birthday was a visual and audio feast! A wonderful variety of familiar and unfamiliar operatic selections. Plus a nice mix of modern classics and Maori music. The encores were delightful.
4,Ahhhh!,"I bought this for a girlfriend a whiiiile ago. It was a sort of sentimental thing since on our first few dates, we saw quite a few kit foxes running around. It was pretty soft, but she didn't seem to enjoy it much. I don't think she really cared for it. Not to say that this wasn't a good plush, she just didn't appreciate thoughtful gifts. But, whatever. Good stuff."
5,Amazing classic sadly overlooked,"If you're lucky enough to know nothing about this story, then don't read any descriptions about it! Instead, get your hands on a copy ASAP and read it without any foreknowledge. I knew what the story was about before reading it, and I consider that a spoiler on par with knowing Jekel is turning into Hyde before reading and discovering this in the way the author intended. The story was still very enjoyable, I think I would have enjoyed it even more had the suspense and mystery not already been spoiled for me. Reading Carmilla I can now see where another, far more famous, classic author drew inspiration. The subtly, creeping horror of this book is deliciously spooky. Highly recommended."
5,Creepy!,"Camilla is part of one of LeFanu's larger works--In a Glass Darkly. However, it stands alone very nicely. This short volume deserves a place alongside Dracula and Frankenstein as a classic of the Gothic genre. It is more subtle than most horror novels, in that Van Helsing and armed peasants are nowhere to be found, but the author creates the right mood for a chilling tale and delivers."
3,"I love the story, but the kindle edition is somewhat wanting","I've always loved this short story. It's well worth reading if you like horror fiction or vampire stories. It's underrated and probably will appeal more to modern readers of vampire tales than Dracula. Carmilla is a mysterious, somewhat sympathetic character who is still a worthy opponent. But I don't know why this story isn't available in a free edition, since it's in the public domain. The actual download is not really worth the payment for a public domain work."
4,Schuetzen review,"Ths book is actually written by Charlie Dell with input from Wayne Schwartz. Anyone wanting to see the technical side of schuetzen rifle construction, proper use,care ,and feeding of the schuetzen should have this must read item. It's written by one of today's most knowledgeable shooters. Wonderful accumulation of detailed information it is one of those books that will become the backbone for shooters in years to come. (...)"
2,Lo-Fi,"This is a disappointing recording. There is a lot of re-verb, and in some of the recordings the level of the voices are below the instruments.Also all the liner notes are in Japanese.All in all a poor quality recording."
4,See the Yak Yak,I used this book to introduce high-level pre-schoolers to homonymns. The illustrations made the lesson fun and was an excellent teaching tool from cover to cover.
2,Waste of money,"The book is unpractical for the working engineer and the mathematics is simplified calculus which is not understandable to the average practicing engineer, but seems to be in favor of academic types. This is not a book for someone who wants to learn why production equipment works. The chapter on multiphase flow is its only saving grace, but any cheap paper on the subject will say as much. I would recomened the OGCI books on Production Technology. Way cheaper...way better..."
1,It is too slow,"After a month, I have not received the book yet, I need to borrow my friend's book for school. If I know it is this slow, I will buy a used book from the bookstore."
5,Perpetuem works for ultra-marathons,"I use Perpetuem in my 100 mile trail ultra-marathons. I can usually stand it for the first 75 miles or so and then the taste gets to me and I have to stop using it and switch to normal aid-station food. But it has enabled me to finish two 100 milers as well as a 120 mile trail ultra. It doesn't mix as well as say an Accelerade, or taste as good, but it gets the job done."
5,very good!,"this is my first tristan und isolde DVD collection. I've been waiting for a long time. finally when i got the mail, i found a beartiful special stamp which is come from Israel. I save the stamp as a souvenir, there is a Hanukkah light on it! beautiful!"
2,endurance,"Tristan looks like an Elvis impersonator and acts like the tin woodman. Isolde strongly resembles Hillary Clinton, only older. She acts like someone in a silent movie. The set designer wins the booby prize, being the worst of all this clunky performance. In any case, give thanks for the wonderful orchestra led by Daniel Barenboim. It almost makes the DVD version bearable."
2,Magazine Rack not as nice as picture,The three sections do not stay neatly as shown on the picture. The cloth has to be evenly spread out between the three sections which is impossible without some modification. Magazines slouch and curl on each section of the rack.
4,"Functional, durable, easy to assemble","My wife purchased this exact same item from a catalog a couple of years ago and I am pleased to say that, a couple of years later, we are still keeping it by the coffee table.The assembly was easy - 10-15 minutes - and, as far as I can remember, 2 years later, no special tools were needed.The rack can hold a sufficient amount of magazines and I liked the fact that the 3 pockets allowed us to segregate the kids magazines - National Geographic, Discover - from some of the newsies and some illustrated books on interior decorating. Surprisingly, the rack manages to stay stable and well balanced, even when filled with material."
5,Chevy truck kit,"There have been a lot of changes in the building of mounting kits! This kit is one that really needed to be changed,and change they did!! They have made the color perfect, and the built on extension bezel is a must for today's head units.The top mounted locks hold tight. I would not purchase any other brand!"
3,Not quite as 'handy' as one might initially think.,"Decent book to springboard off into other, more in depth, avenues of inquiry. But, by necessity of brevity, a somewhat maddeningly shallow book that uses technical jargon and can sometimes be confusing and not at all handy."
5,Jam Packed With Cool Facts!,This book is jam packed full of very interesting facts that make this book perfect for all ages!
2,Relentlessly downbeat,"MB: One of the most relentlessly downbeat novels I have ever read. The story of a loser who loses. Everything goes wrong. He can't stand up to anyone: his students; his wife; his manipulating, dishonest, self-seeking `friend'; the poet Nur and his entourage; or the tape recorder seller and his cousins. When offered a way of doing something significant at the end of the novel he hasn't the courage to take it. He fails to commit suicide and returns to a life of failure and (increased) hopelessness. I failed to spot even one admirable character in the whole novel. Is it a good novel? It raises all sorts of important questions. Perhaps it might stimulate a desire to do something about the corrupt world - but what's the use?"
4,"Delightful, light-handed academic satire.","I haven't seen the film, and I'm not a student of Urdu poetry, but I really enjoyed this book. In fact, it's the only truly delightful, light-handed academic satire I've ever read. You'll find none of the hit-'em-over-the-head-in-case-they-miss-the-point nonsense of Jane Smiley's Moo and none of the archness and linguistic density of Alexander Theroux's D'Arconville's Cat. Desai employs a gentle, kind humor and simple, but totally controlled, style to create two memorable characters who will long outlive more fervid attempts to show the sometimes ridiculous lengths to which academics must go to achieve their goals and the goals thrust upon them."
2,Baffling and pointless,"IN CUSTODY was the December selection of my book club, and when we met none of us knew why we had spent the time on this novel. The novel tells the pointless story of Deven, an Indian college instructor, who has the opportunity to interview the great Urdu poet Nur. His efforts to interview Nur are ultimately -- after many misadventures that may be supposed to be funny --fruitless. Nur himself turns out to be a broken, querulous old man, and Deven is the same whining weakling at the end of the book that he was in the beginning. The characters are completely unsympathetic; the prose is dry and occasionally deliberately obscure. All our book club could find to discuss was how in the world this book got shortlisted for the Booker Prize, and how in the world anyone could make a movie of it."
2,Desai's In Custody is tedious,"Although Desai's In Custody is well written and intelligent, it is tedious and dull. The many important images (ie: the role of women, and the dead language- Urdu) presented in the novel are hard to find. The book is time consuming and boring."
4,Our Four Year Old is Thrilled!,"When our son put in a request for a light saber, we were not sure which to purchase, so instead of deciding, we sent Grandma to decide. This light saber is pretty neat, making sound effects, which are enhanced by the movement of the saber. The volume is low, which is good for parents. The light is a little weak, and it is hard to tell it is lit if the room is too bright, but that does not bother our son much, the green plastic looks good enough without the light anyway. The saber does not retract all the way, and can be a bit difficult to expand. Overall, our son is quite satisfied, and the sounds make it more fun to him."
5,Helpful,"I received this book from my father's Pastor immediately after my father's death. Though I realize that everyone is different, this book helped me immensely in dealing with my father's passing and I believe it can help a great multitude of people--possibly even those who aren't Catholic to an extent. My faith has been tested and still is, but I have found some peace in some of the points made in the book and it is helping my faith to win the struggle. Though it's been over a year now since his death, I still find the book worthwhile to read; especially so after the numbness and the speed of things that occur immediately after death. If you've lost someone recently, I am truly sorry. If you're Catholic, definitely consider purchasing this book. If you're not, think of doing the same, if only to glean one point to help you with your struggle."
2,Sad tweeter,"These tweeters are cool looking, but they sound ""squawky"" seem to have some kind of lower treble peak that makes them sound out of balance and rather annoying. They are not smooth sounding and don't play well with other speakers. Since they are piezo tweeters they don't have a crossover to get in the way or to install, but the sound quality is likely going to make that not worth the benefit. They may work with a system that is just a woofer crossed over to them, but as an add on to a system to help with the treble, I'd avoid these."
4,Illy,"I just spent a month in Italy and got hooked on Illy brewed in a standard drip filter coffee maker. I used 6-7 coffee spoons for a 10-cup pot. Once I got the right ratio, I found the coffee full-bodied and sweet without acidity. I am glad I brought a couple of cans back from Italian grocery stores; it costs double here. Keep in mind that it is canned coffee, so don't expect it to be as robust as fresh roasted from your local coffee shop. But, if you like to experiment with different coffees, give it a try. It is packaged in a nicely designed can with a screw-on top that seals pretty well."
3,Illy Espresso,"Trying Illy espresso for the first time I was really looking forward to it, primarily because of all the publicity the company gets. After following the directions in my new espresso maker I pulled the shots and came away disappointed. This is very average espresso.I've been drinking espresso for 20 years and making it at home for the last 6. The crema was below average (very thin) as was the flavor (especially when I paid $11.95 plus shipping for an 8.8 ounce container). I have since pulled other shots with the same result: flavor was not robust and very, very average."
2,not great,"I'm still not sure why some of these work and some don't, this is one of the ones that gets ejected from my car stereo all the time"
3,Does the job with a little difficulty and no frills,"First off, like all the other reviews say, this is a black product with a straight, non-coiled cord. So if that was your primary motivation for buying this product, look elsewhere.The adapter works pretty well -- it's easy as pie to use (especially as compared to iTrips), and the sound quality is pretty good. My only complaint is that there is a clicking and grinding noise when the adapter is in use. This really isn't that much of a problem if you are like me and play your music fairly loudly, but if you're the softer music type, the noise would get really annoying.Overall, for the price, it works."
4,Good for the money,"When I got this, it was not a spiral cord like shown, it was just straight, but that does not bother me. It was working pretty well for about 2-3 weeks, but last week it started to skip. Now I don't know if that is because I didn't use it daily, or because the Texas heat got to it, but it skips pretty frequently. Now I try to use it everyday to see if it makes a difference. But for the price I paid for it, I am not really complaining. It's great for it's price, and it is hard to find tape decks because very few cars, unless older have them. But a good product for the money."
2,Not as pictured,I selected this item because it is pictured in white with a coiled cord. It arrived in flat black with a cheap straight cord. It does not even work in one of my tape decks. It does however work when I switched the adapters in another deck. So it does work but don't believe what you see.
3,Different Than Pictured,"i bought this item and it's nice but different than expected. it's not blue on white it's black on black. the cord is not coiled it's a straight black cord but it seems very cheap. It's working now so i can't complain to much. I guess you get what you pay for. pay nothing, get nothing. overall rating... it's ok."
4,"Not like pictured, does the job","I got this cassette adapter for my truck. As other reviewers said, it isn't the one pictured with the coil, and it's black. Mine must have been sitting in storage for a while because the 3.5mm connector to your audio device (mp3 player, phone, whatever) was oxidized and had a bad connection (intermittent sound, either left/right working but not both, etc.) I believe that once I give the connector a decent cleaning that it'll work fine.Beats an FM transmitter any day of the week though."
5,Excellent! Can't beat the price for what you get!,This product has been on point since day one. No complaints. Great deal! Jump on this one!
5,Great alternative to changing out a deck,"This works better than I expected. Great volume control, works with the subs, and easy to ""install"" (my other option was just change out my deck) The cord is plenty long enough which is what I was fearful of. Now it does make a winding noise when the tape is in and is plugged into nothing, but that is to be expected."
4,"not what i expected, but good","The image shows a white one with a coiled cord, n got a black one with a straight cord. But it works just fine."
1,It doesn't work.,"My daughter was so happy when we received it. We had lost the Belkin one we had for long time and fm transmitter thing didn't work at all. However, when we inserted it for first time, the tape mode went back into the radio mode. I kept inserting it and it finally played the ipod!But the sound would go on and off, on and off, on and off. So annoying. I only bought it for $6 something, so I am going to throw it away."
4,Extra iPod player,"For those of us who still have cassette players, this adapter is great. You place the cassette in the cassette player,plug it into your iPod, raise the iPod volume level to high, press PLAY on the cassette player then PLAY on your iPod. The music then can be heard from the cassette player's speakers! Cool, huh. This also works the same in your car's cassette player. The only problem I had was in fitting the cassette in the cassette player. I had to work with getting the slim cord to fit so that I could shut the cassette door, but when I finally did it, I was pleased with the results. This under-$10 Adapter is well worth it!"
1,DO NOT BUY,"I bought this to replace my half broken old 1 from a different brand, turned out the half broken 1 works much better. i can barely hear any music from this, i had to to turn my ipod on max, and the car stereo on near max to hear SOME music. I was gonna return it but the hassle and the shipping fee just doesnt worth it"
1,Do not buy this one!,"I thought I could use this for my MP3 player that I used for my audio books while I'm driving. Well, it did not work. I have to turn the volume all the way up both on my MP3 player and on my car and even after that the voice came out of the car is so low you can not hear it if you are driving on highway. Mind you, I'm not driving a dinky cheap car. It's a QX4 SUV with added base so the sound system is very good.Totally waste of money. I was thinking of return it but it was so cheap and it just not worth my time to the post office, plus the postage I have to pay to ship it back.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
1,terrible,DIDN'T WORK! THING WOULD PLAY 1 SONG THAN REWIND. WORST PURCHASE OF ALL TIME. DO NOT BUY!!!
2,Cheap but definitely not worth the price,"After having a Philips Cassette Adapter that lasted me for around a year, it finally broke and I decided to look for a cheap replacement, thinking that all adapters would be the same. After purchasing this product, I definitely know that's not true. As soon as I tested it with my usual music, static was extremely evident, which is odd considering that on the box, the description says NO STATIC. Very misleading, but for around 8 dollars, I can't be too mad. But still, this product was very disappointing and I can't recommend it to anyone."
2,does not work in my car.,Does not work in my car. I've compared it to my old tape deck adapter and don't see any differences.
4,Good sound and no interference,I bought this to use with a set of DVD players that mount on the back of the headrests. So far it has excellent sound (not tinny or too muddy) reproduction and the best thing is that it doesn't transmit high-pitched interference from the engine like some I have owned in the past.
1,"Plug is angled, not straight","The website and the package both show a straight electrical plug.However, the plug is actually angled, and does NOT FIT through my iPhone4's case -- the ""bumper"" style case is sufficiently thick, that the plug does not insert all the way.I'd trim the case, except the case's plastic is so hard (polycarbonate?) I don't think even a sharp razor would cut it.Cannot comment on the adapter's sound quality."
1,False Advertisement....,"I searched hard for a adapter that has the coil because I went threw 3 that didn't and the cords kept getting bent and stopped working. I'm very disappointed because what they show isn't what they give you, seems pointless to send it back because it was only 4.50....guess I'll use this one until it breaks and then go back on the hunt..."
1,Don't Buy This!,I bought this and it doesn't work. I contacted and sent the seller an email but won't respond. It's a rip off. It keeps on switching sides or ejects
3,More of a history of ideas than a biology text,"This book is about the history of the concepts around which the ""ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny"" developed, flourished and eventually faded out. Gould goes into the viewpoint of every significant biological thinker that ever thought anything about this phrase, and what that thinker thought about all the other thinkers.If you are really interested in the history of evolutionary thought, there is a point to reading this. But if you are just interested in reading about neat biological examples/life histories/concepts, this book is serious overkill.It is probably not fair to rate this book for what it is not, instead of what it is. However, once I decided to read this book (and I read it twice, with several years between), I found that I didn't enjoy the reading that much. As Mark Twain remarked about some piece of music, the book is not as long as it seems. But it sure does seem long!"
3,Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.,"When I was at Washington U. dental school in 1941,my professor of anatomy talked about ontogeny recapitulatesphylogeny. It has interested me my whole life, and I believeit today. In January I'll go to the Galapagos to see formyself and see Darwin's finch."
1,Great for a week or two...,"Mine has a Haier label rather than Amcor, but it's clearly the same machine. Worked great for 2 weeks or so, pulled a few full buckets of water out of my basement air. All of a sudden it stopped pulling water and became a glorified and noisy fan for days on end and the humidity grew to over 70%. I'm returning it today and shopping for a new brand...I recommend avoiding these Amcor/Haier machines. Reliability appears to be a major problem with them, and mine was very noisy - could hear it from upstairs and the unit is in the basement."
4,A fun toy based on Power Rangers TV Show,"I bought this toy for my son who's a huge fan of the Power Rangers. Not only is it a large action figure that he can play with, you can also turn it into a ""megazord"" that is also featured on the TV show. Not an educational toy, but a lot of fun for my son."
5,Pablo Picasso was never called a ******,"Not for every baby boomer; I have to say that years ago I really got hooked on the film and the soundtrack--some of my contemporaries can't stand this album--even for one of my friends, who did work as a Repo Man in Florida--he's still a Lynyrd Skynyrd devotee! But it's odd to look back at this film and listen to the soundtrack that took off in the mid-eighties (going on 30 + years ago). For me Black Flag's ""TV Party"" is still relevant. ""Pablo Picasso"" by the Burning Sensations is a classic (thanks to Jonathan Richman). Then there's ""Institutionalized"" by Suicidal Tendencies and the ""Let's have a War"" chant by Fear--classics for that generation. I was living in Seattle at the time, and this album seemed to resonate for that city and the existing zeitgeist. Not an album for conservatives!"
5,F-ing Fantastic,I love this CD and anyone who is a fan of the cult classic Repo Man you'll love it too.
4,You gotta duck,"I first saw thismovieon video almost 20 years ago, when I was an impressionable teenager. This film, along withRock 'N' Roll High School, helped make me a teenage punk fan. The soundtrack album still holds up well. Fans of old school punk will want to check it out."
5,Great Soundtrack....Captures Early 80's Punk Perfectly,"It's probably been 20 years since I last listened to ""Repo Man"", and I wasn't sure what to expect when I picked up the CD recently. As soon as Iggy Pop's ""Repo Man"" started pumping out of my speakers, I was instantly taken back to my mis-spent youth listening to bands like ""The Circle Jerks"", ""Suicidal Tendencies"", ""The Dead Milkmen"", ""The Meatmen"" etc. ""Repo Man"" manages to capture the raw energy of the early 80's punk scene, and the music manages to still sound fresh and raw today. (Maybe moreso in this day and age of ""sampling"" and lip-sync pop stars)""TV Party"", ""When The Sh** Hits the Fan"", ""Pablo Picasso"" & ""Mean Man"" are all stand-outs, and a great introduction to old-school punk. Now that I have re-discovered this disk, I can't imagine why it took me twenty years to finally upgrade my old scratchy LP to CD...but I'm glad I did."
5,mattchas,"If you're reading this, you've already seen the movie and know what to expect from the soundtrack. It's Repo Man. It's freakin' incredible. Buy one for yourself. Buy one for a friend so they will understand why you feel the need to quote this movie ad nauseum for no apparent reason. These songs encapsulate the early eighties california punk scene like no other compilation ever has or ever can. All the great bands are here, Fear, The Circle Jerks, Black Flag and mexicali flavored The Plugz. These aren't just some songs by these bands, these are the very best songs by these bands. Listening to this album can reconnect you to the wreckless spirit and asburdist tendencies that lie in the belly of an anarchistic youth you can never really outgrow."
4,O.k.,"Good book but you probably want to read it BEFORE Dead Sky, Black Sun of the Ultramarines series unless you like knowing the ending before you get there."
4,Fun with bad guys.,You got to see this story from both sides.My only issue with it was that there does not seem to be a sequel as of my reading this. I want to find out what happened to the character who becomes the replacement evil warmaster at the end.
4,fun airplane read,"If you can get past the concept of siege warfare in the far future, this ispretty fun. I thought the beginning is a bit disappointing, as the imperialforces are nothing more than overconfident, bumbling idiots, but thebalance shifts a bit as they gain their footing. The writing is prettystraightforward, and cliches abound (including a few that will makeyou cringe), but the action is brisk, and unrelenting."
2,ok but NOT great,hi i just got this strap and it says it has a pocket with a free pick. it dosen`t.its so small i can`t even mine into it!then it was packeged so dumbly that it took me 30 minutes to get it out.at least the look is cool.i would not reccomend you buy it.P.S.it was a rip off
3,"Nice, but smaller than expected.","Wanted to use these as luggage tags to recognize luggage. They are nice and durable but smaller than expected. For any Mickey fan though, probably worth the money."
3,Shirley Horn is not a talker!,"I buy Marian Mcpartland's Piano Jazz series more for insightful and often history revealing conversations than musical performances. In that sense, Shirley Horn is a mismatch to this kind of talk show program, simply because she speaks way too little. Marion's questions are much longer than Shirley's answers which conclude in a few words. She talked most (in disgust) when the discussion turned to the noisy audience during their live performances. I do sympathise with them but you find no new discovery in such talk. Not being a fan of Shirley, nor Marion as jazz pianist, the contained performances are so, so, even though Marion was clearly having a ball dueting with Shirley, while I remained frozen, unmoved. I wish Shirley sang more than two tunes. Her vocals sound a lot more eloquent than her piano and words."
2,Very Basic Introduction,"This book is okay as a basic intro to sewing, but is 90% about small canvas craft items you can make for your boat - and doesn't really get into sail repair at all.I picked up a few pointers from the book, but overall would recommend something more in-depth if you're serious about sail repair."
3,Sewing Canvas,"The book is OK if you are a novice.The sewing machine description shouldtalk more about the ""Walking Foot"" machine."
5,Great book for the DIY crowd.,I wanted to know how to do it myself. Buy a sailrite sewing machine or at least a leather palm and even men who never sewed in their lives can repair a rip in the mainsail.
2,Why the others suceeded this fails,"Why? I bought the first 3 cd's and it was a breath of fresh air, but on this it is easy to see the songs becoming very similar to not only one another but to the other cd's. I reccommend passing on this unless you really enjoyed the melodies of the past cd's b/c honestly, that's all I hear here.Ritchie truly stuck gold on finding Candice and the whole concept WAS original and truly forged an identity, but like a TV show entering Season 4 or 5, often drastic changes are needed or the format remains redundant, the latter being the case here. It is a decent cd, certainly I couldn't play the way Ritchie does or sing the way Candice does... unless I play the previous CDs:) I think Fires at Midnight is the best."
2,Yech!,"I bought this CD as my introduction to Blackmore's Night based on reviews from this site and Renaissance Magazine. What a mistake. Ritchie Blackmore's music composition skills and musicianship FAR outstrip Candace Night's lyric writing capabilities and the results are flat, insipid lyrics that detract from the gorgeous instrumentals. I applaud Blackmore for this foray into a totally different style of music, and his writing and playing is truly impressive in this new venue. But if he's going to continue with this experiment in renaissance pop, I recommend that he find someone who can compose more sophisticated lyrics to match his stellar music."
4,Does what it says it does,Good for carrying surfboards long distances. Pocket is a nice feature and the fact that you can use it for changing and as a towel makes this very useful for surf trips. Thought it was a little expensive and that's why it didn't get 5 stars.
5,Christian Rock Is The Way To Go,"I met this band just recently and they are really awesome! They are truely dedicated to what they believe in. This album says so. They sung their song ""Saturn"" at one of the concerts i went to and they changed Saturn to Heaven. I thought that was really cool! They are just an awesome band that rocks and let's others know that you can't stereotype christian music. It's not just that gospel stuff, it is anything that sings about God and belief. I really love this band! Check them out! :)-<--<:|8"
3,Not Their Best,"I have really enjoyed Skillet's recent albums so I decided to go back and check out their stuff from the early days. It is ok, but not on a par with their recent work.In particular, I think that their albumComatoseis superb. This one is average. The music ranges from quite mellow to very hard rock. The lyrics are all good. They definitely had a Christian message in the early days just as they do now.My recommendation would be to check out Comatose as mentioned above andArdent Worship: Skillet Livefirst."
5,Very Good Service,Everything arrived brand new and in the package as advertised. I choose expedite shipping and it took a little longer than I had hoped but probably because of the Easter weekend. Great communication from the company though. I was very satisfied with my purchase
4,Thoughtful but thin,"""I can"" is an incredible song! Its basically the christian version of Nirvana's ""Smells like Team Spirit"", only ""I can"" puts Nirvana in the dumps. The song is creative, heavy, and powerful all around. Sadly, thats where my enthusiasm ends. The rest of the CD is, lyrically, everything I expect from a Christian rock band, but the actual music aspect is thin and undefined. ""Saturn"" is an all around decent song, but it was really easy to tell this was their first CD."
4,"The song ""I Can"" just rocks and thats all there is to it !",I think that the cd is a definite ace and for even cooler christian rock check out driver eight on amazon.
2,is this the same band?,"I discovered Skillet because of their newest CD,Comatose. i loved it, loved it so much in fact that i decided to go out and get all of their CD's, starting with their oldest one. So I bought this one, and boy was I in for a disappointment. Is this the same Skillet that brought me to tears with their Comatose CD? Forget that; is it the same singer and songwriter? They don't sound anything like each other. I know that this band has undergone some big changes since this CD, but man oh man, it's hard to call this a Skillet CD at all. I love Skillet, I adore Skillets newer CD's, but this CD was nothing like their new ones.Replay value; very low."
2,plastic piece of junk,"I agree that the microscope is of awfully poor quality. Also the light is too sharp and it hurts to even look through the scope. I don't think the scope itself has any metal in it; it consists of that plastic that is made to look like metal. It isn't very expensive compared to other (real) microscopes, but it's definitely more of a novelty and just won't hold up long as a real tool."
1,Horrible,Horrible! Bought this for my daughter to help her interest grow and she is more frustrated (along with me) than anything. Terrible light / mirror - bulb goes off if you breathe on it wrong. Can't focus sharply on anything. Useless. Don't waste your money or time.
1,Poor choice for a budding scientist,"You get what you pay for. This is a toy, not an instrument to encourage and/or teach a child about science. I'd categorize it with the toy doctor kits on the market. If your child is really interested in microscopy, then get something with decent optics(glass) and a bit more heft(metal). I'm really surprised that Meade, a leading optics manufacturer, endorses this product. It's the reason I bought it."
1,Horrible!,"We bought this microscope as our son's first, and are utterly disappointed with it! The quality of the optics are extremely low, and are in fact so low as to render it useless. The light doesn't function at all. This item is barely useful as a prop/toy - don't waste your money."
1,Almost nothing on colored stones and crystals,"Having lived near Virginia Beach as a child, I admire Cayce's work, and was looking for a book on the qualities popularly ascribed to various semi-precious gemstones in order to be able to tell customers something about various agates and jaspers and lapis and the like if they ask.I was expecting quite a number of stones to be listed and their properties or qualities described, with a clear index.This book must have been produced long after Cayce's death. It only focused on a couple of stones, and was highly repetitive.This is a case of, if I had been able to flip through an actual copy of the book, I would not have wasted my time or money on it because it did not meet my needs in any way. I am not sure what audience WOULD find this information useful, but for someone seeking information on the properties of semi-precious stones, it was worse than useless."
2,Esoteric Writing at its Worst,"More than half this book is devoted to color, and the author has chosen to include a lot of scientific information, which makes for tedious reading. I found Mr. Campbell's application of color to the human glands incredible. ""And what color is your pituitary,"" one might ask. Huh? Edgar Cayce was a remarkable man and I have not read all his material certainly. But somehow I can't connect the power of color as written in this book with his writings. Too few facts about the power of stones and crystals, and many gemstones merit no mention. Frankly, I wish I had found this book in a library because my copy will be donated for their next sale."
4,"Edgar Cayce on the Power of Color, Stones, and Crystals","Lots of well researched information, great reference tool for gemstones, and color related energy information."
4,"Edgar Cayce On Power of Color, Stones and Crystals","I had read years ago quite a bit of Edgar Cayce material (my grandmother introduced me to it!), but I had never seen anything he said about crystals. I learned about it because of the previous book by Brett Bravo. Reading books concerning Edgar Cayce are generally a little more difficult to read but always worth the trouble!"
4,Excellent RnR - blended with punk influence,"I was very impressed with the way that this album came together combining rock & punk stylings to produce enjoyable, upbeat and fun music. There are no 5 star songs on this album, but there are 9 3 and 4 star songs.. in other words, its loaded. In that regard mthis album reminds me of Audio Adrenalines Underdog, not stylistically, but rather the fact that the album in full of good and very good songs, but no 5 star WOW songs and very few or no 1 or 2 star songs."
4,There Seems To Be Some Confusion,"For those of you that went to the many dances of Los Diablos in the United States and Mexico, this is your Los Diablos. This is the Los Diablos that received three (3) Grammy Nominations as best Mexican/American Performance. THIS IS NOT THE LOS DIABLOS DE ESPANA. If you want the Los Diablos de Espana, do not buy this album or you will be upset for no reason."
1,"the REAL ""los diablos"" are from spain","I agree with the other user, ""Los Diablos"" was a very good pop group from Spain during the 60s to 70's. there were very famous all over the spanish speaking countries in the world except for the U.S. of course...there is a lot of people that get confuse and buy this music from this ""other"" band and become very dissapointed.Los Diablos (From Spain) are the originals."
1,Estos no son Los Diablos,"Los Diablos, son un grupo Espa√±ol de la decada 60-70 , uno de los MEJORES!!! Temas propios, musica inolvidable y que no pasa de moda!"
3,"An okay story, but...","I have read through the novel The Sight, which touched my heart and left me almost crying at the end. Then I decided, mostly from reviews saying it was even better than The Sight. But when I actually read David Clement-Davies earlier animal fiction novel, Fire Bringer, I was left with a letdown.Many plot twists were expected, while one was plain morbid. Unlike The Sights' deaths, Fire Bringers' deaths were sudden, leaving me angry. Another thing in Fire Bringer was the prophecy. One of the lines was ""Sacrifice shall be his meaning."" Rannoch, the Larry-Stu main character, never sacrificed anything at all. I guess Clement-Davies' work will just get better with experience.Despite the good reviews, I would advise people to read The Sight instead of Fire Bringer. Though some parts were gripping, most were dragged out."
4,Give me this Mountain,"This was an inspiring book on the life of a Christian missionary doctor who spent much of her life in the Congo. It came at a time where political rebellions in the Congo occurred and this caused race relations and had a surprising impact on helen, her minstry and the black folks she worked with in some real dangerous situations. I was spoken to by the Holy Spirit and encouraged to be able to struggle and suffer more for Christ and to use prayer, bible study as keys to spiritual warfare in a real life experience through this book. It was very motivating, encouaging and a fun, fast read!"
5,An ethereal and emotionally overwhelming musical experience.,This album is essential listening for anyone who desires to have their intellect as well as their spirit challenged.
4,Iona - Celtic Progressive World Music,"Another Celtic influence progressive rock album from Ireland's Iona, ""Journey"" indeed takes the listener on a voyage to the heart of Ireland. Brimming with Celtic, World and progressive rock influences this album is a prime example of what Iona does best. Personally I like the slightly heavier direction their more recent albums have pursued, but on albums like this one the band can do the new age / world music thing as well as anyone. Joanna Hogg's vocals are flawless as always and Dave Bainbridge's guitars soar especially on the more upbeat numbers. If you like Iona's brand of Celtic progressive world music you will enjoy this album."
3,Network Management: Principles and Practice,Covers almost all topics in the Network Management Domain but is lacking in clarity
5,Excellent Book For Advanced Network Management Concepts,The book is excellent at revealing that real world usage of Network Management in a number of systems applications. If you are interested in getting an excellent book on advanced principles this is the book!
3,Good Condition - but old edition,"The book came very fast and in a very good condition. But I expected a newer edition than the one that I got, and since the content have not changed much to the newer editions, I decided to keep it. Next time the seller should state clearly the edition because the edition that I received is not the same as the picture shows."
4,Advanced Spanish Grammar,"DO NOT buy this book and Practical Spanish Grammer both. They are just about the same book, but this one is entirely in Spanish. I bought this book after already doing the entire Practical Spanish Grammer book thinking it was the next level or follow-up book, but it is NOT. This book starts at the beginning with the articles el and la then goes to basic conjugation of regular AR, ER, IR verbs, and so on ..., just like the first book. It may be a great book as the other reviews suggest which is why I bought it, but get in instead of the Practical Spanish Grammer book, not in addition to it or after you already read that one"
5,This really helped me,"I learned Spanish through total immersion (Peace Corps), not in the classroom. Through review, questioning, and trial and error, I had a solid foundation of the basics and I could communicate well in Spanish. This book was given to me the second year of my stay and really pulled together much of the advanced grammer rules I lacked. A few reviewers gripe about the vocabulary being too simple and some of the words are but the book is geared towards using the vocabulary with advanced tenses. The notes with the vocabulary are priceless as are the instructions in Spanish. I still review the book on occassion."
3,not very advanced,"It's very difficult to find a true advanced spanish book. This one is not very advanced. I leafed through it and it will not help me at all. I'm not fluent, but advanced. Someone out there... please make a good advanced book. This is set up in an interesting way, I like that. But not helpful for me. More like an intermediate book."
4,An asset for advanced students,"I am a teacher of Spanish as a second language and I encourage my advanced students to buy this book in order to have clear and simple explanations on those contents which often pose some difficulties to them. My website, which you can see at [...], can guarantee that this is a great tool for the serious Spanish learner."
3,Grammar,This text is a very good one to use after the second semester to review and/or learn good grammar because the student can obtain instant feedback to every question.
4,Colour illustrations on every JAAF unit in WWII,"This is the kind of book which may not be to everyones liking. Lots of pictures it does not have.What it contains basically covers the units and sub-units of the Japanese Army Air Force in World War 2. Orders of Battle for the major campaigns throughout the war are given, as well as colour illustrations of the vertical tails of the planes operated by every(yes every!) unit in the JAAF inventory. Different schemes for the different chutais(squadrons) are also shown(where applicable). In addition there are coulor plates for the every type of plane from selected units. Finally there are around 100 monochrome photographs showing the actual planes which the colour plates are taken from. An excellent resource for aircraft modellers or basically anyone with an interest in Japanese World War 2 army aviation."
4,"Fun, but not as good as the older ones","I own 6 of these electronic lightsabers. I just recently bought this green Luke Skywalker one for my son. It seems as if they make a different set of toy electronic lightsabers each year. This time, they extended the blade about 6 inches over the length of the ones from last year, and used a thinner plastic for the blade.I know that you're not supposed to duel with them, but the new one cannot even come close to holding up like the old ones. I duel all the time with my kids. This new one is already bending when clashed... I would recommend hunting down an older one like Obi-wan's, Anakins, or Count Dooko's.. I can verify that those three are especially strong and are duel-worthy and have worked perfectly through 4 sets of batteries so far."
5,One of my favorite all-time books on Christian faith!,"""I believe passionately that christianity is a way of life, not a theological system with which one must be in intellectual agreement..."" Thus the author takes many Christian beliefs/doctrines and discusses them from a minimalist point of view, making a strong case that loyalty to and love for Christ and his spirit go hand in hand with a rejection of much theological dogma and creed. Traditionalists may be shocked! Highly recommended! This, along with C.S. Lewis' ""Mere Christianity,"" ought to be required reading for all Christians."
1,"Nice try, but the book's a failure","While Christians do doubt, and Agnostics do wonder, can anyone truly be a ""Christian Agnostic""? The terms 'Christian' and 'Agnostic' seem to be mutually exclusive when one is describing a position of religious belief. Weatherhead's ambivalence and misreading of biblical texts mars the occasional insightful comment he renders. I am sympathetic to his openness in questioning and discussing these issues, but he seems poorly read and very underinformed in resource consultation. The word 'uneducated' is perhaps a bit too harsh to give to someone who has their doctorate, so perhaps 'limited education' would better describe why Dr. Weatherhead has not authored a successful book."
4,the three of you blend well!,"Your voices are like one, the blend is incredible. I heard that you did a lot of acappella music. Would like you to do an album with more acappella to bring out the incredible blend you have that background music can cover up."
4,Good gospel music,"This is one of the best gospel CDs on the market. I highly recommend it. I have sung ""In the Presence of Jehovah"" in church and want to sing ""It Didn't Come to Stay, It Came to Pass"" next. Only one flaw on the CD. A skip in the beginning of one song that is hardly noticeable. Saw this group in concert in Mississippi. They have a great testimony on how their family lost everything in life materialistically and all they had left were their voices. They inherited their grandparents farm, but their parents didn't know how to be farmers. They knew music! It is a fantastic album...most songs written by one of the siblings."
5,Great Start,"I'm just getting into the world of Director, and this book has been my guide. It is written in an entertaining manner, (thankfully not overly cute,) and is making my learning experience an enjoyable one so far. Each lesson is laid out in an easy to read manner and features quick quizzes through out the text, designed to make sure that the important concepts are driven home. I recommend it for other readers looking to begin their Director education!"
3,Presidential Flag,"This is a very nice looking flag, unfortunately the one I received was not well made.The grommets literally came off the in my hand when I took the flag down to wash it, thus I had to dispose of the flag because it was no longer useable. Lucky for me that I had an older Presidential Seal Flag to replace it.I wouldn't mind paying more money for a nice nylon flag versus the thin polyester ones that are being sold on line."
4,The Seal,The product came faster than expected. The flag is made of good weather proof material and is well made to with stand strong wind.
2,Typewriters?,"I bought this book because the library's copy was stolen last October. The thief needn't have bothered. The NYS Keyboard Specialist civil service test includes questions on keyboarding -- as in computer keyboarding. This book's section on keyboarding pertains soley to typewriters. The book also is eloquent about how electronic typewriters are so much faster and easier to use than manual typewriters. Are you kidding me? Spelling and grammar sections are useful, up to a point, as this book is riddled with layout mistakes and typos. This book was not cheap, but is cheaply made. The binding is plastic spiral, but the pages also have 3-hole binder-type punches. What a waste of money."
1,"Review of ""Weight Watchers New Program Cookbook""","This book is essentially about describing over 600 recipes created in the seventies by the chefs and home economists who staffed the Food Research Department of Weight Watchers International. The main claim made in the volume is that these will help people lose weight and learn to eat properly.The chapters are organized according to food categories, e.g., fruit, legumes and vegetables.Problem is the Weight Watchers food program (including menu plans) lacks a scientific understanding of the basic principles of human physiology and, thus, will never help its followers reach a state of healthy balance. For instance, the book does not even mention transfatty acids."
3,SOMEWHAT BORING AND KINDA STALE 5.75 OUT OF 10,"Hexen looks and plays almost identically to Doom except it's not as fun and it uses ancient weaponry and magic instead of guns. This game could've been deamed a classic, but unfortunately boredom mars the experience. Yes, you will find yourself bored and confused as to what you're supposed to do. The enemy designs look pretty cool, but the level designs are bland and uneventful. Speaking of enemies, they're pretty stupid... and I play the game on Archimage the hardest difficulty. Your missions are not very exciting along with the use of your weapons and magic, so you'll never feel like you rule all when you do with your powers as you feel in the Xbox 360 masterpiece Bioshock. Just go play Doom instead, unless you're looking for a Doom ripoff(If so, please avoid Zero Tolerance)."
1,This makes Doom look like brain surgery.,I could only tolerate this game for a total of 5 minutes before I started having suicidal tendencies. When I think of the mediocre graphics I would rather play with a card board box.
2,"A classic, yes... but...",Short and simple. Playing this game reminded me of the first games to come out when we crawled out of DOS and jumped into WinDoze. A decent enough first-person shooter - but the graphics are bad enough that I haven't played it ages. What a waste for a 64 bit machine.
3,Dr. TMS,"The least bad of the several conservative revisionist histories of the Great Depression. Professor Smiley ignores less of reality than, say, Rothbard, Power or Schlaes. A potentially useful read for students of the Depression and macroeconomic policy."
4,"Fact Heavy, Sometimes Misses the Big Picture","This book is incredibly fact heavy, but sometimes it misses the big points about the period. These points can be discerned, but sometimes it takes a few paragraphs or pages to get the point. I think the author wrote from the perspective that the reader already knew quite a bit about the period, and thus didn't explicitly state the underlying ideas in many cases. Overall, it was informative and worth reading, especially if you are already knowledgeable about the period."
4,Reality,"Rethinking the Great Depression is a highly informative book. Its importance derives from the widespread misconceptions regarding the Great Depression. Americans are usually taught that Hoover wrecked the economy with Laissez Faire policies, and FDR saved us with The New Deal. Smiley demonstrates that absurdity of what we are usually taught. This book should be used in every high school history class, as opposed to the mythology that so often passes for history. This is an effective antidote to the phony history advanced by Arthur Schlesinger."
5,"It is a giant giraffe, what isn't there to like about it?","I'll keep this short - it's a giant giraffe. It's very well built and it's pretty great. If you want a giant giraffe, you can't go wrong with this. If you don't want a giant giraffe, then I guess you won't want this."
3,Buyers remorse.....,"I got this enormous giraffe for my 1 year old for Christmas. When we took it out of the huge box it came in the front legs were kind of angled back a little so the giraffe wouldn't even stand up unless you pried the front legs out a little and set it down, and it still looked funny and was easy to tip over. After about a day, we got buyers remorse and since it appeared to be faulty anyways, we sent it back for a refund. Thank goodness for Amazon's great return policy!"
3,Lovely,Beautiful animal and fun for younger kids. Very tall my son calls it the biggest ever. Overall not a bad buy.
2,"Isn't as tall as u would think, only use is decorative. :( legs get bent and it's not going to stand again","Disappointed, they use the kid in the picture to make it seem taller - also it's not as big around as the picture seems, it's super light weight - if the legs get bent by your kid, it will not stand again, it is so light you will need to protect it from children actually so as to not ruin it. For use as decorative use only. Too expensive for quality too."
5,The kids loved the giraffe,I bought two of these giraffes' for Christmas presents for my nieces. They went crazy when they opened the giraffe. The 1.5 year old loved it as much as the 5 year old. Even the adults were shocked when they saw it. I cant say enough good things about it. It was a hit at the Christmas party. It arrived two days after I ordered it (with free ground shipping the week before Christmas)! Gotta love Amazon.
4,Great,Excellent quality. He is lovely and soft with a beautiful face and a really nice size. I would highly recommend this to anyone.
5,Cutest Stuffed Animal Ever.,Just arrived today in perfect condition. He is going in my nursery. We have a jungle theme for our son who is due in October. I saw this Giraffe in a local Border's store and it was priced at 110. I got this item on Amazon for 62. Great deal! And this Giraffe is too cute.
5,I love this giraffe,"I purchased this giraffe from amazon (with amazon prime shipping) two days before thanksgiving when it was 50% off. It was definately the biggest and cutest thing under (well next to) the christmas tree. Everyone loved it, especially the kids."
4,big happy,"my daughter wanted 'a life sized baby giraffe' for her birthday and was blown away when her wish came true. this big giraffe has a great wow factor at a reasonable price. good quality, too!"
5,Such an awesome gift!!,My daughter and I saw this at the Zoo and at the time could not afford to grab it up. I found it on Amazon and was tooo thrilled!! I ordered it on a Tuesday thinking it would not reach us in time for Valentines Day but it very much did!! The look on her face was one of those priceless moments. It came in a huge box and wrapped in plastic. Very clean and new. We both love love love her!!
5,Giraffe Plush,Loved the giraffe! It was a gift for my daughter's baby shower. It looks great in the nursury. It lives up to claims! :)
5,Wow!,"This sure brought the ""wow!"" factor to my 16 yr old daughter! She loves giraffes, so kind of a joke we got her this giraffe! She loved it!!!! Very sturdy! Very tall!"
5,PERFECT,I didn't buy this giraffe as anything more than decoration for a new baby boy's room. It fits that purpose quite well. I do think it is well made with a non-threatening look as reviewed by another person. The eyelashes are wonderful!
4,Great Value!,My daughter really wanted this giraffe for her birthday. Amazon.com was the best value around!! I found this product $25.00 cheaper than in the stores AND the shipping was fast and excellant. My daughter loved her giraffe and now wants the whole wild animal collection from Melissa and Doug.
5,Amazing Giraffe,"I don't have a picture as I sent this as a gift, but everyone at the new mother's house says this giraffe is amazing!!! They also comment that it is adorable and pacifying and not intimidating or scary considering it's size. A BIG HIT!!!"
5,Beautiful!!,"Beautiful!! We love this giraffe! It is truly wonderful and makes us smile whenever we look at it. A word of caution, however, about the head. It feels as though the head has a base formed with a styrofoam type product, unlike the rest of the body. I have my doubts that the head would hold up to much pressure. This is the only reason I've given the giraffe a 4 star rating for durability. The more fragile feeling base material does allow the head to have more of a lifelike appearance then if it had been made completely of a softer material. I would rate the rest of the giraffe's body with 5 stars for durability.Melissa and Doug Giraffe - Plush"
5,christmas present,"i bought this for my 10 year old daughter, i know some people think this is just for little kids but she loves this and plays with it daily it is beautiful and we were very satisified"
5,Awesome,"Got this for my daughter before she was born. She loves Geoffrey (the giraffe) and it's still a big part of her life now 3 years later. Geoffrey is her ""best friend""...one of the best buys we've made on Amazon."
4,Its cool to look at....,"This stuffed animal definitely caught my eye when I saw it online and when it came to my house. It just stands by itself in the living room, but my daughter loves it and has even named him Robert. Since she is only 25 pounds, she sits on the Giraffe's back and holds on to his neck. Its the cutest site and is truly a Kodak moment."
5,Wonderful,"Bought this for a nursery. It looks great, arrived very quickly. My older son loves it as well, will probably end up with a second one. Great price as well. The local Children's museum has it for almost $40 more."
5,Love this giraffe!,"My family loves this giraffe! I wanted to fill up a corner in my daughter's room and was looking for something tall. I researched giraffes on the internet and found this one to be tall enough and affordable. I liked it more than I thought I would, and I was shocked at how much my daughter and husband liked it too. When we first opened the packaging, my daughter squeeled with laughter and ran around the giraffe, hugging it and smiling. Every night we let our daughter hug the giraffe's long neck before bed. This toy was the best dollar for dollar purchase to date."
3,giraffe,My kids loved the giraffe. I just did not think it was pretty enough for a nursery. The face was a little scary for me.
4,another cute animal,I cannot wait for my daughter to see this on Christmas. She will love it. Its nice quality for the money which makes it a great value. I'd order more animals if I had more room.
3,Value?,"Nice enough product, priced questionably. I would purchase again because it was exactly what I needed for a special gift."
5,As durable as it is beautiful,"I bought this for my son years ago when he was about 1 year old. He is turning 7 soon and he still loves his ""mommy giraffe"". It has held up very well and at times has taken a beating but still looks the same it did the day we it arrived at our home. I was very impressed with the quality, durability, and the detail. It is a very beautiful and sweet-looking giraffe. I think it was well worth what we spent on it back in the day when it cost double what you can now buy it for on Amazon."
5,Jumbo giraffe is wonderful,This is the largest and most lifelike animal that I have ever ordered online. I couldn't believe it is about 5' tall! My son was absolutely thrilled. He thinks it is like being at the zoo! I also think the price is reasonable considering what this would cost at a mall or gift shop!
5,Amazingly realistic and well made!,"This giraffe is really great. It is sturdy, tall, and very well-made. The 'face' of the giraffe is terrific - full of personality!"
4,amazing aww moment,The kids are amazed at the size of the giraffe. Small children are able to sit on the giraffe and love to hug the huge stuffed animal.
5,Excellent for imaginative play!,"I purchased this item for my grandson's 5th birthday and it was a tremendous hit! The quality is wonderful and my grandson was thrilled to have a ""life-sized"" giraffe for his animal collection! As a fan of the zoo, he says he wants to grow up to work there and ""take care of the giraffes"", so this toy was the ideal choice for a birthday surprise and didn't fail to amaze!"
5,Ummm....,"Of course, I'm really happy with my AVG purchase, but I thought I was buying 2 years (24 months) of protection. However, it turns out I only have protection until September 2010. Since I bought this in April, that means I will have to renew my protection in only 17 months, instead of 24. That was a little disappointing to me."
1,AVG Girsoft is Dishonest,"I currently have AVG 7.5 version which supposedly has just expired. When I ordered it I asked for CD back-ups and never got them. Girsoft insisted I never ordered them even though I have an e-mail from them indicating I did order the CD. Now, 8.0 version? I think the company is dishonest, you can't speak with anyone in person over the phone, and the company is located somewhere in a remote part of the world."
4,"Good protection, But slows the start-up downnnnnnnnnn",I think it works well but really slows the start-up down. You have to sign on then walk away so it can do it's thing. Don't be in a hurry.
1,Too Busy,"The AVG is not for me. It is too busy & takes over my computer. It has slowed it down and stopped it completely. First off at installation it said that the installation cd was out of date, so go to the website. At the website there was no new installation without another sale. The license # wouldn't be accepted. After about 12 times, it took it. I couldn't talk to anyone until the license had been accepted. It was a huge hassel & I am really thinking of uninstalling it. I am not a fan of this anti-virus program."
1,Worst Customer Service Ever,"I purchased AVG internet security last year with a 2 years contract.In the beginning of this year I got a worm from MSN that had me questioned AVG ability to protect my computer. I than was forced to reformat my computer, which lead me to having to reinstall my AVG again.The only problem is that my old password did not work anymore, but I have already purchased the 2 years license for 1 computer!I tried checking AVG website and could not find the correct answer that addresses my issue.I than emailed AVG customer service twice.... that was over one month ago. Until today there has been no answer at all other than the automated answer: ""Thank you for your email,..."".Thank you AVG, you have given me a new direction in life.I will never, ever buy your useless product again.And oh,.. not only useless product, also fake customer service."
3,AVG Virus Protection,"This product was exactly as advertised, and was received quickly after payment was made. Works great, although it does slow down my computer during virus scan. Also, the firewall is a little difficult to work with."
2,Not as good as advertised,"Grisoft AVG Internet Security - 2 Year SubscriptionThey advertise that it is quick and doesn't slow down your computer. The updates are fine, but if you follow their recommendation to run it every 4 hours, you will find that your computer will slow way down. Further, on a computer that doesn't have much on it, the scan takes 2.5 hours each time, meaning that your computer is constantly being slowed down. It has caused my computer to 'freeze', not only when surfing the Internet but also when trying to do something locally.I would not buy this product again unless AVG finds a way to speed up the scans and only scans programs that have been accessed since the last scan, minimizing the opportunity for the computer to slow down.Try their free download first and then run your computer while the scan is happening and when it is not, doing the same tasks (your normal functions) before buying."
1,Sometimes IE can't connect to web site,"I use AVG IS on 2 PCs, both have the same problem, SOMETIMES a newly opened IE window can't connect to web site(even localhost) while ping and other web applications working fine. I did a lot of seach on internet, try to find out the problem and did some changes on my PC, finally found out it's because of AVG. After uninstall AVG, they are back to normal. So I'm only using AVG Anti-Virus part now. And my PC got much faster."
5,Good Product! Great Price!,I purchased the AVG Internet Security software as a Christmas gift for a friend. It arrived very quickly and was the perfect gift for our friend!
1,AVG INTERNET SECURITY,THE AVG INTERNET SECURITY DID NOT WORK. THE CODE NUMBER WOULD NOT RELEASE THE SOFTWARE TO WORK. ASKED FOR MY MONEY BACK.
1,"don,t buy this sofware it is horrible","i installed avg internet security and then 2 days later i had no internet. had to call the Fios tech support and they told me that my internet ipv4 address is just and my internet should be working so i uninstalled the AVG internet security and my internet came back and this software is horrible i recommend Adaware pro 2008 you get a lot better service plus more protection that,s why it cost more $49.99 with amazon.com plus free shipping that is a good deal"
1,Computer Invasion !,"You're better off with a virus than this POS. Two days after loading this tumor it was doing an update and froze my computer like a two week old penguin turd. The TWO days it was alive were really annoying. Way too busy, not allowing you the use of your own computer. Had to run a recovery on my system. Still not done restoring. Worst product ever !AVG>> YOU OWE ME MONEY ! Click this !"
1,Blake's Review,"Unrelavent to the social and political situation in Britain at the time, scattered information and no attribution."
4,Great Training Book,"Our association distributed this book to participants at a training for new supervisors. They were very enthusiastic and their agency heads found The New Supervisor's Survival Manual equally useful. It offers practical advice and the case studies accurately reflect the situations new supervisors often face. In fact, one of our member agencies ordered additional copies to give to all supervisors, experienced as well as new. We highly recommend The New Supervisor's Survival Manual."
3,Follow up to yellow book,"Not as revolutionary as the first, but a must have for all skiers.Get it. Watch the video. Go skiing. Have fun."
1,There is something wrong...,"I went through some of Mr HH ideas and watched him skiing on youtube. I could not be amazed more. I am not an instructor so cannot comment on his teaching methodology, but some of Mr HH technic ideas are just plain wrong. The way he carves skies is just how a competent skiier who never learned carving did it a few years ago. His ideas of using an inside ski to initiate a turn, what is this supposed to be? He almost falls demonstrating it on youtube on the gentlest of slopes. All over the world there are people who do not know moder technic and teach others. But they rarly write books and do dvds. If you want to understand how skiing works, there is no shortcut I am afraid. Go for Ultimate Skiing by Ron Le Master.Do not get me wrong. Mr HH does many things rather well. These are just modern skies he gets totaly wrong and tries to reivent the wheel I guess."
2,Time-warp??,"Is this a time-warp back to the very early nineties??I've worked myself through this DVD three times, and I've had to pay really close attention to find any small point I can work with. Well, I've found some very few things, and not all of them new. But I can't show this to anyone, it's just too embarrassing. -- Swedish magazines gave two-page lectures that far surpassed this in 1999, and this is like looking back to a time well before that. People that haven't been skiing for fifteen years skies like this. I wonder why? Perhaps because it locks you to gentle soft slopes?"
5,Javascript All in one Book.,"If you want to master Javascript and read just one book, then this must be the book you want to buy. Covers A-Z, detailed. If you are beginning on AJAX then this book is must read if you are Javascript beginner. 5 Stars."
4,Extensive reference on Javascript,O'Reilly books are always of high quality. At over 900 pages this book is a very complete reference. It has the functional organization characteristic of reference books. The answers are here but it's not the place to go to learn Javascript from scratch. I find tutorials that are project oriented much more approachable for the beginner. Once you've used Javascript to solve some basic needs this reference will become a great tool.
4,"Excellent resource, but needs examples","I have to add my vote to those who feel this is an excellent resource, but that far too much important information (regular expressions, for example) is discussed in a narrative style that only hints at the actual syntax. Once you know the syntax, this book undoubtedly is a treasure -- but now I'm stuck having to find yet another resource to actually teach me how to make use of javascript (if I'd known, I would have read this book *after* doing some good turtorials)."
2,Not what I had hoped for corporate IE 6.0 intranets,"JavaScript is not well organized nor standardized which makes it inherently confusing to work with at an advanced level. But the organization of this book does not help matters. Too often I find myself with book marks in 5+ places as part of researching a fairly basic technique. Some of the examples are overly complex and not real-world. If your customer is standardized on IE 6.0 there are some things missing (contenteditable and document.selection for example). The subtitle ""The Definitive Guide"" may not be warranted."
3,Decent Definitive Guide,"This a very decent reference and so-so tutorial of JavaScript. If you're doing JavaScript you definitely need this definitive guide, definitely."
2,Not for beginners,"You'd better know what javascript is and how it works before buying this book...... this is not a beginners book. It's written with ""code lingo"" and it all sounds greek to me. Thank goodness I didn't pay full price because this book was no help at all. I just finished two courses in HTML and got A's in both. I then decided to explore Javascript but this was not the book to buy. I don't know how the reviews I read couldn't have warned us of the complexity of the book."
4,This book has saved me many times.,"A great book which has helped me out so many times. If you live, eat and breath JavaScript then you probably don't need this book anymore. However I find that I use such a mix of technologies; Lotus Notes, LotusScript, Java, C, C++, HTML, XML etc, that remembering 100% of the syntax just isn't realistic. That's where this book comes into play as it always seemed to contain just the right information to keep me going."
2,Dissapointed,"I bought this because I have always had great products from Moen. Unfortunately I did not luck out his time. The handles are made from a brittle plastic which does a pretty good job of imitating metal. My main grip is that when the plastic handles are placed on the levers it is impossible to get them at 180 degrees from each other, this leaves the handles cock-eyed when everything is turned off. Not what I expected from Moen."
1,Watch Band NOT Adjustable,"Nice looking watch, but the BAND is not adjustable at home. It would need special tools and there are no instructions provided. I consider my wife to be of average size and it was far to big for her wrist. Would not purchase this item unless you know it is for someone with a big wrist."
1,not a work horse,"This utility pouch can't handle the rigors of everyday work. Fell apart under the strain of carrying wirenuts and MC connectors. The tool pockets have fallen apart and not having mutually exclusive pockets is a huge minus. The working electrician should steer clear of this one and either get a cheap nylon pouch or go leather. It's priced like a leather, but built like a disposable shopping center throw-away."
4,Solid Opening,"I never read any JSA before reading this and I have to say I enjoyed it. The art was nothing amazing but, it didn't turn me away. IN the story a New Doctor Fate is set to take over the mantle. The JSA is charged with finding the one who is to become Fate. The story just keeps flipping you over and over again until the big conclusion. A good read just wish I could track down a copy of the second volume."
4,JUSTICE FOREVER!,"JSA: JUSTICE BE DONE is a successful reboot for comicdom's original super-hero team. Writers James Robinson and David Goyer deserve a lot of credit for not only coming up with a good story, but infusing it with the necessary characterization and respect for the team's glorious (and far-reaching) history. The artwork is dynamic and the story streamlined and exciting, culminating in the birth of a new Dr. Fate and a sorcerous showdown with a truly fearsome evil wizard. The revamped JSA features a strong mix of old-timers and up-and-comers, hopefully satisfying fans of the Gold and Silver Age heroes while still giving the new generation of fans some of their own. Though I would have probably preferred a story that simply reintroduced the earliest JSA, that wasn't going to happen in DC's revamped Post-Crisis continuity and what we end up with is still an excellent story with the foundation in place for many more to follow."
3,I know it's informitive but...,"Ok, I know that this guide has alot of secret info and all that but let's think for a second. it's $75!! FAQ's on the net (Especially Gamefaqs.com) have equal or greater than this information for FREE!Sorry to be a critic but, seriously. Anyway, the game isn't that hard. I beat it completely and never used a guide. It's quite easy, even comparable to Animal Crossing.So, think before you spend $75 on information you don't really need or can get for free. -_-"
5,Very Handy! A good investment!,"Not only is it all orginized, neat, and made much cuter with the pictures and borders and such but it is all correct! I thought of saving myself some money by using online gaming sites but I was presented with wrong infromation that really messed up the nice pace I was moving at. Websites often also left out important details or somthiing like that. I found this book VERY HELPFUL in keeping my infromation clean, collected and fun! Enjoy!"
3,just a correction,"i really think this book is a bit of a waste of money, since the info is scant at best and a little frustrating. also, lets be honest, you can find almost everything in it online anyways..oh yes,one other thing.. you do get a better fishing pole if you have more than 50 fish in your pond, you just need to have an empty space to carry another tool, so just put something away in your toolbox.. see?..thats what i mean by frustrating, it just doesn't tell you enough"
4,-It has the basics,"MY NAME IS DREW AND I THINK THIS A GREAT GUIDE! IT IS MISSING A FEW THINGS BUT NOTHING MAJOR. THIS GUIDE TELLS YOU ALL DATES FESTIVALS, AND EVENTS THAT HAPPEN. IT GIVES YOU AWESOME TIPS ON HOW TO MAKE YOUR FARM BETTER. IT BASICALY WALKS YOU THROUGH THE WHOLE ENTIRE GAME, SO IF YOU FOLLOW THE GUIDE AND DO WHAT IT TELLS YOU TO DO YOU CANT LOOSE."
1,Avoid at all costs,"This guide is very lacking in almost every aspect. There is not enough detail in certain areas, while some scenarios are just glossed over.A very unsatisfactory effort, in my mind. It seemed the author(s) just wanted to finish the book and not have to worry about providing much detail."
3,They Died With Custer,"Very interesting book. Learned a lot. Some information was repeated (word for word) in different sections of the book. Seemed like it was added just to stretch the size of the book, or at least someone wasn't paying attention. What was new was interesting, what was repeated was boring. I would recommend this book, it is definitely worth reading."
2,Reads Like a Textbook,"This is an extremely difficult book to read. Not for the details of what happened to the men of the 7th, but because of the absolute lack of coherent presentation. Written by scientist, the book bores the reader to death with numbers, data roll outs and theoretical mumbo jumbo. Countless pages of bone analysis that only a coroner could understand or appreciate, followed by a lack of resolution. Imagine several pages describing the bones in a grave followed by a list of possible victims and a close that basically says we don't know who this body was or how he died or if he was.....you get the idea. In the end, the book adds nothing to our knowledge of the battle. It reads like a catalogue. Without any attempt to engage or involve the reader, this is the same type of textbook that made anthropology 1-a such a treat."
3,IS-IS Implemenations - but not for CCIE,"I purchased this book as I hoped it would enhance my knowledge for the CCIE - unfortunately I was wrong. The best part of the book are the first few chapters - Chapter 3 & 4. This is a good refresher for ISIS. But, as the book goes on, the continuity is lost. Particularly, the last few chapters on troubleshooting ISIS are of no real value. If you are one of the rare networks that uses IS-IS, you probably need this book. If you don't use IS-IS, then don't bother!I give this book 3 pings out of 5:!!..!"
3,catchy cut,"this was one of those cuts that i blasted big time for a minute. Ricky,Ricky that was the catch phrase for a minute. this song has a cool catchy groove. the song has a late 80's early 90's vibe. it works."
1,Not for me,"was very disappointed in this scent. Smells like that old woman's perfume (you know that one that sits right in front of you at church). I couldn't wash it off fast enough. Went back to make sur the box said ""For Men"" and it did. I guess I am one of the few who hated it but definitely test it before buying online and believeing the reviews. Live and learn I guess."
2,"same program, new box","Fritz is by far the best product of it's kind on the market. But Fritz 9 is no upgrade from Friz 8. Everything looks and feels exactly the same. The engine (contrary to popular belief) is no stronger. If you own Fritz 8, don't waste your money on 9, very little has changed. Just another software company, releasing a slightly tweaked ""upgrade"" and charging $40 for it. If you don't own any version of Fritz, I'd still recommend 8 because you can find it cheaper."
3,"Plenty challenging, but...","but...the interface needs serious work in the user-friendly department. I would much rather study chess, than how to take advantage of all of Fritz's many features - which the manual does a markedly poor job of explaining. A few more helpful dropdown menus, plainer explanations, and features (for example - loading opening books, cleaning up user files, difficulty of the ""coach"" feature - advice offered at unpredictable and unuseful times) would go a long way.Chessmaster 10th looked much more appealing, but I got this cause I just couldn't ignore all the technical problem reviews associated with it (Chessmaster)."
4,Worth buying,Fritz is great software for the any chess player. Many features make Fritz a good investment for anyone who wants to improve their game.
1,Disappointed,I was very disappointed to find this was a spiral bound publication as I was expecting a book. The information included in it was stuff that was pretty standard and nothing helpful. It did not help me at all with my Focus Groups. It is not really a step by step guide but rather an advertisement for Bader.
3,"Was OK, not best in the series","This book was pretty good. Not the best that has come in the Noble Dead series though. Because the cast of main characters has grown from the original 2 main, there seems to be a lot more random scene skipping and thoughts from other characters. It kind of breaks up the read. Finding out more about Leesil was good though. I enjoyed it but I was thinking it would be better."
1,Traitor to the series,"I am disapointed.I could not wait for this installment to go paper back so I figured I would buy the hardback, its a good series right? I think its still a good series but this particular book I could have done without. If you skipped this book entirely you would not miss anything in the story line. Here is the book broke down in what you need to know form. The guys enter a city looking for Leesils mother and leave the city. That's pretty much it. They don't even leave the place better off than it was. I read fiction for happy endings I go to movies for happy endings. I am not a ""deep"" guy. In this book an evil despot is gotten rid of but Hendee makes sure you know another despot, probably just as bad is going to take over. And guess what. Mom is still lost. Thanks. But no thanks. I am still a fan, but I am going to forget this book."
2,Strange,I found the story complicated and confusing. The Merlin character was completely bizarre. I kept watching to see if it would get better and it never did.
4,great purchase,this item came without the cd but otherwise it was in great condition and in a timely manner.
3,Good Start to Singing,I think this book is great but it doesn't help all too much. Just too warn some people thta this won't help if you don't practice every day with the practice CD.
5,Sing like a star!,"This book is excellent and came with a CD to practice with. It has addressed all the problems that I have with lots of good exercises to make or assist you in changing your voice. Contains help with breathing, vibrato, explains and demonstrations for chest, middle and head voice and more. The CD also contains a warm-up. It has exercises for both male and female voices."
1,Disc not included,This book was recommended because it had a great CD that you could sing along with for the exercises. The CD was not included in my order. I looked for the description that might tell me that the very low used price meant that the CD would not be included but did not find it mentioned.
5,The Best of Baki the Grappler Animation,The Baki the grappler is great fighting anime and great collection of Baki the grappler box set. The best animation
2,Ugh!,Loved the idea but too hard for me and my 11 year old. Granted we had never done any kind of a model before. The instructions are TOO VAGUE! We found it to be very difficult to match up pieces. We eventually quit without finishing.
3,Spirited Away on steroids,"Imagine a Batman-like superhero who did nothing to actually stop crime but showed up every now and then to trash half the city in a battle with some super-villain, killing innocent bystanders in the process...that is Karas. Some stories are best kept untold (or partially told and left to imagination) and I can't help but get that feeling after watching the conclusion of the Karas story. Karas is a grand presentation of a lame, shallow story. The production values are very high and the action scenes are very enjoyable but as any anime fan knows, a great anime cannot stand on high budget visuals alone without good storytelling. The second half of the Karas story maintains the same fast-paced action sequences but the scenes seem to be just a little less polished and the overall presentation just a little less engaging than the first half. Overall I was disappointed with the conclusion of the story and the long delay of its release adds to the disappointment."
2,BORING!!!!!,"I saw the first Karas movie and it was HIGH QUALITY ACTION-PACKED!!!!But this one has only two action scenes!! The rest is blah,blah,blah.The first action scene was cool but the guy doesn't turn into Karas, he only use his sword. The second action scenes were also cool but is set at the end of the movie.If you like the story the buy the two of them but if you only looking for action like I do then buy only the first one.Adios."
3,Why must I give titles to everythin?!. It's annoying.,"Pretty animation, unimpressively violent. Eh.I watched it on recommendation and it's pretty much the standard ""fighting robot anime"" (if anyone uses the word ""mecha"", I will bean them). Entertaining, but has about as much depth as a punctured kiddy pool.Don't be too surprised at the ending; I certainly wasn't."
1,Karas - The Disappointment,"""Karas - The Prophesy"" is excellent.It gets better every time that I experience it.It had some sense of balance, an equilibrium.It was only a matter of time before I checked out""Karas - The Revelation"".What a mess!There was the foundation for a very interesting plotand the animation was technically excellent.The producers must think that art is throwingall kinds of crazy stuff at people and wowingthem with sensory overload.I felt psychologically abused by the end of the movie.2 stars for expertise in animation and0 stars for the end product yields a1 star review for the movie.Hoping that these animation geniuses will usetheir talents for worthwhile projects in thefuture. What a waste if they don't."
5,My favorite all-time book!,"William the Watchcat is the best childrens' book I've ever read. As a child, I read this story a million times. Now that I'm beginning to plan a family of my own, I want a new copy of this book. The pictures are fabulous and the story is fun for children and adults. There are some important lessons taught about the power of love (including a pet's love for its master) and the importance of being kind to others. The love story between the two people is especially heart warming. This is a book that should be in every child's library!"
2,Equus speedometer....don't wast your money,"Please people, dont wast your hard earned money the way I did.. Save up and purchase the best you can afford! I purchased this item with the advice I read in a large automotive magizine, Come on, seriously, what a cheap piece of garbage. And they do not even include all the required parts to fully install. All that must be purchased seperatly from the Equus company, that's if you can ever get anyone on the phone, or to even reply to an e mail. Very poor quality product, and very poor customer service.... will never use their products again!"
2,Disappointed,"I bought this doll for my daughters, who were adopted from Russia as babies. I wanted them to learn a few words in their native language, which I don't speak. I was hoping the doll would teach them some very basic Russian words/phrases (please, thank you, hello, etc). Anna speaks way too quickly and her voice is garbled, so you are unsure of the exact pronunciation. My children did not learn from her and were not interested in her as a toy either."
4,great gift,I purchased this as a gift for my girlfriends daughter. They adopted their daughter from Russia and want her to retain her native language while learning English. Theis doll was the perfect gift. She loves dolls and this one speaks clearly and I couldn't stop myself from playing with it in the box before I gave it to her. Great learning tool-kids always learn better when they don't realize that they are learning.
4,More challenging than expected,I truly liked this one it was more challenging than expected (this is a plus for me).
3,Plenty of Better Books Out there - Desperately needs updating.,"I requested this book for Christmas based on the reviews and that a LHBS said it was at a technical level for someone with a chemistry degree. The book also describes itself a a complete book. Neither of these statements are true. This book should be described as an overview of brewing and the brewing industry.Homebrewers will get a lot more information from books by John Palmer, Ray Daniels, and Charlie Papazian if you are a beginner. Although I was disappointed to find Greg Noonan's book was not about lager, it provides a lot more detail than this book.Possibly the biggest problem is that it is out of date and is in desperate need of updating with the latest hops, grains, extracts, yeasts, equipment techniques, and so on.In my opinion, there are no brewing books that could be considered complete, and this is as far from complete as I feel it could be."
4,A Good Starter Book,"I have been in the beer business for many years, and have read all the standard texts. This is a good book. It's direct, it's easy reading, and, unlike many of the brewing texts, it's simple to follow."
5,A Good Introductory Book,"Whatever your level of involvement in beer or brewing, you'll find something useful in The Brewers' Handbook. The information presented is certaintly exhaustive and the book covers just about every aspect of the brewing process. If I have any complaints with this book is that very little was written about beer evaluation. Nevertheless, it does a good job in discussing the technical aspects of brewing beer at a level that anybody can understand."
5,Excellent synopsis,"Excellent synopsis of modern brewery operations. Well struck balance between a simplified review and a scientific approach. This book is a great ""Step B"" for those who want to go from a beginner level understanding of brewery operations to an intermeidiate level. decent coverage in addressing how Craft brewers approach the process versus larger breweries."
4,Simple it's not...,"This book has a wealth of information in it, but it is sometimes hard to find a simple answer to common questions. For instance, today I wanted to determine the fermentability of a wort mashed at 150 degrees F instead of 155 and the subject was addressed, but didn't provide a clear definition of mash temperature vs. fermantability of wort. It did tell me, after reading almost a whole chapter that mashing at a lower temperature for a longer period of time would provide the highly fermentable wort that I wanted.Good information but not very good as a reference book."
2,Flawed . . .,"The first page I opened contained an error that would be obvious to anyone who knew their way around a brewery. As I paged through, I found a number of other mistakes and questionable statements. While the magnitude of the errors (""Indian"" Pale Ale instead of ""India"" Pale Ale, for instance) is such that most will be inconsequential for the novice or beginner, this should not be considered a reference work for anyone who wants to be taken seriously by other brewers."
5,Excellent Coverage -- Two Thumbs Up!,"This is just not another book on beer brewing. The Brewers' Handbook is the most complete book on brewing beer that I have ever read, leaving no stone unturned."
3,A good reference book,"The handbook is a good read, if a little disjoint. Its packed with useful information to help brewers understand the process of brewing and the basics.I only have a couple of issues with the book. First of all, the chapters are in a weird order. Mashing is one of the later chapters, when its one of the first things you need to know. The chapter on grain assumes you know about mashing. So the book is a bit awkward if you read the chapters in order.My second issue is the disjoint information in the chapters. Did this book go through an editing process? It seems like this is just a brain dump from a brilliant brewer. I recognize that this isn't supposed to be entertaining, but transitional phrases never killed anyone.Those points aside, I am very happy with this book, and I'm glad to have it in my collection of brewing literature."
4,Just the beginning of a Slim Man Fan!,"I heard Slim Man at a jazz festival in my city and wow. The man wears a suit like no one else. When I heard ""The Beginning"" I knew I had to buy his cd, Jazzified. The best song on the cd is The Beginning, but the others are also mello and easy to listen to. There is enough variation in the songs to keep you interested, but my favorite was that first cut and I find myself playing it over and over and over......."
4,His Lyrics Paint Pictures/His Voice Will Turn your Lover ON,"This guys lyrics are fantastic. It's been a long time since an artist was able to paint pictures as Slim Man does with his voice. A hopeless romantic in the same vain as Bobby Caldwell and Michael Franks this Man brings a new sound to the table. "" Dont say Goodbye "" will have you cryin for her not to leave. Wonderfully arranged with exceptional muscians this one is a sure thing for a great night of sweet lovin with your women or man. Slim Man does it right...................."
1,LOOKS GOOD BUT NOT DURABLE,"This lasted about three years of only summer use. The motor burned out. This fan does look nice. It is hefty, but is not exactly a well made quality product. I had problems with the fan blade-it kept falling off. The blade is secured to the motor rod by small screw. Once or twice a season the blade would fall off. I had to remove the grill to reattach. Nothing too major, but I'd always wonder why this problem wasn't engineered out. I also believe this problem caused the motor to burn out. I think the blade fell off and lodged against the grill and stopped the motor rod from spinning.That being said, the fan looks good. I took the motor out and plan to replace the motor if i can find one that fits."
4,hight quality but no pad,"It's a fine strap but it hasn't no shoulder pad, I don't remember reading that before I purchased it, maybe I missed it. You'll have to buy it separately, I had one pad from a old broken planet waves strap so I didn't have a problem after all. But this is still a fine item."
3,not worth the price,"It may have been suitable for my purpose but I expected thicker, better quality rubber for the amount I paid for it."
5,too bad they really don't have this in stock,"Despite what their website says, CD Buyers Club really doesn't have this item in stock and they do not intend to sell it anymore. Even a month after charging my account, then crediting it back to apologize, they continue to falsely list this item for sale on their website. Too bad."
2,"as anticipated, rather than as hoped","I bought this for one cut, hoping for a convergence of greatness: the great Dizzy playing a great song: Marvin Gaye's ""Flyin' High in the Friendly Sky."" (From MG's ""What's Going On?"" album.) But my high hopes were frustrated by... just what I anticipated, when being realistic: That it would prove to be an 80's pop-soul jazz affair, with Mr. Gillespie phoning it in. As it did. With synthesizers."
2,The Pregnancy Cookbook,"This book has some good recipes. However, my husband and I tried making their ""Mexican Black Bean Lasagna."" The directions were confusing (did it require two or three pots to be on the stovetop?) It took over two hours to prepare, not including baking, and we burned a garlic bulb by following their directions to microwave it for 15 minutes. Also, the details about vitamins and organizing your kitchen are better illustrated in _Eating Expectantly: A Practical and Tasty Guide to Prenatal Nutrition_ by Bridget Swinney, Tracey Anderson."
2,Not practical for working moms/dads.,"Great sounding recipes if you have the time (or someone else fixing them for you). Didn't find them practical enough for everyday use. Certainly not the kind of recipes my 3 year-old would find appealing. When I fix meals, I want something easy the whole family will enjoy."
3,I'm not impressed,"This cookbook has some good general nutritional information, and there are a few easy recipes. But, the majority of the recipes call for ingredients that are hard to find. Besides, there are too many steps and no pictures of any of the meals. I would starve by the time I got finished cooking one of the recipes!"
3,Nice idea if your husband is a good cook,"I don't know how others felt during their pregnancy, but I had no desire to cook meals. I knew I had to eat well, but the recipes in this book took too long. Also, for someone like me who felt sick to my stomach for most of my pregnancy, many of the recipes (fish, etc.) did not sound appetizing."
4,Great for all phases of your life!,I purchased this book in December of 2005 and am still religiously using it at least once a week. I do agree with another woman that left the comment that the recipes take much longer to make than the estimated times given in the book and that the recipes make much more than the recommended serving size. All in all though this is by far my favorite cook book - I know that we are eating healthy and that we are eating a variety of food groups. I also like expanding my cooking knowledge and using the ingredients that are uncommon!
3,"Great food, but who has time?","Lovely and interesting recipies, several of which I've successfully tried. But a rather ridiculous premise to think that the average expecting couple would have the time and energy to prepare most of these labor-intensive dishes unless, like the author, the woman is married to a gourmet chef."
2,Be sure to read the warnings,"This book is schizophrenic! She (the doctor) wrote the first half, a solid nutritional guide for pregnant women. He (the cook) wrote the recipes -- many of which include wine and goat cheese, items she tells you to avoid! Page 51 warns against feta and goat cheese -- so why do they appear in the recipes at all? And page 52 tells you to be sure to simmer red wine before cooking with it, to remove alcohol, but that warning doesn't show up in the recipes themselves. There are tasty recipes in here that are simple to make, including some good vegetarian ones (spinach fettucine with wild mushroom sauce; penne with swiss chard and pine nuts). But I hope no pregnant women skip the dietary warnings in the beginning, or rely on this book as their sole source of information."
4,What Has Happened to Presents,"I loved this book. It is the perfect I have 2 hours and nothing to do and need a pick me up type of thing. Basiclly this is your typical HQ Presents alpha + Virgin = Baby book, but with a certain amount of humor and a lack of some of the typical trappings that it was just great.First off the hero actually allows the heroine to interact with a man who she has a crush on, adn while he makes it clear he's not happy about it, he doesn't start issuing royal decreas or treat the heroine like she is his property. Meanwhile the heroine is a total ditz that you can't help but like her.I wish that the authors today (Lyne Graham included) were able to infuse some humor into their stories, it seems like the books we get now are A + B = C with no extra little sparks included."
5,"A fish, a dog and a man","Great story, lots of laugh, heroine to root for, hero to covet.The best of L. Graham's books. Lighthearted and fun. The scene with the personal trainer is a hoot."
5,Essential for the Serious Painter,"An astoundingly philosophical book concerning painting. Richter's entries reveal a depth to his practice seldom articulated so profoundly by a visual artist. I think this book is an essential read to people seriously engaged in the practice of painting. Not a light read, but extremely thought provoking and engaging."
1,The glass feeder broke before first use!,"I am very dissapointed. The glass feeder broke when I was attaching it to the plastic base, after pouring the liquid. The neck of the glass bottle broke and it wasn't because of a tight turn, since never finishing turning it. It might have been a defective issue. Since I don't want to pay for returning fees, I just lost my money with this item!"
3,Base doesn't scew in very well,I have this feeder and I don't know if mine just has a defect but it is very difficult to get the base aligned correctly. Other then that it's a pretty decent feeder.
4,Good value,"good durable puzzle for most children. Bought it for a 3 yr. old and he needed a lot of help with it, but he keep wanting to do it again, so he was very interested in trying to learn, but might be more appreciated at the 4 or 5 yr. level.."
5,Giant Tractor Puzzle,"My nephew really loved this puzzle. He is 15 months old and needed help but his little hands were able to manipulate the pieced due to the large size. He has put it together about 4 times now and absolutely loves it. Grandma, Mom and Auntie all have fun helping him with this puzzle. The size if great and it is easy for little ones to handle the pieces due to the size. The color are bright and rich and the art work is fabulous."
5,great puzzle,Bought this puzzle for the little boy that I babysat because he loves the John Deere tractors. Loves the puzzle and puts it together all the time. Great fun.
5,A wonderful Medtner recording,"An underestimated and neglected composer throughout the history, Nikolai Medtner deserves the appreciation fully for these piano concerti that were composed with absolute romanticism and virtuosity. First concerto is truly one of its kind in that manner, passionate and thrilling. Second movement marked ""Tranquillo, meditamente"" has a deeply touching introduction that even anyone who is not into this music could get moved easily. Scherbakov is also a great pianist and plays this piece with great virtuosity. The other piece, Third concerto is again a monumental one, but with less popularity and tempo shifts. If you are searching for Medtner's music, this CD is a great choice. Do not hesitate to take a deep look at it."
4,"Lasted 2-3 years, then conked out","This flash drive has been useful. I've used it an average of maybe 3 times a week.Initially, because of how it swivels around, it always felt like it was too loose, and I was nervous about copying anything. But it retained it's intended functionality, until last week, when it stopped working. The USB swivel thingee finally broke.I'm not sure what the shelf life of the 12Gb Maxfile is supposed to be, but generally I've been happy with it. You wouldn't want to purchase it now (in 2011), because there are smaller & cheaper units with better capacity. But if you happen to have one or a friend gives it to you, just remember to make a second back up of anything important."
3,"The Uncreative ""Creative Drama in the Classroom""","There have to be much more creative, interesting books on Creative Drama in the Classroom. I don't know why they keep revising this book."
2,careful ... color comes off,I really want to love this album ... after all it is very cute and made of soft plush .... HOWEVER ... one day I found my daughter (then 8 months old) with a red mouth after having chewed on the album .... apparently the color (from the album page rims) comes of after prolonged soaking. So be careful when giving it to a baby that puts everything in his/her mouth.
2,Not quite what I expected,I thought that because this photo album was designed for babies/toddlers that it would be hard to get the pictures out (I am sure there is a some design that they could come up with). My daughter who is 16 months old just takes the pictures right out which defeats the whole purpose of having them safe in the album. I wasn't impressed.
2,Not Satisfied with my first GPS,"This is my first GPS and I bought it for curiousity since my wife is the best GPS for me. Out of the box, it is perfect look. That evening we went out for dinner and then go to Target using the GPS for nevigation. It is not bad at all, but gave me different route that I used to drive on. The next day, we drove from NJ to Long Island via Lindon Tunnel and Midtown Tunnel. The GPS was generating a route since I left my home. All the way through NJ Turnpike until I got on Queens, NY, the GPS finally got my route and take us to my destination in a local street. For the whole two hours, we turned it back on twice and happened the same. I returned it and I think I will never buy a GPS again."
2,Not Impressed,"I have had this unit for about 9 months.It is relatively easy to see and the interface works well.It generally gives pretty good directions, but (and this is huge) in October of 2007 we needed to get to Indianapolis airport from the Cincinnati area. We were guided through a series of dead end roads. Almost missed our plane. It turned out well for us, but this could be a huge issue for others.The battery life is horrible and takes forever to charge. If you do not have a constant powered outlet in your vehicle this will not stay charged.You cannot use the picture viewer through the SD card and have maps at the same time as they are not stored internally, but on the SD card.The unit takes forever to find satellites. It often takes 10 minutes or more.It causes interference with AM radio and as an avid AM listener this is a big problem.Overall I have not been impressed and am very close to returning to Garmin and considering this a lost cause."
1,Poor Design,"It takes very long for the product to connect to the satellites. So, you have to wait sometimes 8 minutes before it starts navigating. I returned it in one week of use."
1,"Never Found a Satellite - Defective, as was Tech Support","Mine did not work ever. Ten calls to tech support, got through once and he hung up on me when I said that my machine ( a christmas gift) could not find a single satellite and I did not want to move to Tulsa.Waste of money for this one. They want a credit card number to even think about taking a look at it.AVOID THIS CHEAP PRODUCT"
4,Great GPS especially for the price.,"This GPS has worked well for me. I like the 3D mapping better than others I have seen. It has all the features that I need. You can find any point of interest you are looking for. The user interface was easy for me to figure out, I didn't have to read any instructions. I would recommend this product to anyone looking to buy a GPS for there vehicle."
4,Good buy for the price.,"I bought it to help me find my way when I'm lost and so far it has been fine for just that. The maps and colors are vivid and easy to read and it's loaded with plenty of points of interest. I would have given it 5 of 5, but it takes a little long to locate a satellite when you first turn it on."
4,Lowrance iway250c,"For the price it does a great job. There's not a lot of poi that I look for , but if you put in an address it gets you there. I used it from NY to SC and around Columbia and it has done a really good job. If I had $800 to spend then that would be a different opinion. Best bang for the buck."
1,never got a signal,this company should stick to fish finding! I live in mountains of pa and it never picked up a sattelite returned it and bought a tom tom go 300 and it picked up 7 sattelites out the box..same price though refurbed
2,Navigation System,The product arrive when specified but I was disatisfied with the discription that was given on the product. There was not much information on the way the product worked neither was there more than one picture so that I could see it from diferent angles. The product is mediocre at best since it is very difficult not only to program but to locate the address. Also I am not very satisfied as to how accurate it is at getting you to your location. This GPS is better suited for someone who already knows the area fairly well but would most likely loose or misdirect someone who is not familiar with there surroundings.
2,It gets lost.,"I recently purchased the iWay 250C and attempted to plot a trip to my son's home in Jacksonville, NC. Even thought his street and address have been in effect longer than 5 years, the iWay said it did not exist. I had to call him to get his personal latitude and longitude to locate him. The unit did not direct me to his home but got close to the turn to his street.It also got lost and gave us incorrect turn directions to and returning on the trip. My wife became confused due to the vocal direction instructions causing us some delay to reset the unit.It also requires a stylus instead of finger touch-point for accuracy on the screen.When reporting the address discrepancies, I did not receive any response from Lowrance.I was looking forward to my first experience with an auto GPS but was very disappointed with its lack of database and directions. Therefore, the item has been returned. I am awaiting to see how well refunds and gift certificates are handled."
2,Very bad gps,"Must to wait for a long time for pre-position, very slowly calculation and re-calculation, etc.. I returned this item through couple days and buy new one Garmin Nuvi 350 - this is great item, I really like it, probably best one on the market."
4,Not bad for the money,"I was going to return this GPS, because it got us lost twice on our trip. If you pretty much know where you are going, then this is a good gps. I wouldn't blindly rely on it though. It did give us bad directions a few times, but I already had mapquest directions, so I knew not to use the route it was giving me. If I were going to purchase another one, I would buy a more expensive model by another company."
4,Good device but slow to initially locate,"I've been using the 250c for about 2 months now and overall I'm happy with it. Generally it gives directions that will get you where you are going, but sometimes it is not the most direct route (for routes I know).The only real problem I've had is how long it sometimes takes to locate the satelite and find its initial position. Once it locks on, it stays on pretty well and if you lose it briefly(go through a tunnel) it will re-locate itself pretty quickly.At less than $200 it is quite the deal for a basic GPS."
1,Avoid the Lowrance GPS units,"The first one we got didn't have all the necessary software installed, so we decided to give it another chance and exchanged it.This is NOT a pull-out-of-the-box-and-use product. It's NOT user friendly at all. And even after reading the entire manual and supposedly setting up the GPS, it STILL didn't work correctly.Do yourself a favor and spend the extra money to get one of the more well-known GPS units like Garmin or TomTom."
5,Hop On Board For A Fun Movie With Your Kids,Quality DVD and all children enjoy the Wiggles and their zany escapades. The kids will love following the Wiggles as they hop in the big red car and go on exciting adventures. Don't be surprised if the adults in your house start finding themselves singing the fun songs from the movie. Price was very reasonable and item was shipped quickly. The items were packaged very well and arrived in great condition.
2,"Ahhh,the singer","This is in fact 5 star album but the singer ruined it.He makes all the songs like same song.When he starts to sing I am like covering my ears.It is hard to understand if he is singing,reading or telling a story.A review says if singing is important to you, then don't listen thrash.Okay then tell every singer in the thrash bands not to sing anymore or let this singer sing for all heavy metal bands.Hey Dave and James pls stop singing and look for a job.Too bad,the other band members became the victim of Sean Killian.Some people say Neil Turbin of Anthrax is a bad singer.Listen this cd and make your decision.On the other hand I still recommend this album for its great guitars and drums."
5,Attention TEACHERS + LIBRARIANS a terrific Net introduction!,"This is a great way to get into using the Net. I passed it along to the Librarian and Teachers at my kids' school. They said it was a fabulous resource for developing net-based curricula. Sites are grouped by subject in easy-to-use articles and the articles are grouped by general category. Pick a topic, hit the index and GO! You'll have a great trip."
5,Wow...Amazing... I've only been on it 5 days and what an improvement!,"I was diagnosed with a low thyroid problem a year ago and they've put me on some medicine which at times makes my hair fall out and when it isnt falling out, the medicine drys the hair out. I have always had thick,full beautiful hair and was so sad to watch it all go away because of the medicine. Then I found this product on Amazon. Another reviewer (who also has a low thyroid problem) indicated that this helped her....so I decided to give it a try. WOW.... I CANT BELIEVE IT. Moisture is back in my hair...my hair is soft..the hairs are getting ""thicker"" and my hair isnt falling out. I'm going to buy a ton of this stuff. I cant believe that after 5 days on this product, my hair is back to its old self... I'm a very happy customer and I highly recommend this product."
3,Vitamins for Hair Loss,"I gave this product a three star rating. (at this time)I have not used the product long enough to see significant results. After being sick in 2007 and losing some of my hair as a result of the illness, I was told about these vitamins by a professional at a salon. He informed me that one of his clients had used these vitamins - after her illness - and she was very pleased with regrowth of her hair as well as new hair growth. I will buy them again as I want to give the product at least six months to see if there are adequate results."
3,Missing track?,"I really enjoy this album- as well as any other that Hammock has made. Simply some of my favorite music ever.But- is there a track missing from this album?The track listing I found was this:1. Moon Through the Branches2. Empty Page/Blue Sky3. Dropping Off4. Just Before Breathing5. Still Point6. No Stopping the SeaSo...where is track two?So, for now I'll give it three stars with a missing track. Otherwise-- it would be five stars."
4,none,I brougt this game on 9/30/11. it only take a week for me to get it in the mail. when i got it i intall the cd-rom game the next day. and that's when i saw that i wasn't going to be to crazy about some of the games that are on the cd-rom .
2,Castellana Crostini Italian Crackers :-(,"Quite disappointed in the product - not like other crostini crackers I have had in the past. They were almost (not quite) burnt, but very close. I will not order this brand again. And now I am stuck with 11 packages. Oh well another of life's lessons learned."
2,A Big Disappointment,"Granted, I received this unit as a hand-me-down from a friend, and didn't spend any money on it, but I am still not all too happy with it. My main complaint is that the unit does not have enough manual controls on the unit itself to allow you to operate the DVD function without the use of a remote control. This is something that every DVD player should be able to do. Second of all, the remote control has stopped working, and after buying TWO universal remotes to try and operate it, the unit still will not respond. Piece of junk--don't buy it."
4,Interesting,"My big gripe no pictures in a biography, especially wanted to see their pictures from children to adults. Well written book.."
3,Average at best,"If you know nothing about Quenn Victoria or her children this book might be a worthwhile read. The writing style is nice but it contains infromation that can easily be obtained from other sources. Having read several books on Queen Victoria, I would only rate this book as average."
5,Great book!,Very detailed and concise on Victoria's children and historical basis of their lives. I found this text the most complete on her life and that of her kids.
1,Terrible,"In an age where music is becoming more experimental (a good thing), and bands are pushing the envelopes of what a musical composition can be, we are presented with the Fiery Furnaces. This is one the most highly revered and acclaimed albums of the year, and it is also one of the worst pieces of rubbish ever commited to record. I can't believe actual studio time was wasted on this. I've listened to this album 12 TIMES, trying to understand it, or give it some credit, but the only thing that came to mind was how I'd rather listen to a tone-deaf baby play an out-of-tune banjo over a distorted bullhorn. It's one thing to be sonically creative, but to make music-less music, c'mon. How absurd are the hipsters of America that they find this inaccessible trash a masterpiece of 2005. DON'T BUY/LISTEN/OR READ ABOUT THE FIERY FURNACES... EVER."
1,tries too hard,"This album has been praised for its unique approach to pop music. However, this approach has yeilded something decidedly anti-pop and is somewhat abrasive. For all of the quirky songcraft on ""Blueberry Boat,"" it manages to become boring and tedious as songs bloat and ramble. Some may disagree with this citing the ever changing directions within the songs as being an exciting trait. I feel these changes are tedious due to their reuse throughout the song or album (also, these sections aren't even catchy or interesting). The schizophrenic nature of the songs is more isolating than it is brilliant. I bought this album due to a positive pitchfork review and have regetted it ever since. Save yourself my misfourtune."
4,Dazzling....,"What a great album. I friend of mine had to literally beg me to listen to this but I am glad I did. Sure the songs are long and might ramble a bit but they always keep your attention. Each song has some kind of catchy hook that makes it stick in your head even after the album is over. Easily the best album I have heard yet in 2005 even though it was released in 2004. If your a music cynic like I am give this a listen, I think you will be pleasantly surprised."
2,Should be catagorized in the Musical section!!!,"I too was caught up in the hype of this album. Many reviews, especially pitchfork, gave it a raving review. The album is indeed ambitious and that's about all I'll give it. If you are looking for something similar to the soundtrack for RENT, this might be worth looking into as it flows like a musical. No real hooks or continuity at all. Her voice is also not a rock voice, but much more suited for a stage musical. One review likened this to the Who's ""A Quick One..."". The big difference is that the Who's opera pieces rock, this does NOT."
2,This sucks right? I'm pretty sure it sucks...,"I'll just state right off that I listen to a very wide variety of music (much of which you could call challenging or ""avante""). I even periodically read that bastion of musical hipster elitism Pitchfork and occasionally even agree with their reviews. But, this I just don't get. I've listened to this album about 10 times now and I've come to the conclusion that it's hyper-repetitive, low on ideas, and even lower on melodic invention. For those wondering what this album is about, just listen to one 30 second sample, then multiply that by 100; that's the album. Gallowsbird and the new e.p. are much less irritating."
1,What a Crapfest!,"This is really terrible, terrible music. Absolutely no sense of self-control or taste was displayed in the making of this long, long, long album. Do everything you can to avoid this overhyped garbage."
3,can't get totally into this one,"I have tried and tried to get inside Blueberry Boat and hear its brilliance. But somehow it doesn't happen for me. The songs are quirky and energetic and original on some level --- and there are some pretty big curve balls in terms of the tempo and key changes --- but I don't find it totally compelling somehow. Still, the band is obviously very talented and I will continue to follow them and get the next album."
5,Words cannot express,"Where to begin? To put it as briefly as possible, if you're an adventurous music listener you will not be disappointed by Blueberry Boat. This is the most inventive work I've heard since Radiohead's Kid A. (No small feat). Every style you could imagine is carefully melded into one, including the most wonderfully bizzare lyrics I have ever heard. No sense discussing every track ad nauseam, each individual will form their own opinions. I can only give this my highest and most urgent recommendation.Pay no mind to the impatient simps who give this album one star and call it ""the worst of all time."" Sit down with Blueberry Boat; listen to it as many times as you have to. Those who *get* this musical gift from the Friedbergers will fall in love. Give it a chance and you may be pleasantly surprised."
1,this CD sucks,This CD is really horrible. The sound is discordant and repetitive. Take a hammer and start banging on your refrigerator door....
2,Blasphemy!!!,"Comparing this mediocre CD to anything The Who ever recorded is absolute rock and roll blasphemy. Yes, I'll give the Furnaces 2 stars for their creativity, and there are some fine moments on the CD, but they are few and far between. It should be a requirement that you have to take Ritalin before listening to this mess. I like Frank Zappa's stuff, but the big difference between Zappa and the Furnaces is that Zappa was a musician and he actually had talent. The joke behind this CD is that every time I began to enjoy something melodic or rhthymic, it would change. It's like listening to the radio for an hour, and having the DJ cut off every song, when it is halfway through. Very frustrating.Perhaps I don't understand what Matt and Eleanor are trying to do here, but then again, maybe it's better that way. I'm sure they are nice people."
1,Absolute Junk,"I saw the FIERY FURNACES open up for WILCO last year at Radio City Music Hall, NY last year. A high school talent show would have been more entertaining. Absolute noodling rubbish. The sounded like bad seventies GENESIS, heavy metal, and SUN RA all combined. Oh yeah, the sound sucked too. I understand pushing the boundaries and experimenting but, come on. A hint of melody might be a thought. The only thing going for them is the very beautiful singer."
3,Fiery Furnaces dabbles with electronics,"Don't let my heading fool you, 'Blueberry Boat' still retains all the avant-garde blues elements which made their debut appealing. Gritty, brash and refreshing. But the approach this time around is to incorporate subtle electronic sounds, basically expanding their horizons a bit, yet so background that this can actually be considered 'Gallowsbird's Bark Part 2'. Occasionally bands will dealve into turntablism/neo-psychadelia as means of placing a different spin on their traditional sound. Such is the creative spirit of art...you rarely stand still. For some bands, the result is twisted into blandness, eg, The Beta Band, Dandy Warhols, and hell, even Campag Velocet. In contrast, the Fiery Furnaces succeeds in achieving this by not drastically altering their musical formula. 'Blueberry Boat' demonstrates the pairs gift for restless experimentalism, continuing to capture the spirit of the blues, and managing to retain their humanity."
2,I am bored zzzzzzzzzz....,"Am I the only person bored by this album? I like a few tracks, like Chief Inspector, Spaniolated, and Turning Around, but like is the key word here. The album on the whole makes me feel nothing and sounds like this bro and sis meshing a bunch of instruments together to create this atmospheric and indie sounding record. I have no love for this band. Just not feeling it, but to each his own I guess. Now The Arcade Fire, that's a great band!"
5,Five stars is not overstating it....,"This is the first review I have ever been prompted to write on Amazon; the album is that good. The sound is unexpected more than difficult, pretentious, or ""ambitious."" Give it a chance. The thirty second clips really don't do justice to any of the tracks, as they don't show the really unique way the songs evolve. Nothing in the structure comes across as arbitrary or just thrown in for the sake of complexity. So don't just listen to little blurbs and decide you find them tiresome. See if you can listen to all of track 3 instead, at a store or a friend's place. If you don't like that track, you won't enjoy the album.Also, they can actually write lyrics."
2,"Lots of imagination, no feelings","Is that a graduation project for some fancy music school?I think I will give them an A for imagination and creativity, but I will give this album only 2 stars for lack of emotion. Too bad..."
1,the ugly truth,"Lordy, I can't remember the last time I heard a more pretentious and painful album. The Fiery Furnaces are here to make your life hell. Honestly, I've rarely heard an album that's so hard to listen to, in fact I gave up about 2/3 of the way through. Fortunately I borrowed it off a friend so I didn't suffer the indignity of handing over money for such a load of tripe. If you're after the musical equivalent of schizophrenia, well, congratulations, you've found it. I'm firmly convinced the hype surrounding this album is part of the most elaborate con perpetrated on music fans since The Strokes. Avoid at all costs."
2,If thats what your into,"PERSONALY i don't like FF at all they sound like something music shouldn't be. But I know that everyone has there own tastes and opinions. Yes they sound original... lets hope they do cause I would hate for more of this crap to be produced. Musically they "" ""could"" have potental so two stars for them."
3,oh..?,"Did I miss something?It's not bad, if you can, in fact get past the opening track. And I admittedly have a rather eclectic taste in music. But this, I just.. didn't get it.Seems there is a hype about this band. I don't really see why. I also don't see how they're 'revolutionizing' Indie-rock.Not a bad listen, to say the least. But afterwards, I felt deflated when I realized I bought into the critics, and left feeling like this isn't the five star record I was told it was.I did enjoy the track 'Mason City.' If that's any use to anyone at all.Also, it's come to my attention that if you don't have taste, and like Iron and Wine, you won't like this album. It's good to know that everyone is a critic. Even if they have severely flawed judgement. People like what they like, the matter of taste is purely based on the person themself."
1,Happy New Year,Congradulations to the author of this piece of arrant nonsense for demonstrating just how delusional the human mind can get when they allow religion to take over their ability to think rationally. Its damn sad.
1,Idiocy personified,"This person is an author and a prophet like I am Napoleon. But then again theists are by nature credulous and deluded ... this self-published wanna be ""writer"" exemplifies the worst of them.I imagine that the faithful can hardly wait for the sequel:""2008...This Time I'm Serious!!"""
3,Are these free yet?,"I haven't had a chance to read this yet. I was hoping, now that it's 2008, that the prices would have come down.What's keeping the price up? Is there a large collector's market for these?"
1,Dangerous,"Scary that weak minded people may believe false prophets and cancel their children's college educations and not plan for their future in general due to insane ego driven ramblings, Simply irresponsible..."
3,"pleased, but unconfirming","I also had a vision of Jesus returning, riding on a cloud, transforming His people with a wave of His hand, and returning with them to heaven. This was back in 1982. So I was very interested to read what Shelby Corbitt had to write. She quotes lots of Bible verses to prove her point, but I am unconvinced that 2007 is the year. Nevertheless, she makes the strong point that today is ""the day of salvation"" for anyone who has not yet repented of their sins and received Jesus as Savior and Lord, because none of us is guaranteed tomorrow. As for her being ""an uneducated pentecostal"", that is what the Pharisees thought of Jesus!! hmmm Since 5/15/76 I can testify that living with Jesus is The Adventure, so don't miss out on the Kingdom of Righteousness, Peace and Joy!"
5,one word-AWESOME!,An awesome cd..told you just one word can describe it's AWESOME...just like GOD...=)
5,Seven stars for Seven Day Jesus!!,"For fans of mellow music, this album just might not be your best bet. However, if you like a CD that rocks a dreary day into a peppy afternoon, GO FOR IT!!! SDJ's sophomore is one of the best rock CDs I've heard in a while. Fans of any group from DCTalk to MXPX to the Newsboys will like this album too. The first 3 songs are sure favorites. Let your church's youth pastor take a listen to the closer, You Are The One, for teen service praise & worship! All in all, this is one fine effort from Seven Day. I give this effort seven thumbs up!"
5,"Small town Christian band, delivers HUGE ALBUM!!","Seven Day Jesus' latest album,is phenomenal! As a long time Christian, i still listened mostly to secular music, but this album, got me back into Christian Music! SDJ, is most definitely the best Christian band up there with Smalltown poets. Its like the only CD in my collection, i can play straight through, and not get sick of! Every song is awesome! ""Down with the Ship"", and ""I will find you"" are my favorites! Possibly the best album i've ever heard! You MUST buy it. it should be triple platinum."
3,Rock For The Masses,"Most music is written to please a certain taste: punk music is perfect for teenage boys, boy bands make 12-year old girls swoon, and rap is great if you dig that scene--but Seven Day Jesus writes pop rock that most people can enjoy. Recommended, but don't make it the first album on your list."
1,About what I expected,I waited quite some time to purchase this cd. I should have left it where I bought it.
3,The fisrt three songs are the best.,This is a good CD if you like a mix of soft and medium rock. The first three songs are the best. My favorite is Down With the Ship.
5,Gourmet on a budget,"This assortment of olives in light oil with rosemary, red peppers, and light spices is delicious and long-lasting. Great for doing a large buffet, appetizer plate, holiday meal, or to keep in the fridge during times when company may stop in. Just pour into a bowl and serve - festive and great for snacking. Very yummy!"
4,Great tasting olives,"Very nice selection and taste of olives, garlic, red peppers, capers, etc. Could use less herbs."
4,Not bad - But wish there was more brine,"At times I crave olives. I'm not an olive aficionado, but I did enjoy these. I'm not sure how good a deal this is (though compared to olive bars it would seem simple math).I liked the olives at the bottom of the bag better than the ones on the top. More spices and brine. I sampled them as I moved them to jars. :) There's very little brine in each jar, so I'm not sure what to do about that or how to make a proper brine, though I'm sure I could google it. Someone stated that they topped the jars off with water or olive oil. But it would be filling the jars in my case.Any advice is welcome. Thanks"
5,Delightful Product,"These are high quality olives. The variety and spices are excellent. I have purchased these on three separate occasions since I discovered them here. The shipping was pretty timely, as well."
3,Beer Belly,"Ab Lounge XLI just received this item and put it together. The one thing they don't tell you in the instruction book; Make sure you tighten up ALL the bolts. There are 6 bolts on the bar that holds the tension bands. 4 of them are 9/16, the other 2 are 11/16. Make sure that they are tightened, but loose enough to still allow movement. The piece that I received had all 6 of those bolts loose enough to cause damage to the equipment if not tightened properly."
1,Need instructions on how to put together?,"Product came very quickly, but when I received it, it contained no instructions, and no dvd. Does anyone know how to put this thing together? I'll provide another review once I start using it."
2,Ab Lounge XL (missing a lot),"The Ab Lounge XL I recieved in the mail was missing a back frame piece, and replaced by a wrong piece. So putting it together, it ended up being crooked without the proper piece. Maybe that is why it had discounted price. The ad said was perfectly new.. but did not look that way. It was a gift, so I was afraid to ask to take it back. I would not recommend this persons future sales. What a hassle!! The only thing right was that it arrived in the time estimated. Who wants the hassle of shipping this bulky thing back?"
4,great if I used it more,"Really do feel the product working in just a few minutes; however I don't use it enough to see any results, but I still like it."
2,complicated assembly,The price is great for this item. However there were a couple issues. One is that there were very limited instructions for assembly. The other is that wherever it was stored gave it a smell that still has not gone away.
4,a good investment,i have had trouble for years with ab excercises because my neck is easily irritated. the ab lounge allows me to pay some attention to my core strength while supporting my head and neck in a way that seems to work. if i had it to buy again...i would. the shipping was timely and it was very well packaged to protect the contents.
2,Save your money,"My wife talked me into buying this. It is a sturdy piece of equipment. It may be a good alternative for individuals who can't do traditional ab exercises due to back problems, deconditioning, etc. As a person who trains with free weights 2-3 times a week I never got a burn with this piece of equipment. Personally it hurt my back as I extended beyond horizontal. I used it 5-10 ten times and now it sits in the garage. I would suggest buying a good ab workout tape/dvd if you need exercise ideas and/or motivation. I think you will get a better workout and save a chunk of money at the same time."
4,Ab Loung XL Review,"I found the AbLounge XL relatively simple to put together. I am someone who abhors the words ""some assembly required"" but the instructions were simple to follow. You really need to have a space where this can be utilized. Not good for cramped spaces or close quarters. I would keep pets and children away from this while it is in use. The dangers to small fingers and pet paws are obvious and there are numerous warnings and stickers posted to remind the adult user. I am a short person and the adjustable foot bar is easily adjusted to accomodate a taller user. It is a fun way to work out and I saw results in 10 days."
5,Great,This Ab Lounge XL is a great for working out your abs. It works great and easy to store and build to work out on it.
1,DVD'S Didn't play - Don't purchase from Amazon!,Almost half the DVD's froze up or didn't play at all! When I tried to return them even thought I was within the return back time period they would not refund me the money. Do not order from Amazon!kk
1,Didn't Receive,I never received my purchase from Dorothy Meyerson. I believe this person and her products are a hoax!!! Do not trust. No reply from her either when I contacted her.
5,The price has dropped. Great Buy.,"The price has dropped on this item and since I've just done the math, it is ten dollars cheaper than buying the seasons separately. As I don't need subtitles, they didn't matter to me, so I give this item a 5 star thumbs up, seeing as its the same exact quality of the individual seasons, but cheaper."
4,Hooked on Crime,Found the series just recently by accident and now I am hooked. Far out storylines and interesting characters. DVD's were purchased to catch up on past seasons. Love the show. Have a New Year's Marathon...!
1,subtitles???,"I LOVE Criminal Minds but I'm so disapointed all this DVD collection is coming out without any subtitles options, why is that??!!!?????English is not my 1rst language and I really enjoy having the option to put English (or Spanish, or French) subtitles on to be able to understand everything and then watch it again without.Also I don't live in a English-speaking country so subtitles are a must if I want to introduce my favorite TV series to my friends who don't know them. But without any subtitles most people won't even bother to try to watch it.That's the only reason I'm not buying this item! What a shame."
1,Don't buy if you NEED subtitles as advertised,"Criminal Minds is my favorite all time tv show, truly a five star show! Season 6 has subtitles, and I hope 7 will, but this set of 1-5 that clearly claims subtitles in the specs, does NOT.Because I'm hard of hearing, I catch about half the dialogue, especially when Dr. Reid is talking. Considering the price, false advertising is unacceptable"
1,Rip-Off,"As others have mentioned, buy separately. Individual Seasons cheaper than Box set. So unless you have the overwhelming desire to pay nearly $50 extra for the pretty little package deal, then.....BUY SEPARATE!Amazon..Your Sales Manager needs a remedial Math course!"
2,surprisingly poor packaging from Amazon,"I love criminal minds and was thrilled when I saw the great deal Amazon offered for the 5 seasons together. I order a lot from Amazon and always appreciate how it is all sent promptly and packaged well. Which is why I was so surprised when I received this order. It was in a box 2-3 times too big and inside it were the seasons plastic wrapped together with no padding or cardboard supporting it. There was also no ""filler"" in the box. So the seasons were just bouncing around freely in the box. Now many of the season boxes have dented and roughed up corners and a few of the plastic cases are broken. DVD's are fine so I didn't make a big deal about it, just a little disappointed for something coming from Amazon who is usually good about these things"
3,Missing disc...,"Season 2 came with 2 discs 3&4 and no disc 1&2. Quality not the best, but okay. Other discs, that were watched appear to be alright."
5,OH MY GOODNESS~!!!,"You want a Sturdy, beautiful, economical Coffee table that goes ANYWHERE in your room? I got it~! I've searched and searched and searched for such coffee tables for 3 month going to furniture stores to stores, searched on eBay for days, and now I found this table. This is the best thing I have ever found ~!!!! PERFECT. I just love it so much for my multi million dollar home. You do not have to have a multi million dollar home to own this table. Even YOU can own this beautiful total functional table if you have the class and taste in quality, and esign~!!! Don't you think you deserve it?? Well,.....here is your chance~! I said it~!!!! Great Table for ALL."
5,Awesome toy,I am greatful for this toy because I am collecting them to have my dinosaours again and thanks for make it possible but amazon please sell all the toys and product because sometimes it is not easy to get this products in Mexico. Thanks Amazon
4,My son loves it but......,"This is a great dino - just the right size, very realistic, the mouth opens and closes. However, right out of the box my son made it ""eat"" his T-Rex and the mouth is now open forever. Not gaping, but it doesn't close all the way anymore. What are you going to do? It's a toy and kids are tough on toys. It's still a favorite toy and gets played with every day. I would recommend it to kids who want a really good Spinosaurus Egypticus."
3,Spindly spinosaurus,"While this toy has an articulated mouth which makes it cool, the arms are too weak - my 5 year old daughter snapped one off just trying to position it. For the amount it costs it should be more durable."
4,jurassic park 3-ish,"this is a very realistic toy dino. it has an awesome paint job and detailing so good, that even the roof of the mouth is painted so that it looks moist. i would recommend this toy to anyone who likes dinosaurs. it is not just for playing with, but it can also be put on display."
3,papo spinosaurus,This is a verry fun toy but it has almost no posability.His mouth can open but that is it .Now that the bad is out of the way i can get on with the good.The detale on this figure is wonderful.the detale on his mouth and scales is great i just wish it had more posability
2,Kept falling over,"Very realistic, I loved all the detail work and the fact that you could open and close his mouth.I had to return mine because it wouldn't stand up. It just kept falling over.I purchased the schelich dinosaur instead of trying for a new papo and I have had no problems with it.The papo is really nice but, they need to work on balancing it out right.No kid wants a fall-down- asaurs"
1,Useless product. Do not buy,"In theory, a cheese slicer should be used to slice cheese. This product cannot accomplish that task. It was able to make exactly 1.333 slices of cheese before the poorly manufactured item self destructed in my hand."
2,Who wants to read a textbook?,"I'm really sorry to pan a book in a series I have come to like, but, as a lawyer who has to read altogether too many dry, hypertechnical documents a day, this was a real failure. I feel that the genre is ACTION first and foremost, and the complexity of this series is just simply getting in the way of the action. I am quite capable of achieving suspension of disbelief, and I don't need a textbook on the pseudophysics of time/dimensional travel to do so. Probably 80 pages of this work could have been directed to actions and adventure rather than trying to achieve an unneeded ""scientific"" basis for the way the characters get where they are going. I know Einstein says no going beyond light speed - maybe he is right but I still want to see Star Wars and won't care a bit about Einstein. Axler - its OK, we got to the new dimension - lets DO something there!!!!!"
2,read the decription carefully ...,"The sign is exactly as described, although I question that it would last 3-4 years outside. It is not the standard size metal animal crossing sign. It's made of cardboard & plastic, much smaller than the sign I thought it was. Caveat emptor."
5,One of the Best Books I&#65533;ve Ever Read,"I'm one of those people who reads a book with a yellow marker to highlight key parts. By the time I was done reading this book, I had highlighted probably a hundred sentences! In addition to the mystery, sometimes outrageous humor, and down to earth sincerity, this book if filled with wonderful pieces of wisdom to live by that by itself could fill a small book. I think some other reviewers are over emphasizing the, shall we say, adult parts of the book. I found the core element of the story to be a profound statement to all of us who find life a struggle from time to time."
3,Reader from Florida,"This book will certainly be helpful to many people and was somewhat helpful to me. I was prepared to look past the obvious borrowing of concepts from Castaneda's books (which Regan clearly rips off). What I was unprepared for were the numerous typos and misprints. The book leaves the impression that Regan got a great idea to borrow just enough of Castaneda's work to make a self-help book, wrote it in a weekend, and rushed it into print. Where was the editing? Leo is a poor substitute for Don Juan (and I don't mean the ladies man)."
3,It was a decent read,"I like to read books that focus on ""being a warrior"" such as the Casteneda books, and Peaceful Warrior books. It really helps put things into perspective and helps me to refocus. This book is no exception to the genre, but I gave it three stars due to it having too many loose ends that never get resolved, and an overall feel of meandering. This book did feel like a rehash of other books mentioned above, with a little less clarity/understanding of the concepts central to this genre. I did find the book engaging and I found myself wanting to read it despite these factors, and may even buy the authors second book as I did find some enjoyment in reading the book. Overall, it was a good book that I don't regret getting, but I would read through the Peaceful Warrior series, and some of the Casteneda books before branching into this particular book/author."
2,Weird carnival music,"The first track sounds like something from a stupid carnival or circus. This cd has some good parts though. The first track isn't even scary. If you want to listen to something really scary, check out the score to ""Sleepy Hollow""."
4,Jerry Goldsmith vs Danny Elfman,"Well, I used to think Danny Elfman was the most creepy composer I have ever heard, but in this Score Goldsmith is unrecognizable and better than Elfman (in this case for the moment and only in ""creepy subjects"")I found myself looking over my shoulder a couple of times in plain midday while Curly Hair track was playing.Good Score I should say (the film... normal, nothing special but entertaining)"
3,"good, but not Goldsmith's best","The music is good and goes well with the movie, which was unfortunately not as good as people expected it to be, but overall, good."
3,"Pretty Good, But Lacks More.","I am a big fan of Jerry Goldsmith's music because it always thrills me as in ""The Edge,"" and more recently, ""The 13th Warrior."" But when I viewed ""The Haunting"" (a poor film with a bad script), I at least expected Goldsmith to turn in his usual broad stroak of sound and feeling. But I was disappointed to find out that his music for ""The Haunting,"" though well-composed and with good sound, is almost as boring as the movie. But can you really blame Goldsmith? Is it his fault that the movie doesn't give him a lush canvas to paint on as in ""L.A. Confidential"" and ""The Edge?"" In the end, it's well-composed, but not good enough, or even exciting."
2,very boring... only a few arousing parts,this soundtrack was overall ..... boring. i cant stand the tracks like #6..... my favorite waz the last track.... it waz so dramatic... a few other tracks carry the main tune of the last track... but only for a few seconds. #5 has about...... 8 seconds of a good part. the fast music is very noisy and irritating.... i am not too happy that i wasted that money on an irritating soundtrack. i am trying to sell it.
3,"Oh, no. This score is unfortunatly a disapointment.","This is Jerry Goldsmith when he is not at his peak. A few good moments only. It is missing the usual Goldsmith touch. It is also missing the aw inspiring beautiful track that is usually on all of Goldsmith's scores. The film was good and I liked it a lot, the score went great with the film but alone it is not as impressive. For serious Goldsmith fans only."
4,Thrilling,"First of all, excuse my bad English! I'm sorry for the mistakes. ""The Carousel"" is a fantastic horror-theme. The Piece sounds funny, but it's really strange. But Track 8, ""Finally Home"", is one of the best Pieces in Goldsmith's career. He used so much classic-style like synkopis (my grammar is also horror...:-)), fantastic modulations and, of course, the synthesizer. This one fly lightly over a heavy rythm and saves the piece from sounding cheap. The change of rythm and tonality before the final climax is so thrilling, that I get goose flesh everytime I hear it. This Piece is DEFINITELY not normal for Goldsmith. It's much more important and better like ""Planet of the Apes"". The Rest of ""The Haunting"" is sometimes lyrical, sometimes romantic. Buy it!"
2,Pass.,"Goldsmith at his most bored. Should have passed on this idiotic film. It does receive the score it deserves: smooth, glossy descriptive music for a big empty over-produced haunted house movie. Score seems to derive it's materials from a bland carousel theme but the structure barely registers, just presents a few minor mode string effects that flirt with becoming a melody, then some predictable set-piece cues that are more asleep than frightening (think CASPER 2). Score is a long way from Goldsmith's classic impressionism and modernity found in THE MEPHISTO WALTZ and POLTERGEIST. All the cool ideas and jagged edges have been worn smooth and Horner-like by 90s commercial constraints. Not recommended. For 100-proof Goldsmith hold out for his best score in a long time, THE 13TH WARRIOR."
4,cuban music,"Even though most songs are not sung by the original artists, the music flavor comes through..What matters is the nostalgia to listen to and say ""I remember this song"" and sing along..."
1,Do Not Buy,I bought this CD for my grandmother this Holiday season as a gift.... the music on the disc were muffled and basically unlistenable. Do not buy this CD unless you want a huge disappointment or a paper weight.
1,Not so much...,"I adore red velvet cake and these were terrible.The box arrived intact, yet when opened, about 1/2 of the petit fours were damaged looking. They were very dry and tasted nothing like what I expected. Too bad.. I was really looking forward to them."
3,Just OK...,"Well, These Petits taste good, but there a few things that leave a bitter aftertast in your mouth. Lets talk about size, these are just a little bit bigger then those tiny candy bar samples your kids get for halloween, no, not the fun size, the ones half that size, there tiny, and keep in mind that you will end up paying almost 30.00(with shipping) for 20 of these, that about 1.50 per cake. They would have got a better rating if it wasn't for the price thats for sure. Another thing is these little things are extremely sweet, which I enjoyed, but some people I shared with didn't, so thats more of a prefferenace I guess. In all, i wouldn't buy these again, only because of the price, its simple not worth it."
2,Side Tables,Decided tables were unacceptable to meet my need. (Partical board laminate with a awful extreme HIGH gloss finish) Also found it very disturbing that the company charges a 20% restocking fee plus shipping at my expense to return the items. Learned a costly mistake of ordering something on the internet you can't see. Won't do that again.I ended up giving the tables away as a gift.
3,Accurate and technical,"Provides a great reference on the development of German Stormtrooper tactics during World War One. This is the best reference book on the subject. I gave this book only a 3 star rating because it is sparse on illustrations, does not provide as much detail as I would like on equipment, and provided almost no insight into the allied response to these tactics. This is still a great book as far as it goes, I just would have liked the scope to have been a bit broader."
2,"Neat, but expensive. Found better alternatives.","We tried 8x8 years ago, but it was simply too expensive. We needed 5 phones, but didn't need 5 unlimited calling plans.At the time, the only real alternative was something like Vonage. Problem with Vonage was they really didn't support multiple lines necessary for an office environment.Then finally, we discovered a company called voiSip that has really been great for us. They let you use whatever phones and equipment you like (though you should probably at least use their recommendations).And voiSip lets you use as many lines and phones as your equipment and Internet will support, at no extra charge. Just buy your equipment, pick a minute plan that fits your office, connect and go. Call quality and features are top notch.I've even got voiSip's 6 dollar plan for my home with nice 2-line phones all over the house. So now I can order a pizza while the wife is talking to her mom, and I don't have to run downstairs for my cell phone."
5,Virtual Office is EXCELLENT value,"I rely on Virtual Office every day for my business and continue to be amazed by the versatility and programmability. Features other providers charge for are simply included. I've read other reviews on here comparing Virtual Office poorly against another service, but that's a residential service, I'm not sure that makes sense. We have a rock-solid DSL connection through Earthlink and 5 people can be on the phone and on the net and we've never had any problems with quality. In dealing with customer service I find I pretty much get the kind of treatment I give out, but then I've never really had any serious problems and haven't needed to contact them after the initial installation phase. This is definitely worth giving a try for a small business that wants the image and features a zillion dollar corporate phone system offers, but at a fraction of the price."
5,Great Phone!,This phone is amazing!! Clear quality and good phone! Never had any problems!!! Best VOIP Phone I have used so far!!!!
1,Dc Talk - horrible follower of trends,"This is a horrible album. How could anyone be into this band? I would highly recommend to NOT buy this! If you want Dc Talk to take you for the ride of whatever is ""hot"", then be my guest, but if you have not heard them before, I would suggest to keep walking on by...."
5,arguably best live album - secular or Christian - in 10 yrs,"dc talk began as a hip hop trio back in the early 90s when Christian music was trying to niche their way into all different styles. After proving themselves with positive album sales, dc talk began doing THEIR kind of thing -- writing and singing great tunes in the ""alternative"" genre. This CD came to me via the influence of my parish's youth group, and boasts energetic offerings from the band's recent Jesus Freak CD and other interesting cuts -- The Beatles' ""Help!"" medley with ""So Help Me God"", REM's ""The End Of The World As We Know It"" and their own reworking of The Doobies' ""Jesus Is Just Alright"". One particular standout track is ""Coloured People"". This band has what it takes: talent, humour, energy, and stage presence (implied in the Seattle crowd's reactions). Along with Stevie's Natural Wonder CD set, this is the best live set since ""Stop Making Sense"" and the Boss' ""Live 1975/1985""."
5,Energy on this disc is amazing,"My ""Welcome to the Freak Show"" Disc has gotten the most play by far out of my 50 CD collection...If you are a dc talk fan and havent picked this one up, I promise it is the best one they have put out..Im surprised mine hasn't started to skip after 5 years. The energy these guys put into a show almost makes ME tired. Especially like their cover of REM's ""End of the World as we know it"" and the ""Like it, Love it, Need It"" tune is one of their best in my opinion."
3,Down with the DC TALK,"This album now seems so dated, but i remeber when it came out that it was just chocked full of energy. The guys really know how to jam and this was a great capturing of their energy. The cover of Jesus is just alright is one of their best tunes."
3,I can't believe I'm saying this about dc Talk!,"I enjoy all of dc Talk's other albums. Supernatural took a little getting used to. But this cd, if you've been to the Jesus Freak show that they put on, it's almost EXACTLY what you saw there. On a good note, I love the soulful remdition of the song ""The Hard Way"". It's everything a live song should be! I recommend this cd basically to the dc Talk fans who never got to witness them in concert during their Jesus Freak era. If you were there, you might not benefit too much from this."
5,I COULDN'T KEEP THIS CD SO...,...I HAD THE CD COPIED BY THE FRIEND I BOUGHT IT FOR BECAUSE I LOVE DC TALK AND I THINK THAT THEY ARE THE BEST ARTISTS OUT THERE AND THEY RULE!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,"if yuo want to rock for christ,this cdis for you.","i relly liked this cd, i usily am not too thiled with concert cd but this was vary good. i felt like it has soem of the best that dc talk did. it had many of my perosnal favoits. i also liked that ti took osme seculer songs like help and it the end f the world and maide them into christan songs. i relly enjoyed how the songeres opned up and ashered soem experiences as they intordeuced the songs. i loved that my two all time dc tlak singles wear on it. what foi i stubled,what if i fall. i was disopunted that the rendion of i wish we alll be rady was not on it. if you want a good rcok cd with a uplfing mesege,but this cd."
2,Could've been studio recorded.,"I did not completely like this album; they just HAVE to have the crappy applauding from a live concert after each song, which gets to be somewhat annoying. In addition, when I first got the album and played it, after listening to the first two songs, I thought I was listening to an album from the Beatles. I do not recommend this album."
2,They Should be Arrested for trying to cover R.E.M.,"Awful, awful, awful covers plague this album. I'm sure it will be nominated for a million dove awards (what a joke those things can be). D"
4,"It's great, but has a few shortcomings","I'd like to just say that as much as I like the cd, I think that unless you listen to it on a huge speaker system, it just lacks punch. I mean, hey, it was supposed to be heard live, so they get just a bit off tune and screamy once in a while, something that you don't notice in a concert when you're hyper. I'm not trying to dis it; it is definitely worth the money. Just don't expect ""Jesus Freak."""
5,It is a great cd and I would highly recomend it.,"This is one of the best cd's because it has some of their best songs on it. I would highly recomend it to anyone. It has songs like Jesus Freak, In The Light, and Colored People. Buy it!"
3,First time I played a soccer game on playstation,The amateur level is like average level for me and pro level is impossible to beat. They (other team) pass the ball before you can get to them. So you can't even get the ball back. This game is too hard on top of they (game creators) spent too much time on the soundtrack when you can't even select a song you want. Not enough camera angles either or game modes. Poor game overall. Only good thing is all the teams and players they have.
1,disappointed,Did not work tried it on 2 different computers. Returned item. I had a very unhappy 9 year old. Also there was no book inside the case cover.
5,The Greatest Star Wars game EVER!!!,This game is awesome! tou get to play on planets from all star wars episodes Including episode 3! there are tons of vehicles and planets ranging from the endor scout speeder to the incredible AT-AT! In instant action you can play on any planet or above any planet in a space battle! and if you do mos eisly asault you can play as any of the heros except there normal soldier units!this truly is the greatest game I have ever played.
4,Best Star Wars Game Ever,"Wow...That's all I have to say. This game is magnificant and tops all other star wars games. You have the ability of playing from 20 something levels and choosing or playing as a variety of characters. The graphics are intense and the gameplay is great. For any great Star Wars fanatics interested in choosing a top-quality game, go with this one...cause you won't be disappointed."
3,What happend?,"I bought it a week ago, and I got this a day before yesterday. And I inserted the CD in my computer(Labtop) and I pressed play. When the game started, the background is all wierd! It flickers. I don't know why is it happening. First, I doubt that it was a part of game. But if it's right, if I pause the game, the background has to be still. But it still flickers. What happened? The game IS fun, but what's wrong? Is my computer's graphic card or something is wrong?"
4,A Wonderful Little Treasure of a Book,"This book is a wonderful love story. I love Vangie Worth, and the way that Susan Wilson tells her story is quite unique. She switches from different times and places, and the way she weaves her tale the reader is carried away with it. It's like reading about a quite lovely dream. This is a poignant love story that lasts through five decades even though the two people only are together for 7 months so long ago. Reading this book is like slipping into a warm, scented, steaming bath. Give yourself the pleasure."
4,Sluglicious!,"My boys and I love this book. I'm going to purchase the hardcover edition for them and my nephews/niece.Colorful engaging art, fun visual perspectives, authentic northwest illustrations and main character is what gives this book the most charm. The story is light, playful and adventurous.This is one we have read and checked out from the library many times. Luckily they do not clammer for it, rather nicely they welcome its addition to the library pile.I think an appropriate age range is one to four or to five, depending on the child. This is one of many books that I'll recall their childhood with.Thank you Mary and Lorie!"

4,Drugs and Murder in Miami,"A shadowy figure with immense power and money decides to take over the cocaine trade in Miami. It requires, of course, killing his rivals. Chris Meadows, a young, Miami architect, is only dimly aware of the drug trade until an old girlfriend and her child are accidentally killed before his eyes by hitmen. Worse, he can identify the killers, so he becomes their target. When a police detective seems more interested in using Chris for bait to catch the killers than in protecting him, Chris decides that he is on his own. His terrified twists and turns to evade the killers take him through the deadly world of Miami's drug scene. Hiaasen and Montalbano, writers for the Miami Herald, put an authentic edge on a Miami that tourists don't see. This is not the Hiaasen who writes biting humor about Florida's developers and politicians. This is the Hiaasen who gives us a thriller steeped in Miami. The story will keep you reading."
3,Disappointed,"I am a long time fan of Carl Hiassen and have read nearly all of his books, always eagerly looking forward to his next book. But for me, Powder Burn was a huge disappointment. I found the story line mundane and predictable. As always, however, his characters are original, clever and realistic. I'm not even sure why he wrote this book and it can only be described as ordinary. read it if you can't find anything else to read, but don't expect much and don't pay full price for it!"
3,Hiaasen is trying new type of book?,This was a okay book. I miss the early people he had in his first few books. They were books I could forget the real world with. I will try again. Until I receive my Kindle I had forgot about him. It is so easy to look up books on amazon I have found many arthur that I use to read.
3,Not bad for what it is,"Like ""Trap Line"" (and unlike the very mediocre ""A Death in China""), this novel works pretty well because the authors really know the subject and the environment they're writing about. Perhaps the biggest flaw: when implicated in a murder, Meadows (the main character) never seems to consider contacting an attorney--which would be the first thing any intelligent, rational person (as he is supposed to be) would do. This is the kind of defect that makes the entire book seem weak. We know it's fiction, but it should at least be theoretically believable. Maybe this is the legacy of Hiaasen's usual off-the-wall black humor fantasies."
5,"all you who downed audio adreniline, this message is for you",YYYYYYYYYYOOOOOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU SSSSSSSSSUUUUUUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKKK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Something new.,"Some people really dont like this album and some people loves it.This is not the kind of ""fun"" album that AA use to produce. Its deeper and more complicated than Dont Censor me and BloOm.Some people say that the lyrics are too simple but they are not!I like Some Kind of Zombie, Mark shows the people that he might be one of the best singers in the world!"
1,DOnt know how to describe this music?,This cd is weird. Some parts of the songs sound good like the beginning of new body but then gets lame when the singer sings. DOnt get me wrong I respect Audio Adrenaline because their last album was alright but this cd is just uh weird. If you dont want to waste your money dont buy this cd!
1,Audio Adrenaline need to rethink their music again,"Audio Adrenaline is a band who have stated that their goal is to get ""bigger"". Well, they have achieved this goal, they are now one of the most popular groups in contemporary christian rock today. However, their music has not gotten much better since their sophmore effort, ""Don't censor me."" The album title, ""Some kind of zombie"" does not portray anything to do with a christian's life- a zombie is a imaginary being that is living yet dead. A bit of a contradiction, don't you think? Audio A needs to get back to the basics. They need to put more adrenaline in their music. They need to focus on what made them a good group before- good writing with good vocals.I don't encourage this CD. For real contemporary christian rock, check out DC Talk, Petra, or even Reality Check. (John Elefante's good too...)"
3,its audio a,"This band has changed a lot, nonetheless I like them. They aren't my fav(third day) but I like them. Their old stuff I like but the fake drums aren't for me. I'm not going to say they suck or bad mouth them because If I don't like something it doesn't mean some one else doesn't. we all have opinions. I read one interview that said a cd sucked and to get the newsboys, I honestly don't like the news boys much. But sense I like bloom and their new cd underdog AND some of their old stuff I'll give it a 3. God bless"
4,A good New look for AA,This is CD is really cool. The title track is awsome and songs like Blitz are cool too. I would get it.
3,"ok, not as good as the previous one","the CD was Ok, but i problably would have liked it better if bloom hadn't been so awesome. while some of the tunes are catchy, it doesn't compare to what they had"
5,Works Great,This personal heater/fan works very well in a small space or mid-size room. It warms or cools whichever you need. A little expensive but worth it on rainy/cold days.

4,Great Range and Balance,"First a little about me, i have played alto saxophone for years but on and off and not professionally. I do play to get 'taste' and 'style' to my music. The mouth piece is key to feel and adaptability for me.This piece is great for balance and range and ease of use. It can be used for all style of music, though i haven't tried any other mouth pieces except a Vito II and a Rico. This piece is a major upgrade for me and works well.Mouthpieces are subjective to the player, though a beginner/intermediate should be happy with this mouthpiece"
3,Inexpensive Below Average compact player.,"Brought this product couple of week before. Tried to play couple of audio CD's. It plays good but if you move the player little the sound gets interrupted, so its not good for using when workout or sports. It gives you quite lot of futures but player look like not really robust and durable. Its a Inexpensive below average player available in the market."
3,Acceptable for price,"I had a defective tape adapter when I got it, but Amazon immediately sent me a new one before I even sent in the old one. They work fairly well, but they do skip if you move it around alot. It makes a good little portlable vcd player though. If you mount it to a stationary position (in your car) it works pretty good. With all the functions included and the remote I'd say it's a good deal. Just don't expect to go hiking or jogging with it."
1,a cheap stuff n not all cheap stuff is good,I would not buy this item again...coz the body of this is too bad n the red color is awful
3,Minor Beethoven.,"You will find four CDs in the Naxos catalogue in which Jeno Jando plays Beethoven bagatelles. The earliest to be released features the marvellous three sets to which opus numbers were given. This CD is the first of the three others, comprising miscellaneous short piano works of Beethoven. Some bagatelles are here, including the well-known ""f√ºr Elise"" which opens this collection. Once you've heard ""f√ºr Elise"", however, you'll listen in vain for anything here with any spark or substance. Beethoven would probably turn in his Viennese grave if he knew that there was a pianist like Jeno Jando who would devote 57 minutes to playing these inconsequential items to a 21st Century audience. Naxos's regular note-writer, Keith Anderson, provides a scholarly and objective essay."
4,Good book.,I really liked this book and the story held my attention. The only complaint I had was that Jack never really had to suffer for all the things he did. And boy did he deserve to suffer!
2,good girls,The book was small paperback.Not a good size for our library.That is the problem with ordering fromind. dealers.No size is given.
2,Mislabeled,"I bought this to study the connection between Hindu & Egyptian mysticism and mirror mythology, but was very disappointed. It's mostly wishy-washy vagaries about getting a person in touch with the astral plane. There's very little reliable referencing to actual ancient beliefs, and instead sounds more like Delaurence was attempting to fuse different systems he'd studied into some new, simplified route to ""enlightenment"". It would be more appropriate to call it ""The Wanna-Be-Genuine Psychics Text Book"". Who knows, maybe those looking for such a book would benefit."
3,"I love zap mama, but...","this ep was not that impressive. it was just ""OK"". it is already on the bottom of my cd stack. so sad that any zap mama album made it there."
5,My Fav Zap Mama Album,"I'm a big fan of Zap Mama ---- however, I sometimes wish their tracks could go a bit faster -- this album takes care of that, giving some bigger beats behind their beautiful vocals, in addition to some guest vocals that really add a beautiful harmony to the entire trackAt the very least, this album is worth it only for the beautiful song POETRY MAN ---- this might be one of the most beautiful songs ever made within our modern timesGive Zap Mama a spin and take in the beautiful beats that can relax a soul and put one back into ease"
2,Misleading Subtitle,"No matter Caldwell's argument for focusing--almost exclusively--on New York City (it's easier to research NYC, he says on the last page of the intro), his subtitle suggests a wider range. James and Wharton have told us more about NYC manners than Caldwell, trapped inside nonfiction's perimeters and by a bloodless style, can approach. Looking to the rest of the United States, then, would have had the meritorious effect of opening his topic up beyond the much-overdone."
4,Smart and Interesting Read,"Caldwell is an excellent writer, although his diction can be frustratingly obscure, as if he's showing off. The book offers a balanced view point and interesting topics and examples. I especially liked his discussion of Martha Stewart. Very strong argument explaining how morality and manners are entwined, and later how they become entangled with consumerism."
5,Beach going without the pain,Whoever invented this beach wheeler deserves a medal. Makes life so easy to pile on beach chairs and towels and bags and... it's great. How did i ever live without it?
4,Awesome Laser!!,I got this laser for christmas and it is way cool. It works really well and lasts forever. It has a slick design too. It makes you feel special. Star gazers need this to be effective. It is a great teaching tool.
3,Used ridgid tool kit.,"The tools work fine, but they were not in as good of condition as I would of thought. They need to be a little more clear that a recondtion meant a full refurbished tool."
3,Good for the price. However...,The tools were undoubtely used. The drill was the worst. The main problem was that the battery socket on the drill was broken. The rest Ok. Still worth it.
3,Ok but had problems with the drill,My drill had problems from the start. The trigger was faulty and it sometimes stayed on and also went from 0 to max rpm no matter how softly it was engaged. I sent it to the service center and it took 3 plus months to get it back. The chuck had a serious oscillating wobble to it which they did not even fix. No precision drilling with this tool. the other parts of the kit work adequately for cordless. I prefer my Makita cordless though.
3,Not Enough Answers,"I felt this book had some decent advice, but it was not detailed enough when it came to sharing specific examples. I was looking for something that would give me and my three-year-old son some ideas on how to handle leaving him at preschool when he'd cling on to me as if I were going to throw him into a lion's cage. Do you peel him off and leave? Do you sit on the sidelines with him still hanging on? How long should you plan on staying in the classroom? A week? A month? However long the child wants/needs you there? And when do you make the determination that he is not ready/ready for school?I had SO MANY questions and was dismayed to discover this book, although shedding a lot of light on the shy child, gave too few answers on what to do in common situations."
2,Not enough practical advice,"I didn't find this book that useful. I thought the analysis was pretty pedestrian and not that insightful but I was particularly distressed not to get more practical advice. A disappointment--if you are looking for concrete strategies to help your child's shyness, I would not recommend this book."
4,Great Live CD,"I was lucky enough to be at this show at the Merriweather Post Pavilion in columbia, Md during the summer of 1987. All but one song on the CD was recorded at this venue. The Kinks were really on fire that evening, even though it was raining outside. There were rumors that it was filmed that evening. I'm hoping at some point in time that this footage will show up on a DVD since we have not seen the Kinks since 1995. If your a Kinks fan, this is a must for the collection.."
3,not my favorate history book,"direct translation of the Chinese Classics, some of the articles are hard to understand without any explanations. Not a very interesting book to read."
3,Good Live Recording,"Michael Nesmith and his crackerjack band do a good job showcasing songs from his latest CD at that time: Tropical Campfires. For myself, I like the earlier songs he did with the First National Band and Red Rhodes (his steel guitar player); those songs include: Joanne, Silver Moon, Some of Shelly's Blues, Propinquity(great vocals from Nesmith), Harmony Constant, and Different Drum. The audience noise is kept to a minimum and the live recording is very good."
4,Love this set!,I bought this set because it was the only one my husband and I could agree on. We bought it without knowing the sex of the baby and recently found out it's a girl! The colors are so pretty and the snoopy and family is just precious. It is a little on the expensive side and I wish we could have bought some things separate. All in all it's a great item. I got some pink blankets that go perfectly with it. It's great for boy or girl and the items you can buy with it are endless! I gave it four stars only because The sheet ripped without even using it. I put it on the matress to see what it all looked like together and as soon as I tried to take it off it ripped a hole in the corner. It's a little cheap if you ask me so I will just buy some pink ones. Like I said... my baby isn't here yet and hasn't slept on it. Beside that it is a great product and would definitely recommend!
4,The Monster Show,"The Monster Show is a sort of ""best of"" cd from Lordi's first two albums. If you want to get some Lordi but don't want to spend a lot of money, this is a good a way as any to get a listen. My favorite tracks are Blood Red Sandman, My Heaven is Your Hell, Devil is a Loser, Icon of Dominance, and Wake the Snake. It comes with a DVD with some music videos on it. Very nice."
2,OH LORDI this cd sucks!!!!!,"First off, I'm a huge GWAR FAN! I saw the cover of this cd,and thought to myself ""Hmmmm? GWAR RIP OFF'S? "" And that's just what they are!!! The cd it's self is very lame, like old 80's Glam metal hair band crap! I could not even make it half way through this cd. If this band did not have the monster costumes they would have nothing! Bottom line- lame monster costumes and lame music. Don't waste your money!!!! Go buy the new GWAR ""WAR PARTY"" cd if you want awesome monsters and kick-A$$ metal!! No one will ever top GWAR!!!! EVER!!!!!! LONG LIVE GWAR!!!!!"
3,I say hand wash rather than Dish wash,"It says that it is dishwasher safe, but I say that it holds up better by hand washing because when it is in a dishwasher just like any other wood it absorbs the water that it is in so if you wash all dirty in the dish washer that would be why it tends to stink after 6 months. It absorbed all of the smells and odors of different food that cycled throughout the dishwasher and it is now ciphering the odors through the epicurean board. Other than that one miss communication I think the product is a great product."
2,mediocre quality,"I thought this board was attractive and seemed like it would be a good product however, I've had this board for approx 6 months and although it was nice for the first couple months, I have seen black bits from the board the last few times I've used it. Also I've noticed a bad smell coming from the board even though I thoroughly clean it after each use."
2,Pretty but not practical,"This cutting board looks lovely and would look good for a cheese display. However, it is not all that durable. Basically, every time you cut pieces of the board end up on your food leaving little black specks everywhere. I won't venture a guess as to whether this is healthy or not. It does not have any grooves around the edges to catch juices so it's only practical for cutting things that won't run. It does clean well in the dishwasher. I wouldn't buy it again."
5,Greatest little cutting board on Earth,"This cutting board is lightweight, more resilient than glass or plastic, easier on knives and goes in the dishwasher. I love mine so much that I am now giving them for hostess gifts."
1,"Black Fibers, too","I also have black bits coming off of my board onto my food. I have had the board a couple years and put it in the dishwasher. I have since started hand washing it. I know that cutting boards need to be replaced over time, but I feel this product fell apart too easily."
1,Beware of black fibers,"I purchased the black epicurean cutting board 4 months ago. Originally we were very pleased with it. Easy to clean, no odors however over the last few weeks we have found that the black coating is peeeling and you can find traces of it in the food. Example, black specks in the chopped garlic. I believe this a serious concern. I do not recommend this board to anyone."
1,Great for cutting... awful on the nose and taste buds!,"Honestly, this is a great board for cutting.Unfortunately, I also have a sense of smell and a sense of taste.The board reeks of chemicals when washed... hand-washed.Also, if you leave something on the board for more than a minute or so and the board is wet (for instance, cutting onions, fruit, or anything that leaves a liquid), the food tastes like the cutting board smells.Make sense?I won't buy this again. There are other cutting boards out there that don't have this issue."
1,board wears out...black surface starts to fall apart and flecks into food,"I loved this board at the beginning, but over time, it began to wear down and I also started to find pieces of it in my cut vegetables. I thought it looked like specks of pepper, but then I did a big chopping job and discovered it was actually the board falling apart as I cut into it. I brought this up at the local cooking store and others had seen this as well. I would not recommend using this board."
1,Contaminants?: Poly resin(?) scraped off of cutting board!,"My experience was as follows: A considerable amount of poly resin came off the cutting board and likely into the food. Whenever I scraped this cutting board with my knife, there was a considerable amount of poly resin that comes off the cutting board and likely in contact with the food. I have found this to be the case with every poly or poly blended cutting board I have tested. Whether or not the scrapings are food safe, I don't know. Irrespective of the safety of the scrapings, I do not want the scrapings in my food! I can't believe NSF gave this product their blessing! I am sticking with unfinished 100% wood or bamboo cutting boards for all of my non-meat prep items."
5,The first cutting board I love,This cutting board is quite expensive but worth every penny. The size is perfect for small jobs such as fruits and small pieces of meat. There are cheaper cutting boards that will do the job (you know those flimsy pieces of plastic) but I love having a sturdy small cutting board. I can't describe it but it's just a joy to use which means I actually want to use it which means one less obstacle against me cooking for myself.
4,Excellent cutting board but the fact that it skids makes it a tad dangerous to use,I bought this cutting board from Bed Bath and Beyond (had a 20% off coupon). I like the board and it doesn't spoil the knife. My problem with this board is that it moves when you cut something on it. I used to place it over 2 table mats and that too care of that problem but I wanted a more permanent solution. So I attached anti-skid pads to one and now I have the perfect cutting board. Of course this now leaves me with only one working side but I'm ok with that because I now find the board a lot safer to use.
4,Good board - stylish and clean,"I like this board for what it is. Looks good, can throw it in the dishwasher. I would not use it with a machete to cut coconuts, but for fine chopping it is great.Also great as a cheese board at parties."
1,bonded with Richlite,"These boards are bonded with Phenol Formaldehyde. According to the material safety sheet, this is toxic under extreme heat and alkali conditions. Does that sound food safe to you? Aren't some foods alkaline? What about the acid in your stomach? Could that affect cutting board particles that are ingested? (I know, acid, not alkaline - but still...) Just food for thought."
3,Disappointed in the Durability,"This product is very stylish and looks great on the counter. Its nice that it is dishwasher safe and very thin, but the cutting surface is scarred by knifes very quickly. If this is not a problem it is a great product otherwise."
2,Not for the long haul,Worked at Bed Bath and Beyond and pushed these cutting boards because they are supposed to not harbor bacteria and be good for knives and do not crack unlike bamboo. I have now had 3 for 5 years. They do not hold up to time. While they are better than plastic and glass cutting boards BY FAR for your knives my expensive knives still dulled easily on these boards. I also liked that they could go in the dishwasher but after only 1 year of use they are totally warped making cutting difficult and they are greying or white from drying out in the dishwasher. Unlike wood cutting boards they don't take to food safe mineral oil. Other than the nice large surface and slim design for storage these are so not worth the damage they did to my knives and the fact that they don't last. I recently purchased proteak and love them!
5,Great American Made Cutting Board!,"I got this cutting board for Christmas. I love it. I especially love that it's made in the USA, is knife friendly and dishwasher safe. I have a feeling I will be using this cutting board for years (possibly decades?) to come. Good quality is worth the price; good American made quality is worth twice the price."
2,Too thin and light,"The cutting board is very thin and light, so it is difficult to handle dough on it. Despite that it claimed to be resistant to cutting, I still got lots of visible lines after using it for a week."
5,Best board I have owned,"This is by far the best cutting surface I have ever owned. Have had one now for 3 years and might be willing to sand it down for the scratches, but they aren't causing me any trouble... The board is light, heatproof, and with a little scrap of that rubber shelf liner stuff under it, more stable than the huge butcher block board it replaced. It works well with ceramic and steel knives and I am planning on buying some for my mother, that won't own anything that isn't dishwasher safe ;-)"
5,The almost perfect cutting board,"I love this board. It's dishwasher safe (does not warp like others), the juice groove keeps my counters clean when cutting up a chicken or block of tofu. It's also light and has not gotten furry with use the way the plastic ones do after a while. If you have granite counters you will want to keep a cloth under it(rubber shelf liner used for delicate glassware works best) to keep the board from sliding around when you chop. If you tend to whack the board with your knife instead of rocking the blade get a wooden cutting board to better protect your knife edge."
1,Smell *awful* when wet,"Got this board as a gift, and was excited because it's all natural/eco-friendly, can be used as a trivet, etc. Then I washed it. It smells like... wet particle board... because that's what it is. When it's dry, there's no smell. The thing is, most foods have some amount of moisture in them. I don't want the smell leeching in to my food. Returned it the very next day."
3,I am not 100% impressed given the price,"Pros:- Light weight- Cab be tossed in the dishwahserCons:- Shows cut marks very easily, I have used mine for about a month and it is already showing signs of serious wear. The cutting board is still working and doing its job, but just doesn't look new. Compared to a cheap regular polyethylene cutting board, the plastic definitely shows less sign of wear!- It is so light that cutting on it feels like cutting on a glass surface which I don't like. I like the feeling of cutting on a wooden board or a plastic board more, there's less ""shock""."
3,Great for the first year...,First let me say I like the design and the cutting surface of this board. And I like the whole recycle ethic. It probably got used more than any of the other dozen boards in my kitchen. But trying to pick black specs out of my onions gets old real fast.I have boards over 30 years old that don't shed wood or polyethylene. This is clearly a product with a limited lifetime. When I contacted Epicurean about the problem their solution was just to sand the board down to a level where it doesn't shed black particles. How may months does that buy me before I have to sand it again?The real problem here is that the board is not dishwasher safe. It's breaking down because was not designed to withstand the active ingredients in the detergents. This is not what I paid for.
2,Warped and spins while using.,I bought this because of it being lightweight. Unfortunately it arrived slightly warped. It's difficult to use because it moves when trying to use it. We put a nonskid sheet underneath but that didn't help. I also don't like that it doesn't have a groove around the perimeter to catch liquid so it just flows over the edge which makes a big mess because of the board moving. Put it away in the pantry and took out the old corian cutting board.
3,It Warps,Maybe our Dishwasher has a curse on it... Every board we use except glass and thick wood warps. I bought this in the hopes it would not warp..... It warps too. So the claim... at least with my dishwasher of not warping is not true. Otherwise I really like them. The black is looks really cool too.
5,Excellent Cutting Board!,"This is my favorite cutting board - I want it in multiple sizes and to ditch my plastic boards. It is thin and lightweight, very easy to clean, has stood up well to many many chopping sessions. It does not show knife marks, warp like natural wood can, and it's made of an environmentally responsible material. I often use this on top of my big fancy block board to keep the big board clean. Highly recommended."
2,"Great for a while, then broke down","I've had this cutting board for around 5 years now, hand washing it half the time, using the dishwasher if I cut meats or anything else on it. It did fine with knives, never seeming to dull them, and it looks very nice, but it's started to break down after going in the dishwasher again. The resin seems to break down after a while and little bits of wood product are coming up off the board, so I'll certainly never use it again. Unfortunately, even if it's done well for 5 years, I'd rather buy something else that I don't have to worry about breaking down and introducing wood products and resins into my food."
5,Wonderfully helpful,"This little book is the wisdom of one of the Grande Dames of the natural healing world. Everything has been tried over generations, and the directions are clear and to the point. The A-Z format makes it really accessible to anyone. Thanks to Hay House for reformatting this amazing information!"
2,Luke Warm Chicken Soup,"I should have been suspicious when there was such a nice round number of secrets of happy people. I now realize that many of the secrets are effectively redundant. The book consists of 100 fluffy 3-part chapters, for lack of a better word. The first part is a one paragraph summary of the ""secret"", the second is a SHORT description of ONE example of the principle in action (some of these seemed much more apt than others), and the third part is a one paragraph summary of some actual research that coalesces the data into people-who-do-this-are-X%-happier /unhappier. The ""chapters"" rarely, if ever, exceed 2 pages in length and, as another reviewer mentioned, there is a lot of white spacce. About the only thing I really liked about the book was that it did cite the original research. Overall, I think this would have made a better desk calendar."
4,"Come on, get happy!","Niven has created a highly readable abstract of the best lessons learned from scientific studies into happiness and life satisfaction. With so much research being done in these areas, it's delightful to see the science applied and presented in a engaging, useful manner.Reading through the brief, concise lessons you'll discover some things you already knew... and a few things you may have wondered about. Plus, you'll get a quick example of how the lesson applies to daily life as well as the reference to the study/research behind each idea.As a professional life coach, I recommend this book to all of my clients and encourage them to use it as a low-cost, year-long self-improvement course by having them read 2 lessons a week and focusing on applying those lessons in their daily lives.This little book is a hidden gem in the field of personal development and self-help. Anyone looking for simple, common-sense, EFFECTIVE ideas to improve their lives will want to read this book."
2,"be happy, save your money","The book does indeed contain 100 entriesbut other than that the title is misleading.First of all there are no secrets. Theauthor repeats common homespun wisdom onecan find anywhere. Second there are lotsof claims like 'group A is 35% happier thangroup B' . Really now, I wonder what unitshappiness is measured in. Such attempts tohijack math to achieve respectability areludicrous and so is this book."
2,"Good topic , Poor presentation","I could not finish the book as I know there are better ones in the market and would rather spent time reading those.Every chapter I read , did not make me feel that I learned something here and was wondering what really author is trying to convey here..I wish i had checked this book at some bookstore before buying."
2,simplistic tripe,"""scientists have learned"" he says, but he backs up his pap with ... nothing. This is just another of the multitude of ""one page a day"" self-help books."
2,left much to be desired,This had some good word from word data and information. Thats all. It was impersonal. Pictures would have helped tremendously.
5,GOOD MUSIC PLUS VERY FUN,THIS IS VERY FUN MUSIC FROM ELMER BERNSTIEN WHOM I ACTUALLY NEVER HEARD OF UNTIL HE COMPOSED THE RAINMAKER BUT I LOVE HIS MUSIC FROM THIS MOVIE I LOVE THE MAIN TITLE. YOU SHOULD BUY THIS CD IF YOU WANT FUN MUSIC.
5,EXTREMELY WELL DONE,"Normally, tribute albums come up pathetically short of the original. This album is the exception. All the artists involved stay true to each song by keeping the same spirit of the Beatles while sprinkling in their own influence. Best song on the Album could very well be Ben Harper's version of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"". The Crowes' ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" and Eddie Vedder's ""You've got ot hide your love away"" are right up there as well."
1,Useless Cover Songs,"None of these songs compare favorably to the Beatles' originals. I always ask, ""why bother covering a song if you're not going to add something new or interpret it in an unusual way?"" This soundtrack has me asking that again and again. I am especially irked that the film contained all sorts of Beatles trivia, quotes, and general underlying theme, yet contained not one note of original Beatles recording. Everyone looks to the Beatles as a crucial stage in the evolution of pop music -- buy their albums instead of this."
1,"Man, can they get any lower than this?","""You can't reheat a souffle,"" said Sir Paul McCartney. And the artists on this album have unintentionally proved that he's right! Why try to improve on something that's already better than everything else out there? I almost died after hearing some stupid fool plodding along slowly through ""Revolution""; and a bunch of teenage-sounding guys screaming ""I'm Only Sleeping."" The latter of these two songs particularly made me think ""They have taken a great song off one of the greatest albums, (""Revolver"") and messed it up, they turned it into a rock and roll thing, when the original Beatles track was more acoustic. There are very few high points, only ""Two of Us,"" ""I'm Looking Through You"" and ""You've Got to Hide Your Love Away,"" which is a great cover. Besides those three, the covers on this album are disgraceful. These singers should be ashamed of themselves."
2,The World Does Not Need Another Cover Album,"It's not the worst Beatles covers ever, but the soundtrack to this film doesn't work because most of the song versions are way too faithful to the timeless originals. Being these are some of my favorite musicians, I was disappointed at the lack of creativity shown throughout the CD. With that said, standouts include Ben Harper's reworking of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"", done with almost a smoky, burning intensity, and Rufus Wainwright's rendition of ""Across the Universe"". Get it if you like the Beatles, but you may be disappointed with the staleness of it all."
1,"Boomers, Run! As fast as you can!","Unless you're wearing hasmat gloves & goggles to destroy all copies in print, run for your life (no pun intended).Not that Beatles compositions are above covering (Joe Cocker, Grant Green, etc.), but if you're just going to do a cloying remake that adds nothing...""I better stop now, 'cause I got a weak heart."""
5,Ben Folds is a genius,"Worth it for the Folds alone.Although, Ben Harper, Eddie, and Nick Cave really add to the album as well."
4,"Great idea, pretty good music...","For those of you who have not yet seen the movie, you should do so. The acting is brilliant and the soundtrack is very fitting. The idea for the soundtrack is even better, with new interpretations of Beatles classics by various artists. Aimee Mann's duet performance of ""Two of Us"" was very well done, as well as Sarah McLachlan's ""Blackbird"" and Sheryl Crow's ""Mother Nature's Son."" However, instead of buying the CD, i chose to download the mp3 versions of the songs (a wise decision on my behalf). After downloading the entire album, i was fairly dissapointed with songs 12 and on. In fact, i suggest that you download the first eleven tracks, and save your money. It is certainly not worth purchasing ..."
4,For any Beatles fan this is this is a must!,"Nearly the whole Cd being Beatles covers, this album satisfies any age. The first time listening to the songs you enjoy just the mere fact of hearing the difference in the original recordings vs the remakes by an eclectic group of artists. For the younger generation there are many favorites such as a surprising sarah mclachlan who is taking a break from music at the moment, eddie vedder of pearl jam, the black crowes, and my favorite ben harper. This is one of those CD's that you can pop in and just listen to the whole thing without skipping a song. The CD is very mellow and mostly acoustic. For any Beatles fan, it isnt quit the Beatles harmonizing vocal sound but there are sure plenty of great covers on this CD and you should be overly satisfied. I would recomend, one of the better CD's I have bought in a while."
2,"Please, No more",The Best thing about this album is it reminds us how great the Beatles were! I give two stars because of the excellent cover of Two of Us. Buy Beatles albums instead.
2,Could have done better.,"There were a few good covers, but I think if they had used the real Beatles songs, it would have fit the movie so much better. It's a shame that it didn't work out that way."
5,Beautiful Covers.,"I usually would scoff at the idea of an album of Beatles covers, but the renditions featured on this terrific soundtrack to the new Sean Penn film are so lovingly and passionately rendered, they simply melt my heart. Thus far, I can't get enough of Rufus Wainwright's stunning remake of the George Harrison penned classic ""Across The Universe"" as well as other sterling contributions from Sarah McLachlan and Eddie Vedder to name a few. To me, re-recording Beatles tunes is sacred and not to be trifled with, but this collection actually manages to get it right most of the time."
2,Beatles Covers,"I only purchased this CD for the cover of ""Hide Your LoveAway"" performed by Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam. It, along with theAimee Mann's ""Two Of Us"" are the only two songs worthhaving. The other performances are either overproduced, or thevocalists are forcing themselves to try and sound like Lennon. Had Irealized the entire CD was Beatles covers...Igive the CD a 0, with Eddie and Aimee's tracks as a 5. If there were aCD single, I would have gotten it instead."
1,These songs are not good ...,"I'm surprised by all the gushing about this album. To me, it is a really, really bland collection of music. Most of these versions do not sound all THAT different from the originals ... they're just worse, that's all. The Black Crowes doing Lucy in the Sky with Daimonds is hilarious in its wretchedness.To me, the lone exceptional track in this collection of junk is Grandaddy's Revolution. It's an interesting version--kinda strange and refreshingly surprising ... which is something I CANNOT say for anything else here."
1,Really?,"How bout some feicken instructions on how to download???!!! Paid for product, cant get it! THIS is why people download illeagally!"
3,Cover tunes,"Why do people insist that cover tunes should sound exactly like or ""in the same style"" as the original? Eddie Vedder hoarsely singing vocals over the same song isn't interesting at all. The Grandaddy cover of Revolution is what this album should be about, a clever interpretation of a great song. If you want to listen to Beatles songs sung just like John and Paul, then buy one of the 85,000 Beatles compliations already out there."
2,Have you noticed that covers usually aren't that good?,"I like this CD only because it reminds me of how excellent the originals are. Otherwise, it's nothing but middle-of-the-road alternative artists (with the exception of Eddie Vedder) wandering through this pointless waste of time and money. These ""tributes"" range from mildly irritating to simply nauseating. If you don't believe me, all you have to do is listen to both versions of each song. Then I'm sure you'll understand... And, to me, Nick Cave covering ""Let It Be"" is like hearing Fidel Castro singing the ""Star-Spangled Banner""."
4,Risky,"Hey, covering the Beatles is always a risky game, especially with as large and eclectic an effort as this one. But on this album there are at least two diamonds, from Sheryl Crowe and Sarah McLachlin, that alone are EASILY worth the price of admission. Sarah's Blackbird and Sheryl's Mother Nature's Son are faithful tributes comfortably familiar to hard-core Beatles fans, but which are also powerful renderings by two accomplished artists who effortlessly and delicately weave their own interpretations into these new versions. There are creditable renditions too, of Lucy in the Sky, I'm Looking Through You, Strawberry Fields Forever, Two Of Us, and Across The Universe. The latter though was soaringly surpassed by Fiona Apple's cover on the Pleasantville soundtrack - the I Am Sam producers missed a unique opportunity to use her version here."
3,Okay...but,"Okay...i grant you the songs are great, but this tribute album is not. Here's my bias: i'm a 50+ audiophile who remembers from actual experience Beatles hysteria...when we'd wait at the record store on the day a new Beatles record came out, then when we got it home we'd listen to it continuously till we knew every word, note, inference, and nuance. This collection succeeds only in making me want to hear the originals instead. (Honey, get out the CD burner, we've got to show these kids what real Beatles music is all about.) Not one version on this collection holds a candle to the original...attesting to the staying power of the originals after all these years. And, by the way...i love the wallflowers, but their contribution here is as lame as lame can be. All in all, and adventure in mediocrity."
5,Excellent Beatle's Covers,If your movie budget can't afford to use the real Beatles then this is pretty darn good. IF Beatles originals are A+ this CD is B+.
3,It's not the Beatles...,"...but it still has some merit. I'm a pretty big Beatles fan, grew up with parents that were fans. I bought this CD based upon the strength of Eddie Vedder's cover of ""You've Got to Hide Your Love Away"" and found that much of the CD is highly enjoyable.It's not the Beatles, if you are the sort of person that will be highly disturbed if it should not properly represent the Beatles, don't buy it. Yes, all of the songs were John and/or Paul songs. Yes, some of the covers are much less than stellar. But I feel it's worth it for Eddie Vedder's cover, Rufus Wainwright's cover of All Across the Universe (beautiful), and Ben Harper's cover of Strawberry Fields."
2,Interesting idea...but falls short of good,I like the Beatles. I like the idea of people covering the Beatles. I just don't agree with the selection of people they chose.The best track on the disc is Eddie Vedder's. The rest are just...there to sell a disc.Borrow it and then burn it.
3,Beatles Fanatic,"Up until now, the only Beatles cover worth it's studio time was Stevie Wonder's ""We Can Work It Out"". The funniest thing about this soundtrack is that the more established artists didn't mess with the Beatles original productions much and made their contributions true tributes. The newer, lesser known artists went nuts changing and rearranging the songs in some sickening attempt to prove themselves! Fortunately we're spared this horrible blasphemy until the latter half of the CD. ""Julia"" is totally massacred as is ""Revolution"". Beatles fans will not be able to deal with this. Highlights are Ben Harper with ""Strawberry Fields"" and Aimee Mann/Michael Penn on ""Two Of Us"". Those two cuts are worth buying the whole CD for."
5,Beatles classics with new talent,This is a great CD if you like Beatles at all. The artists singing these songs are VERY good and you'll probably find a new artist that you'll love. (Rufus Wainwright is my new find. These artists do put a new shine on great songs. I an very glad I bought it!
2,"Good thought, not well executed","The idea of having all these great Beatles songs done by various modern artists sounds like a great idea. Unfortunately, I got nothing out of this CD. It wasn't like listening to something different fom the Beatles original versions, but instead they were just worse. All in all, I just feel dissapointed. This CD will not be in my player very often."
4,Excellent,"This soundtrack is excellent, just like the film. This soundtrack contains a load of different artists that seem to blend well together and make it worth listening to. The standout tracks for me are, Wall Flowers, (Im Looking Through), Sheryl Crow (Mother Natures Son), Nick Cave (Let It Be) and Stereophonics (Dont Let Me Down). Most of the other reviewers like this cd, so we all cant be wrong so i recommend that you go and buy this cd"
3,"Just Ok, but I really liked a few...","I was not quite as impressed with this album as some of the other reviewers. I will say that the ""You've Got to Hide Your Love Away"" cover by Eddie Vedder is better to me than the original Beatles version! However, this is sadly not the case with most of the songs. I found that many of the songs are ok but really not as good as the originals; for instance Lucy in the Sky and Let it Be which are two of my all time Beatles favorites. Many of the covers fail to leave any lasting impression at all and the rest are notable for being pretty bad. I enjoyed this soundtrack a lot more when I was watching the movie!"
3,C'mon!,"Please! I understand that each artist has a way of singing and playing, but this is terrible!!! The most tender and loving songs, like ""Julia"" have become rockers, and vica versa. Since when is ""Help!"" a lullaby?!? And another thing, the artists are supposed to play the songs, not rewrite them!!! I could barely recognize ""Revolution!"" I'm only giving this a 3 because ""Two of Us"" and ""Mother Nature's Son"" are the BEST!!!"
4,Good Enough To Play,"This is a selection that my wife picked up, and as with most of her music I am very skeptical at first and sometimes am glad I gave it a chance later (ref. Barenaked Ladies, Tori Amos, etc.) I would say that you should buy this album just to get the cool version of Revolution done by Grandaddy which is a stellar band. I just groove that song. The rest of it is the Beatles, which was barely acceptable done by them (IMO) and then covered doesn't help a whole lot. If you want great rock from that era, check out the Rolling Stones."
2,"I like the Beatles, does that mean I'm mentally challenged?",the heavy metal tribute CD to the Beatles is much better 'cause the head bangers are MUCH more mentally challenged and I think that is why they do a much better job. I mean when Ozzy goes coocoo ca choocoocoo ca choocoocoo ca choocoocoo ca choocoocoo ca choocoocoo ca choocoocoo ca choocoocoo ca choocoocoo ca choocoocoo ca choocoocoo ca choo coocoo ca choocoocoo ca choocoocoo ca choocoocoo ca choocoocoo ca choocoocoo ca choocoocoo ca choocoocoo ca choocoocoo ca choocoocoo ca choocoocoo ca choo I mean that says it all doesn't it?
1,poor,"received cd scratched so bad will not play, no jewel case, no liner notes. None of this was mentioned by the seller. Very dissatisfied. Do not reccomend this seller. Will not purchase from this seller again."
1,Ghastly,"This is piece of filth. Beatles songs should not EVER be covered--especially by this untalented menagerie of ""performers."" The ghoul who sanctioned this album should be tracked down and psychologically evaluated (and imprisoned with a life sentence). I would never wish the trauma associated with listening to this garbage on my worst enemies. The songs are butchered beyond belief and some are almost unrecognizable. I shouldn't have expected any better based on the quality of the film and cast. Any true Beatles fan will be horrified by how badly these treasured songs were brutally maimed. I honestly get nauseous when seeing the track listing. I have never even heard of most of these singers (for good reason, obviously). So please do EVERYONE a favor and buy the original Beatles albums if you want to hear the songs the way they were meant to be heard."
1,A Travesty,"I accidently heard this and think it is a terrible album. Why would anybody in their right mind want to listen to bad cover versions of classic songs by mediocre ""artists?"" Why not listen to the originals? Nobody should be allowed to touch The Beatles' music. Ever. The horrible versions of ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" and the masterpiece ""Let it Be"" are especially heinous, but they are all terrible in their own ways. Some are almost insulting. The people contributing to this soundtrack can only wish that they'll be remembered and relevant in 40 years. Maybe I'm sounding harsh, but if you are truly a Beatles fan, you will probably agree with me. Oh, and the movie was terrible too."
4,I just listened to I AM SAM again for the umteenth time.....,and I still love it. I love the Beatles. I believe their songs are wonderful and should be sung by as many artists as possible. It's great to hear other artists interpretation of such famous songs. The words are worthy of hearing and this album is worthy of listening to.
5,An over the top soundtrack!,"If you are a fan of the Beatles then this is a must have album. The Beatles covers done on this album are absolutely wonderful. There are only two songs which I am not completely sold on the covers, but overall this is an excellent addtion to your Beatles collection musically. The songs on this album complement the movie and are able to take you back to the scenes in the movie as if you are watching it again."
3,Beatles do it best!,"Ok...I suppose my opinion may be a little bias considering I am a huge Beatles fan. I was a little nervous to listen to tracks from this cd. Alot of artists have been sampled throughout the years..which is cool, but when it comes to my Beatles..it better be damn good. First off, Eddie Vedder was great, his rendition was unique but still honored the original version. Revolution and Let it Be, were a different story. I felt these songs were ""changed"" to much from the original version. The Beatles were and are awesome and in no way do their songs need to be changed. I will probally order this cd simply because I am a huge Beatles fan and feel for the most part that it is a good cover of their songs. Lets just say 70% of the cd I feel is pretty decent. I guess when it comes to the Beatles I like their songs just the way they are...so Let it Be:)"
4,Hit or Miss with Beatles Covers,"As a Beatles fan, I was intrigued by the I am Sam soundtrouck, a collection of Lennon/McCartney songs. I found a couple of the covers very well done, including Blackbird, Across the Universe and I'm Only Sleeping. However, there are some moderate disappointments, mostly attributable to too much artistic creativity.Anyway, I enjoy the CD, and it presents us Beatles fan not only with something fresh but some quality covers."
3,Beatle imitation,It's just a little boring - the versions are just TOO true to the originals. Any Beatle fan will enjoy it!
3,It's spotty but there are some keepers,"Title speaks for itself. The aimee mann/michael penn duet is lovely. The sara mclachlan tune sounds ""treated"" but i have a soft spot for her voice (however enhanced). Rufus wainwright's contribution is pretty straightforward if his voice is anything but. As a matter of fact, the first eight tracks are nice ear candy, save for ben harper's take on strawberry fields. for my money, the ben folds song is the best of the lot. the rest ranges from uninspired to downright forgettable (heather nova's breathy cover of ""we can work it out"" has no clue where it is or what it wants to do) except for nick cave's treatment of ""let it be""."
5,Passing of the torch,"I am one of many who believe the Beatles are the greatest band ever and it saddens me that they can no longer record their music This group of songs gives me hope for the future. The various renditions are true to the originals without being mere apings. The artists allow their own musical styles to surface while paying respect to the originals by not changing the overall tone of the songs. Blackbird by Sarah McLachlan is the best version I have ever heard, and is worth price of the CD."
4,Beatles I can love,"I am not a beatles fan. In fact, I have disturbing memories from my childhood, falling asleep with the radio on, only to be awakened by the Beatles singing Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds. This album, however, contains the only Beatles songs I ever did like. We (my teenage kids and I) especially like the remade versions Blackbird (though I must admit I like the original, too) and Strawberry Fields. We love Rufus Wrainwright and Ben Folds. I am no music critic, no expert. I just like this CD a lot."
3,"OK , could have been better","I love the beatles, and i think this CD could have been better. The best song is let is be by nick cave, closely followed by strawberry fields forever by ben harper and then blackbird by sarah maclaughlin and you've got to hide your love away by eddie vedder. The other songs are forgettable. Fiona Apple does a good version of across the universe that i would have like to have seen on here."
3,Do your homework,"Sean Penn wanted the orig Beatles tunes...they wouldn't give him the rights, so he used other artists' versions.I wrote this comment to address those who commented that Penn should have used orig Beatles music. I personally think the renditions of the classic Beatles tunes are great."
2,Interesting but not reccomended,"Theres really only a couple of good renditions on here. Two of Us,Youve got to hide your love, Im only sleeping, and maybe Across the universe.Dont let me down is tolerable too. Otherwise theres alot of crap. Revolution is unlistenable, mother natures son sung by Sheryl Crow doesnt even sound like her, its sounds like Britney Spears. Im looking through you is weak, Let it Be is pointless. It just goes to show you that you dont mess with Beatle songs, they are sacred. Best Beatle cover ever is She said ,She said by Government Mule."
3,Sadly disappointed,"I received an e-mail regarding Eddie Vedder's rendition of ""You've got to hide your love away"" and I was hooked, what a fantastic job he did. So, I ran right out and purchased this album. There are many songs on this album that are my favorite. Sarah McClachlan does a phenominal rendition of ""Blackbird"" and well, Eddie Vedder is fantastic!Sterophonics didn't do too bad with their version of ""Don't Let Me Down"" but the last 4 songs on the album....please, they totally ruined these songs. ""Revolution"" is suppose to make you hyper NOT put you to sleep. Where is the emotion in ""Let it Be""? I have never heard a monotone song until now. I don't recall John Lennon being nasally on ""Nowhere Man"". ""Help"" desperately needed help. If you can't sing the songs the way they were meant to be sang, don't try. Pick a country song.I grew up listening to the Beatles and love them very much. If I had to do it again, I would have listened to all of it before I purchased it."
3,interesting!,"Some of the songs on this album I'd never heard of before seeing the movie I Am Sam. Although I'd have to say the contributions of Sarah McLachlan, The Black Crowes, and Rufus Waynewright are all great!"
1,Don't buy this if you like the Beatles,THe CD was made in the intintion to remake Beatles songs. NOT REWRITE THEM ALL TOGETHER! THe songs sound nothing alike the original versions except for a few. If you have any heart for the Beatles DON'T buy this CD
2,"face it, no one does it better then the beatles",&#65279;i would have to say it was a mistake buying this album. the majority of the songs suck. it's sounds like it's been slapped together over night. they butchered all the classics. if you are a real beatles fan this cd will do nothing but aggravate you. but if you actually enjoyed this cd and your not a beatles fan i suggest buying any one of beatles albums.
3,"the originals are always better, but...",... kudos to grandaddy for trying something different. very very cool.most of the rest are just shameful.
3,Decent.,"As opposed to some of the other reviewers, I rather liked this album. True, not every track is good (a few are *bad*) but many are great. Ben Harper does a great job on Strawberry Fields, and ""Country Boy"" is wonderful. Though the original Blackbird will never be replaced, Sarah does a good job here. Rufus Wainwright's version of Across the Universe is alright, but they ought to have used Fiona Apple's, it's killer.All in all, I'd suggest simply downloading a few tracks unless you really enjoy beatles covers as I do. Some are better than the originals, in my opinion.~14:30"
4,"""I Am Sam"" Soundtrack Review","I was disappointed with what other had to say about the CD. You know from the start that the songs are going to be COVERS and therefore aren't SUPPOSED to sound exactly like the originals. Many of my friends who are die-hard fans still enjoyed hearing their favorite lyrics, just with a new twist. I think that the soundtrack goes along with the movie great and really enjoyed the tie-ins."
2,Like crossing a peacock with a variety of farm animals.,"My opinion, before listening to this CD and after, is this: ninety-nine percent of the time, covers of Beatles songs are just irritating. This album is well produced, and the arrangements well thought out - but in spite of this, the only positive thing I can say about it as a whole is that it shows by contrast what a class act the Beatles really were. The people who wrote those songs were the right people to perform and record them, and most all attempts by others to reinterpret them in their own way (sometimes in a radically different way, as is true with much of this album) come up short at best. At worst, they are the musical equivalent of spray-painted graffiti on a masterpiece. On ""I Am Sam"", there are examples of both. In terms of concept, some are interesting, albeit misguided, and some are utter [junk]. Buyer beware."
4,Keep An Open Mind,"First, a warning: if you're the kind of person who holds Beatles music sacrosanct, and believes nobody but the Beatles should be playing Beatles songs, you'll probably dislike this album intensely. Stay away from it.For the rest of us (those of us who prefer that our music not be trapped in amber): if you like to hear good songs thoughtfully reinterpreted, this is the album for you. Some covers will probably appeal more than others, according to taste, but don't let your preconceptions stand in the way of liking a song on its merits - for instance, I'm not any kind of fan of Eddie Vedder or the Stereophonics in other contexts, but their respective cover versions here are favorites of mine.So, once again: if you don't believe any popular music recorded since 1970 is worthy of your attention, don't buy this album. Everyone else: open your mind and your ears, and give it a spin."
2,Too Safe,"Although there are some excellent musicians on this CD, they play it too safe. Most groups are trying too hard to sound like the original songs and they add nothing. The only exception is The Chocolate Genius' excellent version of Julia. Most sound like the original tune on Prozac. What would Let It Be sound like if sung by Ringo Starr? Listen to Nick Cave's version to find out. Grandaddy's sloppy version of Revolution is downright annoying.Rule: If you can't make it better, don't do it. I would rather hear the originals.For die hard Beatle Tribute band fans only.[DW]"
4,It's OK...,"I like Walker's other stuff, so I was curious about this CD. Why is it so darn expensive, for one thing!Masters CDs of this type are usually mixed quite well. This CD is no exception. Even at ADD, the quality is nice to listen to.The content? As said, it's OK. Nothing stupendous, amazing or the like. Sounds a lot like what you would expect from an early Walker self-release.Warm Front is better, still, I don't regret getting it."
5,Good start for Russian,"If the Russian language is totally unknown to you, the book provides you in a easy way to become familiar with the cyrillic letters and handwritten scipt. At the end it is possible to read streetnames, names of buildings, the most important information on tickets, etc. It gives also useble information about Russia and Russian life. A real good start."
5,Learning the Russian language,"My husband and I are going to Russia at the end of this year, and are trying to learn the basics of the language. This book is an easy to read book!"
4,Good Intro to Reading Russian,"This book helped me find my way around Russia. It introduces the Russian alphabet and common letter combinations, so words are easier to decipher for the beginning Russian learner. During 3 business trips to Russia, I was able to make out most signs along the street, subway and airport by using info in this book. I highly recommend this to those who need a quick solid intro to the written Russian language. Good for tourists and business travelers."
2,A bit disappointed...,"For the cost of this book, I expected more. My hope was that it would help me refine my understanding and use of Russian script. It contained about two pages of script exposition, nothing more than anyother teach-yourself type course does. If you are completely illiterate in the language, you may get some benefit from this book, but if you can read even a little Russian already, you're too advanced for the scope of this material."
3,"Good book, but probably overkill to learn cyrillic","This is a good book, but it's likely that you'll find all the information you'll need on learning printed and handwritten cyrillic in any comprehensive text, like the New Penguin Russian Course.I suppose since it does what it's supposed to do pretty well I should give it four stars, but the book is rather small, not all that cheap, and frankly I expected more. Maybe I expected more because the Teach Yourself series Russian Grammar book is so much better."
3,Needs the physical writing process,"I just purchased this book today, and now wish I'd spent more time thumbing through it in the book store. From the title, I assumed that it would teach how to read and write the Russian (Cyrillic) alphabet. I have a hard time memorizing something by just looking at it, so I wanted a book that concentrated on how to write the alphabet as well. Although this book does include a section on Cyrillic cursive, I did not feel comfortable writing either Cyrillic block letters or cursive based on the information in this book. There is no stroke order or direction given, so the reader is left to guess how to replicate the given character.Other than that, this is a cute little book, well priced, that will get you through reading the Cyrillic alphabet and some beginning vocabulary."
2,"This book is extremely light, on the text I mean.","I went through this book in several days. It taught me nothing more than how to read Russian and pronounce words that mostly look or sound like English words. I would definitely recommend saving your money and buy ""The New Penguin Russian Course: A Complete Course for Beginners (Penguin Handbooks) (Paperback)"" instead."
2,A bit too easy,"I had a basic grasp of the Cyrillic alphabet already having used free online Russian language resources and thought that this book would clear up some of its peculiarities. It did not. The pronunciations of the Cyrillic x or that ""shsh"" character are not explained completely, and the alternative pronunciations of some characters are not mentioned at all. The basics of the Cyrillic alphabet are taught in excessive detail, while missing are some of the important inconsistencies common in Russian words.""Teach Yourself Beginner's Russian"" provides a much more concise and yet more detailed overview of the Cyrillic alphabet. Combined with sufficient Russian text which can be easily found online (I used the flight manual of a Russian MiG-29 ""Fulcrum"" fighter aircraft), the Cyrillic alphabet is not difficult to learn."
2,"Decent book for absolute beginners in Russian, but BAD TITLE","This might be fine for someone who wanted practice in reading the Russian alphabet. However, I made the mistake of taking the title literally. I can read (or at least sound out) Russian books, but I have trouble reading or writing cursive Russian, which often looks quite different from the printed font. There is hardly any material on handwriting the language."
2,Continua la gran estafa del rock,Desafortunadamente Rotten y Mclaren siguen peleados y deberian sacar un video de su reunion. Pero en fin es un video que debe estar en la coleccion de un verdadero Fan Pistols. El documental es muy aburrido pero tiene algunos buenos detalles.
5,4 years and counting....,"I have had this laptop for 4 years now. To this day, I love it and it competes with recently released laptops in terms of processing power, size, and overall comfort of use. Only downside would be the battery life but thats what a charger is for. Well worth the money."
4,The Norton Anthology of business books,I like cracking this book open to read it only a few pages at a time. It is well organized and the summaries thought provoking.
4,Lovely fixture.,"Very substantial piece. The shades clip on the bulbs so they sometimes sit a bit crooked, but that is easily remedied. Love all the sparkle of the drops."
3,Great Whites and the Pacfic Region,"If you are fasinated by the Great White Shark, you are going to like this documentray film. As the Discovery Channel as done in the past the quality of this one is the same... very good. This film highlights what the Great Whites that are associated with the pacific region do as far as traveling, what they prey on and what impacts the sharks within this area have on the areas around them. I would recommend this film to anyone that is geniunely fascinated with the Great White shark."
5,Just what I was looking for.,"I like the way the watch fits, looks, and works. It is comfortable and Unique looking. The variety of functions is very useful. It has improved my work out quite a bit!"
1,Negative stars are more fitting,I am a mathematics teacher. I have been teaching high school and college students for a great number of years. This book is tailored for A Level students and this is probably why it survived the onslaught of years. The authors fail in stating accurate definitions and lack rigor in their derivations.
5,You Need This Book,"Yes, I know it's out-of-print, but but it used, but BUY IT! If you like to cook simple but delicious food, this book is a must. The explanations and techniques are marvelous and the food is even better. Clearly written and easy to follow - a cook's dream."
3,Kids seem to like it,"I bought this book for a storyteller to read during a community Halloween event which I coordinated. The children seemed to love it - and my 2-year-old daughter asked for it every night of October - but I thought the artwork was a bit bland and the story was kind of boring. If you are reading it out loud, over and over, the constant ""hic hic hic"" will get old."
5,A review by Cameron,Skeleton Hiccups is about a skeleton who has the hiccups and he tries and tries to get rid of them. He poured water down his throat and it came out of his eyes! He plays ball with a ghost and he ate sugar. I like this book because it is silly.
5,Fun Book!,My one year old loves this book.Its about a skeleton who has the hiccups and can't get rid of them. The illutrations are great and it's a lot of fun. A great Halloween book that can be read at any time of year!
4,Fun for students,"I used this book for a Halloween project for our school's after school program. The kids really enjoyed the story. Following its reading, we made a skeleton from Q-Tips. Will use this idea again in future years."
2,Good Idea but TV doesn't work,Received this as a Christmas gift. The TV portion of this is useless in my area. I couldn't get any TV reception at all. The radio part worked okay. Perhaps better to find something a bit lighter and smaller that does the same thing.
5,From the Ground Up - Buy It Now! It's Fab!,"A friend of mine turned me on to Antigone Rising, and this CD in particular. I listed to it one time and have not been able to STOP listening to it since. I bought a copy of my own and it's in the CD player in the car and I listen to it everyday. (My husband wants to know when I'm going to change the CD; it's been in there for 6 months now.) Then I got another one so I could have it in the house, too. I love the music, the variety of songs, the great beats, their beautiful voices and fabulous harmonies, the eclectic music styles all wrapped up together. How every song is different, and how they write about true stuff. ""I don't need someone else to make me feel myself."" I cannot get enough of AR and neither can all my friends cuz now we've all bought AR CDs for everyone else we know."
5,a fantastic and very talanted surprise,"what a surprise. what music. what talent. oh my gosh, the whole album blew me away and I'll bet I'm one of your oldest fans. 66 years old and a music junkie for all my life so I was pleased to find your album so exciting. just wish you could come to Orlando, Fl. if you ever book here do it at UCF. University of Central Florida, now the largest student population in Florida and the third largest in the country. YEAH !"
5,BUY THIS CD!,"Unbelieveable! I saw this group on one of those early morning shows and couldn't believe the beautiful harmony and the lead singer's fantastic voice. One word comes to mind when describing this group and that is ""HEART"" with a more robust sound. Even though this is a live performance which I normally don't buy, you don't even notice the clapping. Your mind completely tunes that out. Really, I can't be more clear - BUY THIS CD! It's FANTASTIC and you will love it. I already can't wait for their next CD. These girls ROCK! *****"
1,If you think this is Rock then your just ashamed to admit that you like Country,Melissa Etheridge meets the Dixie Chicks. Nuff said.
5,Antigone Rising,"Jay leno announced them,but I missed the name-then the group came on tv-5 good-looking females-(lead vocal,2 guitarists, bassist drummer)all w really good talent.They sure had stage presence, and they blew me away with their sound. When their song ended, I wanted to hear another. I looked up leno's guest list, got their name, ordered their CD and have been playing it and no other since. They write their own songs, and each one is really good at what they do, so together, they are as good , if not better, than any and all ""famous'groups out there. IMHO."
4,Nice.,"I heard this cd last year in a coffeeshop and really liked it. After I left the coffeeshop, I forgot about them. I recently bought it at a used cd store, plugged it in, and haven't stopped listening to it since. I also bought the KT Tunstall cd, which is amazing.Buy both...highly recommended!"
2,Shouldn't Have Been Me,"My mistake. I had only heard ""Should've Been The One"" which I thought sounded very good. That, however, was the only song produced in the studio and unfortunately the only song I liked enough to justify the purchase. The rest of the songs are live, apparently recorded at a small venue, if you can judge by the applause. Like I said...my fault. Not saying any of the songs are bad. Maybe more of them will grow on me. Just not what I expected. Moral: it pays to listen to most of a CD before you buy it.(duh) You never know what you're gonna get."
2,Sapphic Country Rock,"Acoustic blandness masquerading as country/rock-politan sung in a big, vacuous voice...or is that sentence redundant? Anyway, you've heard it all before, for better or worse, with it's [their] biggest sin the mediocrity it [they] seem to celebrate. Blame faceless, corporate rock machinations. Blame VH1. Me, I blame Melissa Etheridge. My grade: C+"
5,Completely Satisfied,"I purchased a ""used"" but never opened CD from this seller and I am completely satisfied with my purchase. The CD came to me still in the shrink wrap and it plays like a brand new CD. I would definately purchase from this seller again!"
1,Don't bother,"I listened to the first 5 tracks - skimmed through tracks 6, 7, 8 and 9. At track 10 I threw it out the car window. Nuff said."
3,Big letdown after The Instigator,"After his brilliant solo debut ablum, The Instigator, The Believer is a big letdown for former Old 97's frontman, Rhett Miller. None of the energy, inspiration and power of his first album. Producer George Drakoulias really watered down the songs and over-produced it, suffocating Rhett's natural talents, and some well written songs. Too bad. One redeeming factor, bass player Salim Nourallah (not on the first album) really shines through as a major talent. An award winning producer himself, Salim and Rhett should have produced the album. It would have come out much better."
2,Old 97s it ain't,"After listening to this CD twice, I just wondered to myself, why did Rhett feel the need to make it? It is pretty much watery pop songs that were not good enough to make an Old 97s album. I still like and respect Rhett, but this album is just not very innovative or good. Some real cotton candy songs, none of which are memorable at all."
4,Smart & Fun,"Only thing better than the record is Miller doing this stuff live. With his looks, how can Hollywood be far away?"
1,The Yawner,"I just tried to listen to this record again and decided it needs to head off to the Goodwill so I don't again make the mistake of thinking ""Let's give this another spin."" It's always a mystery how an artist can follow up a really swell album (such as The Instigator) with a completely dull effort like this. The most interesting things about the album are the snazzy outfits Miller wears in the picture on the cover and insert."
3,Handy for large quantity cooking,"Purchased this product about a year ago. The red looks great, the pieces are easy to assemble and clean, and food prep is easy enough. The down side is that it overheats very quickly and then stops operating until it cools down. You also have to be careful to with hot or warm foods. It won't work until the food has cooled. Odd and frustrating when the middle of cooking.Found myself using it less and less over time. I've discovered that unless I'm cooking for more than 6 people, and in large quantities, I find it to be too much work to pull out of the cabinet, put it together, and then clean all the peices. Also, since I use it so infrequently, it's frustrating to have it overheat if more than 10 onions or other vegetable is sliced.For smaller jobs, I've come to rely on the mini cuisinart processor/chopper. Less bulky and easier to handle. Handy for the occasional large job, but probably could have managed fine without it."
4,Strong Work!,"If you even like this kinda stuff in the slightest, you won't be disappointed. Great performances from almost all of the contributors (Evan Dando?). Plays more like an eclectic yet entertaining compilation than a 'same-y' tribute album. Once again, the Cowboy Junkies make me eat my disparaging words; their version of Ooh Las Vegas truly stands out and is arguably their best work since they covered Lou Reed's Sweet Jane - someone should tell them to keep looking for covers that fit them really really well. Another someone important should give Emmylou Harris a medal for this."
3,it sent me looking for my parsons cds,"This is a very pleasant, well-meaning tribute album, but as Steve Forbert once said in a song, it's ""just too f**kin' slow""! I liked this disc because I have come to love the songs that are covered here. And I like most of the people that cover them. But after listening, my strongest reaction was that I wanted to hear Gram sing these songs. One pet peeve: Cowboy Junkies, you need a makeover!!!! The approach of ""let's slow everything down"" is getting so old. By the way, there's an ealier Parson tribute called ""Commemorativo"" or something like that. It has some interesting covers, too. Much as I like Whiskeytown, Peter Holsapple and Susan Cowsill's cover of ""A Song For You"" on that disc is the superior version."
3,Buy the Real Thing,"3 stars for a noble effort, as tribute collections go, and Harris' presence lends an air of authenticity to this project. Nevertheless, I urge you to opt instead for the original recordings by Parsons himself. There really is no comparison."
5,One of the best releases this year,"Most tribute albums miss the mark but this one is a bull's eye. There isn't a bad track on this CD. Some of the standouts include Whiskeytown's version of ""A Song For You"" and the perfect combination of Lucinda Williams and David Crosby on ""Return of the Grievous Angel.""By far one of the best albums in the past year, joining Steve Earle's ""The Mountain"" and Tom Wait's ""Mule Variations."""
5,Why you guys don't provide 10 stars for this?,"Every tracks of this album are so stunning, esp. Sleepless Nights and A Song for You. You will have to find Gram Parsons's work to guarantee his talent."
3,average,"I was a little disappointed, I expected better with Emmy Lou in charge. It is an ok cd but not one I will play very often."
1,return of the grievous angel falls short of being a tribute,"The untimely death of gram parsons was certainly a loss to the music world. luckilly, for those who were not alive or aware when gram was recording and performing, many of his recordings are still available. this tribute, masterminded by emmylou harris, who got her start with parsons as a back-up singer, falls sadly short of being a tribute. despite the inclusion of obvious graduates of the gram parsons schoolof songwriting (wilco and emmylou), and others certainly influenced by the late artist (lucinda williams, steve earle), this collection of parsons' songs seems to lack the soul of the originals. although the choice of material is good, the performances lack the mood and emotion that is so prevalent in the original recordings."
2,"Love Emmylou, but this is disappointing","My expectations were admittedly high for this project ... expectations that were dashed by the rather blase renditions of Parson's work. Evan Dando, who has performed several Parsons classics live over the years, disappoints in his half-hearted collaboration with Juliana Hatfield on $1,000 Wedding (one of my fave Parsons songs). Whiskeytown's somnambulent reading of ""A Song for You"" (another of my faves) is a crushing blow. On a positive note, the Cowboy Junkies interesting, surreal take on ""Ooh Las Vegas"" packs a whallop; Chryssie Hynde and Emmylou's harmonies on ""She"" are simply gorgeous; and Lucinda Williams and David Crosby (!) team up for an inspired trip through the album's title track.Alas, these gems are not enough to save the project from sinking. Seek out the other Gram Parsons tribute (Conmemorativo), which resonates with more emotion and depth than this collection."
3,Get the original instead,"This album is OK, but it can't hold a candle to the orignal Gram Parsons albums. Spend your money on the originals and get twice as much soul for your buck."
1,"Nothing really redeeming, liked only one song",Old style with mostly kinda honky-tonk or crying in the bar music with newer voicings.If you like older style country music from the late fifties or early sixties you may like this
1,Horrible and Creepy!,"I love cat stories and that is why i bought this book, it left a bad taste in my heart, i read it with an open mind and did not find that he was kind to cats, he did not have a cat spirit inside and he did not seem to learn anything about his cats. This book seems to be a cheap print to target cat lovers and make some money. This book is just HORRIBLE and CREEPY!"
5,Senior writer/explorer develops awareness of cats.,"In his many years of travel and artistic and psychic exploration, Mr. Burroughs encountered a wide variety of mentalities. Whether or not they were comprehensible to the rest of us, he described them and commented on their apparent roles in the universe. When he finally settled outside an east Kansas college town, he gradually became strongly involved with those small, furry, almost-alien creatures we call cats. Why humans interact so deeply with some nonhuman species, and even how those species arose, are questions this small, poetic book considers. It is much more though, a record of a man's emotional interactions with some quite different types of mind and what they revealed to him. At the least, it may bring the reader to pause at the next encounter with a cat of the house or street, and carefully consider the reserved appraisal one receives from those clear eyes"
5,I Cried All Night!,"I just finished reading this book. Not only is it a very fast read (I read it in an hour), but it is also the most touching book I have read in a long while. Any cat lover will love this book. This is my first taste of Burroughs, and I must say it was a wonderful taste. I have been crying ever since he spoke of Ed and not being able to find him. I highly recomend this book for anyone!"
3,Two out of Three,"This is an excellent - being both informative and well written- book about the theory and research on perfectionism. It is not a good resourse for treatment options or interventions. The theory and research portions of the book are useful in conceptualizing a psychological understanding of perfectionism, but for the treatment you would need another resource."
5,"Options, Future and Derivatives",This is a wonderful textbook which I am looking for. Author has completly covered most of the topics related to options and derivatives. The complexities of math is well presented which makes readers easily digest the hard portion of financial concept!
4,"Worthy Music, Worthy Performance, Less Worthy DVD","Mr. Podessa's review covers the good points of this opera adequately. It's a new work to me; I've never heard a note of it nor looked at the score. The logical comparisons would be with Berg's Wozzeck and Lulu, or Janacek's Makropoulos Case. The Hindemith stands up to such comparison musically, perhaps less complex and bold than the others but more colored and easier to hear immediately. I also like the Doktor Caligari staging; it's hard to imagine any other would be as appropriate for this post-Freudian opera. Now, however, the weakness: the sound transfer is tinny, distant, and without nuance. Even on my very good equipment, played at a volume as loud as I could bear, I felt I was listening to a car radio. What a pity! I've knocked off one star only because I'm in a cheerful mood; another time I might have knocked off two."
4,Great Album!,"I like this album because it is a classic record from the ""hair metal"" era. The only thing is, it has too much of a metal crunch. Of course, it is Alice who has changed with the times repeatedly. Maybe not well commercially, I still enjoy it."
4,Cooper's Rocking Again!!!,"Alice Cooper continues in the world of heavy metal with a followup to 1986's Constrictor album. Where Constrictor was a fair album ,this one is a definite improvement and in many ways underrated. This is a very bloody Alice album and harder rocking than most of his other efforts. The album contains alot of quality songs such as Prince of Darkness,Roses On White Lace, and Freedom. Plus check out the improved guitar work of Kane Roberts. This album shows that Cooper is indeed back and rocking hard. Definitely worth checking out, to hear some Cooper in a slightly heavier direction."
4,Jimi Jae,"A must for all Cooper Fans. In the days (years) following the ""Nightmare Returns"" era came this release. I searched everywhere to find it. Clas-sick Cooper at his best. Great tunes. If your the timid type - great for halloween parties or scaring your conservative neighboors. May be used to keep religious solicitors from the door. If you like Alice, you'll love this release.Jimi the Bass PlayerSo California"
4,Sick Album,"Raise your Fist and yell is a Cooper Classic. From the opening track ""Freedom,"" to the insanity of ""Gail"", and ""Roses on white Lace"", this album does not disapoint. The Guitar playing and drumming are as great as Cooper's ""tounge in Cheek"" lyrics. (IE. the end of chop, chop, chop, into Gail) The only negatives for this cd would be the bad 80's wet production and the filler song Give the Radio Back.Great album, buy it!"
3,Really Heavy!,"I'm a Fan of 80's Alice Cooper. I do like the stuff before and after but my favorites are his 80's albums. This is my least favorite of the 80's albums by Alice. This album came out in 1987 to my knowledge. To me this album has a really heavy sound to it. I would say metal is a good word. I think the only song that I could listen to on repeat was Gail, a hunting song about a corpse. Other than that the rest of the album was a really hard to listen to. I think Alice was trying out metal music but not really wanting to go on with it. I say this because after this album follows Trash his 1989 release. It had more pop and rock to it. If you dig metal music by this but if you want Alice on a lighter note buy Constrictor or Trash!"
2,No,"I love Alice Cooper. Frankly, he's tied with the Beatles as my favourite all-time artist. So believe me when I say this is his worst effort. (Dada is maybe tied for this distinction.) You should buy it -- and yes you should buy it -- as the last album to complete your collection. Hey, everyone is allowed a weak album every three decades."
4,An underrated effort by the Coop,"Alice Cooper's ""Raise Your Fist and Yell"" is a very well-conceived and tightly played album. I bought this when it came out in 1987. I felt it was a HUGE improvement over ""Constrictor"" in songwriting and musicianship.The tracks, especially the last four tracks, are classic aggresive Alice. Kane Roberts playing on ""Roses on White Lace"" is amazing! I never could convince any of the ""Metal Heads"" at my high school of the greatness of this album. I recently listened to this album about five times one week because it still rocks!! In fact, I would say this album has gained with time.If you want to listen to some Heavy Metal style Alice, then give this a spin. Please overlook ""Constrictor"", ""Trash"", and ""Hey Stoopid"". There are good tracks on those records, but none of them has the sheer brutality and power of ""Raise your Fist and Yell""."
5,Roberts and Winger,Kane Roberts and Kip Winger contribute to this release from Alice Cooper and really bring the music to life. Winger's sense of rhythm and background vocals make everything better and Roberts can play guitar with the best of them. These songs are rockers and this is one of my favorites by the Coop.
3,"Ahh,,,Alice, you gotta love him",As lyrically childish as we'd expect of Alice Cooper and as brazenly in your face as we'd hope him to be. Great band!!! Get this just to hear Kane Roberts tear it up on guitar. Wow!
3,A Return to Form,"""Raise Your Fist And Yell"" puts the wallop into the music that Alice really needed to get back on track. Much denser and more in line with the state of music in the late 80's than ""Constrictor,"" this was Alice rocking like he hadn't rocked since ""Welcome To My Nightmare"" or B$B. What was still lacking was decent songs.""Freedom"" actually pulled down a fair amount of radio play at the time (and why it didn't get resurrected in the post 9/11 world over Paul McCartney's lame song is beyond me) and ""Red Roses on White Lace"" ends the album on a solid note. This was close, but not quite enough, and MCA dropped him after this album.The best tracks from this album and ""Constrictor"" are available on the ""Prince Of Darkness"" compilation. A word to the wise should suffice."
3,This album is eerie!!!,"This cd is a definite improvement over Constrictor, with more improved songwriting and tighter songs. They almost go back to his old days of shocking people, including the last three songs, ""Chop, Chop, Chop, Gail, and Roses on White Lace"" almost play like a triple bill at a drive-in!"
3,Worth Owning For The Last 3 Songs,"Cooper continues down the 80's hair metal path with Kane Roberts and Kip Winger as his cohorts. To me this is a step down from ""Constrictor"" and 2/3rds of the album is very average anathematic hair metal. There are a few reasons to own the album however. The opening track ""Freedom"" was Alice's answer to Tipper Gore's PMRC. It is a bit on the corny rah rah side, but not a bad song. ""Prince Of Darkness"" is from the movie of the same name in which Cooper had a small acting role. The really good stuff on this album though is the last 3 songs which run together as a trilogy. ""Chop Chop Chop"", ""Gail"" and ""Roses On White Lace"" return to Cooper's horror music roots. I have heard that this is supposed to be about Jack The Ripper which would fit the lyrics. Either way it is a fine group of tunes and ends the album on a high note. The rest of the album does not do a lot for me, but if you are a fan of 80's metal anthems with fist pumping choruses this album might be for you."
4,An underrated April Wine gem.,"This album was originally released in Canada in 1976. It contains a wonderful array of hard rock tunes and some beautiful ballads. It is a wonderful showcase of the vocal talents of lead singer Myles Goodwyn. The highlights of this cd are 'Like a Lover Like a Song', 'Wings of Love', and 'Rock and Roll Woman'. I rate this as one of April Wines finest. A must have."
5,Shotdown,"I am a great fan of April Wine for 20 years. There was the other version of this album on LP, which contains beautiful ballads ""Marjorie"" and ""Child's Garden"" which also appear on their album ""Forever For Now"", and that version was perfect and my favorite April Wine album. Still, this version is excellent and contain string of great tunes. It is a wonder to me why any of April Wine compilations do not contain the classic ""Shotdown"". This is one of my most favorite AW song!"
1,frank marino on one tune-the rest stinks.,"for those robin trower/jimi hendrix/randy hanson fans, ""so bad"" features none other than fellow candian franke marino(as he spelled it back then). it rocks, it's awsome, its like a cut lifted fm a mahagony rush album. i'd probably pay the 25.00 just to hear that song again. wicked!"
1,Poor Quality,"I was excited to see that it arrived three days prior to the expected delivery date but when I opened the box and pulled the product out the straps riped away from the body! Please note that I did NOT pull or yank it out of the box, it came out very easily. I could sew them back in but I think it will just rip again. The stitching is also coming apart across the top of one of the floaties, in the middle. I was very excited when I ordered this for my 22 month old and am now very dissapointed that I'll have to send it back. Very dissapointed. Maybe it was just the one I got because none of the other reviews have negative comments about construction. Mine was a lemon, that's for sure."
1,Didn't last through the summer,I bought this for my son to help teaching him to swim. The shoulder strap came apart and made it unsafe. It only lasted 2 months going swimming only 4 times.
3,works well on a bigger kid,"I got this for my then 18 month old son so we can use it at the pool. I feel like he was still too small for it, not that he will be 2.5 I think we will use it a lot more. Our friends' kids use it al the time, they are 5 and 3, and it seems to work for them, that is why we got it."
4,Great Illustrations,"The best part of this book is the illustrations of the pictorial quilts. Each illustration has a description of the technique used, with arrows pointing to specifc areas being discussed. I don't think a beginner level quilter would be able to read this book and then go out and make a pictorial quilt, but it does provide a lot of great tips and techniques for a quilter with some experience. The book briefly covers many topics. For example, there are 2 pages on choosing colors for pictorial quilts, when there are entire books devoted to choosing colors. So each topic ends up being broadly defined, but clear examples (and pictures!) are given. Overall I enjoyed the book and am looking forward to making my first pictorial quilt!"
1,Not worth it!,"First of all, the description in Amazon, and every other Web site I looked on, does not tell you which ""various artists"" are on this CD. So being the true Dixie Chicks fan that I am, bought it anyway. What a waste of [money]. I still don't know who is singing on this CD! On the back it says something about ""This tribute record by rising young stars, the Nashville Girls of Country.."" I'm just completely turned off by that. I was hoping for some other well-known country stars or friends of the Dixie Chicks like Sheryl Crow or someone like that. Good luck if you are still interested."
1,Should be zero stars,"What is this CD? Awful, that's what. The album consists of terrible cover after terrible cover of some of the Dixie Chicks' best songs. It sounds less like a ""tribute"" and more like a group of [singers] trying to capitalize on Dixie Chicks' success by vaguely labelling their album in the hopes that someone will buy it under the impression that it contains some music that is anywhere near the Chicks' caliber. Don't waste your time. All the songs are taken under tempo and sung as if the lyrics were being read off a bouncing-ball karaoke screen. What makes the Chicks so great is the vivacity that is present in all of their songs, a vivacity that this ""tribute"" album sorely lacks. If you want to hear Dixie Chicks music, buy one of their albums, for God's sake. This is one tribute we could all have done without."
1,Scratching nails on a chalkboard -and that is a compliment!,"I love the Chicks ... if you love them, buy this CD and burn it, take the ashes and microwave them, take the goo that is left over and flush it ... and pray that an alligator swallows it and then chokes to death on it!This is the worst CD that was ever produced, short of anything that William Shatner ever sang ... (my apologies to my fellow Canadian for saying that, too!)This is an insult to any ear drums that are on the planet ... if there was a minus 5000 stars, I would give it ... it is an insult to the Chicks ... lord have mercy!"
1,Absolutely Horrible,"Don't buy this CD. I wasn't paying attention and thought this was a collection of Dixie Chick music by the Dixie Chicks. Instead, it is a messy attempt by unknown singers to emulate the Chicks. They fail miserably. If you want Dixie Chicks music buy Dixie Chicks albums."
5,Top Notch Product,I purchase this product for my cheer squad as a banquet gift. They were very excited and wished we could of gotten it a lot sooner. I am so glad I made this purchase even though it was late in the season. Good thing we made it to the playoffs because they got a chance to show them off and everybody wanted one.
3,"Fun theme, but plays a little ""eh""",It's really just a lot of dice rolling and luck. The pieces are nice plastic and the theme of monsters rampaging the country is fun...but it just doesn't make for a fun play.
1,"Best Impressions: How to Gain Professionalism, Promotion and",I was very disappointed in this book. The information can be found in lots of magazines - nothing new.
5,berceuse,A fine selection of beautiful music from bygone era's but music that will never die or be lost. People who love good music will always have a full appreciation of the classics.I highly recommend the CD
2,Interesting for it's length...,but quite often the asides in the book appear to be what is found on the internet.Many of the entries for director and sometimes actors are incorrect. This makes the cross referencing mentioned above useless.
3,Strangely lacking,"Though I find the usual Videohound a good referance guide, that cannot be said of this book. Their selection process of what to include seems at best enigmatic and the reviews are often confusing and some down right misleading. I find the book oddly lacking as a guide to Asian cinema purhaps more so given the self-imposed limitation of scope."
3,Paying for the name,"You are paying a premium for the Bosch name. Also, their customer service is terrible - you can only call weekdays, and expect to wait on hold for 20 minutes before you can talk to someone. At this price, they should fly the corporate CEO out to your home if you have a question.Pep Boys sells their in-house brand of oxygen sensor for a little over $2.5 billion, and it is just as good as the Bosch. Plus, if you have any problems with it, the store staff are all extremely helpful and knowledgeable, and if it stops working, they will exchange it for a new one with no questions asked. But if it's important to you to have a sensor with the Bosch logo on it, be my guest!"
2,Only worth half the asking price,"I figured the sensor, being a bit over $3 Billion, and being discounted about 17% would be a great deal. Installed it in my car, hooked it up to a live-time scanner, and I didn't get any better gas mileage. I was hoping for a good 100%."
5,a valuable investment guide,"I found this book to be clearly written, well organized, and very informative. Mr. Fishbine thoroughly explains complex technological issues in down-to-earth, and at times, humorous terminology that anyone can easily relate to. I would recommend this book as a valuable guide to anyone who is seriously thinking about investing in nanotechnology."
1,beware atlona,"Beware Atlona customer support and cables.These Atlona cables work fine if you get the right ones from Atlona, I ordered some, what came was a generic VGA, after about 10 emails and several phone calls, Atlona Technologies finally told me they were on back order, (even though they make the cables there in San Jose) They said it would be a couple weeks, but the cable they sent should work, it could not even carry a signal 12 feet,They finally admitted it was a cheap generic and should not have been sent.They promised to send a new Atlona cable, but it has been 5 weeks and no cable. At one time they were a good company with good customer support,but have since gone down hill with my past three orders."
3,"Too expensive, and depends upon the teacher.","Although I applaud Kay's intentions in presenting geometry in this fashion, I think that this book would require an excellent teacher to accompany it. In some ways, I might have predicted this, because to preserve the ""discovery,"" you have to be a little coy about what you are trying to teach...you have to hide the point. The book would be an excellent reference text, as Kay provides the historical context of most of the theorems, and the material is presented in a rather dense format."
2,Not easy reading,I read this text line by line and still needed a good teacher and research on the web ...and I like math. If you have the choice try a different text.
2,No easy way around this subject...,"I guess there really is no good way to approach geometric proofs in college. No matter how you look at it, they are rough. But, I tend to be a positive person, and I feel that there has to be a better way of describing college geometry compared to this book. It's very dry, and even if you read the text line by line, you're bound to get lost. It doesn't help that I don't have a very good professor for this class, but nonetheless, I'm still not very satisfied with the overall layout of this book."
2,"Good Condition, Horrible textbook","This textbook was horrible. I am a math major, and am good at math. I also love math, and this book was so difficult to understand and so hard to use. Not to mention, the answer section doesn't show any work to help find the answers. Overall, I would not recommend this book at all!"
3,A Consultant's Selling Tool,"I would not call this a handbook; because a handbook is in my opinion supposed to fully educate you on how to complete a project. This book does supply information, but in a way that the reader is left with more questions and this is where Supply Chain Excellence, owned by Peter Bolstoff, a consulting firm looks to obtain new business. Also this book pushes you to think you need ProccessWizard, which is not true, most of what is in it, that I have found, you can build yourself or use Microsoft's Visio software.But if you have knowledge of Supply Chain Performance and an understanding of Lean Manufacturing and six sigma you can fill in the gaps without having to invite SCE to clear up your confusion."
3,SCOR methodology explained,"This book does a decent job of explaining SCOR methodology to the novices. Please do not expect to immideately start using the SCOR model after reading this book - that needs a lot of experience and judgement. Besides the slightly dry writing style, I do not have quibbles with the style. On the content side - I do believe the title promises more that what it will deliver to most people."
2,More of a how than a what book,"I purchased this book to better understand the SCOR (Supply Chain Operations Reference) model. I started to read the book cover to cover, but stopped to scan the book after chapter 3. The book is basically a project plan and a case study for implementing Supply Chain Operations. I found very little to educate the novice in the details of SCOR. As for the ""how"" approach, any good project manager would be able to come up with a project plan as described within the book. If you already understand SCOR and want an off the shelf project plan, then this book may be helpful. However, I did not find it very useful in understanding the underlying processes."
3,A good book for me as a reference,This book is available for me as a reference in my task as senior purchasing to conduct best parctical of supply chain
3,A consultants view,This author gives a fine view of supply chain from the consultants point of view.
2,Doesn't add anything to previous books,"Perhaps if I had not read so many lesbian fiction stories before, this book would have been more fulfilling. The writing is crisp, the plot satisfying and the characters mostly believable. I have read many variations on this theme before; unfortunately, this work does not add any quirk, twist or uniqueness to what I have already read. If you are new to this genre, the book is a good initiation to the field. The only reason to read it if you are a lesbian fiction junkie is to fill out the complete works category."
3,Freak,Doing Anything tonight is the best. A cross between Hip Hop and dance hall style music. It could definately pack a dance floor. It sounds as if the Artists were having fun and a party while recording it. A must have
4,Brilliant is their shine,"Finally, an album which attempts to capture the other-worldly experience of seeing Iona live. ""Heaven's Bright Sun"" accomplishes this awesome feat with near perfection. The album is rich with the musical stylings Iona has embraced throughout their history, but, alas, as with any live project, they failed to include some of my favorites. The other rave reviews here are accurate, but I'd like to pick on two points: Joann's vocal falters several times throughout the album...I wish they could have used a track recorded on a better night. Second, I've heard much better treatments of ""Chi-Rho"" (one of my favorites). All in all, a smashing album. ""Reels"" and ""Apple"" are new favorites."
5,A bright spot in music - refreshingly differen't,Iona is one of the most creative and inovative bands today! Their message is challanging and their musicality is second to none. 2 thumbs up.....way up!
1,Worthless trash,"The item arrived fine and intact, but upon opening the box I found myself staring at what I can only assume is someone's sick and twisted joke. I spent 45 minutes trying to ""assemble"" the rack, with the side pegs falling out on me every time I tried to put another piece in place. I finally got down to the bottom and the last side and noticed the piece meant for the bottom is curved in a way that makes it impossible to put in place. I'd attempt to bend it straight but it seems about as brittle as dead tree bark. I finally just figured with a bottom that brittle it would be all of a week before it was broken anyway and threw it in the trash, which is where it belongs I feel."
5,A Classic in 80's Electronica,You don't have to be a fan of Miami Vice to enjoy this classic example of 1980's Electronica music. The score really captures the feel of Miami in the 80's and the clash of cultures starting to grow there at the time.
2,Lots of noise,"During playback, the CD has a lot of noise. To make sure, I played the CD on several CD players. Each player had the same noise. I would recommend not getting this CD. The quality of the CD sucks. This will be one that will be donated off to Goodwill."
4,World War 2,"Actual World War 2 film, showing how it was back then. If YOU like to go back to World War 2, this is a MUST see. I have been to Poland and visited Auschwitz Contraction Camp a few years back, stayed in Krakow Poland. This just brought my trip back, but in the WW2 years."
2,Dissapointed.,"As Holocaust films go, this one was probably the least informative. Film footage taken by a Russian film crew after the camps were liberated. I planning to purchase the rest of the series, but after viewing this first one, will not be getting any more and will probably sell the one I've got."
3,"Good, but the usual stuff","It's an OK documentary but it delivers up the usual fare, not a lot of stuff you havn't already seen."
3,Not what I expected,"This is simply an informational DVD. There is not music behind it, there is no history to learn as to the reasons of the holocaust and it became rather boring."
3,Wonderful,"It's lovely. The art style isn't for everyone since it's more Korean than Japanese, but I love it. It's very off the wall and odd at first, so it's either you love it or you hate it, but I like the story. It's interesting and has kept me enamoured enough to buy my own copies and wait with baited breath for the next release. I definitely recommend it if you like magic, pretty boys, shounen-ai, or gothic romance."
4,Very Touching,"This story is of a young girl, the age of 13, who is told she has leukemia. This story tells of the struggles that Dawn has to face with having this illness with being in the hospital and taking many different Chemotherapy medications. It also tells of her friendship with another cancer paitent named Sandy. They quickly become best friends drawn together by their illness. This story is very touching and makes you think very hard about your life, and how it could be."
5,Touching And Sincere,This Book is a wondorous book full of hope and reality. I enjoyed so much that I have since the read it again Lurleen Mc Daniel is Sensational.
5,Six Months to Live,"Six Months to Live was an amazing book. It was sad, because the main character (Dawn Rochelle) is diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia. I liked almost everything about it. It was very well written. It wasn't a really long book, but it wasn't exactly short, either. It's the first book in the Dawn Rochelle series. The only thing I didn't really like was that it was depressing. Dawn kept getting better with her cancer, but her best friend Sandy (who was her room mate in the hospital) has a relapse. Then, Sandy's Dad sends her to Mexico so she can receive treatments there. All she had to take was some sort of pills. But then, Dawn got a telegram from Sandy's family, saying that Sandy died. It was just really sad, because Lurlene McDaniel made it seem so real. I could almost feel Dawn's emotional pain when she found out that Sandy had passed away. Lurlene McDaniel really is an amazing author, and I would recommend her books to anyone."
1,terrable!,"this book is very wronge in discribing a real 13 year old girl. its a mixed up mess involving a chidish girl (she acts like she's 7) who ""meets a bff"" in the in the hospital and the book drones on and about how they over came cancer and even though it was hard, the world is all happy and full of teady bears! i couldn't even finish it, it was so bad!"
4,Six Months To LIve,"This book is about a 13 year old girl named Dawn Rochelle and her life with leukemia. She had never been sick in her life then one day Dawn went to the doctor and she said, ""You have leukimia."" It is a form of cancer. Dawn was very scared. While at the hospital Dawn met another girl about her age who had leukemia, they became best friends. Her friends name was Sandy.They joined cancer camp together were all the kids had cancer. Dawn and Sandy met two guys named Greg and Mike.The doctor gave Dawn some drugs to take, she lost her hair and lost a lot of weight.One day her friend Sandy was really sick and then she died.Dawn had a wonderful will to live."
3,Six Months To Live,This book is about a little girl who is 15 years old. She is going through Leukamia and is losing all of her hair. She has been in the hospital for the past six months and missed a lot of school. All of her friends send her cards from school and some of them come in to visit her. When she is in the hospital for awhile she is finally not alone. Another girl comes in with the same problem and the same age. They become roomates. I think this is an interesting book. It shows a lot of teens how lucky they really have it. In some parts it is sad but in other parts it's a good kind of sad. This book makes you feel like you are actually in the book with the characters.
2,Six Months To Live,"I found this book to be one of Lurlene McDaniel's worse but it's still enjoyable. I know this author had a rough time, what with her son being sick but I don't think she takes a promblem very well. It may just be that i don't like Dawn that ruined this book for me, but all McDaniel's books that I've read brought a tear to my eye exept this one. I couldn't feel sympathy for this character. It's well written as far as depressing books go but I can't say it's my favorite."
1,"Hint, hint: Someone's going to die!","My sister had this book, and I read it because I was bored. It followed the same format as all this author's other books (based on what my sister's told me). It's kind of annoying. Despite the title, this girl lives through four books! I can see why girls would like this book since it deals with disease, but personally I like carnage and destruction better. I'll take a good explosion over an inner-body disease any day. I've read worse, but this certainly wasn't the best.Joel, grade 8"
5,Two Masters of the Guitar,"The relationship between Segovia and Ponce was similar to the one between von Karajan and Richard Strauss or Samuel Barber and John Browning or even Bach and Glenn Gould - kindred souls interpreting music for which they have an especial affinity. This collection reminds me of Eugene Ysaye's set of violin sonatas - each dedicated to a particular musician and reminiscent of the artist's style.The three seem to have a ""program"" of sorts from the first one (""Homage a Fr. Schubert"") to the magnificent SONATA CLASICA dedicated to the memory of Sor to the last one which is a salute to his native country. Segovia gives a broad and enthusiastic interpretation, making the music dance, blend and soar. Some of the technical difficulties seems to demand too much from one set of hands. Add this to your collection NOW."
4,Good handbook,"This handbook is a collection of essay's on various issues of christian spiritual formation & discipleship. I had this as a text at Lee University for my Spiritual Formation & Discipleship class, and largely enjoyed it. There is nothing I'd consider ""great"" in this book, however, there are a few good articles that are informative for those who wish to gain a good understanding of many issues today, with a nice bibliography that can lead to further research."
1,"Poor Quality, openings clipped","I purchased this hoping the Police videos would be complete (the endings are clipped in the US release) and to my dismay the openings of the videos are chyronned out with the title. The transfers were inferior as well, looks like worn out VHS. Stick the the US domestic release."
1,Another under-delivered promise,"Well, may be it's just my over-expectations :)Seriously - I am still chopping vegetables manually.This thing is good to make a mess or puree of anything you have.You can use it sometimes if you cook for yourself only and don't mind the look of results, although even in this case you will arguably spend more time cleaning the chopper.So, honestly, you don't want this. Buy a good knife or a grater."
1,Norpro Stainless Steel Jumbo Capacity Chopper,"I purchased this chopper because it was oversized and stainless steel. The chopper is hard to get apart once you've used it and the chopping action isn't good at all. My previous chopper was a Zyliss and I wish I had gone with another of that brand. The one nice feature, if you can put up with all the bad, is that it doesn't warp in the dishwasher. Unfortunately, my experience with this chopper wasn't a good one and I should have returned it while I could."
1,Wish I never bought it.,"Wish I never bought it. Vegetables get stuck to the inside of the blades, plus its difficult to clean the chopper. I say stick to knives and cutting boards, or find a better chopper."
2,what in the hell...,i am a huge aaliyah fan i was hurt that they would ruin her songs lyke that... i gave it 2 stars only because it was a tribute to aaliyah... and whoever was singin needs to be taken out of her misery... not only did she was tone deaf but even i could hit better notes then that... an im not a singer... she should be ashamed of herself... and whoever told her she could sing they need to give up the ghost... its nice they wanted to give aaliyah a tribute but people do it with class and let it something she could be proud of... next time that label thinks about giving somone a tribute they need to be sure that singer is far away and out of the studio... they could of had a chance but any chance they had was blown by those terrible vocals...
1,What a shame,"What a shame indeed...A pathetic attempt 2 do her and her songs justice. A totall discrace. Should have left them well alone if u ask me, after all u cant out do perfection. Credit where credits due though, the recognition of the excelence of Aaliyahs work absolutely deserves tribute, however its just a shame it nowhere near even scratches the serfice. It was a hard job, impossible some might say, best left untouched.Like herself, untouchable."
1,What..,Why in the world did whoever put this album out do this. They should be sued. They should have stuck to singing in there basement. It is an insult to Aaliyah's beautiful and talented voice. I just don't understand why they would do it...my advice to anyone thinking of buying the album Don't at least pls listen to the sample before doing so. That is what I did and that is what made me not buy it...Can you say I would give it a negative 5 stars...Only choose one star because i could not print this review if i did not...
1,You call this a tribute?,"I cannot believe they let some no name people redo Aaliyah's songs. They should have kept it with Aaliyah's voice. She was a beautiful and talented young lady and deserved a better tribute. This just sounds like a way for these no name artists to get their 15 minute fame!! Well, they [are bad]! Nobody should buy this CD. Review it first! You'll agree with the rest of us when we say this CD is not worth buying!"
1,Saddened Fan,"Aaiyah came to our planet with a purpose.... She made those lives of fans happy with her talent, her mistique and her beauty. People who over-ride her with their unfair and disgusting phoney compositions deserve to be sued. This CD is an insult to a person who was so talented and had such a short life. If Aaliyah knew about this I am sure she would feel the same way."
1,What in the hell!,Who in the hell in their right mind would insult the most beautiful and talented african Queen of all time. the only thing we have of her is her music and someone just come right alone and insulted AALIYAH'S gift. This CD is very wack and it dosen't need to come out on the shelves. I got just one request. Please tell whom ever the girl is that I came give her free vocal lessons because her voice is a disgraced!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,This is no tribute...,...It's a mistake. It's just a compilatation of Aaliyah's songs re-sung by unknown artists. No thought or originality was put into the production. Nothing new or interesting is offered. This cd just made me long for the real deal. Save your money.
2,DON'T get this cd,"I don't know what these people are trying to prove,but they sure prove to me they'll never become big time singers!This album doesn't even deserve Aaliyah's name attached to the project!Aaliyah's label,Blackground Records,didn't even produce this album.It was some rinky-dink label,Big Eye Music.If Black ground did produce this album,I know it would be 3 out of 4 times better!Don't buy this album!Save your money!Aaliyah's got a new album out anyway!I LOVE the song ""Miss You""!And the only reason I didn't give this CD 1 star is because it's a tribute album!"
1,Im Sorry For Aaliyah,"Ok, Aaliyah had talent, she spent her whole life showing us that talent and we appreciate it, very much. So why have some idiots produced this knock-off cd insulting Aaliyah's memory? This is no tribute but a cheap way of making money. Aaliyah, if u could see this then, I apologise that your memory has been dented with this pathetic excuse for a ""tribte album"". The original versions to all these songs are fawless, just like Aaliyah herself. She defined the word beauty, please let's not have another incident like this ""tribute CD"", if there is a tribute to her it should be sincere and genuine. R.I.P Baby Girl!"
1,THOROUGHLY DISIZGUZTED!!!! NO STARS PERIOD!,"Look, who told that chic she could sing?!!!! Dang man, if you are going to try to give an incredbily gifted artist, ANGEL, like AALIYAH a tribute, at least get some peeps that can sing! I mean dang...This isn't a tribute, this is a disgrace! Somebody find the person who did this and make sure they never pick up a mic again, God! This isn't karaoke night at a club. AALIYAH, we love you, and your TRUE fans will keep you alive--this cd just needs to go under a rock some place deep in Australia and never resurface, ever!"
1,What a joke!,I am the biggest Aaliyah fan and they coulda done alot better on this. it sounded nothing like aaliyah!
1,complete rubbish,"I am an Aaliyah fan and have all her material but this so called ""Tribute CD"" is terrible... If the ""performers"" were legit no record company would give them the time of day yet alone send this to print...I wouldn't waste my money on this rubbish... it's almost like they aare spitting on her grave and making a mockery of her music and life....I only gave it one star because I have to.. and it's not even worth that!"
1,Good Grief Charlie Brown!,"Oh my goodness! What kinda tribute is this? This sounds like a bad karaoke cd! Whoever made up this ""tribute"" owes Aaliyah fans a big apology. They were better off just making a mix tape using her own songs, in her own voice. This was a very bad way to pay tribute to such a talented young star, who died so tragically. This cd is TERRIBLE! Big time! I don't even like giving it 1 star. It doesn't even deserve 1/100 of a star. This is the worst cd ever! Good grief Charlie Brown!"
1,Don't buy it,This is what you should do if you want a real tribute to Aaliyah buy her original cds because this just ain't right making a remake of aaliyah cd to this. It is jakked up.I'm Aaliyah biggest fan I should know so you relly really shounldn't buy it.
1,"Aaliyah Tribute Cd i have one word for this Cd ""why""","I'm a big fan of Aaliyah and I must say if you producers and writters are not going to make A tribute worth buying, please start a new career I tired of you guys ripping Aaliyah's stuff off making her name look bad. If she seen what you people have done in tribute for her she would role over in her grave. If your trying to make money off of peoples stuff at lest put the time and effert into the product so people would want to buy it, the movie Losing Aaliyah was bootleg and this Tribute CD is beleive me not what people are waiting for. I'm starting to think that these tributes are becoming hopeless. I hope timberland will make something nice for Aaliyah tribution and soon! I love you Aaliyah R.I.P"
1,What?,They could have at least made it sound like Aaliyah singing. It's not a very good interpretation of her. It could have been much better.
1,Shameful,"Just from simply listening to the samples i know this album is lame. It sounds like they got someone's grandma to try to remake these songs. They could have at least gotten popular artist to remake the songs since its a TRIBUTE. This is just another ploy to use this woman's death to make money i.e. the promotion of Queen of the Damned. This is a good album to have if you want to get a good laugh otherwise, it's jus [sad]."
2,Could have done better myself!,"I gave this tribute two stars and only because the songs are Aaliyah remakes. Why weren't there people singing these songs that could actually sing? Why don't these songs have music that sounds like the original? I feel as if I could have done this project in my home basement with a karaoke machine. One thing I do like about the CD is the tracks that were used. It was a good choice of songs. Actually they used almost all of my favorites. However, anyone planning on getting this CD, keep your money. From what I know, this project is not suppported by Aaliyah's record company or any of those close to her. Hardcore Aaliyah fans, just wait, cause word has it that Blackground(her company) is releasing a greatest hits CD. Waiting patiently with ya'll, remember babygirl truly was ""One In A Million""."
1,Insulting,"They Took Songs That Aaliyah Sung Pefectly And Ruined Them With Singers That Don't Come Close, This Isn't A Tribute, It's A Remake Of Aaliyah's Songs Using Other Singers. At Least With Aaliyah's CDs We Hear Bably Girl Sing Her Songs, I Mean Who Wants To Hear Someone Else Sing Them???Bottom Line - Waste Of Money And Insulting To Her Memory."
1,What the H-E- Double...,"I didn't know this cd existed until just now, and now I see why! This is horrible! The vocals, the production, and they don't even get the words right! How could they do something like this! If Aaliyah wasn't resting right now, I would've had a good laugh and went on about my business, I wouldn't have even bothered w/ the review ... but this is TERRIBLE! If they're not gonna do it right, then they shouldn't do it at all. Let her rest in peace! Listen to the samples... but I'm warning you, It's gonna hurt! Now I'm gonna go pick up the REAL AALIYAH's cd and try to forget this nightmare ever happened!!"
1,A work of absolute [...]!!,"This album is a disgrace!! You don't have non-talented singers contribute to Aaliyah like that! I was so [mad], those singers did not do her justice. Come On People!! We all know as fans of Aaliyah that she deserves better than that!! I think Missy, Timb, and everyone else that was close to her would feel the same. Don't even waste your money on this piece of [junk]! It sounds more like a karyoke type thing going on. Who ever was singing those songs- i hope you didn't quit your day job because you [stin]k big time!!"
1,Bad CD,"This cd is the worst cd ever made I could have done better with a tape recorder. it shouldn't be called a tribute to aaliyah but a mockery of aaliyah.If you want to hear the songs that weren't sung by rejects than I suggest to skip that cd and buy the ones she sung. Example:when I first heard ""at your best"" on another website I loved that song but when my friend let me see her a tribute to aaliyah cd and somebody else was singing it she sang it in a much deeper voice. I hope they learn from this mistake"
1,what a cheap and tacky way to cash in on a tragedy!!!!!!!,"This is wrong on so many levels that I can't even begin to explain. This is in NO way a tribute to Aaliyah. I find this to be in very poor taste and demeaning to Aaliyah's work. She deserves much better than this. The people who sing her songs need to go back to their kennels immediatley if not soon. So, you want to know what my recommendation is, save your money or just buy Aaliyah's albums if you want to hear true talent."
1,Wa?,"Is that what ppl call a Tribute? give me a break...is the so called ""tribute album"" was suppose to some way to replace AALIYAH?soory, but really really keep your money, even if u are a collector...i give one star cos of it album cover, no more.... no more..."
1,What is this?,I don't understand. One would have to laugh to keep from crying over what is supposed to be a tribute to the late Aaliayh Haughton. This album was thrown together with absolutely no effort at all. I would tell the creators of this CD to put the FisherPrice keyboard back up on the shelf.
1,What a SHAME!!!,"All I did was listen to the samples of this CD (does it really deserve to be called that?) because I have better things to spend my money on. I think a tribute CD would be best done by arist of Blackground and Rockafella (sp). All of the tributes to Aaliyah have been totally disrespectful of Aaliyah Dana Haughton. You want to make a tribute to Aaliyah? Make her movie ""Queen of the Damned"" a success.Needless to say, this CD is TERRIBLE! If Aaliyah's family wanted to sue the producers of this CD I think it would be good riddance!I feel very strongly about my opinion. I had no problem putting my REAL NAME at the top. Save your money for her CD that is supposed to come out in August. Thank you for reading this"
1,A disgrace,"This CD [stinks]! I just listened to the clips on amazon, and the lady singing sounds like she doesn't even have an R and B background.Such disrespect to a beautiful singer."
3,This is a Tribute?,"Hello, my name is Kisha. I'm a new customer of Amazon.com and a longtime fan of Aaliyah's. I have every CD released by Aaliyah and have seen most of her appearances on TV. I have always believed that her voice and style was definitely one of a kind. I was proven right when I heard this poor excuse of a CD. This CD was the worse tribute I've ever heard. On my Grade scale this CD deserves an 'F-'."
1,A Warning,"Just so you know, there are many CDs out there entitled ""A Tribute to..."" insert artist's name. I think this was just bad timing. I bought ""A Tribute to *NSYNC"" CD, but I knew what I was getting: a bunch of bootleg artists trying to sing some *NSYNC songs. This is definitely not something you'd want to buy if you're serious."
1,What were you thinking?,"If you wanted to make a Aaliyah Tribute Cd, you should have just taken her best songs and put it on a Cd, but instead you had some other gurl singing. I know I writing this review like I'm talking to the guy who made this cd but buyer beware!!!!!"
1,Why dont you just buy HER cd?,"I think that this cd could have been better. You would be way better to just buy the real cd. It is sad that she passed but, they can do better"
1,AWFUL!!!!,"Personally, there was no use to have a tribute like this. People can enjoy the same songs sung by Aaliyah herself from her own albums. I also feel that the people on there could not sing or sound like Aaliyah at all. The background music of all the songs seemed to be different than the original songs'. Being a great fan of Aaliyah, it was a waste of money for me to buy this. Secondly, a substantial number of people agree that this tribute is a complete flop and an insult to Aaliyah herself. Rest in peace Aaliyah. You will always be in our hearts!"
1,Not EVEN worth sampling!!,"I didn't even buy this cd, just sampled it. It doesn't even begin to compare with the original recordings of Aaliyah's songs. The most revolting and disgusting covers are ""Journey To THe Past"" ""Are You That Somebody"" and ""We Need A Resolution"", which not only needs it's own resolution, but a complete makeover. The only track on here that doesn't disgrace the incomparable artist is the cover of ""More Than A Woman"". Don't waste your time even listening to the samples. Just go listen to an original Aaliyah song."
1,This is an ABOMINATION!!!,"Excuse me, but this is the babygirl that we are dealing with here...why does this sound like Dolly Parton's niece's reject demo to the Grand Ole' Opry?! I can understand the music not being on point, but the voice on top of the music...come on STOP THE MADNESS and keep your bootlegg tribute to yourself!!! True Aaliyah fans would very much appreciate that. Rest In Peace Babygirl, you and only you are One In A Million. We love you and miss you dearly! ATTN: Please support Aaliyah and buy her true albums if you have not already. Peace, Ms. Ghee, SPG; inc.."
1,this is a disgrace to her music,"Aaliyah was on her way to superstardom, but now that she is gone people try to make a profit off of her. this so-called tribute is not a tribute at all. it's just her songs that somebody completely ruined. They even ruined timbaland's beats. i would not buy this album if my life depended on it. if someone else trys to do this at least get someone who can sing. I sing better than the person on this cd! THIS CD DESERVES NO STARS BUT I AM FORCED TO GIVE IT ONE TO LET MY REVIEW BE SEEN."
1,A Tribute...That's not it.,"This is a sad excuse for any type of album, but most of all a tribute. First off the songs are supposed to be performed by ""Various Artists"" there is only one ""vocalist"" and she sounds bad. I am completely disappointed. Granted Aaliyah wasn't the best vocalist herself, but at least she could carry a tune. This woman sounds tone deaf. She has no style, no delivery, face it she has no talent (at least not for singing). The only reason I would by this would be to make me laugh when I'm depressed."
1,Tribute My A**,"I'm Sick of all these ""TRIBUTE TO"" albums. It just features a bunch of wanna be singers trying to sing other musicians music. For any Aaliyah fan, Buy her real albums, not these fake ones, RIP"
4,Great Wedding CD,I was alittle skeptical before I bought this as to whether it would be the right kind of music I wanted at my wedding or not. But I will have to say I really enjoyed it after I got it and I am definately going to be using it at my wedding.
4,wedding cs,this is one of them cds you only listen to one time and thats for the wedding well that's what i did work great thanks
5,This CD was exactly what I was looking for for my wedding!!!,This CD is awesome!!! Even my now husband who hates classical music enjoied it on our wedding day. Even now we listen to it in those quiet special moments. Excellent CD!!! I am so glad I found it!!!! Thank you so much!!!!
2,Dull company,"The music is lovely. However, for the purpose of a wedding, I found the combination uninspiring and lacking in excitement. Best suited for way in the background music for dining. A disappointment."
4,Wedding Coordinator Tool,Very good CD to use for weddings - especially during rehersals. Good variety of songs to use.
3,Just OK,"I listen to a lot of classical music so it was important to me that I find the perfect classical music CD for my wedding.I thought this CD was OK but I found another CD on [Amazon.com] that was much better.Its called ""Classical Wedding Traditions""This CD had the best Classical sound I have heard yet...."
5,Great For Outdoor Weddings,"I had my wedding outside, in a large gazebo, but did not havethe funds to hire a musican to play traditional wedding songs at my ceremony. I also wanted the traditional ""Here Comes The Bride"" with out worring how it would sound for certain instruments. 'Classical Wedding' was WONDERFUL alternative and made my outdoor garden wedding spectacular!"
3,A Nice CD,"This is a nice CDIt gave us some good ideas.However the one we used at the wedding was""Classical Wedding Traditions"" (on amazon.com)This CD gave us a better overall sound and selection.We also found on amazon.com the ""New Wedding Traditions Volume I"" CD for our father/bride and mother/groom songs."
4,wedding music,This CD contains a smattering of all the traditional pieces you would expect to be played during a wedding ceremony which is why I purchased it. I do like it and it will be used at my ceremony. I prefer a little more big orchestral sound but this will do nicely.
5,Traditional and wonderful,"I bought this CD for my ballet classes and am really happy with it. It has all of the classics, and each is very true to it's original composition. There are a lot of horns, which are not my favorite, but the strings make it worth every penny!"
1,Time of Year,"This guy has an absolutely amazing voice, however he is wasting it on this group of untalented musicians. This album is boring and repetitive, and fails to stand out from any of the new rock groups. The one great song this group had is titled ""Time of Year."" Good Luck finding it. But make sure you give it a listen; it makes you wonder how great the singer could be with a better band behind him."
1,stupid,"Monumentally stupid documentary that tries to imagine third world countries and Europe without the influence of the American Empire - and fails to mention 9/11.9/11 is the key to the entire question of America's domination of as many countries as possible, in he Middle East and elsewhere.Don't waste 90 minutes of your time on this."
4,"Good, but really short","Ending of this (by nuclear bomb) seems propagandistic and using too much fear undermine quality of this document.Also I was surprised, when in Bosnia case author didnt mention Tudjman-Milosevic contract and tell that bosnians were muslims, serbs orthodox, but doesnt mention catholic croatians which takes also part in this war.And China was little bid demonized.On the second hand I like that part about middle east, especially focus on the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait (which many people seems to forgot) and mentioning, that Sadam offered cheaper oil to the US.It is not really detailed, but I know that, when I was buying this. Its more like introductiomn to this question.My rating is something between 3-4 stars, but I dont see much documentaries about this issue, so because of that I would like to rate this by 4 stars."
1,A stealth Neocon bit of Propoganda,The producer of this rationalization of US global military dominance is a very conservative Roman Catholic evangelizing organization called Deepwater productions. Check out their web site and view the DVD with LOTS of awareness of its strong bias.
3,Pretty interesting.,"Pretty interesting documentary. I actually helped shoot some scenes for it when production came to Cleveland, OH. I hope everyone can watch this documentary. It will help shed some light as to why we are fighting."
1,Very disappointing...,"Bad direction, very questionable choice of interviewees (who are those people?), sweeping statements and, best of it all, the documentary does not answer the question (""What would the world be without the US?""), oh yes sorry, actually it does : instantaneous nuclear holocaust...It awkwardly mixes (would-be) analysis and fiction (like the fake political campaign, or the last 5 minutes of the movie [Japan nuked by China])...To sum it up : clumsy and borring..."
3,Ruined the nostalgia effect,I was very excited when I found this copy of this movie because as a child this was one of my favorite movies to watch. I watched it on VHS of course and wanted a DVD version for my daughter. However when watching it with her I was extremely disappointed to find out that 2 songs were completely cut out and at least 2 others were cut short. The movie is not the same because of all the cuts and is not as enjoyable. I am quite upset with that...I am glad it did not cost me a whole lot. Though I am sick and tired of my childhood things being ruined by people redoing them or editing them just keep them how they were.
3,A Solid Effort!,"If you plan to use Nobody's Business But Your Own as a reference guide to starting your own business, stop now. Don't stop reading the book, but stop whatever plans you have about setting out on your own. Enroll in some classes. Talk with an entrepreneur or two. But to rely on this book for advice would mean falling back on lessons that most people should have absorbed simply from living to adulthood. This is not to say that the book doesn't offer general pointers about starting a business - it does. But even the least business-savvy readers will find the guidelines presented here much too simplistic to serve as any foundation for business strategy creation. However, if you enjoy hearing the real-life stories of successful entrepreneurs, by all means read this book. The true-life anecdotes that close each chapter are colorful and entertaining, and we [...] recommend this book to anyone interested in reading well-written tales of entrepreneurial accomplishment."
4,Loved the book!,I think that everyone from our generation will see themselves in Bob and Lara.Hope it gets some promotion - it deseves to be marketed to the over 80 million boomers that would love it!I'm going to read it again when my wife has finished.
1,A Complete Misrepresentation,This is NOT a 3 qt. tea kettle. It clearly says on the box 2 1/2 quarts. I returned it.
2,not useful,"For a book that has color in its title, it sure does not show it in its pages. There is only a meek use of color, and what use of color there is in the book, is in a limited range. The design style is outdated or poorly done traditional and country. I recommend you skip this book."
3,Walking in Memphis,I bought this soley for Walking In Memphis after listening to the rest of it I found out I liked more of Mr. Cohn's stuff than I thought. Very solid greatest hits album.
2,Marc Cohn music,"The CD plays fine but the case was destroyed when I got it. Also, it was suppossed to be a new item and it was not in it's original packaging. Pretty deceiving and the seller was not honest about it being new."
5,One of the best country artists of the 90's,"Skip Ewing is a great song writer and artist, his music from the 90's is still good today. It is a shame that he's not still making new stuff for his many fans, and that his existing stuff is no longer being made by the record labels."
5,mp3 downloads,Would love songs from this album be available for mp3 downloads.Some of the best work Skip ever did! Need to see more.
5,_Kathryn_: What a wonderful read!,"I just finished this book! It was one of the better books I have read in years. I did not buy it on Amazon, it was bought for me at a yard sale for a dime, so I got a deal!! I have never been one for romances period, but this book really made me think! What a great way to weave fiction into fact! This book is a must for the historical romance lover!!"
1,Original?,"It is no wonder that some readers believe that the experiences depicted in this collection are so vivid as to convey a sense of immediacy. The truth is that Ms. Lifshin's ""work"" is so derivative of the writings and comments previously brought to our attention by Claude Lanzmann and Robert Abzug as to border on ""outright borrowing."""
3,"Quick read, but doesn't live up to its potential","Muller's cookie-cutter plot line and characters attempt to reach Spenser or Mallone (""A"" is for Alibi, etc.) levels, but fall just short. Her characters seem to have been created directly from a ""how-to"" book on detective fiction, with not quite enough depth to true make them three dimensional. That said, the book is a nice, quick read. The perfect beach or airline book that will entertain but not challenge or entrance the reader. Muller has a lot of potential, but ""A Wild and Lonely Place"" only hints at her skills, rather than displaying them fully."
3,Not worth buying,"I think this book is not worth buying, because there are too many features that was just left off by the author, using always the same excuse: ""Well, this feature is not commonly used, so I won't disscuss it any further in this book"". Besides that, it gives you a big averall coverage of COM. If you want to go to the inners of COM, this book is not for you. It was not for me."
4,"Good book, needed book","This is a book that should have been written years ago. Gives all the major topics coverage. If you do any of this type of programming, it is invaluable."
4,Great book that takes you from A-Z,I thought this book gives the programmer all of the tools to write COM/DCOM apps. It is a must if you are planning to go with COM/Delphi. I still think that COM is safer than .NET at the present time. The only drawback with the book is that there is no way to contact the author and the code for the book cannot be downloaded from the web site shown on the back cover.
2,DCOM,"I find the book usefull for writing COM objects with delphi. This the only book I find at amazon writing COM objects with delphi. But I have a question about writing DCOM objects. At page 299 under the title ""Creating DCOM client"". The author says us to import DCOMServer.tlb type library. But I cannot find this on neither my machineor anywhere else. Is it a standart Type library? It will be very good if you ilimunate us for this. Thanks You."
4,"""The Ultimate Guide for a Newbie to Com Programming""","I've browsed the book and actually loved it so much that I spend 24hrs just coding...Delphi is simply Rad, gotta read this book all ya ""Newbies & off-course ya ""Old Programmers"""
4,A thorough overview of COM programming with Delphi,"A very interesting and worthwhile book, if you want to learn about Interfaces, COM programming, Type Librarys, DCom and all that stuff. It provides a good set of examples, and some very fine sample code, such as a type library viewer, which is almost worth the price of the book itself. Well worth a read if you want to integrate COM into your delphi apps."
5,Good,"Great olives. When you get them some will be smashed up a bit, but it doesn't really affect the flavor any."
3,"Tasty , but salty ... and seem not to last","This is a very nice mix of olives, relatively tasty. But, darn, are they salty! I really didn't expect so much salt for olives packed in oil, and I completely disagree with previous posters.I would not have purchased if I had tasted them first.Also, I've had them about three days -- in frig, sealed, per package instructions. And, I don't think they are going to last. I am already seeing white form on some olives. Yuck. Look to other posts mentioning a similar problem. To Amazon's credit, the refunded the purchase price."
2,what are those round things with stems?,olives would be good plain but the flavor is not very olive like with these spices and what are those miniature cucumber looking things with 2 inch stems?
5,great one-stop shop olive mix,"this a great product because you can have all your olives, caper berries,and red peppers all in one location. wonderful flavor and beautiful display."
2,Not what I had hoped for,I didn't like it plain and simple. Vocals and otherwise were simply unappealing.
1,not worth the money,"This is a prime example of Christian music being nothing but a sub-par copy of non-Christian music. The first few songs sounded somewhat interesting, but overall this album lacks any kind of originality or great display of musical talent. The songs bore me and I find myself wondering why I wasted five dollars on this album out of the discount bin at the music store. If you want grunge music buy Nirvana or Pearl Jam instead. Or if you want a Christian alternative, get Switchfoot's newer albums. But as for this album, stay clear."
2,Grammatrain fails to amuse me.,"This CD is one of the blandest CD's that I've ever listened to. There are only three good songs on this CD. I believe that their first album, Lonely House, is much better. If Your are thinking about buying a Grammatrain CD, don't get this one."
2,"Nice style, but band sucks","This watch is real slick looking, until you unbox it and see that the band is all one piece. If you look at the picture closely, the bottom part of the face shows where the other end of the one piece band actually wraps around, making that end larger than the other end. Not a great design."
2,"dials not white, strange strap","The dials are not white and silver. It's some kind of pink. The strap is just one long buckle strap that you wrap around the other end of the timepiece, this is unexpected. My wrist is smaller than the size used for storage so I needed to tighten the strap but the negative part of doing this is that the storage size left a fold (impression) on the leather leaving a raised/rounded area on the strap -- it will not lay flat on my wrist."
2,DOA,"The watch looks fine, but arrived with a dead battery. So much for saving a trip to the jeweler..."
2,Not what I expected,The band happens to be white and not gray as is shown in the picture. The band is also an abnormal buckling strap.
5,Absolutely Engaging,"Cole was originally told to create a character like Will Eisner's Spirit, and instead created something entirely wonderful. The originality and dark humor make this book stand out from all others. It appears innocent enough, and it is great fun, but there is an undercurrent of something wry in the late Mr. Cole's work, maybe even a little devilish. Read these originals from the original creator. It will be worth your while."
1,Poorly written & illustrated,"I ordered this book thinking it would have techniques similar to quilt as you go and prairie sky fun and done. I found it to be poorly written & poorly illustrated. The instrctions aren't clear & the illustrations don't protray what the instructions are trying to tell you. I wish Amazon had let you view the contents before purchasing. I wouldn't have purchased the book if I'd been able to ""thumb"" through it. I would consider myself to be an intermediate quilter. This book went back at my expense."
3,Machine Quilting in Sections,Very informative as to various ways to machine quilt in sections but the promo was misleading. It said the book would cover how to blind stitch the finishing srips on the back; the book said to consult your machine manual. For this I paid $18.00?
4,Good Baebes!,"This was not their best album; however, it was very nice. Three tracks stood out: Swete Sonne, So Spricht das Laben and Pearl. I think So Spricht das Laben stood out the most, just because it was so different...mostly spoken with harmonic backup. All in all, very listenable.If you get a chance to see them live, DON'T PASS IT UP!"
5,Classical Music So Sexy it's almost Pornographic,"You can make love to Motown; Or try this album. It is erotic, transformational and utterly delicious. Where did these baebes come from? The world never ceases to amaze me."
5,A Wonderful CD,"Less liturgical than Salva Nos, but with more punch than Undrentide, this is my favorite Baebes album."
5,Pure Blysse,"Catherine Blake is a genius for putting this ensemble together. Worldes Blysse shines and is pure blysse. The tracks that stand out are ""Erthe Upon Erthe"" and ""Passing Thus Alone"". Anyone who likes medieval music will love this. I recommend getting all 4. ""Salva Nos"", Worlds Blysse, ""Undrentide"" and the newest CD ""The Rose"". You will not be disappointed."
5,Awesome performance at Lilith Fair,I first heard this group at the Lilith Fair concert and was immediately taken. They have beautiful voices and their music is wonderfully relaxing.
3,"Beautiful harmonies, singers, and arrangements",I heard this group over the Christmas holiday on an iTunes radio station called Winterscape and had to get a CD. I got two.
5,The BEST Baebes album!,"Have you heard a few Mediaeval baebes songs but are wondering which album to start with? Start with Worldes Blysse and you'll be hooked on the Baebes!! I listen to celtic music (bothy band, deanta, clannad, lothlorien, ect. ) but also love moody haunting medieval music as well. This Baebes album for me is their best. Haunting melodies, true medieval sounding music (with memorable hooks - not mundane medieval music you forget 2 minutes after listening to it) with brilliant harmonies, and no ""modern"" instruments! This music is PERFECT for getting in the mood to go to a renaissance faire! (or to listen to while you're driving to that renaissance faire) The last 2 albums have introduced some modern elements in a few songs (drums,guitar,ect.) although the Baebes still are one of my favourites. Start with ""worldes blysse"" , if you love this album as I do, then try ""undrentide"" and ""sal va nos"". I have still yet to get ""the rose"" , but I think it's just a matter of time!"
2,Sad attempt of uniqueness results in no reverance,"I was mentioning to friend recently that the worse Christmas music usually comes from Christian artists. This validates it. I would give it one star but ""A Cradle Prayer"" is a really good song.The songs have no reverance. I understand wanting to put your own mark on songs that have been around forever and sung by basically everyone, but these are awful arrangements. If you want a great Christmas record get Kathy Mattea's Good News - and I am an agnostic."
2,Weird and disappointing,"I agree whole-heartedly with one of the other reviewers. This CD is definitely going for the ""ethereal"" and coming out with eerie. Very disappointing from Ms. St. James, and not a good mix with her already unique (and usually beautiful) voice. Give me the traditional any day."
2,Christ-m(etal)-as,"A fan of Rebecca St. James, I found this album to be disappointing in the end. I originally loved the album and enjoy her takes on ""Sweet Little Jesus Boy"" and ""O Holy Night,"" but the loud, head-banging selections on nearly every song on this album make it a near headache instead of a worshipful experience. St. James could have done better with her album. Those who are fans of her album ""God"" will enjoy this album. Those who prefer the techno-driven ""Transform"" over the heavy-rock inspired ""God"" would probably have a hard time listening to ""Christmas."""
2,Trying to be modern means noise ?,Christmas songs with a twist - the electronic guitars etc. makes this a compliation of noise. Sorry.
5,A unique twist to all your favorite carols + one to add,"She sets the traditional carols to different music styles. It really is very unique. I love ""Silent Night"". She hums the verses and sings the chorus. Somehow it makes you ponder the words & their meaning more. ""A Cradle Prayer"" is her own. Its so beautiful and worshipful. Here is the chorus: Jesus, I love You, my Lord, my Life. Where would I be without You? Here in the quiet, the still of the night, I am in awe of You"
5,It is a good buy!,I enjoy listening to this CD. Rebecca has turned the traditional hymns into something really beatiful to listen to.
5,very enjoyable,Thank you for this cd. It is wonderful to listen to. I would recommend it to everyone.. Merry Christmas to you all at amazon.com.
5,From the Back Cover,"""It is an urgent necessity that Eastern and Western intellectual traditions be bridged in order to establish a new spiritual foundation for the one world to come. This book is an excellent anthology which pursues this very task in its focus on C.G. Jung -- a unique and originative Western thinker in the field of depth psychology -- and Buddhism."""
4,Listen to this if you're unfamiliar with Palestrina,"This disc seems to be a great introduction to the music of Palestrina. Missa Papae Marcelli is definitely the highlight. The choral artistry is exquisite on this work and also on the Missa Aeterna Christi Munera. The Stabat Mater doesn't seem too bad, either. I have heard better recordings of Allegri's Miserere, however. Richard Marlow and the Cambridge Trinity College Choir do a fabulous job with this work on their double set entitled ""Choral Moods."""
2,Guitar Strap,The strap was to short for my full size 12-string guitar! Then I tried it on my takamine six string and no dice to tight>
3,Acceptable quality,"Unlike the other Planet Waves strap I order that was labeled ""leather"" but was in fact, vinyl. This one is leather. Hard, dry, leather. After some conditioning it's ok."
2,perhaps the poorest quality strap ever,"Took a month to arrive, seller didn't respond to e-mail, and when it finally arrived it was a huge disappointment. It's a 3"" hard leather strap for the price a good suede or glove leather strap. No padding, to call it ""basic"" would be overly flattering. It's hard to screw up a strap, but these guys managed it.Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."
2,Are you Kidding Me?!,"The title of this book is a glowing reminder of all that is wrong with Christian publishing. The title is ridiculous and stunningly irreverent. Is getting a catchy title on the front of your book worth throwing scatologically-tinged references to the Second Coming on the front cover?! If it wasn't so sad, I would start dying laughing at the apparent ignorance of the writer and publisher to the fact that most will do a double-take upon seeing this book and then snicker.I guess however that this book will fit perfectly right next to all of the shallow ""Jesus Junk"" peddled by Christian bookstores all over the world."
5,new bathroom exhaust fan,"unbelievably fast shipping time from amazon! standard shipping got it to my doorstep in 2 days.the fan itself is very well made. it is quite handsome to me, and my bride says it is pretty! it was a straightforward install, other than the preexisting fan occupied a smaller cutout in the ceiling. once i enlarged the opening in the ceiling, the rest of the project went off without a hitch.the previous fan never seemed to clear the bathroom of moisture completely, even when left to run 30 minutes or longer.this new fan, rated at >100 cfm, does the job very well, always within 20 minutes. so, to conclude, i'm happy with the product, and continue to be very impressed with the selection and service at amazon."
4,Nice and modern unit,I like the design and finish of this fan/light. It's not too loud and works well in our half bathroom.The only complaint I have is the installation of the top cover being tricky and annoying.
3,Works fine,"Works fine, a bit louder than I had hoped for. I slight lower standard than I have come to expect from Hunter fans."
5,perfect solution!,"The Riazzi bath fan and light is simple understated elegance in the bathroom. My partner and I installed this one with a tri switch (like this one on Amazon: Broan P65W 3-Way Heater/Fan/Light Switch)and it is performing beautifully. Most bathroom fans are eyesores, but not only is this one great to look at, it is also the quietest fan I have ever been around. I love the two choices for light output, and we are planning on experimenting with colours for the night light. Light output is soft and diffused, which I like in the bathroom, and blends well with the two pendant lights we have over our vanity. Great choice, easy to install."
1,Not worth the trouble,I bought this thinking that since it is stainless steel it would be strong enough to chop almonds. Wrong. It impales them on the blades on the first chop. I agree with the first reviewer - it takes forever to chop a small amount of softer nuts such as pecans or walnuts.
2,Good until your baby throws up on it!!!!,"I really, really liked this carseat even though it was a little big for my mazda protege 5. My baby always seemed to be very comfortable in it and I never really had any problems with adjusting the straps(My husband could never figure out the straps). Overall not too bad. But OH MY GOD!!! This weekend my son had a little vomiting episode and the carseat cover was messed up. I had to buy a new carseat because it took my husband and I a whole hour to take the cover and straps off...needless to say we had to take the whole thing apart. I am not sure that we will ever be able to put it back together, and even if we do, how safe will it be??? I think we totally compromised it safety. I guess I got my $$$'s worth because I've had it for over a year but it was still in good shape. I got lucky this didn't happen before."
2,good luck with the velcro,no problem getting in car... pretty easy... once I put my 7 month old in the seat he started pulling the inside towards his month. The back part is velcro to the back. MY 7 month old pull off.. lets just say the seat was returned.
2,triumph car review,I thought this car seat would be about the best one to have for my new grandson. I didn't like it!! It is hard to buckle the straps. The strap that comes up between the legs is a little on the short side. It was too hard to get in and out of when it is facing the rear.
1,IMPOSSIBLE TO CLEAN,"My daughter threw up in this seat the first week we had it. You cannot clean this seat. The cover has to be unscrewed off and the seat has to be unscrewed from the base and the back. WHAT A DISASTER!!!!Also, the seat cover does NOT wash well, and the company was very unhelpful!!! There are MUCH better and EASIER seats out there. Don't waste your money on this seat!"
3,Safety is Top Notch--Fabric Isn't!!,"I bought this car seat for it's safety rating and overall comfort and support. It worked well for my first child until I had to wash it. The backing fabric around the head pillows is dissolving and the imitation chenille front fabric is getting patchy areas where the texture is wearing away. I called to order another cover, as I was very satisfied with the structure and design of the seat itself. (...) I decided I would rather buy another car seat that had more durable fabric and more features, so that I could pass it on to my third child without having to buy yet another cover. (...) If they would make a different cover for the Comfort Touch, I would have bought another one."
4,A good seat but hard to clean,"We have this car seat for our son. He's used it since he was 9 months old, and is now 2 1/2. We had the unfortunate circumstance in which he vomited while sitting in the seat. We removed the cover to wash it, but the straps were also stained, and there was dried vomit that got inside the space where the straps attach to the bottom of the seat. We took the whole thing apart, yet there is no way to remove the straps for cleaning. The result is dried yuck inside the seat. It smelled pretty bad for a while, and not being able to clean it, our only option was to spray it with lysol."
3,Comfortable but strap crazy,"My husband and I did a lot of research before buying this seat and we loved the comfort and safety factor. The only complaint I have is that the straps are doubled making it hard to adjust the straps when you put the baby in a snowsuit verses a jacket, etc. The handles to adjust the straps to lessen or tighten them is on the side which is great but you have to pull them infront and adjust it evenly before you can use the handles to tighten the left over. It is difficult to explain until you try it. Best advice I can give is try it yourself at babies R us. They have models on the sales floor you can try it out and work on the adjusting yourself. If you have a friend or someone you know that has a car seat ask them what to look for before buying one."
3,"Good carseat, but not big enough","This is a very comfortable, easy to use carseat. It also isn't that expensive. The only problem that I have with it is that my son, who is only 2 and 34 pounds, can barely fit in the harness. I have to pull it so tight that it almost hurts him and with his winter coat he doesn't fit at all. It says that it can fit children up to 40 pounds, but I guess that is a taller thinner 40 pounds. So, after only 3 months of use, I am going to the Britax Husky. This one holds up to 80 pounds in a 5 point harness."
1,cleaning?,how the heck do you clean this thing!!! I loved it until my son threw up and we had to cut part of the material to get it into the laundry and you still cant get into the inside area even after spraying it down more than a few times with a power washer. cant they make this easier?????!!!
3,Just an ok seat,"I read a lot of reviews before choosing a seat for my 6 month old son. This seat stood out among the rest as both affordable and easy to use. At least the affordable part was right.My husband and I are not stupid people. However, when we took this seat out of the box and tried to adjust the shoulder straps, it took both of us and almost an hour to figure it out. Not a good introduction to the product, but my husband did say it was easy to install in the rear-facing position. We're just not sure how you fit a toddler in this thing. Our son is 20 lbs. and almost 27 inches long---he already looks a little snug, especially when he's wearing a coat. I wouldn't purchase this seat again, but we won't be replacing it yet, either."
5,Great seat!,"I did a lot of research before deciding on this seat. My son is eight months old, and we have had this seat for almost two months. He loves it, because he can see more than he could in his baby car seat, and he seems so much more comfortable. I installed it myself, and do not think that it was difficult at all, it fits well, doesn't move around, and seems very secure. There were other car seats that I decided not to purchase, based on the size of the seat. We have two mid-sized cars, one newer and one pretty old car, and this seat fits perfectly in both cars. Since my son is still an infant, we haven't tried it forward facing, but so far we love it as a rear facing seat. I would recommend this seat to anyone."
3,adjustment a real pain,"We bought this seat based on safety record and other users comments. However, I now wish we had bought a different seat. Our son is growing like a weed and the belts need constant adjustment. Adjusting the straps is a real hassle and it is not easy to do. The belt system seems over-engineered and it is difficult to get them snug without being overly tight. It's almost impossible in the back seat of a sedan with the kid in the seat.I'd look at other seats, and specifically the ease of adjustment, before buying this seat.Other than the adjustment issue, we're satisfied with the seat."
1,Very Cumbersome Car Seat,After much contemplation we decided to buy the Evenflo car seat and I am now returning it. I took it to the fire department today to have it checked out. The certified installers were at a loss with this car seat because the straps would not loosen but they would tighten. They even called Evenflo and all they did was repeat their horrible instruction. Finally after removing the car seat and 1 hour later they were able to install it again. To my dismay the straps did not stay in the same position as the certified installers had them in and now I am returning it to buy a Britax. All I can say is you get what you pay for!One other note the instructions throughout were not well written and the certified installers agree.
1,not for tall babies,"This is not a seat for a tall baby. 1)My ds outgrew it before I could turn it forward facing because the seat back is not tall enough. His head was 1"" from the top at 7 mos. 2) The shoulder straps fell off his shoulders because you can't use the top slots rearfacing for safety reasons. There was a recall on the shoulder strap problem, but Evenflo said that my seat didn't qualify for it. The straps basically fell off because his shoulders were too high for the slots.Granted he is off the chart in height, but we only used the seat for 4 mos and then had to buy yet another convertible. This seat was a complete waste of my fil's $."
2,"Okay seat for the money, but Britax is much better.","I bought this seat because Consumer Reports gave it a good rating and it was much less expensive than the Britax. My two main issues with it are: 1) My daughter (9 months old) always looks slumped in it. Her head falls way forward whenever she falls asleep in the seat, to the point where it is almost in her lap, and 2) The straps constantly require adjusting and are difficult to adjust. Even after I get them in the right position, it seems like they are too loose or too tight the next time we get in the car. Also, the straps dig into my daughter's neck and don't have padding on them like some other seats do.I ended up buying the Britax Marathon for our second car, and am much happier with it. If I were doing it over again I would spend the extra money and get the Britax for both cars."
4,First carseat,"I recently purchased two of these car seats - I have to agree that the straps are hard to adjust we had to read the instructions several times before figuring out how to get my daughter to fit. I was a little dissatisfied with Babies R Us because out of the two car seats one was broken...it had been returned and they had not checked it before returning it to the shelf. The nob that tightens the straps did not work. This is the third time I have purchased something from Babies R Us and got it home and it was broken in some way. I would not buy a car seat from them - if you are on line use Walmart or Target...it is not worth the chance that it may be broken, especially when safety is what you are looking for with this car seat."
3,Okay seat,"After doing much research, we decided to purchase this seat for my husband's car. This seat was right at the top of the Consumer Reports crash test ratings right next to the Britax Roundabout that we already owned for my car. At the time we couldn't afford to spend another $200 on another carseat and thought, hey this seat has excellent ratings for much less money, why not. We have found this seat to be more difficult to use. There are straps EVERYWHERE! And the tightening knob...my daughter seems to fall between the clicks. If we click to try to get her snug it is way too snug on her belly and looks uncomfortable, however to loosen only one click it seems too loose. I realize this is a good, safe carseat, however, if we had to choose again, we would definately spend the extra dollars on another Britax Roundabout."
3,Not our first choice,"I can't say this was my favorite carseat, it's actually my least favorite so far.... but I suppose it could have been worse. It was given to us as a gift when our daughter outgrew her pumpkin seat (also Evenflo, and we loved it!). I really liked it at first, seemed easy to use, LATCH was flawless and reclines were good while rear-facing. When we turned her around at 1 year, her head was constantly flopping forward, regardless of recline position. Also, the first time I tried to take the cover and straps off to launder, it was a mess. I still never figured out how to get the straps off.Also, the straps seem uneven on her shoulders. When one is snug, the other is either too tight or too loose. We opted to replace the carseat with the Evenflo Tribute with the overhead shield, and REALLY love it!"
2,Hated the strap system,Tried the Triumph Premier for 3 weeks and just returned it for the Britax Roundabout. Hated the straps - could never adjust them correctly. The chest clip slipped down every time and one shoulder strap would slide off my baby's shoulder even though I had the straps as snug as they needed to be. The straps seemed too wide for my 6 month old and she is a tall baby. The quality on the Roundabout construction is much better. I also did not like the foam which could be exposed by lifting the cover.
3,Not recommended for infants,"This carseat says it is recommended for infants but I would not recommend it. The seat makes my infant's head fall to one side or the other, since there is no head support. The belts to keep an infant in place are too big and bulky. The harness crossing the infant's chest does not like to open easy. It takes several attempts to get both sides open at the same time. This seat would be great for a toddler who is more than 20 lbs. but not for an infant."
5,Awesome Seat,"We received another seat as a shower gift and ended up taking it back and exchanging it for this seat. The lady in te car seat department was so helpful and told us that this seat was one of the safest seats you can buy. For the price you couldn't beat it. We were looking at getting a more expensive seat that went all the way to 100 lbs. and served as a booster too, but the lady said for the money you could get this seat and then buy the booster later and spend the same. This has been an excellent seat, my child is 13 months old and has used this seat since he was 4 months and I have no complaints. The straps have never gotten twisted, and it is so easy to get him in and out. Overall this seat is AWESOME!!!"
5,A great buy!,"We initially looked at the Graco and Britax car seats once Grace grew out of her infant seat, but Grace seemed too basic and Britax was so expensive. After reading the reviews on this site we bought this model and are so happy we did so. This seat looks, feels and performs to a very high standard. The knobs for adjusting the straps are very easy to use once the seat is in the forward facing position. The shaping and padding of the seat make it very comfortable for our squirmy one year old. We'll definitely look at buying this brand again!"
5,Easy to use!,"I have wrangled babies and toddlers into countless carseats over the years (nieces, nephews, friends, etc.) and this is by far the best one I've ever used. LATCH makes it a snap to install, and it is very easy to adjust and fasten. Unlike some carseats, you don't have to break your finger trying to undo the belt. And it must be pretty comfy, because my daughter loves to rest her head and nap in it! :DMy only ""caution"" or ""caveat"" is that the chest snap sometimes needs an extra squeeze before it pops into place. Listen for the sound to make sure it's securely fastened-- otherwise it may not *quite* snap and can wiggle undone. This is, however, a very minor thing, and I love the seat!"
5,Best Car Seat I've Seen,"We recently bought the Triumph for my son and it is so great. I had done a lot of research and this one rated the highest in safety. I love the recline settings, he likes to sleep in the car and I didn't want his head falling forward. The straps are easy to adjust. Installing it into my Elantra was a breeze. I can still fit my nephew's carseat and booster next to it with no problem and the padding is great. My son absolutely loves it! I would highly recommend this seat. We had also tried the Graco Comfortsport but it was too big for my car and it didn't recline. In the end there was just no comparison. The Triumph won hands down."
2,Too much work,I bought two of these seats for our twins. One tension knob was broken and we struggled to turn and tighten the straps - what a pain. Too many straps - my husband had the boys arms all twisted up and they wailed. I had to straighten the straps after just 2 days. It was enough to drive you mad. We returned them and bought the Britax Marathon. More money but WAY worth the money - no headaches and it is an awesome seat.
1,car seat like no other,"I purchased this seat for my four month old. He is large for his age and needed more room. I would put him in and while driving noticed that the chest clip would slide down. It would work its way down no matter what I did. When I contacted Evenflo they suggested I teach him not to play with the clip. I was completely outraged. I have purchased numerous seats over twenty years and never had a problem like this. I will not recommended this product to anyone. It is dangerous to say the least with the chest clip sliding down just from normal movement of the vehicle. I don't know what upsets me more, the fact that Evenflo brushed off my complaint or that I now am out looking for another car seat and have wasted my money on this one."
3,Not good for travel,"We bought this carseat for my daughter when she outgrew her infant seat. It was a great carseat, but with 2 complaints. First, its very wide and takes up a lot of room, even in our Tahoe. Second, its heavy and very cumbersome to travel with. We exchanged it for a Britax Marathon. It seems that Britax is THE seat to have, regardless of the price."
5,We have purchased 3 (our 2 autos + 1 for grandparents auto),"After extensive research and countless review readings from actual owners of this car seat, the Evenflow Triumph 5 (Rockefeller and Aristotle models), it was determined that this convertible car seat was the best and safest one for our precious first child.Since day one (11/20/03), this convertible has been used with ease in our two household vehicles. We have been so impressed that we bought a 3rd one for our baby's grandparents vehicle. We are absolutely certain that this convertible will serve its intended purpose of absolute safety (technical sources confirm this), ease of use (personally confirmed) and affordability (personally confirmed) that all the research point towards.So, it is without qualification that our family recommends this unit to all parents that are looking to protect their child in a safe, easy to use car seat (or two or three)."
5,great seat,I love this seat for my son. He is extremely comfortable in this seat. I love the fact that it has a feature which allows you to adjust the recline. It is easy to load in and out of cars.
4,very comfy,"this seat is incredibly good. the only reason I gave it for stars is because I couldn't sit in it. it's almost like it was designed for a baby. I ended up giving it to my 23 year old nephew, as a joke"
3,Not safe for shorter children in forward facing position,"We really enjoyed this seat when we used it in the rear facing position; however, we have grave concerns about its safety in the forward facing position. As instructed by the car seat manual and the fire department where we brought the seat for installation, the straps must always be at or below the height of your child's shoulders. Unfortunately, the car seat is only approved for safety in the forward facing position when the straps are at the uppermost position. Our 18 month old child, who is in the 75% percentile for height, is not even close to being tall enough to have the straps in the uppermost position; therefore, we cannot safely use it in the forward facing position. As a result, we are now having to pay the $200 for a new seat, so he can ride safely in the forward facing position."
1,Worst seat ever,This car seat is great as long as it is not in a car- Once this seat was installed in our car by the local fireman we could not get to the tighten/loosen knob located on the side of the chair. The design is horrible- with the knob on the lower side- it is impossible to move- and I tighten and loosen ever time I put the baby in and out of the seat.I would not recommend this seat to anyone. We ended up returning the seat to Babies R Us and buying a second Britax.
2,We don't like it!,We purchased this car seat 4 days ago for our 8 month old son. He screams every time we try to put him in it. Also the shoulder straps fall off of him. It fit perfect in our little 2 door car but the straps made it not worth the effort. I am taking this car seat back today.
5,Very easy and safe,I love this car seat. The saftey rating by consumer alerts is what brought me to purchase this seat in the first place. I refuse to purchase any car seat that does not have very good and excellent ratings. It is very easy to latch into the car. Adjusting the belt can sometimes be hard on the hand but all in all also very easy to do. My 10 month old falls asleep very quickly and seems to be comfortable with the soft padding. I also like the fact that the padding is well secured which cannot be said for a lot of other car seats. We baught two and got my sister to purchase one for her daughter as well.
5,"Very Safe, Comfortable, Easy to Use, and Affordable!","I did a lot of research on which car seats are the safest, the most comfortable, the easiest to use, and the most affordable. This is the best car seat for the price. It sits higher in the car than most other seats and has much more padding. The seat itself looks very comfy and my daughter really seems to like riding in it - she falls asleep right away. The manual is easy to understand and it shows you how to adjust the seat in the car without difficulty (even in a rear-facing position). It is simple to adjust the shoulder straps WITHOUT taking the seat out of the car. And, it is comparable to the Britax but more than $100 cheaper. Not to mention the upholstery on the seat is very stylish and even large people can fit on either side of it in small cars. My husband and I are EXTREMEly pleased with this car seat."
3,Seems too good to be true at first!,"We bought this carseat when my son was 4 months old. He loved it, I loved it, seemed like the perfect answer. WRONG!! The ease of use is great, the padding on the carseat is wonderfull, the fact that this carseat actually fit in my car was the big selling point for me. However, now my son is 14 months old and is outgrowing the carseat in height. He only weighs 22lb, yet his head is only 1 in from the top of the carseat.The company advertises this carseat for up to 40lb, however no child weighing 40lb is going to fit in the carseat. They will get too tall before ever reaching the weight limit! I am so mad, I bought this carseat thining this would be the convertable carseat that would get my son to a booster seat, now I realize that I just waisted my money!!"
5,GREAT,My 1 year old is very small for her age. She was only 32 inches and 18 pounds when we made the change. She loved it right away. The straps are a cinch to adjust and she sits so comfy. It was expensive but worth every penny.
1,Another unauthorised waste of time dvd,"The title of my review says it all but I will elaborate. This is totaly made up of interviews of music journalists. Not one interview of anyone involved in Elton's caree past or present. No interviews with Elton, (exepting very small clips of old film stock) Bernie, or members of the Elton John bands past or present. I watched the first eight minutes and knew this was a complete waste of time. To sum it up: Avoid this."
2,Obviously unauthorized and made on the cheap,"There is more to be learned about Elton in a few pages of Philip Norman's biography of Elton than in this hour plus video. No actual Elton music is used or album covers shown. The minimal stock photos and video are disappointingly sparse, many used more than once. The graphics used to show album chart peak dates are cheesy and primitive. The journalists interviewed do include the aforementioned Philip Norman and Paul Gambaccini. They know a lot about Elton's life, but they apparently chose to participate in this project for personal financial gain. The ""extras"" on the DVD contain interview footage of the journalists not used in the actual documentary. The most interesting portions of this video are news archival snippets about health problems, court cases, and Princess Diana's death and funeral. Nothing much here to recommend. Get a copy of ""Tantrums and Tiaras"" for an entertaining and interesting look at the real Elton John."
1,A joke,"Fortunately, I got this for very cheap. An Elton John documentary with not even one second of Elton John music in it... The background music is made of generic instrumental music, mostly guitar-based. And generic fake covers of Elton John records are used to illustrate releases. Apart from a couple of gossips and the funny characterization of present-day Elton John as a hybrid of Queen Mum and a penguin, not much to remember in there."
1,uh...,"uh... no. i had a 20 watt 2 channel sterio, and it couldnt even handle it. it trys to hit bass and cant perform it, there not louud. there not bass'ey, there not anything, firepitis where mine went i bought 2, so ik it isnt the speaker"
2,Misleadingly named,This book covers web-clipping and related topics almost exclusively. It is in NO way an overview of Palm Programming. I had to return my copy. The Palm OS Bible is vastly superior.
5,JavaScript comes to Palm Web Clippings,"I write a lot of Web clippings--in the past--users would submit forms that had to make a ""round trip"" from the palm to the server back to the palm because the user omitted a form or entered an errant value.The book shows how to validate a form's contents before shipping it to the server. (If you work on the Web, you would use JavaScript to do validate the form's fields--but JavaScript doesn't exist in Web clippings). The book shows you an invaluable work around."
