4,Good work,It is so much faster than heating water on the stove and provides boiling water for tea much better than the microwave.I recommend it if you use boiling water for anything on a regular basis.Good price
5,Great Kettle,"I have only positive things to say about this kettle. It looks great, nice enough to leave out on the counter. It works quickly and is easy to use."
5,good,It's good for me to use and convenience to anyone. I hope it is suit to many student just like me.
2,I bought it for my baby...but,"I bought it for my baby.There are two things that I don't like it.First, it is too noisy. When I boil water, the boiling sound too loud and noisy.Second is that something is deposited at the bottom after I boiled water, even spring water.Still I don't know what the deposit is.Except these two things, I have used it well so far."
2,Stainless Steel came with Stains.,"I ordered this as a Xmas gift for someone. Upon arrival and inspection of the kettle I noticed several large stains on the side. At first I didn't find this to be a problem since I thought I could just clean it off and wipe away the stains. Unfortunately, the stains did not come off. I returned it to Amazon for a refund and bought it at Walmart for $2 extra."
4,THE BEST AND QUICKEST WAY TO MAKE TEA/COFFEE,"THIS PRODOCUT IS A REALLY NICE PRODUCT, THE FASTEST AND QUICKES WAY TO MAKE TAE/COFFEE OR GET BOILED WATER.PERFECT FOR OFFICES, HOME, EVERY WHERE YOU CAN USE IT. IT IS THE BEST.Aroma AWK-115S Hot H20 X-Press 1-1/2-Liter Cordless Water Kettle"
2,"loud noise,","I don't suggest to anybody to buy this item. it has a very LOUD NOISE,wich is very desturbing."
5,Best Hot Water Kettle Ever,This is a wonderful little kettle. It heats hot water quietly and in an instant and readily detaches from the heating base. And it looks so much nicer than the white plastic instant kettles that are so common. I liked it so much I bought a second one for my office.
2,"Great Product, just be careful","The tea kettle works very well. It is quick, efficient and looks nice on the counter. However, I never thought the shell would not be insulated. The outside of the kettle will give you very severe burns. It is as hot as the boiling water on the inside. It is very dangerous for our small grandchildren and myself as I reach for it. I am surprised they are even allowed to sell this item."
3,Not Bad,"It's nice and small... easy to clean, however, it's just a little loud. It would have been a great kettle if not for that."
2,faulty auto shut off,"This would be a great deal, it is quick to boil and large capacity, but the auto-shutoff doesn't work. Additionally I have a feeling that while I have only owned it for a week or two, it will rust. I am led to that belief based on imperfections in the surface."
3,Works fine but has flaws,"I've had this for 1.5 years. The kettle works fine. However, the filter tears easily when trying to be cleaned of hard water flakes and deposits. Now the inside black plastic is breaking up, we've seen black particles floating in the water. Nothing lasts forever."
1,Broke on fourth use,Purchased some months and used it once to confirm it worked. Started using it again this week but after four times it won't work anymore. Heating flap stays down and light comes on but unit won't heat and also won't automatically shut off. Called toll free number and it looks like they may send a replacement or just a new base power unit since this is on backorder? Anyway it appears they are taking care of the issue.
1,defective,"The kettle worked great for us for about a month. then i started noticing when I would come back to the kettle later in the day, there would always be a pool of water around the heating element on the counter. I finally realized that the seam between the silver metal and the black base of the kettle has a leak so water is coming out. EVERY time i use it.i'm pretty sure this is a safety issue considering the way this product works.looked at the return policy and looks like I'd only get a partial refund and have to pay for shipping myself to send it back. pretty disappointing, i'd rather have a replacement since it sounds like everyone else's kettles are working without a hitch.EDIT: Amazon refunded my pot and is letting me ship it back at to extra cost to me. Will be purchasing a good ol' stovetop kettle from amazon instead. can't go wrong with that. Thanks!"
1,Auto shut-off stopped working early on,We only used this product for a few months before the auto shut-off stopped workingand the kettle would boil itself dry (fire hazard?).We just dusted off our old Hamilton Beach which was encrusted with hard water depositand had started leaking a bit and it gave us another year (died tonight).We're going for another Hamilton Beach unit.PS: My wife also got this Aroma model for her work place and has also had problems with it.
4,Nice to have a stainless steel pot.,"But the designers didn't really think this through. If you open the lid for the pot to dry out after using, you'd better wait until it is completely cool w/ no condensation on the cap - It is position so that it does NOT drip back into the pot like my old plastic Melitta model did, but to drip right on top of the handle where the water creeps down the side of the pot and snakes its way into the on/off switch. Kind of annoying, but not worth returning over."
1,bad quality,"I bought it in Augest. When I received it, it did not work. The seller promise me to return a new one. I received a new one in Oct, but now the item does not work again!!!!Bad quality!!!!"
1,AUTO SHUT OFF FAULTY,"Unpacked the kettle and followed instructions. Tried boiling 5 different times with lid properly closed, etc. AUTO-SHUT OFF feature never kicked in.... even after handle was hot, kettle was shaking, etc. Fire hazard. Returning this kettle. Bummer! Even for $30, i want a kettle that will shut off."
3,I like my other one better,"I had previously bought the T-fal BF6520003 Vitesses 1.7-Liter 7-Cup Electric Kettle to keep at work, but when I wanted to get a kettle to keep at home I figured I could get a cheaper one since I wouldn't be using it as much. This one is ok, but the T-fal BF6520003 Vitesses 1.7-Liter 7-Cup Electric Kettle is much better. I'd spend the extra money and get another one of those if I had to do it again."
1,Great until it stopped working.,"I have had this kettle for about 18 months. Up until Sunday when it just stopped working, I would have given it 5 stars. It heated water quickly and the price was good. But now, since it is inoperable, it only deserves one star."
2,Look pretty good but doesn't work well,"I have received this kettle really fast from Amazon Prime after 2 days ordered. However, when I received it, it looks like it has been used; Not only that but the kettle only work for 3 days and than it stop automatically shut off after boiling. Water leaking from the shutter(at the turn on/off).REALLY DISAPPOINTED.I will try to order another new one to see because I really need one."
2,Broke after 1.5 years,"I generally like this kettle. The light on the on/off switch broke after about 1.5 yrs, and then the whole thing broke a couple months later. It worked great until then, and I'm generally pleased with its functions and features. For my new one, I got a less expensive model. I expect a longer lifetime from something this expensive for the category."
5,great!,"Sent one to my boyfriend who is lazy lazy lazy... haha! He uses it every day, and it has served him well through the cold winter. He really appreciates it, how fast it boils water, and easy it is to use. I've also used it at his place a few times, and it's a great deal for the price! Would definitely buy again."
3,Handsome but Too Loud for Office Use,"If you're considering buying this kettle, know it creates a ton of noisy rumble. I work in a small enclosed space, and it's just too loud for office use. I have difficulty hearing phone calls and conversations when it's heating up. I never had this problem with my Bodum kettle, but it, unfortunately, died an early death.My search continues for the perfect electric kettle. I'll take ugly on the outside, if it's quiet and reliable on the inside for making lots of wonderful tea."
4,The little kettle that could,"I have had this kettle for at least five years now. We bought it because we were tired of the kettle on the stove getting covered in grease and boiling dry because we didn't hear the whistle. This kettle is very fast and efficient, stays nice and clean, sits on the counter right next to our coffee pot (we use a Chemex) and boils water perfectly every time. My only criticism is that occasionally (and for no apparent reason) the button will not pop up and stop the kettle. I've never had the kettle boil dry, even when I've gone in another room and forgotten about it, so maybe it eventually pops up. When this happens, I just hit the button up and the kettle stops. For the price, I consider it a small defect, but it does keep it from receiving 5 stars. (I did not buy this kettle through Amazon.)"
2,worked for one year,"The Aroma water kettle worked for fine a year, then simply stopped working. This is another item added to the heaps of small electric appliances and electronics that have lasted me less than two years."
5,Electric tea kettle,Love my kettle use it all the time would not be without beats heating water on stove or in microwave.
2,It worked until it started leaking,"I was happy with my Aroma AWK-1155 - it heated up the water very quickly. Yes, it was noisy doing so, but I could handle that. I bought it because I wanted a metal kettle so I wouldn't have to worry about BPA leaching from the plastic, especially with repeated use boiling. I was using it at least 2-3 times/week and after 3 months I started to see water appearing on the stand under the pot after using it. It wasn't in a dangerous place, but any water accumulating under an electric item is not proper. It was too late to return it, but I would not buy another one & I cannot recommend this item for anyone else to purchase."
4,I love my kettle -- with one caveat!,"The very first time I used the kettle, I did not push the lid down fully -- it does require a good purposeful little click to close-- and the auto shut-off did not engage. Luckily, I was right there and noticed it seemed to be boiling for too long, and I figured out the problem. That only happened once! Since then, I've loved it. Yes, the outside gets hot, but so does a kettle on the stove. I chose this one because I like the fact that water does not come into contact with plastic, or directly with the element. I've had now for nearly a year, and use it every day. Perfect. Fast. Good-looking. What's not to love?"
4,Good Tea Kettle,"A lot of people are saying that the tea kettle is really loud when the water is boiling. This would be horrible in an office but since i use it at home its great because usually know when the water has boiled. Its really pretty but the outside gets dirty so fast. Its really annoying to keep wiping it down after each use. Also it would have been great if it had a whistle or something. But it does what it was supposed to do well. I have had several electric tea kettles before so i can say that it doesnt boil water all that fast but it still does it faster than the conventional way. Overall, I am satisfied."
1,"Made In China, for sure.","Sounds like I got a better deal than many of these people. Mine worked for nearly a year until the shut off/on switch stopped working. It will either shut off every two seconds, or once it gets going it will not shut off by itself. Kinda seems like a fire hazard to me. Quality seemed okay, but it's obviously a disposable appliance, and I'm not interested in filling landfills with purchases, so I will be shopping for better quality with my next one."
1,Dont Waste Your Time,"I am a hot tea drinker and being from Ireland, wanted a good kettle as it will get allot of use.After a few weeks this is what I think of it1 - This Kettle is extremely noisy2 - It leaks when more than 1/2 full3 - It takes almost 3 minutes to shutoff after boilingI did ALLOT of research and after reading amazon reviews was sold, it really changed my opinion on amazon reviews. This was horrible. The only positive thing about this is I purchased from Amazon is returning is very easy and hassle free."
3,"I really like it, but...","I received this for a birthday gift and have really enjoyed it. The only problem is that I can't find anywhere that sells the ""*Easy-to-clean spout filter"". The screens broke and now I have no filter and no way to replace it."
2,"Leaks, Doesn't shut off...besides that pretty to look at",Sorry but this has not been the quality of the other pots I've had. Hope you had better luck with yours!!
3,Electric kettle,"It's a good electric kettle. I drink a lot of tea, so an electric kettle is a must have accouterment. One thing I've noticed is that it boils for a long time before auto turning off. Also, there is no thermostatic control on temperature - just boil or off.But like I say, it seems like a good product other than those slight problems."
5,"Great, efficient tea kettle","This is a great electric kettle! I've had it for a year now and it does not disappoint. Water (enough for one cup, takes a bit longer with more water) is ready for my teacup within two minutes of flipping the ON switch. I'm a college student and not only do I use the kettle in my dorm room, but I even bring it home for the holidays because it's fantastic! It's a little loud, but that's usually not an issue for me.I've only ever had a problem with it once, when it took a really long time for the water to be ready. The handle got too hot to touch and water spilled out of it. However, this has happened once out of hundreds of uses, so it was probably a user error rather than a product error (not closing the top completely or not setting it completely into the base).Overall, it's a great price for an easy-to-use device that makes my morning routine much, much easier."
1,Leaks,"Considering the many good reviews for this product, in less than a week, I noticed water leaking on the bottom of the kettle coming from the switch. Have returned the defective product."
5,Good Value and Quality,"I was looking for a new kettle after the handle snapped off my old Cuisinart one. It did last for about 5 years and you can still get the same one, but the handle is welded in only 1 spot and having the handle snap off a kettle of boiling water kind of puts you off. I looked at the best reviewed kettles and this one seemed as good as ones twice the price. As a jug style kettle it has a smaller footprint than my old one so it takes up less counter space. It has no exposed element and the inside is stainless steel, and so far it has been working pretty well, so hopefully it will hold up. The on/off switch looks like it is a little flimsy. I would recommend this kettle, it does what it is supposed to do basically."
3,Fast Boiler,The kettle looks a lttlie cheap and doesn't sit very solidly on its base - however it boils very quickly and for the price is good value.
5,Probably the only thing I use everyday other than the toilet!,"I've had it over a year (according to Amazon's purchase reminder) and I still LOVE it! It boils several cups within 5 minutes. It looks beautiful when it is clean and polished, but it is hard to keep clean in a hard water environment. To clean the inside, I boil a slice lemon or a few tablespoons of vinegar and water solution, then drain. Aroma is a great brand. I also have a rice cooker that I bought for $20 SEVEN YEARS AGO and it still works great today."
5,Hot Hot Hot,This crazy thing boils water in record time. Something about my propane stove always burns the crap out of anything not in cast iron but for some reason it takes forever to boil water in a kettle. This little thing will probably pay for itself in the propane it is saving me.Couldn't find one that didn't look completely stupid in the local stores so purchased this little guy. You just hit the little tab under the handle and in about 5 minutes or so you have a hot pot of water. It was a good deal but it probably wont save your marriage. I hope I get to keep it.
2,Broken Down in 10 Months,The kettle broken Down in 10 months. The power button couldn't be pressed down. Cheap product. Will not buy again.
4,a dandy tea kettle,"The Aroma Water Kettle is exactly as described in their ad, and boils water quickly. It replaces a Braun electric kettle that lasted only two years and I've high hopes for this one. The Braun was larger with a larger opening at the top which was slightly more convenient, but this is just fine. The only cavil is that it's on-light is apparently designed to be clearly visible only at eye level. It's pretty much invisible at counter-top level in daylight. But all in all, it's a dandy little kettle and well worth the price."
2,Didn't last long,"I bought this electric kettle for my mother, who is origionally from England so knows how to make a proper cup of tea! We have used electric kettles in England that are very durable, quick and so handy. I thought it would be great for my mother who lives here in the US. Unfortunately, the kettle didn't last but a few months then broke... It looked really lovely, but it's cheap. Spend more money and get a quality kettle!"
3,Good for a year,"I am a very heavy tea drinker and make 2 - 3 caps of tea a day so this particular tea kettle gets a lot of heavy use and after 6 months of using it here is my conclusion:Plus:1) No plastic smell2) No plastic taste3) Relatively fast4) ErgonomicMinus:one but big, after 6 months of use the glue holding black bottom of the tea kettle is coming out and there is a actually already a small leakage (just a few drops per cycle for now) but i am afraid one day the bottom will literal drop off on me.In conclusion, for occasional and light use this is perfect product but for heavy users spend a bit more on something more sturdy.P.S. I use filtered water so mineral deposits do not affect my tea kettle."
3,Wow it's noisy,"This kettle works alright overall (quick to heat the water), but it's remarkably noisy. Enough that you have to raise your voice a bit to have a conversation. It's a rumbling noise that starts soon after you turn it on. We also have a small plastic travel kettle, and that one is very quiet, right until the water is boiling. The outside metal also gets very hot (it's not insulated from the water at all).I wouldn't buy this model again, but it will do for now."
5,Can't live without my teakettle,"After being in Europe were I used lots of electric kettles, I had to have one for myself at home. This was a gift from my husband and I have since bought one for my brother and my dad. I can't live without it! So much faster than heating water on the stove. I use it for tea as well as heating water for pasta and other things. Very durable and easy. Great for an office, too."
4,Good buy for price you pay,This kettle has an appealing look and combines many features of much more expensive models. I bought it for our office kitchen. First couple of uses auto shutoff did not function though.When I was just about to pack it to send back it started working and has been good since then (by now almost 30 days) still working as it should. I wondered if we had issues with setting it on its base properly.Overall very good design and features. Good value. My in-laws got one too and theirs is working fine.
5,Works Great,"After 2 months of daily usage, the kettle works great. It's simple to use and has a sturdy metal feel, given the low price. I know that I haven't used the kettle long enough to write a detailed review, but so far I haven't see any signs of rust, loose parts, leaks, power failures, shocks, etc. I looked at few expensive kettles ($60 to $100), and decided to go with this highly rated product. You can also find it at Target, if you want to see how it feels. I haven't noticed any issues with the handle getting hot( as some people have mentioned ). However, the metal will get very hot ( but that's expected with all kettles )Suggestions- Maybe the outside of the kettle can have a heat strip that will turn red when the kettle has hot water."
4,Cordless Water kettle,I gave this as a gift to my daughter---she loves it and uses it everyday. She got used to water kettles when living in Europe and missed it when she returned to the states. She's a mother of 6 children and heats up the water for hot cereal and hot drinks. I have one too and take it when I travel. They are great in a hotel!
2,Will Not Turn Off!,This is a nice kettle but the automatic switch off function is useless.It doesn't work and just boils away endlessly until turned off manually.
2,Great while it lasts!,"I bought one for my office, attracted to good reviews and the nice finish with minimal plastic contacting the water. This latter feature is good for tea. It's not 100% but close. It worked great for a few months (about 3). Then the auto-off switch began to be unreliable. When the switch fails to shut off the heat, the water leaks out of that area of the pot and the water in the pot boils until I manually shut it off. I have never let it get to dryness. Luckily, I live in my office so no great harm done, but auto-off is a safety feature and if it starts a fire, that's a big, big problem. Aroma needs to make the switch reliable."
2,Low cost for mid-quality,"The good news about this Aroma kettle is that it does boil water, and does so quickly with a minimum of fuss. The manual lid of the kettle is a plus in my mind, as it's one less spring-loaded thing to break.However, you get what you pay for: mine had a very powerful and noxious plastic odor when I first received it, and I am not usually very sensitive to such things. The odor persisted through several scrubbings and rounds of boiling water, though I am happy to say it has not been a problem after the first few days of use. The bottom of my sample is also warped, so it doesn't sit flat on any surface, including the base. I would not buy this product again."
5,most used item in the kitchen,"I've had one of these for over a year and a half, and I use it several times a day. It's very fast, easy to clean and doesn't leave that nasty plastic taste behind. A great buy."
1,Became not functional within 4 months - go garbage,The kettle broke within 4 months in use. A friend at work tried to fix it but found that the heating element was corroded. It had to go garbage. The Aroma brand does not have good quality control and we would not buy from this brand again.
2,"heats water, but shorts out and turns EVERYTHING on circuit off when the water is hot!","Purchased this pot a little over a month ago (past the amazon return policy, so I guess I'll contact the manufacturer and play that game awhile) and noticed that the auto shutoff does not work when the water boils most of the time. That wasn't a huge deal, but it also sometimes trips the breaker on the circuit it's on and has to be reset. Not terribly convenient. Maybe I just got a lemon?"
2,2 out of 3 leaked,"It's really a pity, because it could be a great kettle: Nice design, the heating element is covered for easy cleaning, it is cordless and has a small-holed sieve which comes in very handy if there is a lot of calcium in the water. BUT: Two out of three leaked when left with water in them. This means that the base ends up standing in a puddle of water - DANGEROUS! I could replace them without problem, and the third one works as it ought to. But it was quite a lot of hassle, which I didn't bargain for."
2,Started leaking after two days,"The design and features are awesome, however, it started leaking from the bottom (where the black plastic meets the steel) after using it for two days. Now we have hot water super fast all over the counter."
3,It works,It boils water quick. I'm not impressed with the look. Looks unfinished especially where the nozzle is attached to the body.So it works but doesn't me love it.
5,Love It!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have been shopping for one of these electric kettles for a while, and this one just combined everything I needed, Price (very reasonable), the stainless steel looks, shape, and performance. I have been using it for few days already, it heats really fast and the automatic shutoff is handy too.I would recommend this product for anyone."
1,"Just got it, won't turn on","That's it, I just took it out of the box and it won't turn on, power light won't come on. The outlet is working fine, and the manual just says call costumer service... wonder if costumer service will make me some tea."
2,"Worked great for two years, then broke!","It worked great for two years, but within two days it kind of self destructed. The pins on the bottom of the kettle, or the metal piece that depresses on the base when the kettle is placed upon it broke. The next day, the on/off switch became faulty. Now it does not work at all."
1,Water tastes terrible - metallic and just spoils the tea,"I have washed this kettle many times to try and get the boiled water to not taste metallic, but nothing worksThis is a terrible kettlePlease avoid if you want your tea, or any other food or drink to taste like it should. My oatmeal tastes like metal, as does my tea & coffee. Gonna return this. Fail"
4,Fast but loud,"This kettle looks pretty good, and appreciate the extremely straightforward design... couldn't get any simpler. It also boils water very fast but boy can it get loud. It would have been nice to perhaps have at least one additional way to control the heating rate to reduce the noise, and/or provide a little control over the temperature.UPDATE*** 1 month in***I'm glad to report that the kettle gets much quieter after it has been seasoned for a while. Upgrading my review by a star"
5,"Excellent, durable, reliable electric kettle","I've been using this kettle for about a year. There's not much to say except it works well and is reliable. I'm buying another one to replace a piece of junk GE electric kettle I bought at a big box store, that thing didn't even make it a year and it leaks water, the lid broke, and now it won't turn on at all. But this Aroma kettle I had in my office has been working very well!"
1,BROKE AFTER ONE USE,"I rate items based on three criteria - Does it work as advertised? Does the value justify the cost? Does it improve my life? I put my recommendation at the top, then answer those three questions below.RECOMMENDATIONDon't buy it. This product does not work.FUNCTIONALITYI boiled one pot of water, then it never turned on again.VALUENo.DOES IT IMPROVE MY LIFE?It did the opposite."
2,Plastic odor and defective shut-off,"I was looking for a stainless steel hot pot to avoid chemical leaching from plastic into water. I was very disappointed in the plastic odor from plastic in contact with the water. Also, automatic shut-off did not work. Water kept boiling. Returned item."
2,Disappointing,"I've had the Aroma water kettle about a week. At first it seemed to work fine but then problems started. First, I discovered that the automatic shutoff, which works fine when the kettle is full, doesn't always work when the water level is near (but not below) the ""minimum"" mark. This is exactly when you need it most! Next, I found a piece of the plastic retainer (that holds the spout filter in place) lying at the bottom of the kettle after boiling some water, even though I hadn't touched the filter. Now the filter is loose. I plan to return this unit and buy another brand."
2,Would be nice except it does not shut itself off,"Seems like a lot of folks have had problems recently with these not shutting off (at all, or quickly) once the water boils, wonder if there was a bad batch of these?The pot itself is nice, holds a decent amount of water and does boil it fast. The baseplate is kind of flimsy, it doesn't sit flat on the counter until the pot is resting on it.The fact that it doesn't turn off relatively quickly after boiling is enough for me to return it. Gotta love Amazon - I already stupidly pitched the box it came in, but they'll accept it back no problem regardless.I would not buy one of these again, what I am going to buy instead is the Kalorik JK23431, which I already have one of and it works as expected and it a bit sturdier feeling and more attractive to look at in the kitchen (hence the bigger price tag). In this case you get what you pay for."
1,Auto off function is not working : (,"I just bought this kettle and thought it's a good deal with many good reviews. But as some people experienced that the auto shut off function didn't work, I also experienced the same right on the first time I used it. I am going to return it and get another brand instead. I guess the defective rate is pretty high, I am just the unlucky one who received the defective one."
3,Not the highest quality,"Boils water as advertised, but the auto-shut off switch stopped working after the first boil. Now we shut it off manually, by watching for steam comming out the spout and listening to the vigourous boiling sound. For $26, what do you expect?"
3,"Loved it, but leaked","Easy to order a replacement from Amazon. They are already sending me a new one and I don't get charged anything as long as I send the old one back within 30 days. Free return shipping, too. Hopefully, the next one won't leak because I was really liking it. Makes hot water much faster than a pot on the stove. Love the cordless design. I will try to update when I get the new one."
2,Failed after two years,"This kettle has worked flawlessly for exactly two years. We use it just once a day for morning beverages and a few other, occasional, water heating needs, like poached eggs. So it hasn't been pushed in terms of endurance. Last week it started acting up. After using it in the coffee press, I refilled with cold water and hit the switch - nothing. After a couple of minutes, I heard the water starting to heat, it ran for a few seconds then stopped heating (switch remained on). A minute or two later, another cycle - on for a while then off etc. until 15 minutes later the water was boiling. Fast forward to this week, first filling in the AM, no heat at first then 2 - 3 minutes cycles, until boiling is reached. It's a good looking unit at a great price but 2 years with only limited use is not acceptable. Buying the next kettle from Costco."
5,I never knew how handy this would be,"After a year of nearly daily use, mine is still churning out full batches of boiling water in a couple minutes. No need to fire up the stove and break out another kettle for boiling water - ramen, tea, recipes of all kinds requiring boiling water are all made convenient and easy! Mine seems to require a bit of a extra push to get the lid popped closed or it won't shut off, but that's just a small annoyance compared to having convenient boiling water."
3,It's ok,"The automatic turn off doesn't appear to work, which is irritating because at work I have to keep it on my floor (no extension cords allowed) and so if I'm not paying attention I don't know when it's done and it could just boil away... Also I've used it several times and the stinky smell hasn't gone away. I'm hoping that goes away soon. This seems a cheaper product than I thought it would be and I don't think it should be $30!"
4,Hot water fast,This was a great gift for my mother who is a huge hot tea drinker. She plans on taking this to her office! We like the auto shut off and quick heat features!
2,Disappointed for this purchase.,"Most items I bought from Amazon, I am satisfied with but not this electric kettle. The power button doesn't work, so I have to use something to press it and let it work, then after I saw water is boiling, I moved the thing I used to press and unplug. Disappointed with this purchase."
4,"Efficient, fast and reliable- I love it!","I live next to this water kettle in the winter. It is fantastic for making hot tea on a cold day. And, unlike my last kettle, I never have to worry if I walk away and forget about it. It shuts off automatically! I have one, my mom-in-law has one, and we've given it as a gift within the family. I highly recommend this item!"
3,A bit slow to shut off,"The kettle works OK, rather noisy, though, perhaps because the metal is somewhat thin, but the main criticism is that the automatic shutoff is slow to respond even with the top down firmly. We can hear the water bubbling longer than it should (compared to kettles we've had overseas, made in England) before it clicks off, which I don't like because I don't want my water to be flat. The gauge is a bit hard to read and not so accurate, but that is not important to me. In sum--it does the job but is not spectacular. Probably what you can expect at the lower end of the price range."
4,Lovely little teapot,"This kettle has replaced my stove-top kettle. Comfortable to lift and pour.The only complaint I have, hence the 4 stars, is that it doesn't make a noise louder than a soft click when it is ready, which means that sometimes I have to re-heat the water."
2,"works, but the design is disappointing","Purchased this for a 60-something woman who likes to boil water for tea and hot chocolate. The kettle does a great job of boiling water, but the kettle's design is not optimal. The window on the kettle body that shows how much water is inside is located underneath the handle, so if you are holding the kettle under a faucet it is difficult to look around your hand to see what the current water level is. And the flimsy plastic filter located just inside of the pour spout is difficult to properly align with its plastic housing, especially for someone who does not have strength in their fingers. After seeing this kettle being used by the person whom I purchased it for, I'd opt for a different kettle with a more thoughtful design and higher-quality materials if I were going to make this purchase again."
2,Has plastic inside,I had high hopes for this kettle. I loved the size and the looks. I've researched until I'm half-crazy for a plastic free electric kettle and I thought this was going to be it. BUT...the lid is plastic inside and there is a plastic holder for the plastic filter at the spout. I tried removing these and it will boil but will not turn off when the filter is not in place. I called the customer service number and spoke to someone who said the plastic is BPA free. Doesn't matter. Plastic can still leach out estrogen like chemicals. Had to send it back. HAS ANYONE FOUND A REALLY PLASTIC FREE (inside) ELECTRIC KETTLE?
5,"great kettle, very pleased with it","I have been looking for a way to make relatively large quantities of tea in something made of stainless steel (I am afraid of plastic/BPA/etc these days) and have been considering buying a samovar. A samovar, though, is rather expensive, and I decided to give this kettle a try. I am absolutely impressed with how fast it boils water (much faster than a microwave oven), and how long it maintains it warm after switiching off even though it is metallic. Tea making is now a breeze, the tea tastes excellent, the kettle is very convenient to use, I am giving it 5 stars, the concept/design is excellent, although I am not sure how long it will last (made in you-know-where, the place with huge reliability problems)."
2,tea kettle oops!,"The kettle looked very nice but was not efficient. The kettle took ages to come to the boil and to turn off. The ""On light"" was very difficult to see and the kettle too small. I would not buy this product again."
2,Will Break - Not good value,"For the price and the fast heating, it seemed good but ours broke in less than a year. We used it moderately, just the two of us, so it should have lasted better. Some of the other reviews say the same thing- it is made cheaply and breaks -- a trap for consumers, be warned."
4,"Great kettle, but louder than others","This is a great kettle. It heats fast and is very durable. I can't really add much to what the nearly 900 other reviewers have said.However, I do want to state that I found this kettle to be fairly loud compared to others that I have used. This is not really a significant problem unless you are brewing tea or coffee when company is over and the kettle is roaring in the background. Not a significant problem and would not keep me from buying another, but worth noting nonetheless."
2,Disappointed,"Unfortunately I bought this kettle as a gift for my brother and sister in law. After the first use, it failed to shut off when the water reached boiling point. Repeated attempts yielded the same result. The kettle will be returned. Needless to say, I am disappointed."
1,Mine leaks too,"Mine leaks, and it's getting worse with time. At first the auto shut off worked sporadically, but that problem resolved itself. I will be buying a new kettle because of the leak."
2,automatic shut off broke with in a week,"amazon is replacing- still a hassle. I had been warned by the negative reviews yet ordered it - so I was was kind of expecting it to break. The new one better work if not I write another review - far less ""positive"". Product otherwise looks good and boil the water in a timely matter (reason for 2 stars)."
2,No so good!,"I bought this product for 5 months, with two months is not bad, but then to die after the open water will not turn off automatically."
5,"I own 2: 1 for work, 1 for home!","I first got one of these as a christmas gift. I took it to work and it's been a part of our office kitchen nearly 2 years now. While it doesn't get heavy usage, we haven't had a single problem. No leaking and anything that other reviewers have mentioned. I liked it so much i bought one to have at home as well. It is super easy to use. Just fill it up, plug it in and turn it on. It only takes a couple minutes to heat up and it shuts off automatically when it's done."
1,Breaks under normal use,"After about 3 months, this product sprung a leak between the water chamber and the on/off switch. This shouldn't even be physically possible in a well designed product. My advice is spend the extra $10 and buy a kettle that actually works properly and doesn't carry an electrical shock risk"
2,Stopped working after 4 months of use,"This product worked fine for the first 4 months of use, boiling one pot of water, 5 days per week, then suddenly stopped working. Disappointed."
2,defective product,I got an Aroma Kettle about a month ago. It was working just fine for the first couple days but then it started leaking. A small rusty area occurred on the front side of the kettle. I returned the device and didn't ask for a replacement. I didn't want to get the risk o getting another defective product.
3,Works fine but has minor leaks,"This Kettle heats water pretty quickly although it's a little noisy. Well, I took the noise as a reminder that a pot of water was heating up, so it was fine with me. But after four weeks, there was white mineral deposit and rust accumulated at the bottom rim of the outer shining metal body. Obviously the seal isn't good and water leaks."
2,What could be wrong with a kettle?,"So, you are probably thinking... It is a kettle. What could be wrong with it.1. The light is so small that I have a hard time knowing if the kettle is on or off. Firs thing in the morning without my coffee is not that time I want to be x2 checking my appliances. If you look at the picture the red light is a tiny spec near the white branding.2. More importantly, it does not always shut off by itself. The last thing you want is a fire in your house--especially in the morning.3. BE WARY - Amazon will only let you return within 30 days....."
3,"Works well, but","The pot is a beauty, appearance-wise with a wonderful finish which can double as a mirror , if a somewhat distorted reflection one. It leaks , unfortunately , and has since it arrived . We use it anyway , as it works well otherwise and I hate the hassle of sending things which are not expensive , back."
1,Doesn't last!,"We've had two of these in the last 3 months. The first one started leaking less than a month after we started using it at the seam where the metal on the outside of the kettle meets the black plastic bottom on the kettle. We called Amazon and they shipped out a replacement. We've had that one now for about 2 months and it has started leaking at exactly the same place!Too bad, it works well (though is a bit loud) but if it doesn't last more than a month or two who cares how well it works or not?Terrible!"
1,A lot of defects,"What a worst product!I bought this product two weeks ago and got it quickly. After I boiled water, I find a lot of water leak to the base. First, I thought it might be due to some water drop in outside when I fill water . So I clean the water and this item with dry cloth. A few minutes, the water came out so I knew it is a leak. Then I requested a replacement. The replacement item also came quickly. I fill the water and leave it for a few minutes. This new one is also a leak one. How luck I were, get two, but both them leak water.Is this my bad luck? or Is this product a bad quality??(Leak water in bottom of it can cause electric shock, very dangerous)"
1,Leaks from the bottom of the handle,"I was happy that the entire vessel is stainless steel, hoping that plastic parts wouldn't crack with the heat. But, there is one hole near the bottom of the handle for the temperature sensor, I think. It leaked the first time I filled it with water."
4,So far so good,So far the kettle is great-it looks good. The problem I usually have with a pot is that it starts to leak after just a little while so I will see how this goes.
3,it's OK,It's just OK. nothing special.everything goes well as it's an electric kettle.heat fastthere is no odor even if the fist time use.
3,Cordless kettle,This is an ok kettle for the price. Good size and style. Periodically does not shut off when the water is boiling.
5,A Fast Heater,It boils water very fast and it is convenient due to the separable base design. Can't comment on the reliability since I have used it only lightly.
5,"Fast, good quality, big.","This thing holds plenty of water, heats up in about 3 minutes when completely full, and the detachable thing is awesome and seems robust. I'll probably be using this for years. Auto-off works nice too!"
5,HOT WATER KETTLE,"WE HAVE HAD SO MANY HOT WATER KETTLES OVER THE YEARS, BUT I KNOW FOR SURE, IF WE EVER NEED ANOTHER ONE WE WILL PURCHASE THIS ONE AGAIN! IT HEATS UP QUICKLY, AUTO SHUT-OFF,NO CORD TO WORRY ABOUT, PLUS I THINK IT'S ATTRACTIVE AND WILL GO WITH ANY DECOR"
3,good little pot when it works,"This is the second pot, first one was a gift. First one failed just out of waranty and symptoms where pot became hard to remove from base, and shortly there after it stopped heating. Being a guy who loves to take things apart to see why they failed, I found the base distorted caused the pot to make poor contact with the base connections and there was no way to fix it. During my investigation I was impressed by the design, construction and overall quality. For this reasonable price I was willing to give it a second chance. As I have only been using the 2nd one for a couple of months I'll let you know how it works a year from now."
5,Bought as Gift,My sister loves this item which far exceeds he original idea of a basic kettle. I would definitely recommend this purchase.
1,Don't Bother,"The power switch was floppy from day one, but hey it works right? Wrong! Less than 30 days and the power switch is broken. Also there are little tabs on the lid that make it extremely difficult to get open, I have no idea why they are there.I have an almost identical kettle at home that is a GE and that one is perfect no issues at all."
3,12 Month Warranty - Died in 11 Months,Product used about twice a day and lasted 11 months. Not worth it to have it sent to the manufacturer for their warranty as you have to pay for shipping and handling to and back. Ended up buying this again as other options didn't seem worth their price.
2,Worked great for 8 Months- Died in less than a year,"I purchased this kettle for my desk at work- worked great and looked great for 8 months. The out of the blue it smoked and stopped working. Much too short of a life for this product! I am trying another brand next time, I am soooo disappointed!"
1,Rusted with less than 1 month of use,"I have read the great reviews on this kettle and thought it would be great. However, it developed rust spots on the bottom within less than 1 month of use (water in it all day). I have used my roommate's GE electric kettle from walmart ([...]) and after 1 year with water in it allday/everyday, and I had no problem with rust in that one. So spend extra few $ and get that one from walmart. BTW, the GE kettle has a button to open the lid also."
4,Does what it says.,"I ordered this so I could make instant coffee at my work station.It heats up quickly and will stay hot for quite a while after it turns off (which is after it boils or you remove it from stand).The outside DOES GET HOT!! but this should be expected from a kettle unless the outside is insulated, but this isn't one of them.overall I like this kettle, it does what I need it to do and is simple and easy to use."
5,Hot Water Fast Fast Fast!,Love this electric kettle. Holds a ton of water...great to pre-boil the water for cooking pasta...so much faster than heating the water from room temp on the gas stove. Use it constantly for tea and making play dough and cooking pasta. Seems well made...will update this review once I get a sense of how durable it is :)
5,"Great kettle, even better price!","Wow, this kettle is pretty great. Holds a pretty large amount of water, and it boils so quickly. I was so amazed when I first tried it out. This definitely beats buying an ordinary stove kettle, and it is much safer also since it has an auto shut off. The price is excellent. The quality is pretty good. And the water doesnt taste funny.And a little icing on the top; I received this kettle 3 days before it was suppose to arrive. Fast and free shipping!"
4,Good overall,"For the price range this is a good kettle. It does not have an exposed heating element inside, which I like, and has a nice stainless steel look, although it is lightweight. My complaint lies in the automatic shut-off, which does not work. As long as you don't rely on the auto-shut off, this is a nice kettle for the price."
4,"Attractive, heats quickly, excellent customer service","This kettle is attractive and heats water very quickly. UPDATE: I got tired of its boiling fully for 3-6 minutes before automatically shutting off (at all water levels and with the lid tightly closed). When I called Aroma, they readily offered to send a new one after I emailed proof of purchase, without requiring me to send back the old one or pay the normal $8 warranty fee. And the new one shuts off more quickly. Good product, good company."
5,"So far, excellent!","Bought as a gift and got to see it in action recently. Super fast heating and very convenient to use- you can put the pot back onto the stand in any position, which some units don't allow. Build quality better than expected, especially in lieu of the price point. The competing pots are almost twice the price, but the reviews were great, so I went for it. When my current pot gives out, I'll get one of these for myself."
4,Great water kettle for the price,"Boil water fast, does what it is suppose to and for the price, this is perfect. No problem so far"
1,Very disapointed kettle,I bought this kettle based on good reviews on Amazon. However it didn't work in the way as it's supposed to. When I received it I immediately noiced two issues (of course I returned it to Amazon afterwards):(1)It won't (never) shut off automatically.(2)it leaks from somewhere close to the juction of its body and handle.That's it and I dont think there is any reason I should stand with these issues.
3,lets try one more time,"the first two kettles leaked water from bottom, and let the electrical base sit in a puddle of water. some water leaks from out of the switch area. i have returned two pots, and am trying a third one, because the pot is fast to heat, looks retro-cool, and is reasonably priced.i hope the issues with leaking pots has been solved by aroma. it seems like a fine product, but perhaps a few manufacturing runs slipped by the quality control."
1,manufacturing defects,"I used this item on a recent trip and liked it, but ordered two of these that came with the same problem--small cracks in the base that leaked. I gave up and bought a different brand at a local store."
1,it leaks,First kettle starting leaking on 2nd day. Its replacement leaked the first time I used it. Standing water and electricity appliances don't go well together.
2,FAULTY DESIGN,"I LOVE THIS POT. It is beautiful. Feels substantial without causing wrist strain and so easy to clean/wipe down. Fast to heat. I like it so much that I leave it on the counter....the counter that must always be clean of everything in my OCD world. Maybe the flaw is that I use it...alot. At about day 36 it started to leak right around the bottom where the stainless steel meets the black plastic bottom....there is no fix. It leaks. I have to protect every surface that it sits on, while drinking/using, every surface that I am ever to store it unless I empty it and dry it out..."
2,Nine great weeks then it started leaking...,"There are so many positive reviews on this kettle, I thought it would be fool proof. Such was not the case for me. I've loved this kettle up until a few days ago when I realized that water was leaking out the bottom of the handle and collecting around the electrical base. Amazon's policy states it can't replace or return the item after four weeks. It's been about nine weeks. Electric kettles should last longer than that, no? And Amazon should stand behind their products. Period."
3,"Does a decent job, but does not turn off automatically","I bought this kettle instead of a plastic one because I did not want hot water boiling in plastic. However, I was disappointed that this kettle does not automatically turn off and will boil forever if you're not watching it. And as another reviewer noted, keep this out of reach from little fingers as the exterior does become VERY hot. Otherwise, seems to work as described."
3,It's okay,"It looks pretty good and does the job just fine. However, it doesn't have a sturdy feel, and the exterior gets much hotter than other kettles I've had. Makes for a decent economy kettle as long as you remember to be careful. I wouldn't recommend it if there are kids around."
4,"Awesome tea kettle, one small issue","While this isn't 100% plastic free on the inside, it's very close and I frankly don't know of a model that is (please post in comments section if you know of one).Hence, I'm much happier with this than I was with my 100% plastic one which I only used as a water pitcher because of obvious concerns.This thing will take about 2 minutes to boil .6L of water. So, I cannot say that it's fast by any means.It's virtually maintenance free and is very stylish, however.My only complaint, one which I haven't figure out yet, is that if you filled it up with water and then dumped it (as I do into my water filter), and then proceeded to fill it up with filter water, the lid on this kettle begins to leak quite a bit water all over its side and onto the floor; I'm not sure how it manages to do this, but just a warning not to fill this thin up too much."
2,The outside gets hot enough to burn,"Unlike all the plastic models I've used, the carafe isn't insulated at all. When the water gets hot, the entire carafe gets hot. I've burned myself on it twice. Not impressed."
5,my breakfast maker,What a great AROMA hotpot!! I use it every morning to make my hot cereal and tea and love the fact that I am not heating up a plastic pot for my water!!I am making the change from plastic storage containers for food leftovers to glass and threw out my plastic hot pot and replaced it with this stainless AROMA.....one small step to rid my life of unhealthy plastic products!!!!
1,mine leaked,mine leaked out of the on/off switch. i left it on the counter with water in it after the first use and it dripped all over my counter. bit dangerous with the plug still plugged in.
3,Nice cordless water kettle,I bought this cordless water kettle as part of a wedding shower gift. The couple says it works well and is standing up to daily use.
3,its really LOUD!!,"I bought this because a friend of mine had one. Her's is amazing. Mine, not quite as amazing. I bought this one because it has a really modern look to it. Thought the other specs would be the same all around. Ya, mine takes a while to heat the water if there's a lot of water in it. To speed things along, we always just put enough water to fill 2 cups. Plus its so loud that if you are watching tv in the next room, you won't be able to hear what you're watching.I do like it, does the trick, but next time I'm going to ask my friend what brand she has, because although her's is plastic, it heats a full thing of water almost instantly while being really quiet at the same time. Mine is so loud I feel its about to take off into outer space!"
3,would not buy again,"I was not expecting the inside piece that comes with this kettle, inside the spout, to filter the water. My husband broke it off the first time he used the kettle, and perhaps for that reason, the kettle now does not shut off when it reaches the boil. Since that aspect was my main reason for buying this kettle, I am disappointed. I have used other kettles like this that are better."
4,Good product.,"The electric kettle was delivered promptly. It is really a very nice design. Looks good on the counter if you are going to keep it out. It works well for my elderly mother because it is light weight even when filled, and when pouring, the steam doesn't escape back on the hand holding the kettle. And it is REALLY fast. It is a little akward to remove the lid to fill it, but you can just pour water into the spout instead. I would buy another one."
3,Works well but rim of base oxidized,"Kettle has worked well as described for more than a year now. Metallic finish looks good, however if you spill water down the outside when filling it up then the water causes oxidation on the outside metal rim which separates the metal from the plastic. This spoils the esthetic effect and, I suspect, might corrode through eventually. If you are a more careful kettle-filler than I, this might be a non-issue."
5,Everything I hoped for,"I did a lot of shopping around (on the internet) before I settled on this electric, hot water kettle. I had read on other reviews for other products that the kettles leaked; I wanted to spend the money on a good, study kettle that wouldn't leak. I've had my kettle for about two months now and am very happy with it. There are no leaks (even when I accidently leave water in it for a couple of days). I like that the water heats up very quickly and that the kettle shuts itself off when the water is at a good rolling boil. For tea I usually pour the water before it even gets that hot. When I take the kettle off of its base, it automatically shuts off. I'm so happy with this kettle!"
4,GREAT TEA KETTLE,Would have given this 5 stars but does not shut off very quickly after coming to a boil (which it does very quickly). For the price this is a great kettle. We drink a lot of tea and this gives us boiling water rapidly. It also looks good sitting on the counter. I recommend it.
4,Gets the job done.,Pros: The look is great as it can be seen in the picture. Boils water in about 6 minutes. Has a decent capacity.Cons: The base is very light. The exterior gets extremely hot.
5,Works great as advertized,"I have had this for a month now; I use it every day several times a day, and it works great. Some reviewers complained that it did not shut itself off, but I have not had any problems like that. After the water boils for a few seconds, it always shuts off. It does exactly what you expect, works great, and no plastic taste. For the money, I think this was an excellent purchase, and, if I were in the market for another kettle, I would choose this item again."
3,Heavy kettle!,"Got this one to replace an older kettle on its last legs. The older kettle actually had a larger water capacity than this one, but I figured it wouldn't be that big of a difference. Well, it's a good thing this kettle doesn't hold any more water, because it is incredibly heavy to fill as is! Filling it with one hand gives me a pain in the wrist! I guess if you don't mind holding the kettle in one hand while you prop up the bottom with your other hand, then OK. If you have arthritis or just weak wrists and arms, better to avoid this one.Otherwise, I think it's nice to look at and no issues so far with heating. There seem to be a lot of negative reviews in relation to long-term quality, though, so I'll have to update after more use."
5,Love this Kettle,"I like drinking herbal tea throughout the day, so I bought this kettle for the office. It heats fast, but if I get busy and can't get to it when the water is ready, it turns it self off! I only use distilled water in the kettle, so haven't had to really ""clean"" it in the 4 years that I've been using it. When I don't want the water to actually be boiling, (some herbal teas are best at lower temperatures) I just take the kettle off the base before it starts to boil. Super easy to use and durable. I haven't used a better kettle!"
1,Broken on arrival,"I am pretty sad to say that this thing DOES NOT SHUT OFF automatically. It will just keep boiling violently enough that the unit will sway on its base. I am quite sure if left on its own it would tip itself over. A real safety risk. In addition, I note that it came with a small filter that is supposed to snap in place in the mouth but there is no bracket to hold it up - Perhaps I got a junk unit but I expect more from Amazon. Lesson learned is not to toss the box until you have used it for a week or two. For a water kettle I would go with a more reliable brand."
3,Sooo Depressing,"This book draws characters that are right on the mark. However, I had a hard time geting into the book because I kept looking for a plot. After I realized there was not going to be any plot, I began to appreciated the character development in the various vignettes.On the whole, I prefer a book with some moments of humor, some suspense, or some inspiration. The book is unrelentingly morose."
3,Not bad,good for research papers and stuff. dont get it just to read though coz it gets really boring
3,Where's the beef?,"It has been years since I have written any C code and I was hopeful that this book would give good ""working"" examples that included everything necessary to compile and test the code. If this was too much to include in the book, it could have been included in an accompanying disk. It seems that Mr. Gardner took the C reference manual and just elaborated on it slightly. The book could have been greatly improved by a tuturial chapter. After all, it was titled ""An introduction to programming the Microchip Pic in CCS C"". Worst of all, the book has no index.On the bright side, the book does have useful information which when added to other liturature written on the PIC line of micros, helps to educate."
3,For beginners only...,"This book is more an introduction to C programming than it's application in the PIC microcontroler. Some examples are given at the end concerning the pic's internal modules but they are short and lack substance and hints. Also, the're is no reference to the Hi-Tech compiler, only CCS."
5,"The perfect anatomy text for biology ""dummies""","As a student in a Masters Psychology program, I've found this text accessible, interesting, and easy to study. I've also Emailed the author twice with questions and heard back from him. This is the best textbook I've ever come across in 23 years of academia. Thank you, John Pinel!"
3,This book is okay but not very simplistic for some,The book has good graphics but without a backround of biology or science one must read it over and over again to understand
3,"Good, but could be even better","The ii-V section combining Dorian and Mixolydian is expecially helpful, but I think these exercises could have been done with even more structure and depth. Just the same, a good book for those looking for the basics..."
3,Please Play with My Tinky Winky!,"In the late 1990s, the late Jerry Falwell tried to talk bad about Tinky Winky. I decided to buy every Tinky Winky I could get my hands on in order to support my purple friend. This is one of the ones I bought. He is huggable and loveable, and durable! That toy has stood the test of time. I encourage all people, but especially us rainbow-flag men, to own one. It'll bring out the inner child in your friend of Dorothy. Plus, purple is the color of royalty, including queens."
1,RIPOFF,"I GUESS YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR, I COULD NOT GET MY KATANA CELL PHONE TO FIT NO MATTER HOW HARD I TRIED.I WOULD NOT BUY ANOTHER PRODUCT FROM THIS COMPANY."
3,Learn to Knit Vol. 1,I was expecting three lessons in the DVD. The box I had borrowed from the library had three. It was my fault that there was just one lesson and I was dissappointed.
5,Series ends with the best,"Guns, bombs, a major exposure of crime in politics - just an average day for the Gunsmith Cats. The third video, the closure of the first trilogy, lives up to the standard that the other two videos set. Rally and May are invited by the Mayor to a ceramony where he wants to present an award for their involentary help for taking down gun smuggling ring. Of course, their assasin is still alive and after them. City Hall's going to explode in more than one way in this third, action-packed video in the Gunsmith Cat series."
3,"Captured the essence of the comic book nicely, but...","I enjoyed this video very much; the voice actors were better than average (I have the English language version) and the ""buddy flick"" storyline moved along at an excellent pace. The addition of the BAT agent foil was a nice touch, and the villains were dead on for the genre.I was very disappointed in the drop of quality in animation in the third and final episode included on the tape. If the quality had remained consistent throughout, this would have been a Four Star effort.Nonetheless, I think I can recommend this collection to anyone who enjoys ""Gunsmith Cats"" or buddy flicks."
3,Kaytee Finch Feeder Sock,Sock works as designed... but gave it only 3-stars because 1) it has a draw-string/tie attachment which can be difficult to attach to feeder. You can get them with an elastic band at the top - MUCH easier to mount! And 2) they are relatively short. There are longer ones available. Get the longer ones... you don't have to refill them as often!
2,Too much $,"Amazon has since sent me ads for much cheaper finch socks.The on line description was somewhat confusing. I thought it was for 3 socks, but after (I received the order) reviewing I saw it was 3 in stock.I will still continue to use Amazon as I usually find it speedy and reasonable.ThanksRich"
4,Finally a new Robin Shou flick...,"Well i'll tell you the bad... The high light of this movie, Lost Time, is probably only about 20 minutes in length through out the whole movie. You get little 2 minutes teases of it through the film and only when the last 10 minutes hit do you get some decent story telling.The documentary part is interesting, but rather boring. You can't help but want it to speed up so you can see some more Lost Time.The special features are nice, but don't make up for this great delay we had. The CGI and lighting is terrible in Lost Time and is almost like watching some cheesey sci-fi channel show at times.Bottom line, if you're a Robin Shou fan get it, anyone else won't be that impressed though... In my opinion."
4,"My father was right, "" Canadian's"" have so much History.","It is so important that we never overlook what Canada has done in the past and Lynn Philip Hodgson made sure we will never forget the people of Camp X , Thank You Lynn a great read. T.V. Talk Show Host Dan Carter"
3,Made stomach ache,My doctor recommended I take these after a surgery I had. I can not comment on how well they worked because I took them in congontion with a few other products. My only comments are that they made my stomach hurt after taking them. Definetly eat something first. I ate a few crackers and it helped.
5,Uncensored Emotion,"This is art. On the surface it's about a group of theatre students who, out of patriotism, decide to seduce and murder a ruthless secret-police type political figure.While the students work as a team to get near him, it ultimately takes a woman, an actress and not a seductress, to get him alone and away from his bodyguards. Much of the power in this film derives from the dynamic relationship of these two, a union whose extremes and maturation are intimated in the sex scenes.Make sure you see this film as its creator intended, in the NC-17 version. What was cut was not cock and balls but minor truths, images like the serenity on a lover's face whose war has just been wiped away. These scenes, these moments, they drip with the stuff of life, they show us the feelings that sex can bring forth and allow the rest of the film to explore the responsibilities that we have to our emotions, that our minds have to our hearts."
5,This should be one best movies in movie industry,"This is the 1st time I ever wrote a comment in Amazon. This is because this moview is one of the best movie I ever saw, or the very best if I dare say. I don't like Ang Lee's movie very much, but this Lust and Caution made me believe that Ang is a great movie maker. Forget about lots of non-sense comments about the illogical plots or sexuality. If you don't have the deep thoughts and sensitivity, I don't think you know how to appreciate it. Otherwise, you'll never regret seeting a master piece!"
5,"Simply, the best!","This would be the best movie I have ever seen! There is a sensual and sexual tension which I did not find ""embarrassing"". A simple, and yet, superbly told and filmed story, with wonderful actors ( all seen for the first time) and positively brilliant direction from Ang Lee. It left me both moved , and somewhat haunted. I had to buy the book (with screenplay and shots from the movie) which is available from Amazon."
4,Great time period,"The plot of the movie was beautifully created and produced. The time setting in the 1930-40 was also impeccably duplicated with clothing and scenery. Ang Lee is true master of making movies. My one complaint is the overly emphasized sex scenes. I didnt think it was necessary. However, 10 years from now we may say he was a genius for doing what he did in this movie."
4,Great movie. Well transfered sad that no Blue Ray,"Yes. I like brief review.I saw this movie at the theater and already decided to buy Blue Ray disc and only DVD released. Too sad. But DVD quality is not bad. Sound and video both.The movie is one of Ang Lee's best, I might say.He is in his peak as a director, I guess."
3,Cautionless,"This movie was disappointing, it is set across time as you see an innocent girls transformation into a harlot. Dispite the great reviews of a beautiful storyline, this movie was very slow. Although it had beautiful scenery plots took to long to develop. I have to say it was a beautiful story is just could have been told alot better. This movie was long winded even to individuals who love Chinese dramas."
4,Spy Thriller,The newspaper article in the local paper wrote the actress Tang Wei reportedly was ban in her home Country by Officials. I have not yet viewed DVD but the movie comcept is good based in the War years of WW2.
3,Interesting,"Fine acting at an old fashioned pace. There is power here. As she is being violated, the woman turns and looks at her attacker in one of the most powerful and telling scenes in film. Lots to like. Just couldn't buy the ending."
1,lust caution,I wish this film had some editing. It moved way to slowly. I also found the characters to boring to care about.
2,"Caution, a whole lotta mah jong","Ponderously, the movie lasts for a 2 plus subtitled hours (unless you understand Chinese), but it felt more like 6 hours. The story takes place over a period of 4 years and it almost seemed like I was watching it in real time. The story is not very convincing and kind of dumb actually, but to Ang Lee's credit it is fairly well told. The acting is pretty good and the visuals are excellent. I especially liked the street scenes of WWII time Shanghai (or whereever that was supposed to be). But my advice to most of you is rent a travelogue or documentary about China and an Asian porno and you'll get what you came for without the tediously uncredible story."
1,Feel bored and disgusted at the same time.,"Watching an old man first rape (or pretend rape) then have explicit sex with a young woman made out to be innocent and inexperienced.Then having the woman betray her friends to help the guy she's suppose to kill.It just leaves this overwhelming feeling of disgust.It's based off of a book a woman wrote, so if this is really how women think? Makes me feel a bit depressed.Unless they used advanced CG, the torrid sex scenes seem to be real, and we can't even pretend that it's just a movie. The old greasy man is really having sex with the 20 year old (which wouldn't even be that bad if the writer/director hadn't set her up as an inexperienced virgin at the beginning).The movie is 2.5 hours long, with drawn out, unnecessary scenes that neither builds plot or reveal characterization. No real tension is built either. So it's a boring long disgusting movie."
5,Deep movie meaningful,"It touched me so much! This movie is Ann lee's best one to me. It has lots of deep meanings about love between lovers , life , history, love to the country... It' a deep movie. No wonder he cried many times during the shooting..."
3,"Lust, Caution","I have mixed feelings about this movie. It was well acted and had an interesting storyline. There was a lot of hype about the sex scenes being extremely erotic. I found them a little mechanical and ridiculous, to be honest, especially when they went on and on and on with absolutely no realistic passion from either party. The positions became laughable to me and the person with whom I was watching. Not my favorite and not even a turn-on. Sorry."
5,Great film!,Saw it in the theater and had to own it. the story is a marvel and the female lead is so intensely beautiful. Great film.
3,a dish best served cold,"I have to admit I did not read the original story this movie based on.With that aside, I find this movie ending very "" disturbing "".May be Mr. ang lee do not want to excrcise too much artistic freedom ( ala that Demi Moore's Scarlet Letter fiasco ), but a director's cut is in order with alternate endings.1. The bad guy died in hails of bullets......happy ending but no depth.2. The bad guy and girl died in hails of bullets..... better ending, it shows girl died for country and "" love/lust "" .3. Final scene shows girl playing mah-jong with ring on finger..... best ending, total betrayal of country and submission to love/lust.As it is now, it's like a dish that's once great but a bit cold..... something is missing and it's not a good feeling."
2,Sexual Espionage Gone Awry,"Set mostly in World War II Shanghai, director Ang Lee's follow-up to ""Brokeback Mountain"" is an overlong, ambivalent journey into Chinese sexual espionage. Lee aims for an epic grandeur that clashes with the traditional spy thriller - minus the sharp pacing inherent in the genre. Strong performances, impressive period detail and Rodrigo Prieto's mesmerizing photography cannot redeem the plodding narrative. By the time ""Lust, Caution"" reaches its downbeat conclusion, the dramatic impact has been dissipated."
3,"Somewhat interesting, but ultimately disappointing","Other reviewers have summarized the storyline, so I will not repeat what they said. I did not find the film to be especially historically accurate. The ""Shanghai"" sets seemed too immaculate, even in the colonial concession areas. The Japanese troops are essentially props or backdrops.For some reason, Ang Lee does not portray the very cruel, violent side of the Japanese invasion and occupation of much of China between 1931 and 1945. The resistance figures, especially when they are in Hong Kong, are patriotic, but generally incompetent.The storyline was generally predictable and not particularly suspenseful. I think too much comment has been made by many reviewers about the explicit sex scenes, which seem somewhat unusual for a Chinese film.Overall, I think the movie is somewhat interesting, worth watching once, but disappointing in lacking strong heroic figures."
4,Very intense and heavy,"Japan is occupying Shanghai. A young woman is part of a resistance group. She is going deep undercover to find the chance to assassinate a secret intelligence agent. She gets in to deep. The danger is deadly. A plot that is years in the making could be foiled with the tiniest discrepancy.This movie is very graphic. It has a few very rough sex scenes that are borderline rape. The movie is pretty well done a far as the script, and acting are concerned. The costumes, and set are also very beautiful. The movie was produced very well. It's a long movie, and feels like it's dragging at times. Despite that it does keep you wanting to know what is going to happen next. I think it's a great movie, but maybe not one you are gonna watch more than once. It's a little too depressing for that I think."
4,great history as well as lust and caution,"This is not just an erotic film as most reviewers seem to think. It is also a most interesting historical movie about the Japanese occupation of Shanghai before and during WW II.Yes, the emotions and lust take the front of the stage most of the time, but I was attracted to the historical setting. Collaborationists in Japanese occupied China facing agonizing struggles between survival and conscience. Their realization that all is lost after the American intervention in the war following Pearl Harbour is painful, but they have nowhere to go. Also the idealistic but amateurish youth in the heroic resistance movement are given the credit they deserve.As for the lust and love part, I agree with most reviewers: it is a great movie, digging deep into human weaknesses. Both protagonists neglect their political duties to pursue their lust. Caution, in the end, is not enough..."
5,"Suspenseful, Hot & Enjoyable",A very amazing & complex movie - superbly and coolly acted. I'm happy to recommend it and will probably watch it again.
4,"Lust, Caution movie : predictable outcome","Thrill, suspense, good acting are a plus.Tumultuous sex scenes and the large gift emphasizethe resulting love and pity, especially due to the longduration of the plot ( three years make a spya true wife ). A dramatic ending.Morality : never use young inexperienced studentsto perform a monumental task. They are no match totheir evil counterpart. Be flexible, change plans,bring in bigger guns. Anyway: this is good entertainment."
1,"Caution:Boring,Slow","This was a very slow moving,boring and dull story.The sex scenes are not hot at all unless you are into the coma sutra and even then. I was very disappionted with this movie thats all I can say."
5,"Atmospheric, believable, utterly absorbing","This is a compelling story of complex relationships set during the Japanese occupation of China during the Second World War. Some newspaper reviews have lingered on the violence and graphic sex that illustrates the plot but that demeans the subtlety of the storytelling and the amazing performances by all the actors involved. The director builds and sustains the tension throughout the movie, while pulling off the complicated trick of making his characters human even while involved in inhumane acts. Violence is described rather than shown and the viewer gets a keen sense of the overwhelming pressure involved in leading the secret agent's double life. Not for the faint-hearted, but a highly intelligent and thought-provoking film.Ride with the Devil"
4,Sexually Provocative & Highly Charged Drama/Espionage Film,"Ang Lee does a wonderful job once again in making a wonderfully interesting film that captures your attention from the get go and holds it throughout the entire film. I like the fact that Lee's films aren't boring, nor predictable and also done in a tasteful and artistic manner.The acting is well done, along with the storyline, costuming, sound quality & cinematography.... The music used in the film is also nice. Highly recommend this film if you are an Ang Lee fan or just want to watch a film that isn't mainstream Hollywood."
3,Predictable,"I've read all Cheryl Holt's books save ""Sleeping with the Devil"". No doubt her sex scenes are steamy but varies little from book to book. Her heroes are always rakes with plenty of experience and her heroines are always 25-26 year old virgin spinsters. The plots could use some sprucing up. Doesn't really measure up compared to other writers in her genre in terms of romance."
3,okay,This is one of my favorite authors. But this book would not be my first choice of her books. It gets a little slow in the middle. Which is unlike Cheryl Holt. I love her as an author. I would suggest one of her other books like... Total Surrender! That is one of my favorite erotic historical romance novels.
1,Crapped Out After 15 Minutes,"After looking on the Delco website and checking the listing for this pump I bought it to install on my 78 GMC 454 truck. Being an inline pump, installation is as easy as it gets, and I also installed an inline filter just before this pump. My first test drive was a let down because the engine hesitated and cut out several times over the course of 20 minutes. Back at home, I pulled the fuel line and found that the pump was only dribbling gas. I replaced it with a Carter pump and all is good now. It could be that I received a defective pump, not sure, but I wasn't taking any chances with a replacement Delco.Also, the pump photo on Amazon is not correct. The EP12S has one 3/8"" nipple on each end and has + and - leads for hookup."
3,The Titanic: Lost and Found (Step into Reading),The book is way to easy for me. I read it in about 20 minutes. My baby brother can even read it easily.
5,"A very easy to understand, yet accurate story of the Titanic","This book tells the story of the Titanic in an easy to understand format for young readers, yet is very accurate. My four-year old son absolutely loves this book. I have looked at many books on the Titanic for his age level and this is the best one I have found."
3,"Lots of photos, but...","It's true what the cover promises: the guide shows a lot of places and things, much more than the other guides I've bought. However, it's much less detailed than these same other guides - the Lonely Planet, for example.If you are planning to travel, I would recommend at least two or three guides. Comparing and crossing information is the best thing to do, and the photos in this book will definitely help."
4,Eyewitness to Sweden,"Our daughter has traveled to Sweden frequently to visit the homeland of her dear husband. We would love to do this too, one day, but for the present we can only read about it. This book has been a wonderful way to plan our dream trip, and also give us an insight into the beauty and customs of this wonderful Scandinavian country. It is easy to read and has wonderful pictures.The index is helpful and it is organized in an appealing format. Thanks!"
4,perfect,"It is a nice book if you are travelling. It consists all important places to be visited, and also gives advices especially to be seen at/in that important places. Moreover it gives detailed informations(history, daily life/situation, stories about them. Also including opening and closing hours and how you can reach to that places, which are always true.)Maps of the books and addresses are also very helpful.I also bought the books of Eyewitness Travel Guides, for the countries or the the cities I went.In addition to the books, the service quality of Amazon was amazing, I had a very limited time to buy and get the books. The people were very concerned about my problem, I got my books on time."
3,"adequate for background, but I wouldn't take it with me (again)","All of the eyecandy we expect from eyewitness guides. Some once-over-lightly background (not what I'd call in-depth) - most useful, from this perspective, as a decision tool before you've decided to go. Look elsewhere for real help in planning."
1,poor quality,this bookcase came with several parts broken or needind regluing/renailing. It really was a piece of junk.
2,warning about Winsome Wood products in general,"I bought a Winsome Wood table in May. The table top was broken in shipment. The replacement was damaged too. Three months later they finally sent a third top. I assembled the table and the guides for the keyboard tray are bent.Regarding this bookcase. The parts are not cut and drilled precisely. I will have to sand down several surfaces just to make the parts fit together so that the assembly can be completed. As it is now, one of the side slats will not fit into the groove because other parts stick out too far! For inexpensive furniture Sauder is your best bet by far."
2,Not a good value,"This unit looks nice once assembled and as easy to assembly. A socket wrench equipped with a hex bit speeds assembly greatly as the allen wrench provided is a SLOW way to screw in the many allen head screws that hold the unit together. I think the material is cheap and mine actually had a factory pre-assembly glue mistake on one of the shelves that did not stop me from assembling, but makes one of the shelves unlevel. It looks Ok when completed and seems fairly sturdy, but is not as sturdy and well executed as it should be for the price. If this was $40-$50, I would rate it higher."
3,Winsome Wood Toscana 3-Tier Bookcase - Honey Maple,The product is true to it's description. It came with average instructions. One of the shelves has a gap from the shelf to the side wall. The piece is so lightweight that it feels like it needs to be anchored to the wall so that it won't fall over. It's an average piece of furniture and not worth what I paid for it.
5,Exciting music connects us with ancient music of the Bible,"I was very excited to hear this music. I have always been curious about what the Psalms sounded like at the time of their writing and now we have a chance to hear an educated guess based on ancient notations. Anyone who enjoys vocal music, chants or Venetian Renaissance would also enjoy this recording. Track 3, ""The Earth is the Lord's"" and track 9, ""Praise ye the Lord"" are particularly wonderful."
2,"WELL DIRECTED, POORLY CAST & SCRIPTED","Ben Bolt is a capable director, and the here he does a good job - with everything but his lead actor. The music is wonderful, just enough to make your spine tingle. The problem here is Jodhi May. She turns in a endlessly one-note performance. She seems to be focussing so hard on not ever blinking, while her mouth is perpetually agape. Mr Bolt must be to blame for this, because she certainly seems a decent actor. Nonetheless, her performance drags this interesting production down into the realm of a cartoon. Unfortunate, for the children and housekeeper - and ghosts - are solid supporting cast. The script also is awkward and at times clumsy. I suspect the other reviewer is correct in ideally wanting to hear this story read by firelight - either 100 years ago, or perhaps tonight."
4,Quality Masterpiece Theater Production,This version of Henry James's famous ghost story is well rendered and keeps the storyline while adding some subtle (or not so subtle) insight in to the mind of the unnamed governess. Knowing the plot quite well I did not find the movie particularly scary but for someone unfamiliar or who hasn't read the book in awhile there could be some real chills. And as is so often true in ghost stories the more the movie shows of the spirits the less frightening they become and the viewer gets some real good looks at both Peter Quint and Miss Jessel. Just like in James's novel the transformation of the children and the ambiguity of the whole thing causes the most spine tingles.
1,"Watch ""The Innocents"" w/Deborah Kerr instead","Jodhi May plays the same role in every movie. It's as though she's brain damaged or something, vacant stare and mouth open. One almost expects her to drool. The Innocents, upon which The Turn of the Screw was based, is bone chillingly scary. No real special effects, just good acting, directing and dialogue. Avoid this adaptation and watch The Innocents instead."
1,Was so dissapointed,Man I was dissapointed in this film I love Johi May and Colin Firth but this was a waste of money and the end was not very clear and the movie was rather depressing.
1,DIED AFTER TWO MONTHS,BOUGHT THIS TO REPLACE A 15 YEAR OLD SEARS CHARGER THAT I USED TO CHARGE MY BASS BOAT BATTERIES. IT WORKED FINE FOR ABOUT TWO MONTHS AND THEN DIED. DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE A CHANCE ON A SECOND ONE SO I PURCHASED SCHUMACHER SHIP N SHORE. I'VE HAD MINN KOTA TROLLING MOTORS IN THE PAST THAT WORKED JUST FINE SO I WAS DISAPPOINTED WHEN THIS CHARGER DIED SO QUICKLY.
3,This is just a charger !!!!! Not a power supply.,"This is a charging station to charge your battery. This is not a power supply.You have one end with 120v (your regular house-hold electric socket) and the otherend with red and black clamps (as you see in the product photo). You clamp your battery according to red and black color and plug it into the socket for a recharge. This product recharges your battery and that's it. The display lights show you whether your battery is ""charging"" or ""charged"". I made a mistake of thinking that this product can also be a power source (when recharged again) so I can use carry it on my boat in case my battery dies out and let the battery to draw power from it."
4,Very cool music,"His music is cool, it's fun and you can enjoy a martini or a glass of red wine whithout loosing your beat."
4,Amazing Cars,"This book is truly amazing. If you are an old ""real"" car collector or just love these timeless treasures you need to buy this book. Everything was so organized and easily found. This book had such wonderful detail, you'll be at a loss for words. No matter what the age this book will be enjoyed by all young and old. It's a classic."
4,Really Enjoyed This!,"Fred Carver isn't your typical Adonis private eye, maybe that's why I enjoy this series so much? He's human, the kind of person you'd like to drink a beer with. John Lutz does a wonderful job at drawing the reader into Fred Carver's world, I found myself laughing out loud, cringing, and wishing that the book wouldn't end. I've read all the books in this series, if you start with the first there is a lot of background information that (gratefully) isn't repeated in subsequent books."
4,Great book for undergrads,"Took a physio course and this was required. I aced that class by reading this book very carefully. The writing is not terribly dry like some textbooks, although don't expect anything thrilling either! The graphics, I thought, were what really helped me understand the steps and processes. Therefore, if you're truly a graphic learner, I'd recommend this. If I had to make a complaint, it'd be that the author and editors should add more pictures. Also, this is most likely for undergrads/ beginners...not health professional students."
1,much ado about....?,"I stopped reading after the first two stories. Intriguing ideas for a short story collection, and great cover, but poorly executed. The writing is not engaging - at times convoluded and cofusing - and no real connection with the characaters or their plights. The dialogue seemed contrived, and I found myself thinking that people don't really speak the way characters did in this book. Granted, I only made it through 88 pages, but I was comfortable in using that as a prediction for the rest. I'm with a lot of other reviewers here - I don't quite understand all the praise/awards for this work.Now, for much more engaging and genius short story writing, check out KELLY LINK. Especially MAGIC FOR BEGINNERS. Nearly perfect. Also, MOTHERS AND OTHER MONSTERS, by Maureen F. McHugh. What short stories should be.I'll be selling Twilight back to my bookseller. I wonder if the author would be more engaging with essay writing?"
2,From a math major . . .,"About 20 pages into the first short story I could not tell people what this book was about. And I could not really tell at the end either. Yes it was a contrast of before and after 9/11 (in NYC). And for a short time their seemed to be comic like super heroes, which I was thinking the main characters might turn into somehow. Instead it returns to describing 4 characters who must move out of a flat because the orginal tentant is returning. In fact that seems to be the techinque to keep interest and the pace of the story up - introduce more and more characters, cleverly deescribing them in a few words, and their interaction with the others until I was lost.This might be more the cup of tea though of an English major, but I don't plan on finishing this book."
1,"Random, hard to follow",This book was not easy to read. In fact I only read the first 36 pages trying to follow the story. It was like reading random thoughts of mumbo jumbo. The cover was cute and the author sounded interesting. I just didn't get it....
3,Everything Happens At The End,"Like other Louis L'Amour books I have read, everything happens at the end. The first couple of sentences had me: ""I was two days out of coffee and one day out of grub, with an empty canteen on my saddle horn."" I wanted to keep on reading. But not much happens in the first 100 pages. Lots of gathering cattle, slow building of a cowboy mystery. There is no gunfire (aside from sniping) until almost 200 pages in. If I had to read this again, I would count the number of times L'Amour identifies trees: cedar, mesquite, oak, elm, pecan... He had a thing for trees.An okay book, but don't look for non-stop action."
4,"Rosi is not that bad. -(Baby Deepa, 28 months old)","I am 28 months old and a little further along in my pottie training than baby Tiffany. I would simply like to echo the sentiments of my fellow toddler, Tiffany. I also loved John Stewart and all of the musical numbers.I must, however, take exception with baby Tiffany's characterization of Rosi O'Donnel's interaction with children as ""unnatural"" and ""forced"". Ever since I began to eat solid foods, I have always felt that Rosie's extremely outgoing demeanor, while certainly annoying, was always genuine. And besides, with the video, you can simply fast-forward thru her appearances."
2,Too sophisticated for an Elmo-lover - Toddler,"The video tries to hard to be trendy and looses focus on the simplicity of Sesame Street/Elmo's World. Elmo appeals to toddlers and it lacks simple music and movement to keep their attention. The segments have sophisticated jokes for adults and contain celebs that are already ""has-beens'. It is also over-produced and the clever lyrics are lost on little ears."
1,Inappropriate for young children,"The show starts off good until the first group comes on. These songs are not the typical Sesame Street/Elmos World songs. My 2 yr old was scared at the first ""rap"" song. It was a very ""in your face"" loud song. She loves Elmo & we were very disappointed that he was hardly in it. They like the puppets & they weren't seen much at all either. The majority of the videos and how they are performed are not for the young viewer. They never want to watch it & I don't want them too. I wish I could return it. The worst $20 I ever spent."
1,No Fun!,"My daughter and I are both big Sesame Street fans, and both of us were disappointed by this video. She's three, and I think it just bored her. Too many adults, not enough puppets. One of the things that bothered me was that most the people in the video seemed very angry. I know that sounds strange....but, well,it was strange. Especially for Sesame Street."
3,Prefer the CD,"Good music, but the linking segments are weaker, and didn't appeal well to my daughter. Also, short on Elmo, despite the title. The end segment, a best-of-Sesame Street songs segment stands out, and isn't on the CD. We end up skipping the links and going directly to the songs."
2,Not good for younger children,Don't get this if your toddler likes to be entertained. This is better for older children although if I could I would easily return this video. I thought it was very boring
2,Not the best,"Not so good. Seems to be geared more to adults, but completely annoying. My daughter would occasionaly watch, but there are MUCH better Elmo videos out there. My son won't watch it at all."
2,Bogus Elmo Video,"The songs on this video are entertaining. But for the parent of an 18-month-old who wants to actually watch Elmo in action, the video is disappointing. Elmo plays a small role in the video. It would be great to see much more of Elmo actually singing."
5,MUSICLICIOUS,"WE ALL LOVE THIS VIDEO. IT IS NOT ONLY FOR CHILDREN, BUT ADULTS AS WELL. IT IS ONE OF FEW VIDEOS SHE WILL WATCH FOR SHE IS NOT A TV FAN. KEEPS HER ENTERTAINED WHILE I GET DINNER READY. ITS A MUST HAVE IN MY OPINION!!!!"
2,Not a good Elmo movie.,"I got this movie for my 18 month old twins since they like Elmo and love the ""Kids Favorite Songs"" DVD. Unfortunately, Elmo is barely in this movie and there is more non-singing/dancing material than there is singing/dancing material. Too much time is spent trying to get a dressing room door unlocked. My kids lost interest after 2 minutes. If I show it to them now, I have to ""fast-forward"" to all the dance and song routines. And even some of them are kind of boring. Shawn Colvin and Kenny Loggins for 2 yr olds? Not very exciting."
3,Might be better for older kids -- my husband & I liked it though,"We got this DVD for our 18-month old and he just isn't that interested in it. Not much to engage a young toddler, especially since Elmo doesn't make many appearances nor does my son's favorite, Cookie Monster. My son much prefers the Elmo DVD about babies and animals. Or he also likes Elmo Loves You. This DVD though is fun for adults who are Jon Stewart and Chris Rock fans."
1,Too much Rosie,We were disapointed to see this video had very little of Elmo and a lot of Rosie O'Donnell. It really didn't keep me son's attention - and when Rosie broke into song - my son broke into the other room. His other Sesame Street video Let's Make Music keeps him interested even after 40+ veiwings. Elmopalooza lost his interest the first time he saw it.
2,Music with Elmo/Sesame Street as an afterthought,"After owning/renting numerous Elmo and Sesame Street DVDs, this seemed to be among the more disappointing because:- Elmo barely appears in this video- The artists play/sing with little interaction with the characters.- Very few songs were catchy and kept my son's attention- Who said that Rosie O'Donnell could sing???This title sounds like a fun video...but it's not."
2,Might want to skip this one.,"I thought the production was quite cute, but it absolutely doesn't interest my 18-month-old daughter. The amount of time between the muppet appearances is not enough to hold her attention and there are far too few Elmo appearances for her taste! Minimal educational value as far as I can see."
2,Not for small kids,My daughter is 10 months old and I bought this video because she loves Elmo. She has Elmo in Grouchland and doesn't take her eyes off the TV when it's on. I bought this thinking she would enjoy it as much but this video is for older kids. It doesn't hold her attention at all except when Elmo or any of the puppets appear. Maybe she'll enjoy it more in a few years.
1,Incredibly BAD!!!,"Let me start by saying our son is a big Elmo fan, and we think ""The Best of Elmo"" is tremendous.This DVD starts VERY VERY VERY slowly...and gets worse and worse and worse. The opening segment takes forever to get through and offers nothing to keep your child's attention or your attention. When the music finally starts, it is disappointing beyond description. Our son hated it, we hated it, and returned it after 1 abbreviated viewing. This DVD has nothing to offer for anyone in any age bracket."
4,Kinda Hip for Kid Vid...,"...we also agree that Rosie is a bit toooo much for this prime time Sesame Street outing, but, that's okay because, things like Chris Rock bantering with Oscar the Grouch, and the Fugees jamming with Big Bird and the Mayor of Margaritaville literally kickin' it with Kermit and the Amphibians, and tunes from the Mighty Mighty Bosstones, and Shawn Colvin (not to mention Muppets' two straight men in this, the sardonic Jon Stewart and the always funny David Alan Grier) makes this a show that most parents and grand parents don't mind watching with the youngsters....a musical, magical 55 minutes of fun."
3,Good for grown-ups,"While my husband and I find this video entertaining, it's too grown-up for my 15-month-old. The beauty of Sesame Street generally is that it intersperses adult humor (via adult references) with children's entertainment. This video seems to contain more of the former than the latter. There is too much human dialogue and not enough song and dance to keep my daughter's interest for long. Maybe she'll appreciate it more in a few years, but for now, it's more appropriate for mommy and daddy."
2,More like MTV for toddlers than sesame street,"I just rented this video for my 14 month old daughter. I was disappointed with the 4 dollars I spent on it for that. It is more like a music video than a story. The segments are of adults, no children singing or playing and the story line isn't much. Sure my daughter swayed along with the music but there wasn't anything educational about this video and I am so glad I didn't buy it. I really limited my daughters exposure to tv and this was the first video we ever left her watch and now I'm sorry that we did even that. Stick with the sesame street tv program or prescreen other dvds before you buy. I hope this helps you from being as disappointed as we were."
2,Love Sesame Street - but not this one!,"My son (17 months) picks up and asks to watch the DVD/Video he wants. We own 7 different Sesame Street videos and this is the only one he has never asked to watch again and actually walks away from it when it is on the TV. That is the main part of the review. As to why?, probably because the songs are not so catchy for young kids, even though the preview on the other tapes makes Elmopalooza appealing. I was suprised by the quality, usually Sesame Street is synonymous with an excellent product. Although I did like the Rosie number and it is Sesame Street, so I gave it two stars. If your child loves to dance and hear music try Sesame Street's Count 'Em 1-2-3, I think we've played it over 100 times already!"
5,My kids have enjoyed this for years!,"I have a ten year old and twelve year old that enjoyed this video very much for its variety. Now, I have a five year old who enjoys the same music and fun play that my other two children enjoyed years ago. It isn't old Sesame Street, but it is puppets having fun to clean music."
3,"This is a music video, not an Elmo video","If you are buying this video for your little Elmo fan, think again. Elmo hardly appears at all; it's mostly popular groups singing songs with a few muppets thrown in. I think it's a good video, but it's not really at my 12-month-old son's level. He wants non-stop Elmo action, not people singing. This might be better for the 4-6 year old crowd."
2,This video just didn't cut it for us.,"My child LOVES Elmo. She will sit for an hour and watch Sesame Street or any Elmo video. But this one just bored her to tears (literally!).The idea behind this video is good. However, kids do not know who the celebrities are and, frankly, they couldn't care less. As soon as the puppets disappeared, my child would lose all interest. I can see an older child enjoying this more, but I wouldn't recommend it for kids under 2.Instead, I recommend Elmo's World videos, especially the Babies, Dogs, and More one."
1,Don't waste your money,"If you think this is another Sesame Street tape, you're wrong. There's almost nothing in this tape that has to do with Sesame Street or Elmo. I played this once and haven't played it again. It is made for MTV fans not Sesame Street fans, and it certainly is not for infants and toddlers. I was really disappointed."
3,It's okay. I think I liked it more than my son.,It is a little slow at moments and it doesn't always keep my little boy's attention.
1,Rent it Before You Buy It,"Our family has an embarassingly large collection of Elmo and Sesame Street DVDs, so I speak from experience... I found this production to be way below par. My 2 1/2 year old son picked it out at the video store and we got through maybe :10 minutes before he volunteered to turn it off and do Play-Doh instead. The plot if poorly contrived, the production value is low, the acting for the most part is awful, and it's basically just a way to stitch together a series of music videos which at his age, my son has no interest in. He did like the part where the muppets try to break open the dressing room with a jack hammer. But I'm not buying the video for a 12 second clip. Better bets: A Celebration of Me, Grover or Sesame Street: The Street We Live On."
1,Major disappointment,"Okay, my wife and I couldn't stand it, but my child, who loves Elmo, couldn't sit through it. Thank heavens for fast-forward. By the way, who ever told Rosie she could sing?"
2,Not good,"This video doesn't entertain or captivate my children like the other Elmo videos we love(Best of Elmo, Wild West, and Adv. in Grounchland). Don't waste your money on this one."
2,Dated and disappointing,"Our toddler loves Elmo, and loves all the musical numbers on Sesame Street. We were looking for something that would just focus on the Sesame Street songs and videos so we wouldn't have to fish through a whole episode of Sesame Street to find them one song at a time. This video only slightly accomplishes this.It's a cute little show. It is quickly obvious that it aired on TV in the 90s. It's littered with B-list celebs with some comical appearances from those who fell off the face of the earth and a few young versions of those that are still around. There is lots of filler, and the songs are just Okay. This has all the merits of what should be free content, so my 2-star score is relative to paying $10 for the streaming/download version. Don't pay for it unless you really really really need some on-demand children's music videos. Free content is generally equal to better quality...this is just slightly more convenient."
2,Not for the usual Sesame Street/Toddler set,"Although the bumbling story line of mishaps would certainly please the toddler crowd, the majority of songs and how they are performed are not for the young viewer. (Some of the song titles such as ""Be Yourself"" and ""Mambo I, I, I"" might tip you off - when have you NOT known a toddler to be him/herself? Why would the mambo specifically [""it's not the cha-cha or the tango""] hold the interest of a three-year-old?) There are moments here and there that are appropriate and appealing to youngsters, however, this production seems like it couldn't make up it's mind deciding whether to appeal to toddlers or their pre-adolescent siblings."
5,perfect photo album,"This, for me, is the perfect photo album. It is not too heavy yet it is not flimsy. The qualigy is good. The basic black is suitable for almost any photo collection. The size is ample, at least for me. I am very pleased with my purchase."
5,GREAT!,GREAT PRICE GREAT FOR ANY ARTIST MAKEUP ARTIST HAIRSTYLIST OR ANY ART MAJOR WANTING TO DISPLAY THERE WORK. I USED THIS FOR A JOB INTERVIEW AND GOT THE JOB & ALSO GOT COMPLIMENTED ON HOW PROFFESIONAL THE PORTFOLIO APPEARED.
3,Used for photography class,I used this for my photography class. It works for that. do not think it will last a long time
4,A good item for the price.,"This is a really good item. It is sturdy perfect for a photographers or models portfolio. The only thing I would change is around the edge of the portfolio there is a border sewed around the it, it looks alright but at the end there's a little clump of material, that's a little annoying. But out of all the ones I have ordered this one is definitely the best."
5,excellent value!,Great product. Simple but elegant & durable. Matches everything it sits by. Thanks for great product & description. Will definately buy again!
5,Great for Photos!,"Got this in addition to the smaller size (5x7) for keep my son's professional portraits in order (school, birthday, holiday, etc). I ordered one for myself, my mother and my mother-in-law. These have been SO handy! I've already filled mine up and need another! Pages are sturdy and keep everything organized and clean. Lightweight, so I can travel with it no problem.Great and would certainly recommend to anyone looking for a place to house their photos. :)"
4,Great for what I needed.,"For the price, these portfolios are exactly what I needed. I needed something rather cheap (no leather-bound, thick protection sleeves) that I could put some of my best prints in to show people interested in checking out samples of my work. I wouldn't use these as a college portfoio personally, though I'm sure that'd be completely acceptable - but if you're looking to store photos or artwork to have people flip through quick to get an idea for what you're all about, these Itoya portfolios are the way to go."
3,little messy,We love the product but this shipment was a little messy. Apears the seal leaked a little but it cleaned up easily and will probably order again
2,Technically not a DVD player,"This player did play DVD-R, -RW, and +RW (I didn't have a +R to try), but not well. It kept dropping frames (that is, the video would pause and then skip forward), which is generally a symptom of an MPEG decoder that can't keep up with the bitrate of the DVD. But the DVD was authored at 7.5Mbps max (average 5.5Mbps), and the DVD Forum standards specify that a DVD player must handle 9.8Mbps. This might not matter for most commercial DVDs, which (I've heard) tend to stay below about 5Mbps in order to coddle older players; but there are plenty of titles coming out these days that go for high bitrates to provide maximum quality. If this player can't handle them, then, technically, it is not a DVD player; it should not be advertised as such, and is probably not entitled to use the DVD Forum's DVD Video logo.Of course, it's possible that the encoder I used to author my DVD was flawed; but it seems unlikely--all three of these discs played correctly in my AMW S99."
2,The Grammar of Ornament,"I expected more, but I guess it was a great work in its time.Considering it is a reprint of a very old book, the text could have done with enlarging just prior to being printed.I cannot read it without high-powered glasses-seriously! The page size & text size is tiny!I'll have a better opinion once I've magnified the interesting sections, but I don't have the time or inclination ro do that at the moment. I bought it as a bedside book to read in the evenings, to also study a bit, but the text is frankly too tiny to enjoy, even a leisurely glance.The two stars are in anticipation of me enjoying the rest of the content when I get to see it.The minus three is because of the text size. Maybe two-an-a-half each way might have been fairer-but the print is still too small for my middle-aged eyes which normally don't need glasses."
4,A Gem,"The Grammar of Ornament by Owen Jones is a highly regarded design classic, first published in 1856 and just as relevant today. The DK edition is a pleasure to examine (although you may need reading glasses to see the six-point type for some captions). The small format fits well in the hand and has a nice heft (504 pages at 1.3 inches thick). The paper is superb and the colored inks for the thousands of engravings brilliant and crisp. If you need a version that lays flat on your drawing table or a scanner bed, however, this one has some drawbacks. The images are very tight to the inner margins, and the glued binding difficult to keep open without breaking the back. That aside, the DK edition is beautiful and a great buy."
5,This CD is the best.,"I have the thin booklet as a reference to the CD, which I purchased some years ago. If you do Webpage design this CD is a must have. Unlike other CDs of Grammar of Ornament this one has the images in EPSF, JPEG and PDF form. Others I've looked at only had PDF and that doesn't do me any good. I've used Fireworks from Macromedia's Studio MX Suite to make backgrounds and buttons for webpages made with Flash and Dreamweaver. If you can get your hands on this CD or any of the other CDs Direct Imagination has created, do it. I do think Grammar of Ornament is the best of all the ones Direct Imagination produced. Having the book for reference with it is handy, but if you can only get the CD alone, do it anyway. After a while you just know which plate has which graphic."
1,Avoid like the plague,"Before purchasing I would have wanted to know that:This was an OCR scan copy and that the OCR is full of garbage pages.This doesn't contain any of the COLOUR prints for which this book is so well known.This doesn't contain ANY prints at all - and is consequently utterly devoid of purpose.A truly comprehensive gutting of an important design work, a visual reference without any visuals, a waste of paper. Congratulations Amazon."
1,A BIG DISAPPOINTING,"I WILL REPEAT A REVIEW, LIKE IT WAS MINE:Before purchasing I would have wanted to know that:This was an OCR scan copy and that the OCR is full of garbage pages.This doesn't contain any of the COLOUR prints for which this book is so well known.This doesn't contain ANY prints at all - and is consequently utterly devoid of purpose.THANKS AMAZON!"
2,Landscape fabric,"The fabric was much thinner than I expected for a ""20 year"" fabric. I'll let you know in 20 years whether it lasted or not, but I have my doubts. I plan to purchase something locally in the spring to finish up the project rather than ordering another roll."
5,Outstanding Weed Control,I have used this product for about the past 15 years. There's no other weed control fabric like it (it is patented). Other products are too porous and allow the roots to penetrate. The Dalen fabric has a smooth top surface that the weeds cannot penetrate. It is tough and lasts. It keeps the soil moist so your plants will stay green and lush. I recommend getting the large staples to keep it in place since it has a tendency to roll up when you're laying it down.
5,Really helpful,"With words divided according to topics (sports, TV etc), it helps you keep in mind words. It is also helpful for Writing. I strongly recommend it."
2,Not very helpful,Allows you to write but the words seem to be very advanced for an ESL student unless they are advanced in their learning
3,Need more complex words,Fine for lower level students but needed a book that includes words that are more complex. My students need a challenge to move on.
4,400 Must- Have Words for the TOEFL,"It is amazing book , when i read it I get a good score ibT TOFELI recommend buying this book it is really useful book"
4,"Contains frequent-used academic words, but lacks example sentences","This is a very nice book for studying for the TOEFL. I agree that the 400 words that are listed in this book are must-have words for preparing for the TOEFL. But there are two things this book lacks. First, there are only one or two example sentences per each words. Secondly, there is not much practice problems. These two shortages make what's in the book so simple. To describe this book in two words: Too Simple."
4,nice backpack for a good price,"I have a 15.4 inch macbook pro, there's a bit of extra space around it in the pouch. The bag holds a good amount, maybe 2 1 inch binders, some notebooks, your cables and a mouse. Although you might not want all that weight on the computer. There are two pouches on the side that can fit a big nalgene each. It's comfortable and a good size. I thought I wanted something smaller, but its just the right size for what I need. It's well constructed... there's a pouch on the bottom that I'm not sure what its for. Anybody know?"
5,Solid backpack,"Very happy with this backpack - enough padding and space for my laptop and feels solidly built. Not a ton of room, but plenty for a few books and stuff."
3,had some new stuff,This dvd came as advertised. It had some new data in it but of course it was not really up to date and could be updated with the latest data.
1,Private Passions,Was not impressed with this video I am big fan of Sybil Danning and the parts she played was very minimalThe story lacked depth with a young lad trying to find his viginity and story shows Sybil showing him the way .........Not impressed
4,A very entertaining read,"My 2 year old daughter loves this book. We have a lady bug handpuppet and I act out all of the ladybugs actions with the puppet as I read the book. My daughter's favorite part is when the elephant sneezes aaaaaachooo! It makes her laugh every time. Unfortunatly this part of the book is a fold out page and I try to avoid buying books with them if it all possible. Of course the page got ripped by an over entheusiastic toddler who just couldn't wait to get to her favorite part. I taped it back together and while it bothers me that it is ripped it does not faze her in the least. The story is delightful, the illustrations are sweet, and it makes my daughter laugh all of which makes this a winner."
1,the very lazy ladybug,I was less than impressed. The item was marked as new/gently used and it came with bent marks and the center page fell out.
5,"Very cute, entertaining story.","Very cute, entertaining story. Nice pictures. Worth a lot more than the price paid!!"
4,"Race, Gender, and Discrimination at Work ( Foundation of Social Inquiry)",It is intresting and a good read.
4,"fair condition, for being so old","The movie is from 1986 so that being said, it is it fair condition. Looks like it once belonged to a movie rental store, so it has a nice sturdy case, movies a little fuzzy at the beginning, but it clears up after a few minutes. It's in fairly good condition given the age of the movie."
3,VCR tape of The Great Land Of Small,"This was the children's movie I was looking for, but the condition was not as described for a used tape supposed to be in excellent condition. The tape was damaged and could not see complete movie."
2,Goofiest Kids Film of All Time!,"Basically, it's about a two Canadian kids and their mom whohave to go see their grandparents (the grandad is creepy) in thecountry and encounter a midget who takes them to a goofy land where people dress up in cheap costumes, juggle balls, and smile alot. This so called Great Land is ruled by the midget's 'brother' and some huge terd-like thing called Slime-o. The acting and diolog is bottom barrel. Then there's some weird outcast named Mimick who lives in a shack and helps the kids. A must see for those (like me) who love camp!"
1,this is what street drugs do to french canadian producers.......,"this is what happens when you do heroin. you marry club footed midgets, dress up like butterflies, and juggle a lot. after watching this movie my friends and i found ourselves face down in a pool of puke trying to drown ourselves. I think the real problem was that we were not on acid or any other hallucinagen. If this were a book, we wish that book burnings were still legal.I would describe the plot to you but that's impossible being as it doesn't really have one. But i will tell you that the MOST disturbing part of this movie is that apparently other people actually LIKE IT!So if you like freakish movies with chanting midgets who worship giant balls of glitter puking rocks and horrible 80's music......i still strongly suggest you rent this move take it home and burn it before it even gets near your VCR."
5,really good reading,Another great one by Ralph Compton. I love a good western and this is the best I have found since L L'Amour (sp)
4,A good book,"I liked this Ralph Compton book except that the dialogue once in a while seems rather hokey and Compton displays no knowledge of clothing and gun and gun leather detail from the Old West. I can live with those details, but I'll tell you one thing: if you want to talk Louis L'Amour and Ralph Compton, you have come nowhere near the surface. The best western writer out there is Kirby Jonas, whom critics call the New Louis L'Amour. If you want some reading without equal, try Kirby Jonas."
3,Interesting look at a dated philosophy,"The book is a collection of brief essays explaining and advocating Syndicalism. Most of the arguments are very weak, however the book does end up being an effective manifesto or statement of belief, even if the arguments in favor of the belief are unconvincing. As a manifesto, it's worthwhile reading for those who wish to learn more about what Syndicalism was."
4,An Intelligent work!,"Palm Sunday is no longer just a holiday. W. Vitanyi has introduced us to a whole new world. A world most of us don't even know exists. Under the streets and through the fiber optics, W. Vitanyi takes us on a journey through the cyber world that escalates as it goes. With intricate detail and incredible intelligence, we are woven into the lives of Stanley, Katherine, Bobby, Slocum and more to find out how ordinary people, using their knowledge, intellect, and innovation, deal with unordinary circumstances and danger. The book is a twist of action and knowledge which would make it an incredible and usable teaching tool for a generation weaned on technology. But it's not over till it's over - the ending leaves one with a sense that Wm. Vitanyi is not done yet. I have a feeling we'll be seeing more of ""Palm's"" characters. Technology is always moving forward so no doubt Wm. Vitanyi will find another technical avenue to take his characters down and hopefully, in the very near future."
5,Finally my trilogy is complete!,Book was mailed right away. Good packaging and first rate dealer. Would reccomend this dealer to everyone. Thanks so much.
2,The Series is getting better !,"I was not going to buy the sequel but did anyway, she is making better choices in her characters development and more thought seems to be in this book then the first one. I love the cover !"
4,Love everything she writes!,"I discovered Amanda Cockrell several years ago with the first Deer Hunters trilogy and I couldn't wait to read more of her books--waited impatiently for the next book to come out. She does not disappoint in this trilogy. Her characters are fleshed out and her plots keep me turning the pages. I only hope my success is near hers with my first book, ""Forever Retro Blues,"" and I hope there are many more of her books to read in the future."
5,ZAPPA -- HIS GIG AS MASTER COMPOSER,A fantastic album with top notch production and perfect performances of a really original spin of old big band stuff. This is not rock. Some mighty good horn arrangements and very unique timbres. Enjoy.
5,A MUST LISTEN album!,"Zappa, hard to take seriously after notorius gross-out tunes like 'penis dimensions', revealed his serious musical psyche with the stunning title track 'Waka-Jawaka', an amazing piece comprised of a main theme coupled with secondary poly-melodic & counterpuntal themes, and utilizing atypical scales. The main melody grabs you and burrows into your brain, then eloquently flows into artfully crafted solos from Zappa's top-notch sidemen, who served with the likes of Buddy Rich, Benny Golson, and Bill Watrous. Don Preston's mini-moog solo is required listening for any keyboard player, along with drummer Dunbar's clinic on polyrhythm. This is an instrumental masterpiece, culminating with Zappa restating the opening horn phrase in cut-time while the band blows on in 4/4. Amazing in every respect, Waka-Jawaka whets your appetite--after 33 years, it's still as fresh to me as the first time I heard it!"
5,One of Zappa's best.,You liked Hot Rats ? The grand wazoo ? What are you waiting for ?A phenomenal CD.
5,One of his best...,"Great music and band. Every track is awesome...all four songs are definitely worth it! Sal Marquez's trumpets are one of my favorite highlights of Waka/Jawaka. This is a cd for all music lovers, jazz lovers, Zappa lovers, and people who particularly dug The Grand Wazoo and Imaginary Diseases. Upon first listening to it it became one of my top 5 Zappa Albums (Jazz From Hell, Make A Jazz Noise Here, The Yellow Shark, You Are What You Is, One Size Fits All, and the You Can't Do That On Stage Anymore series are some of my favorites). I own over 40 of his cds and love them all, but this one quickly rose to the top of the list for me."
4,A complex work you can appreciate by listening carefully,"It's difficult to appreciate it at its first listen, but after being in the habit with his experimental stuff, this album can be essential in every ""prog collection"", even though the whole material is a bit out of such ""progressive genre""...I suggest you to listen to every song carefully, and then you can enter his magical world more easily!!Recommended!!"
3,Surface-Level Beauty ...,"The Butterfly Lovers re-imagines a classic Chinese folktale for a new generation, but, sad to say, it falls a bit short of enchantment. If you take a chance on purchasing it, you probably won't be disappointed with the animation, but I doubt you'll return to it often. To this animation aficionado, The Butterfly Lovers suffers from the same maladies as the majority of Dreamworks animated films - technically-accomplished animation that tries desperately to support scripts that lack both eloquence and substance. In the end, the film is just the culmination of dutiful animators, not passionate artists. It's missing its living spirit, and the magic is easily broken."
3,Very cute wolf,"The plush is as described except this is not the same color as pictured...It's not grey and white but brown and beige... And like some other reviewers said, he spreads his hair on clothes, floor... Anyway, will be used as a decoration more than a toy for my kids, this is so cute, soft and so realistic.Update: It's been one year that this review has been written, the picture has been updated in the meantime and now shows the exact color of the wolf. It still spreads a little hair but remains a favorite plush at home :)"
5,amazing,my gf loved it as a Christmas present she sleeps with it every night its warm and so cuddly and the cat i have thinks it is a really dog and runs away when she see it
3,Looks Great,This stuffed animal looks great but within 2 weeks we had to sew up a hole. It's not been abused but hopefully the seams won't continue to be an issue.
5,My niece loved it!,My little great niece loves wolves - I loved her face when she opened the package containing this stuffed wolf. She was walking around hugging and squeezing it. I highly recommend this product.
4,Nice Addition To The Family,"I was pleasantly surprised when this wonderful wolf arrived in the mail. It was crammed into a rather tiny box, so when I opened it up and it began to ""expand"" to it's full size, I was amazed. The detail is great, and it offers some rather good ""poseability"". Originally purchased as a gift for a wolf collector, I ended up getting one for myself to stand guard (relax) at the foot of my bed. Not really sure this is much of a toy, though I know I would have been dragging it around by the tail if I had one as a child. Does seem pretty durable, and the details are pretty accurate without looking menacing or too cartoon like. If you get this item, you will be pleased."
5,Very life-like...,This is a perfect size for a companion or pillow! Perfect for the serious lover of wolves. Three more words...
5,Great value genuinely LARGE plush,"I used to buy stuffed animals before the 'beany baby' craze, which seems to have been the beginning of the end of large plush animals. Back in the 90's Douglas (for example) made life sized plush, and Cascade (before they were bought out) made fantastic quality plush animals. Now Douglas' idea of 'large' is about 14"". Very sad. Which is why it's so delightful that this manufacturer are making a wolf toy which is genuinely big, genuinely cheap, and genuinely fairly good quality (FWIW the only canine plush I own which has dewclaws). I've bought better plush, but nowadays the size/cost/quality equation is a no brainer. Fifteen years ago this would have been good. Today it's great.Cuddelkins also include a multi-language tag which decries anti-wolf hype, which can only be good."
4,better than a real one,"I got mine at a store but a review is a review.overall this is a nice toy, it is a toy so it won't be an exact replica of a real wolf, its plastic eyes gaze at you as if it wants something (your cookies?) the felt claws are non threatening.though, the whiskers could come out though if you push and pull at them.its hugeness makes for lots of hugging fun, even when you are an older person, because it is so big it makes a good pillow and or cushion. its floppy nature is amusing and makes it funny to look at.the doll comes with some information about wolves on a hanging tag, these are in several languages"
4,Plush Wolf large on Actuality,"thirty inches does not cut it, you have to see it to believe it is BIG! Largest stuffed, plush wolf I've ever seen. Instant hit with my decor!"
5,Puppy!,"I was getting this for a friend of mine. But when it came in...let's just say I have to get another one cause I love it too much.The fur is super soft! It's like petting a real ""puppy"".When I held it like a cat (slung over my shoulder), my boyfriend commented on how real it looked.I'm really happy with the plushie and I recommend getting one!"
5,Great for Kids and Collectors,"I love this guy so much I'm even getting him a collar. I got him for myself as a graduation present a while ago and I have absolutely no regrets. He's huge (at least 4 inches larger than anything else in my extensive plush animal/Pokemon collection) and a bargain for this price. Unlike some of the other reviewers have said, mine didn't have any shedding issues. On the other hand, even though the box he came in was massive, one of his legs wasn't straightened out when he was packaged and it still won't lie right over a year later. I might restuff it later, but even with this minor problem he's about as close to perfect as you can get for less than $50. He makes a great pillow and all three fabrics he is made of are very soft and durable. I think his claws are made of felt, so there are no sharp edges anywhere. I would recommend this as a gift for children, but not really young children; it would definitely be a nightmarish mess if they decided to cut or pull out the fur."
5,Great companion,"The face doesn't look real, thank goodness, but the fur sure does. I bought this for my daughter's second birthday (she thinks it's a dog) but it was a bigger hit with the adults. Like I do with our dog, I found myself shielding my food if I sat near it. There are tiny bean bags in each paw to give them weight which adds a nice touch of authenticity when you pick it up or turn it over."
5,Great Plushie,Bought for Christmas. It was in a bag so I took it out and fluffed it. It now looks like something my Niece will love for Christmas. Excellent stuff toy and big too.
1,WARNING: This product contains carcinogens.,"After paying for this item, I received this message from Amazon.comWARNING: This product contains chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm.I had a tumor on my Parotid gland and had it removed. I didn't think it was worth the risk of taking a known carcinogen. This warning is only sent to residents in California. It would be better if it was on the listing so buyers from everywhere can make an informed decision. DNA Laboratories didn't offer any reassurance when I contacted them with my concerns, and wouldn't cancel the order, so it ended up in the bin when it arrived."
2,Very disappointing,"There a a few good chapters in this book, particularly the one on ""Best Practices"", but overall this is pretty shabby stuff.Yourdon's problem is that in his ""Decline & Fall of the American Programmer"", he got it all wrong, so he lacks credibility, but for most of the book he hasn't got any hard evidence to offer to support his new thesis. A lot of what he presents as revelation (e.g. ""good-enough software"" or cultural problems limiting the effectiveness of Indian software houses) will strike many IT professionals as glaringly obvious."
2,He shouldn't have changed his mind.,"Although I haven't yet finished this book I can't help but feel that he was closer to the mark with his first book. In the last three years many foreign countries have been ramping up the amount of software development they do for American (and European) clients. Local software developers cannot compete on cost, so they must compete either on innovation or quality. They're not making it on quality and innovations can only take you so far."
2,Outdated and almost completely wrong,"I had to buy this for my CASE tool class. First of all, Yourdon's reliance on ""models"" to illustate his concepts is ridiculous. The Maturity model, the SEI model...its all useless.If people in the IT industry tried to follow these models, they would end up ""dead and destroyed.""This book is boring, as well. It is his attempt at redeeming himself after his first book.I could go on and on..."
3,A good one for Greenhouse owners!,"Good greenhouse info, but not worth 100. Hardley nothing on selling and hydroponics. Where are the new products? Mostly growing and what not to do, but you can fine some money saving ideas here. I like the book ""Secrets to a Successful Greenhouse and Business"" for starting a business, it has all the information you need."
4,A comment on free speech,"For me, and I speak for no one but me, this is an album about the first amendment. I tend to refuse to read other reviews about anything I review, though I do occasionally do it. For this, I have honestly not looked at another review. I only know that there are a ton and a half of 5 star reviews. All in all, this is a great album. It shows what happens when we let others decide what is right for us to listen to. There are many classic songs here. Come on, how can you not love ""catholic girls"", ""crew slut"", ""dong work for yuda"", ""why does it hurt when i pee"" or the ""central scrutinizer"" itself?I think if one really listens to this album, one cannot help but love it. It is a smidge campy, but all great music. This is Jazz Fusion and Zappa at a 10+. Enjoy it."
4,Frank Zappa / Joes Garage Remaster,"The best release of this cd so far, it finally has some tone. It could be better but it's better than the original cd release by far."
5,Joe's Garage... A True Classic,"Joe's Garage is an absolute classic, from one of the finest musical minds the world has ever known. Yes, this album is a little crude, but it served its purpose in the late 70's and early 80's. It's just to bad Mr. Zappa is no longer with us as he'd still be contributing in a major way to the music scene."
3,Shlockingly good to shockingly good,"3 1/2Zappa is one of those rare artists that can be forgiven for even the most impulsive (and repulsive) indulgences because of all the other tools this mechanic readily works with. This double can often feel like a trek for talent, and the running narrative does little to encourage repeated listens, but when the music takes unexpectedly (and often) tremendous turns into progressively composed, virtuoso territory you always remember why this purveyor of perverse is celebrated with a complete straight face."
4,garage review,"Great music, Vinnie C is on the drums, He is a great player,this is one of His first epic recordings"
5,Awesome musicianship!!!,A fascinating cd on many levels. Vinnie Colaiuta's playing is on another level altogether!
2,"Aw, come on...this is crap","Look, Im a Zappa fan who has listened to most of the man's entire output. I'm in agreement, that Zappa was a unique figure in American music.BUTThis is his weakest effort, shamelessly pandering to the same people he seems to parody. It's truly air-head rock, not much different than AOL rock, with little Zappa humor and flourishes. The humor is either dated, or aimed at pre-teens. This period of Zappa (early 80's)I enjoy the least.Zappa was brave. Zappa was brilliant. But Zappa was not occasionaly without fault.Im sure there are more meaningful performances in the Vault, than this mash-up of psuedo-reggae, glam-rock and purile humor."
3,not essential,"It may be something of a dissenting opinion, but to me this concept album hasn't aged well. Some of the compositions (based on live vamps) are nice, like the last few minutes of Packard Goose, Catholic girls, Stick it out and Outside now.Water melon in Easter Hay is the most beautiful melody ever to be played on this side of Schubert (and accounts for star # 3 on its own)and Ike Willis' voice is in fine form throughout, but on the whole I find this album a bit silly. The Scrutinizer bits are all over the place, neccessary to get the story across perhaps but downright silly.The point he wants to make is better expressed on other albums (notably Broadway) and songs. The sterile sound doesn't help either. It is amazing for instance how most of the songs improve in their live versions. The title track for instance is a must hear on YCDTOSA III.Easy listening with a lyrical twist. Daring for your parents perhaps but not audacious enough musically compared to most of his other stuff"
2,A road map please?,"When the album works, it's fun. You can always enjoy the title track, or Catholic Girls. And Outside Now helps reaffirm what made Zappa a guitar legend. Aside from that, especially with the constant expositions from the Central Scrutinizer who keeps sticking his nose in (sorry, Frank) through the album, I found the album gets dull pretty fast. It's a concept album that goes all over the place."
1,Bleah,"So far, Zappa's most boring album in my collection to date. Starts out strong, then turns into a sophomoric snicker fest that no one but the artist would relate to. Uninvolved, musically speaking. Only worth borrowing from a friend for the title track and ""Catholic Girls"", both of which can probably be found live in a better form, and hopefully around better material. After that, theres groupies, machine sex, and a world without music. Im sure The Master was trying to make a statement here, but in the end, youre not moved to care. You can almost tell Zappa knows its a tossoff. A three album tossoff, to boot."
1,This toilet humor offends me!,"Songs like ""Why Does It Hurt When I Pee?"" offend me to no end! I am disgusted! One song in particular, ""Stick It Out"", just made me shake my head. This guy is a talentless hack! Go listen to a real album, like St. Anger!"
4,Song identity?,"Who sings the song ""Revolving?"" Is it Jane's Addiction? They just have Alpha Dog listed, and I dont think Alpha Dog is a bands name"
5,Great Music For All Ages,I love this CD! Johnette has created music that you do not get tried of when your kids want to hear it over and over again. (As mine do) My 8 year old loves it and so does my 3 year old. It is the best children's cd out there. The songs are toe-tappers.
5,Super sweet book!,Love the book and the song! Beautiful to have them combined this way! The story follows the images the song creates for you beautifully!
4,Miracle on the 17th green,"This was a good movie but, you knew what was going to happen. It was a good true story."
5,Smaller than you may think,"I love this thing. Easy to set up, and as far as I can tell it's fairly accurate. This device is much smaller than I imagined it to be, so pay close attention to the dimensions. Plenty of options to choose from and easy to install. I would definitely recommend."
4,"Does Everything I Need, Nothing I Don","The screen is large enough to display both your current speed and milage or time of day, which is nice. Plus is slides out easily. Be sure it's you and not some guy walking by your parked bike!My only quibble is that its a little hard to set initially, and if you make a mistake (km vs miles) you have to start from scratch."
1,Incomprehensible instructions,I just spent a half an hour trying to figure out how to set the wheel size. The instructions included with the product are no help whatsoever... how do you do it? I have no idea. Useless.
4,Cateye CC-VL510 Bicycle Computer,"Unit seems to work well, but picture based directions could be much better. More written detail would certainly help.This product seems sturdy and well built, but carefully plan your installation and be careful about the poor quality of the instruction drawings. I did have a problem in that I didn't set the device to the proper wheel size. Once that was done all worked well."
2,Worked Fine for 8 Mo.; Installation Instructions Terrible.,"The functions seemed very nice. Too bad the instructions are just the opposite. The instructions are printed on onionskin paper - thin, like toilet paper, and in teeny 2-point typeface. Very hard to read! Also, the text is minimal, as the manufacturer chose to use illustrations instead, somewhat like an inexpensive plastic model airplane. If you want one, take your time studying the instructions and don't expect installation to be intuitive or quick. Now the bad news. I was pleased at the way it worked for a year, until it failed. No, a new battery didn't help. I will replace it with a Sigma."
3,directions?,instructions could be a lot better. especially for those who have never purchasd one before. after several hours of messing w it seems to work fine
1,Fell Apart,"The clock was difficult for me to get out of military time. In fact, I never figured it out. The little button that you push to set the clock broke when I pushed it in. I had a second odomoter that I attempted to set the time with and still could not figure it out. Also, the odometer attaches to the bike with sticky adhesive. The adhesive came off in the first five minutes. I ended up returning this item, both I had ordered. It was not worth the hassle!"
2,Too basic,"yeah it works. Yes it's easy to install.But it doesn't tell you much. No ride time, no average speed.If you do any type of tracking for training or fitness, spend more and get more."
1,piece of crap,bought one of these at a local bicycle shop . it stoped worked after the third ride on bicycle . this product is nothing but crap! do not waist you money on this trash it will stop working after only a few rides .
4,Great computer,If you need the standard info on your ride this is the deal. read ver carefully the instruction manual for the installation. my only problem with this computer is that doesn't have read light for nocturne rides.
5,Cateye Computer,"Works great, easy install. Kinda wish it had an avg speed, but I knew that when I bought it. Looks great on the bike, easy to use also."
2,Guess what?,"Big suprise, dogs know that we aren't dogs. The gig is up, dogs don't relate to us the way they relate to dogs. Get a book that really teaches you how dogs think and learn."
2,Not Dog Whisperer or even close,"This just reads like it's outdated. Maybe it hasn't been updated in years, I don't know. For a better method look to Dog Whisperer titles. (No, I have NO connection with the D.W. titles! But I do know what works.)"
1,Way too overrated!,"This book was a big disappointment. There's nothing new in the book. The concept of ""Mother knows best"" is just plain wrong. Teaching a dog has nothing to do with being a surrogate mother. The author keeps repeating herself without providing useful information. The whole book could be shortened to an insteresting article in a dog magazine. In its present form it is way too long. The author also contradicts herself many times. She emphasizes that learning should be fun for the dog and the owner, then on page 107 when she teaches SIT STAY she writes ""He [The dog]understands that when you call him he must go to you and that if he doesn't, you will bore hime to death..."" All in all, I would not recommend this book to any serious dog owner."
5,Our Great Dog is the Best Compliment for this Book,"After reading this thoroughly enjoyable book and following it word for word in training our lab, we have also lent it to other puppy owners who have been similarily successful. Our family and friends are always amazed by how well-trained and well-behaved our Miller is and we have Ms. Benhamin's book to thank for giving us the right direction and motivation for working with our dog. I'm about to buy a couple more copies for Christmas gifts!"
5,A must for any dog-owner's end table!,"I first read this book years ago, when raising my own pup. I've read lots of books on dog behavior and training, Carol Benjamin's is BY FAR the very best! I'm purchasing one today as a gift to a friend who has a new puppy."
5,Incredible Book,As a trainer of Assistance Dogs for persons with disabilities this book has been the foundation of my training methods and I have been using it since I started with my own pet dogs at the age of 15. It is very well written and the basic concept... WONDERFUL!
5,train don't complain,I have been a dog trainer for many years. This is one of two books that I suggest to my clients. So much common sense with a dash of humor. Easy to read and implement to your training program. Great book.
4,Good book for new puppy owners,"This book is very well written and easy to read. Full of sound advice to help train your dog. Although I do not agree with the slip collar and jerk method, as I prefer a prong collar, I found the rest of the book extremely helpful."
3,sweet story of raising puppy,"This is a very heart-warming kind book on how to raise a puppy the way a dog mother would do it. The problem is if you don't have a lot of time to read a full text book, then your puppy will start mis-behaving and teaching them wrong things before you've reached the particular chapters. I would advise to buy this book and read it cover to cover before you find your new puppy so you are fully equpped!"
5,Excellent Book.,A must for anyone getting a puppy. It was informative with a touch of humor and IT WORKS.Mother knows best and so will you.
5,excellent and easy,"I am a first time dog owner and had no idea how to narrow the vastness of dog/puppy training books down to one decent book. My breeder recommended this book to me. This book is fun to read, very easy to follow, very thorough, and takes you through the process in the correct order (so you don't have to read the entire book to begin your training!) An added bonus: the author has a great sense of humor."
4,Allan Kaprow,I thought some of the essays in this book were inspiring. Especially the topics dealing with 'work vs. fun'. It made me start consciously thinking about the balance and if it can be achieved. The essay in the beginning about Jackson Pollack is kind of random so I recommend skipping it if you really want to enjoy the book and then maybe go back to it later if you want. Anyways Allan Kaprow is really cool and it's the act of spontaneity and unforeseen outcomes that make him amazing! He is one of those people that builds roads and has helped refine the philosophy behind the process of making art.
1,bad instructions,"The instructions lacked detail and order of progression. There were pieces that were left over, these pieces clearly went to another structure. The front of the building was cut for two doors and there was only one."
2,Nice Kit But Missing Pieces!,"I didn't get this farm house from amazon, but I just bought this kit, brand new from a hobby store, still in the shrink wrap, and it was not only missing three MAJOR pieces, the front of the house seems to be from a different set all together! I had to remake the entire house and use twice the glue just to make it work with out the three pieces, so if your buying a kit, beware.Other then missing the pieces, it is a nice house, but I think I'll just by the pre-built buildings from now on."
1,Wish I could give this zero stars - worse than bad,"There are books that are badly plotted, but are saved by interesting characters. There are books that have boring characters, but are well written. This piece of dreck masquarading as a novel has neither. The characters, male and female, are mean, stupid, inconsistent and just plain boring.Then there is the lack of basic research - the author has an Italian character saying ""mia cara."" Oh, come on now - even if she never say a single episode of the Aadams Family, the author should have checked that her Italian grammar was correct (but that may be the fault of the editor, too).A total waste of my time and my money. Please don't make the same mistake."
2,UGH...bad read,"This is probably one of the worst books I have read. I am very disappointed and upset that I wasted my money on it. It was so bad that I, someone who rarely writes reviews, did so just in the hope that I save someone else from reading it and have them save their money. UGH!!!"
1,One of the worst romance novels I have ever read!!! (And I have read a lot of them),"Save your money, don't buy this piece of garbage. What a miserable book. Full of stupid flat characters and a lame plot line. I've never been so dissapointed in leading characters, Marcus and Kate were bland boring people that never made me care about them. They were just there, and I was left wondering why i spent money on this piece of drivel.I also was not fond of the sex scenes. Don't get me wrong, a well written sex scene can add a lot to a book, but these actually made me go ""ewww"" They were crude, and rather vulgar. At one point in time she used the word ""Sawed"" in reference to the act. It was just a bad book, poorly written, and should quickly be forgotten about. Shame on you Ms. Holt for wasting my time and my money!"
1,Zero Stars if I Could,I have read many Cheryl Holt books and this one is terrible! Save yourself some time and try another one of her books.I was thankful I only gave a dollar for it at a used book store and that was too much.
2,storyteller,"I am a first time reader of Cheryl Holt. I never liked the time period where women are treated as possessions and really stupid. Where the man is the smartest and all powerful. This is one of those books. However, it also shows how much progress women have made, all on their own, fighting every step of the way and never giving up. In London, England, 1813, Kate Duncan has been stripped of her title and money but doesn't know it. She falls for Lucas, a man of wealth and power. A love potion adds a bit of intrigue to the story. Kate and Lucas sleep together again and again. This is a R rated book for me. I found the sex scenes primal and the sexual language very blunt and crude. Maybe that's exactly what the author meant it to be. Maybe the words fit the time period. I do like books with a happy ending and this has that. I will give this author another try. I enjoyed the flow of her writing and her ability to bring life to her words."
3,"Hot book, but the hero & the heroine needs some work!","This is my first Cheryl Holt book. It's sensualtiy has definitely lived up to it's name, but the story definitely needs some work. As I plan to read more of her work, I'm hoping not all her heroes are as much of a jerk as is Marcus??? Even though he did some things (which basically felt like plunging a knife into the heroines heart) in ""the name of love"", these were times where I just wanted to jump into the book and belt him one. For a strong & highly intelligent character, can a hero be more dense????? The heroine as many has said really could have gotten some backbone sooner and saved us alot of grief much sooner. I can't really decide who was denser of the two, the heroine or the hero???Well, here's to hoping for much improved characters in her next book!"
5,"Wonderful harmonies, mello & soothing","This is a great blend of Nakai's Native American melodies on flute and Eaton on guitar and several string instruments he designed and built. The result is a melodius interplay of harmonies and rhythms in a variety of instrumental sounds and some chants. Very calming, soothing -- great for relaxation or meditation."
5,"Great writing, great research","The book may not be big, but it is packed with information. You can tell the author really did his homework. The sidebars of trivia are great, and the author's story about his experience in Vegas films (""Casino"" and ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"") add yet another personal touch.I'm waiting for the casino operators to get the hint and build a casino with the theme of Old Vegas. Weatherford's book would make a great blueprint."
3,An ok book,"This book is not as interesting as one would hope. While it does provide an interesting look at Las Vegas, most of it is Entertainment related. Specifically: movies filled there, musicians who have played there, showgirls and celebrities who live and work there."
3,shoeless rick,"My husband has a wide width foot and normally wear a 4e....we purchased these shoes and they are way to tight and i have to send them back. The quality of the shoe is nice and I'm sure, if they were wider he would have liked them very much....so sad, no i have to go shopping again :o("
1,Don't waste your time with this book.,"Offensive realists should not claim Mearsheimer as their champion. Although well written, Mearsheimer's examples do more to disprove his theory than prove it. Serious students of international relations will find this book empty and lacking logic."
3,Wrong conclusion,His conclusion of a world where states must harm each other does not follow from his assumptions; there are other ways to survive and be secure if states are rational and inherently good. I can just hope that politicians do not follow his policy prescriptions described in the book...
3,Anna Russel Encore,"Miss Russel quite funny as usual, but buyers should be warned that these CDs are cheap reissues lacking the original booklet with all the texts and lyrics.But they are not advertised as such !!!!!!"
3,RECKLESS should be titled ENDLESS...ho hum...!,"I agree with every rave review but must add that this great story could have been better told in only two episodes rather than three plus a sequel. Dear Gussie...the sturm and drang goes on and on and on and on and on.... until one wishes it were over. Anna and Owen should have tied the knot at the end of Episode Two rather than at the end of the sequel. Still, like all British shows, it is light years ahead of any American TV drama..."
5,Is the new DVD Release the complete version?,"Can anyone please tell us whether the new DVD release of Reckless is the Complete and Unedited version or does it also have "" The middle part almost completely missing!"" as described below in regards to the VHS release???PLEASE HELP!"
3,Reckless. Good DVD with one Flaw,"This was a good DVD. The case was slighty worn, as pointed out by the seller. There was one minor flaw on the DVD that was not indicated by the seller."
2,Underwhelming love story fails to thrill,"It's well-acted, well-directed and the script has witty moments, but it takes more than that to make a really thrilling love story. This slow-moving drama never really gets off the ground and there's little sense of real romantic or sexual obsession. Robson Jerome might be this season's hearthrob in TV-land but he's hopelessly outclassed by veteran actress Francesca Annis and chemistry is minimal."
4,reckless,"I saw this on my local PPS station, and really enjoyed it. When I found out I could buy it, and that there was a sequel. well I ordered right away. But when I received it was disapointed, that the frist movie is missing an entire episode at the end of the second tape. The third tape starts after they are in devorce. But they never show the affair, when he gets the sports car, and the husband is trying to find out who the other man is. Dont understand why nobody has brought this up. Alot is missing. very disapointed. Sent my copies back"
2,Warning! The middle part is almost completely missing!,"Dearest Robson Green fans . . . I bought this video set, and when it arrived, I made my popcorn and settled down for a long night of living vicariously through Anna Crane (Francesca Annis) and her steamy love affair with gorgeous Owen Springer (Robson Green). I got to see the first part, which I had missed while it was showing on PBS. Wonderful. Saw the previews for the second part, where the relationship really takes off, and poof! Nothing! We go straight to the last lap, where Anna decides which man she will go with, if either! I was devastated! Hoping it was merely a fluke with the video, I sent it back, and ordered another one. Hoping and wishing it was a fluke! Finally it arrived and poof! Still no middle scene! I don't know how the distributors got away with this, but wait for it to be redistributed, if it ever is. It's too disappointing not to have the whole thing! I give it 2 stars, just because Robson is so appealing."
4,"Fun, well-acted and written MASTERPIECE soap. Great Escape!","This is soooo entertaining. I too found myself not wanting it to end. True love is a blessing! A sense of humor helps. ""Show 'em your sex aids, Colin.""Also, I found myself turning my Closed Captioning on and off alot--to clarify some of Owen's dad's dialogue (not a drawback). Quite a variety of accents here, not to mention the slang. Other aspects: difficulty finding meaningful relationships, taking care of an incapacitated parent with grace and dignity, living with a retired alcoholic parent--who doesn't want you to butt into his life, maintaining a career as a ""single"" woman while trying to have a decent marriage, divorce and class structure as central themes. Don't want to get too deep--just watch it a time or two. It's irresistable and quite sophisticated like eating chocolate chips and pecans together--really (wouldn't joke about chocolate!). Is Owen's father related to Ray Davies?"
1,"More of the same, unfortunately","Coming from a re-reading of the superb Patrick O'Brian novels is probably the worst way to take up with Richard Sharpe again. It's like going from filet mignon to yesterday's stale Big Mac. Somehow I hope the writing will improve, but it never does. Nor is the story very edifying. Sharpe, the ""hero"" of the piece, attempts to shoot his fellow officer in the back, during battle, for no good reason other than Sharpe's chronic bad humor. Meanwhile, evil foreigners lust after a prim and beautiful English woman, while the Catholic Church comes in for the usual bashing from Cornwell, who never misses a chance to portray priests and monks in a bad light."
5,The Audio Book Of Sharpe's Escape Is Really Well Done,"Bernard Cornwell's historical fiction series of the adventures of Richard Sharpe is excellent.This audio book of one novel of that series, Sharpe's Escape, is really well done. Cornwell's writing style is well suited to the spoken word and the narrator, British actor Paul McGann, does an excellent job with the material.Great audio book. Highly recommended. I have a forty minute highway commute to and from work and I generally pass the time listening to audio books. I really enjoyed this one."
4,Another good Sharpe,"Another classic Sharpe. Like other Sharpe books, this one is a very easy-reading and entertaining book."
1,"THE ""NO"" HEADACHE VISOR","THE ""NO""HEADACHE VISOR! GAVE ME A HEADACHE!!! THE DAY I RECIEVED IT,I TRIED IT ON. IT LOOKED REALLY CUTE, BUT WITH IN A FEW MINUTES IT GAVE ME A HEADACHE! NOT TO MENTION IT LOOKED USED. BECAUSE I WORE IT OUT SIDE TO SEE IT IN THE SUN, IT SEEMED LIKE IT HAD STAINS ON IT, ALSO IT HAD LITTLE BALLS. LIKE WHEN SOMEONE HAS ALREADY WORE IT! AND ITS BLACK! IT SO MUCH GROSSED ME OUT!I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN!! I ALSO TRIED EMAILING THE COMPANY AS SOON AS I RECEIVED IT. AND AS OF TODAY, I HAVENT HEAD FROM THEM!! THEY NEED TO BE REPORTED TO BBB! THEY NEED HELP IN CUSTOMER SERVICE. I WILL NEVER BUY FROM THEM OR REFER THEM TO ANYONE!!"
1,OUCH!!,"I own at least 5 or 6 golf visors. I bought this one because I am constantly in search of a more comfortable one. This one had such great reviews I felt that this must be super comfortable - NOT!! No Headache Visor? YES, BIG headache!! By about the 4th hole it felt like my head was in a vise. I guess I always thought I had an average sized head, and no one has ever told me otherwise, but maybe not? All I know is that I've never had another visor, or any other hat for that matter, fit as tightly as this visor - this thing was just plain awful! I won't be wearing it again!"
1,no title,I bought this vior because it was written NO HEADACHE. That is not true It gives me such a headache that stayes with me for a long time it was really waste of money. behjat safavian
3,"works, sort of",it's nice but I wouldn't call it no headache. It will give you a headache if worn long enough (for me it was 90 minutes). And it tends to slide down your forehead. I wish there was more padding along the edge where it touches your head.
1,No headache???,The reason the visor does not cause headaches is because it does not stay up! It falls down my face as soon as I put it on! Didn't the maufacturer try it on first???
5,Orange Visor review,different product design: I like it! Beautiful bright color. Great fit.Fast ship. Will buy from this seller again.
2,dissapointed,The visor is so big on my head it won't stay on. I went and bought one at Walmart for 1.99 which fits much better. Wouldn't recommend this unless you have a very very large head.
4,Truthful,"The visor is as advertised and really doesn't give you a headache! However, when placing an order be careful because if you order several visors, each in different color, the final order at checkout doesn't reflect the color of each visor. I received a blue and a white visor when I thought I'd ordered one red and one white."
2,Not what I expected,"The frame arrived and it was not as I expected. The shipping charge was $22 which led me to believe it was a wood frame with glass. It was actually wood with plastic. It was lightweight and no where near 9 pounds as the description indicates (it felt like balsa wood, not a hard wood; not high quality as claimed.) It also does not come with the matting that is shown in the photograph. There is a reason the item is $99 marked down to $13, the frame mailed was not the frame in this description. I can't figure out how they justify such a high shipping charges for this item. I suggest physically going to Target and picking out a frame. Buy yourself something nice with the $22 you will save on shipping charges by doing the footwork yourself. If this is for a gift, avoid the embarassment and find a truly high quality frame."
3,Decent frame for a decent price,"Part of the shell of the frame chipped off immediately upon opening the box. Frame now has a nice white chunk in the corner. Apart from this, all's well."
1,poor quality,"I was hesitant to buy a frame online in the first place. This order confirmed those worries. This frame is made with very low quality materials and was poorly constructed. Flimsy at best. All that said, the shipping process was pretty hard on it (2 broken corners and some denting). However, I would question whether the same frame would have made it home safely in the back of my car either. Stick with your intuition here--don't buy your frame online. Especially not this one."
1,arrived broken,"I would like to have given this frame a good rating, but because of poor packaging, it arrived broken in 4 places and had pieces broken off. It was not protected and was shipped in a flattened box with very little tape. I would not recommend this to anyone given the experience I had. The quality of the frame was OK."
5,HIP PADS,This item is great. My husband is in construction but he is skinny. His tool belt would rub on his hip bones to the point that he has bruises that never go away. He now has no pain when putting on his belt and the bruising has started to go away. Perfect item for what he needed.
4,"Nice, but expensive and slightly misleading","I bought this bag a few years ago when it was higher in price. I was a little disappointed with what I got. The description of the item makes it sound like this is the ""Panasonic"" name brand bag that goes with this model camera. It does fit my camera and gear nicely.The construction is superb compared to my last camera bag, which literally fell apart piece-by-piece the more I used it (over a very short time). This bag seems to be well built and sturdy.I feel that the original $200 something price is insanely high for a bag like this, but the current price of $75 is fair. Not a steal, but fair.I'm docking this product 1 star because of the item description. The bag I got is made by a company called ""Petrol"" based in Tel Aviv, Israel. Chances are high that an OEM camera bag with the Panasonic logo would also be made overseas, I understand, but the item description says 'name brand' and not 'off-brand'."
1,"Useless, flimsy, empty","I agree with the reviewer who said this book omits much information.This book contains 7 pages on creating and modifying templates. That's nothing!I've created 8 websites over the years using Netscape Composer. A main reason I upgraded to Dreamweaver was to use templates, so I could update my navigation bars without having to update it for every webpage.This book has over 500 pages, yet devotes only 7 to creating and modifying templates. Having read all 7, repeatedly, I still can't create templates.I spent the last four hours trying to create and modify templates, but the 7 pages apparently omit some crucial information, or are poorly written."
1,VERY Disappointing,"I was very disappointed to receive the book and find the author - James Patterson - was not who I expected, but decided to take a chance anyway. The story was interesting, but I must admit, I was so unnerved by the poor job of editing that I became distracted easily. The book is published by an Online Library that apparently does not proofread before printing. The pages are filled with typographical errors and misuse of words and I found myself wanting to reach for a red pencil to circle all the mistakes rather than concentrating on the author's intent. I spent nearly $30 to receive a poor quality paperback book that will definitely find its way to the back my bookshelves - maybe into the ""bad book box"" in the corner of my laundry room."
4,Top Read from a different James Patterson,"I too was looking for more James Patterson books, when I stumbled on this title. After researching some more, I realised this James Patterson has sinced passed on, however, what an enjoyable read. Albeit, not the regular James Patterson that we all know quite well. The story has many twists and turns, and takes life back to a simpler time. The life of Five Lowry is enduring even for the 21 Century in that the story can be relayed even to todays aspects. I don't care if others are seeking the regular James Patterson and are disappointment to learn it's not. It's still a good read, and can't want to read the continuing stories, albeit, there are only two more. It would make a terrific film."
2,Typos galore,"I also bought this book thinking it was an old one by the more famous James Patterson, or perhaps a new one that had been released online. (It was distributed by ""the world's leading online library"".) Anyway, I sure was not happy when I started reading it & found a typo on the second page or thereabouts! Whoever proofed this book should be fired. It was very distracting. I also felt like the author got some of his characters mixed up throughout the book but maybe it was that I didn't care enough to keep them all straight. And I sure didn't want to go back & try to figure it out. I guess the book was OK. I did actually want to finish it but I would not recommend it to anyone else, especially with the hefty pricetag that it comes with."
5,This is one of the best rock albums ever,"Well, i was 18 when i first heard this album...and i tell you people, i was not ready...until then i Thought Yes, Santana, Led Zep, Genesis, king Crimson, gentle Giant, Soft Machine and a few other ""thinking"" bands were probably the best i would ever hear...then i discoverd Zappa and this was the intro...and what an intro it was! Not only were the songs completely funny but serious at the same time in their structure and complexity of form, but also the sheer fun of rock and roll was there too...and then there were these guitar solos , like ""Rat Tomago"" and ""Yo Mama"". Well now i am listening to Ligetti, Bartok, Muddy waters, Varese and Chuck Berry and all thanks to the music of Zappa who showed me that music is a lot more than a ""style"" or a ""genre""..."
3,No it's not,"Although I generally love his sense of humour and agree with him most of the time when he ridicules things, on this album I find mr Zappa a touch too misanthropic. The fun comes with the Dylan impersonation, and guitar playing is fine throughout, most notably on Yo mama, City of tiny lights and Tango, but to people who buy this because of the Bobby Brown hit (in Europe once every 5 years in some country) and who consider it their favorite Zappa album I say: please look and listen further. There is so much better music to discover. Although not his worst album, this one stands apart as the only one ever made by Zappa that I could not listen to from track 1 to track 18 in one go. Cynicism was destroying his career in the studio at this point, while live he was emerging with one of his best bands ever (next to the Roxy and 1988 lineups)..."
5,Soon to be reissued !,Give thanks to all who make the yellow snow - The Zappa Family Trust has finally regained control of Frank's catalog and ALL 60 FZ albums will once again be available at realistic prices before the end of the year.First 12 albums to be released July 31 - followed by 12 more/month for the next 5 months.The days of seeing insane prices on Zappa CDs is soon to be ended !!!
1,I Don't Like It,I think there are far too many details included that don't interest the average developer.
4,Patterns galore!,"My Groovy Girl-loving 4-year-old granddaughter really liked this bed, carried it into her room to play with the half-dozen or so Groovy Girls dolls scattered on the floor. It is light; I'll wait to see how sturdy it proves to be. The bedding is lots of fun: wild colors and patterns typical of GG."
1,This bed is way too short!,"I ordered this for an 18"" American Girl doll, as it was offered under furniture for 18"" dolls. The only way the doll fit in the bed was to put the head up on the headboard with a pillow. (the knees do not bend) We both loved to colors and bedding, but it was a good 6"" too short"
1,Disappointment,I received the shipment last night. I was very disheartened to realize that the bed was a hard plastic one piece bunkbed that did not have any of the cloth or covers that appear on the above image.Orignally when I placed the order I was excited that my daughter would get such a cool bed for her doll. This was nothing like I expected.I will not do this again...
2,Does not fit American Girl Dolls,I purchased this bed for my daughter as a Christmas present. She had asked for furniture for her American Girl doll. Her doll is too big for this bed. The description of this bed is not accurate. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
3,Almost Midnight: An American Story of Murder and Redemption,A real snooze and forgot about this book as soon as i made myself finish it. Do not recommend it as a good read.
3,TMI,"I selected this book because I know the area where the murders happened well. I frequent the highways and roads mentioned, and have actually driven through and around Reeds Springs, Lampe and Blue Eye MANY times. The description later in the book of Reeds Springs being like a dark shadow is very accurate. Driving through you can't help but wonder what happened there, or what might happen. However beyond my interest in the area, I felt that there was considerably more information than I needed to realize the whole story, and I often found myself bored and hoping for additional action."
5,"Classic ""Must-Have"" book","As a young girl, I adored the stories of the young boy traveling to exotic locations learning about his contemporaries around the world experiencing their cultures. It certainly made sense to me at the age of four, when traveling through Europe and seeing many of these cities highlighted in the book. Funny, I too thought I was the only one to call this book my ""favorite."" I am ecstatic that it will be reprinted as I see giving this valuable book as gifts to family and friends along with replacing my own worn, coverless, copy!"
2,"Protect Your Feet Well, But FAR Too Heavy","I work in production and we're required to wear boots with safety toes and met protectors. Wearing these boots that weigh four pounds each is exhausting when you're on your feet all day at work. These boots protect your feet well, but I was never so glad as when the year with these boots was up and the company would reimburse me for buying another pair and I bought the lightest weight HyTest brand boots I could find. Work is exhausting enough without your boots sapping you further."
3,A classic?,"I always have trouble with his synclavier work. Nice in this case are the references to band versions, and the title track (classical) is great."
5,No bulls please,"No bull..it. This classical music by Frank is superb. Zappa did it again. This just to begin. I'll add something more specific in the afternoon. But, really this is an incredible accomplishment. Music is the best."
4,a strange zappa record,this record was nominatet for a grammy in 1984 and it is a masterpice a must for all fans of zappa's classical music. it shows what a master of sound zappa was.
1,this is a defective disc,"I bought this disc from a supplier in Great Britain. It is an out of balanced disc, and wobbles in the deck. No other disc does this in my deck. Do not buy The Perfect Stranger from Amazon."
4,What detectives are really this stupid?,"i thought that this book was a great comfort read, but one thing about it really bothered me - they were trying to figure out who the miraculous medal with the initials A.M. belonged to, and the only person in the town they could think of was a young girl at the time of the murder. well, what about Adele McCormick, the schoolteacher? she has the right initials, she would've been the right age, and working in the same place as candy would've given her plenty of opportunity to somehow get in a huge fight. i just think that it's really sad that a reader noticed a possible lead that the detective (and therefore author) didn't."
3,Pretty good given its length,"I thought it was a pretty good book given its length. I had wished it was a bit longer with more in depth analysis on the different obstacles that different Arabs with different religions face. Also I would have liked to have seen a more ""inner cross-cultural"" review of the Arabs themselves and how Arabs from different countries and different cultures (say like Yemeni Arabs and Lebanese Arabs), would differ in assimilation. Obviously Arabs from countries in which assimilation would be easy because of their being occupied by European countries than less westernized countries like Yemen, Libya, Egypt, Syria, and etc."
3,Are you ready to go Dutch?,"Are you ready to go to the Netherlands where bicycal riding, canal site seeing, and tulips are done almost all year long? Do you want to know the real story? Know what's happening with Cicily's family. Join me into a world where the Netherlands are the best place to be!"
2,Season Sets Needed,"This show is awesome, well written and fun but this DVD release is pathetic. We live in the age of bluray where you can fir entire seasons on ONE disc. There's no excuse for cartoon network to keep releasing these stupid volume sets with 4-5 episodes on one disc. Give us the whole season. I would gladly pay for an entire season of this series but this volume mess is a rip off.People do one of four things with these volume sets, they buy them out of desperation, they wait until the season set comes out, they start pirating the episodes or (and this most likely on ebay and amazon) they wait until the discs are no longer in high demand and buy them very cheap on the used market which results in no sales for the DVD producer...which decreases the chances of the rest of the volumes or the season set being made.GET SMART. RELEASE THE SEASON SET."
4,Smooth! You'll love it!,"The lyrics on this CD have a wonderful tendancy of pulling you into the songs. You want to listen to them again and again until you hear each word and the music becomes one with the words. The style is distinctly different, and should be easy for anyone to enjoy no matter their current interest in music. I liked it the first time I listenend; loved it by the third time. Now, when I listen, its impossible to stop in the middle of a song. This writer / musician and the artists he puts together to make this CD make a great contribution to the selection of music today."
4,For all Hornblower addicts...,"As Hornblower Geek I thought this was very well researched and generally interesting.My only complaint was that I thought more attention should have been devoted to Maria, his first wife, though I know the author only wrote her in as a sort of afterthought. The ironical thing is that I always have found her - meant to be less interesting than Lady Barbara - far more of a rounded and sympathetic character (I so felt for her when their children die of smallpox).Generally very good."
3,Good addition to your Hornblower series,"I loved how the book adds to the myth; Was Horatio Hornblower real or fiction? I loved how after researching Horatio Hornblower for my son's Literature class, (the class read three books on him, loved them) that a Canadian historian went to the Nautical Museum in England looking for the Display on Horatio Hornblower, thinking that he was truly a real historical person..... The museum had to inform him as they have done many times to others that he was not an actual person only fiction, however they do have a display about him because he is so well known...... Book really added to the myth and led you to believe that he was real, clever, however, for someone not up on military history,this book is very deceiving........"
4,good reference,"I bought this while going to college classes and it worked out fine for assignments. My son is using it in high school now and it is good enough for that environment. Of course, with the ever changing world this is, try to always find the latest publication."
1,Very disappointed,"The product you see is not what you get. Cetaphil recently changed their lotion products and no longer sell the product you see pictured here. I was excited to see I could still buy this product online because it was the only lotion I like. However, when I received it, the product I received was the new one (which I don't like as well). Very disappointed that I paid for shipping for the new product I could have bought in the store."
5,perfect arrival in great condition,Arrived within a couple of days and was in great shape. Like I bought it from the store. Thank you
4,Hyperbaric O2 Therapy,"Book is ok, was looking more for books that explain about the approved medicare covered diagnosis and why they were approved."
3,Great interpretation... shoddy playing,I absolutely love Bernstein's interpretation of this piece it excellent. The only thing I didn't like about the recording was that some of the playing was quite a bit off.
2,"Good orchestra, incongrous interpretation","In this performance, the NYP are on cracking form. Sadly, their abilities are channeled into a dire reading of the Sixth. As the editorial review suggests, the piece does not undermine itself by dismissing the quiet interludes and sections committed to married love/solitude. Bernstein injects trite irony throughout the whole performance, destroying any sense of intimacy and the eclectic nature of the symphony. The last movement very much sums up the performance. He has no sense of the fateful abyss, as Karajan so wonderfully conjures up, and destroys the tragic structure, wherein lies much of the profundity and intellectual meat of this piece. Sadly, this is misconceived - Bernstein is almost always interesting and sometimes moving, but here he totally misses the mark with bland excess."
4,Cateye CC-ED300 Enduro vs. Bell F12,My son and I have gotten into riding to get some exercise so we wanted a way to track our speed/distance/time....etc. I purchased a Cateye and a Bell bike computer (I figured a cheap one and an more expensive one...why not....then compare how they worked).Both installed easy enough and I didn't have to tinker with much adjustment of the sensors. We have now put about 15 miles on them and both work about the same. The Cateye instructions were a bit more cryptic and it took a little longer to figure things out from a perspective of setting the time or clearing out items (time/dist). The Cateye has an 'AT' mode that you can turn on so it automatically starts once you get going (if you leave it off you have to remember to turn things on). The Bell controls were a bit easier to learn and the documentation was more clear than the Cateye. The Cateye did seem to have a better quality wheel magnet. I'll have to update in a few months when I can judge the quality better.
5,Cateye speedometer,"Bought this product a few weeks ago. Took me a bit to understand how to set all it's features, but once that was done, I really have enjoyed it."
5,Wonderful for the price!,"I've owned this for over a year and have never had a problem. Some of the other reviews sound as if they were written by morons eg: ""The instructions were written in twelve languages...geez."" That's a good thing you dope...simply read the English, if you can. I just upgraded to the wireless version simply for vanity reasons (I didn't like the look of the wire wrapped around my fork) and, again, haven't had a problem. You can buy this and be happy with it."
4,happy with it,"I did research and decided to try this. It works great. Nice big M.P.H. display. My only complaint is that the instructions were written by someone who has a strong dislike for humans. Other than this, I really like it"
3,ditto on setup,"you think the guy was kidding about not being able to get it to show in mph - that's no joke. the interface is not intuitive at all, and once you've lost the manual get ready for some fun trying to remember how to reset the mileage."
2,Rear Wheel Setup Caution,"Like many cyclists we use a rear wheel bicycle trainer extensively when the winter weather makes training outdoors dangerous. When we were researching cyclometers we looked for any information that stated ""For front wheel use only""; or, ""Does not fit for rear wheel"". We even went to the Cateye website and looked at their chart to see if there was any information or category stating ""front wheel only"" for the Enduro 8. Only after doing this research did we then order the Enduro. GUESS WHAT!! The wire length is too short for a rear wheel setup on a standard size bicycle. Thus useless for a rear wheel trainer (unless you have a minibike). Rating of 2 stars is for not providing crucial information for prospective buyers. Update March 28 2007. Cateye was prompt and helpful with my problem. I ordered their extra long kit (more money of course). The Enduro works just fine. I've upgraded the rating to 3 stars."
1,Defective +++,"It came with a dead battery, I got a fresh one, it checks at 3v with a DC voltmeter, but only parts of the digits turn on. Since I am in the Philippines now, returning it is economically impossible. BUT I can get some satisfaction by removing the battery and smashing the computer with a hammer!!!"
1,cateye time to fast,Cateye HL-EL135 LED Bicycle Headlightheadlight keeps time incorrectly. needs clamp screw which tightens more snug. thank you.
2,Boring boring boring,"I am really disappointed by this CD, as I have enjoyed some of Meshell's past work. I understand that Meshell is a ""serious person"" with ""serious"" things to say, but to be quite honest, if I had wanted a lecture I would have gone to one.There's nothing wrong with releasing a CD with political content, but it doesn't mean it has to be boring (Gil Scott Heron, The Last Poets, Public Enemy, Spearhead etc etc) but at least they have TUNES and a bit of FUNK and sometimes even a spark of humour (!)Buy a CD by Larry Graham and a book by CLR James instead -more interesting basslines, and more interesting ideas."
4,"Nice, consistent effort","I was glad to hear this cd after ""Bitter"", which I wasn't feeling too much. It took me a couple of listenings, but it think that I can now appreciate the vibes coming through the speakers when I hear this one. Being from DC, ""Berry Farms"" and ""Dead N**** Blvd"" strike a particular cord with me. Again, solid and consistent effort.P.S. If you haven't seen Meshell live, you should. I saw her a couple of years ago at TLA in Philly and the show was the [best]. Where are all the other DC artists?"
4,Not Plantation Lullabies...but its still good!,"Due to me being a huge fan of her first album, I'm felt almost compelled to give this five stars. MY most challenging issue with this album? The production side of it-- it is far less head-bobbin' than I would have liked. :-/ However, make no mistake MeShell still delivers some interesting gems on this one.--Standouts--* Hot Night- She goes right after fascism, racism, and cyclical struggle ...chile, MeShell's rolls up her sleeves on this track. Talib Kweli does his thing on this too. Hot night, hot track!* Berryfarms- She shares her first bi-sexual experience which is conveyed in third person.* Earth- MeShell in love...* Criterion- MeShell offering unconditional love..* Trust- MeShell's deliverance of swagger and vulnerability.Note: This should not be your MeShell-fan-starter album so don't make this your first purchase, if your new to her work. Pickup Plantation Lullibies or Peace Beyond Passion first."
5,"This one is hot, hot, hot!!!","Not that Me'Shell needs to prove herself, she has already done that with her three previous releases but I gotta say it, BABY GIRL GOT TALENT and this CD proves it and then some!!! Whew, I put this one soon after buying it and already I'm saying this is my jam. From ""dead ni**a blvd"" to ""hot night"" to ""pocketbook"" this is one is hot, hot, hot!!! Me'Shell is known for her lusty and romantic ballads and she doesn't deviate from that instead turning it a couple of notches with ""trust"",oh my my, please be careful with this one. My advice: buy it, play it often, and don't forget to turn up the air conditioning when you do."
5,"I DONT THINK YOU""RE READY FOR THIS JELLY...","She has done it again. Returning to the funky bass grooves and old skool sound of plantation lullabies, mixed with the sultry vocals that ran rampant throughout peace beyond passion. Our girl has done it again!!!! From the beginning, her lyrics of Dead Nigga Blvd. are empowering causing you not only to think but make you sit back and groove at the same time. For her DC fans Meshell takes it back to her go-go days, as she reminisces about a girl from the past on her track Berry Farms. The album is alive with spoken word, knowledge and the funk. The use of new producers, Redman, Missy Elliott,and her protege Tweet, may give her first single ""Pocketbook"" a more commercial appeal but don't let the smooth taste fool you our girl is still the same. DONT SLEEP! This is the best one yet..."
4,a Strong Set,i have followed MeShell'Ndegeocello's Career.She is a Very Talented Artist&adds alot of Feeling in Her Music to me.I like Her Direct take on Her work.She is a Very Underrated Artist&She deserves more respect.Her&Her Band are very much on point with there Groove.I don't think She needs any Re-Mixes added To Her Raw Vibe.I don't Label Music but the Industry has this thing Called Neo-SOUL& I gotta say without a Doubt MeShell blows them all away.
5,might be too black for some of yall.(you know who you are.,"meshell has nailed it to the wall. she's bringing it strong, hard and funky. this cd awakens the africa in you, so you negroes need not bother, because these sounds will be just too black for ya.this sistah is at the top of her game, and spiritually on fire.no doubt this is the cd of the year, and definitely at the top of my top 10 cd's of the year. the shame of it is, that it probably won't get much air play, because the plantation radio stations don't really want message music to get out on the airwaves. if she comes to a city near you, don't pass up an opportunity to see her. you will not be dissapointed. so if you want to hear some incredible funky soul music go out and purchase this cd."
2,It's really nothing like her first 2 albums.,"I loved her first two albums (who's titles escape me at the moment.) I bought ""Bitter"" (album #3) and was disappointed because it was a departure from the sound of the first two.When I saw that ""Cookie"" was out, I figured that I'd check itout and see if she'd gone back to the funk stuff.Answer: Nope.Artistically, I like how she chooses to talk about her topics, but I just am not all that interested in listening to the music.Bottom line: I didn't really like it because the music was different. If you're into her stuff because of the topics/poetry rather than the music, you might like this album."
2,Found the writing style unbearable,"I read about this in Publisher's Weekly, so I thought I'd check it out. I took it to the gym, so it was the only thing I had to read while on my stationary cycle. I still couldn't read it. The dispassionate writing style made it seem like I was looking at the characters through dirty water."
1,A disappointing waste of time,"This book came as a big disappointment especially as I was so looking forward to reading it. The plot is incredibly weak, the characters shallow and their reactions and emotions unbelievable. The pace is slow and half the time one isn't sure exactly what is going on. She uses a unique style of writing dialogue so that one isn't always sure who is speaking. The saving grace is that in some parts the style is good and there are some paragraphs which are quite well written and readable. For the rest, a boring and definitley not recommended read. Pity ..."
2,"As a South African acquaintance said to me ""I've never been","As a South African acquaintance said to me... ""I've never been able to finish a Gordimer book"". I decided I would finish this book, and it is well written if in an archingly intellectual manner. But its tough going...too detached, and ultimately not enough to keep you wanting to go back. I chose it at random since I had heard so much about Nadine Gordimer, but had never read any of her work. Suggest finding another one."
1,BORING,"This is one of the worst books I've ever forced myself to read: academic writing style, feeble plot, very forced. There is no humour or humanity in this book. A complete waste of a good tree."
3,Pretty Sweet!!!,this album is a great item for any Men at Work movie fan. I would recommend it to everyone who enjoyed the movie.
4,"Post-concert purchase, not regretted","Usually when you buy the CD after hearing the band live - any band - you're bound to be disappointed when you listen to it later. Not so with this CD! I bought this after being completely wowed by the PHJB live in Preservation Hall itself, and though it's certainly not the same feeling as being there (no audience feedback on the CD), it's absolutely wonderful music performed by wonderful musicians. A particular favorite is ""Petite Fleur,"" which is lilting and lovely, and which they played one of the nights I saw them. A fond memory, to say the least. The only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that it's a little too polished to sound completely real. I prefer their new effort, recorded in the Hall - and a 2 CD set to boot! But still - you WILL NOT be disappointed with this collection."
2,Great Stories,"The stories in the book are great,however, there aren't any user friendly suggestions for using the book in the classroom. Since I've already purchased the book, I will probably use it once or twice just to get my money's worth."
4,Chris Hillman - Slippin Away,"The music in this album is very good. It is not like what you here in Desert Rose Band or The Byrds. It shows another side of him instead of the country rock or bluegrass which he is really good at. Down In The Churchyard is an OK tune but does not compare to what he did with it while with the Flying Burrito Brothers. Steppin On Out was a little different than what I here on the Desert Rose Band. I recommend this album to the die hard Byrds, Flying Burrito Brothers, Desert Rose Band or even The Hillmen fans. It shows a lighter side of him which leads to how we know him today."
4,"Historical, Enthuasiastic, Systematic, Sympathetic, Erudite.","A fantastic detailed overview of Jazz from its origins to the mid-sixties. Combines historical, social, academic musical,literary, entertainment, and psychological perspectives in which all components 'swing'. One caveat-too much deference accorded to psychiatrists in explaining the human behavior of Jazz musicians!"
3,Joy Adamson: Behind the Mask,A very interesting book and one that exposes in deed the Myth about Joy Adamson. Well written and one that I found I couldn't put it down once into it. Well recommended.
2,Disappointed,"My wife was anxious to get this washer and I had my doubts due to the cost and lack of performance history, but she is boss for such things.I agree with those addressing problems with:- out of balance load problems.- extra wrinkled clothes wadded and twisted up tight after spinning- thicker laundry not seeming as clean as it should beIn addition, finding the right detergent is getting to be a challenge, not to mention being over priced.So what do you do - a $1,000 and and a year later, besides not reminding your wife about your reservations in the first place.My recommendation is to buy something with a proven success record for less than half the price."
3,Cabrio Washer OK with reservations,"I purchased the (expensive) Cabrio Washing Machine several months ago. While it does have all the bells and whistles and certainly accomodates an ENORMOUS load there are some downsides. It wrinkles the heck out of many items and some items, especially sheets & towels, get VERY twisted, which makes you wonder how well rinsed they are getting in that clump. I also washed a lightweight canvas beach bag and noticed when it came out that the inside never even got wet. For the most part using less water if probably a plus, but I guess not for this item. Overall it seems to do a pretty good job getting the laundry clean.While many people seem to find an unbalanced load to be a problem, I have not experienced that.It also makes me a bit nervous to read about the many repairs and poor handling of customer compalints. Take the extended warranty on this one for sure."
2,Whirlpool Cabrio Load Balancing Problems,"Double ditto what the other reviewer said. Horrible load balancing problems with the washer particularly when washing sheets & towels. And both the washer & dryer really wrinkle the clothes. I'm happy to be using energy efficient appliances, but generally dissatified with the overall performance. Sadly."
1,Don't buy a Cabrio Washer,"This is by far the worst washer I have ever had the misfortune to use. It doesn't get my clothes clean, the most basic task of a washer. On anything but the lowest spin speed my clothes come out a mess of wrinkles and anything delicate is stretched out of shape. Someone really screwed with this design. Don't waste your time or money."
2,Gesualdo's music is a treat. This disc is not.,"This recording is not a good introduction to Gesualdo's music. It's sound is shrill and the voices are frequently out of tune. Listening to this recording reminds one of fingernails scraping a chalkboard. Other, better recordings of Gesualdo's music are avilable."
5,Excellent replacement motor,I was skeptical that it would not work. But after an easy install everything worked great. I am Vacuuming like never before.
4,Wonderfully researched and written but poorly edited.,"Mr. Isaac's book is an excellent idea and almost perfectly executed. Far from being a ""psycho-babble"" book, Mr. Isaac explores in a powerful fashion the life of a man in such a way that we very much get to know him. Carter is a man who we have all met, known, or even lived with at one time or another.The only thing that I disagreed with was the ordering of the book's treatment of Landon Carter. I would have appreciated a more chronological presentation. Still, I understand why Mr. Isaac wrote it using the organization based on subject matter, but I disagree."
1,Speculative psychology in the guise of history,"The author draws profound implications from diary passages which seldom appear to support those implications. The attempted parallel between Carter's plantation life and the revolution is labored, particularly the ""father"" analogy. Although one takes the point early in the book that King George and Landon Carter are both ""fathers,"" this point is incessantly repeated, to the point of irritation. There is little hard evidence given for the proposition that King George, who was about 24 years old, was viewed by many 50- and 60-year-old colonists as a ""father,"" or that the Revolution was symbolic parricide. The author spins simple diary statements into Carter's views of the cosmos, and this is seldom supported. The author also refers to Carter throughout as ""Landon,"" as though they were personally close. The events chronicled by the diary are, in themselves, quite interesting. It is the psychological speculation that makes the book hard to get through."
2,"Too much fluff, no substance","I found this book to provide a good introduction in the first chapter, but it was extremely wordy in describing SOA and ESB principles. The definitions were polluted with buzzwords and sales jargon to the point of being painful. It's ""marketecture.""A book that provides a concise and clear definition of SOA principles is ""Enterprise SOA: Service-Oriented Architecture Best Practices"" by Dirk Krafzig, Karl Banke, Dirk Slama. While better than Enterprise Service Bus, this book also does not entirely meet the needs of a computer professional embarking on a large Enterprise software project.I still have not found a book that provides the necessary guidance with regard to architectural principles, architectural styles, communicating an architecture effectively and evaluating/analyzing existing architectures."
4,Concise and informative,"This book provides a great review of web services, not only discussing where web services are at but how they got there. At just over 200 pages the book covers a lot of ground, but in a very concise and informative manner. The book is technology neutral (no code listings) and provides a great top-down view of this new paradigm for software development. If you have been around web services for a while-this book probably doesn't have a lot for you. However, if you are new to web services and looking for a quick and thorough what's what I highly recommend it."
3,Just a big broucher about ESB,This is just a big broucher about ESB. It states all the benefits about the ESB but it never gets into the details of how to implement an ESB.This book will become helpful when the author decides to add code examples of services implemented with ESB.The good side of the book is that it is written by a seasoned veteran in async messaging that clearly understand the field and where the specs are going. He makes a good introduction to the whole paraphernalia of messaging and a good chapter about caching strategies.
3,Good Read - Great to get a feel for Europe / Asia in the 50's,Eagerly anticipated from reviews I had read in 4wd mags. Interestingly less about the Landrovers and more about the journey and the peoples and politics along the way. It was fascinating to follow the journey on maps. Would have liked more detail about the personalities and the daily hardships.
1,You Get What You Pay For,"Kindle for iPhone Formatting IssueI dnloaded this title to my iPhone using WhisperSync and started to read it. Unfortunately, there are large chunks of text missing, some pages are more than half-way blank and, the Table of Contents is grayed out on the Menu (though if I page forward to the TOC, I can jump to the designated chapter.)The convenience of dnloading an out-of-print title very quickly and at little cost wasoffset by not being able to read the book and now having to go buy a second hand-copy of the book."
5,50+ years later,Read this 50 year ago as a teen-ager. The first book whose reading was interrupted by uncontrolled laughter. Remembered it today reading Ted Hughes new Ovid translations!
5,Sheer Entertainment,"I was about 13 years old when I discovered this book. It had been left with others on the third floor of our home. They belonged to an Uncle who was overseas during WWII. Had my parents been aware of just what I was reading, I am sure they would have confiscated the book. I was well into my 20's when I 're-discovered' Night Life of the Gods, among other Thorn Smith books, and read them again without the little girl giggles. We still laugh aloud over the delicious romps of Smith's characters. The tales are timeless and still a lot of fun. Not the least bit significant of anything; a leap from so much seriousness in print today. Read, laugh and enjoy a fine humorist."
3,"Get over it, already!","I'm usually the first person to suggest that romance heroines carry a grudge, and the last to say that it is time to let one go, but this girl was the exception. Her petty, childish temper tantrum got real old, real fast, and turned what was otherwise a delightful, funny book into a whine-fest. His infraction was small, and her revenge was better suited to a seven-year-old child than a functioning adult. Nathan was interesting, but the roamnce peaked too soon, and the whining went on for too long for this book to be a keeper. Pass this one by."
4,Pretty & Imaginative Ideas,"If you believe presentation is important and like to occasionally make your guests go ""ooh"" and ""ahh,"" this is a great book for ideas. Most ideas aren't that complicated, but make a big impact. Not really for people who want to make candles, but really for people who have plain candles and want to gussy them up. Terrific, inspiring photos!"
4,Pleasant,"This CD is somewhat of a mixed bag. In the first two Hungarian Rhapsodies of Liszt, Ormandy's orchestra plays very well, but the interpretations are somewhat stiff and unimaginative. One need only hear Bernstein's recording of No. 4 to hear some of the spirit that is missing. The performances of the Enesco Rhapsodies fare rather better. These are pieces that tend to play themselves if they are effectively conducted, and Ormandy's performances are comparable to the great interprtations by Antal Dorati. It is worth noting that Ormandy's recordings of Liszt and Enesco were made in 1957-8, and feature sound that is somewhat drier than the other recordings on this CD, although they are certainly clear and relatively full sounding. The sound in both the Alfven and the Chabrier is excellent, and Ormandy's performances here are excellent, beyond cavil. In fact, I doubt I've ever heard a better performance of Espana. So, although this CD has some limitations, at its best it is very good indeed."
1,"""Dead Men Do Tell Tales"" is much better than this!","As I read this book, I felt like the author was talking down to his readers, as if they were too stupid (or such huge fans of CSI) that they couldn't fully comprehend what he was doing throughout. Granted, not everyone picking up this book is going to have a background in police work or forensic sciences, but the individuals seeking out and reading this type of fare are above being treated like simpletons. I am a forensic anthropologist and even I felt sneered at when reading this."
5,Absolutely Gripping!,"Over the years, I have read a great many books on forensic science and this one is clearly one of the very best. The writing style is so engaging that the book is almost impossible to put down. The text is clear and flows by itself; any technical terms that are used are fully explained the first time that they are used; forensic science techniques and various processes, such as what happens to a body after death, are explained as the need arises, depending on the nature of the cases being discussed. Fortunately, each chapter presents a different case; this provides the reader with the opportunity to catch his/her breath and take a break before plunging into the next one. This book will be of great interest, not only to forensic science buffs, but also to anyone interested in thrilling crime stories. Highly recommended!"
5,You won't be able to put this one down....,"If you have any interest at all in forensic investigations, like to watch CSI, Foresnsic Files, Cold Case Files or Law and Order, this book is a MUST BUY. I literally could not put it down until I was finished! Easy read, ten case files that will have you riveted page after page. Ends with blunders in investigations."
5,Best font identifier around.,"I have found Identafont invaluable in identifying unknown fonts. It has saved me many times when a customer has come in with a previously printed job, want to use the same font, but did not know what it was. A must have."
5,"Simple, affordable, and sounds great !","If you're looking for a nice, compact, retro, simplistic 'throwback' table radio - this is the one. Perfect for a kitchen or bedroom - simple enough for mom to use and enjoy. The sound- while not Bose quality - is very clean and crisp. FM sensitivity for a tabletop is excellent. Add in the AUX input and headphone input - and they have a WINNER. The only drawback is the AM sensitivity - which isn't nearly as good as the FM. Buy one !"
1,A very annoying radio,"I bought this for my wife when it first came out. The sound and reception are fine, but it's got a faulty am/fm switch. She listens almost exclusively to AM, but it'll switch to FM on it's own. When we hit it really hard on the top, it'll usually go back to AM. Of course, this didn't begin until the warranty had lapsed. Needless to say, I recommend you look for a different brand."
5,FUN FOR THE READER AS WELL AS THE AUDIENCE,I had so much fun reading this book to my grandchildren that I have bought copies for all of them and to give as gifts to other children. They love having it read to them and I love seeing the thinking going on as they try to decide if this book really is a dog or if I am just playing with their minds again. I highly recommend this fun and charming book.
4,"Open me, I'm fun to read","This book passed the hardest test of all. My grandson squealed with delight when he opened his gift and he spent an entire evening, first listening to me read it to him, and then trying to read it to himself. It is books such as this that tempt children into a wonderful, lifetime habit of reading.Thanks to the talented author!"
5,"Clever, witty, fun","I discovered this book...er, dog, hiding out on a shelf in a used bookstore. I flipped through it and put it back and went back the next day to buy it because I couldn't get it out of my head. It's clever and fun. Has a story line and plot, but short enough to hold my 3 month old's attention all the way through. We've read it twice today already. I like the velvety front and end pages, the pop-up wagging tail and the story that takes the reader through enchanted woods, to a mountain in Germany and back to a youngster's own bedroom if he/she wishes. A new classic!"
5,It's a dog...it's a book!?!,"This book is so creative. The basic premise is that the book is not ABOUT a dog... it IS a dog. The story revolves around how he got there. It is very ""hands on"" and engages the reader immediately. It would be a fantastic gift for a little animal lover who isn't able to have a pet of his/her own. This is one dog who is allowed where other pets can't go and after the initial cost, there is no feeding or clean-up! What more could you want in a pet?"
5,FUN FUN READING,THIS BOOK IS SO CUTE! MY NEICE LOVES IT! IT IS SUCH A CLEVERLY WRITTEN STORY ABOUT A DOG THAT GOES THROUGH SO MUCH.IT IS VERY FUNNY AND A CLASSIC THAT WE WILL ALWAYS HAVE IN ARE FAMILY LIBRARY! YOU'LL LOVE IT!
1,I was appalled!,"The cover appeared so cute. However, as the saying goes, don't judge a book by it's cover. This story was great, for about 4 pages! The story includes screaming witches and wizards, not to mention a very cruel looking maiden (whom by the way, smells like fish the story says). Many pictures are just scary! I plan to return this book to the place of purchase as these are not the values I choose to teach my daughter."
2,shotty construction. arrived severely damaged by travel.,The color is exactly as expected and the mechanics work nice. However the packaging was very poor and the quality of the product was not up to the rigors of transport. 5 screws on one side pulled out of the particle board so that the table top is not connected to the frame. These screws remained in the package and caused deep gouges in the plastic top and sides. I asked for a hassle free return or $50 discount and am waiting to hear back from the company.
5,My most favourite live album of all times,"Received a vinyl copy of this remarkable live recording from my father as a youngster and it served as an excellent introduction to the genius of Frank Zappa (and his ensemble).Frank shows what he's made of and why he's recognized as one of the greatest modern composers, guitar players as well as a wizard when it came to choosing musicians for his band.Incredible tunes, fantastic live performance, funny speeches and lyrics - this album's got it all.I just got myself this gem on CD (remastering supervised and approved by Frank Zappa) and it's running non-stop in my car...And it's a historical injustice that I never got to see Frank live... ;-("
5,Zappa's best,"The other reviews have summed it up already. To reiterate, this album's a great mix of great sound, humor, compositional skill, playing and singing. I understand that people cringe when they hear ""Frank Zappa"" but if you don't like this album then there's something wrong with you."
5,best live recording of nixon era outside of nixon tapes,"This is simply the best-sounding live recording I have ever heard. Most of the disc was recorded using 16-track equipment, a rarity for 1973. It sounds like you're in a small-club, in the third-row, center. Not only is the listener hit with a jazz/funk/blues small-big band-big bang (11 members: 3 guitars, 2 keyboards, 3 percussion, 3 brass) fronted by the free world's most underrated guitarist (see solo on ""More Trouble Every Day"") but Mr. Zappa's spoken and compositional humor is at a peak. (see ""Cheepnis"") Mostly songs with words, this disc features two inconceivable-for-stage instrumentals which are effectively nailed. This album is virtual Zappa and, although no substitute for the real thing, offers a slight return to perhaps Zappa's most astute combo. A 10? This one goes to 11. Get it, folks, even if you have to hide it from the spouse."
3,Not as good as it's made out to be.,"I also think this is overrated. Get YCDTOSA Vol 2 instead. 3 of the tracks are faded out. This is a remastered disc; the rest of those tracks should have been included when the 2lp set was released on CD. Also, Cheepnis was remixed, and it stands out from the rest of the disc by how much worse the sound is. I have no idea why they did that. The original is much better. Other than that, good performances and sound quality. But the remaster should have fixed those problems."
5,if you like apostrophe and overnite sensation,"then you'll like this. my own case was that i first listened to Ap and OS and then grabbed other albums like we're only in it for the money, hot rats, sheik yerbouti etc, but was disappointed. yeah sure these albums might have funny lyrics, guitar solos, weird music etc but still is not as musically enjoyable as the above two.but R&E is much more accessible and in the vein of Ap and OS.Likewise with one size fits all."
5,Roxy and elsewhere,"This is one of my favorite Zappa albums. It was this band with George Duke, Chester Thompson, Ruth Underwood, Ralph Humphrey and the always amazing Napolean Murphy Brock that seemed to take Zappas music to a different place than other bands he had. I would buy this CD just for the song (Village of the Sun)but it is packed with many gems along side it. It is Franks amazing compostional skill at work and the talent of the fore mentioned players that can pull it off and they are doing it LIVE baby. Something that is really missing in todays performers can be found right here if you really want to look. A must for all Zappa fans and a great one for first time Zappa listeners too. Get it, don't hesitate"
5,The Magnificent Mr Handel,A superb recording - it simply has to be as it was recorded by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and conducted by the great Sir Charles Groves.A wonderful introduction to one of the great great composers - even if you have never heard his works other than the Royal Fireworks and the Water Music this will really get you going. Lots of small snippets for the beginner and yet wonderful for all Handel enthusiasts such as me.Wonderful for putting in your personal stereo and walking the dogs to! I doubt if Mr Handel would have entirely have approved. Very good also if you are down or tired - it perks you up.Superb CD - a wonderful experience - nerve tingling
4,The Magnificent Mr. Handel,"I have owned the two record set of this CD that I purchased in the early eighties. They are both well worn. This was simply the best Handel sampler I could find. And now that I own the CD - I can listen two the same tracks that were on the original recording.This is definitely a must have for all Handel admirers. The playing is strong and inspired, and the choices for the various tracks are among the best I have heard in thirty years of Handel collecting. If you don't believe me, just sample the first track ""The Entree for Alceste."" It will knock your socks off!Best of all, there are over thirty tracks of music.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
2,"Good quality, poor fit","I purchased this product for my Arctic Cat ZR 580 snowmobile. I must say it feels and looks like a high quality product. The vinyl is heavy duty and the seams are stiched with high quality upholstery thread. I was not as happy with the fit on my seat. It took a lot of heating and stretching (about 3 inches worth) to get it to fit at all and there is still a bit of seat foam showing near the front. I had already ordered a seat cover for my other snowmobile prior to installing this one, hopefully it fits better..."
5,Just What I Wanted!,"My dad was given one of these at the cancer hospital. He ""gave"" it to me when I was sick. I've since ""gave"" it back to dad as he has become worse. Thought I'd get a few of these for the important people in my life and so that I could always have one, representing the one from dad. It was awesome to find these. Thanks."
4,Making private well water fit to drink,"While it's unrealistic to think there's a single all-purpose filter that will do the perfect job on any particular well, this filter comes closer than any others I've tried. Its rather short effective life can be extended on some wells by putting a sediment-only filter upstream from it."
4,Culligan RFC-BBSA,"I installed it and the water kept getting better. I'm very glad I bought this type of filter. Compared to bottled water, it's much cheaper and I know where the water comes from."
5,Perfect,Exactly what I neeeded. Does a nice job filtering junk from ground water and keeps water tasting good. Would buy again.
4,Heavy duty cartridge filter,Product works as well as advertised. Removes sulfur for limited time depending on variable concentrations. Removes sediment and insoluble iron.
4,Culligan RFC-BBS Level 4 Heavy Duty Sediment Replacement Cartridge,Good filter Great price with subscribing to refill program Lasts for easy 75 days plus Cant beat this deal folks
5,Amazing filter!,It is amazing how much this filter catches from our well water. Saves the wear and tear on appliances with buildup of iron. Toilets stay cleaner longer. Anyone with a well system should install one.
4,Culligan RFC-BBS Level 4 HD sediment filter,"We live in rural Minnesota, our well has a high iron content. This filter doesn't eliminate the iron but does help to trap a lot of it. When you use the subscribe and save option for purchase it helps to bring the cost down and reminds you to change it."
4,Great filter!,"Have been using this filter in my GE sediment filter (I think...it's certainly not a Culligan) for a while now. It works quite well, lasts a long time, and is a good price. I have this hooked up directly to my well; in the summer, I tend to replace these every 2-3 months, whereas other months 3-4 months seems to be fine.These are MUCH better than the Level 3 filters (those ones that look like folded paper) in terms of longevity. Would highly recommend getting these...maybe a couple in case you forget to order and realize that you need to change it.Since mine is hooked up to a well, I can't speak much to the water pressure - the well pump gets water from the ground, sends it through this filter, and everything past that isn't using the pressure in the pipes in my home."
1,A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT,"Since I am a big fan of Mary Higgins Clark, and since ""Weep No More, My Lady"" was one of my favorite books, I really looked forward to viewing this tape. The entire movie is a mess. The storyline has been drastically changed, the location of the main action moved to another country (hence the French production, who unfortunately didn't have a clue about how to make this type of movie)and most distressing of all is the total lack of suspense, even to the point of not only changing the villain, but revealing the identity well before the end of the movie. Why Mary Higgins Clark's books have not been given the production values of the film adaptations of other piopular authors, such as John Grisham, remains the biggest mystery of all to me. Based on this terrible movie, I think it is time for Mary Higgins Clark to think twice before signing any agreements for movie adaptations, unless she can negotiate a contract which protects the integrity of her work."
3,Weep No More my Lady,"The video was in good condition, and mailed in a timely manner. I did not particularly like the storylines of the movie however."
4,Where has wit gone? Answer: Mostly Minnesota,"Mr. Keillor seems to have lived a charmed life. How else can one explain the characters of WLT except by attributing them to real people from his life?Despite it's ferocious wit, crisp style, and captivating storytelling ""WLT"" is TRUE, it rings of the true absurdity of personal experienceAfter reading it I envied Mr. Keillor and wanted to live in a world of his design.That is, a world of work, of people who don't fit into neat categories, a world of bawdy and outrageous humor, of sadness, of beautiful dreams and bitter realities, a world we inhabit every day and could see if a writer would sit beside us and catalog it.But why wish for that, if G. Keillor has done it for us already.And if a good mix of tears and smiles aren't your cup of tea, then just read it for the best laugh you've had in years"
2,WLT: A Radio Romance,"Although I am a Garrison Keillor fan, and although this book was recommended to me by a pastor, I was totally offended by the crudity and sexual references (I'm obviously conservative) in the first 40 pages or so and couldn't convince myself that eventually this book would be worth reading in its entirety."
4,The evolution of small yet interesting country radio station,I found this book to be a eazy and relaxing read. I sat back in my room and drifted away to a less hectic time. I found myself tuning into the station (WLT) everytime I picked up the book. The authors little extras such as the name WLT and people like Donna La Donna add a special touch to this book. I strongly suggest this book be added to your collecting right away.
2,wfoul a radio flop,"I have always liked Keillor's radio shows and was looking forward to reading WLT a Radio Romance which was given to me by a friend. If I had not wanted to offend my friend who recommended it highly I would never have finished it. I thought it was one of the most gratuitously crude books I have read in a long time. Perhaps I am just a thick skinned New Yorker but I found nothing touching or sweet about it. None of these mitfits evoked my sympathy; they all deserved each other. The only really comical chapter was the final one which made me laugh out loud. But then perhaps I was just happy to have finally reached the end of a very dark, depressing, disappointing and disgusting book."
2,Keillor's dry narrative tone cannot save this book,"This book begins as a wonderful midwestern fable, and continues that way for about four chapters: it tells the story of a burdgeoning radio station in the early days of broadcasting. Approximately one third of the way through the book, however, it flounders; it bogs down under its own weight and becomes dark and brooding, and slow-paced. This book will leave your expectations unfulfilled"
3,"Great Clips, But....","JAMES DEAN -- FOREVER YOUNG is essential viewing for anyone interested in the actor; the writer/director's done a wonderful job of assembling hard-to-find film clips, particularly from Dean's early days in live tv. The screen tests with Joanne Woodward and Paul Newman are fascinating, too. (On the strength of this scene, she'd have made an interesting Abra.) My major problem with this overview? No mention of Dean's bisexuality. True, the production team needed cooperation from the Dean estate, and many of his fans probably don't want to think closely about that side of his life. But Dean's proclivities have been extensively documented in print by now, and Liz Sheridan and Pier Angeli definitely weren't the entire story. Given that much of Dean's appeal (like that of his contemporaries Brando and Clift) tempers traditional notions of American masculinity with a feminine side, seems a terrible pity to continue mythologizing a complete heterosexuality that apparently never existed."
4,ummmmmm,"1000 words is a lot. .. ummm....""I am the Necromancer"" rules...i thought only Natz and I liked this band....i found aerosal gray machine by chance and immediately loved it....that was long ago....i only went to this site cause i was looking up Robert Wyatt and found out that the same people who love him love Van Der Graf (and Can...yeah) so i wanted to hear this again.... this goes back 20 years....ummm....too much aerosol??? i love this band. xxxrib"
3,Early Efforts From Pete and the Boys,"Apparently this was intended as a Hammill solo LP but turned into a VDGG album halfway through. Even so, it doesn't sound too much like a VDGG album at times, sounding distinctly underproduced and rather puny besides their later albums. Many of the songs are acoustic guitar based singer-songwriter material with not enough Hugh Banton keyboard magic and none of the rhythmic muscle of the Nic Potter era. That said, ""Afterwards"" is a great Procul Harum-like slice of psych-pop and ""Necromancer"" and ""Octopus"" are closer to the VDGG we know and love (well some of us do)"
3,Needs revising at this point,"While Dr. LeShan has a lot of good information in this book, I noticed that he speaks highly of Carlos Castaneda's books--which is fine because he was writing the book before Castaneda's books were shown to be fictional--but it does say something about LeShan's credibility. He spends time in the book pooh-poohing certain areas of mysticism, yet clearly is fascinated with mysticism and psychics. He offers some simple and helpful general advice and includes some beginning practices, but with so many more competent writers and teachers available now, this book is of more interest about LeShan himself and his thinking, than it is about learning to meditate."
5,Very nicely done concise reference.,For anybody new to meditation I would highly recommend this book. I found it to be very concise and at the same time detailed and easy to follow. If you are looking for nobs approach to meditation I think it's hard to come by anything better than this one.
5,The best basic training manual on meditation written.,"Although Lawrence LeShan has degrees from three universities, he writes with a simple, completely straightforward style. The first section is on the benefits of meditation. And the next section describes how to do four different kinds of meditations.If you are interested in meditation and you want the author to get right down to business, this is your book. LeShan says what he has to say in 137 pages. I'm the author of the book, Self-Help Stuff That Works, and I'm an expert on what works and what doesn't. Meditation works, and LeShan's instructions are effective and practical. I highly recommend this book."
3,Excellent overview of schools of meditation.,'How to Meditate' was fun to read giving a easy to digest overview of how one goes about meditating. I felt the book to be a bit short on why one would meditate and a little over zealous on the mystical (and even paranormal) side of meditation. And this despite his repeated insistence that a student not become side tracked when encountering such phenomenon.I personally feel that I would like to read a bit more about personal experiences with meditation. The book isn't very long and the quantity of useful information is even shorter. But the book does serve to motivate the reader to begin her quest of 'self-discovery' and then goes on to give him the tools.
3,Good as starter book,"To its credit, I must say this was the first book that inspired me because a few days before purchasing, an inner voice in me told me to return back to the store I saw it at and buy it.Can't say I was all that disappointed and in fact at least one or more of the techniques are helpful. However, one statement certainly turned out quite inaccurate in my own case. He states or at least implies that meditation goes hand in hand with being a good businessman. Well, if THAT were the case I wouldn't have lost money in the stock market some ten years after I commenced the practice! Nor would I have also lost in a business venture I had with someone where I got in over my head since I didn't grasp just how speculative the venture turned out."
4,Fast delivery,"The book came as described, in very good shape, but had a musty smell. I sprinkled baking soda into the open pages. The best part was the very fast 4 day delivery time."
3,opinion,"informative, has a few preliminary practices but 80%of it is lectures on types and systems of meditation. I say it is a must have if you dont know anything about meditation"
2,Cheap book. Old info.,"You can find better meditation info online, for free. The book is cheap, and does not include very good information. I have been meditating for years."
4,Love this multitool,"My pop has had leatherman tools for years, finally picked one up for myself a few months back and I very happy I did. Easy open, the all important locking blades, the saw and serrated blades are amazing! Great to have on you for all those little fixes! between this, duct tape and wd-40 theres nothing you can't fix!My only gripe is, and this is completely my fault, it is not all metal like I thought it would be. I figured it would be exactly the same as the supertool that my pop has, that is the only reason I gave it 4 stars...why would they put plastic in the joints where the pliers attach? why not make them all with the metal joints for greater strength and durability.anyway, I'm happy with it, gets the job done."
4,Good leatherman,It was everything I was expecting. Leatherman has a very good reputation and amazon came through on this one.
1,Never received my stuff,"This review in not for the Leatherman multi-tool because I had one, and now, I was trying to by other one. This ""one star"" is for the seller. I never received my stuff. After a week to buy the multi-tool, I sent an email to seller asking about shipping details, and they answered saying something like ""We lost the shipping details but warehouse is looking for the details""...ummm! I claimed this order, and I received my money back!"
5,Fantastic!,"I LOVE this album so much I listened to it while giving birth to my daughter....extremely helpful when you're not using pain killers lol! Seriously though, I listen to this album all the time. I've had it for several years and I never tire of it. These guys are artists in every sense of the word! This album is soothing and beautiful. Buy it you won't regret it! I also play it when giving my daughter a bath because it gets her ready for bedtime."
1,Not ready for market,"Sadly, this tool flat doesn't work. I have used mine a few dozen times. After it died, I sent it into Makita. They quickly repaired it and returned it, free of charge. It now works, but the 4-in-1 gears never meshed right, and I can tell (audible que) that the repaired tool is no better.Basically tools in this price/voltage range have high expectations. I would like to push this tool hard and have confidence in it, but find myself babying it. Really all I trust it to do, I can do with my 12V tiny hand-held drills and drivers.It would be great to be able to carry only one driver around to do all these things. We're not there, yet. There's a reason no other manufacturer has one of these on the market, the other manufacturers have the composure not to release something that can't perform to expectations."
2,Rattles itself apart,"Like an all weather tire, this expensive tool tries to do too much and comes short on all four. It literally rattled itself apart. It may be good if you want to do a few masonry holes rarely, but then you have to buy hex bit masonry bits. That, or do what I did and put a chuck on the end. This drill doesn't like that and I think the imbalance is what rattled it apart.Then I dropped it a few times and the drill broke at the handle. I am going to get the impact driver, tool only and I will probably be as happy with that as all the other LXT products I own. I think Makita over-reached on this one."
3,"good product, excellent cust. svc.","1st off, the customer service was superb...no complaints.The exfoliater lotion...nice but the same effect as a shower scrunchie...the oil after tan? Kinda too greasy.The Fake Bake itself? Not bad at all, though it did stain my bedsheets, the sheets came clean in the laundry.A little too high maintenance for the goal I was trying to achieve.Won't buy again, but this is my first time in the non-tanning bed world :)"
4,it`s ok.,"The exfoliator it`s not great, but it does its job. The spray thing for knees sucks:) The selftanner works great, and gives great color without orange, but application is hella annoying. You have to use gloves, because it stains immediately, and it takes a lot of time. The best thing is to sleep in old pijamas, so bed won`t be dirty after the night. Too bad that with the shower you loose a lot of color, but you will be still tan. No nasty smell, and it last few days.Although I am not gonna purchase again, I want something very easy and fast (like Lancome, I love it!)"
5,No Streaking!,This is the only self tanner that I have ever used that did not streak! Just followed the directions and I have an even BROWN tan. Love it!
2,Confused??,"The first time I ever purchased a bottle of the fake bake I LOVED it. It had an instant skin stain which was similar to a deep walnut color, not orangey at all. It allowed you to get a realistic instant tan and dried pretty quickly. However, when the stain washed off in the shower, there wasn't much of the longer lasting tan effect left. However, the color was perfect. When I ordered my second bottle, it was orangey - not at all realistic especially in sunlight. Wondering if they changed their formula... I hope they go back to the original as that deep walnut color is much better than the orangey color. May try one more bottle and hope for the best before going with another brand."
4,Works Great!,This stuff really works and you see results the next morning just as the product says you would. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because it is very time consuming to rub in and if you don't wear gloves it will stain your hands. I love the the smell of the body polish and dry oil. The body polish does not leave a residue and the dry oil is not greasy at all and left my skin feeling very soft. I would definitely buy this again.
5,A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!!!!,This product is awesome!!!! i highly recommend it...i'm about ready to buy my second bottle!!i got the package in 2 days and everything went perfectly!!
3,fake bake,"I think the fake bake is a wonderful tanning product if you are prepared to look dirty after you have applied it. The only down side is you need to keep re-appyling as it comes off very easy in the sun or in bed, i noticed this when i sat with my legs crossed and i had a white streak of where my leg was over the other one. i would recommend this product but not if you want to maintain a tan, its good for occasional use if you are going somehwere special."
4,Perhaps not great but really really good,"J G Farrell didn't produce great literature but he certainly wrote some wonderful stories, and could be hilariously funny as he wrote about members of the British empire facing historical disasters and pondered the past, present and future of the human race. The Singapore story is one of the most interesting to come out of WWII. Farrell gives great detail and penetrating irony verging sometimes on slapstick humor to a true horror of the mid-20th century. Great characters, great story, great history, a great read."
5,british in hot weather,this is a magnificant book. the plot and characters twist and turn with the slow realization that the end of their way a life gets closer and closer. the author creates a feeling a mood that sucks you in and you begin to feel as if you are in singapore in the prewar years and thrown into the eventual fall of singapore
5,I read it in one night!!,I could not put the book down. As the minutes ticked on into the early morning I kept telling myself one more chapter until I reached the end. It was the best book I have read in years.
3,Above Average Book,"I generally liked this book. It was fast-paced and unpredictable. The idea of a new Constitutional Convention is interesting.I agree with previous reviewers in that the book never gave any compelling reason why splitting the country was so bad. There were only two types of Western characters: evil schemers and the mindless masses who followed them. Surely there was at least one intelligent person west of the Mississippi who had logical reasons for seccesion.On a side note, the editors review states this story is set in the late 80s, and even one or two other reviews here seem to think the story is 20 years old. There are references to the second president Bush and the second war in Iraq, so clearly it was set in 2005 or later."
1,Good plot wasted,"The plot has so much promise, but it was all wasted on the antics of the protagonist, a journalist who single-handedly uncovers the plot, fights off death-squads and assassins, and still has time to get the girl. And the head villain is a one-dimensional stereotype.Why the general population of the West should be on the edge of supporting secession before the book even starts is only given a cursory glance. And no good reason for not splitting the country is ever explored, other than it would inconvenience the big cities on the East coast.Disappointing book in multiple ways."
5,Eternal Fire,"Calder Willingham is from my home town of Rome, Ga. That having been said, his book has to rank as one of the southern literary masterpieces of the 20th century. Equally as engaging or entertaining as anything by Faulkner, McCullers or any other ""well known"" southern writer. His characterizations are powerful and so real. Coming from the same area, I know these people. As a matter of fact, this book is so ""real"" it was banned in my home town all of the years of my growing up. I never encountered Willingham's book until an adult in California, although I had always heard about it. His other books, including ""Rambling Rose"" are equally strong. Little Big Man, starring Dustin Hoffman was one of his strongest movie works as was The Graduate which he co-wrote with Buck Henry. Enjoy!!"
4,Perfect selection of lenses,"This was a great product for the price.I am a every weekend shooter and find I need to change my lenses every few weeks. My last similar pair broke after 1 year, these seem like better quality but I am still treating them gently.All in all I am satisfied with these glasses and you can beat the many choices in lenses and the great hard case they come in."
3,Maverick is a bust compared to the Dude,"I own two pair of SunBuster's Model ""Dude"" shooting glasses and they are great except my oldest pair needs new temple pieces. Since all models are guaranteed for life I asked SunBuster to replace my frame and temples under the lifetime guarantee and was told that the company that made the frame and temples for the ""Dude"" no longer makes them so Sunbuster could not honor its lifetime warranty. I ordered the Maverick model to replace the worn out Dude model I have. The Maverick is cheap and its quality is far below the quality of the Dude so I will not wear the Maverick model glasses."
4,Sunbuster maverick,nice glasses great value! Amazon had the best price!!! I would not have been happy if I had paid 40 to 50% more.. I wish each of the lenses would be darker. that would make them a better product and more affective!
3,A one-sided approach,"Unlike ""The U.S. Mexican War"" by the Christensens, this book has a clear ideological bias, trying hard to find pride and justification where historians and politicians have been unable to find them. This one-sided approach to the war perhaps makes it an interesting reading for the intellectually curious, but a waste of time for the reader seeking neutrality. The reader of other books about the Mexican War will find that the author strategically occults historic data basic to make a complete the picture of the times and the events that led to this war."
5,Not for Dummies,"Professional InfoPath 2003 is definately not ""InfoPath for Dummies"". This in-depth look at the behind the scenes technology of InfoPath is an XML-lovers dream - excellent details regarding how InfoPath uses xml technology. If you are looking for a ""how to use InfoPath"" book, this isn't it. If you are a programmer who wants or needs to know every detail of how InfoPath uses xml, you've found the right book."
4,A book worth reading!,"I have read one review that conveys the notion that not many solutions are provided by Stanley Hauerwas' writings. This kind of review only highlights the very things that Dr. Hauerwas is combating; somehow, ""American values"" are equated with Christian values to the point were the average person cannot discern between the two. One must try to eliminate this type of thinking before one can see that Stanley Hauerwas is offering feasible and necessary solutions.This book will certainly challenge one's way of thinking. If one will remain open to Hauerwas' assertions, then one just might find that this book is not so ""shocking."""
2,"Product is not sturdy, good starter frame.","I purchased this mainly because of the price, and the claim of sturdy construction. On receiving product, I unpacked it and looked over the frame. Several pieces were bent, though I was able to straighten these. More importantly was the corrosion present on several pieces. Black Matte paint was gone in these sections, from wear against each other. The construction itself is not a solid weld all the way around, but is only single spot welded in place. This was DEFINITELY not a 300 dollar frame- I am very glad I got it on sale +shipping. Had I paid full price, I would be boxing it back up, and returning for a refund.Oh, and there is NOT a canopy included with this bed."
5,Flying With a Smile and a Chuckle,"Anyone who can take a chapter and devote it on inflight deaths and still have me laughing has my thumbs up. This book was well written, insightful and gave me renewed hope that there is some personality in the airline folks yet. I enjoyed both of his books thoroughly and now feel that it is possible to find humor and intrigue out of anything in life. My favorite chapter was ""Going Dutch"" I laughed so hard I nearly had an accident, enough said."
4,A New Attitude At A Different Altitude,"I was in an airplane on a lengthy delay when I got to the chapter about extended delays called ""Can't Handle the Truth"" I laughed so much I am sure the flight crew thought I was crazy. It was as if the author was guiding me through my misadventures in-flight, story by story. I guess I always dreamed of what it would be like to be a crewmember and now I have a better understanding, good and bad. Okay, this book isn't going to win a nobel prize, but I feel in some way this is what's missing in books these days, humanity and a real sense of the author. What a twist it was to discover that his wife is a pilot, that's one for the records, female pilot married to male flight attendant? They have fun with that point in the book as well. Humor is all around us and A Frank Steward (nice pen name)makes me believe that it can be found up in the skies as well. Definetly a fun and interesting book. One question, where are all the fun Frank Stewards when I fly?"
5,We Love Junie!,"My 3rd grader reads and re-reads Junie's books. Despite the negative feedback about Junie's grammar and sentence structure and ""disrespect"" we thinks she's fabulous. Oh yes. So is Barbara Park."
1,Junie B. Jones and Her Terrible Grammar,"My daughter-in-law mentioned my five year old granddaughter liked Junie B. Jones. I ordered Set 1 for my home-schooled six year old grandson and Set 2 for the granddaughter for whom it was requested. Then I visited the children and read one of the books. Junie B. is supposed to be a kindergartener, but her use of English, especially pronouns, made me want to weep. My grandson started one book; neither he nor my daughter was charmed by naughty Junie or the way she speaks. I regret buying the books--especially for children I love."
2,"Cute stories, but they make it hard on parents","I've got nothing against Junie. Her stories are cute and they are our daughter's favorites. But the grammar is so bad, it has had a noticeably negative impact on our daughter's speech. I have to explain over and over that ""bestest"" and ""hided"" are not words. No matter how amusing the stories may be, I recommend that parents do not buy these books. There are plenty of fun books out there that don't teach bad grammar habits."
2,didnt even get the whole set,Horrible! I only recieved 3 of the 4 book set. They said I could send it to them but they cant replace it.
5,junie b,My niece loves the series. She reads far advance for age 7. The books are wonderful. I will purchase the next series soon.
4,My 6 year old loves these,"Great addition to our collections of books, very cute and enjoyable stories to read right before bed. My 6 year old loves these books because he can relate to the stories with him being in kindergarden."
1,Bordering on professional negligence,"I wanted to like these books, but after listening to my Kindergartner read a few pages, I had to stop her. Throughout the books, young readers will find both glaring and subtle grammatical errors, such as ""me and Grace"" and ""I did a giggle"". Additionally, many of the scenarios and topics addressed in the stories are of questionable appropriateness (e.g., discussing ""cops resting [sic] drunk people."" While I respect creative liberties generally in representing a Kindergartner's use of language, if the purpose of literature is to enhance literacy while also creating rich contexts for such learning, then these books accomplish just the opposite. How can we teach our children to speak and write correctly and compellingly if these are the examples with which we provide them? I'm sorry if I come across philosophically, but I feel nearly betrayed by the professional negligence demonstrated by this author."
3,My almost 5 year old daughter LOVES Junie B. Stories,"But I am having a hard time approving of some of the content. The stories are really cute and fun. Junie B. is a character that kids can relate to and laugh with. When my husband and I read them we have to edit some of the name calling, bad grammar, and story lines. We don't want to introduce our daughter to boyfriends and boy-girl relationships before she's ready. We don't tolerate name calling in our home and Junie B. does a lot of name calling in several of her books. When the grammar is just bad I also edit the reading.So...while I really appreciate the stories and the comedic story lines I don't think I'm going to encourage Junie B. books anymore. I'd like to find something else with equally as fun stories but without the previously mentioned hangups."
1,bah..worst album,"dont bother about this one. I thought , since the production date was 1993 , might be a cool band... but it is some Belgium/ Franco band...not worth your pennyI Threw the CD Away..It was that bad"
5,Perfect for a rainy day...,This is nice looks really good and is not that hot since here is mostly rain but is kind of warm os this is perfect.
5,Fantastic book!,I read this as a child and could not put the book down. It is a great classic; one I will enjoy reading with my kids!
5,This book is unforgettable and life-changing,"Every Catholic child should read this book. This book shows the best of the Catholic faith: spirited courage, deep love, and selfless sacrifice. And the story is very child-friendly and appropriate for readers of any age. I read it in 4th grade and it gave me so much pride and faith in my Catholic religion. I am now a college sophomore and I still remember this book fondly. It is a beautiful and meaningful introduction to Catholicism, religious persecution, and martyrdom, while still remaining age-appropriate."
5,An excellent and memorable book for adolescents.,"I join the reviewer from Indiana in praising this book, which I remember well although it has been 35 years since I read it (3 times) in 7th and 8th grade. An intriguing adventure story. I will be giving it to my 2 children in a few years, and hope they will enjoy it half as much as I did."
2,too much stuff!,"Like most ""down alternative"" pillows, whether man-made or natural fiber, this pillow is too overstuffed to truly behave like a real down pillow. The claim, ""adjustable comfort"" is false because of this. What you really get is a very firm and thick pillow with no more adjustability than a standard polyester rolled batting pillow. I can't imagine how overstuffed the high-loft version would be. The fiber might be more down like with half the stuffing, but it is hard to tell without ripping it open and removing it yourself. It still might not adjust like down.I would only give it 1 star, but gave it 2 because it is a natural fiber, and that might be helpful to some."
3,Not enough fluff!,"The Ingeo pillow is a nice down alternative pillow but just not fluffy enough. If you stack two together like I did, then you will love it!"
3,Very FIRM!,"There are no options with this brand on the fill, so be prepared to open it up and take some out like I did. This would be considered a side sleeper pillow in the regular market..the firmest. Wish they had a stomach sleeper version so I wouldn't have to do surgery on mine. But good pillow, and inovative fiber fill."
2,Fair,"Fairly good, could of been much better. Very nice Photography, very limited information about things to do with too much emphasis on certain stores and hotels instead of sights. Note - This video is only about 22 minutes long. Subtract the intro and closing and you only have about 15 minutes of usable information."
5,A Gift,Another book purchased as a gift and read personally. It was well presented and worthy of being given as a present.
5,The best one ever!,"I've read a number of translations of The Iliad and a couple of The Odyssey. This version of The Iliad is, hands down, the most readable and vigorous, reminding me of the reasons I was so attracted to these stories as a young boy reading ""Heroes of Troy."""
5,Story of the West,"What more can be said?This is the only translation I have ever read--it was lucid and beautiful, and there is nothing better to say so I will leave it at that."
5,Review of Fagle's Iliad and Odyssey,"My Credentials:Admittedly, less than appealing. I have never read any translation other than Fagles's.Review:The books open with an extensive and scholarly introduction to the history and context of the poems. Fagles's tone is certainly epic. I have no qualms about his writing style, which I found fascinating. A standard rythym would might have been nice, but, again, a brilliant rendering overall. I cannot speak to his accuracy as a translator.There are maps in the opening section, but I made little use of these, so I can't speak to their quality or lack thereof.I prefer footnotes to endnotes, which in this book are extensive and useful. Also, the introductions open with a discussion of Homer, which is essentially the same in both books. This is ultimately unavoidable for the publisher, but may be avoided by the reader who doesn't wish to read about modern bards in Yugoslavia more than once."
5,The Iliad and the Odyssey,Requested by my 14 year old grandson for Xmas. Said grandson has been well taught by his Latin teacher and Rick Riordan's books about children of the Greek and Roman gods doing GREAT THINGS. He loved the Odyssey and is now on the Iliad and wanting more.
5,Epic Style,"What distinguishes the Fagle's Translation of Iliad from dozens of other great translations, is he put the sense of ""epic"" into its English version. I read and reread it, I can not get over how it achieves to give you a sense of solidity and all encompassing grandeur, in a scale that evokes heroism ,fate, courage, beauty, adventure in every line. I do not read Greek, but I can only imagine if an ancient bard who sang these lines in an amphitheater would want to achieve, what Fagle's translations does in reading all by yourself, alone."
3,What in the world was Viking/Penguin thinking?,"Both editions of this box set - The Iliad and The Odyssey - are, of course, superb translations. The dust jackets and the box set are nicely designed as well. But this is where I'm afraid the good news comes to a rather abrupt end. The quality of the paper is really poor (reminiscent of pulp fiction or cheap newspaper quality -- sue me, but I really don't care if it's acid free or not), of a rather yellow color, and all the pages are irregularly cut (have so-called deckle edges), i.e. there is no smooth edge to the pages as one is used and entitled to even with much cheaper books. It leaves one with this question: What in the world was Viking/Penguin thinking? Disappointing, given the price range of this edition."
1,"Good, until it breaks","Well, it worked very well while it lasted. I used it only at my work PC, so I barely retract it. Works well tho. After about 8 months, the connector can no longer keep a stable connection. One wiggle and it'll disconnect, and if you're unlucky, like me, it will corrupt your music/video and everything will disappear. To fix this, you'll need to SSH in and delete the iTunes_Control (which had all my unrecognizable music) and re-sync."
1,Defective Retractable Ipod USB Syncnchg Cable,"Cable, Retractable Ipod USB SyncnchgStopped working the second time I used it. The 2008 Mercury Sable doesn't recognize it and my desktop computer doesn't recognize it. I plan to buy a straight cable and try it before I go to my Ford Dealership."
2,This Thing is Huge,Beware this is not a small cable. The housing is thicker than my iPod Classic and the whole thing dwarfs my wife's iPod Nano. The sync cable that comes with the iPod is smaller to pack.
4,its so cheesy you cant help but laugh,I was bored when I stumbled on this one. The props are handmade the actors are hilarious the dialogue and humor are great and the skits are fun. From murderous hands to reams of unhappy ghosts weird paintings and creatures from Asian folklore you will be entertained. You should give it a look see if you want something zany and outside the box
5,Weavings,If you like easy listening with a twint you will like this music. Great cd. Fell in love with the music the fist time I heard it.
4,Good price,My other thermometer died and I couldn't find a replacement. This is better than my original one and though I haven't used it yet I'm sure it will work just right.
5,Cost control for new homebrewers,"I'm new to home brewing and still learning and fighting the urge to buy everything. This was a really good purchase. Cost was so low, I had no reservation about buying it. It performed great with my first batch and I expect it to be cne of my favorite tools."
5,Royal Cash Register,"This Register has been one of the best investments for my business. The price was as low as a cash box. Don't think twice about this register, it very good and easy to use."
3,Cash Register,"The unit does work, but it came with almost no ink...now I have to figure out where to get the ink roller. Also, the drawer key doesn't work. The main reason I bought this was so I could have a locked box"
3,Poor customer service,Customer service is very poor. We did not get registerOn time to open our business . We had to buy one locally.I spoke with someone from the company and theyStated they would send return label to ship backIt has been several weeks and have not receivedIt I have called several times and emailed withNo response
5,The truth is always stranger than fiction,"What a great look into the makings of this wild group. At first I thought it wasn't real, but now I am convinced it is. Either way, it's funny and sometimes verges on Curb Your Enthusiasm type of awkward and uncomfortable...but in a good way. George Segal is amazing as always, but was surprised how good the Master Tav and Mc Meshugenah guys were as well. I suppose it's just who they are (a little disturbing), but my favorite was Jewdah...the menorah on the Volvo was calssic!"
3,Why of Why Did I Buy This Silly Video????????,"A couple of months ago, I was visiting a daughter in Milwaukee. A resident in my daughter's apartment building recommended the grilled eggplant and habanero cheese sandwich at a restaurant across the street from her apartment building. We both ordered the sandwich. At first bite, it was delicious; by the third bite we were both laughing at how terrible the sandwich tasted.Chutzpah is the cinematic version of that awful sandwich. During the first couple of minutes, it seemed pretty funny. By the fifth minute the joke was stale. I sat through it, really wondering why some apparently talented people had wasted money, time, and effort producing this detrious.If someone has a copy, give it a peek, or buy it as a gift for someone you don't really like very much."
5,Der Kommisar Schneider ist gu-hut!,Helge Schneider: unerreicht. Seinen Humor liebt man entweder oder man findet ihn total bescheuert und kann nichts damit anfangen. Ich zähle mich zu ersteren und kann ihn für schräge Humoristen nur allerwärmstens ans Herz legen. Kaufen! Kaufen!
2,Fragile construction,"Lighter is very attractive, however the housing that holds the latch to keep top closed is plastic and broke within 3 weeks of very light use. I only use this lighter on our boat and at the beach. Disappointed that it did not hold up any better. I tried contacting Essential Gear via e-mail several days ago and have not heard back from them to date."
1,Buy something else,"The cover sticks half the time, so it won't open reliably, and it will never accept a full refill. AAMOF, every refill will accept less and less fuel to the point where now it hardly accepts any and thus is no longer any good."
5,Always use to protect carpet when working,"This product is exactly what we needed to keep new carpet clean while remodeling. Our tenant asked for new carpet, we put it in, he moved and trashed the place. The bath enclosure had to be resurfaced, the bath vanity, sink & faucet replaced, the kitchen counters replaced, a new sink, fridge, stove & d/w. We did all that work and the carpet was protected fully. It is sticky and a lot like sticky contact paper but a little easier to use. We did not have an applicator, just rolled it off the roll. Easy. The amazon pricing was very good, if you buy a tiny roll from a moving company or moving truck rental it ends up costing a lot more."
5,They need more like this one,"This is a fast up beat album. Less background noise than than Vols. 1,2 & 3. Since recorded live much more refined placement of ""mikes"" I had the original LP(lost it to my blk. Lab, he ate it) When I heard they put it on cd.it was purchased immediately. I have listened to it for 41 years. If you enjoy The Clayton Bandw/ Milt Jackson, Bob Florence you'll love this one....TT"
1,Don't be fooled!,"This Seller's images lie!They provide only white, black, heather grey, and oatmeal colored socks."
2,Update from original review,"I reviewed this item a while ago and was very pleased with this product, but.... These socks are not cheap (price wise) but I wanted the quality so I pay. I ordered the ""deluxe"" slouch sock so I would get the thicker ones that do not wear out or get holes after a few months. I got the same ones that were being sold as a cheaper version, are very thin and not as good. So basically I got ripped off. Last order for you Barry."
1,Poor Reception,"The reception on this phone was only good within about 15 feet of the base. We used it for a week, but it never got better. It was sporatic, so may be associated with the 2.4 frequency rather than the phone itself, but regardless I sent it back. This was to replace a 900Hz Sony that has always worked fine, but will no longer hold a charge very long."
1,Avoid,"Never had problems like this with any other phones. Sometimes the phone rings, sometimes it doesn't (the satellite handset never rings; at least it's consistent). Too often, when dialling out, you get a message that says ""try again"". Now, after only three months and change, some of the lettering on the ID screen is fading out. Not good."
3,Murder = Redrum,"Not quite finished w/ the book, somewhat dry writing , needs more ""oomph"" to bring it to life, since this crime was particularly grizzly. The cast of characters, especially Rita and Zelenin weren't portrayed with enough dimension for me to have any immediate gut response or care too much about. This reader assumes they(Gluzman & Zelenin) will be convicted and thats it. I did like the opening statements of the prosecutor (the woman w/ the $30 haircut) and the description of Hochheiser(sp?) the photos were a plus ..""Could have been a contender"""
4,A Thorough description of the crime and capture. Good job,"Mr Hays explains and describes the brutality of the crime, the problems law officials had with circumstancial evidence and their ability to convict in spite of it . It was an interesting read with a thoroughness that belies an understanding of the problems associated with crime conviction."
2,Updated Info,"Hey Tim, Let's hope you have updated information when your book is re-released. Dave Wartelsky BCPD WSAR"
1,Horrible interpretation of facts.,"What Tim Hays does in this book should be considered a crime by itself.The book is not well written, and has numerous holes. Clearly the writer did not do all the research he should have on the subject. His writings refelct an erronous interpretation of the fact, likely because he did not bother to get all the facts.Final word of advice, don't buy this piece of trash, there are better books out there. I'm sorry i spent my money on it."
2,Get your facts straight Tim!,"Hey Tim, It's back to journalisum 101 for you! I was one of the divers assigned to the Yakov Gluzman dive. You would think that basic information should be right. It was not the Bergen County SHERIFFS Department that recovered the body parts of Yakov Gluzman, it was the Bergen County POLICE Department! How about a little credit, where credit is due! While I, personally do not want credit for being on the dive team that located all the body parts, I think my agency and the team deserved better. It boils down to basic investigative reporting, so get your facts straight. I guess it dosen't matter to you, because you sold a book! Bravo!"
4,Good pan,"This is a big pan. I use it twice a day and it hasn't scratched, even when I used metal. The only problem I found and it is probably my fault; the direction say 'not to use' spray ons like pam, etc.because it leaves a coating. I was using pam and now I have to keep using it because if I don't, the food sticks. Like I said, I probably messed up the pan. I usually have to replace my no stick fry pan yearly because the coating scratches and so far, this doesn't have a scratch."
1,Poor quality product,"Regulator will not hold settings, especially the lower ones required for smaller areas. The thing is also very hot! Enough to burn your fingers when adjusting (or attempting to) the output. Bad Product! Contacted the seller.....all I received from them was attitude."
4,Makes my car sound mean,And that's pretty cool for a little old Saturn Vue. Definitely experienced some free up of horsepower and it's easy to clean. Plus no more filter replacements! It would get a perfect 5 stars but the mounting spot was a little off and I had to bend it to make the bolt fit on it. But it cleans up the engine bay well and overall is a really good product.
5,Incredible Saxophone Trio,"Amazing CD version of 1982 Vinyl LP from Moers Music in Germany. Excellent digital mastering on this CD. 8 great tracks on this disc.Fantastic artistic playing, harmonious and easy to listen to. A real musical genius, Odean Pope is from Philadelphia and has played with many great musicians.I also recommend ""The Saxophone Choir"" available from Amazon.I do not understand why more of his catalog is not in print, especially in Japan where American Jazz is more popular.For a complete information you can visit his web site."
4,Upside Down Kids - Helped Me!,"I have three children with dyslexia and finding a book that helps them understand their problem without the scientific jargon is hard. This is an enjoyable read and helped me understand what the kids are going through. It also shows that an understanding teacher with a heart of gold can truly make a difference to their lives. More teachers should be taking the time to read books like these and they should be more understanding of the ""New"" children entering their classrooms.Congratulations Dr Levinson for a wonderful book it helped me and my children and I recommend this book to all parents that have dyslexic children."
3,Why buy the set?,"The 3 stars are for THIS PRODUCT AS IT IS PACKAGED and is NOT a rating of the movies themselves or a rating on the quality of the video and audio of the disks. While all 3 of these films are fantastic (I was completely blown away by American Gangster and Eastern Promises), do yourself a favor, save 16 bucks and buy the Blu-Ray versions of these separately."
3,Good value for the price,"Good points:-- Low price.-- Easy to use.-- Pretty good picture quality overall, but tends to overexpose in very bright sunlight, such as around a swimming pool.-- Nice set of mounting accessories.-- Works well underwater.Bad Points:-- Hard to tell where the camera is pointing due to lack of viewfinder. Best approach is to sight along the top of barrel.-- Sound is terrible unless camera is underwater, although others have suggested this can be cured by removing the waterproof membrane over the microphone. Of course, then it's no longer waterproof."
3,atc2k review,pros:cheap $46.98 from company called smart save at amazon.comeasy to use with all the attachment optionscame with free 1 gb sd card and nice camera pouchno wires to worry aboutwaterproof to 10 feetgot it in 3 dayscons:poor soundneed lots of light for videosvideo is not 30 frames/second it's actually 26 fpsgood rugged camera (outdoor). won't mind beating it up. price was cheaper compared to other bullet cams that cost twice as much with the same specifications.
4,Great Sports Camera,"This is a great little sports camera. I mount it on an outrigger of a six man canoe and we evaluate paddling strokes for racing. It is compact and can be mounted anywhere. I wash it down with fresh water when I'm done. The sound portion of it is a little weak, but the video is pretty good. You have to just point it in the right direction because there is no monitor on it. It is simple and great for the price."
4,Action Cam review,"I bought this for off-road motorcycle riding. For a camcorder costing under $100, it works just fine. The controls are too small to see really well through the ""window"" on it, but once to get a feel for how to set it, it's simple controls are easy to understand. Thus far the only problem I see with it is wearing it on a helmet, the microphone on it gets a lot of wind noise. I'll try it next on the handlebar mount provided with it, but I expect the recording will be shakier because it will be absorbing the bumps of rough off road riding.If you're expecting high quality video from this, pass on this one, but if you are in a situation where you fall or drop the unit, you're at least not destroying a $500 camcorder. Also, because of it's size, it's less obvious that you're using a camcorder, possibly making for more natural, candid recordings."
3,1st person view/head-cam,"I tried using this for a bike ride ... and there's mixed feelings.1) i had no display to view my video so i had no clue (until after the fact) that what i was recording was clipped or at an angle. Maybe a laser guide and/or a level to help.2) since the cam is so small, it was hard to keep the camera as still as possible, which caused a video so jerky that it makes the Blair Witch Project a joke. Standing still and moving it is fine ... but once in motion on the bike, it was starting to make me feel dizzy.3) On the positive side, it is a neat way to capture video doing things you normally cannot (ie. biking, snowboardin, etc...). And for the price that Amazon gives, it's a decent deal."
1,Not worthed a dollar,"This is my second Oregon Camera. First 2 were the ATC1000 (their first camera). I have used those 2 cameras for many years on my motorcycles (Honda ST1100 and ST1300)... I mean... for almost 3 years. Now I decided to upgrade and went for the ATC2K, but I notice that this camera does a lot of wobble... a lot!I have the same bike... the same mounted place... I ride the same roads, but the footage I get for this new camera is horrible... not worthed to watch or edit...What happened?... is this an error or broken camera or you Oregon Scientific guys didn't improve your product?Their advertise that this is a ""play hard, record everythig"" camera, but I can't imagine doing any of the sports they mention if a simple riding my touring bike is not working well.They used to have a great product with the ATC1000... but this one is ready to go to the trash can."
2,Save up for a better option,"I wish I would have listened to a few of the reviews that said to save up for a better option. This thing is REALLY bad in low lighting. The videos I have in low lighting are very pixelated and not even worth while. And when I say low lighting, I mean not a super sunny clear day. If it's as dark as a lit room of your house you will not get quality shots. I have yet to use this on a nice sunny day, but so far I'm a bit disappointed. I couldn't imagine using it for trail riding going from light to dark. I realize it was only $90 or so, but it's still very worth while to save up and spend an extra chunk of cash.The only redeeming qualities of this thing is that it seems to stand up to shocks decently."
2,A cheap toy,Decent price. OTOH what you get is a USB1.1 device. It is not quite easy to find how to attach it to bike helmet and get the right picture that is focus to your way and make it fixed so it is not weaving all the time. Usability of controls is not very exciting too.You can take some videos with this and learn what you will expect from your next camera.
2,"Great Price, poor picture.","THIS CAM IS A GREAT IDEA, BUT IT's FRAMES PER SECOND ARE TO SLOW. THE VIDEO STOPS AND GOES WAY TO MUCH. I HAVE TRIED THE 30 FRAMES PER SECOND AND ALSO THE FIFTEEN FPS. NOTHING SEEMS TO HELP. I WOULD NOT BUY THIS AGAIN AND WOULD PAY MORE FOR BETTER QUALITY."
3,Very useful and handful but very medium quality,"very small, very easy but cannot expect the same quality as a camera or video camera"
1,Very disappointed,"I would not recommend this camera based on several design flaws:1) The picture quality is very grainy, and at the highest resolution settings and in bright sunlight it gets no better. It also does not record 30 fps at the 30 fps setting, but something more like 20 fps.2) The lens angle is a medium length focal length, which means that you will not capture much of the scene but rather a narrow view, which, as it is a longer focal length will be quite jumpy even with slight camera movement.3) The biggest issue...the camera's SD card slot has no way of securing the SD card, so with moderate vibration such as on a bicycle or motorcycl handlebar, the SD card will shake out of its slot resulting in the camera stopping its recording.I like the idea of the camera, and its design seems very rugged. The incuded mounts are also very thorough. I'm returning the camera and will look towards something else - completely dissatisfied in the ATC2K."
4,ATC2K Camera / Helmet Cam,"Took this camera to war... Did OK but some of the plastic parts took a beating from the ruthless and relentless sun, then the horrible winters in the mountains and it broke down a little. But a little rigging here and there and it was fine every time I needed it. The waterproof part worked out for me as it also kept out dirt and sand , snow... Just get a little more memory and it's an inexpensive way to record.I can't seem to get spare parts for it now that I need it again. That's the only problem I can report. Still trying and have few things to still fix. Good, tough, simple little camera I enjoy it still."
2,"Not worth the time, maybe worth the money","I have owned this camera for over a year now and will stop using it from now on. The poor video quality is just not worth the time and effort. At first I thought it would be good enough for YouTube but the bad quality video you shot to begin with then gets reduced further by YouTube making the end result simply terrible. The camera deals especially bad in darker, poor lit places, such as riding your bike in and out of tree shadows.The sound is completely unusable, just walking with it will sound like you're in the middle of a tornado.The only good thing I can say about this action cam is the amount of ways you can attach this camera to whatever it is you're into. It comes with a load of straps and mounts. BUT for an action cam I'm now looking elsewhere."
2,Eh,I bought this to strap on mike bike and motorcycle. It worked OK but after a couple of motorcycle rides the sound went out. Too much vibration maybe? Now I can't even get it to turn on. Not very durable and not worth the money for the amount of use I got from it.
3,weak plastic mounts very brittle,the camera itself is excellent. video quality is great. the mounting swivel however is junk. very brittle plastic that breaks at the first hint of tightening. i expected as much & didn't have any hope that the manufacturer would replace it with anything other than another brittle plastic piece of junk so i super glued it pretty permanently in place @ my preferred angle.great paintball gun-cam.
2,Veru bad device,"I buy one for use in the practice of MTB, but I lost my money, the video is bad, and the audio also is bad. I put it in the trash."
2,Not good,"The only good thing about this camra is the video quality. for 80 dollars it actuly has decent image quality. the sound is horable. when the camra is sitting still you can't hear your self talking if your more than a foot or two away from it. but even when you are close upto it, it sounds like you whispering. when the camra is moving it make this really loud noise on the video that amlost sound like something grinding. i have use this camra on my mountainbike, mopeds, and even my Jeep, and it makes the same noise. also this camra eats up batteries like it noones buisness. if the battery gets low it will cut off and if you were recoding when it cuts off you lose the whole file, it dosn't just stop recoarding. overall this camra is not worth 80$ in fact i probly would be skeptible about buying it if it was for only 20$. Don't buy this or the tony hawk cam, if you really want a decent hemlet cam just save you money and buy a real one, you'll be disapointed if you buy this"
1,Company did not perform,Have not received product due to company and DHL error. Have not received any response to the explinations sent. Now Amazon and company are threatening to charge for shipping and restocking fee for items not received. Still not resolved and it is more than 1 month later.
4,good product,At least it is a very resistant camera. I am a mountainbiker and i have fallen from my bike several times but the camera remains intact. it is amazing how tough it is.nontheless it lacks of a rear screen to see what you are filming. besides the sound it is very poor.anyway it is prety damn good for extreme sports.
4,"Reasonable ""Action"" Cam for a low price","Yes there is no viewfinder, yes the buttons are hard to press, yes the waterproof mic makes it sound like you're underwater even when you're not, and yes the quality is not stellar, but, let's be clear, this is an inexpensive waterproof video camera that can take some abuse and keep working. I've dropped it into pools, strapped it to scooters, and tossed it around and it still works. I haven't had it that long, but it records video just fine. Low light videos are not good. And when it makes the transfer from underwater to above, make sure there aren't big drops stuck on the lens or it'll distort your video.Overall, it's a fine camera for the price, the only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because, well, yeah, the video quality is not great. But the piece of mind knowing that you can record yourself doing crazy things and not worry about the camera getting hurt is great!"
3,Okay for the money,"You can't expect a whole lot from this camera. if you are moving the camera quickly, it seems like it does not refresh fast enough or something--the picture cant keep up with fast movements. I bought it for downhill mountain biking and the changes in light coming through the trees makes it difficult to make much of the picture. Also be sure you dont tighten the mount too much, i did and the threads seized making all the mounting options useless. I tried contacting Oregon Scientific by email to purchase a replacement about 1 week ago--still no reply."
4,Great Durable sports cam,Length:: 2:51 MinsA simple video to show camera and accessories next to bicycle.
4,Great camera.,"Length:: 3:25 MinsThis is a jetsking video made using this product on Lake Washington in Seattle in October 2007. As you can see, it works really well and we're quite happy with the product. In fact, I have since recommended it to a bunch of friends who have all bought it and love it too. We've got a bunch of similar videos listed on youtube (account= rothstafari) and all of the jetsking ones were made with this camera.A 2 gig SD card provides you with an hour (approx) of footage at the best resolution. This is a great feature. The camera is durable and works very well.My only issue with the camera is the placement of the lens relative to the camera body. Because the lens is slightly set into the body (presumably for protection), water tends to pool at the base of the lens obstructing the view and making the end result look bad. We're going to try something like rain-x next time out and hopefully it will help."
2,Great idea but poor video quality,"Who wouldn't love a camcorder that is small, durable and shoots good quality video? Unfortunately the ATC 2K is not the solution. Checkout the videos on YouTube that were made with the ATC 2K before you buy it (search atc 2k). It seems to work OK when there is minimal movement but when the camera is moving the video is very grainy and jumpy. I found the following mountain biking video[...]be particularly useful since it looks like the photographer did everything correctly, yet the quality is still poor.Kudos to Oregon Scientific for the idea. Keep working on it."
5,Best camera ever,"Man! This camera is great! I mounted it on the handlebars of my foreman. We went riding at night. As long as there is someone in front of you to reflect the light back to the camera it works great! You dont see anything if you are the man in front. Video quality is very good. For high quality sound you must remove the waterproof cover at the back of the camera. This camera is tough too. It has been abused under me and still works fine. If you are in inhospitable places and want a camera that you dont have to worry about with very good performance, this is for you. Check out footage on youtube."
2,Great item for a motorcycle tour,"I had this little DVR mounted on my left handlebar for a 2-week, 4000 mile bike trip from Tennessee to New England and back, and came home with about 20 hours of nice video, which I was able to edit in iMovie on my Mac. I can't believe the value of this thing!"
4,oregon scientific camera,"no better camera for the money and the features. sound quality is low and the camera tends to be a little jumpy, but once you get the hang of it, you will enjoy it. i used mine to video a girl scout canoe trip.works great underwater."
4,helmet cam,"this camera is definetely one of the best out there,the only down side i could find is stability. when riding my bike down hill the camera moves too much and is hard to get a good image. some sort of stability device in the camera would make it so much better.the camera itself is well protected against the elements, is water tight and i already tryied it and it works well even submerged in a pool.overall it was a great buy."
3,"difficult to mount, despite the advertising claims","The video quality and operation are as expected and as described. However, the claim that this is ""easily mounted"" is b.s. the flat-sided helmet mount does not securely fit on any modern bike helmets, as most of them have some sort of uneven ridges. The mounting illustrations in the manual are garbage, too. I am not going to spend money on a new helmet, instead, I have to rig some optional mount with zip ties, duct tape, whathaveyou , which is a major pain. Just be advised folks, if you use this for mountain biking, you WILL have mounting issues. They do not indicate this in their advertisements."
3,Dark video,"I use mine on a bicycle. It is fine and fun except the iris is biased toward dark. Any travel toward the sun, or any direction around noontime, leaves all but the center image in heavy shadow. Otherwise, it is what should be expected for an under $50.00 camera. It suffers wobble, sound control is terrible, and lining up is guess work. None of which stops me from using it."
3,Oregon Scientific ATC 2K,Compact camera that is easy to operate. Controls are on top of the unit with small buttons. Hard to see display makes it difficult to be sure what mode is camera in. A flashlight comes in handy. Provides nice quality video in the correct lighting.
4,review of helmet camera,"I am using this camera on a motorcycle; the clarity is great, I would have liked more video storage but am satified with the product."
2,"Limited Uses, Poor Image Quality","Beware, you're limited to only 2 gig cards, which will probably be enough for most people. Also, the image/sound quality stinks. Objects like trees will be total silhouettes, while tints and tones will usually be overdone. If you're black, or dark skinned, you'll also be a silhouette; if you're white, you're going to be white...literally. There don't seem to be any midrange scales to this camera. Underwater shots can be creative, but, like I said, image is crappy, contrast is crappy and sound is crappy. It's a good toy for kids and a mediocre way to take videos from your bike or helmet. Don't expect much out of it. Look on YouTube for video results."
3,"Handy, But....","The Oregon Video device is a handy tool to have if you ride skateboards, mountain bikes or off-road trail bikes, but there is no place to secure it to a motorcycle helmet. The video is decent and the sound is ok. My ONLY beef is that there is no connector for a motorcycle helmet."
4,the atc2k,Ok the atc2k is like all the other reviews say you get what you pay for. The cam is i think really good but you need to have a good light sorce or you get really crappy video. Anouther thing YOU SHOUD REALLY GET A 2GB SD CARD or else youl have onley 52 sec of vid time on 30fps and the highest cwaluty you can get. The waterprof thing i think is really cool especuley when your aroung girls. jk lol. On a sirus note the clip thats attached to the cam is very sharp so be carfull and its very fragiull. Igot my cam on thursday march 13 and the clip broke 3 days latter. Iwas not happy at all with that i barely droped it on accedent and it just broke off a pice of it. Ok that was dissapointing but the cam makes up for it. Ireally like the cam a lot. I really think this cam was the coolest and best thing i have ever spent money on so i highley recomend it to any really active people who like to viedo stuff in extrem condeshons. I LOVE THIS CAM!
2,"An ""Action Cam""...?????","The resolution of this ""camera"" is so poor as to relagate it to the statis of a kid's toy. Granted, it's cheap, waterproof, and nearly immune to shock. Usable videos? Only a distant ""sort of""....and that's IF you're sufficiently skilled to actually get it pointed at that which you wish to capture. No view finder = take a guess."
3,firefighter,"I am a professional firefighter. I have owned the camera for 5 years. It was originally attached to my helmet, but the connection has broken or melted...again. It has been inside 90-100 good structure fires. The lens is still good, but gets cleaned daily with Q-tips. The rear cap that covers the battery and memory card warped after the first fire.The video is not good quality...""fair"" at best. Audio is ""poor"". The camera offers 3 levels of picture quality, but there is not much difference.Daytime video of extrications and wrecks are OK.The camera is lightweight. I never noticed it on my helmet."
3,Warning...no viewfinder,"I think this little camera could probably be useful for the right person in the right situation. Definetly a steal for the price. However, the picture leads one to believe that there is a viewfinder in one end where the user could review footage. Unfortunately that isn't the case. The small square shown in the picture is the camera lens and the larger end is capped off. Wasn't suitable for our needs, but still a great tool for the price."
4,Good quality for the price,"This is an inexpensive camera that you could use for action sports. I use it on my motorcycle to record and share my rides. I even was able to document a friend's accident (minor) and use it for evidence. But mostly when people realize I have it mounted on my motorcycle, they are reluctant to pick a fight with me or mess with me on the roadways.PROS:* Comes with a lot of ways to attach it to your helmet, handlebar, hand etc* Picture and sound quality is surprisingly good* SD card is easily available and cheap these days* Can be made waterproof by using silicon grease and extra O-ringCONS:* The button controls are small and take a bit of effort and time to work them, especially when in the middle of action.* The helmet strap is not long enough to go around ANY youth/adult size helmet* Only up to 2GB cards can be used* No external display to verify if the picture is correctly framed"
5,Nice for Extremers,"Ive been using this cam for my bike, and I like it.Except the sound quality, but I dont need that sound much!Thank, for good quality."
2,ATC 2K,"The sound on this helmet cam is not very good. The mic. picks up way too much of background noise. A small piece of tape on mic. helps a little, actually definitely worth the under $100 price tag, but would recommend waiting for ATC 3K."
3,Good for the money.,This helmet cam is good for capturing my off road motorcycle rides. For the money it's pretty good but if you are looking for a quality picture and sound keep looking. The camera is pretty tough. I crashed on my dirtbike hard enough to break my collarbone and the camera broke off the helmet mount but still kept on filming. Not bad!
3,Almost unusable battery life....,"Ok, this is a neat gizmo at an affordable price. Mine's been on the motorcycle... and into the ocean.. on different occasions. However, you're lucky to get a whole 45 minutes on a fresh set of batteries. I've tried many times to record my entire ride to work... which is about 35 minutes. Because it's on my helmet, I can't check to see that it's still recording... and I've missed out on some great footage because it's already died 10 minutes after I've left home.Audio.. luckily I wasn't very interested in audio.. because it's virtually nonexistent.Image quality... it's pretty mediocre, but that's to be expected from a product that's a couple years old now. They've come a long way since the release of the 2k."
2,Destroys Your Mini SD Card - Hardware Issues,"The video quality is decent and acceptable for $100 unit. The sound quality is worthless.However this review isn't about video or sound. Not many have posted on the technical aspect of importing video and this is the Camcorder's biggest flaw.As a Macintosh user this camcorder is impossible to use once connected up properly, as it corrupts the Mini SD cards during data transfers.So I tried it on a PC. It worked, but in the end the SD Card ended up getting corrupted. At first it shot my 2 GB card to 1 GB, then proceeded to completely destroy it.I made a decent video with it, but can't keep up with the nasty habit it has of destroying expensive SD Cards. Not worth any price if you can't retrieve the data.**NOTE: I finally discovered after headache it only took FAT 16 cards, and imagine part of my headache was because I used FAT 32 on it. It still has many issues which need to be addressed."
3,"Works great, but hard to adjust horizon","Works just as described, and a great bargain price on Amazon.Would recommend to anyone looking for this product, go for it.Just difficult to use and point ""up"" and often film off-angel... (User error)"
2,Cheap for a reason,"This camera is cheap as far as PoV cameras go but it is for a reason. The video and sound quality are awful. The camera takes forever to adjust to various light conditions and even once adjusted is low quality. The reason that this product was not rated a 1 star was the quality of the build and the physical camera itself.It is tough and very waterproof with better buttons than the goPro and it is easier to tell when it is recording (loud beep). It came with a nice case, and mounts although i did not like the mounts to much. The handlebar mount is the only one that i like because the helmet mounts don't work whatsoever. Overall, i was disappointed with this camera and have just ordered a drift stealth. If you are going to buy a PoV camera, don't buy this one. Buy a goPro, Contour, Drift or even the latest atc9k but Oregon Scientific's first camera was a complete screw up. (written by a skier/mountain biker)"
4,Action cam,"So far it has held up very well, although I had to purchase more equipment in order to use the camera for snowboarding action shots."
5,easy to use fun gadget,"received it on time, easy setup, easy computer plug in, excellent value for the money. My kids love it!"
2,"Perfect idea but poor video quality,","Oregon Scientific ! ! Please, keep working on it. This is a good idea who loves action but it's very poor video quality"
2,video is good.. horrible sound filtering,the worst thing about this camera is simply the audio...it claims to be an action camera... try riding a downhill bike or a motorcycle..all wind noise.. I cant hear a thing other than wind noise.this is even with foam I put inside the audio plate to try to limit the noise[...]
3,"Great video, poor audio, relatively easy to use","I've used this as a helmet cam for kayaking. The mounting was pretty easy. The controls take a little getting used to (to use them blindly-without removing the helmet). The resulting video is very good, good frame rate, good quality, water drips off readily. No problems with waterproofing. The video has a relatively small field of view (Not wide angle), but the frame rate is great. The only downside, so far is the audio is basically useless, very, very muffled. I would also recommend getting the newer version of the camera if you want more that 60 minutes of video, as this cam is limited to a 2gb SD card. But, for the price, this guy is tough, waterproof, and provides great quality video."
3,"simple sport camera fun, but low digital video quality & sound","Camera is easy to mount and use, but quality of video is poor and the sound is bad. Ok to use on home movies for the family. Built tough for the road with mount for motor cycle. Water proof with silicon to use with o rings. Over all its fine for me. Happy and having fun with it."
4,Good value for money,"easy to use, good quality when mounted properly and in well-lit conditions. Sound quality varies with the conditions and can be either tolerable or miserable. This camcorder cannot make miracles - if it vibrates, the picture will be corresponding. You'll be surprised but usual rules for shooting video do apply here, too :). It is waterproof but don't forget to use silicon grease each time you remove the rear lid. One of the drawbacks is lack of the screen - you don't know what you shoot. But, OK, it's a sport camera, not a real movie camcorder. Overall, it's OK and deserves 4 stars out of 5."
1,piece of junk!,The buttons are too small and too hard to push reliably and too close together and the markings are very hard to make out. This 'camcorder' is nothing but a piece of junk. Good thing it only cost me under $50. I put it away in a drawer as a poor example of 21st century technology.
2,Sound Unusable,Sound recorded indoors is unusable. Video quality is OK with decent light. Definitely reminiscent of the 'aliens' helmet cam from James Cameroon's movie. If you are expecting to use the audio you will be severely disappointed. The video has a definite grainy look to it. Could be useful for some shots. Probably worth $49 I don't know about $80!tech observer
1,Won't work with Windows 7,"This product only is compatible with Windows Vista and lower. It's in very fine print lower in the description. Windows 7 has been available for almost four years, which makes me wonder about the company's competence and the viability of this product. I returned it without using it."
3,"Works fair, but took way too long to receive than it should have.",camcorder and memory came separetly and delayed being able to use it. according to the add on amazon I ordered them together but they did not arrive together? I would order directly from mfg next time. Drop shipping sucks!
5,"If You Don't Have One, Get one for Hunt Season!",Length:: 0:59 MinsOregon Scientific AT18-08 ATC 2K Vista Compatible Waterproof Action Cam Flash Memory Video Recorder (Silver)
2,Sensor Dust,"Not happy at all with the product.The camera sensor came from the factory with dust particles, which you can see clearly on the image. There are at least 5 big speckles and there is no way to clean the sensor (other than sending the unit back).Poor quality control is my guess.Otherwise works as advertised."
4,ATC 2K ACTION CAM FLASH,"Haven't used very much yet but see the practicality of it in our travels versus a ""camcorder"" of the ancient variety! Still practicing! Handy though due to size."
2,"Good idea, not a very good product however.","This is a good idea, but the product does not stand up to its appraisals."
5,1st and still one of the best,"Strunz&Farah's 1st recording from 1980 sounds better now than ever before. Although different in many ways (rhythms, still string guitars, compositions style) to their more popular rumba albums of the '90, Mosaico is an outstanding album of true world fusion.

4,Thanks,"Hello ... how are you? Great, me too; and you .. and the family, the children ... All is well thanks. Here is the review: Needs to improve communications; otherwise, good deal, CD in good shape and received promptly. Thanks .. still...!"
3,Teen Titans Go!,"This action figure is a cute and worthwhile buy for any Teen Titans fan, (but as a 16 year old girl who is still buying toys with her allowance money), I will critically admit it is not as high quality as it should be. Beast Boy is my favorite Titan, so I was egar to purchase this figure, and was satisfied with it, but it has a few flaws. His mask and tail are NOT detachable, merely foldable, so it is constantly flopping in his face when children try to play with it. The paint job on his face is also not very high quality, it easily scrathes off by merely moving him around. His face is cute though,(but his tooth sticks out and his eyebrows are too thick) and his costume is quite accurate to the show. Aside from his transformation's lack of removablity Beast Boy is everything you could want in an action figure."
3,A Mango-Shaped Space,The book was good but there there were LOTS of mixupsin the book like lunch bag instead she wrote bag lunch.
5,Amazing book!!!!!,"The book, "" A Mango Shaped Space"" is outstanding!!! One of the best books I've ever read, and I LOVE reading and I like all books.This isn't some kind of cheesy, fake book that's all happy happy. Yes at some points it is very sad but then very happy. It was perfectly written!! I learned so so much about Synesthesia, a case in which your colors or numbers have taste, textures, sounds, or colors. This is a MUST read. It is amazing. Its really sad at some points though.I LOVE LOVE LOOOOOOVVVVVEEEEE it. I've read at least 5 times!"
5,Amazing,I thought this book was amazing. I felt like I was in the book. This book was definitely a page turner
5,A Mango Shaped Space- my review,This book touched my heart and made me feel like I was part of the character's life's. This book definitely deserves five stars. I highly recommend this book and any other Wendy Mass book!
4,An interesting coming-of-age book,"A Mango Shaped Space is an interesting coming-of-age book about a young lady who 'sees' sounds as variations of color (something that actually does happen for a small percentage of people). The insightful book is well written and delves into some things that many teens face (Why am I different? Do I want to be different, or would I rather be like others?) in a very unique way. It also deals with issues of personal loss and grief and online interactions. It is well written, encouraging, and has a somewhat surprising, lighthearted ending."
5,A Mango-Shaped Space,"This book is amazing. Wendy Mass uses wonderful character development, and each of the characters is so interesting. I love how Beth changes her hair color all the time. She is all over the place with her friends that sound like a soap opera. Zack is awesome. He reminds me of my dad, before he died, when he was so full of life. My dad was wicked superstitious as well, but he didn't keep a chart of all the Mickey D's hamburgers he's had. My favorite character is Mia. When I finished the book, I felt like I was a synesthesete because of ALL the imagery and descriptions that make this book wonderful. I love when she's talking about Jenna's name and she describes the color of it with such dimension and depth, that I felt as if I could see it as well.I loved this book -HDF"
4,A Mango Shaped Space,"A Mango Shaped SpaceWendy Mass' A Mango Shaped Space is a heart wrenching tale about a thirteen year old girl named Mia. Mia is like any other middle school girl; she has fights with her friends, and has problems with boys. But Mia's biggest problem is that she has synesthesia. Her parents are wondering why her grades are so low. Mia knows the answer but doesn't tell her parents because she doesn't think they will not believe her. When she finally tells them her mom says ""Are you sure you aren't just going through a phase?"" Mia says ""I'm sure."" They take her to the doctors, and they tell her and her parents that she has synesthesia.This book is heart touching, and is best recommended for middle school girls."
5,Love this book <3,It's a great book and you should read it!!! The story is very touching and funny (at times) I love a Mango Shaped Space!!! <3
5,Wonderful and intresting,I thought this book was amazing and totally deserved a five star rating because of its connection to the reader. Enjoy.
5,Awesome book!!!!!,"This book was AMAZING!!!!!!!! It was heartfelt and sad but made you smile the whole time. I definitely think if you are to read one book this year,it has to be A Mango Shaped space!!!!"
4,This book was awsome!!!!!,"A Mango shaped space is one of the best books i've ever read. A book about thirteen year old Mia winchell with a rare disease called synesthesia causes her to see colors for letters, sounds, and numbers. This book was a quick hooker and immpossible to put down. Though the ending was too quick and abrupt for me. Read it and see for yourself."
3,So-so.,"I understand the need for kids with synesthesia to have a chance to know that they're normal, that's great. Wonderful. And the emphasis on the fact that this is *not* a disease, I love it.But the story is lacking, and I didn't find it nearly as compelling as people seem to think. Really, the whole plot seemed a bit run together, and bland, at best.As a book about synesthesia, it works great. There's a real need for that sort of thing. As an interesting novel? Not so much. That's why I only gave it three stars."
2,"Interesting condition, Dull Book",The bizarre condition Mia has called synesthesia is pretty interesting. She sees colors when she hears sounds and looks at letters and numbers. Once you learn what it is the story itself is kind of boring. The characters are cardboard and the writing style is drab. One blessing is it is rather short. I do not recommend it.
5,Great book!,This book will be a great addition to my reference library. It's in excellent shape and it arrived quickly.
4,Planetary 3,"Solid installment of Ellis' _Planetary_ series. The threads begin to come together even more tightly, but remain loose enough for continued mystery as the series continues."
2,Not bad - read it at the book store,"All in all, a good read. Could have been better, but then again I've never written - drawn - plotted so much as a grocery list, let alone a comic series. SPOILER - The origin of Ms. Wagner."
5,Theres no stopping Vaux,"Vaux is supposedly a ""to see"" band. Pfftt. There more than just a ""to see,"" there a ""must see."" Vaux bridges the gap between rock, emo and grunge all into one nicely wrapped package. They bundle themselves in Nirvanas teen anguish and roll in Iggy pops rock filled blood...Vaux is they epitome of angst in a burning fire of grunge rock n' roll. They place the acid in your stomach and watch you squirm all over the dance floor. For any kid that wants to rock n' roll all-night and party everyday, this is the ultimate CD. However, beware. Vaux is one known to set their own place mat. Or in other words, there work is original and a genre not seen or heard by many. So when you swallow a big gulp make sure you check the after taste, you might like it more than you thought possible...Scarlett Invocation aka Caitlin Burchto talk to the writter of this review aol im: rosepetalcandy"
5,Vaux cd... get it... enjoy it...,"Colorado should be proud. Saw Vaux live with BSF at Irving Plaza. They are really great & definately rock. I guess I can see the Sparta comparisons but they are different. This is much more full bodied music, heavier & for the most part louder (and fresher). The cd captures their sound & may be more finished, but live they have the same sound with much more power & enthusiasm.You should buy the cd.... listen... and catch them live if you can."
2,Vaux.......,I dont know how you people listen to this crap! The only reason i give it two stars is one...they tried to make a cd and two they somehow got signed....dont make the same mistake i made by purchasing this piece o' crap....art core or wutever all it is is out of tune leads and crap guitars with crap screaming..... (o and im 15 im just too lazy to become an amazon member)
2,"MUSIC GREAT, AUDIO POOR","THE BAROQUE RENDITION IS GREAT. IT IS THE QUALITY OF THE CD THAT IS LACKING. THE FIRST TRACK, PACHEBEL'S CANON IN D, IS A POOR QUALITY RECORDING. AT TIMES THE AUDIO IS SO POOR THAT IT IS INAUDIBLE. IF I WANT TO HEAR IT, I MUST TURN IT UP TO 35 THEN DOWN TO 20 DURING THE AUDIBLE PARTS OF THE TRACK."
3,Baroque Adagios,"It's nice to have such an assortment of wonderful music to listen to. However, I found there was a long period of successive pieces that were quite somber. A better mixture would have been nice."
5,winter dreams for christmas,"I loved it cvery much thanks, this is really great i play it a lot every day, esp. at christmas thanks for asking for so much of my time to review something you sold me . I haven't got anything else to do all day long."
5,A Christmas Music Staple at My House,"I bought this CD years ago ... it was my introduction to Carlos Nakai and William Eaton. All the other reviewers have said it already but I will echo that this is hauntingly beautiful ... very simple production with meditative/comtemplative arrangements ... Native American Flute with guitars of all types including Harp Guitars ... Nakai's and Eaton's approach to these Christmas songs is reverent, tasteful and appropriate ..."
2,informative,My daughter has a ONH/SOD. I found this book to be very informative. The only problem that I had with it was the way it made me feel. I know stating the facts is one thing. But it made me feel that the author was a little to cold. I also felt that the author had a JOB to write this book. I did not feel any warmth or compassion at all. It was purely factual.
5,One of the best recordings of Franck's Symphony,"Franck's d-moll symphony is very difficult to perform in good condition. Mengelberg and Furtwangler are superior conductors for this work. However, please listen to Ormandy. His interpretation and his conducting skill are comparable to the two great conductors. It is marvellous. Symphonic Variations is also a perfect performance."
1,don't buy from this seller,I ordered this toy for a Christmas present. The seller sent me a different toy unrelated to my purchase. I tried to contact the seller to no avail. I provided neg. feedback on Amazon and the seller then replied and asked me to remove it and they would refund my money. I have sent approx. 20 e-mails to the seller on how they would be refunding my money and still no reply and no chargeback on my account. I am out $ and have a toy that I do not want. I like to type so until I see my money refunded I will continue to warn other buyers so they don't have to go through what I have.
5,Wonderful Copland recording,"Great stuff, and it couldn't be better performed by Copland at the piano and Bernstein at the podium. Have played some of it, and am dying to play the rest."
5,GREAT GIFT IDEA!,"This great book includes a super charm braclet with charms and a guide to the meaning of each charm.Also the guide includes what a wish is, where to make a wish, and much much more! This is a great gift idea for girls ages 7-14! I hope this was helpful in your decision!"
4,nice colors,these are wonderful for our humidity in maui and the colors are wonderful. they don't come with a holder though.
4,Great Toy,"My husband got this Pooh bear for my daughter on her 1st birthday and she loves it. Six months later, she still sleeps with it every night and has to bring it with her when she wakes up in the morning. It's a wonderful stuffed animal for a toddler!"
3,Soft 'n Silly Pooh,This Pooh Bear is very cute. It seems to be durable (so far!). The only thing I really don't like is the shirt - it is not attached and won't stay on. But other than that he is definitely soft and silly!
4,BEAUTIFUL,"I LIKE THE MYSTERY IT ENVOKES IN LISTENING TO IT, IT IS VERY SOOTHING AND I GUESS YOU COULD SAY QUITES THE SOUL"
3,"Not exactly red, more brown color","After spending hours trying to find a red 36"" tree ring,We thought we'd found one. The price was a little steep,but we needed one of the red 36"" tree rings for our bigger Blue Spuce tree that would match the smaller red tree rings which we purchased eariler at a local store.We were disappoinged that the color was more brown and notthe red color that we expected it to be."
5,Frank at his best!,"This is an excellent live Zappa album. The upbeat version of ""Let's make the water turn black"" is absolutely great. This is one of my favorite FZ albums. Bravo Frank!! Five stars!!"
4,Instrumentally Focused,"Zappa playing jazzy numbers makes for a fine disc. I hate to say it, but his lyrics haven't aged well. So this offering with a large and strong band and a sprinkling of vocals make for enjoyable listening."
5,Meets description,"I was concerned that I may need a larger view head. This head works for me with my ""reader"" glasses. The button to turn on the light source is unusual- press and turn. Be sure to turn it off before storing as it is easy to leave on running down the battery."
3,Nice enough toy,"My 11.5 month old daughter LOVES the little orange frying pan, and she likes opening the refrigerator to find what I have put inside. Other than that, she doesn't much play with it, except to knock it over (which happens quite easily)."
3,I hope my daughter likes it more when she is older!,"I bought this for my daughter shortly after she turned a year old..At first she would sit for long periods of time putting the shapes in the holes, pushing the button, and doing it all over again. She opened the fridge occasionally, but is not interested at all in the noises the pots and pans make on the burners etc..It might just be my daugher, but it does not seem to hold her attention at all. I show it to her now and she walks away. I hope when she is older and has use of an imagination, that she can pretent to cook, etc..Wish I could have bought the shape thing by itself, since that is all she seems interested in. I would save my money for a bigger, more functional play kitchen when your children are starting to ""role play"" etc."
4,It Needs an Anchor Point,"I purchased this for my 10-month old son. He loves to open and close the refrigerator door and push the button for the ice maker. He hasn't quite gotten the concept of the pot and pan yet. The oven door on the unit we purchased is hard to open, but he still enjoys trying. I do agree with others that it is very light-weight. (My son tips it over and lays on the back.) I wish there were some anchor points in back so it could be attached to a wall or sturdy piece of furniture. It is an extremely durable toy and I have already purchased another similar one for his birthday."
3,Not a good value,"My daughter (11 months) enjoyed putting the 3 shapes into the ice maker and pushing the button for a couple of months after I purchased the Discover Sounds Kitchen, but doesn't play with the kitchen anymore. The Kitchen tips over very easily so it is not a good choice for a baby learing to pull up. My sons loved the larger kitchen when they were 2 and up, and I regret not waiting until my daughter was older to invest in a large, sturdy kitchen. If you do purchase this item I suggest you buy some accesories."
1,good for the youngest,"I bought this for my 1 year old after hemming and hawing about buying a larger play kitchen. This is really just too small for all but the youngest. My daughter played with it for a month, but now she wants to play with the cooking utensils and pots and pan, and there just isn't enough room to ""play"" with the kitchen. The shape sorter is nice, but there are better ones out there. My daughter, at the time was all about standing, and when she stood at this kitchen, she was taller than the small thing. This is a great kitchen for a very short time frame for the youngest. I would reccommend buying a bigger one, even if you wait a little."
3,Fun for a young toddler,"We bought this kitchen for our daughter when she was 9 months old. She enjoyed it UNTIL she began walking. Now that she is walking, she does not have the patience to sit on the floor and play with it. We tried placing the kitchen on top of a table so that it would be eye level with her, but found the kitchen is not sturdy enough to stay put. She now prefers playing with her 6 year-old sister's (Little Tikes) Victorian kitchen."
2,Very cheaply made toy,"A friend of mine purchased this for my daughter's first birthday. She enjoys putting the shapes in the refrigerator door and making them drop down into the pot below. I felt that this toy was of very poor quality though, the microwave and oven door are very difficult for her to open/close and are made of very cheap plastic. When I think of Little Tykes I think of quality and this is one toy that is lacking that!"
3,Good for crawlers... not as much for walking babies,"Got this kitchen for my daughter's first birthday. My sister has a different kitchen, and my daughter loves to play with it. The Little Tikes kitchen was not such a big hit because she can't play with it standing up. We've tried to prop it up on a stool so it's at her eye level, but it inevitably falls off (or is pushed off). This toy is more appropriate for crawling babies than walkers for that reason. We haven't gotten a whole lot of use out of it. Also - the pots and pans do not consistently make noise - a little irritating. Other than that it's a cute enough toy."
4,the flaws bug me,"my son got this as a gift at 12 months, loved it for awhile, and still enjoys having it around at 21 months. unfortunately, several flaws have always bugged me enough that i wouldn't purchase this model for anyone else. i'd say that anything beneficial/educational/fun about this toy could better be found in a more well-thought-out product.1) the shape sorter/ice cube dispenser is a cute idea, but the 3 shapes are sized to fit in any sorter hole! good grief, why have a sorter if there is no learning about shapes going on?2) the phone will not stay in its mount & always pops off3) sink is too small to really 'pretend' with4) it easily tips over no matter how small the child, so it has to be placed against a firm surface."
5,Best Kitchen for smaller kids,"We purchased this kitchen for our 1 year old daughter for her birthday. We have a bigger kitchen but she is too short to play with it. We thought this would be a great idea for her. As we expected, this is one of her favorites. She plays with this kitchen daily. She loves to open and close the microwave and stove. It also has a little telephone on the side so she can make her calls. My 3 year old son has also claimed it as his own. He plays with this kitchen more than the big one. They both love it and I do too!!"
4,New version to be released in August,FYI- this kitchen has been redesigned by little tikes and the new version will be released in August according to their website.
2,Not what I expected,"My aunt bought this for my daughter last Christmas. She was a year old at the time and did not play with it at all. I figured she would play with it as she got a little older but she is almost 2 now and it is in brand new condition still. She does like putting the shapes in the shape sorter and hitting the button to make them spill out, but besides that she doesn't play with it. I agree if it were a little taller than maybe she would be intersted a little more. She is very small but still has to bend down to use it. Also it tips over very easily!! I am going to spend a little more this Christmas and get the full sized one. Hopefully she will play with that one!! :)"
4,Already bored with it,I bought this toy for my daughter for her 1 year old birthday she played with it a lot at first but now it sits in her room collecting dust. The only downfall I seen was the little things you put in the door for the icemaker she would put them in her mouth and I was afraid that she would swallow it and now I don't even know where they are.
4,Cute toy..,This kitchen is very cute. It does tip over easily. This was a gift from Santa for my 10 month old but even my 4 year old is playing with it. My biggest complaint so far is the phone will not stay in the holder. I know that little hands need to be able to get it out of the holder easily but it should stay in the holder when placed there and it just won't. It will stay for maybe 5 seconds and that is it. My daughters enjoy playing with the kitchen and that is all that matters.
4,Discovery Sounds Kitchen,"I read quite a few of the reviews for this toy at this site and, as a result, I had some reservations about purchasing this toy for my 1 year old daughter. Since we already had a large kitchen (from her older sister), I decided to go ahead and try this, anyway, for the interim. And I am very glad that I did. My daughter has really enjoyed playing with it... she adores making the ""ice"" come out of the ""ice machine"". She also loves to open the microwave and oven doors to put things in. I am very happy that we decided to give this a try. My daughter is only 13 months and I have a feeling that this toy will be played with for quite some time to come. The comments about it tipping over are valid, but we have it up against a sturdy surface, which is where we would have kept it anyway. In addition, I do agree that the phone is quite frustrating, in that it barely stays in its holder. My daughter, however, is not bothered by this one bit! All in all, I do highly recommend this toy."
4,fun toy,We got this for my daughters 1st birthday. She loved it. Her favorite thing was putting the blocks in and pressing the button. The thing that I did not like was that the phone would not stay on the side and the stove door was hard to open and shut.It actually is not even straight one side if the door is wider than the other. I guess that is why it is so hard to open and close.
4,Mother of 2 year old girl,"We purchased this toy when our daughter was one and she pittled with it some. Now that she is starting to get an imagination,now 2,she plays with it about everyday and tells me she is going to cook supper like Mommy. The burner makes sizzle and boiling sound when they put a bowl on it and they can put the three blocks into the shapes on the refrigerator. She loves the play phone that hooks onto the side.I plan on hanging onto this toy for awhile. I believe the more imagination she gets, the more fun this toy will become for her. I recommended this toy for my niece, who is 10 months. I think it is great."
4,My daughter cooks up a storm with this kitchen,"My 11mo daughter received this for Christmas. When I took it out of the box I thought it was a bit small but my daughter loves it. She spends quite long periods of time putting the shapes in the holes and pressing the button to make them come out into the bowl. She opens and closes the fridge, microwave and oven taking things in and out. It keeps her little hands busy. As she is not yet standing it is the perfect toy for her. Yes, it does tip over but just put it against a wall or couch or table. The phone does pop off at the slightest touch but it's easy for baby to get at. The sink is a little small, but then who wants to spend all day washing dishes!! LOL!My only complaint is that the sounds (a timer bell, sizzling and boiling) are too quiet - I wish it was louder to really get the full effect of cooking."
2,Mommy plays with it more than babies do,"My twin daughters received this as a Christmas present whent they were 11 months old. The first day they woke up and found this toy set up in the living room, their eyes lit up. The girls really like the shape sorter and laugh every time pushing the ice maker button makes the ""ice cubes"" fall out. Each of the ice cubes fits in any of the three holes, so there is less frustration for the babies, who are more interested in pressing the button anyway. Mommy likes to put pretend food and bowls in the microwave, oven and refrigerator and to ""cook"" on the stove and wash food in the sink. Unfortunately, the twins prefer to play by taking everything out and then turn their attention elsewhere.Best feature is the red phone, which the twins fight over. The worst is that this toy tips over pretty easily. As the girls are now walking, this kitchen is getting to be a little too small. We're going to have to get a larger one soon."
4,A great toy!,"I purchased this kitchen for my 15 month old daughter for Christmas. She loves it! So does my 4 1/2 yr old little boy. They have been playing with it non stop since Christmas morning. She cooks us meals and has us try them out. It does fall over quite easily if you have it standing out on the open floor. We solved this problem by putting it against the wall. No more falling over. Easily solved.I recommend this toy for anyone that has a toddler that loves to ""pretend"" cook."
4,A great mini kitchen,This is a great smaller version of the bigger kitchens out there. I do think that they are a little wrong on the age ranges however. My daughter played with this when she was only 6 months old and was soon bored with it by the time she reached 1 and a half. Now we are getting her a bigger kitchen because when she did play with this one she kept herself busy for a while. She's always getting into my kitchen so hopefully the bigger one will keep her busier now that she'll be 2 in february. As far as duribility of the product it deserves 10 stars...My nephews have used this thing for just about anything you could possibly imagine and its been through a lot but everything still works!
4,Fun but tips very easily,Got this for my niece and she loves it but she is able to tip it over and sometimes this leads to her ending up on the floor. We love that it is small and quite portable but a little weight in the base would be helpful.
2,This kitchen has a lot of problems,"I bought this for my son for his 1st birthday. I was espeically interested in the shape sorter for him. It's not much use given that all the shapes fit easily through the round hole - not very educational. The phone absolutely will not stay on the side of the kitchen, it never has. I find that overall it is too small as well. My son always has to sit at it when he'd rather be standing and playing. My son does play with it sometimes but I think it could be very much improved."
4,FUN for smaller tots,"My daughter received this for her first birthday and really took to it. It has been great for her to learn to push the buttons and hear the sounds it can make. She loves opening and closing the refrig door and making the ice cubes fall out. The only downside to this toy is it is small. GREAT for those that are sitting up and/or almost walking (or newly walking). But now that my daughter is walking she isn't as interested in it. It does fall over pretty easily. This is a pros/cons review (in my opinion) for the toy. $30 isn't a bad price for a ""noise"" maker toy. She got several months of fun play usage out of it and learned about cause and effect. Would I buy it again? Sure, but probably for a 6-9 month old versus a 12 month old."
4,Overall Satisfied,My daughter just received this as a gift for her first birthday. She really enjoys the ice maker. I don't like the fact that the ice cubes fit in any of the opennings either. She is a petite child and it is just the right size. Overall we are satisfied with the toy.
3,The good the bad and the teeny tiny,"First, the good. I bought this toy for my daughter's 1st birthday. Her grandma bought her the Nesting Pots and Pans. She really enjoyed putting the pots and pans in the microwave and over. She also liked using the shape sorter on the fridge and pushing the button to release the shapes. Now the bad. It is a TEENY TINY kitchen. Do not expect your child to grow with this toy. In fact, I had put mine into storage when my daughter was 15 mo old. She still plays with the pots and pans. But this kitchen is not for playing pretend. The features are too small to cook or wash dishes. If your child tries to stand next to it he or she will tower over it. It is great for an infant who can sit up on her own, but not for a child who wants to have make-believe play."
1,more dangerous than fun,"I bought the Little Tikes discovery sound kitchen for my 9 month old granddaughter. She liked the different shapes and putting them in the right holes in the frig and pushing the green button to retrieve them. BUT, she pinched her cute little fingers several times in the top of the frig door. Secondly, the kitchen is easily pulled over and in opening the frig door she repeatedly pulled the kitchen over on top of her. Needless to say, I returned the toy the next day."
3,"Great Fun for Little Ones, but Topples Easily","Good Points:For the past few months, the kitchen has been able to entertain our 11 month old son.It's his favorite toy to play with for 15-20 minutes at a time in the morning before he heads off to daycare.The refrigerator door is designed with a lot of space behind it so little fingers can't get caught when it is opened all the way.It has enough extra pieces to amuse our child, but not too many that it is difficult to find them when cleaning the play area.It is not too big to use in a small apartment with limited play space.Bad Points:The shape sorter feature does not work. All of the shapes fit into all of the holes.When our son tried to use the kitchen for stability when he was learning to walk, it toppled many times.When he used it as support when standing up from the floor, it fell on him. (He did not get hurt during these falls since the ""kitchen"" is light.Overall, it's worth the money as a ""first"" kitchen."
2,Not what I expected,"Although I thought it was really cute, it tips over WAY too easy. Thankfully it is not heavy! My older children (6 & 9) have played with it far more than my 2 year old."
4,best for the under 1 year age group,"I bought this for my twins when they were about 18 months old. They didin't play much with it but instead used it like a ladder. I was a bit apprehensive to bring it back out for my 3rd child and he was amazed by it. From about age 6 months he would sit by it and play. He liked to open and close the door, and put the (ice cubes) away so he could push the button and make them fall. He has just turned a year and is starting to loose interest. It is a very duralbe toy. Even with the older two using it as a ladder again, it still looks like new."
4,not worth it!,"My husband and I purchased this toy for our daughters first birthday. I have read all of the reviews and was surprised to see that there was only one complaint of a childs finger getting caught in the microwave door. My daughter got her finger stuck the very first time she played with the toy, a week ago, and has had her finger stuck about 5 times since. I think this toys is very fun but is it worth my daughter hurting herself? I DON'T THINK SO!! I am going to return it and get one she can grow with."
5,Hours of enjoyment!,"My 17 month old got this for Christmas (she was 13 months then) and she absolutely loves it! At first, I didn't really think there was that much to it, but she arranges all of the pots and pans and loves to open all of the doors. She also figured out how to push the button to make the pans sizzle and boil, so she loves doing that. I also bought some extra ""food"" items for it, so she puts all of those in the pans too. She plays with this every day. I am a huge fan of Little Tykes things and they last forever. This is definitely worth your [money]and I think girls or boys will have fun playing with it!"
1,hands get stuck,i bought this product for my daughters first birthday she loved it but she keep getting her hands caught in the slots for the blocks i finally called little tikes the holes should be made bigger so it doesnt happen.
5,THE Klaeber,"A professor in a course on Beowulf once said that Klaeber didn't study Beowulf, he WAS Beowulf. If you want a fascinating and tragic scholar's biography, read up on this man, he was the one and only expert, with a classical background, carrying pretty much all meaning of this very complex text into present times. He give you a great text to work with, a ton of introductory material, language notes, and EVERY WORD in the glossary!!! Write into Jack's edition, but keep this as a cherished treasure of scholarly wisdom and the example of how to write scholarly literature. If you want to be known for having anything on your shelves, then put this baby on there...if you can find it."
2,A CLASSIC DESTROYED,"Just have to toss in my 2 pennies. This was one of my favorite records growing up-- I loved it. I was happy to learn it was coming out on CD, but the horrible, warbling, operatic vocals are terrible. ... Ruined...ruined. Give it two stars only because of the memories of its former glory..."
3,Why did he ruin it?,"I loved the vinyl version of Sleep Dirt. I bought the CD version hoping for a cleaned up version. Unfortunately, Frank decided to add vocals to some of the tracks. A big mistake in my opinion. This would have been a five star CD if it had stayed instrumental. Still, the last track, The Sea is The Ultimate Solution, is simply fantastic. Great playing by everyone. We all know of Zappa's guitar playing ability, but the bass playing on this track (Patrick O'Hearn I believe) is beautiful. Time is Money, was a great track as an instrumental, but with the vocals added on, it just doesn't cut it.If you can find the vinyl copy, I'd recommend buying it. If not, there is still some very strong material here. I just wish Zappa hadn't of screwed around with some of his CD releases."
1,Just so you know....,".. this is a CDR with crappy graphics and a disc that may or may not work on your stereo equipment.I am very disappointed, especially when I was assured by Amazon this was NOT going to be a CDR."
3,"brilliant instrumentals, horrible vocal tracks","""Filthy habits"", ""Sleep dirt"", and ""the ocean is the ultimate solution"" are some of the best Zappa tracks around. The electric upright bass solo on ""ocean"" is particularly noteworthy as is the transcendantly beautiful ""sleep dirt""-my candidate for best Zappa guitar piece. (another reviewer thought this piece was called ""Flambay"" but I'm pretty sure that's the name of one of the awful tracks). Why oh why did the great man then go and make such horrible noises with that singer, uggh! Thana Harris is quite a capable vocalist and might sound good in another context but I can only imagine that Zappa's intention on the vocally oriented tracks was to make something deliberately awful sounding."
3,Ruined by the vocals,"My favorite Zappa LP, ruined by stupid lyrics and out-of-place singing. It is nice to hear the instrumental cuts in digital CD splendor. PLEASE somebody re-issue this CD sans vocals like the LP!!!"
4,Sleep Dirt is one of Zappa's most musically refined records,The single most remarkable cut on Sleep Dirt is Flambay. A piece for two guitars in the key of F. I think that this is a testament to a great guitar player and composer. The acoustic quality is rare for Frank and the emotion even more rare.Who knows how long it would have gone on if his guitar accompanist's finger didn't get stuck. Flambay makes the whole record worth twice the price of admission. Long live Frank Zappa!!!
3,Several gems and some garbage,"The Ocean is the Ultimate Solution is a beautiful and lengthy piece that seems from about halfway through to be on the verge of ending, but instead keeps breaking through to increased levels of intensity. Quite a ride. If you're looking to replace your old LP with this CD version, beware: several songs have an added female voice track that detract from the original."
2,Aaaaaaaarrrrrggggghhhhhh!!!!!!!,"Ms. Roe seems to like switching from character to character, setting to setting...so that a smooth, enjoyable read is impossible. This book was so slow to start, and so darned broken up, that I quit after 20 pages. And guess what...the main character is BORING!!!!!!!"
3,"Good, but check out Hip Hop Hoodios or Blood of Abraham for real Jewish hip-hop","Don't get me wrong, I dig these cats from Chutzpah and what they're doing. There are definitely some pretty funny rhymes here, and ""Chanukah Is Da Bomb"" is catchy.But unfortunately, Chutzpah also follows the lengthy trail of Jewish hip-hop parody (see 2 Live Jews, M.O.T., 50 Shekel, etc). If you want to hear real Jewish hip-hop that isn't so much parody, but creative and offering a real cultural twist to the hip-hop genre, check out Latino-Jewish crew Hip Hop Hoodios new album ""Agua Pa' La Gente"" or Eazy-E protegees Blood of Abraham, whose album 'Eye Dollar Tree' was recently re-issued."
1,TO HELL AND BEYOND,"to be honest this cd is a disgrace to the jewish religion. I'm embarassed to be a jew after listening to this garbage. Who do these guys think they are, representing other jews in this dispicable manner?P.S. besides the music happens to stink compared to real rappers-as a matter of fact not even compared."
4,You want to know the full history of the 356? Here it is!,The book covers the full development of the Porsche 356. It starts suitably with the chapter that's called 'birth of a legend' and in this chapter it is described in a vivid manner how the 356 came to be. All the chapters are accompanied by beautiful pictures (although in black and white). The full development of the 356 gets all the attention it needs in the following chapters. In the middle of the book there are some nice colour pictures and this part is suitably called 'colour gallery'. Even for the general car lover (not specific Porsche 356) this is a nice book to read.
4,Black Uhuru/ Iron Storm,"Awesome album! First got this album in 91 after watching them live at Reggae Sunsplash. Let someone borrow CD and never came back. I've been looking for this album to replace lost one and almost 20 years later I find it on Amazon.com! Original trio (Duckie Simpson, Garth Dennis,and Don Carlos) after ""Now and Now Dub"" ,which is also an awesome album, came out. Highlight tracks are Bloodshed, Colourblind Love Affair, Breakout, Trouble and a classic rastaman anthem Statement. Also featuring Ice T on the positive track Tip Of The Iceberg which I saw a video on MTV after the L.A. Riots. Overall a really good, under rated album. Black Uhuru is one of the greatest reggae groups that withstood the test of time."
3,Auto Aim,"I downloaded the Iron Storm Demo. Good game, but had a hard time setting up the red dot on the enemy to shoot. I would line up the sight, but would be overrun by the enemy no matter how fastI was. Is there a patch to correct this problem?"
5,HELP YOURSELF!,"This is a fabulous book that is very easy to read!! I love the idea of managing my weight and wealth within one book - two very important needs in my life. This book breaks down, step by step how to ""help yourself"". Make up your mind and DO IT!"
5,Very Informative!,"This book is very detail oriented and offers a lot of full color photos, excellent for the history buff or scale model creator."
2,Few examples; monotonous writing,"This books is hard to read because of the extensive and monotonous writing in addition to lacking variety of examples.I took a semester of Hydrology Design, taught by Dr. Mc Cuen himself, in which he had to complement the lectures with numerous handouts with graphs, formulas, examples, and procedures that are not available in this textbook.You would be better off checking your University's Library database for other authors rather than purchasing this textbook."
5,Great Price,A much needed book at a great price. In great condition at a fraction of the original price. Would certainly buy from them again.
1,bad price,This was a total rip off. I returned this item. It is much cheaper in the local store. The sauce itself is great.
1,Spirit Horses (Concerto for Native Amer. Flute & Chamber),This is not traditional native american music to say the least. My thinking reading the discription and one review was that the orchestra background would be of beautiful strings and flowing melody following the flute but to the contrary. It ends up sounding like one these coffee shop futuristic mind tripped messes someone thought might be hip but hey I'm only 1/4 Cherokee what do I know.
3,Uneven,"William Eaton is a southwestern guitarist and luthier who has done a lot of collaborative work with the Native American flutist R. Carlos Nakai (including the excellent CD ""Carry the Gift,"" which I highly recommend). On this solo effort he's joined by Nakai and a few other musicians -- percussion, European flute, violin. Unfortunately, it doesn't have the atmospheric quality of his collaborations with Nakai; a lot of the time, it sounds like rather aimless acoustic noodling. His unusual instruments add an interesting dimension -- various lute and harp guitars, and the astounding ""ole'e'n strings"" -- but it really isn't enough. There are a few high spots, especially the track ""In the Queen's Garden,"" which is a really beautiful little gem of a piece. Mostly though, I could only recommend it if you were totally crazy about ""Carry the Gift"" and ""Ancestral Voices."" If you haven't heard Eaton's work, try those first."
3,Relaxing CD,"Tracks We Leave is a very relaxing CD. I listen to it before bedtime, using it to unwind."
5,An Excellent Book For All States; A Practical Method To Win,"I'm very impressed with Mr. Wolk's writing. The book is packed full of useful information. I've already found three ways I could have gotten out of two past tickets! But he also tells it like it is. He's sarcastic and humorous, so it's a good read. But he's also honest. There are so many things the government has to do to convict you of a traffic ticket. Mr. Wolk explains these things and how to find out about and use them to get your ticket thrown out. What's more, he writes about his sincere concern for people's rights on the roads, how local governments often disregard them, and how to fight for them to protect them for ourselves and our children. Thanks Mr. Wolk, and thanks for the special sections applicable to juveniles too!Sincerely"
5,My Ticket Is Gone With the Birds!,"Speeding ticket...GONE...Officer didn't check the ""unreasonable for conditions"" box on the ticket...Agreed I was driving reasonably...What a book! Funny, informative, intriguing...Buy it and keep it in your car to show to an officer in case you get pulled over!"
1,Not what I was hoping for. At all.,"Ack! I can't believe I paid money for this! Sadly, I was ordering from a computer without sound, because if I could have previewed I would not have purchased. It's like bad 70s AM ""pop"" music. Debbie Friedman is so popular, I thought, and I've heard and enjoyed covers of her songs, but gosh the real thing was almost painful to hear. This is her ""best of"" anthology?? She doesn't have a great voice, and the arrangements range from boring to grating to ""what were they thinking??"" I bought this to listen to in the car, but I have deleted Songs of the Spirit after 3 honest attempts to listen. Sorry Debbie, but as far as uplifting, sing-along-with-it Jewish music goes, these songs don't hold a candle to, say, Craig Taubman's ""Friday Night Live"" or Simply Tsfat's ""Fresh Air.""I am disappointed."
4,A unique style of writing.,"Although I usually get caught up in the relationships between the characters, the descriptions of the surroundings, and the story, (I really like the historical value), I find with Amanda Cokrell's writing a very unique style. I feel like I have just spent the day with an old grandmother telling me some of the old stories. Just the way they were told back then. I'm not always sure whether I am reading a story or poetry.I really enjoy the different perspective of the Coyote who creates his own story inside the story. How very imaginative!It definitely warrants a read just to experience this unique journey. In all the books I've read nothing has come close to her style of writing."
4,The One that Started a Unique Musical Relationship,"Nakai and Eaton have provided much musical enjoyment for me through the years but this is the title that started it all. While I tend to more frequently listen to their later efforts together where they branch out and explore more musical territory and influences, Carry the Gift will always hold a special place. It is a good starting point if you are new to either artist. Then you will certainly want to move on to works like Feather, Stone and Light where the magic of Eaton's stringed instruments and the reflective/spiritual tones of Nakai's flute find perhaps their pinnacle of creative chemistry.- Scriptor"
5,Carlos Nakai is great,"Carry the Gift by Carlos Nakai is wonderful. This is truly music of and for the heart. If you don't know what that means try this: If you are stressed, feel grief, loss or negative emotion, then listen, open your heart and the music will speak to you and heal you. Believe me I know. This is music unlike flute and drum traditional music, it goes not so much beyond it but beside it into its own parallel world and what a fantastic world it is."
2,Not very warm.,"The picture does not look like the product unfortunately. The faux fur trim is skippy, not full as you see in this picture. The material is thin and this does not look good on -- does not look like the model."
1,A Student Reader,"This text is much too complex for even an advanced undergraduate student. I found the chapters to be poorly organized, repetitious and over emphatical on small points, and vague on many important points. For a reader who has a good deal of previous exposure to behavior psychology, this may be a good text. For the majority of readers using this as a text to obtain an undergraduate degree without an emphisis on behavior, it is not. It seems to require quite a bit of previous exposure to behaviorist theories that most readers I have encountered do not have."
1,"Overly technical for the undergraduate, needs simplified.","I found this book to be too technical and dry for the average undergraduate. It contained information that seemed both relevent and useless to the consumer. For instance, the chapters explained a mild version of the topic of discussion, then, went into detail on that topic later on. Instead of breaking the topics up so much it would be preferrable to read it all at once. I read the book numerous times, and still had some problems comprehending the exact meanings of many of the subjects. Learning and Behavior was more technical than the average undergraduate can learn, or should be tested on."
3,too academic,"This is an academic study, presented in a scholarly manner. While it is very good, it will only hold the interest of those who want to read scholarly jargon."
5,The difference of incomes opportunities and outcomes.,It is purely astounding to read how socioeconomic differences shape the lives of children growing up in America. It is also astonishing to read how differently parents from different socioeconomic backgrounds communicated with their children.
5,It Starts Off Slow,"The beginning of this book would discourage you from continuing to read. But once you get into the ""meat"" of the book, you will find some interesting information. I would caution you to examine closely the notion that we are in a hopeless situation when it comes to some children from low SES (There is hope). This book has increased by determination to find ways to assistance families in becoming aware of what they can do to increase the chances of their children being able effectively navigate the educational (and other systems) to insure equity and access."
4,Slight but Sharp and Witty Look at the World,"This is a short book of recollections, memories, and ruminations on the past, present, and future, presented with understated charm and intelligence. Mr. V is surely one of America's finest men of letters, and it is a time to rejoice when he sets down to write how he came to be, how he sees America now, and how he despairs for our future. Funny and insightful, this little book is a delight.I only wish he would turn his attentions to writing a sustained, lengthy autobiography, along the lines of Gore Vidal's staggering Papimplest. Until then we have this to enjoy."
2,Vonnegut falters,"This book is a bit of a disappointment. I had anticipated a greater effort on the author's part. He seems to be camping through much of it, and I had the impression it was published only because he needed a little cash flow."
2,One Man's OPINIONS!,"Vonnegut""s ""A Man Without a Country"" makes a good point that we now have a government that operates by guessing, that doesn't like knowledge or science. However, his entire book (including this very point) is similarly based on guessing and a total lack of data and facts. We've entered a new world in which you're supposed to throw your education away - both the left and the right operate largely on guessing.I agree with some of Vonnegut's major points - the U.S. is hated for its arrogance, we should have a national healthcare system, and the planet is being seriously damaged by squandering of fossil fuels. However, his sarcasm without supporting background material wears quickly wears thin."
2,"The new Vonnegut, same as the old","Vonnegut is one of my favorite authors, and when I saw a new book came out, I of course bought it immediately. While most of his other books are certainly, and in many cases obviously, influenced by his anti-war and socialistic opinions, they are usually wrapped up in a fictional story. This book is rather simply a review of his opinions, taken to the much more bitter level of old age:""There is no reason to ever go to war.""""Everything we do is harming the environment and it will be gone very soon.""""Gas and uranium and the free market should be outlawed because they're making us all poor and dead.""Thrown in for good measure is prose advertisement for his screen prints and possible next novel (working title:) _If God Were Alive Today_, which I would certainly buy, because it's Vonnegut, and his fiction, which I find much more enjoyable than his collections of essays that retread the same ground."
1,A pathetic embarassment,"As a long-time fan of Vonnegut's writing, I was deeply disappointed and embarassed for Vonnegut. Imagine your grandfather getting drunk at your wedding and then trying to give a toast featuring a dirty joke. Vonnegut is just is no longer funny. Sadly, he has lost his wit and the genius of his early novels."
5,Wonderful in all ways,I've started re-reading all of the Kurt Vonnegut books I had in my house. I found six! Then I spotted this new one.This last book is one of his best. I love the way he puts the strangest things together and makes them humorous. The poem at the end says it all.
3,Not Vonnegut's Best,"This is the first time I can remember being disappointed by Kurt Vonnegut. A Man without a Country isn't bad, it's just not particularly good. It's far too self indulgent for my liking. A little of the old Vonnegut shines through in places, but not enough to make up for the flat spots."
3,Less a parting shot than an afternoon chat,"Vonnegut breezes through turn-of-the-century American life in aphoristic, often curmudgeonly free-association. While the inkwell of cantankerous wit hasn't run dry, this book is a bit of an exercise in redundancy; the contained thoughts and criticisms are better developed in his later works, particularly Hocus Pocus and the admittedly self-indulgent Timequake.It is admittedly a treat that Vonnegut gave us one last opportunity to enjoy his pithy prose and withering assessments of modern life in such a loose, intimate collection of essays. Unfortunately, he also ran through these observations and bon mots rather too faithfully in his last lecture tour, which was a disappointment (particularly given how off-the-cuff his prose feels here). While the warmth of his sarcasm is always enduring, it's likewise depressing that Kurt couldn't finish his career with a work less firmly entrenched in the inflexible Vonnegut idiom of smirking punchlines."
5,Irrepressible Vonnegut!,"Wildly, irreverently anti-establishment (when it matters) Vonnegut is a delight to read for his humor and esquisite penetration of hallowed balloons, and he gives cause to reflect on the American social and political scene like few others have. It is hard to imagine that the author was in his 80s when it wrote Man without a Country, so fresh is his insight."
5,Man Without A Country,"As an avid reader and long-time fan of Kurt Vonnegut Jr., I must say Man Without A Country is his best, hands down and bar none. Vonnegut takes no prisoners with this volume, yet isn't offensive. Of course, there are those narrowminded enough to find his statements about how America is being ran now offensive, but they'll be in the minority. Vonnegut is dead on and deserves more than five stars, but that's as many as we can give here. As is typical with Vonnegut, much of this narrow volume is autobiographical, which helps introduce him to new readers. However, his sardonic wit comes through and is sharper than ever. The only thing I can say negatively about this book is that it's too short. My first reading took a scant hour-and-a-half. It is that fast a read, and I laughed almost continuously through it. I am now on my second read of it in less than a week. It is that good.For Bush fans, too bad, but for the rest of us, it's fantastic."
4,Vonnegut's Blog,"There is nothing wrong with reading Vonnegut's blog. You get what you expect -- a collection of great insights mixed in with some family history and wry witticisms. You can read the whole book in one easy sitting, however, there will be parts that may make you pause for a moment or so to let it sink in. The thing that most surprised me about the reviews of this book is that not everyone in the world has read even the basic Vonnegut. I still love Cat's Cradle, and reread it regularly. All in all, it's great to hear from this American master of prose again."
1,"Good book, horrible reading","The text of ""A Man without a Country"" is vintage Vonnegut, exactly what you expect and beautiful. The audio reading, though, is worse than terrible. This narrator takes an elementary-school approach to sentences that injects ""feeling"" into every sentence and phrase without regard for the actual feeling conveyed by the words. For two whole disks you have to endure inappropriate stresses and sophomorically exaggerated tonalities and sneery enunciations he mistakes for the sound of sarcasm, most of which have nothing to do with the sense of the sentences or the prose rhythms that drive them; it is a 3-hour demonstration of a nearly total lack of understanding of how Vonnegut's kind of humor works."
3,Not bad,"I didn't find it as wonderful as the other reviewers, but it's an easy read and passes the time. Vonnegut makes some interesting points and rambles a bit, and it's well-written of course and very Vonnegut. If you like him, you'll like this."
3,Readable,Mr Vonnegut has had better books. He is still the master of political sarcasm and I think his book is worth reading. I read it in one sitting and had a few chuckels.All in all it is typical Vonnegut.
4,Dark Vision Without The Humor,"I'll confess to being a huge Kurt Vonnegut fan. And this is a must read if you love Vonnegut. But it is often not a fun read. Imagine the dark vision of Vonnegut without the offsetting humor. He even alludes to this in one of his entries. Still, there are some very interesting tidbits. But if you are already depressed, you may wish to wait before reading this."
3,World Going to Hell,Read Vonnegut's other work. He is no different than so many other people that get old and have seen enough with this biography. One long gripe is what the reader is in for.
3,Don't expect a novel here... but very Vonnegut,"Kurt Vonnegut is one of my favorite writers. This is not my favorite of his works, but it is unmistakably Vonnegut.As many readers point out, this is not a novel. It is a collection of essays/articles that feels more like a series of casual chats with an eccentric old man. That's not a knock... the chats are funny, humorous, and sometimes insightful.Vonnegut is clearly way over on the left poilitically. He is unapologetic, and there is really no reason for him to be otherwise. After all these years, he remembers not to take himself seriously (some reviewers here could use a good dose of this perspective) and he comes across (to me) as a genuine voice of good will, if a bit sad.If you love Vonnegut for his literature, don't go rushing out to get this one. If you enjoy his voice and humor, it's worth the (notably brief) read."
4,What a pleasant surprise!,"Well, this was a pleasant surprise. I picked it up on vacation on a whim - because Vonnegut was on my list of writers to try one day.This is an enjoyable collection of essays/memoirs about Vonnegut and his views on life. I was surprised at how readable he is. Even when I didn't agree with him, I couldn't help enjoying myself anyway. A few times I laughed out loud at a surprising anecdote. I also learned a few things. (Never knew what a Luddite was before now, I'm embarrassed to admit...)Recommended for those who enjoy essays and memoirs."
1,Meaningless jibberish,"This quote came to mind as I was reading this book: ""What you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.""-Principal, Billy Madison"
2,"Quick, nice read for fans - send novices elsewhere","Full disclosure: I am a big Vonnegut fan. Breakfast of Champions is possibly my favorite book (top 5, definitely), so I naturally had to grab what is probably going to be his last book.First reaction: Meh. It was a breezy, generally enjoyable read, but Vonnegut doesn't really hit up any new topics. Lots of contemplating the fact that he wrote Slaughterhouse-Five, lots of jabs at the Bush administration, lots of talk about how we are dependant on oil.It's just an unfocused pile of scribblings - not that that's necessarily a bad thing. Vonnegut fans will enjoy the quick read, but just send novices to his classics. I recommend Player Piano, Cat's Cradle, Slaughterhouse-Five, Welcome to the Monkey House, and of course, Breakfast of Champions."
1,A Man Without A Mind!,Come on! Why to read this torturing book when you have a wonderful live to life. Don't waste your valuable money and time for this.
5,fall in love with vonnegut,"i promise - anyone with a heart that bleeds for humanity - will fall deeply, deeply in love with vonnegut if they read this book.vonnegut provides his commentary on all things current regarding issues of global justice. his humor makes the heartache a little more bearable."
5,Long live Kurt Vonnegut!,A sage and wizened commentator about our shared dreams and gruff blemishes.
2,Disappointed,"I LOVE Kurt Vonnegut. I have read every book multiple times, and listened to audio versions of all I could find. I have seen Slaughterhouse-Five about seventeen times.However, perhaps he shouldn't have read his own prose. He was entitled to do anything he wanted to at this stage of his career, but I don't have to listen. His voice drove me nuts, and I'm usually a fan of authors reading their own work.Too bad.A Man Without a Country"
3,No alarms,"I have read most of Mr. Vonnegut's books, and have loved them all in different ways, for my money, Vonnegut is the best.I saw him on the Daily Show a week or two ago, he's old, and will be 'going to heaven' soon, so it goes.He had about a year ago decided not to write anymore and not do any talk shows or lectures. He is old.What I can't figure, is why he would come out of his respectable retirement to publish this book, good as it is, since He wrote it, all but two chapters of this book will be things everyone will recognize from previous books and introductions.It's sad, I cried, because he'll 'be up in heaven soon'A reiteration of pure Vonnegut, but no surprises."
3,A disappointment,"I've been a Vonnegut fan, so I approached this book expecting that he would speak to me. He did, in many ways -- his perspective is that of a sadder, older, disillusioned liberal, who has lost the possibility of hope. This is a Grand Old Man of liberal literature, speaking from his 9th decade. Yes, he's cynical -- but Vonnegut always was. I gave this book only three stars because, in my 60s and watching my grandchildren grow up, I need more for my money. I need encouragement to go on, and if you do too, you're not going to find it here (despite V's quirky stories about how he has fun by going out and engaging life). On the plus side, Vonnegut lays his politics on the line and, whether you agree with him or not, you've got to respect him for staying the course and from the vantage point of his 80's, speaking his mind."
2,A Letdown I'd Read Again,"The title is great. Vonnegut sold us with a great title that referred to a statement he'd made about poor (economically) men who'd come home from Vietnam finding themselves as men without a country. Watch the movie, ""Back to School,"" and Sam Kinison shows a little bit of this while teaching a history class.Vonnegut put what he states is the funniest joke in the world, which I have used to open talks I've given. The results have been mixed; the more educated the crowd the more receptive they are.Sadly, this very fast read is a composition of some of his already stated ideas. Frankly, I was hoping it would be a novel, as one review had said, about a man on vacation whose country is either spit out or swallowed up while he is away. The title with the content, however, leads us to believe that Vonnegut is merely stating how he feels as an American, or the work of impressive marketing, which I can certainly appreciate."
1,UGH!! Worst EQ series EVER,"I read this story in its original color comic book form (EQ New Blood issues 15-35). It is reprinted in black and white in the Reader's Collection volumes ""Forevergreen,"" ""Dream's End"" and ""Phoenix.""What a complete waste of time. It is truly awful, and I don't know how or why the Pinis saw fit to let Barry Blair (the artist and main writer of this series) ever do anything with Elfquest or approved these for print. The artwork was really bad, the story was blah, and the characterizations were horrible. STAY AWAY!And please, don't pay the $50-$150 current asking price for this out-of-print volume. Trust me, it's not worth it."
1,The bottom of Zappa's catalogue,"There are seemingly abot 70 Zappa album's around, nearly all of them worthier of his name than this uninspired collection.For the uninitiated, try one of his Rock-Oriented sets, such as You Are What You Is or Joe's Garage.Earlier album's are more accessible too-Overnight Sensation or One size Fit's all. If you enjoy red hot music try Hot Rats,give this one a miss unless you are someone who has to have everything Zappa ever did. Tepid and deadly dull!"
5,World War I U-boat skippers tell their stories,"Lowell Thomas, in 1928, did the remarkable. He scoured Germany to interview its top, surviving U-boat commanders from World War I. This book is their story in their own words, as told to Thomas.It's a remarkable collection of sea tales from a time of both extraordinary bravery and chivalry. Yes, chivalry. Contrary to the poplular tales, the U-boat commanders did not machine gun life boats. More often than not, they showed a degree of kindness and humaneness to their enemy that is long since forgotten in warfare.Of particular interest are the long distance forays by the U-boats into U.S. waters near the end of the war. This is a part of the war that gets very little attention. But these guys really took it to the enemy homeland in a way that got huge results for the small number of ships that actually made the trip across the Atlantic.A first rate work in every way. A glimpse into a past that will never again exist. Could not put it down."
1,"This May Be Art, But It's Bad Art","This movie is just bad. Rarely have I watched a movie and just wanted it to be over. I can appreciate its artistic merit, but this movie had no point. Why somebody actually bankrolled this movie, I'll never know. There was plenty of sex, but the most boring sex scenes imaginable. Maybe it's just not my cup of tea, but I would only recommend this if you want to see just how bad and a waste of time a movie can be."
5,Astonishing entry into cinema future,"Look at Crash as a beautiful film but also as a set of instructions: cinema could go here, Crash is an opening, a blueprint, a direction for the future to take. Are you coming along for the ride?"
3,A Movie that has attitude,Wow this is one nasty movie! Well if you're in to the weird erotic kind of movie you will definately want to pick this one up. Definately not for the squeamish. Of course you should expect that with an NC-17 rating. a fair addition to the genre.
3,Fetishistic movie that promises more than it really gives!,"The idea was admirable and quite original by itself. In the middle of the troubled and most terrible solitude, a frustrated woman finds a morbid pleasure around the horrid spectacle of death and desolation immersed in automobile crashes. Pitifully the script simply can not surmount the anecdote character, to remain in this uneven drama; the story lacks of ambition and it navigates between the sordidness and the conceptual ambivalence without major pretensions.The film is inscribed among the delirious universe of let 's say a master in these affairs: David Lynch, who possibly would have achieved major results. The alluring presence of Holy Hunter and the talented actor James Spader simply can not win with such primary plot."
1,If I could give it fewer stars I would,"After reading some of these reviews, I wonder if people have seen the same film I did. I was not shocked, grossed out, or offended by this movie...I was terribly bored. The actors were trying way too hard to look sexy and mysterious. There was nothing believable or interesting at all about this film. So you want to crash cars and have sex...who cares? If you want to see a disturbing movie, see Betty Blue. If you want sex, rent a porno."
3,STRANGE MOVIE,"Let's see - we'll this movie is very weird, sick and twisted.The story and plot was bizarre and i wouldnt recomend this film to you cause it wasnt that good.The only thing good about this movie that saved it was the actors. James Spader and Holly Hunter were good. James Spader was especially convincing in his character.Like it says on the front cover- all it is is (( sex and car crashes).oh yea and also the ( eroticism of cars) whatever that is suppoused to mean. Everyone who has seen this movie that i know or whom i have shown it to and watched it with was like ( this is the freakiest movie)- not cause its especially disturbing but because the concept is so strange and out there. Though i have to warn you there are some disturbing parts. I give it 3 stars for the concept even though i dont like it certainly was brave of them to make a movie about somthin so crazy as this and the acting was ok but i would not recomend this. It's more like 2 and half stars-3."
4,Wait & then wait some more,"Cronenberg let it slip a few times that he has recorded a commentary for Criterion, yes Criterion. A guesstimation of landing in print sometime late this year, should be adequate. If your hungry for some Creative Cronenberg, buy/watch the Videodrome & Naked Lunch DVD's."
4,By the way,"Just wanted to let you know, my original review was edited. Don't hold this one against me. Also, I agree, if you get the chance, by all means see Dead Ringers and Videodrome. It's weird but cool stuff. You can expect that from Cronenberg."
3,sex and crashes as a metaphor?,"David Cronenberg has made much better films than this one, Scanners, Naked Lunch, and Dead Ringers being fine examples. Perhaps the symbolism/metaphor went over my head, but if their even was a valid intellectual point the abundance of sex probably overwhelmed it. The film is interesting only for it's visual qualities. The gray,black, and dark blue color scheme. Also the car crashes themselves are thrilling. Other than this however the film is a waste of rare talent:Arquette, Cronenberg, Hunter, etc......"
3,car mold,"Although a febrile adolescence hovers bleakly near to Cronenberg's intellectual strivings, his amoral visions (here asexual and attached to heated metal), often intense, often dull, go by like the blue whine of traffic."
2,Not Impressed,This movie was about sex and car crashes. The crashes weren't elaborate and the sex WAS NOT GRAPHIC. I do not understand why it received and NC-17 rating and why it was considered to controversial. I only gave it 2 stars because of the hot sceen between the two men.
1,"Art...with a capital ""F""","I am not going to write a review here that contains patter about this film being artistic in this modern time that we live in. I am going to be as plain and truthful as I can be. I am not ignorant and know a thing or two about art as I studied it for many years, however I can safely say that I have never seen as much (...) as this in my entire life. This film is so bad I never finished watching it to the end. Save yourself the time and money and watch The Dead Zone again instead."
5,always excellent,I am always pleased with the efficiency of Amazon to deliver a product in a timely manner. Have never had a complaint.
2,Not what I expected.,"When I went and saw this movie with my friends we all expected an erotic thriller that barely made it into theatres. What we got was a movie that disgusted us and made us walk out of the movie before it was over.I found it's plot very poor, and some of the sex scenes completely pointless. In my eyes it was on of the worst movies I have ever seen.What got us to get up and leave the theatre was the scene in which they were making ""love"" in the Mercedes ............. I was disgusted, revolted, and very disapointed with Cronenberg for putting this drivel on to the big screen.If you like to see sex, now I mean A LOT of sex that is completely meaningless (yes I know that they get off by having sex in car wrecks), then go RENT this movie. However if you are like me and enjoy a somewhat intellectual movie, then borrow this one folks"
2,Very Slow,"Some think this movie is great, others think it's sick. Personally I think it was just a boring movie. The premise sounds fascinating, fetishising car crashes, but the execution is poor. Slow and boring is the only thing that I can say about it. I like Cronenberg a lot, but this was definitely one of his subpar efforts."
1,A Crashing Bore,"I failed to get anything out of this one note symphony. Utterly unengaging, this movie threw mass automotive violence, injury, and sex at me, but managed to say nothing to me. I would rather stick pins in my eyes than sit through it again."
1,Horse [poo],"Horrible movie!! After worshipping James Spader from films like: Less than Zero, The Secretary, Sex, Lies, & Videotape and even the TV show ""The Practice""--what is there to say? Complete disappointment, horrible script, horrible acting, horrible film altogether. Had no direction and no substance. Do not buy this, if you a bit curious like i was then rent it..."
3,Sick? Twisted? Perverse?,"I have to admit, I'm no fan of Cronenberg, and this movie hasn't improved my opinion of him. I think if you are a fan of his work, this movie may well be right up your street. For me it was a strange movie, some people have commented that it was too slow, and I was itching to press the fast forward button but resisted to give the movie a chance. It is bizarre, sick, twisted and quite the most perverse 'mainstream' movie I have seen. I can't say that there was a great deal more plot than an above average porn movie, lots of seemingly gratuitous shots of female anatomy both scarred and unscarred. Mediocre sound I thought, good picture quality, an interesting curiosity. I don't believe anyone should expect to be 'entertained' by this movie. I won't be keeping this movie."
2,.,"It *isn't* a very good movie, no argument there. A few interesting ideas stewed together with some pretty explicit and sometimes weird sex, pretty much sums it up. Not much else is here: story, believable, developed characters, a sensible premise, etc. But it's interesting as a curiousity... something to see if you think it sounds at all interesting. And hey-ho, that James Spader is still rockin' strong!"
2,Crash Landing,"In Crash, director David Cronenberg's idea of foreplay includes vicious car wrecks a la Jayne Mansfield. If this kind of highway carnage doesn't get your motor revving, don't worry: there are plenty of others in the cerebral filmmaker's latest descent into the maelstrom.There's something undeniably alluring about the automobile: the chrome, the sheen, the rich Corinthian leather. All Crash is missing is Ricardo Montalban. Actually, there's something a wee bit Freudian in the movie's come-on; but for all of its psychobabble and metaphor, its still about a bunch of sexed-up blank slates doing the nasty in the front seat, the back seat; in a car wash, in a parking garage; guy on girl, guy on guy, girl on girl.It's hard to like Crash. More dry dissertation than moving movie experience, it makes you numb. Maybe that's the point."
1,Pitiful; a major turn-off. What was Holly Hunter thinking?,One of the worst movies I've ever seen. No redeeming qualities whatsoever. What was Holly Hunter thinking? Trust me; leave this one behind. It's a pitiful excuse for a movie.
1,"""The Sickest of the Sickest""","After seeing this film, I realized just how normal I really am. The film is a insult to all those involved in the making of it."
1,David Cronenberg marries James Spader,"David Cronenherg. A name synopsis with creepy, scary and very unusual films. This movie is no exception. CRASH is disturbing. A surreal experience of sexual overdrive involving cars, crashes and extreme sex. David is quite a director. However, would you feel the same way about David's past films if his name were really Sally Cronenberg? I think not. Gives you something to ponder on though, doesn't it."
2,auto erotica,I can only wonder how many folks out there do get off on auto wrecks and the resulting injuries. The movie itself is outlandish and somewhat annoying with the whispering/mumbling dialouge.The movie lost credibility when we see Vaughn taking photo's at a fresh crash scence without any obstruction whatsoever. No way this would be allowed to happen.Very surprised to see Holly Hunter play such a role. Sader and Unger pull it off very well.
2,Aptly Named!,"The only exciting thing about this movie is the gratuitous nudity and the idea behind it. ""Crash"" is an overrated would-be drama showcasing unexplained, ridiculous depravity. Giant p(l)otholes and a weak script make for a bomb even James Spader and a couple of pairs of nice breasts couldn't save. ""Crash"" is aptly named. The only reason I watched the whole thing through is because, like a car crash, I just couldn't take my eyes away."
3,sex and car crashes... thats it.,"Theres not too much to say about this film except that there is very little to this film. Theres some wierdos, some sex and some car crashes and thats about it. The rest is just filler. Had this had actual porno it would have made more sense because it seems the story is just setting up the sex scenes in this movie. The sex is hot and it carries this film but thats really all it had going for it. 3 stars, one for each hot actress that shows her boobs."
2,Weird.,"This is one of the strangest movies you will ever see. There are some interesting parts, and I certainly wouldn't say it's not worth seeing once. I would, however, caution people who don't have the stomach for this sort of thing to stay away. Holly Hunter is good in her supporting role"
5,"Cronenberg's ""Crash"" is a masterpiece",This movie takes you into the pysche of exotica in a S&M scenerio. You have people who survive car crashes and are turned on by the experience. The movie takes the turn of the crash victims getting into self inflicted crashes to gain arousal. These crashes are a vessel to gain sexual energy which into turns the crash site into a sex zone. This is the kind of movie that would will blow your mind. David Cronenberg gives a great sense of putting you there.
2,It just goes nowhere,"I admit the concept of David Cronenberg's Crash aroused my curiosity after reading the discription among various websites. I don't know how well this story was thought out on in the namesake novel but it certaintly isn't in this film. I could not care less about any of these characters and why they could be fascinated by car crashes. There is always a rational explanation behind what turns people on and this film has NO idea how to provide it. So instead we get sex scene after sex scene not knowing who these two perverse abstracts of humanity are; I describe James Spader's and Holly Hunter's characters as such because they are so lifeless and glossy eyed I can't accept them as human beings. Simply put, this is just a totally un-involving and dull film. Cronenberg is usually a very talented directing when dragging us to sexual or violent torrents, he missed the marked in this unfortunate dreck."
4,"stimulating, both intellecual and primal","This movie is either a love it or hate it kind of thing. I thought it was interesting, but the acting and the plot a bit ackward. If strange things excite you, you can easily be pulled into this movie. It keeps me guessing at the how and why certian things can become arousing, and just what the message of JG Ballard's writing really was."
4,Ride on the Wild Side,"This film is not for everyone, but it is an excellent adaptation of the controversial novel and is one of Cronenberg's best! If you are a fan of Cronenberg's work as I am, this is a must have. Spader and Hunter fans beware ---- this film is a real departure for both. The actors in this film, like its director, have guts to have tackled this one."
1,Absolutely One of The Most Disturbing Movies EVER!,"First, I love James Spader and Holly Hunter as actors; but this is one of the most mentally disturbing movies I've EVER watched. Moreover, WHAT would posses ANYONE to want to make such a movie? There are absolutely NO social or other redeeming qualities about it! Period. End of Dicsussion!"
2,A Sick & Perverted Fetish!,"When David Cronenberg first bursted on the scene with one of his first horror films, ""Rabid"" in 1977; he featured porn star Marilyn Chambers in the lead role. Fast forward 20 years later and he seems to have come full circle with this bizzare release. A couple who become involved with a group who stages famous crashes and become sexually aroused by the sheer thrill of it all. The characters have a serious fetish problem. At the end, I'm wondering ""...why should I care about these people?"" The film is sick & perverted and not a pleasant film to watch. Leave the kiddies at home! Don't get this film confused with the 2005 Oscar winning drama! It certainly doesn't deserve any awards! Bypass this one!"
1,"Utterly and stupid, repeling, and disgusting!!!!!!!!!!!!!","This is resoundingly far and away the worst film I have seen from David Cronenberg, not that any of his films were classics ( except for THE FLY). but I mean who would fall for a sappy idea like this, people sexually aroused by automobile accidents. Isn't it time for Cronenberg to do something valuable in his life, pursue another topic rather than blending sex, technology, and mortification of the flesh. Ted Turner wanted to shelf it because he hated it but his company FINE LINE has distributed it throughout Europe. I could have given this film a 0.5 rating just for the title (""CRASH AND ROT IN PEICES"" would have a nice string to it), but since my scale couldn't support that, I will round it off to 1."
5,Why does anyone listen to Maltin anyway?,"Thus film may not appeal to someone's taste, but there can be no question it was brilliantly crafted. But all Maltin can do is squirm in his seat. Where does he get the right to pontificate about films, and why is his nonsense printed here? He actually appeared in ""Gremlins 2"", you know."
1,It doesn't get much worse then this...,"LAIN is one of the worst series ever done in anime. It doesn't make any sense, it piles on some useless religious symbolism (any anime grasping for meaning does this) and uses awfully dated fears of the internet to create any kind of mystery.The biggest insult is that this series goes on TOO LONG. If a show wants to be confusing, it shouldn't be long winded as well. The art is pretty awful, and animates slightly more then Clutch Cargo. I am surprised the LAIN crew didn't do the chroma-key mouths to save on animation costs ...Yuck."
2,UGNHH,"I never watched it all the way through. But what I saw of it wasn't that intresting. The first time my friend put in the dvd I fell asleep then, the next time he put it in it was quickly turned off and replaced by another anime. There should be a warning on the package that says ""If your intent is to stay awake, do anything but drewl, and/or be boored DO NOT WATCH."""
1,The Worst show ever created!,"This show doesn't deserve to exist! This show is dark, depressing, and horrific! I love anime, but this is just terrible. The only good things are the beginning theme song and the ending theme song. I will never watch this show again. However, if you like strange depressing stuff, with lots of blood and mind warping junk, this show is for you. in all i must say that this show needs something cute afterward to cheer you up, and that this show makes Evangelion look as happy The Simpsons."
5,Check this one out,"Lain is one of the most carefully built-up story-lines in the genre. The soundtrack and the visual ambiance drive the show. By no means is this an action flick, I would categorize it under ""Horror"", due to the slow exploitation of of tension. Definately in a class of its own."
5,Word of Advice,"Be advised that one standard approach to experiencing culture, ""This MUST make sense"" is counterproductive with ""Lain."" It is best to simply experience it as a sensory trip until the plot occurs to you (in my case, halfway through) if it ever does. The point here, I believe, is that ""Lain"" is ART, with a narrative aspect, rather that a plot that happens to be artistic. Sit, stare at the screen, and be amazed."
4,Okami's Lain Review,"The series is slightly confusing at first but once you get into it, it becomes really good. I really liked this anime. However, it is not for anime fans that are just starting out. Lain is a dramatic anime that consists mostly of unexpected twists, turns, and speed bumps. Everything considered, it is an exelent example of japanese animation."
5,Mind-Boggling Series for the Wired Generation,"Lain is a true masterpiece. Though short, it is an amazing story with eerie visuals and a dark gothic atmosphere. It is the story of a young girl and the evolving technology that causes her to question the difference between man and machine. It can be quite confusing most of the time and only leaves you wanting more. Each time I watch it, I find something new. There is little ation in Lain, so some may be bored. However, if you enjoy creepy and intriguing anime that makes you think, give Lain a try. Japanese trailers and conceptual drawings are also provided on each disc for your enjoyment."
4,The Wired,"This was quite a bizarre little series. This really isn't your typical action-packed anime with a fight scene every 5 minutes, this one has a much slower pace to it, relying more on the dialogue and development of the characters, rather than ""who beat up who"". It goes down to a deeper, much more psychological level. Right to the bone, in fact. This was a very rewarding series for me. While it's not entirely perfect, nor entirely flawed, I think the mood it sets for the viewer is terrific."
3,A series for abstract art lovers,"While Lain is a short series, comparatively, it seems very long thanks to its sluggish plot. If you expect a story to be told to you while watching this, you are only half correct. The author intentionally leaves countless loose ends in the series, which the viewer has to tie up however (s)he see fit. While such extensive use of symbolism allows viewers to personalize the series as much as they like, such freedom of interpretation ultimately rings hollow for the average viewer. The author uses countless references to obscure internet trivia, electronic trivia, computer history, abstract art, and loose symbolism when constructing the plot. Unless you are well versed in these areas or have ample free time to look them up, watching Lain will most likely be irritating. However, people who see religious faces in food and/or appreciate Pablo Picasso's work will likely love this series."
3,Didn't work for me,I'll go 100% with what Simon Leake says in the Editorial Review. That is exactly what it is.Not to my taste tho. I wouldn't say I hated it but I didn't get drawn into it either.
3,if i could i'd give it 3.5 stars,"There's not much I can say about Lain the plot is so thick thers no way to descibe it.I will say the visuals are rather nice,kinda artistic animation with neatly blended ""shady"" colors. I couldn't give it a higher rating becouse the film lacked any kind of action,and thats what i look for in my kinda anime. Be warned if you have trouble or just dont like hard to follow plots involving no action stay away from this one. On the other hand if you like drama's with deep,deep plots check this one out.Just don't get frustrated with it, you wont have it figured out untill the last few episodes thats just the way it was written. Thats if you figure it out at all!"
2,"I Bought it, but I Don't Buy it","The best thing about it is the theme song... It was very very good to start with but the suprise ending that is supposed to tie everything up falls a little short of the mark. It's... unfeasible, for lack of a better word. I just don't buy it. Maybe if it was explained better.Also, the main characters (especially the heroine) were so cold and souless I found I simply couldn't relate to any of them. I'm not saying that it's bad animation, far from it, they did it on purpose as a kind of extremely unpleasant atmosphere. But if you don't relate to the main character, how do you get drawn into the story?"
3,I like Anime but...,"I have no problem with anime but this is one series I never really got into. I bought it because one of my friends recommended it, a piece of advice I never should have taken. I think that this is one series in which you either love it or hate it. Lain wasn't my cup of tea although I know some people who thought it was amazing. This only advice I can give when someone is not sure whether or not to purchase Lain is to tell them that if you like computers and religious symbolism, go for it. If you're like my and you like stuff such as HEllsing or X, then spend your cash on something else."
4,Worth watching.,"Serial Experiments Lain is in a class of its own. My first impression of the series when I watched the first episode was the artistic virtuosity of the drawings. The scenes were drawn well but that was not the main issue. The style which was employed in the renditions gave a certain feeling, that involved the viewer even as the series progressed. My second impression was that the concepts and ideas in the series were quite unique. It wasn't unique in the sense that these concepts are alien in japanese anime and such, but that the way things were played out was interesting. You can recognize art similar to NieA Under 7. I think the same artists did work on Serial Experiments Lain."
2,Lain for Mange addicts,"Lain is very deep even for manga. Unfortunately it's so deep you can fall asleep watching it. If you are expecting a bit of action don't bother. On the good side you can watch it a several times and pick up new things each time, the down side is you probably missed those parts when you fell asleep."
3,Good but over rated.,I watched the whole series in one day and even though it has some great ideas I just couldn't get into the series and at the end I was left wondering what the hell happened and was there any point to anything that came before the final episode and it has some of the most lifeless characters I have ever seen on a TV screen.A lot of people compare this anime to Boogipepop Phantom but personally I would recomend that over this anime every time.Overall good but very over rated.
1,Do not buy this ...........! -Jult Warfell,Between this and Texhnolize I lost over 600 + minutes of my life having to watch this crap. waste of a dub talented actors. Jult Warfell
2,"All interpretation, little actual meaning","Serial Experiments Lain is a Y2K fever-fueled plotless wreck. The benefits are that everyone can look at what's happening however they want- this also means that most likely any messages or plot you manage to descern when it's creators seemed to see fit to flirt breifly with lucidity are your imagination more then anything that was actually planned. If you recently won the lottery and no damage will be done wasting money and time, go for it. Otherwise your life will certainly be complete without Serial Experiments Lain."
2,"Very well made, and yet...","I have a lot of friends who totally love Lain, and I guess I can understand why; it's certainly an expertly crafted and well-directed series. However, there is one thing this series is lacking, and that is character. Nobody in Lain really has much of a personality. Things happen to them, but we very rarely have any idea how they FEEL about it, and frankly that makes for a rather unengaging series. Also, I find myself personally being irritated by shows that don't make sense until people explain them to you. I mean, seriously, what's the point of watching it if you don't even know what the heck is going on, or really care?Lain does, however, get bonus points for suggesting that Hayami Sho is God. Woohoo!"
3,Very Overrated,"This is not quite as great as everyone makes it out to be. The animation is amazing, but the story is very hard to follow, and disjointed. It is also very slow, and easy to fall asleep while you watch. This is a hit or miss in my book"
3,It's like a drunken philosoper,I'm still not sure whether this is an odd show simply for the sake of being odd or whether you can draw meaning from all the nonsense (what mj 12 has to do with the story is still unknown to me). The series can draw you in with the bits of brain candy dropped every now and then and the feeling that all the puzzle pieces will fit together anytime now but after you see how it all ends I doubt if you'll watch again.Lain is like a brilliant drunk blathering on about this and that but never really tieing everything they say into an intelligible thought. Soooo if you're looking for something to read symbolism into go for it but this is hardly the smart show I expected.
5,Se lain,The series was good ! I wish they had more merchandise . Absolutely loved the dvd ! Mist buy !!! Worth every penny !!
5,Serial Experiments Lain,"A great series!Its very simple animated and yet its beautiful to watch, the music is superb from the Magnificent Opening theme Duvet to the far shout ending theme. Very good characterization of the main character and one of the best emotional animes I have ever seenIt has very original storyThis series will confuse you heavely and I had to watch it twice to understand what was going on, this is so much better then the matrix will ever be and is recommended to people who loved Neon Genesis Evangelion series."
2,Weird. An acquired taste for sure.,"Seems like Lain is on every kind of top anime list somewhere so I knew I had to watch it eventually.The artistic direction and overall quality of this series is undeniable, and it definitely kept my attention the entire time because I just wanted to know what the heck was going on! So I definitely was not bored by it, however I cannot say that I personally found it to be very entertaining. While it was thought-provoking, I found myself confused a lot and very uncomfortable the entire time. Really it creeped me out and I consider Lain to be more horror than anything.I didn't find myself liking any of the characters of this show and overall I must say that I will probably never re-watch Lain, although it would probably make more sense if I did. I appreciate the efforts of its creators, and understand the love for it from fans, but its just not my cup of tea. Now to re-watch some Trigun to wash the weirdness off of me."
3,"Solid inspirational tie-in to ""The Prince of Egypt""","""Destiny and Deliverance"" subtitled ""Spiritual insights from the life of Moses"" delivers a solid collection of 8 chapters each by a different author. Philip Yancey and Joni Eareckson Tada lead the way with particularly well written insights. One pleasant surprise was the terrific contribution of John C Maxwell whose great gifts in speaking and leadership have not always translated well to the printed page. His chapter on the 10 gracious gifts God gives leaders is worth the price of the book. Good stuff all around with a couple of ""weak-sister"" chapters that don't add much. ""The Prince of Egypt"" may not have topped the box office but this book helps to broaden the impact of its message."
2,Great Quality & Speed - Poor compatibility & Support,"This printer has superb quality and awesome printing speeds. However, installing this printer was a nightmare: no matter what I did, Setup would never recognize the printer as ""connected"". After rebooting several times & keep trying, it will eventually be recognized & properly installed. But Alas, if you go to bed and next morning try to print, no luck: printer not recognized... Canon Support? Ha! Never replied my e-mails. Phone support? Not a chance, it is an international long distance call from Mexico...In my 10+ years in the IT industry, I had never had so many troubles with a printer, as I have with this Canon."
5,Simply Awesome!!!!!!,No need for a long wordy review. The Printer is simply the best.That's it. Just buy it!!!
2,"Awesome Printer, But Received Two Defective Ones","The first printer I received was defective. I returned it and received another that was defective. I did not return this one to Amazon, but to Canon, and now I have one that works. The printer itself is totally awesome with great features and the quality of the photo is exceptional. I think Amazon just received a bad lot of them, but, to Amazon's credit, the returns were easy and when I let them know they seemed to have a defective lot, they said they took them off the virtual shelf. Great printer, but make sure it's not from the bad lot, that was frustrating and took hours of my time trying to trouble-shoot."
3,Need to Wean Kittens? There's something easier.,"I realize KMR has the nutrients cats may need but my 5 week old kittens would NOT eat it no matter how hard I tried (my older cats do like it though).We were getting down to the wire and our 5 week old kittens had to eat solid food before they were given away. I tried several kittens formulas and KMR- and they wouldn't eat anything, because they preferred nursing. However, when I brought the ""Whiskas Purrfectly Fish, salmon, snapper and shrimp"" out all 8 kittens gathered around the food dish and gobbled it up as if they were starving! I realize kitten food is said to have the nutrients kittens require but there must be something to the Whiskas formula for the kittens to take to it that well. I could give the kittens away to new homes as planned thanks that Whiskas formula."
2,Kittens refused to eat it,"Six different (pretty healthy) kittens that I fostered at different times would not eat this stuff, neither lapping it themselves or being bottle fed. I had to force feed them. :("
4,Essential if you no access to a native speaker,"You need to have the Colloquial Danish book as well. All the dialogues and many of the practice exercises in the book are recorded on the CD, and given that Danish pronunciation is so tricky, you really do need the CD.It is well recorded, at a speed which I found just right: fast enough to be realistic, but not so fast that I couldn't catch it. It makes you listen quite carefully. I found it most useful to go through the exercises in the book first, then after a few days to go through them again on the CD, without the book.There are four native Danish speakers making the recordings, two women and two men. Both the women speak clearly, as does one of the men; the other man mumbles, making him difficult to understand."
3,BUYER BEWARE!!,"This unit doe NOT have video out feature. If you are looking to use this unit as a stand-alone dvd player for the car, this unit will work. However, if you want to hook it up to other screens, this unit will NOT do it. I have been told by Alpine that they have removed this feature because of Copyright laws and they were forced to remove the feature. I was dissapointed because I paid over $500.00 for this DVD player and it doesn't even have a simple feature that a $100 dvd player has. Other than that, the unit is fine."
5,Excellent Auto Overhead DVD playe,"The Alpine PKG-RSE2 DVD is an excellent auto overhead dvd player..The picture is fantastic and screen is very large. The dvd player comes with only one set of wireless headphones so be sure to order a second pair of headphones if necessary.It is a very large overhead system , so be sure to measure before ordering. It just fit into my Jeep Commander with very minimal space left. Although it already has a Fm modulator , I did need to get adapters before the installation, but sound on system is fantastic and works through both the cars speakers and headphones..With the fm modulator , you are able to shut off movies volume from auto speakers and listen to radio while movie is also being viewed..I highly recommend this system especially at Amazons price you can save a ton."
2,alpine dvd,I bought this dvd player 15 months ago and it worked great until today. Now it will not read discs and it is out of warranty and alpine will not repair this item. I paid a premium price for what I thought would be a quality product and planned for it to last the life of the vehicle. So beware of buying this product if you think its quality is superior to the cheaper brands.
4,Nice upgrade for the money,"Installation on our Honda Pilot went well with a little research on wiring/panel removal. The unit continues playback where it left off when the ignition is turned off and back on. The sound is superb as well as the video quality. I recommend soldering all connections, had a solder-less connector fail on my ground wire. I connected the ACC and Battery connections into the main connector behind the radio. They don't provide screws to mount the plate to the ceiling braces, so make sure you get the proper machine screws. I had no problems with the sound through the factory radio or wireless headphones. Volume was very good, so not sure why the previous reviewer had issues. Suggest cutting a small slit in ceiling panel to help find the ceiling brace to mount to. I've done custom car audio installations before, which was helpful."
2,Predictable and tiresome,"Prdictable,tiresome and juvenile prose made me suffer in reading to page 184.The story is ubiquitous in todays popular novels as well as the thinking of the characters.I found nothing original and it seemed as though the author was just puting in the required number of words to collect her fee."
4,Great book to start off the new year!,I found the book to be an easy read which is great for someone like myself who does not have a lot of time to filter through extraneous information. The book is full of thought provoking ideas and questions. Most useful to me are the case studies at the end of the chapters. They provide concrete examples of how the 3C Leadership Model works. The book offers plenty of ideas for improving performance. I found that the chapters are specific making it easy to find information quickly. Hearing about struggles and successes of top managers helped to put things in perspective.
2,Not my favorite,This little statue looks like a generic bearded man in a hood- more like a Star Wars character than St. Francis. Also a strange greenish tinted finish. It didn't work for me and the deer knocked it in the pond. (They didn't like it either.0
3,For Zappa completists only (which isn't a bad thing)...,"This is a decent album, but it's not among my Zappa favorites (no pun intended). All 5 songs/pieces here are on other albums, and those versions are better than they are here. As you Zappa afficiandos know, this was originally part of the 4 LP Lather album, so it wasn't meant to be Frank's first ""official"" orchestral album. Having said that, Strictly Genteel is better on the 200 Motels soundtrack (but the version here is better than the out of tune mishmash on the London Symphony Orchestra album), Naval Aviation in Art? is better on The Perfect Stranger album, I like the longer versions of Bogus Pomp and Pedro's Dowry on the LSO album, and Duke of Prunes sounds better in its rock version on Absolutely Free. It's an interesting album, well arranged and played, but there are much better renditions of these songs. I am a bit of a Zappa completist, so I do have this, but I don't play it very often."
4,underrated masterpiece,"This one doesn't get 5 stars because I happen to prefer his rock bands and arrangements. However, I may grow to appreciate it for what it is: great compositions, very well played and with that magical Zappa touch: perfection with a laugh!"
3,Interesting but not essential.,"For orchestral/instrumental Zappa of this type you'd do better to buy The Grand Wazoo, Waka Jawaka or maybe The Yellow Shark. This album ain't bad but FZ has done better. 'Tis a tad uninspired to these ears."
2,"Peissel -Tibetian authority, terrible writer.","Just about the only redeeming thing about this book is that it deals with Tibet. Peissel is a complete bore through most of the text. He spends way too much time bitching and moaning about how he wished he was a true Victorian explorer and hardly discribes the scenary or the people he encounters. He spends over 200 pages whinning about his lot in life, intertwined with his trip to the head waters of the river, then in only 12 pages he recounts a later trip to Tibet to study native horses. It's sad to say but I much preferred the 12 pages to the 200."
3,"Stimulating,fascinating,frustrating read.",This book is an iconoclastic journey poking fun at what needs poking and challenging the exclusive and sometimes pompous world of fly fishing. Sometimes one will respond with delight and at other times will find the author overly bombastic. The fun of the book is the dialogue the reader ends up having with the writer in the course of agreements and arguments while working through the text. John Waite has done us a service in presenting the results of his survey in a manner which gets one's mind engaged and occasionally gets our goat. The major drawback of the book is that it at times is poorly written with many grammatical errors and poorly constructed sentences.
2,Burning Sky music for native Amer. flute/guitar/percussion,"Can't recommend anybody to spend money for this CD. After reading all the fine reviews and having listened to Burning sky Enter the Earth, I was very disappointed to listen to this album of uninspired ""elevator music"". Rhythms are unnoteworthy, music is fair. It's just not inspired or inspiring. Enjoyed Enter the Earth much more and highly recommend it."
2,Not memorable,I dont even know where this book is. And cant for the life of me explain why I even bought it.
1,This book is not available to everyone.,"I have been searching for this reprint. I came across the notice that said it was available from BHG. I called the 800 phone number and ordered the book. My order was taken along with a credit card number and told that it would be shipped out to me. I waited and waited . Finally one day a post card arrived from BHG. They will not ship to Canada because of the high cost of postage ,etc. This just amazes me, as they can sell their magazines here but will not share their offers. I have ordered and received many other patterns from companies in the United States with no problem. As I am paying the shipping I can't see where their should be any problem. Just passing this along in case their other Canadian stitchers have had this experience."
2,2 Stars because I like Owen Wilson,"Watched this movie the other day, I, like others, thought it would be a good physcological drama. Serial killer, poison etc. etc. Sadly I was wrong. I even fell a sleep in the middle of it and when I woke up it was as if nothing had changed. It plodded along at a snails pace. I was really hoping for more, I like Owen Wilson but this movie didn't do him justice."
5,Der Minus Mann from Germany,This is one of those movies that you think will really be good. The storyline has enough to make you suspend your disbelief.Owen Wilson is so cool.The soundtrack is amazing as well.
3,Serial Killer Drama Lacks Bite,"THE MINUS MAN is a serviceable drama about a serial killer who comes to a small town and starts killing off some of the residents. It plays more like an episode of a TV drama than any kind of serial killer thriller, though. There are no real shocks, scares or anything really compelling about any of it so fans of films like ""Henry"" or ""Silence of the Lambs"" will most likely be disappointed. The performances are all excellent, though, and this helps the film at least retain some sort of interest (but at 114 minutes, even they outstay their welcome). It's a shame it really doesn't even play well as a psychological study of a sick mind. Overall, a watchable movie, but most likely destined to be forgotten in the vast video wasteland."
3,Owen Wilson is all the money!,"The Minus Man is definitely not your typical Owen Wilson movie as it sheds light on a schizophrenic serial killer who travels cross-country poisoning his victims with a rare mushroom that grows in the Northwest.In short, the acting and the dialogues are not that great (the supporting actors disappoint with their performances!), while the plot and the setting, are just average.If it wasn't for Owen Wilson the movie would have been really bad.As for the rating, it could have been PG-13.Overall, far from being a masterpiece, it just might provide for an evening's entertainment if you're big fans of Owen Wilson. 2 Stars"
2,IN SPITE OF EVERYTHING GOOD...,"...this is a disappointing movie. I found myself truly mesmerized by the first half of the movie, trying to figure out what Owen Wilson's character was motivated by; who were these two detectives (Dennis Haysbert, Dwight Yoakum) and why were they haunting him? What really was going on with the landlord's missing daughter? Why did Brian Cox off Mercedes Ruehl? What was the glib ending supposed to mean? Owen Wilson and Janeane Garafolo do fine jobs in their roles; Brian Cox as always is astounding. But why was Vann doing this? The movie answers no questions and ultimately that's why I find it hard to recommend it, in spite of its good points."
3,Not Bad But Not Sure What the Point Was Either,"THE MINUS MAN * * 1/2 Owen Wilson (Twister, The Haunting) is a mild-mannered serial poisoner who settles briefly in a small town and sortof romances postal worker Janine Garafolo. Not sure what the point was but the movie was reasonably interesting and very well acted. Dwight Yoakum plays one of the two imaginary cops who haunts the killer's nightmares."
2,Minus man adds up to less than zero.,"I'm a fan of offbeat, quirky little movies, and what I'd heard about this one made me think it would be right up my alley, but no, it started to turn in to my alley and then stalled. Way too slow, way too deliberately strange; like David Lynch, only not very good. I found the pacing of every scene to be annoying, the non-sequiters overdone, and what the heck is going on with Owen Wilsons'nose anyway? You want a strange little movie nobody ever heard of starring a bland, blonde leading man, and a sort of mathematical title? Try ""The Zero Effect""."
3,not a typical serial killer movie,"For those of you who are expecting a serial killer movie with violent deaths, police investigation and action, this is not what you are looking for.""The minus man"" is surely a serial killer movie, but with a very slow and peculiar rhythm. It is about a kind and gentle guy, Vann Siegert (owen wison), who moves to a small town, gets a job at the post office, and a room at a couple's house. He is the kind of person you can talk to, or even work with, without noticing he is a killer. However, he is not violent and kills using some poison, which he puts in the victim's food or simply offer it as a beverage.This movie is very interesting, because it shows that even the good persons have a dark side hidden somewhere, and in some cases, they cannot control it. Please pay attention to the dialogue scenes between the killer and some imaginary detectives, who keep questioning his crimes.All I can say is that it's a very intriguing film..."
1,disappointment,"When this came out at the movies, I wanted to see it. Never got around to it and forgot about it. Was at the movie rental place and saw it (they only had two copies, which should have told me something). Rented it and could not wait to see it. Horrible, predictable, boring, the whole nine yards. I cannot say one good thing about this movie. HATED IT!"
1,Minus this movie!,"This is the worst damn movie ever. Please don't get it, if you see it in a video store, roll your eyes and keep walking. This film had no point at all. It is not like your typical suspense. Very dry, very flat. I was so bored, but the funny thing is this movie had a chance. This plot and the outline was good. He was a nice, descent looking guy, nobody would have thought he was a serial killer, who poisons his victims. And the end, what the hell? I would love for the writer of this foolishness, to explain to me about this nonsense. I don't mean to be overreacting, but it is that bad. If you saw it you would probably act worst. To me this movie doesn't exist anymore. It was the dumbest, no point at all movie ever."
1,Expected much more,"I wached the movie today and I must say it's one of the most boring movies i've ever seen. I thought that it might get better in the end by solving the main questions - why does he kill and how does he pick the victims. The cover says - ""Psychological thriller"" and I expected a totally different type of movie. I really think it was a wast of time."
1,"Confusing, boring&#65533;a HUGE letdown","There have been many reviews for this movie already. However, if I can make one less person buy this movie, it will all be worth it. This has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen...and I'm a film buff. I own over 75 movies. I've seen many more. But I haven't seen any as bad as this one...except (maybe) for 12 Monkeys. PLEASE do not buy this movie! The end will leave you confused and let down. Also, interestingly enough, I couldn't wait for the movie to be over as I watched it. It was just so BORING (for lack of a better adjective)."
4,Very cute,"Very cute. Felix eats too much chocolate and goes to bed too late and the next day does not feel well. His mother tries several cures, but finally takes him to the doctor. My favorite part is when she bundles him up and takes him outside and puts him on his motorcycle to get some fresh air. But she doesn't hear Felix make any motorcycle noises so she knows something is not right! Wow, does Rosemay Wells know kids, or what? They end up going to Dr. Duck which seems like it might be a little scary... but it isn't.My three-year-old asks me to read this one again and again."
1,"Useless, no effect on fleas","This product has absolutely no effect on fleas. It is, however, the most annoying super fine (so as to be maddingly sticky) powder that feels like it never all comes off your hands. The smell is in no way pleasant either."
4,NaturVet Herbal Flea Powder Review,"This product got my attention because not only is it environmentally safe, but also can be put on the pets along with their bedding. The only down fall of this product was that it is only half full. I am not exactly sure if the product worked. We got a flea problem after getting a new dog so we bombed some rooms and gave them all baths. This didn't seem to work completely so we got some spray and powder. It looks as though it took effect, but we still get the occassional flea. Though our flea problem was horrible so if you only see a few fleas this should do the trick."
3,It's Okay,"I purchaced this text book to use as resourse in my classroom. I bought it as ""like new"" but what I received was a text book with writing all over it. A student who used the text book placed her name in highlighter all over several pages along with inappropriate drawings. It's safe to say that I didn't put it out for my students to use. In fact I couldn't really use it without the other parts of the geography alive program. I wish I never bought it."
4,"Great joke book for children, tedious for adults","When she was younger, by daughter loved joke books like this. I didn't, but in the interests of my giggling daughter, I listened to her read them. The jokes are great for children and eventually excruciating for adults. In this book, drawings accompany the jokes and they depict ugly monsters, the theme of the jokes.Some of the jokes are:*) If you were locked in a cemetery, how would you get out? With a skeleton key.*) Would you like a haircut? No, I'd like them all cut.*) Igor, there's a fly in my alphabet soup! It's probably just learning to read.If you have a child that likes to read and joke, then this is a book you should consider. Parental love has no bounds."
4,Very nice,"Great value for the money. We purchased a Queen Coverlet in Taupe, but as it turned out the true name of the color was Antique Gold. The color is just as pictured. I suppose ""Antique Gold"" is a better description than ""Taupe"".The Coverlet is rather thick, but not too heavy. We need it for decorative purposes, so I wish it was a little thinner. Other than that I'm very happy with it. I've been looking for this type of coverlet for over a year!"
2,Look but don't touch,"I got the coverlet in black and tried to keep my expectations low because the price was so great, but I was still disappointed. The coverlet is very very thin and the velvet side feels horrible and scratchy- it is also very stiff. However, the reverse side of the coverlet is fairly soft, and I'm hoping that after a few more washes the velvet will soften and the stiffness will fade. As far as appearances go, the coverlet is very pretty and looks lush, so if that is more important to you than the item's practicality, then you've found your coverlet."
3,Irregular Decorative Stichwork,"The material for the coverlet is good, and overall I am satisfied with the product.The product, however, does not look as good as in the ads. The decorative stichwork is irregular. For the amount I paid for the Coverlet I was expecting more even decorative stichwork. Nevertheless, now that my expectations have been levelset, I would probably order the product again in a different color. The next time I just will not expect that I am getting so good a deal."
4,Very Nice ... Good Value ... IF YOU GET A GOOD SALE PRICE,"I got the King size in Sage for $39 with free Amazon shipping. For that price it is a great bargain and I would highly recommend this one.However the regular price is totally absurd and there is no way this would ever be worth that kind of price.All in all, a good $39 cover."
1,think before you buy,These are incredibly soft but the stitching is very poor ...looks like it would fall apart on first wshing ...i returned mine for this reason as i have kids and it would not work well for my kind of use....
3,Kundalini rising to a bride like on her wedding night,"As I have said many times before, my gender does not know how to write a decent book. There is only one way to get through this tome, speed read. You'll never miss anything, because all the points are repetitiously, hundertfold recurring. The first half of the book is her grief over a pilot named Mervin who was shot down in WWii. In her exclusively self-centered way, she emphasizes in the middle of the book her Hollywood ambitions, which seem not to be remarkable rather than being a model, she then embarks on visiting mystics, mediums, gurus in California. The grand master who eventually after another half of the book is kind enough to unveil himself goes by the name Kut-hu-mi. Everything in this book shows an outmost self-centered individual named Earlyne Chaney. From the beginning, her sparse observations could have been described in a couple of pages. Except her three Kundalini accounts; and they are dangerous to the human mind!"
1,Gould as a Just So Story,"Instead of investing in this book as a companion to the PBS series, consider investing in other books on evolutionary theory such as Dawkins ""The Selfish Gene"" or even Darwin's classic ""Origin of Species."" While these evolutionists have been misinterpreted for years in North America, Gould's Just So Stories have been running rampant. Instead of looking to the so called evolutionists responding to the PBS series in this book, you would better spend your time looking to those that have spent their lives pursuing this science and have built the credibility to speak clearly on this subject."
1,"""Reading on the tedious side of misery...""","Mr Tate takes great pride in entertaining trail-mates and readers with gross depictions of burps, bodily noises, rude comments and the just plain being-a-jerkness he evidently displayed to many whose paths he crossed while on his thru-hike. Maybe it's just what former Marines do when unleashed back into the wilderness. His completion of thru-hike was admirable, but I felt like I suffered and stumbled through every word of his just as he suffered and stumbled along the AT. I stopped reading the book several times, but like a true positive-thinking and hopeful future thru-hiker, I felt it my duty to see the book through to its end. And to think I wasted almost $27 on it... could have bought a lot of trail mix for that. Read WHITE BLAZE FEVER instead."
1,ICUFFM,"Want a good book about how to hike the AT, then read, ""We're Off To See The Wilderness, The Wonderful Wilderness of Awes"". It's the most entertaining book and most informative on how to hike lightweight. I'm having a hard time with J.R in this current book... annoying!! Alter ego? Good grief!!"
1,Walkin' on the Happy Side of Misery,"I have read a number of books on the Appalachian Trail and enjoyed all of them with the exception of this one. It seems as if the author's primary focus is to exhibit some imagined writing skills. Instead of simply reflecting life on the trail, he attempts to artificially imbellish points to the extent that the book becomes boring - very boring. I was very dissappointed."
4,Another good AT book,"Not having the time or resources to hike it myself, I've read countless of these memoires about hiking the AT. This is an amusing read. Its a long book, and since I've got ADD it says something that I finished it. However, he likes playing with this split-personality joke throughout the book, where he talks to this ""other"" self. That gets old and often confusing. If you can just slide past that it really is a good book."
1,CAN YOU SAY RIPOFF?,"A quick glance through this book at the home and garden store promised many detailed designs. Upon close examination, however, it became clear that this book is nothing more than a glossy come-on, requiring you to sink another fifteen bucks PER DESIGN for a plant list specific to your locale. Don't waste your money on this one."
2,Not OEM quality,The hose is servicable but not nearly the same as the hose from Broan/Nutone. It is made from hard plastic and is similar to a swimming pool vacuum hose. It does work however. (Try to utilize the hose end fittings from your old hose.)
5,Verhohnend droht' ich dem Piraten...,"Perhaps I'm lacking in the sophistication with which this recording's declaimers are over-endowed... I thought Terfel's Wotan was brilliant, my favorite since Hotter, with a freshness of voice that gives me a glimpse of what Hotter must have been and of what Terfel *will* be. I disagree that ""Leb' wohl..."" is overcome by anger at the beginning. I found the emotion throughout wrenching without distracting from the music. I also think Terfel's Dutchman has become more chilling, desolate and powerful since the Levine recording. I hope I'm still around when Bryn tackles Wotan for real, but for now I'm happy to have this much. :)"
4,Great to Have if You Go to Reptile Shows,"If you really like to go to reptile shows to get your pets, this book is really great to carry with you. It consists of numerous one page entries on individual species. It includes nearly all of the reptiles (including snakes) and amphibians that you would encounter in the pet trade. Although I wish it had more information on whether or not a certain animal was easy to handle or good for beginners/experts, etc, it's a good ""shotgun"" herp book to have since it details lots of different species not just a select few. So if you ever have wondered how long a long-tailed lizard gets when you are at your local herp show, you can easily look it up in this book."
3,never received my order,I would like to review this book but it never arrived.Have sent multiple emails to source but no success.
1,"If you home educate, don't bother with this book.","This book is one long commercial for the Logos school that the author runs. He is against home education and lets you know it.I was hoping for something more substantial, something that would give me concrete ideas and examples to help me teach my children. Instead I received an uninteresting sales pitch.Don't waste your money."
5,"An ""education"" about Classical education",Excellent-Insightful and thought-provoking. Makes me proud and excited to have my child enrolled in a classical education school.
3,A Book Begging for a New Edition,"Douglas Wilson's 1991 work, Recovering the Lost Tools of Learning, is an excellent overview of the pitfalls of public education and the promise of classical Christian education. I thought Wilson's points were well-developed and his arguments convincing. The reason I can give this book no more than three stars is because I see it as a book greatly in need of updating. Over the last twenty years, the problems in many public schools seem to have gotten worse, while the homeschool movement has exploded and become much more sophisticated. How would these two developments affect Wilson's conclusions? In addition, an appendix describing the last twenty years at Logos School would be enlightening. How firmly have the principles Wilson espouses in the book been practiced at Logos School over the past two decades? Overall, I appreciate the content of this book but an updated edition could make it even more beneficial."
5,GET IT NOW!!!,"Maybe the best Miles book I've read. It has changed the way I listen to music. I cannot reccomend it highly enough. Get it now. Read it now. Thank, you Paul Tingen, Thank you."
4,Why wasn't this in theatres?,"This movie is one that will make you stop and think...It is one that will make you ask your friends ""what would you do if..."" I thought that the relationships portrayed were done well...The actors couldn't have done better..."
3,"Relax, it's just sex...enjoy this movie!","This is probably not everybody's movie but if you're a little quirky enjoying a slightly different perspective on life, this one's for you. The story follows a small group of friends in their personal stories and how those stories affect their interactions. This group of friends is a mix of gay and straight together folks who find that they are not only friends but indeed family in the course of the movie. I hope I've raised your interest, this one is worth investing the time to see."
1,Terrible,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I had the misfortune of seeing it in a theater with a friend, so it would have been rude to walk out on it. If I'd been watching it at home I would have turned it off in disgust. One review titled it ""Relax...It's Just A Really Awful Movie"" and I've always thought that was perfectly accurate. The movie tries to be deep, but fails miserably, and ends up being trite and absurd instead."
2,who cares?,"This film just seemed to go on and on and on and on...I found the writing to be madulin and amatuerish. I didn't care about these characters at all. Except for a couple of performances, most notably a charming Lori Petty, this movie was a big ""so-what"" yawn.Skip this movie unless you aren't paying a cent for it..."
1,A worthless waste of time and effort,"Some movies are practice for actors to keep working, but this is just a total waste of time and plastic. It would have been better to give it less than one star!"
5,Not what I was expecting,"I bought this DVD based on the reviews I had read on here. I wasn't quite sure what to expect. What I got was a totally interesting, intriguing and though provoking movie that provides laughs and tears. One thing is for sure, if you have a problem with gay people, this isn't the movie for you. This shows (sorta) some of the aspects of gay and lesbian life but ultimately it's about relationships, regardless of gay or straight. I found some of the movie disturbing because things happen that I didn't quite expect but still an awesome movie that says something about life. Don't miss this one."
3,"Relax, It's Just Good!","A group of eccentric friends struggle to find sex, love, and happiness in Los Angeles, with rather unexpected and surprising consequences.Overall I really enjoyed this little indie film although the dvd quality/transfer had a bit to be desired..but that's ok. The cast is likeable and charming although some people may be offended right off the bat in the beginning with some graphic sex talk/scenes but that sets the tone of the film. There is also a suprise twist with some shocking results towards the middle of the film...let's just say its a twist on rape. Anyway-it definitely wont be everyone's ""cup of tea"" but if you're daring and like a good sex ""dramedy"" check it out!"
1,Stale Sounds,"I'm sorry to say that this album was just plain boring. Bought on the pretence of an original and progressive style, this album just did not live up to expectations. There is a strong repetitive sound to all of the songs which drain the positives out of the album. The only highlight for me was the Journey Agent, which is built around sampling with a lively pulse. However, after a good start, the album disappeared into nothing other than shear boredom."
2,Pleasant Background Music,"I found the Pnau album to be good sleeping music. This is largely because what I found in Sambanova didn't amount to much. It failed to deliver stylistically, and fell into a repetitive drown. Thus, I found the music, which was at best average, to provide a pleasant drop for the multitude of afternoon naps that I enjoy."
4,Love It or Hate It,"First of all, I'm not a classical music expert. I can't break down a work and analyze each portion. What I can do is give a view of this recording that I think has been missing. IT IS FUN!My mom and dad had one of the original LP copies of Bernstein's interpretation of Messiah. I remember well listening to it as mom would load up the record changer with Christmas LPs.That said, this version of Messiah has a lot to recommend it. As Bernstein says on the cover, it is arranged logically. Why the original work was arranged in three sections is hard to figure out. I have used this arrangement to ""rearrange"" other versions and it always satisfies when I listen to it.When I think of Messiah, this is the recording that first comes to mind. It may be strange, but it grows on you!"
1,Slow and Heavy,"I want to say that I am a HUGE fan of Lenny B. I have collections of his mahler and beethoven recordings, autobiographies...all the good stuff. I am very sorry to say that this is the only recording of his that I really don't like. It is very heavy and slow.I personally like very clean, more baroque style recordings of the Messiah, which is one of my favorite works. I have performed it multiple times, and at various tempos and styles.I wouldnt recomend this recording, even though Lenny is amazing."
5,Life is a Jungle,"This was a great book. It had me laugh, it had me cry, and it made me want to move to Peru(Not for long!) Ron Snell is a great author. I can` t wait for book three!"
5,Zappa Thrills Listeners!,"This album is hilarious at times with songs like WPLJ, and the instrumental arrangements are testaments to Zappa's skilled, unrestrained manner of musical expression."
4,LEFTOVERS,"Burnt Weenie Sandwich and Weasels Ripped My Flesh are two albums of leftover recordings released shortly after the demise of the original Mothers. There are certainly a few gems on both albums, but as a whole these two albums are below average for the Mothers. Just as you'd expect an album of leftover songs would be."
2,Great album but in mono sound,"This is a great album from Julie Andrews, recorded around the time of CAMELOT. However, this mp3 version is in mono, where the original was in stereo, and is likely taken from an LP. The album was released as a Spanish import from CBS Records Spain - those tracks are in stereo with much better fidelity, worth the search rather than buying these compromised download tracks.Here is a link to the version with better sound (and it includes a second album as well, Julie's 1962 music hall album ""Don't Go In The Lion's Cage Tonight"")Broadway's Fair Julie/Heartrending Ballads & Raucous Ditties"
5,Zappa fancy,"One more times, Zappa is the one. I bought this one in USA because it's the complete record(all songs in it). Fantastic"
4,excellent,"I am not sure if Zappa knew this was his last tour but he was sure acting so. He formed a big band. These musicians were at least as good as the 1973-75 band, but 1980s sampling and digital instruments gave them an edge.He had this band learn almost his entire catolouge. This double set covers the rock material, whileMake a Jazz Noise Hereencompaasses more abstract compositions.Broadway the Hard Waycovers more theatrical material.Tracks ranging from ""Heavy Duty Judy,"" ""Inca Roads"" and ""Who Needs The Peace Corps"" are here, along with an improptu cover of Johnny Cash's ""Ring Of Fire."" The sound of the band with their modern equiptment is so massive, earlier versions sound malnourished. Zappa's guitar work has a density and abstraction that may make this the best axe work of his career.This and the other two CDs will give you over six hours of music from the 1988 tour."
5,Excellent recording of the '88 band,"Returning to a horn arrangement more characteristic of the 70's Mothers, this 2-CD set catalogues some great live performances. The first CD gently prods the absent Johnny Cash, who was originally slated to appear before his wife got sick, in several of the tracks. The performance of the ""One Size Fits All"" suite stands as another testament to the band's technical prowess. The second CD is a little more gimmicky, taking some not-so-subtle swipes at Jimmy Swaggart. It ends on a good note, however, with a nice arrangement of ""Stairway to Heaven""."
3,Eccentrock,"3 1/2About as bizarre a rock concert you will hear, a portion of the double disc does feel forcefully contrived when translating Zappa's excruciatingly technical, sometimes crude humor to the live setting, but fun cover songs, progressive prowess, and blistering guitar soloing makes the short lived '88 twelve piece band most certainly worth hearing."
2,Hodgepodge,"Having seen Zappa in concert (1976 - Homer Hesterly Armory - Tampa, FL) and being a moderate Zappa fan, I have to say I was a tad bit disappointed in this CD. For you rock fans who crave Frank's exciting guitar solo's, this CD falls way short. Yes, there are a few guitar rifs thrown in now and then that showcase FZ's skills, but most of this CD contains orchestra/horn type tinkly diddly's that some of his fans love. For me, I miss the stuff like ""My Guitar Wants To Kill Your Mama!"" ""Ring of Fire"" was very disappointing and basically thrown in unrehearsed. ""Purple Haze"" I give a 1/2 star. What he could have done with this song would set your ears on fire. But alas he didn't. You have to love ""everything"" FZ did to appreciate this CD. For me it just wasn't it."
2,Not for everyone,"I first heard FZ in 1976 in Tampa, Fl. I just loved his magical guitar work. I dont' think there's anyone better. I gave this CD a 2 because there's so much of that missing. For those uninitiated, this double CD album is mostly horns, slow moving lyrics, odd tunes, and not the stunning rock songs and guitar solo's he's partly famous for. I was looking forward to ""Ring of Fire"", ""Bolero"", and Hendrix's ""Purple Haze"". But alas, none of them featured FZ's guitar work, just endless monolog and instrumental oddities. Even Zepplin's ""Stairway to Heaven"" was a major disappointment. What he could have done w/ those songs was what drew me to the CD. This is just odd, but tight, instrumental Mother's type stuff. Not for the guitar enthusiast."
5,Hey Trey,Hmmmm...recorded in 1987 and released in '88..could this be the blueprint for a band called....Phish?! The Grateful Dead connection to Phish ends with the setlist variety..what Phish really play like is Zappa Lite and the title and various covers of this Zappa release strike me as the lightbulb over Trey's head.
3,Some up's and some down's ...,"I ordered this CD based on the strength of a few songs I had heard elsewhere, namely ""Ring of Fire"" and ""Bolero"". These songs, in addition to ""Stairway to Heaven"" are terrific. Extremely well recorded as well (from an audiophile standpoint). The rest of the album is, well, interesting to say the least. I understand from the liner notes that the band disbanded mid-tour. I can see why, after listening to a few of the recordings here. It sounds self-indulgent, bordering on disaster at times. I can't imagine sitting in the audience for this concert! At times it sounded like all the instruments were dropped down a set of stairs.In summary, Zappa had a great opportunity to have created something exceptional. Instead, we got a mess."
1,disappointing,"The material has been treated in friveless manner and does not have the emotive content or passion of the studio albums. I found it raucuss and not worth listening to. It sounds like they were having a good time but that is not what I want from a Zappa album. I'll stick to Zoot Allures, etc."
4,FCC license has nothing to do with range,"Everyone please understands that getting the FCC license for any GMRS radio does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to increase the range of the radio. The license is a piece of paper so the FCC may track who is using GMRS frequencies, nothing more. They used to do the same for CB users in the 70's. They do not track FRS freqs because of the low output power of FRS radios. Range is affected by output power of the radio but mostly by obstacles between you and the other radio. Trees, walls, buildings, hills, etc. reduce the range considerably. A true test of range is on open water or unobstructed Line-Of-Sight from one hilltop to another. (Not everyone has a boat) Buy three different sets from different brands and try them near a lake to test, return the ones that are not to your liking."
1,1,"Don't buy this book unless you are interested in the Jason Blume story (which is not very interesting), because that is all that the book is about."
2,Getting to the heart of wining is more like it!,"I bought Mr. Blume's first book, ""6 Steps To Successful Songwriting"" and absolutely loved it!! So when I saw this book in the bookstore one day, I didn't hesitate to pick it up. I don't know what Mr. Blume's intentions were when he wrote this book, but it came across to me as nothing more than a b***h session on the problems he encountered before becoming a successful songwriter. Unlike his first book, this one had very few (if any) examples and advice on songwriting. If you're looking for a book that's basically a diary of a songwriter, then this is a great book. If you're looking for a book on how to write songs or hoping for a great follow-up to his first book, don't waste your money."
2,"Nothing to do with ""The Heart of Creativity""","This book is a bunch of brief essays regarding how to sell your songs, organize your songwriting ideas, pick collaborators. It has virtually nothing to do with writing good songs itself. I got this as a present, and feel sad that a friend spent his money on this..."
2,Missing the Mark,"I bought this book in the hopes that the author would have suggestions for creative blocks, specific to writing songs. I have read and used Writing Down the Bones and The Artists' Way as a means to combat writing blocks. Blume's book was really misleading and it is not like Writing Down the Bones. It misses the mark when it comes to being a creative guide for writing songs.There are some useful tips about organizing songs and work material. A few good exercises on setting goals, but I did not find his writing exercises very original or inspiring.If anything, the book only confirmed that I was going in the right direction, but I was hoping for a more creative guide. I suggest The Artists' Way, over this book, for anyone who is trying to unblock their creativity when it comes to writing new lyrics and searching for new ideas.Also, he defends writing songs for Brittney Spears and The Backstreet Boys.....not in good taste, nor do I think those songs are the height of creative genius."
2,Title Should have been Memoirs of an aspiring writer,"While this book is certainly entertaining, a how-to book it isn't. I purchased this 166 page pep talk in the belief thatit would provide insights into the craft of songwriting. Instead, page after disjointed page, regail the reader with tales of the song that made it or the song that almost made it.Not how or why, the song did or did not succede.If I wanted a pep talk, I would play my songs for my friends and family.Don't waste your money on this ""book"""
2,not the audio quality as other Benoit GRP CD's,"I got the impression that it was another official recording/CD but it turned-oout to be low level audio quality Davif Benoit unworthy- stich to the GRP label CD's from David Benoit- that is qualty recording unfortunately there are no sheffield lab recordings from David Benoit, that lable is the best there is for audiophilepeople- Sheffield LabCD's haveincredible sound quality"
1,Third one's a charm? No... I hate it now.,"Yes I actually replaced the original one TWO times. The original was purchased several years ago. In short order the button to retract the cord broke so it was fussy to make work but I used it for ages. I replaced that one eventually and the second one broke just the same way. Mind you both hair dryers continued to work but it was irritating that that darn button broke AGAIN when the retractable cord was the reason for purchasing this model. Anyway bought a THIRD one and guess what? No...actually this time, although the button isn't broken yet, the cord will NOT RETRACT all the way so I give up with Conair. I am purchasing a different brand today and hope their mechanism for retracting the cord is better."
2,"OK for traveling, but ...","I've been buying Conair blow dryers almost since they were invented (I'm 63) and this is the first one I've had a problem with. First of all, I did think it was louder (or higher pitched) than I was used to. Cord, folding, etc. works fine. However, lately I haven't been able to push the switch into the ""High"" position. I thought maybe it had to do with the reset button or something, but no luck. If I still have the receipt, I'll try to return it and get something else."
1,Should AMAZON keep selling this lemon?,It disturbs me that AMAZON keeps selling items after they are clearly lemons!!
1,mine broke!,"I bought this blowdryer a few months ago and all of a sudden it just doesn't turn on anymore... this is after the cord retraction feature already broke earlier. I never dropped it or handled it roughly, so it is quite a mystery. Please save some money and the environment from more trash, and pass on this one."
2,Not unless you like wearing earplugs.,"I was drawn in by idea of a folding handle and retractable cord, but the cord is already failing to retract completely (I've only used the dryer about 3 times so far). I thought 1875 watts would mean a decent air flow, but it's only so-so. I have to keep it on the ""high"" setting to get my hair dry within a reasonable amount of time, and my hair isn't that thick or long.However, my biggest complaint is the EARSPLITTING noise! I wish I'd read the reviews before my purchase, because the critiques about how loud it is are absolutely on the mark. It's not just a high pitch, as suggested by one reviewer. It's an extremely loud hiss that sounds like an industrial factory operating at full capacity, inches from your ear. The ""low"" setting is not quite as loud, but as I explained earlier, the air flow is so wimpy at this setting that you might as well not even bother. I'm going to try and return this thing before I go deaf."
3,Inspirational but limited in information,"I had mixed feelings about this short book. It makes a few points well, energizes the reader, and motivates one to practice fundamental skills until they are mastered. But the book was surprisingly short and contained less information than most. For example, while Guidice champions the bow saw over the familiar European-style saw, he doesn't even acknowledge the now popular Japanese saw. Also, he says that woodworkers should pay more attention to the aesthetic aspects of plans but says very little about the principles of style. He gives almost no advice about buying or using machine tools. When I bought the book, I somehow thought it would contain a series of excercises toward mastering woodworking, but I didn't find a systematic plan of practice. The book is still well worth its price, mainly to reinforce one's motivation and one's appreciation of beautiful work."
2,A American Government Book......not a book on AP Government preparation guide,"I strongly discourage the purchase or use of this book.The book goes far too in depth and the ""sample AP"" questions are unimportant, trivia questions.The only thing in the book which is noteworthy is the glossary. However, it contains too many specific terms which have NEVER nor will NEVER appear on the AP Test.The sample essays found at the end of every chapter are also discouraging. The prompts are poorly written and the responses often center around unimportant things (such as): the family reinforcement act, statistics on Hispanic poverty etc......Buy the Princeton Review Book for AP US Government and Politics.Read it...Score a 5."
5,The Real Deal!,"Monica Edwards is a divorced single mother, now dealing with the dating scene. She finds it difficult to make it in the dating world. Many women can relate to some of the experiences that she goes through in trying to find herself again.In reading this book I found it very easy to follow and I could not wait to find out what was going to happen on the next page. The writer of this book kept me wanting more I read the entire book in one sitting. I would recommend this book to all my single girlfriends. It is a real story for real women. I give the book 5 stars because it is a really good book and I enjoyed reading it. I hope there are more to come!"
4,Telling it like it is,"From reading this book, I can relate to some of the kinds of realtionships that I've been through. I dont see anything desperate about the situation; I can see through the author's eyes the frustration of actually finding a good man; which is a rare commodity these days. I'd definitely refer this book. I cant wait to see what's next!"
2,Where are all of the good men?,"Monica Edwards is a newly divorced single mother trying to survive in the dating world. She works at an airport so she sees many men come and go on a daily basis.In Search Of Good Men, a novel by R.Moreen Clarke, chronicles the dating experiences of Monica, the main character. She meets man after man and falls in love far too easily and far too often. As she enters into relationships with these men she explains why she is so attracted to them and what her feelings are towards them. If this book were a self-help book Monica's mistakes might tell women what not to do while dating, unfortunately this book is supposed to be a novel. In reading the book I did not have any feelings at all towards Monica, it was like she was just there. The book did not have a continuous flow and oftentimes was hard to read. On the RAW scale In Search Of Good Meen is a 2.Reviewed by Simone A. Hawks"
3,so close yet so far away,"im a fan of ska, dancehall, DnB, salsa, pop, and etc. but i really cannot recommend this cd. sure, theyre much better than ozmatli. but they have the same problem. all style no substance. in other words, none of the songs stuck in my head or my heart. i found the music too monotonusly over-produced happy and slick to be truly enjoyable... even though i like some cheesey latin pop music (like DLG).as an alternate blend of futuristic world music, i'll recommend evoka and garmarna"
4,Great beat,"I've never heard about Kingchango before someone i like very much PI told me about this group and beleive me it rocks, with such a eclectic rithems, you'll enjoy THE RETURN OF EL SANTO"
5,Happy Shopper,Got this for my son he loves this movie and I couldn't find it anywhere I was so glad to find it and to be able to give it to him for Christmas. Great price and fast delivery.
1,Deceiving,I am a little dissapointed with the cus words they use. This movie is not rated but appeals to children .I thought it was a family movie we would be able to enjoy. Until the mom started blurting out s#%t and other inappropriate words. Maybe other don't find this offensive or that big of a deal but for us it is. Also there are too many seens that talk place in a pool hall bar type of atmosphere. This may be your thing but this movie was way too explicit for us.
2,"ok, if you are bored.","I'm not going to say it was a bad movie nor a good one. In the beginning the plot developed pretty fast, to get you into to it, then it sort of dragged. I walked out on it a couple of times. The plot was just a little too obvious for me, maybe thats why I didn't enjoy it. You have to watch it yourself. Maybe if they had a better budget the movie could've been better."
4,there is better stuff out there,"this is a great punk cd with some weak cuts but some good ones.1. Mean Girl 8/102. Up All Night 9/103. Sound Siren 5/104. How You Feel 7/105. Blame It On Me 8/106. Seein' Red 10/107. Nick & Phil 9/108. Hellborn 8/109. Geronimo 7/1010. Rescue Me 5/1011. Actress, Model. 10/1012. Raliegh 1/1013. Babylon 5/1014. Raliegh 1/1015. Rest Of My Life 10/1016. It's Alright 7/1017. Evolution 9/10"
2,Not the UL I know,"Oh Wow....I'm sorry to all Unwritten Law fans that have known what REAL UL sound like...As far as Punk....they've scrapped their punk sound somewhat. Although I WOULD say the songs are actually very talent filled and well written, I prefer the old UL with songs such as Coffin Text, and Please tell me Why. This is more not Unwritten Lawish type music. If you are an actual Fan of UL and have known them for awhile, then you might be disappointed. If you just now heard of Unwritten Law b/c of Seein Red, then I guess you'll like it. I cannot appreciate this cd NEARLY as much as Oz Factor, Blue Room, and the Self Titled. It doesn't come CLOSE to those albums. Bummer for Punk fans :( The Bright Side? The songs are well written, and well done, and actually very catchy. Good Job,..... but what happened to punk?"
3,They Can Do Better,"I got into Unwritten Law with their self-titles album form a few years back. When Seein' Red was released onto the local Modern Rock station, I just about screamed, I was so excited to see they had new material out. I bought this album, and though the music on the CD is good, I'm always disappointed when a band feels the need to put answering machine messages and random band banterings on their CDs. It feels like they needed something to fill up the space on an otherwise-finished CD. I'm curious to see how their next album turns out."
2,well,"I heard this, and I thought of how shockingly unorginal some of these songs. I had heard every riff, every note of Scott Russo's voice before. There are some good songs, namely seein' red and sound siren, but some songs just delve into tried and now boring riffs. And the Raleigh songs are just plain bad. There are few bright spots, but other then that, very disappointing."
1,Funny,"These guys were just on Leno, it was very obvious the singer wasn't into it. They all messed up collectively or they might have just slowed down for the singer to catch up. I don't own this album, I just like like laughing at that weak video that tries to be serious. How 'bout the part were the guy thinks he's rocking when it's barely 62 bpms."
3,Is This Unwritten Law,"ok i bought the unwritten law self titled album after hearing Seein Red. then i pick up elva...and its filled with good songs, but it seems they have fell into the popular music area when it comes to writting and the lyrics are no were near the other albums...more meaningless to me...U.L ROCK ON"
5,the best one,well this is the beat unwritten law cd ever! it's full of diversity ! and it show every little personality of the band! it's a really great cd that you can't stop listening to !
4,mature sound with the same fun atmosphere,"I'd have to say that I have tremendously enjoyed this album. I have been a dire unwritten law fan for a very long time, and this cd is a sign of their growth as musicians. The cd is chocked full of variety. Some songs seem less ""hard"" as their previous work, but yet I can still rock out to the cd while driving though PB in the middle of the night with my friends. I feel that Elva is definately their most mature and grown up sounding cd. I would definately recommend this cd to anyone looking for a fun yet talented cd for the summer."
1,Please,"I bought this for ""Seein' Red"", and out of the 17 tracks, this is still the only one I like. Every other song the singer sounds like a 22-year old Elvis. That's all. This [stinks]."
5,Awesome,Unwritten Laws CD Elva was even better then I expected. I listen to the songs that I knew then the others that I hadn't heard before and was like WOW. I love the CD and listen to it all the time I just can't get enough of Unwritten Law! I recommend this CD most definitely!
5,Best Band Ever?,"Elva is one of the best Cd's I have bought all year. The band unwritten law is good for the following reasons: 1.) They write there own music 2.)They put out amazing songs 3.)They can play there instruments. Unwritten Law is different, they are not your 5 guy boy band because they do not need to be on MTV to sell music. Elva overall is a great Cd and my two favorite songs on it are up all night and seein red. I think that everyone needs to buy this cd ..."
5,Perfect mix,"The first time i heard these guys pretty much was at a concert called Snow Jam In my home city Vancouver. After that show i was hooked. I like punk but im picky with it.... I dont like much ""pop punk"" because i find it to cheesy and ""teeny bopper"", and i find alot of ""hardcore"" or ""real"" (not speaking of the lyrics) punk to be boring. Unwritten law is the perfect mix if your like me. Hard fast songs with a dash of ballads substract corny lyrics = one hell of a cd. Favorite Tracks: Seein red, babylon, up all night, mean girl, evolution."
5,Best Yet,"This CD is AWESOME!! I haven't heard much of Unwritten Law but when I got this cd, I INSTANTLY loved it and had problems turning it off. The beats good in every song and the lyrics are tight. I HIGHLY recommend this CD to everyone."
4,Go UL,"I like there new cd. There songs are awsome. But if you liked ELVA you should for sure check out Oz Factor, Unwritten Law, and Blue Room. I know what you are saying no UL isn't a new band. But back to ELVA it already has like 2 hit songs so I mean, come on, they rock! Buy there cd. It is worth every penny."
5,Unwritten Law rocks hard,"Elva will surely make UL famous. Ranging from harder tracks such as ""Evolution"" and ""Rescue Me"" to the reggae like ""How You Feel"", UL puts as much spice into the album as a burrito from Albertos. Highly suggested ;)"
4,Guilty pleasures,"...I bought this, expecting a generic pop-punk album,that I could listen to if I was bored, but I realised that I was being close minded. Somehow, they blend metal, rock and ska into one, and make it work. It's a shame that with riffs from songs like ""Rescue Me"" and ""Babalon,"" that they are pidgeonholded into the pop-punk genre. Other than the two I just mentioned, some standout tracks are ""Up All Night (the second single),"" ""How You Feel (a ska influenced song),"" and ""Actress Model.""This is a strong record, full of very little filler. Fans of Blink 182 will surely enjoy this (because of the pop edge), but hopefully this record will attract fans of different genres."
1,Best lyrics ever,"So followthe leader now,and swallowyour pride and drownwhen there's nowhere left to go...-Unwritten Law-"
4,Elva Rocks,"OK UL Fan, old and new... Here's the lowdown on the new Unwritten Law cd Elva. For all you hardcore punkers, this one is alot slower then Oz factor and the good old CPK days, but in return you get quality and presision song writing. For you new fans this is a great gateway cd to get to the older UL too. While the songs are more MTV style then the earlier releases, UL keep it real putting out awesome rock numbers and cool introspective lyrics. I think it is a very cool CD and would recomend it to anyone who likes punk pop or rock. Rock on UL and keep turning out the killer music!"
5,"""No longer available""? I'm NOT surprised.","I received one of these as a gift about 20 years ago and it is hands down, the best curling iron anywhere at any price. It still works but one of the sides where a screw secures the clamp is out of alignment and I have been unable to fix it. Naturally it has been discontinued. Idiots."
5,Fantastic,"Fantastic Album showcasing some of the best guitar players around. Mike Stern plays wonderfully on this record, really worth buying!"
1,Songs for people with very short attention spans,"With just two exceptions, of the 15 GREAT, live, concert performances available to have been included in this production, all have been trimmed to about 30 seconds in length. For those of you who have attended a performance of James Brown any time in the last 20 years, it will remind you of his technique of trying to fit 6 hours of hit music into 90 minutes. The few measures of Wilson Pickett performing ""Land of a Thousand Dances"" and ""In The Midnight Hour"", Sam Moore (of Sam and Dave) singing ""Soul Man"", Isaac Hayes ""Theme from Shaft"" and finally ""Don't Let Go"" were all HUGE disappointments. Just as each song begins to move your mind, body and soul, it's over."
2,Don't Waste Your Money.,"How can they possibly be asking this much money for this DVD because its not worth it. I recently purchased this dvd and was very disappointed it has five stars listed on the front cover but the songs are very short and incomplete. If you are looking for a concert forget it. IT's just another ripoff, I suggest you rent it before buying it then you won't make the same mistake that I made. For example can you imagine listening to someone else sing Wilson Pickett song 'I'm gonna wait until the midnight hour' when W.Pickett is on the dvd why didn't he sing the song himself because it did not sound very good listening to the guy who wrote it. WARNING it's not worth the amount of money that they are asking for it, it should be around $12 dollars."
5,slim thug is coing to take the game over,"the cd i just crazy. i mean he should have put his version of tippin on 4 4 but it iight.you can just ride out in the whip and jam all day long ashy to classy is great, the interview is real he just let niggas know what tme it is, u dont know i let them haters know wat time it is, miss mary is for every thug if u get me, and 3 king is for them fun night get bang up and boy n blue rides out so to me there is no goin wrong when u pop this in to the cd player"
5,Slim Thugga is doin his thing,I thought the the cd was good i liked the beats they were tight. flows were good to. slim thug is my favorite rapper and i like the fact that he went with the neptunes on his debut album definently worth the money. now we just need to see how chamillionaire will do with the sound of revenge a h-town will be on top.
5,I am over 13 SLIM THUG WILL GO PLATINUM,This cd is a great buy and u will be happy this purchase. Slim Thug is one of many houston rappers coming up and he did a great job on this cd and he should go platinum 3x. Recommend this to anyone who is a fan of houston rappers and just rap in general and this is better than 80 percent of what we call rap out nowadays and i am glad he did not go commercial like most rappers do. I am not saying this is a classic cause its not but it is a great cd. Slim Thug is great rapper and he should in this business a long cause if putting these kind of albums then he will one of the best from houston. BUY THIS CD
4,Pretty tight...Not Super Tight,"This s***'s decent, but it's nothin ground breaking, nothin' new. Typical southern boi drankin purple, smokin purple, Eattin' Steak & Shrimp, Mackin' them thick thighed..carmel skinned honies, always holdin' his steel...u kno...But like i said, pretty tight. Better than Mike Jones....FREE PIMP C!!!!"
5,Awesome Debut,"This cd is of the hook. I like every song on here and he does not go to commercial like most rappers do and thats y I like this cd so much. Favorite songs r dedicate,like a boss,3 kings,this is my life and the rest r good. I recommend this to anyone who likes houston rappers or who like rap. Looks like he will go platinum and I hope he does cause he deserves it. This is a way better debut then dyke jones this guy did not sellout or keep saying his name about a thousand times. Anyway this is a great buy and I hope U BUY THIS CD cause u will not be disappointed with your purchase. Keep it up Slim Thug and cant wait for Chamillionaire who is another houston rapper coming up for his new cd coming later on. Slim Thugs cd is Awesome. Peace Out"
3,Almost Gold...,"Slim Thug is easily the most talented from the Houston triumvirate that gave you ""Still Tippin'"" so it should be no surprise that his album will be the most commercially overlooked. Already Platinum is a solid release, with some improvements over the leaked advance copy. Too bad it feels as if it all comes a little too late. Still this is the best mix of arid, spacey Neptunes beats and some seriously thowed Texan sh*t you could ever imagine. Pharell could use a slap here and there, but cameos from 1/2 of The Clipse and Slim Thugga's posse make up for it."
2,yo (earth sucks),"this is a list of 5 things i hate about yo1. rap is not singing its supposed to be talking, like poetry2. you suck3. why do you care what people listen to4. your probably some fat white guy that lives in the suburbs and has a pet hamster that you pet while you write retarted reviews5. your probably a republican"
1,slim who,know here is man with absoultely no lyrical skillsbaby dont get with a wanksta good girl wants a gangstawhat about girls just want normal people no way can anybody like slim thugeverybody likes a pimp onli weird and freakish people doSLIM THUG ISNT A THUG IF HE WAS HE WOULD BE IN JAIL STUDO GANGSTA GANGSTA
4,"Surprisingly, very good","I had heard of Slim Thug but never got to check out any of his underground stuff. Both he and Paul Wall did save ""Still Tippin"". So I decided to check out his album Already Plantinum, and the truth is this album deserves that status.Slim is on the label Star Trak and he makes his rapping style flow with the Neptunes beats on songs like ""Like A Boss"", ""Playa You Don't Know"", and the song everyone knows about by now ""I Ain't Heard Of That"". And what rap album doesnt have Bun-B on it these days when he collabs with Slim on ""3 Kings"", also featuring T.I.Slim also shows his sentimental side with songs like ""Dedicate"", ""Incredible Feelin"", a Jazze Phizzle produced track, and the this ones for the ladies, ""Miss Mary"".The only missteps on this album would be ""This Is My Life"", and Pharrells attempt to rap on the title track. But overall Already Plantinum is better than some of the other stuff that's out there and is one of the few above-average albums to come out of Houston."
4,Good Debut 4 1/2 Stars,"Slim Thug really surprised me on this album. He is truly one of the best talents to come out of Houston along with Paul Wall. Slim Thug's lyrics along the tight production of the Neptunes and Jazze Pha made this album one of the best rap debuts of the summer. Tracks like ""3 Kings"", ""I Ain't Heard Of That"", ""Click Clack"", ""Ashy To Classy"", ""Playa You Don't Know"", ""Everybody Loves A Pimp"", and ""Already Platinum"" are my favorites. I am looking forward to hearing more from Slim Thug and other artists out of Houston. BKLYNBABYLON signing off..."
4,Its Worth The Purchase,"I must admit I was one of the people who bought the bootleg version of the cd because he kept pushing back his release date. But the cd on bootleg is completely different from the the one just released. The only songs present on this cd that is from the bootleg version is ""I Ain't Heard Of That"", ""3 Kings"", ""Incredible Feeling"", and ""I'm A Boss"" they're all slightly altered for the new cd so it don't sound the same. As for the rest of the songs on the cd, they are all cool, I really like his aproach, his voice is so uniqe. But I've been a fan of the whole swishahouse crew back since 99' when they were doing mixtapes. I have always liked they're style and if you want a slightly different southern rap, then this cd would definately be one to buy. I recommend it to pre teens to because its not as graphic as some of the other southern rappers."
3,One of the better offerings in Houston,"Already platinum is produced by the neptunes and it's debuted by a houston who's not a lil flip imitation, he does good music on this one than any other, I Thought this album is better than Undaground legend (who I Liked) and way better than these two efforts (Who is Mike Jones and U Gotta Feel Me, this is one of the best albums to come out of houston since Scarface.Hopefully chamillioniare will change all that.Thumbs up for me.Music Rating: ***1/2"
2,Already Un-interesting (2 1/2 Stars),"Not very impressed with Slim's debut, no tracks really stood out and caught my attention, i found myself sitting there just listening as each track passed me by and after each one im like 'Is that it?', I actually like Mike Jones cd better than this. Although Slim does have some good flows every now and then the majority of the time they're very mediocre and boring, I do think he's alot better than Flip tho b/c Flip completely sold out which is a going trend now when rappers come from the underground then get a deal and go soft cause of course they dont wanna keep talkin all that hard stuff when they reach a bigger audience and somebody decides to test them on it. Anybody who likes this CD is just from Texas or haven't heard the real kings of the rap game, but this is one of those cd's that I could listen to every few weeks or so not an everyday banger, expected alot more from this guy."
2,thought it would be better,kinda disapointed slim's awesome in other songs with people but some song on this cd dont impress me personally i think his voice and sh*t are fit for songs with like more deeper bass there are a couple songs like that on the cd and there good but others are more iunno bass less.
4,Slim Thug the boss,"I been listen to Slim Thug since i was in the 7th grade and underground, this cd is bad ass and if u dont get it go get it and rep HOUSTON!!!"
4,ALREADY PLATINUM,a GREAT album and one of the best in 2005top 10 songs1.Already Platinum2.Playa you Don't Know3.Boyz n Blue4.3 Kings5.I Ain't heard of That6.Click Clack7.Like A boss8.the Interview9.Dedicate10.Everybody Loves A Pimp
5,It's The H-Town Boss!,I definitely play this CD all the time. Slim Thug be rippin' hot lines. He got talent and that's all I can say cop this album.
4,SLIM THUGGAA,"THE BIG BOSS OF THE SOUTH. didnt like it when i heard he was getting neptunes and jazze pha on the album, i was hoping he'd keep it truer to texas like paul and mike. but the album still goes hard despite being a little more pop than his fans are used to."
3,OK but no Z-ro,This album is just ok. The production is really good. But I can't understand why just ok lyricists like Slim and Mike Jones make it big and the south's best rapper Z-ro is hardly known outside of Texas.
3,JUST NOT IN TO IT!,"OK I GAVE IT 3 STARS BUT NEXT TIME I WONT KNOW FA SHOW,I DOUBT IF I'LL COP THA NEXT!!"
5,just what I wanted,"I was looking for a dragon fly for my grandson, this was the closest I could find and was perfect."
3,I am doubtful,I do not feel very good about this product because I do not know to what temperature works.Please if you can tell me what temperature worksThanks and I hope your answer
3,"Good for the general, bad for the specific","If you're looking for general information (with pictures!) about the countries, this is a great place to start. Beyond that, this probably won't be of too much help. The book does a good job of talking about potential tourist spots, but don't count on it to help you with finding good hotels, places to eat, etc. I would recommend flipping through this in a bookstore to find what country you're really interested in, and then switching back to Lonely Planet for the specifics."
3,"Looks great, very light, a couple minor issues...",Looks really cool as one would expect from the picture -- hip enough to wear outside the tennis court. very lightweight which is great. my only issues relate to the shoelaces -- they're a bit inconvenient to tie -- when I tie them they tend to want to get stuck under the tongue -- also tend to dig in to my foot when i try to lace them tight.
